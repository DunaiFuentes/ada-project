true,Darknezz,tennant,Tennant,"I'd be willing to bet this has a lot to do with conformation and self-selection bias, though. I would imagine that if you saw an American doing a British accent really well, you wouldn't realize they were American unless they were someone super famous, or it's someone you follow closely for some reason. Thus, you see and recognize a lot more of the misses than the hits, because you just don't notice it when it's done well. Case in point, I never realized Hugh Laurie wasn't American until I went to Wikipedia on a whim one day, or that dude-who-plays-Rick on The Walking Dead was as far from a southern good ol' boy as could be.

I say self-selection may play into it for two reasons. One, on the end of the actors; bad actors who do bad accents often don't realize they're doing it poorly, and are therefore just fine doing it in a performance that people will see. Others who want to make sure they're doing it right will shy away, even when their accent is passable, or sometimes even really good. I've seen both of these happen time and again. 

The other side of it is things that you watch; I don't know your viewing habits, but it's possible that the things you watch simply don't have Americans doing British accents in the roles, for any number of reasons. That changes your sample set quite a bit.

What I'm getting at here is that taking on an accent, any accent, is just as difficult as any other accent. Individually, one actor may struggle with one accent over another, but as an actor that plays with accents myself, I don't think any accent is necessarily easier or harder to do, on the whole. It really just depends on the actor, and how much time they're willing to invest in getting it to sound like a real person, as opposed to a person trying to sound like a real person.",0,1370505434,null,0,false,0,cad88eh,t3_1friqq,t1_cad88eh,t1_cad7yn7,null,1430908010,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

    Speech 3: Get to the Point — Clearly state your speech goal, and make sure that every element of your speech focuses on that goal.
    Speech 4: How to Say It — Examines word choice, sentence structure, and rhetorical devices.
    Speech 5: Your Body Speaks — Shows how to complement words with posture, stance, gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact.
    Speech 6: Vocal Variety — Guides you to add life to your voice with variations in pitch, pace, power, and pauses.
    Speech 7: Research Your Topic — Addresses the importance of backing up your arguments with evidence, and touches on the types of evidence to use.
    Speech 8: Get Comfortable With Visual Aids — Examines the use of slides, transparencies, flip charts, whiteboards, or props.
    Speech 9: Persuade With Power — Discusses audience analysis and the different forms of persuasion available to a speaker.

With Carroll sold it leaves only Downing and Henderson on the old contracts. See [this comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1flx8z/rumor_liverpool_eye_henrikh_mkhitaryan_as_a/caccv0f?context=3) for why he has to be sold.

Rodgers attempted to sell him last summer, I don't see what has changed this summer that would change his mind. All that could save him is if he signs a new contract, which I doubt will be offered to him.

I think financially the Henderson deal will work out worse than the Carroll deal. For Carroll we had a loan fee and a year wages paid for him, plus a £15M transfer fee.

For Henderson we don't have that. 

Assume both are sold this summer:

Carroll: £35M + 130 weeks * £80k = £45.4M - 52 weeks wages - £2M loan - £15M transfer = £24.2M

Henderson: [£20M](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13685517) + 104 weeks * £75k = £27.8M

We would need to sell Henderson for £4M and not subsidize his wages to make the deal cost less than the Carroll mistake. I highly doubt that is going to happen.

Our remaining liability for Henderson is £12M in transfer amortization and £11.7M in wages (not taking into account any automatic increases, player extension options, and other shitty terms we had in our old contracts).

I can see us paying half of those wages even if he moves, which would put him at £33.8M total cost vs £24.2M for Carrolll - a much more expensive mistake.",0,1370506062,null,0,1370506557,0,cad8bpw,t3_1fqfsj,t1_cad8bpw,t1_cad86ny,null,1430907967,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I'll copy past my post there:

I've written about this before soooo....

I would be for a female Doctor (I've seen it done before, it's cool). Since Doctor Who is a show that rewrites itself you can do whatever. I'd point out the Corsair thing and River changing race.

For arguments against...

The Doctor has been **white male for 11 incarnations** and some people would feel it odd if he changed. It would be odd but I don't think that's a reason against it. Doctor Who has survived by the long cherished method of ""making stuff up as we go along"". It has no problem bringing in new/weird things or outright contradictions. For example, we had no idea he could regenerate for the first three years of the tv show. How radical would it be to change out the main cast member around whom all the mystery was centered? Yet they changed Hartnell into Troughton. Are we now saying that gender is such a big obstacle that it trumps changing main cast characters?

If we did get a female companion, in the long run years from now, fans of the future would understand exactly why the Doctor was white male for 11 incarnations and then suddenly female: It's the time period. The early 21st century/mid 20th century. The idea of transgenderism (as the Doctor's regeneration could be seen as) is pretty controversial and not widely accepted in today's society.

**Some people feel that gender is a very important part of the character** and believe that gender is one of the fixed aspects of society/their world and that it should not be tampered with (which is also partly why transgenderism is controversial). Personally I feel that gender is useless unless used in a binary (two options: male or female) way. If gender stopped being binary there would be no point in using it as a way to define people and the pressure of comments like ""because you're X gender you should like pink/blue"" would not be a thing. Gender needs to stop restricting people.

Also I feel that the Doctor is not particularly masculine or feminine in a traditional sense. He's not athletic, impulsively aggressive, domineering. He's emotional, sensitive and intelligent. Things that all people can be (and should be imo; even if society goes around telling men they aren't allowed to cry). Including core traits like  intelligence and sensitivity is the Doctor's eccentricity and optimism. These traits are (imo) essential to the character of the Doctor but they are not male-exclusive traits.

**People don't want the character to be a gimmick**, which is a fair concern. Doing a gender swap is a big move and a real minefield. We don't want the Doctor to be making a joke out of being female but also don't want it to be ignored. This one is all up to whether or not you trust the writers to do a good job. I don't know if I do.

Plus, **would anyone buy it**? I have a feeling that the casual audience would flip the heck out. People might cite this time period as the time when Doctor Who finally jumps the shark. There would be backlash. There would be people just *waiting* to see sexism where there is none (or maybe the writers suck at their jobs). It's a minefield.

**The Doctor's relationships** is another concern. What would happen between he and River? How would the companion dynamic change? Well it'd sure be something interesting to explore, that's all I can say. River Song is bisexual so a female Doctor wouldn't be an issue for her. Though you *can* have a romantic relationship without having a sexual one (it's called asexual romanticism as opposed to aromantic asexuality).

**Historical concern** is an issue. The Doctor would be at a disadvantage if she ever visited time periods on Earth (even today in some places) where women are treated poorly (um like all the time periods lol). It's like the crap Martha took as the Doctor took her to past time periods. It would be interesting. It might or might not be addressed. For one thing, sexism towards women in the past wouldn't be an issue if all the Earth stories we wrote about weren't set in European or post-European-contact societies or other societies that treat women as lessers. Also, how big of an issue has being female been for the Doctor's companions who go to past time periods? Not too much. The show glosses that stuff over or it gets a random comment somewhere. If the Doctor was non-white, he (or she) might end up avoiding time periods hostile to them. The current Doctor does this. Has the Doctor ever visited feudal Japan or ancient China?

**In spite of all of this** I would still be interested and would still give it a shot. Plus, there is a spin-off media character called **Iris Wildthyme** who travels through space and time in a red double decker bus that's smaller on the inside armed only with her intelligence and handy sonic corkscrew. She's a batty crazy older woman who likes to drink and has adventures. She's met the Doctor in alt. media and often her stories are parodies of his. In a meta sort of way, Iris seems to think she's had the same experiences as the Doctor (as if she is him) but she also knows her life is a parody of his. She comes from the Clockworks people (code for Time Lords) and is possibly from the Obverse (whatever that is). She's pretty much a female Doctor and great. All her stories are intentionally campy funny and fun but still maintain good writing. Iris is an awesome character and I encourage people to try out a story of hers to get an idea of a female Doctor. Plus she's played by **Katy Manning**, the actress who played Jo Grant, 3rd Doctor companion.

So there are a lot of concerns for a gender (or race) change and I've addressed the main ones here. In the end, some things would change and some things would be addressed. Change is good, addressing is good. Going new places is good. Not screwing up the show with bad writing is also good.",0,1370507055,null,0,false,0,cad8gq8,t3_1frft4,t1_cad8gq8,t3_1frft4,null,1430907901,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Of course I can't tell a good american accent from a great one, so maybe it's the same for everyone, but imo american accents are much easier because we've heard them a lot.

My viewing habits are pretty scattered, but British characters pop up occasionally in pretty much any US television show, and they're almost always embarrassingly bad.

Even if it is hearsay from the wife of a defence lawyer, I can totally see this happening. The fact that so many people's reaction to this story will be, ""huh, not surprising at all"" says something bad about the level of public confidence in the legal system does it not?

The point of the story is to illustrate how important it is to have sound legal advice for absolutely everyone, because there are really many people being falsely accused every day. Especially the most vulnerable people in society - elderly, poor, immigrants - who lack the funds or knowledge to protect themselves.

The government wants to cut funding for this. In their response to the petition, they even state that they don't think ""those who do not have a strong connection to this country"" (ie. immigrants) are worth protecting.

I'll side step the fact that this is not necessarily an anti-muslim attack - until it's been proven and people charged...

but anti-islam sentiment doesn't mean (nor does it lead) to anti-muslim attacks. 

to be anti-islam (or to express anti-islam sentiment) is the same as expressing anti-christianity sentiment. It's anti-'a particular worldview/religion' - which everyone has the right to *be* and to express, should they so wish.

&gt; It's against the Highway Code

Which doesn't necessarily mean it's illegal (till now) as the UK Governments own website goes into [some detail](https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction): *""Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see The road user and the law) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.""*

&gt; It causes congestion, although how much is debatable

This seems very vague...

&gt; It can cause dangerous manoeuvres

So can frequent lane changing. Indeed where before there were cars cruising in one lane you now have *every* car making *at least* two lane change maneuvers each time they want to overtake another vehicle. Then consider the added danger of impatience as faster cars pull out directly into the fast lane to overtake slower cars that have just pulled into the middle lane to overtake slower traffic. The added issue of *everyone* lane changing *constantly* as their speeds exceed other traffic would surely cause a lot more potential chances for accidents than maintaining lane. 

Given middle-lane hoggers tend to hold a speed faster than slow moving trucks / coaches etc. but slower than 'top speed' traffic - they're forever going to be pulling out to pass slow traffic.

I will be going to citizen's advice soon though because my combined benefits don't even meet my rent/bills/frugal food requirements and it's getting a bit silly.

Don't worry about sounding like a cunt, it's a legitimate concern and something I do pay attention to. At the minute I don't smoke all day every day, and I try to avoid that in general unless I'm having a specifically lazy day. In fact for the past week or so I've not been toking at all, and if anything it has a negative impact on my mood, but that is most likely because I'm used to being stoned.

I think my lack of concern for it is because a) it provides benefits with few serious drawbacks as far as I can tell, and b) throughout my smoking 'career' and before then too, I have felt like this, I've felt better, I've felt worse. I've noticed no marked difference besides handling my anxiety a lot better and maybe stopping to think about things once in a while in a more positive manner. It also greatly helps some pain issues I have and is an absolute godsend for that, I certainly wouldn't be here now if it weren't for that saving grace. That said I know plenty of people that smoked for decades and packed it in; they'll still drop acid but they won't touch cannabis.

I definitely think it's right to be careful with it though and I appreciate your concern. I'm not just defending it because I smoke it, far from it - there have been times where I've put a joint down halfway through and not smoked for a couple of days, but then there are days where life is just better stoned, it all depends on what frame of mind I'm in.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"That's a vacuous piece of reasoning; given that it's based on an assumption that do not hold.

The assumption is that there is an unambigious, self-consistant and precise definition of 'orthodox requirements of Anglican Christianity'.  There is not.

If there is such a thing, then it should be quite possible to provide it.

So, in the absence of such a definition, what should be done when someone acts outside of the law, whilst claiming it is within the 'orthodox requirements of the state religion'?  The options are:

1. Law is law, and shall be followed.
2. Refer to some doctrinal committee, who rule that either it is (effectively changing the law), or that it is not.
3. ""Oh, ok, carry on then!"".

Clearly, at this point, the courts hold that option 1 is established as the rule.

The real question that the article should be asking is, 'At what point did the law of the land become stronger than the law of the church?'.  Actually, that makes the assumption that, in fact, at some point it _was_.  I can see no reason to make such an assumption.

Lets look at the point that the Church of England separated from the pontificate.  How was this done?  Why, by an act of parliament, the Act of Supremacy, 1534.

How can it be, if the Church is above parliament, that parliament wrote the rules governing the Church?

Further, the act itself established that the sovereign shall:

&gt; ... amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, ...

(Yes, that's a part of a single sentence - the whole Act is a single sentence!)

Importantly, the act itself make reference to some law that might limit things.  (Although I grant that the precise meaning of that phrase might me more subtle that it would be in modern english).

Therefore:  The Anglican Church has _never_ been above the law of the land; nor has the behaviours of it's followers been allowed to enjoy the privileges [0] that the piece asserts are a requirement for a State Religion.  Instead, what has happened is that Parliament has written laws to take account of the Anglican beliefs, where they deem it appropriate to do so.

Empty road, idiot driving along in the middle lane for miles on end. Someone driving faster, presumably in the left hand lane, has to go into lane 3 to overtake, rather than lane 2. Annoying but not really that important.

Slow lane fairly busy with 50mph traffic. You are doing 70mph, constantly overtaking, no real opportunity to pull over because you would be straight back out again. The idiot behind is tailgating you because he wants to do 90, but doesn't want to go into the fast line to overtake as a matter of principle. Are you really doing anything wrong?

Slow lane virtually empty, other two lanes congested. Everyone wants to be moving faster, but the traffic won't let them. Nobody uses the left hand lane, everybody wishes the guy in front would pull over. What do you do, prosecute everyone?

I will paste it into notepad in order to respond however considering how much your argument made sense.


&gt; but it's like you didn't even see him last season when he came in for us. 

We see this repeatedly in football. A player who comes to a new league and hits a golden run of form straight off the bat, but never repeats it. This is often due to a perfect storm of a number of factors- some in his control (form, confidence, will) and some out (defenders not knowing his game, and not being able to defend correctly). With Jelevic it was clearly a case of both, and also a lot of luck- he was scoring a freaking amount of chances, and got lucky with a good number of them.

If you look back at the tape though, the most important point is how defenders react to him- over the summer this changed unimaginably. For his goals last season defenders reacted to him as they would to a typical forward with decent speed- hold off slightly and keep goal side. 

This is the best option with most forwards; young players are coached to know that getting to close to smaller, more mobile forwards when they are being given ball to feet is a dangerous move, simply because it is so easy for them to get the turn on you- with Jelevic though this was suicide, because of his ability to take a shot with a first touch.

This season players have learned that he is not that agile, and as strong as a 6 year old. Simply getting close to him will cause him to fall over, and on the rare occasion that he doesn't he is not quick or agile enough to get around even the slowest CB, so will end up snatching at his shot.

&gt; It's not cause they weren't playing tight enough or anything, he just got played the ball more and was more precise with his feet. 

Yes it is. Go back and watch the goals, there is a very noticeable difference in the way defenders react to him. He may have got the ball played to him slightly less, but 20% is not going to make as much of a difference as we have seen. 

&gt;The defenses didn't get any better,

You keep saying this, it is almost like you have not been watching the games this year. Defences have learned his game and have been drilled how to deal with him. Even Jags said so in an interview [source](http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/everton-defender-jagielka-jelavic-being-worked-out-3756521#.UbBrSGTwKRo).

&gt;he just didn't play as well, and to be honest, all the play time that got taken away from him for Anichebe affected him

The reason he was dropped for Anichebe is because of how he was playing. Even Moyes had lost faith in him and felt it necessary to put Victor in, who is just as much of a liability, and there is no argument about that.

&gt; and the fact that Fellaini became the target man meant a lot less balls came in for him. 

As I say, he gets something like 20% less final third touches for game, I could understand if his scoring went down 20%, but it is far greater than that.

&gt; You'd probably be interested to know that he also scored the same amount of goals as Anichebe (our other striker, where's your hate for him?) and Osman this season and more than Baines or Pienaar. I really feel like you don't really know what you're talking about.

Anichebe is woeful, this is a well known fact. He is a Championship level player who is lucky we are desperate for anybody who can bundle a goal in, and Osman is a supporting midfielder... Go back and re-read that statement. 

You are defending him by saying a supporting midfielder has scored as many goals as him. That is shameful. Jelevic has no place in a Premier League side unless he can adapt his game, this season has shown us that he simply is not good enough, and I cannot think of a single player in the history of the PL who has had such a poor season, then gone on to be solid.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","I do see what you're saying, but consider the following scenario: 

Dual carriageway. Line of 30 cars and one truck at the head of the line - the truck is going a good 15 miles an hour slower than the rest of the traffic. All cars are behind the truck at first but as they approach the truck they pull out to overtake and pass. In theory all is fine, *but*... 

Then someone 8 cars back behind the truck decides to pull out far in advance of the point where they need to overtake so that they're not boxed in behind the slow moving vehicle. Their speed creeps up and they start to overtake a few other cars on the approach to the slow truck - effectively boxing them in. Other cars in the line see this and also don't want to be boxed in so *they* pull out to start to overtake. 

Before you know it - the rest of the cars are in the outer lane so as not to be stuck behind the truck and forced to brake. 

I dare say most drivers have seen something like this happen in their years - it's common. Nobody wants to be forced to dramatically slow and wait for a window to open up and allow them to get into an overtaking position and drivers typically don't act as a pack or shoal of fish - they're selfish and only care about being able to get on with *their* journey - not about the overall traffic flow. 

So whilst I see what you mean, average traffic flow will result in an agitated state and force a 'kill or be killed' mentality.

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Empty road, idiot driving along in the middle lane for miles on end. Someone driving faster, presumably in the left hand lane, has to go into lane 3 to overtake, rather than lane 2. Annoying but not really that important.

I would say that this is a classic case of driving without due care and attention. It doesn't matter how fast you are going, if there is no traffic ahead of you in the left hand lane then you should pull into it.


&gt; Slow lane fairly busy with 50mph traffic. You are doing 70mph, constantly overtaking, no real opportunity to pull over because you would be straight back out again. The idiot behind is tailgating you because he wants to do 90, but doesn't want to go into the fast line to overtake as a matter of principle. Are you really doing anything wrong?

No, if you are passing slower traffic in the left hand lane then you are doing nothing wrong. 

&gt; Slow lane virtually empty, other two lanes congested. Everyone wants to be moving faster, but the traffic won't let them. Nobody uses the left hand lane, everybody wishes the guy in front would pull over. What do you do, prosecute everyone?

Yes because they all should be in the left hand lane if it is empty. In this case you should either pull into the left hand lane anyway (because you will be travelling at the same speed as if you were in the middle lane) or try to overtake. This situation only happens because somewhere at the front is a middle-lane hog

It's wrong to regard them as ""slow"", ""middle"" and ""fast"" lanes. The left hand lane is your default lane, the middle lane is your first overtaking lane, and the right hand lane is the second overtaking lane.

Now to the argument I will adress your points but first some general observations. The author has been accused of carefully mixing fact and assertion to create a misleading image. Also why does no major news source pick up his story? You might claim that the media is corrupted (I don't subscribe to this but that's another argument). But the fact that there is a Guardian article and a BBC article which you mentioned criticising Bildeberg shows that even if the media was corrupted (which it isn't or atleast it's not in league with a world government) there would still be places willing to report this. Why do they not do this? Because the guy's claims aren't credible. Next some basic problems with the concept of a secret world government. In your model you would need every major political and buisness leader on board. Leaving aside the already raised ideological differences between these people, how does this organisation ensure those who are elected or get rich support them. Anyone who follows current affairs can see how incredibly difficult it is to one influence things sucg as the US election (millions of volunteers deployed for very marginal gains floating voters are rare) and two predict markets. How do they control these things? Even if it were possible of doing so the number of people needed would make secrecy impossible.

Now for adressing your points. I can't refute all of them lacking the expertise and time to research them. However for the final one I would say by a certain point in the election Obama was manifestly in a very strong position so thus if someone were to tell him it was his to lose was an obvious observation on electoral politics. If Hillary dropped the birth certificate attack it was because it made her seem cheap using false rumors and associated her with a wing of the Republicans most detested by the Dems. And finally a general observation I would like a list of every claim this guy has ever made. If you make enough predictions you can cherry pick those that occur as ""evidence"" of yout unique spurces of information. I sincerely doubt all or even many of the claims he has made have occured. I don't need an in depth knowledge of Bildeberg for this only rational cynicism.",0,1370518242,null,0,false,0,cad9xos,t3_1fq7lo,t1_cad9xos,t1_cad2b9y,null,1430907137,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Most people will move over if they see you approaching fast from the rear and, with the traffic spread out, there is always room to move over.

In peak/mid-peak hour on the motorway, the left lane is head-to-tail with trucks who always have to move into the middle lane to let people in on the slip roads. The right lane is reserved for German cars.

Hell, I'd wager that drivers sit in the middle lane predominantly *because* they want to avoid slow moving traffic in the slower lane and are too lazy to deal with overtaking it on a frequent basis.

There really *aren't* thousands of different situations. There either is traffic or there isn't and when there is - it will be one of a group of types that probably numbers under a hundred (HGV's / slow traffic, cars, motorbikes, bicycles and other traffic sub-sets that you might care to name). Then we factor in speed of traffic, level of congestion (low / medium / high, or number of cars over 200 yards if you like). That covers 90% of what we need to worry about here. Then what.. road works? accidents? animals on the road? After that we're into the territory of rare road occurrences that barely need consideration for a case like this. 

There, nowhere near thousands of different situations - I just covered the majority of variables in about 6 lines. 

Call me a skeptic but I'm starting to wonder if this is more about easing congestion or about raising another income stream for a budget-cut stricken government department.

In WW2 Finland, a tiny and newly born nation was fighting for its survival against the massive Soviet army. They managed to maintain their independence, a lot more than most nations bordering Russia did, and to do this they accepted training, material, and even yes, Nazi troops stationed in Finland. They were not allies, they were co-belligerents. Germany and Finland had common cause against Russia, and for that reason, in that theatre, they fought together. No-one would seriously say Finland was part of the ""bad guys"" in WW2, yet they fought right alongside them for a time (before, later, fighting against the Germans at the very end).

In this case, what you have with the Syrian opposition is a wide variety of groups, from homegrown militia, to foreign sponsored fundamentalists, to the core of the FSA, the military defectors, and a whole lot of other groups and individuals too. The FSA leadership, not that they really lead much more than the defectors, have already quite publicly stated that the second the war against Assad ends they know they have to fight a new one against the fundamentalists, but for now, they are co-belligerent.

It's extremely frustrating to read people with a lack of understanding or context try to ""boil this down"" - some things *shouldn't* be simplified because to do so is to misunderstand everything. This characterisation by Oborne of this being a purely religious conflict is actually quite revolting, not to mention incorrect.

The real point to note here, is that David Cameron, whatever you think of him as a person, by virtue of his many military and civilian advisers, and the people we will have on the ground in Syria, knows far far more about this war than any of us, and is in a different league than the average person on the street who, from a little experience on chatting about the conflict with friends, know essentially nothing about it.",0,1370521254,null,0,1370521528,0,cadagmt,t3_1fs9ev,t1_cadagmt,t3_1fs9ev,null,1430906889,58,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,58

Nobody uses the left hand lane, everybody wishes the guy in front would pull over. What do you do, prosecute everyone?

&gt;Yes because they all should be in the left hand lane if it is empty. In this case you should either pull into the left hand lane anyway (because you will be travelling at the same speed as if you were in the middle lane) or try to overtake. This situation only happens because somewhere at the front is a middle-lane hog.

See that's it though. Apart from the theoretical ""someone at the front"" everyone else is just trying to get by him. They need to be middle, to be able to pass on the right when the opportunity comes. They aren't going to do that sat left of a queue of traffic that in reality they need to be right of.

So the left lane is empty, middle lane is full and doing 60, right lane is full and also doing 60.
I'd like to do 70 but can't, I'm a responsible law abiding driver who doesn't want to get fined so drop from the middle lane to the left lane. Can I now do 70? nope, am I left matching the middle lane anyway. When in actual fact I'd like to overtake all of these 60mph numpties (on the right). The only thing that moving left, does is move me away from the overtake I'd like to make.

Oh wait what's that ahead? well it's a JCB doing 35... bugger. It seems the queue of traffic in the middle lane is stuck behind all those trucks overtaking the JCB. What? None of them will let me in? Shit now I'm stuck behind this fucking digger going 35 and not even going fast enough to join the middle lane, unless someone slows down to let me in.

Now those truck pull in. I'm trapped left. Traffic in the middle actually starts moving past the digger and the trucks. Except me. I'm left waiting for someone nice to let me in. Maybe someone does, maybe they don't and I'm left waiting for the whole queue to clear. Oh wait there goes the guy who was sat behind me in the queue. I actually end up getting past the truck much later then if I'd have just stayed planted in the middle lane queue.


Yes' everyone should drop left, but when no one else does?  It's the one who makes the first move (to admittedly do the right thing) who loses out, who gets trapped in the left lane behind a caravan, and then can't get back into the hogged middle lane.",0,1370522005,null,0,false,0,cadam40,t3_1fs411,t1_cadam40,t1_cad9uzo,null,1430906817,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He might chose to let you out but 1) If the speed differential is high enough, that will slow down the traffic behind him therefore the overall speed of the road.  2) He can't be sure you want to get out unless you are indicating.  And you really shouldn't be indicating in that situation as it may make people think you are going to barge out into traffic.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"Well what I think happened is that the British Union of Fascists, not content with holding large rallies and public marches in places like Trafalgar Square, decided to be extremely provocative and march through the heart of the East End, which at the time was the home of about 90% of British Jews. It's worth pointing out that the BUF was an openly militaristic Fascist party, closely modelled on the Nazis and which had adopted many of their policies and beliefs, including a British adaptation of Hitler's slogan of ""1 million unemployed Germans / 1 million Jews in Germany"".

Unsurprisingly the Jewish population of East London weren't too impressed with this idea, and asked the authorities to ban the march. The authorities pointed out -- as you said -- that they had no legal aspect for banning the march and that it would go ahead. What's more, they announced that due to fears for their safety, they'd give the Fascists had a police escort to ensure the march took place.

So the people of the East End -- predominately Jewish but also non-Jews -- decided that they would take matters into their own hands. They poured into the streets in their tens of thousands under the slogan that every anti-Fascist group has used since -- ""They shall not pass!"" -- and assembled at the top of Cable Street.

Pitched battles were fought, women leaned out of windows to throw down pots and pans at the Fascists and the police who were protecting them, and they were driven off the streets. It was also the beginning of the end of the BUF. Only a couple of years earlier Oswald Mosley was being lauded by the aristocracy and the newspapers as the great saviour of the British against the threat of Communism; within 4 years of Cable Street the Second World War had started and he was locked up as a threat to national security.

So that's what happened. What specifically did I disagree with in what you said? Firstly you said it was ""left wing thugs kick[ing] off as per usual"" that stopped the BUF march. It wasn't. There were undoubtedly Communists and Trade Unionists in the crowd that stopped the march but the vast majority of people there were ordinary men, women and children from the local community.

Secondly: ""There is no law against having marches"". Indeed not, but there is now a law against political parties having a paramilitary side, or even wearing paramilitary uniforms. That law was introduced as a direct result of what happened at Cable Street, as it was considered that the mental image of Mosley's ""troops"" wearing their blackshirts and goose-stepping through the East End was a major reason why the opposition to them was so intense.

A deeper discussion here is if this is harmless fun or if people taking part are just convincing themselves it's harmless so they can justify making sexist jokes.

The serious sexism where the person actually believes what they are saying. Generally I rarely see that in anyone below 60 or so.

There are always large and increasing numbers of small-scale anarchist projects around the world implemented and continuing with varying degrees of success.  We live (mostly) and we learn. 

It's also fair to say that the large scale attempts at revolutionary anarchism the world has seen so far were not unqualified disasters, although they were both (taking the two obvious ones) ultimately failures.  Neither anarchist Catalonia nor free Ukraine collapsed due to human greed, both survived, and in the case of Spain prospered for years, until they were crushed by treacherous State socialist ""allies"".  That does mean, any putative revolutionary anarchist movement of the future needs to be a lot better prepared to defend itself effectively and a lot less trusting of Leninsts/Stalinists/etc. if it is to inspire any confidence in its participants.

On the other point, yes of course, Marxism, socialism and anarchism in all their many hues have always always been philosophies grounded in abundance and not scarcity.  Indeed, Marx himself always said capitalism would have to finish its work before a Marxist revolution could ever lead to a communist utopia, and assumed it would be somewhere like Germany or the UK which would make the transition.

The problem with this argument is that as I, overtaking you, approach you.. I need to change across all three lanes to get around you, and then legally move from the far right lane, all the way back to the left hand lane.

Whilst driving a straight line is ultimately easier for you, it makes life difficult for other motorists and effectively reduces the number of overtaking lanes from 2 to 1. You are shutting down the left most lane if you're travelling slower than me, because it cannot be used by anyone. In fact, anyone going faster than you, illegal or not, is put into the dangerous position of having to use what is now a duel carriageway rather than a motorway.

Could it not be true that, given that most supermarkets don't always keep every till staffed any way, that these staff then have other responsibilities in store? That is to say, as the throughput can be much higher, as you need only one member of staff per 10 or so auto-checkout machines, they can afford to employ more staff to clean, restock and other duties or pay their current staff better wages.

As for the sexism thing, I think it does still exist but quite often find that it's hard to pinpoint specifically in my line of work. I work in science (where there is plenty of ego), and I am told by some studies and some quite vocal female colleagues that there is a large amount of sexism especially when it comes to the application process for job roles. However - and of course anecdotally - having asked several female colleagues if they have ever suffered direct sexism, there generally doesn't seem to be that much that goes on.

At CAM it is Cou, Suarez, Allen/Fabio/Iago. At RW it is something like Suarez/Downing/Iago, Sterling/Fabio. If Suarez leaves it would be more like ST: Sturridge, Fabio/Iago. LW Sterling, Fabio/Iago. CAM: Cou, Allen/Fabio/Iago. RW: Downing/Iago, Sterling/Fabio. And Hendo can fill into nearly any position if we want a higher work rate and someone who will track back. 

I guess from what all I've read he doesn't seem like a big upgrade from someone like Fabio brings to the team. I'm not excited that he'll probably play mainly play on the wings. Asking a soon to be 26 year old striker, who has had two good seasons in his career (and only one of them being at a top league), to move to a different position/club/league/country leaves me apprehensive. He'll have to track back and defend a lot since our backs have struggled at times. I don't know if he is used to it, or even remotely capable of doing it.

If Suarez leaves and we bring in Mkhitaryan, we'll effectively have 2 CAM playing behind Sturridge and a striker-converted-winger as well. I feel as if it is too much of a similar type of player in the ""3"" of the 4-2-3-1. Rafa managed to pull if off some-what at Chelsea this year, but from watching them it never really worked well even though they got 3. I'd prefer we kept the money and went out and bought a top winger and powerful striker with the Suarez money. A winger to give us some width since MK and Cou would drift inside, and a powerful forward that would provide Sturridge with some competition and he'd add a different dimension to our play.

I suspect in your instance of standing in line you were in front of two working class chaps (and I'm going to make a few leaps of assumptions) that were working class and therefore doing the typical working class roles a lot of women can't/would have a hard time doing (labouring/brick laying/manual labour/hefting boxes around warehouses) and his reference to the cash till was something he was used to being served by a woman who (if they're working class) would consider supermarkets as a job to come back to after a pregnancy (being unskilled and recovering this exudes them from manual labour posiitons as well as the fact supermarkets tend to be fairly accomodating in shifts to fit mothers). 

I kind of see his point even though it's technically not right. What this sub (and often the middle class) forget is that life is a LOT tougher for the working classes and as a result traditional gender roles (ie. sexist gender roles) work better in their communities (labouring jobs are hard to come by and when they do come by them they're usually all day where as supermarket/till work is generally more accomodating to young  parents). 

The 2nd example is simple sexism disguised as jealousy in being inadequate. 

Sexism is less prevalent in the middle class brackets as the middle classes tend to have taken precautions and have made concsious decisions to put off parenthood until their mid 30s and therefore concentrate on their careers and not just muddle through with different jobs to make ends meet etc.

If this is your first encounter I seriously doubt you deal with UK society as a whole outside of your (sorry for judging btw) middle class clique. 

I'm also quite sexist against my wife (I slap her bum a lot and call her ""sugar tits"") and tell her to make the ""man of the house"" a cup of tea. But this is a little (slightly sexual) game between us which she enjoys by wearing heels and 50s dresses in. 

She gets me back by making me do stereotyped DIY stuff and BBQ's gender roles.

People don't understand that you can modify a large population's behavior with small changes. Want to make less people buy cigarettes? Stop putting them on display. It is still easy as anything to actually *buy* cigarettes, but maybe it puts off 1 out of every 100 transactions. That is the affect.

In the case of fags, the marginal benefit vs the marginal cost of hiding them from display makes sense.

In the case of the internet, without having done a survey myself I think the relatively large marginal cost of introducing an opt-out internet censor probably wouldn't compensate for the marginal benefit.

But we should stop pretending that just because a new measure doesn't have a **large** effect, that it has **no** effect. There are 60 million people in the UK, you only need to influence one in a thousand people to be having a pretty significant impact.

&gt;The term Gallifreyan was often used interchangeably with Time Lord, despite indications that not all Gallifreyans were members of the Time Lord society. The Gallifreyan species existed for aeons before the time of Rassilon and Omega, the founders of Time Lord society.

&gt;At one point in Gallifreyan history, members of Gallifreyan religious orders who were not Time Lords were nonetheless given certain rights: access to time travel, certain genetic privileges, and the right to observe High Council procedure. However, the High Council later disestablished the churches, monasteries and other religious orders, effectively abolishing these rights. (PROSE: Interference - Book Two)

&gt;Time Lords may have been just Gallifreyans in possession of a TARDIS. (AUDIO: Omega)

...

&gt;Even within the Time Lord sanctum of the Capitol, ""plebeian classes"" existed. (TV: The Deadly Assassin)

&gt;This reference may well indicate the presence of ordinary Gallifreyans, rather than just Time Lords, in the Capitol. In fact, it remains unclear whether particular groups, like the Chancellory Guard belong to the Time Lord or one of the common Gallifreyan classes.

I'm glad that it seems the owners saved their money for Summer, just because it means we might not be as skint as I think we are. And I hope that ""shortfall"" is gone by now. However, I do find it a bit odd that the new owners would directly request NW staying as part of their takeover (even though Bates supposedly wanted him out) but didn't give him any money in January and seemed to kind of give up on the season just after they had taken over. Glynn Williams' involvement in the club seems to be a bit of a worry too, as well as the divide between the youth/development squad and the first team. McDermott seems like the kind of guy to fix that though, and for all I know Warnock could've easily just been misinterpreting some banter. Lucy Ward has also said that it was partly due to the fact that he actually didn't pay attention to the development squad [in some words or less](https://twitter.com/lucywardleeds/status/342644666547716099).

Ross has said that his part was ""bollox"" though on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Rossmccormack44/status/342639340247187456). But I don't know what to believe anymore.

Some guy on twitter is also quoting other parts of the book, I'll include them here.

I think it's safe to say that not a single country that fought a white/red civil war was untainted by fascism. Traditionalist Authoritarianism arose as an opposition to Bolshevik Authoritarianism, imo. That said, at no time after the war was Finland seriously leaning towards going the way of the southern European states which embraced the old riding boots.

&gt;Their war was undoubtedly mostly nationalist, patriotic and anti communist rather than fascist, and whilst there were some legitimate questions regarding the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war (undoubtedly a two-way thing) and concentration camps for civilians, there's no record of gross anti-Semitism/racism.

More than that, the Finnish volunteer waffen SS battalion was the only battalion of the entire SS to never be so much as accused of war crimes. The Finns also did a fantastic job of getting potential holocaust victims away from the Nazis, never handed over a single person the Germans asked for, and in general were really quite clearly just after an independent nation in which they could live in peace. They also, somehow, kicked the Nazi forces in Finland *out* of Finland while simultaneously disarming after signing a peace treaty with the soviets.

You should avoid the topic of politics unless of course you are in good company with people you can trust so this way you can avoid walking on eggshells. We do like to share our experiences with visitors but people can get very defensive over certain things i.e. Northern Ireland being British or Irish so its usually better to avoid the discussion. There is more to NI than our crappy politics and you'll find those motivated by politics here are a minority. 


&gt; it's not so much the threat of violence that bothers me -- after all, Belfast has low crime rates, and I am from a country where gun violence is taken as part and parcel of city life.

I grew up through the troubles like many of us in r/northernireland but I can tell you now that I felt more safe here at home than I did when I moved to the U.S. The ghettos scared the crap out of me and the cops always seemed to be super aggressive. Thats an experience that I can never wrap my head around to be honest. 


&gt; Will the locals hear my accent and lower their expectations accordingly?

Nah, we get plenty of American visitors here and we're a warm bunch really. Once you get your feet settled and start making friends you'll probably love it here. 


I don't know of the best local websites but I think r/northernireland is probably your best place because people here don't stand for any bullshit. 

I hope you enjoy the craic here :)

Everton may be able to spend some money this summer, but I could see it being a tough year as always - like Arsenal I think they'll be fairly static and their final position will depend on what goes on around them.

I always loved Kalou (and unlike most people on this subreddit I think he should have stayed). You never heard a whimper out of him about being rotated for and he came up with some big goals (at Benfica). I know his consistency was an issue, but he served the club very well and I think he offered much more than Marko Marin. I still catch myself humming his song too. 

I haven't seen enough of Bony to determine if he would have a similar temperament either. But I think we should sign him, let him gain experience in the PL next term, then allow him, Lukaku, and either Ba or Torres (not both) to compete for the striker position in 2014-1015. 

I'd be ecstatic if we brought in Felliani, he would provide us with even more versatility. Either of the Bender brothers would be excellent signings and/or Marco van Ginkel would be a great addition too IMO.

All of these things probably at the 'less horrific' end of the scale as well.  I've got a photo somewhere of two cats in a cage at the door of the kitchen at a hotpot place, presumably next on the menu.

To an extent, I concur.  Certainly mere procedural democracy in the political realm has proved less than liberational.

&gt;if put into the economic sphere would mean instead of a hundred bosses fighting over you you just have 1 who tells you how its going to be and if you dont like it you're the exception, the asshole who cant just get along with how ""the people"" want things to be

I think this speaks to a very privileged type of silver collar worker, and I can see why such a worker, who is constantly in demand and headhunted for high paid jobs overflowing with benefits, would feel this way given the current knowledge economy.  Having said that, capitalism will inevitably ultimately diminish these workers to the same status as any other over time, because all the usual incentives are there to do so, and the outsourcing and automation and dumbing down via technology etc. is already well underway.  Being a programmer, say, today, may be quite pleasant, miners' or printers' jobs were always less pleasant physically, but they would have felt the rewards were commensurate, yesterday...  Times change, and the bosses do not want to compete over you, they want to commodify you.

The reality for most workers is that they compete for jobs, often at ludicrous odds, and the value of their labour is driven towards the floor as a consequence, especially in a country like ours with some of the toughest anti-combination legislation in the capitalist world.

Personally, I'd rather live in a world without bosses, where people who work get the full worth of their own labour returned to them and are free to work for themselves, or together with others, without being forced into a corporate sausage-machine to make money for someone else.  That takes ownership and control of our own working lives...

That seems to be fairly good odds.""[1][3] The article concluded with a mock disclaimer: ""Uni Lad does not condone rape without saying ‘surprise’.""[7]

&gt; The Zebra Abortion – this article described how, following sex, the writer told his sexual partner to take the morning-after pill. After responding by saying she wanted to keep the pregnancy, the writer considers ""performing an elbow drop on her vagina right there and then"", but decides instead to ""look around the room for a chair or table I can smash onto her stomach"".[8]

&gt; How To Pull a Fresher – Another article on the website gave advice on ""How To Pull a Fresher"", noting that fresher students were ""especially vulnerable"".[1]

&gt; The Angry Shag – This story described a man, during sex, smashing a woman's face into a wall ""to knock some sense into her"".[9]

Bullshit. You might not remember it but you were told and its in the highway code you had to read.

All the arguments are wrong.

1) It is not safer. It causes other drivers to act irrationally and if you have a breakdown you can end up stuck in the middle of a live motorway. All lsnes are 70MPH. There is no such thing as a slow, medium and fast lane - only dickheads unfit to hold a license think of them like that.

2) You are driving at what your speedo tells you is 70MPH. That can be anything from 63MPH to 70MPH. Most people who hog the middle lane do not do anything approaching 70MPH. They force traffic wanting to get past into L3 which then ends up with a very congested L3 whilst L1, the lane they should be in is empty.

&gt; Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.

Every thread i've posted about Henderson is downvoted into oblivion, no debate. Noticed the same when others post anything critical.

The funny thing is that these opinions are usually on the edge of what becomes mainstream later. I remember being downvoted and yelled down for thinking Carroll should go, same with others criticizing Coates, Shelvey, Assaidi etc. eventually these become the bandwagon opinions and overnight everybody forgets that only 24 hours ago these opinions were being yelled/downvoted down. Collective amnesia.  

&gt; No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.

check. realized that when I [questioned Rodgers' ability in the transfer market](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1fd9tc/liverpools_early_transfer_dealings_indicate/ca9d7s4)

&gt; Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.

/r/soccer and all the other subs are stupid and crazy and wrong. and stupid.

&gt; The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing ""truth"" or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.

50% of the top 10 stories on this sub are usually from the official Liverpool site. If not it is from a source that just re-affirms the primary opinion.

etc. etc. If I could be bothered checking comment history I would link more examples, but some of you likely know what i'm talking about.

On a more serious note, I'm steadily giving up on this sub and not checking comment threads as frequently. It isn't because I get downvoted, I could care less about that, its because any non-bandwagon opinion is ignored and insulted - it isn't even debated. The cult here is so strong that you can't even raise a question of the mainstream opinion, let alone debate it.

Anything contrary to the cult view is downvoted. A soccernet and guardian post about Alonso being linked to Chelsea was downvoted to -20, while any shitty blog posting a rumor of a player linked to Liverpool is voted to the top of the sub. Don't even [suggest a rumor that is being widely reported](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1fs5p0/rumour_liverpool_target_tevez/) either.

I've been called an idiot, a nit, an asshole and received dozens of insulting PM's after the threads I posted about why I think Henderson should be sold and other unpopular opinions/topics. I should note that the same thing happen last summer when I said Carroll should be sold (one person replied to another comment later saying 'aren't you the dickhead that said Carroll would be sold, hahaha!' and it got 10+ upvotes). Again, the collective amnesia. 

I don't even know where to begin on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1fek82/everybody_chill_the_fuck_out/), which was just a complete clusterfuck. 

Layered ontop of this one-track bandwagon is this feeling of superiority - the people at /r/soccer are crazy heads and fans from other teams/subs are always wrong.

This is just them filling space, though. You'll notice that there is no name on the byline, which generally means that they've seen or heard of it elsewhere - with no definite source - and decided to take a punt (if it happens, they'll give themselves a pat on the back; if it doesn't happen, they will know that people will have forgotten this article by the time they realise that it hasn't happened).

However, I am reasonably certain that this is going to happen. *The Sun* reported it as something that was definitely going to happen - with a journalist's name actually attached to the article - and Andrew Haigh also broke the news on Twitter a while ago; he is usually right when it comes to Leeds United news. Moreover, this story has been reported in a few different locations now and isn't going away. It would also tie in with McDermott saying that four different footballers have been approached. This also fits our usual M.O. towards the transfer window: signing players nearing the end of their career on a free (regardless of the quality possessed by these players, it's how we roll).

I actually hope that it happens and look forward to seeing what Hunt could do in a Leeds shirt. I read elsewhere (it might have been in the *YEP*) that Reading offered him a one-year extension but he turned it down because he wanted something more long-term, so it is somewhat comforting that Reading - who I expect to gain promotion next season - actually wanted him to help get them out of the Championship.",0,1370537664,null,0,false,0,cadfrt8,t3_1fs24v,t1_cadfrt8,t3_1fs24v,null,1430904386,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

They don't tell you what they want properly, and what requirements they _do_ specify are usually approx three times more than the money or budget allocated, right out of the gate, then every five minutes for the next six months they remember a new requirement they forgot to mention and which is definitely a _must have_, and if that means undoing the last three weeks of work then oh well too bad, and then they then moan when they don't get a perfect system that does all the things they didn't tell you it needs to do, on time and on budget.

What I do know is that thread on /r/soccer has basically devolved into an anti-Spurs circlejerk (a trend that sadly seems to be growing). 

There are plenty of varied opinions about him if you consult more than two sources. Ultimately football executives are a very hard thing to judge without being in the boardroom or being at the table when someone conducts a deal. 

The knock on him in /r/soccer is that he only succeeded because his teams had a lot of money, yet I think the most impressive aspect of his track record is the buying of young prospects like De Rossi and Higuain. 

Let's face it: in the modern era most ""football people"" have a similar knowledge of established players. It's not that big of a deal that Baldini brought in people that everyone knew about. Maybe he has some connections that could give us access to players we normally wouldn't, maybe not. 

For me, however, the strength of the appointment would be in the mutual respect he has with our manager. If AVB specifically wanted this man to be our DoF, I'm glad we're signing him. If it's someone who will work well with the manager and take some of the burden off Levy and AVB I am all for it. The dude isn't going to blow up our club.

It's not a binary--up and downvotes can be reserved for different things that aren't opposites. Even if you want a binary: Upvotes indicate content you want to see. Downvotes indicate content you don't want to see. But by downvoting opinions you disagree with you're saying disagreement=burying that voice. I think we should encourage discussion, and the way to do that is not to try and hide those we disagree with. 

You're not being forced to sift through random comments, I always organize by top (though if I'm curious ill check out controversial).

We should encourage discussion--if you disagree don't upvote, comment if you want, and move on. 

It's perfectly fine for people to disagree and I'm ok with that.

Kolarov for about £10m

Now, I don't care for accumulating imaginary internet points here on Reddit, but heavy downvoting of people's opinions will discourage these users from commenting more often, or giving their own opinion more often. It's not about the points anymore, to newer users here, it's about the fact that their comment is being buried under heaps of comments going 'Xabi pls come back' just because this user tried to rationally argue and discuss tactically against having our dear Xabi back, for example. Like it or not, your downvote tells the user that you don't appreciate his post/dislike his post, and when these downvotes come frequently and in numbers, it's hard for the user not to conform to the mob mentality and post comments that are often well received and in the end stop posting any comments going against the mob mentality altogether.

I don't think anyone enjoys conversing with others who have the exact same opinions, it would be boring and ridiculous. Unfortunately here on Reddit we discourage any opinions differing from the 'general consensus' and that just ends up in everyone repeating the same thing over and over again.

So, in short, your downvote doesn't just affect someone's internet points, it also affects his self-confidence in commenting/posting more often against the hivemind. I mean, we're all wired to enjoy 'popularity', and upvotes give a false impression of that.",0,1370540180,null,0,1370540402,0,cadgrts,t3_1fsl6v,t1_cadgrts,t3_1fsl6v,null,1430903914,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I've never actually met anybody who believes the same things as me, though they doubtless exist.  It's not something I tend to ask people about a lot; belief is a very personal thing.  It's not even really a thing I've thought about logically, though I can come up with semi-logical arguments for it; it's just a thing I ""know"" is true.  There's certain evidence to suggest there are people who innately believe in things, and those who don't no matter how hard they try (and various degrees in between), perhaps I simply fall into the former group.  Maybe if I'd been raised in a religious, rather than atheist/agnostic household, I would have been very religious.

Is some overzealous employee at X ISP going to prevent me from accessing that?

I saw something on TV the other day where people were demanding that software is written to detect porn and other such offensive material automatically. Pretty much they wanted software to look at pictures and determine if they were child porn. What... are you thick? People don't understand the upper and lower boundaries of technology at all. People don't think that they can filter their internet, but it's more than plausible that I can write a program which can enter your dreams and build islands... 

What about small ISPs? (Less common in the UK admittedly, but regardless) They may not be able to provide these services if made compulsory by the gov't and will go under. Making a very unbalanced playing field.

Finally, don't think that this isn't just a ploy. First it's protect the children. Then it's protect the copyright. Then it's [censored]

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"It has been really interesting to read these excerpts (not least because I'm not going to pay for his bloody book - unless he does a Ridsdale and donates the proceeds to charity) and I think that they continue to prove how much of an egotistical prick Warnock is. I mean, in fairness it *is* his book, so he will be talking about his point of view a lot, but his actions and opinions are self-centered.

For example, he continues to blame Tom Lees for the Ipswich game (he remains the only person to do so) and calls out McCormack for daring to discuss his role in the team. Having said that, I am more willing to believe McCormack's interpretation of events, where he went to Warnock about wanting more game time, saying that he's willing to play anywhere and Warnock read more into that than there was and took it as a slight against his authority (which is probably what happened regarding banter with the academy stuff, especially considering that *he* ignored *them* for the most part!). One of the main reasons why I'm more willing to believe McCormack is that he usually calls out people who spread bullshit, as opposed to Warnock who will say anything to make himself look good.

What's worse is that Warnock actually gathered together a group of senior players (you'll notice that they're all 'his men' - he signed them all, with the exception of Brown who is known to have pretty much always been on good terms with Warnock) to talk about McCormack behind his back. This is something that I had assumed was a staple of the Warnock era since McDermott spoke out against that kind of attitude after only a week or two in the job. It's probably why he brought in the likes of Danny Webber during the previous season, so that he had eyes and ears loyal to him in the dressing room. He speaks against a 'them and us' mentality, but I certainly felt that he encouraged such an attitude with the way he only ever praised his signings and favourite players - and only ever blamed players he didn't sign or bring through.

Also, I like the element of hypocrisy (it's not a Neil Warnock team without plenty of hypocritical statements from the 'Gaffer' himself) within his own book. He speaks about the transfer situation with Becchio (side note: I still think that he drove Becchio away because he was constantly critical of him throughout the season, while forcing him to work harder than ever at chasing punts up field due to his insane tactics, despite claiming in the book that he had a great season up to that point) and how he couldn't blacken his character because it would reduce his value, yet during his post-match interview after the Barnsley game he announced that he believed Becchio's head had been turned.

Moreover, my understanding is that Becchio didn't rigidly want to go to Turkey or China. He wanted an increase in his wages, because he was set for his last big contract, but his preference was to stay at Leeds, with his secondary preference being to stay in England. He didn't want to move abroad, that is why he came across as so humble and grateful after signing for Norwich.

true,thatstevelord,null,null,"&gt; We’ve already secured partnerships with major industry players, received great press coverage and have the backing of an awesome group of investors with successes like Betfair, Zoopla and Gumtree under their belts.

Yet despite having investor backing can't afford to pay more than minimum wage? Smells funny to me.

&gt; We structure the internship so that we can get the right candidate clued up as quickly as possible, and moved into a permanent paid position at the end of the 8 weeks.

As someone who's run two startups I'm calling BS on everything you're saying. If you don't have time to get an intern up to speed on the job you need an experienced hire, not an intern. One of my companies just postponed their internship programme for a year because we took on full time permanent grads and couldn't spare the resources to take interns on as well. Both were paid graduate starting salaries of £22k and that was working from home. Students have a rough enough deal as it is, paying them NMW isn't helping at all, especially in London.

Secondly, if you're looking to take on graduates it's not an internship it's a job and probation period. Pay them a proper wage and stop trying to dress it up as something it's not.

Thirdly if there's a permanent position at the end of 8 weeks and you can't afford to pay someone a decent salary for two months then it looks like either you haven't got the cash flow to pay two month's salary for the intern(s) or you're looking to take a bunch of people on for two months and fire the ones that don't make the cut.

&gt;**60% of male college students “indicated some likelihood of raping or using force in certain circumstances.**”

&gt;Men in fraternities appear to engage in more non-physical coercion and use of drugs and alcohol as a sexual strategy than do independents.

&gt;Every 21 hours there is another rape on an American college campus.

&gt;90% of all campus rapes occur under the influence of alcohol.

&gt;Men are more likely than women to assume that a woman who drinks alcohol on a date is a willing sex partner. 40% of men who think this way also believe it is acceptable to force sex on an intoxicated woman.

&gt;Alcohol use at the time of the attack was found to be one of the four strongest predictors of a college woman being raped.

&gt;**43% of college men admit using coercive behavior to have sex, including ignoring a woman’s protest; using physical aggression; and forcing intercourse; 15% acknowledged they had committed acquaintance rape; 11% acknowledged using physical restraint to force a woman to have sex**.

&gt;College rape victims receive external physical injuries in over 47% of all rapes.

&gt;Of the college woman who are raped, only 25% describe it as rape.

&gt;Of the college women who are raped, only 10% report the rape.

&gt;College women are most vulnerable to rape during the first few weeks of the freshman and sophomore years.

&gt;**One in twelve college-age men admit having fulfilled the prevailing definition of rape or attempted rape, yet virtually none of these men identify themselves as rapists.**

&gt;34% of completed rapes and 45% of attempted rapes take place on campus. Almost 60% of the completed campus rapes that take place on campus occur in the victim's residence, 31% occur in another residence, and 10% occur in a fraternity.

&gt;3/4 of off-campus rapes and 7/8 of on-campus rapes involved perpetrators who were known to the victims.

&gt;**78% of the men identified (as rapists) were an acquaintance, friend or boyfriend of the victims.**

&gt;Most rapes occur on the weekend.

there's also been a boatload of studies that support the idea that male rapists think that all other men are rapists too, and that they just keep quiet about it. Telling rape jokes enforces rape culture and it makes rapists feel like what they're doing is acceptable.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"I don't have any particular feelings towards this rumour - be it like or dislike. I just find it highly speculative. 

It is not that _I_ don't trust goal.com. You will find many Internet fora where particular sources are discouraged due to the likelihood of their veracity being close to chance. Sources like a major national broadsheet (historically speaking) or the Echo have a generally better reliability and their rumours are more likely to be based on genuine developments, as opposed to sheer fantasy; something both goal.com and caughtoffside are repeatedly being accused of. 

It is because of this I don't find this particular rumour warrants, for the time being, broader acknowledgement. Sure, Tevez is a skilled player. So is Cavani and so is Jovetic. But nothing, bar a torrent of speculation from unreliable sources, suggests that any of these are likely targets and hence I do not see the point of debating daydreams. 

Tevez is 29 - i.e. at his most expensive. His resale value will fall sharply in the next two years. There is nothing in his history that would suggest he wouldn't command, for us, astronomical wages. He has repeatedly stated his distaste for the region he lives in. In other words, as far as I can see, I cannot see him as being a target for us based on our general recruitment policy and I cannot see him signing for a club where he would _a)_ have no immediate prospects of Champions League football and _b)_ have to take a significant pay cut.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;60% of male college students “indicated some likelihood of raping or using force in certain circumstances.”

What does that even mean? I'd like to see the question.

&gt;15% acknowledged they had committed acquaintance rape

As in, raped a friend? I honestly kind of don't believe that, although the US is a different animal to the UK, there is *no way* that 15% of male uni students are rapists.

&gt;Of the college woman who are raped, only 25% describe it as rape.

This is interesting. The common definition of rape includes sex while drunk, which is pretty fucking dumb. Now I'm kinda dubious about the whole study, if it's subscribing to that ideology.

&gt;One in twelve college-age men admit having fulfilled the prevailing definition of rape or attempted rape, yet virtually none of these men identify themselves as rapists.

And so now given the above I'd take this as meaning ""one in twelve college age men admit having had sex with a woman who was drunk"" - sorry, but that's not enough to call the act rape. Having sex with a woman (or man) who doesn't want you to have sex with her is rape.

What's interesting here with this study is that they're saying ""most rapists don't think they're rapists"" and the justification for that is clearly that the people who made the study are using a definition of rape which only a minority of people would accept as reasonable.

&gt;Telling rape jokes enforces rape culture

Here's the applicable part:

Two types of dependent variables 
were analyzed in this study. The first 
pertained to respondents' self- 
perceived likelihood that they would, in 
the future, engage in sexually coercive 
behavior under no-penalty conditions. 
The second type of dependent variable 
pertained to respondents' reports of 
their actual previous use of various 
types of sexually coercive behavior. 
Two questions measuring self- 
reported likelihood of engaging in sex- 
ual coercion, adapted from Malamuth's 
(1989a, 1989b) attraction to sexual ag- 
gression scale, were included. A 
rape/force scale, from which these two 
likelihood measures were derived, was 
assessed for reliability and validity by 
Malamuth (1989a, 1989b) using 
measures of internal consistency, test- 
retest reliability, and discriminant and 
construct validity. The two items in the 
present study were introduced with the 
following statement: **""If you could be 
assured that you could in no way be 
punished for engaging in the following 
acts, how likely, if at all, would you be 
to engage in such acts?"" The two items 
of interest are: (1) ""forcing a female to 
do something sexual she didn't want to 
do,"" and (2) ""rape.""** These are referred 
to respectively as self-perceived ""likeli- 
hood of using force to gain sexual ac- 
cess"" and ""likelihood of committing 
rape."" Just as was true for the two-item 
scale of reinforcement balance for 
these acts, the perceived likelihood of 
engaging in one act was sufficiently 
correlated with the perceived likeli- 
hood of the other that they form an ac- 
ceptable scale of ""likelihood of using 
force and/or committing rape"" (Cron- 
bach's al pha = .69). 
This scalability is to be expected 
since, in legal, moral, and behavioral 
terms, forcing a female to have sex and 
rape describe essentially the same act. 
However, respondents apparently per- 
ceive them as different acts, since they 
report likelihood of the former more 
frequently than the latter. Therefore, to 
check to see if they relate to the social 
learning model in different ways, each 
was used as a single-item measure of 
separate dependent variables, in addi- 
tion to being combined into a scale. 
Five response alternatives ranging 
f rom very unlikely (coded 1) to very like- 
/y (coded 5) were presented to respon- 
dents. 
Three sets of questions measur- 
ing the extent to which the respondent 
had actually engaged in acts of coer- 
cive sexuality were adapted from Koss 
and Oros (1982). Respondents were 
asked to indicate the number of times 
they had ever ""experienced"" engaging 
in a series of sexually coercive acts. 
These behaviors are listed in Appendix 
B. Response alternatives were: 1 = 
never; 2 = once or twice; 3 = three to 
five times; 4 = six to ten times; 5 = 
more than ten times. Individual items 
were combined to form three depen- 
dent variables: extent to which respon- 
dent had: (1) used nonviolent force to 
obtain sexual acts (three items); (2) 
used drugs and alcohol as a sexual 
coercion strategy (one-item scale, 
Cronbach's alpha = .55); and (3) used 
physical force to obtain sexual inter- 
course (four-item scale, Cronbach's 
alpha = .86). Koss and Gidycz (1985) 
also found the sexual experiences in- 
strument from which the measures 
used here were derived to be reliable 
on tests of internal consistency and 
test-retest reliability.

&gt;As in, raped a friend? I honestly kind of don't believe that, although the US is a different animal to the UK, there is no way that 15% of male uni students are rapists.

The sample size was 6,159 college students enrolled at 32 institutions in the US.

http://www.uic.edu/depts/owa/sa_rape_support.html

In a survey of male college students:

* 35% anonymously admitted that, under certain circumstances, they would commit rape if they believed they could get away with it

* One in 12 admitted to committing acts that met **the legal definitions of rape,** and 84% of men who committed rape did not label it as rape.

&gt;This is interesting. The common definition of rape includes sex while drunk, which is pretty fucking dumb. Now I'm kinda dubious about the whole study, if it's subscribing to that ideology.

Bit of a leap in logic there, the studies use the legal definition of rape, and define rape as acts which meet that legal definition.

&gt;And so now given the above I'd take this as meaning ""one in twelve college age men admit having had sex with a woman who was drunk"" - sorry, but that's not enough to call the act rape. Having sex with a woman (or man) who doesn't want you to have sex with her is rape.

Again, you're basing this off conclusions you've made without even reading the study, it's about meeting the legal definitions of rape.

&gt;Wot culture?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture

&gt;I think it's safe to say that men who hold down their friends or strangers and forcibly have sex with them know what they're doing is sick and wrong.

That's not what these studies say. A lot of rapists think the behaviour is normal because certain aspects of society normalize this behaviour (see UniLad and LadBible advocating for raping women)

If you were to say, go to google (at 8.8.8.8) and ask them REALLY nicely for the address of naughtyporn.com they would oblige without an issue.

So this works perfectly for the average household that still relies on their isp to provide them with DNS records, but anyone that uses any DNS server outside of that range, will bypass the filtering completely.

true,Tin_Feuler,,Carrickfergus,"I've spent the last few minutes racking my brain trying to come up with something similar to it that I experienced in the US. This is not precisely the same because there hasn't been anywhere near the same amount of violence in the US over this as there has been between catholics/ protestants in NI but here goes:


Think about the threads you see on reddit or elsewhere when you see people arguing about republicans/democrats - it can get pretty venomous and petty. That's what you see on our threads. Our arguments and disagreements are not very different to yours and truthfully all the trouble you heard of in NI has probably had more to do with politics than religion. Very few of these people on the news actually go to church.


In terms of how strange it is that something like this seems to affect everyday life, well I would liken it to the stories we see here on reddit about non-religious people being treated differently or even persecuted by the religious community in various ways. (Whether these stories are true or not I don't really know so please don't mistake this as a jibe or criticism of the US.) This does not happen where we are from. Most people are disinterested in the whole religion discussion (ignoring the protestant/ catholic part haha) and couldn't care less if you believed in God or not. Even if it was someone who genuinely cared they're more likely to go and quietly pray for you somewhere than openly say anything or slash your tyres at night. You're very unlikely to be excommunicated from your household and certainly not your entire community. (chances are you don't even tell your parents because it just seems like such an odd thing to take seriously - unlike the many posts we see on reddit with people struggling to 'come out' to friends and family). The idea of belief mattering that much is completely alien to us and generally we can't believe it seems to be so pervasive in (significant parts) of American society. 


*Hopefully* you are at this stage thinking ""Wow, calm down. It's *really* not that bad where I'm from"". Well congrats! Same for us! It really is nowhere near as bad as you probably imagine it to be! But, you can see how forming an opinion of what some people say online might make it *seem* that way.

That is a very, very difficult stance to defend, and I simply don't think you did it well enough.  That is a very valid opinion, that he could've hurt his value and probably did to some degree, but you took it three steps further by insisting he did, did so by a lot, and that there was only one way to restore his real value.

Well, tough, either pay people to work for you, offer proper apprenticeships where you actually learn real skills, or face the consequences that people might not think you're lovely company number 1.

Honestly, the idea that you should be allowed to hush up wrongdoing, because the wrongdoing might make you look, well, wrong, is a pretty poor argument to use in court.

Again, I've got no problem with real apprenticeships where you learn a trade or skill over months, however, the facts of workfare are you get training for maybe half an hour on which end of the mop to hold or which way up the cans of beans are meant to sit on the shelves, and then the rest of the six weeks is doing donkey work, that you're effectively stealing from the regular staff, who'd be getting paid for that work if you weren't there.",0,1370546470,null,0,false,0,cadjax2,t3_1eone0,t1_cadjax2,t3_1eone0,null,1430902649,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

did you read the entire thread? I linked at least a half-dozen, and also cases of where the phenomenon is casually referenced to he point where it doesn't need to be backed up, and also a 350-page economic report into transfers

the only counterpoint was Ronaldo - a case where Manchester United filed a formal complaint to FIFA, which still hasn't been settled, because they feel they were cheated on the transfer since Ronaldo had been tapped up. That one discredited example became 'examples' then became 'you have nothing while he has dozens of examples'.

saying that Suarez reduced his value because he spoke out about wanting to leave is the commonly accepted viewpoint in football, only in this sub would be burden of proof be on me (and an excessive burden) rather than the guy who said his value didn't reduce.

not only is it commonly accepted in football, it is economics 101 (do you pay more for something that a seller wants to or has to sell, or for something he does't want to or have to sell?)

&gt;  often take an absolutist stance, which then increases your burden of proof greatly and thus make your comments much less defensible.

that is because I believe what I say. I'm not going to sit on the fence and compromise my opinion just to make others here happy and more comfotable. 

It is a lot easier to be soft on things and agree with everyone, its a lot harder to call out bullshit and to put up with the mob (especially when it is something as stupid as someone saying that Suarez didn't decrease his value and a dozen people not just agreeing with it, but defending it vigorously - not with facts, but with insults)

Ignoring the political side, if you had 120-150 individuals who have hired a hotel for a couple of days and are being targeted by protesters (some groups which are known for having violent members) then you would expect that the police attend and keep the peace.

It doesn't matter if it's the Bilderberg meeting or a mothers against cancer meeting, policing should be as unpolitical as possible otherwise you get what is happening in the article above, The moment you start bring politics into policing you start destroying trust.


I may not agree with 120 odd of the most influential people meeting in secret, but theres nothing illegal about meeting and talking and it is the protesters right to organize protests against them meeting, but don't shove the blame onto the protesters for causing the costs or the Bilderberg for simply meeting up.

Actually, it is abusing me, because 1. what I posted didn't violate the rules, 2. the rules are dumb, and 3. the rules are not uniformly enforced.

&gt; For those following along at home, /u/sirbruce is bitter that we removed his post with pictures about the Doctor Who stamps that he finally received, because 1. they had been posted about frequently and everyone already knew about them

This is a lie.  One only need refer to the link: http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/search?q=stamps&amp;restrict_sr=on

The person holding the stamp booklet was from *22 days before* and doesn't show the actual stamps.  Most of the posts *were from 3 months before*, and the more recent ones seemed to just be people talking about the stamps.  And they received so few upvotes that they are very easy to miss.  Picutres of the stamp booklet were not ""posted about frequently"".

&gt; and 2. it was a ""look what I got"" post, and then removed his ""I'm taking my toys and going home"" post for content not appropriate for /r/DoctorWho.

This is lie #2, since the rules specifically state:

&gt; These are allowed on a case-by-case basis if the merchandise is particularly appealing to the audience.

The post had over 500 upvotes; I think it was merchandise ""particularly appealing to the audience"".  Note that this rule was changed AFTER MY POST to the following:

&gt; Merchandise is allowed in extenuating circumstances, depending on the interest of the item.

Again, I'd say 500 upvotes qualifies as interest.

&gt; You'll notice that he never actually followed through with his threat to leave - he just wanted to make a loud noise and get attention for his perceived abuses at our hands.

This is lie #3 -- you'll note that I did leave and have made only a handful of posts here since, nothing at all compared to the multiple posts and content submissions I used to give to the community.

&gt; In over 9 months, those are the only posts that he has ever had removed.

Exposing children to porn on purpose is child abuse, so surely this - the opposite - is a good thing. I actually can't believe how many people here are arguing against a child safety measure.

First, it is true that there are lots of detail, procedure, missing from each of the exhibits. If I'd included as much detail as my husband gave me, I'd never have finished writing them, no one would have read them and they would have been impenetrable to non-lawyers. I set myself a (fairly) strict 1500 word limit for each as a result. Enough to give a flavour of what went on and an example of how law abiding people can end up on the wrong side of the law and in need of legal aid. 

The other reason for lack of some details is to make quite sure they were anonymous. All of these cases are a matter of public record, that is what happens when you get charged with a crime. That said, even if you knew my husband's name you'd still have a job finding these people. You'd have to search records for each crown court across England and Wales going back many years and even then you would only find R vs exhibit A.

It was the 25th of March, 2011. I needed to carry a box of papers to the office upstairs, little did I know of the distress this would cause me.

Once I had ascended the stairs I was met with a set of doors. As an independent womyn this posed no problem, but before I was able to get through them a male pig dashed in front of me and swang the door open. As I was perfectly capable of looking after myself I informed this pig that I did not need his assistance. But that was just the beginning of what was a truly traumatising incident. Instead of respecting my rights he decided to make a sarcastic comment and laugh in my face. This was a blatant attempt to dis-empower women and humiliate me in front of my peers.

I immediately reported this to Human Resources and they took the appropriate disciplinary proceedings.

The photos were demanded for *weeks*. There were court orders where the judge demanded they were produced. It didn't happen. Faced with that situation, the only course is to turn up on the appointed trial day - not turning up is not an option! It is not unusual for the CPS to only produce evidence on the day. Happens all the time. The CPS barrister had only been instructed the day before again, that happens all the time. 

Regarding the use of experts. Experts cost money. Usually you don't need an expert to tell you what you can see with your own eyes. The CPS didn't have an expert either. There was no doubt that the photos had come from his computer. No question of any internet downloading. They weren't deleted or hidden files, often experts are needed for these. Or for ones where there might be a virus downloading nasty stuff without the owner's knowledge. Only time you might need an expert in such a situation is when the two sides can't agree on which category a photo falls into. Usually they can agree, so no need for an expert.

Now, there are three or four other cases that my husband dealt with on this subject, where the defendants were acquitted. They got very technical, with multiple experts, data logs and all sorts.

She's done the most bizarre thing I've ever seen with a fringe cut, given that I've got really thin hair. She's feathered it throughout (theoretically good), but rather than it being asymmetrical (which is what I asked for), she's done some bloody mental thing whereby if you comb it straight down (which I would never do), it's longer in the centre and shorter either side. So when combed down as a traditional fringe it looks like really weird, uneven daggers. 

Who the chuff has a fringe that dips into a V point in the centre, besides vampires?

It's really weird, and I can't even begin to think wtf her logic was with that.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"I honestly think that Heitinga is best kept at the club. I highly doubt he will command anywhere near the price we would have got for him a year ago, making it probably worth keeping him for another year to gauge how he fits into the Martinez system. 

With 2 CB's alongside him I feel his positional brain (which he still possesses, despite other areas falling significantly) will be an asset in the more advances position of 'blocker' CB, which Martinez has shown a liking for. 

That being said, we do still need (at least) another centre back. Jags is the rock, and Distin still has it- but lets face it, he is a player who relies on his physical gifts of speed and power, and at his age these are not going to last.

I feel we are in a good position to sign a young player, perhaps from a lower league team or abroad, give him a year of rotation with Distin with the hope of him taking over in 2014. 

For this I think Grant Hanley is a perfect option: He is young, big, physical, and improving consistently; not only that, he is not going to want to be stuck in the Championship for another season, so we may be able to get him a bit cheaper than we otherwise would have. 

Also, we are in dire need of a consistant forward who scores goals. For this we could gamble- go on the budget side and hope for the best, but this is so hit and miss and could end up being the difference between being a bottom half club and fighting for top 6 places.

Whilst glamorous options are available from Spain (Negrado for example), lets be real... We just don't have what is needed to attract players like that. Arouna Kone (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread) would be a great pickup, as he is exactly what we need, and most likely willing to follow his manager across to us.

---

Those  2 would be my top 'realistic' wishlist players, but in reality we are going to need far more than that:

In an ideal world we are able to offload Fellaini in the summer for a healthy fee. Although I love the guy, and would like to see him stay, I feel that it is the right time to say goodbye. Because of his fantastic season, and the lack of genuine world class defensive midfielders on the market at the moment he is going to command a price far in excess of what he is worth.

As long as there is a plan to replace him I don't mind seeing him go... But the plan is the problematic part. It seems we dodged a bullet with Leroy Fer who has been laughably awful ever since January so he is out of contention, but who else is there to go for?

There are far worse option in my opinion than James McCarthy- Wigan need to offload players so surely we are going to be the most favorable side for him to move to. Whilst he is not a direct replacement for Fellaini by any means, he does fill a gap and has shown his proficiency in the Martinez system...I have a feeling him along-side Gibbo and Osman, flanked by Mary and Pienaar with Kone up top would be hugely effective. 

Adam Lallana is another thought, or maybe Nainggolan if we want more aggression... He is a tough player to replace, but it all depends on Martinez's vision for the club as to who we choose.  

---

We also need a keeper. Howard is not the player he was (although he has been excellent the last few months) and Mucha is out- for me Guzan would be a perfect fit. Commanding, confident and proven as well as being the full time successor to Howard's Number 1 spot for USA (Marketing dolla dolla bills yo). 

But probably expensive.

Sean Johnson would be cheaper, is American and apparently very talented- I have no seen him play though so that might all be PR. If the price was right though (for some perspective Guzan went to Villa for under 1m dollars) he could come in and act as an understudy to Howard- we could test him out in the cup, give him the gloves for the occasional League game and if he performs we have just struck gold, and if he doesn't- it was not a particularly expensive lesson.

Yeah, you're right about dems/reps -- it does get pretty vitriolic online but obviously in most situations, people  know better than to bring up politics, unless they're sloshed enough at Thanksgiving to finally let loose on Reagan-loving Uncle Phil. And of course, it's always good to remember that people will always dish it out more online than they do in person. 

And yes, it's true there are some cultish religious communities/families in the USA that are obviously very biased against disbelievers and will shun their families if they ~stray from the flock~ or whatever, but the great majority of people aren't really that religious here and really only about a quarter of the population attend church on a regular basis. I grew up in a conservative rural midwest town in a county neighboring Michele Bachmann's district, and still nobody gave a sneeze when I declared my agnosticism. Really, it's usually the ones that were hurt the worst that protest the loudest and write up horror stories on r/atheism. The most uh...for lack of a better term, evangelical of atheists I've known are the ones who experienced their families being torn apart due to religious beliefs, but they're actually pretty small in number. Most people don't really talk religion here either unless they're in the context of a religious setting. I can't actually remember the last time anybody ever asked me about my beliefs or lack thereof, haha.

I wonder if it might be sensible if I thought of the imagery/labels of the differing sides of more like symbols of perspective, instead of actually representing the actual religions and associated countries, if that makes sense. Maybe that might seem dismissive to someone who feels strongly allied with one side or the other, but it seems sort of apt from what I've heard. That's sort of how most Americans think of the confederate flag which is sometimes flown in the south -- a symbol of a perspective/lifestyle/attitude rather than actually representing the Confederacy. Not to say that some of them wouldn't love to see the US split again, heh.

true,barristerswife,null,null,"There was no prosecution expert, just a police officer refusing / unable to respond to request to provide access to the photos (this normally happens at the police station, so that there is no sending of the photos around via email etc.) due to being short staffed.

If you want to get an expert you have to apply to the Legal Aid Agency for funding. First thing they will ask is ""have you seen the photos"". Because they are going to pay for it, they need justification that an expert is actually required.

Also, it is up to the solicitor to actually get hold of the expert. The barrister just advises that that is what they need to do. 

There would have been nothing for an expert to do in this case. It would have been a waste of money.

If the police had shown the guy the photos during his interview it wouldn't have gone any further, because he would have told them the story, they could have checked it out and found it was all above board. But they didn't want to put the laptop in front of him, presumably,  in case he did something to it to try and destroy the evidence. Print copies of photos might have been more likely to be put in front of him, I'm not sure.

Does that make it any clearer?!

And there was this huge discussion on /r/gallifrey 6 days ago (and some more after that): http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1fd4wu/if_the_doctor_were_to_regenerate_into_a_female/

I'll copy past my post from there:

I've written about this before soooo....

I would be for a female Doctor (I've seen it done before, it's cool). Since Doctor Who is a show that rewrites itself you can do whatever. I'd point out the Corsair thing and River changing race.

For arguments against...

The Doctor has been **white male for 11 incarnations** and some people would feel it odd if he changed. It would be odd but I don't think that's a reason against it. Doctor Who has survived by the long cherished method of ""making stuff up as we go along"". It has no problem bringing in new/weird things or outright contradictions. For example, we had no idea he could regenerate for the first three years of the tv show. How radical would it be to change out the main cast member around whom all the mystery was centered? Yet they changed Hartnell into Troughton. Are we now saying that gender is such a big obstacle that it trumps changing main cast characters?

If we did get a female companion, in the long run years from now, fans of the future would understand exactly why the Doctor was white male for 11 incarnations and then suddenly female: It's the time period. The early 21st century/mid 20th century. The idea of transgenderism (as the Doctor's regeneration could be seen as) is pretty controversial and not widely accepted in today's society.

**Some people feel that gender is a very important part of the character** and believe that gender is one of the fixed aspects of society/their world and that it should not be tampered with (which is also partly why transgenderism is controversial). Personally I feel that gender is useless unless used in a binary (two options: male or female) way. If gender stopped being binary there would be no point in using it as a way to define people and the pressure of comments like ""because you're X gender you should like pink/blue"" would not be a thing. Gender needs to stop restricting people.

Also I feel that the Doctor is not particularly masculine or feminine in a traditional sense. He's not athletic, impulsively aggressive, domineering. He's emotional, sensitive and intelligent. Things that all people can be (and should be imo; even if society goes around telling men they aren't allowed to cry). Including core traits like  intelligence and sensitivity is the Doctor's eccentricity and optimism. These traits are (imo) essential to the character of the Doctor but they are not male-exclusive traits.

**People don't want the character to be a gimmick**, which is a fair concern. Doing a gender swap is a big move and a real minefield. We don't want the Doctor to be making a joke out of being female but also don't want it to be ignored. This one is all up to whether or not you trust the writers to do a good job. I don't know if I do.

Plus, **would anyone buy it**? I have a feeling that the casual audience would flip the heck out. People might cite this time period as the time when Doctor Who finally jumps the shark. There would be backlash. There would be people just *waiting* to see sexism where there is none (or maybe the writers suck at their jobs). It's a minefield.

**The Doctor's relationships** is another concern. What would happen between he and River? How would the companion dynamic change? Well it'd sure be something interesting to explore, that's all I can say. River Song is bisexual so a female Doctor wouldn't be an issue for her. Though you *can* have a romantic relationship without having a sexual one (it's called asexual romanticism as opposed to aromantic asexuality).

**Historical concern** is an issue. The Doctor would be at a disadvantage if she ever visited time periods on Earth (even today in some places) where women are treated poorly (um like all the time periods lol). It's like the crap Martha took as the Doctor took her to past time periods. It would be interesting. It might or might not be addressed. For one thing, sexism towards women in the past wouldn't be an issue if all the Earth stories we wrote about weren't set in European or post-European-contact societies or other societies that treat women as lessers. Also, how big of an issue has being female been for the Doctor's companions who go to past time periods? Not too much. The show glosses that stuff over or it gets a random comment somewhere. If the Doctor was non-white, he (or she) might end up avoiding time periods hostile to them. The current Doctor does this. Has the Doctor ever visited feudal Japan or ancient China?

**In spite of all of this** I would still be interested and would still give it a shot. Plus, there is a spin-off media character called **Iris Wildthyme** who travels through space and time in a red double decker bus that's smaller on the inside armed only with her intelligence and handy sonic corkscrew. She's a batty crazy older woman who likes to drink and has adventures. She's met the Doctor in alt. media and often her stories are parodies of his. In a meta sort of way, Iris seems to think she's had the same experiences as the Doctor (as if she is him) but she also knows her life is a parody of his. She comes from the Clockworks people (code for Time Lords) and is possibly from the Obverse (whatever that is). She's pretty much a female Doctor and great. All her stories are intentionally campy funny and fun but still maintain good writing. Iris is an awesome character and I encourage people to try out a story of hers to get an idea of a female Doctor. Plus she's played by **Katy Manning**, the actress who played Jo Grant, 3rd Doctor companion.

So there are a lot of concerns for a gender (or race) change and I've addressed the main ones here. In the end, some things would change and some things would be addressed. Change is good, addressing is good. Going new places is good. Not screwing up the show with bad writing is also good.",0,1370553506,null,0,false,0,cadm5ye,t3_1ft884,t1_cadm5ye,t3_1ft884,null,1430901300,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I wouldn't, I'd take the script and adapt it to today. Instead of whatever allegedly guilty party was involved in the original film (a few petty criminals?) I'd have a prominent MP who's been found to swindle 50k in expenses or the Director General of the BBC (Savilesgate) up there instead. It would be 8 angry men, 3 women and one undecided. One of them would probably be Polish too, and we'd definitely see some non-white people.

&gt;It has to do with, if you want quality content here from me, then you need to get the mods to change their stance vis-a-vis me.

Well isn't that just the most selfish thing I've heard from you all day. I need to get every one of the mods to change the subreddit rules that 150k *other* people have no problem with, just so that *you* post an image that you claim to have, because you are *so fucking important* that you get to dictate policy on the subreddit. Because really, all your twelve year old ""I have it but I'm not sharing"" talk is only making me want to punch you in the mouth. If you have a problem with the moderators and nobody else does, leave, and we can enjoy ourselves in peace and not have to deal with your incessant bullshit.

I think that's the key to how our transfer window will go down. I think if we keep the 4-5-1 a box to box player like Fer would be ideal but if we play a 3-5-2 (or 5-3-2 depending on how you look at it) a defensive midfielder who can break things up is key who can then let Gibbo pull the strings from deep.

Obviously we'd all love the dead wood to be cleared like Naismith and Gueye but finding takers is gonna be hard. Jonny H looks set to leave so another young CB is key. Maybe De Vrij or Martins Indi at Feyenoord could fit the bill if available.

A keeper would also be needed as Super Jan's had enough of the bench so maybe a Howard replacement rather than another back up. Butland would have been nice but who knows how he'll turn out.

Also personally I hope we keep Jellyfish for another year. Hopefully it's just been an incredibly shitty year for him and he can go back to his one touch finishes again.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"The 5 year element of those terms went away very quickly on a tide of rumour mill mumbo jumbo but the loan demand has stayed. It was likely a ploy by his agents to force action. Tbh I don' trust KDB's agents but he is by far their most valuable player so I don't blame them. KDB will almost certainly have appearances clauses for Chelsea appearances causing a windfall for his former club and possibly a portion of this will be marked for the Agents. Equally, this may have a timeout clause. Hence they want their money. This is not unusual for players who you think have great potential.

It has also been frequently mentioned that a deal has been made for his loan agreement. All of this is subject to Chelsea agreement. The transfer of course is likely to need a fee of around £15-25 million. Something which Dortmund can not really afford. Eriksen ought to be more affordable. Bearing in mind that the sale of Gotze was in part to fund more financially rewarding contracts for other players so that they could keep hold of them.

De Bruyne's representatives initially said he would prefer Dortmund to Bayern Leverkusen upon it being requested by Leverkusen as part of the Shurrle deal but given their little difference in the table this is likely down to him prefering the Dortmund style of play and feeling that they will make him into a better ""star"" player. The transfer deal spawned out of this.

And indeed I refer you to this post by one of our faithful blogs:
http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2013/5/13/4327812/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-kevin-de-bruyne-borussia-dortmund

Cause for concern (as presumably intended) yes, will it actually be bad for us? Unlikely, Hummels, Subotic, Gundogan, Reus, Lew. Any one of those players would have added something (Reus=Shurrle) whereas KDB adds little but depth. If this was the case and we were to sell him then there would be more substantial rumours of us getting someone else in.

A loan deal makes the most sense for both clubs and the player.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; Here and here are some historical reasons why that's bullshit.

Unfortunately, the community of /r/doctorwho is not the same as those.  They've already proven so by not defending me when the persecution began.

&gt; By following the rules to the subreddit they moderate. Right. (link to the mod's comment)

The mod was wrong and a proven liar. ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1fr3n8/can_anyone_find_a_wallpaper_version_of_this_image/cadkec2) to my comment)

&gt; Seems as if you're the only one that's finding this to be a problem at the moment

Seems to me I'm the only one NOT finding this to be a problem at the moment.  I told the OP that the mods prevent me from helping them; a bunch of other people seem to have a problem with me not helping.  In that case, you have a problem with the mods, so get the mods to change, and then I'll be happy to help.

&gt; If it wasn't personal, you wouldn't still be here.

Incorrect; I engage on many topics that are not personal.  I'm still here because you and others keep responding to my posts, for example.

&gt; Well isn't that just the most selfish thing I've heard from you all day. I need to get every one of the mods to change the subreddit rules that 150k other people have no problem with, just so that you post an image that you claim to have, because you are so fucking important that you get to dictate policy on the subreddit.

It's not simply the image, but the vast majority of other content that I have contributed which the mods do not think outweigh any personal issues they have against me.

&gt; Because really, all your twelve year old ""I have it but I'm not sharing"" talk is only making me want to punch you in the mouth.

Threats of violence are pretty offensive, but I doubt any mod will enforce that rule against you.

&gt; If you have a problem with the moderators and nobody else does, leave, and we can enjoy ourselves in peace and not have to deal with your incessant bullshit. 

No bullshit, and I did leave.  I simply commented on this person's post so they know why they can't get the content they would like, because of the moderators.  If ""nobody"" has a problem with the moderators, then you should be happy to accept the reason that you don't get the content you desire from me.  Why are you causing a fuss?

Show me a chav that was educated at a public or even a private school. Show me a chav that can trace their ancestry back to the Normans.

It's not forcing a class issue if it is already a class issue and was from the beginning. The chav classification, the wringing of hands about the underclass, the talk of ""strivers"" and ""skivers"" is all part of an agenda that came about during the Victorian Era when rural populations relocated en masse to the cities to work in the factories.

Vertical cohesion and identification was necessary to keep society together and thus you had the idea of the respectable and not respectable working class. The ""undeserving"" would be recognisable to us today as ""chavs.""

Vellios is an odd one, it is impossible to judge how he has improved because of his lack of chances in the team, but he has shown himself to be a pretty versatile target man when he came on early in the season in the dying moments of the same.

Still debatable. He was very confused about who he was at that point due to amnesia.

I think regeneration into other species is not typical though and usually actually just a regeneration gone really wrong. I mean, would they still be able to regenerate as a different species? If they're not a Timelord anymore, then they wouldn't be able to regenerate. So for this reason alone regeneration into a different species wouldn't happen.

Also, additional source is Parting of the Ways. 9 calls the process ""dodgy"" (probably meaning things go wrong sometimes, not like they're supposed to) and gives an example such as : ""me with no head!""

Few years ago i start following Champions league. And fell in luv with real Madrid. I'v always been a soccer player fan, not a club... And boy did I love roberto carlos. But I never really got into it like i'm now with tottenham. 

Than suddenly, 2 years ago I was watching spurs vs inter. And to be honest... I had no idea what spurs where. The only clubs i knew where ManU, $chea, arsenal.

I'm from Belgium you know and if you don't really follow BPL it is only the big clubs you know by name and by game.

I remember sitting in my local youth house (I have no idea how to say this in English, but apparently this does not exist in other counties.) and they showed all CL matches on the big screen. 

I was playing poker and watched the game with 1 eye. I felt sorry for spurs, not knowing who they were, but i thought they deserved better.
Than suddenly this guy ""Gareth Bale"" seemed to have enough humiliation and desided to go on a rampage. After that game i just wanted to see more of this guy. He stole my heart. And ever since I'm a spurs fan.
They decided to buy SuperJan and Dembélé which made my world rock. Now luv the team, luv the players and soo luv having 2 Belgian players play their asses of for this superB team.

Of all the teams I have seen in my entire life... I must say this club feels like the most honest to me. 5th place... Doesn't matter. I feel so much love between the players that you can not do anything else but love them.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Not really, it says more about institutionalised sexism and rape culture. Kind of like how 'raping' the test means you actually did well on it, or how you 'totally raped that guy' when playing online. Rape is trivialized in the media and in aspects of society, especially online.

Stuff like the rape-sloth meme:

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rape-sloth

which makes *hilarious* jokes about raping women, because apparently forcing a woman to have sex with you against her will is funny, right?

Society has turned sex away from intimacy and towards possession, and women are fed messages of 'being a slut' if they have sex, and being a 'prude' if they don't. There's a massive stigma against rape victims which includes victim-blaming and slut-shaming, and women are often made to feel bad for not having sex with someone, which can often lead to feelings of confusion and shame about whether or not they were actually raped.

A example of this is marital rape, if a husband rapes his wife, he isn't exempt from prosecution for rape because his marital status does not give him constant consent. This was only changed here in the UK with the abolishing of the marital rape exemption in 1991. If a woman was raped by her husband in the 1960s, and then said she wasn't raped because society at the time thought that she wasn't, that doesn't alter the fact that she was raped by her husband. Whether or not she thinks or wants to accept that she was the victim of that crime doesn't change the fact that she was. The mugging example is a parallel, but it's flawed, and I often see it toted out when talking about rape, usually about how women who wear short dresses are 'asking to get raped', much like someone with a wallet out is 'asking to get mugged,' but that's a whole different issue. 

If a strong man in a nice suit comes up to you in the street and shakes your hand, smiling and being pleasant, and then whilst doing this takes your phone and tells you to keep walking, you were mugged, even though the mugging didn't happen in the way the media usually portrays it. This actually happened to a friend of mine in Manchester and he said that he didn't feel comfortable reporting it to the police because he literally handed this guy his phone without challenging a thing he said. I tried to tell him that he was mugged and that he needs to call the police, but he was steadfast in his assertion that it wasn't a mugging, and that it was just some strange happenstance thing that happened to him that he can't explain. I think its because the image of mugging we're presented with is usually a young black male wearing a hood coming up to you with a knife in his hand, and not this silverfox dude hanging around the busy city centre.

Although I do think that the definition of 'rape' is definitely very flawed here in the UK, I don't think its the reason victims of rape don't think they were raped. I think that issue stems from rape culture and the image of rape which is one the one hand trivialized and normalized through things like rape jokes, and then also demonized and caricatured so that we think of rape as a stranger in a dark alley, rather than a friend or acquaintance which actually makes up the vast VAST majority of rape cases.",0,1370560174,null,0,false,0,cadoowa,t3_1fsbhf,t1_cadoowa,t1_cado57a,null,1430900110,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Here's more info on the Surinder Singh judgement:

http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/policyandlaw/guidance/ecg/eun/eun2/#header14

I will say, it'd be a lot easier if you were married. I don't know how unmarried partners factor in; you'd have to check with whichever country you're applying to.

So here's the basic flow for a Surinder Singh claim:

* You get married in Chile (or wherever, Vegas, doesn't matter. This is *optional* but makes the process more straightforward).
* Your SO finds a job in another European country. You apply for an EEA family permit to join her there.
* You stay and work in that country for a year or so.
* You and SO move to the UK, exercising your Surinder Singh treaty rights to get an EEA permit (you *can* do this for unmarried partners in the UK; check out http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/policyandlaw/guidance/ecg/eun/eun2/#header11 )
* You are now eligible to work and get benefits. Yay!

I'd recommend talking with an immigration solicitor if you want to attempt this route. This option would allow you to do all this without getting married (probably) but it's far more complex. The easiest situation would be just to get married. The main benefit of the EEA permit is that it doesn't have a financial requirement.

Nobody's obligated to defend you or support you or agree with you. Life isn't fair.

You need to check your definition of a proven liar, because all I see is that one side of a purely subjective argument said the other was a liar. There's no outside person saying, ""yeah, that moderator's a lying shithead"" so until you bring me that, the moderator stays clean. Also, in your so-called defense of your post, you bring up the subreddit rule about ""Look What I Got!"" posts, where it pretty clearly says, ""These are allowed on a case-by-case basis if the merchandise is particularly appealing to the audience."" So seeing as your merch had already been pretty heftily discussed and dealt with, it was redundant and not worthy of the case-by-case approval.

How, exactly? They banned one post. Doesn't make you a permanently unwanted guest.

You've posted here five times in the past six months, and three of those posts were related to the stamps. That's not a ""vast majority of content"" in any sense. 

&gt;Threats of violence are pretty offensive, but I doubt any mod will enforce that rule against you.

1) subreddit rules cover posting, not comments

2) If you argue like a twelve-year old, I am going to stoop to your level and respond to you like one

3) You have been arguing with me all freaking day, and I think at some point I'm allowed to get a bit fed up with your lack of understanding.

4) If the mods find my comment inappropriate, they can remove it. In fact, I expect them to. 

&gt;No bullshit, and I did leave.

Yeah, and then you came back and made a pissy little, ""I've got the toys but Timmy was mean so I'm not sharing with anyone"" comment.

&gt;I simply commented on this person's post so they know why they can't get the content they would like, because of the moderators.

Holy shit, it's not the moderators. The moderators are not keeping you from uploading the picture. They clearly aren't keeping you from commenting. Nobody is keeping you from moving your hand and clicking the send button, nobody is keeping you from typing. This is you and only you.

&gt;If ""nobody"" has a problem with the moderators, then you should be happy to accept the reason that you don't get the content you desire from me.

Meireles was never supposed to be a great relevation. We had just missed out on our primary summer target Modric whom we bid 40m for. Meireles only cost 12m (could barely afford Lukas' legs for that much) and we recouped 8m out of that back on his sale.

He scored some key goals for us, especially the winner against Benfica that punched our ticket to the Barca semi-finals.

I don't care if goal.com employ Alex Ferguson himself: they are still statistically less reliable than any other UK printed newspaper, bar The People and Metro. For Liverpool rumours specifically, their accuracy lies at **8.3%**. The Guardian, in comparison, has **40.8%** accuracy, the Independent **39%**, the Times **26.9%** and the Daily Telegraph **40.7%**. 

That, to me, shows a marked difference in reliability. 

As for ""historically speaking"", I meant historically speaking broadsheets, since quite a few of them no longer use the broadsheet format. I wasn't implying a historical reliability - as the statistics above show, the papers are still much more accurate than goal.com. 

True, some online journalism is of an excellent standard. F365 and Zonal Marking are a good examples, for instance. Nevertheless, despite the editorial quality some Internet sites may have, that does not mean that their gossip sections will be of an equal standard. In fact, it seems that they are anything but. 

Yes, sometimes people follow crowds. But sometimes, if the majority of people believe something, it may not be because of herd mentality - sometimes people are actually capable of independent thought and may perhaps even be correct. 

Regarding Tevez, yes, you are right: he is likely to sign for whomever produces the best contract. In the world of Anzhi, Monaco, PSG etc. can we compete? I doubt it. _Should_ we compete, considering Tevez has a reputation of a fairly volatile prima donna, is 29 and that signing him would go against almost every player recruitment policy FSG have been advertising? I doubt that as well. But, as I explained earlier, I find discussions about Tevez highly speculative - if concrete evidence appears suggesting we are genuinely trying to sign the player, then he certainly demands a closer look.

Em, no. Normally it's me point this stuff out to people who believe everything on CNN, Fox or the BBC. Check my comment history if you must.  

Jones is insane because he believes everything. *Some* of it is true but he's generally pretty unreliable. If anything his personal abrasiveness harms the general ""truth out"" movement. He puts off more reasonable people, he comes across like an over-excited child. As a media spokesman he's pretty awful. 

WRT his factual accuracy, as someone who does actually know a bit more than average about the history of how the modern world came to be, his analysis is frequently wrong of even the things he discussing are inadvertently correct. He just doesn't understand how the world works. He knows nothing about propaganda, as is evident in his poorly produced clips. Propaganda is a personal interest of mine and his message only appeals to a very limited market, mostly male between the ages of 12-30. With the right PR manager he could change the world but the problem is he loves his own voice too much. 

As for whether he personally exposed Bilderberg: not a chance in hell. Peeps like me we chatting about this stuff back on usenet twenty years ago. It's old news mate. ",0,1370562526,null,0,1370562822,0,cadpi7g,t3_1ft7jo,t1_cadpi7g,t1_cadmven,null,1430899654,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Clara says she doesn't get it, so the Doctor continues, ""My name..my real name, that is not the point -- the name I chose is the Doctor""

See, we can't have John Hurt being in the time stream of the Doctor, and then the show writers write ""Introducing John Hurt as"" and finish it off with anything but the Doctor. If they introduce him as say, ""Mr. Spock"" then they've essentially given away the Doctor's true name. They could've written ""Sherlock Holmes"" or ""Shirley Bassey"" but the point of introducing John Hurt as the Doctor, is because we really have no other name to call the renegade Time Lord, except by the name ""The Doctor"".

They *could've* written ""Introducing the Doctor who really isn't the Doctor because he broke his promise"" and regurgitate everything Matt Smith just said, but that would be pointless.

The only other explanation I can see, if Steven Moffat is going to pull of another pun or something like that and did that purposefully as a tease, just like how the name of the last episode ""The Name of the Doctor"" was a tease. But the point remains that the actual Doctor has established that John Hurt is not the Doctor, though he is the same person. Hope I made sense.

I'm sorry, I can't let this one slip as it's so absurd. Note: I am not a royalist. I respect the Queen's commitment but that is where my loyalty to the Monarchy ends. 

Have you ever seen her travel schedule? Are you selectively reading news stories? Because anyone with half an eye on the press will realise that her public commitments are absurd, almost bordering on the obscene. Also, if there was a terrorist bombing at 2am in London, do you (or anyone else) not believe that she either a) has requested to be woken for such incidents, or, if not; b) gets a morning briefing and decides whether an official reply is necessary at 5, 6am? It is her JOB to be briefed. She's not just our Queen, she's gives permission for government formations, and as such, she has never put herself in a situation whereby she's not fully briefed on the current political climate (even if it is her researchers staying up all night, she still has to absorb it all).

It's not a 9-5 job. It's not all about having your bum wiped by your inferiors. That woman has, and will always work herself to the bone for her country. 

Not having a regular job has fuck all to do with it. She does twice, three times the amount of work than most of us would ever dream of doing. And for that, she has my utmost respect. Yes, it's fair to say that maybe it's not worth £34m a year or whatever it is, but you cannot, absolutely cannot fault her and imply that she is work-shy.",0,1370565692,null,0,false,0,cadqkxv,t3_1fri0d,t1_cadqkxv,t1_cadjs6s,null,1430899148,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

true,Let-them-eat-cake,null,null,"Thanks for the interesting points - ironically, I had a discussion recently with a good friend about our mutual rational cynicism - however, unlike most people (and him), I have the time to investigate the non-MSM evidence further - so I thought I'd expand on some points. With respect to the US election, some red flags were raised from the little investigation I did, but that's where it ended. When I was growing up in the UK, the US and it's constitution was something I viewed as a beacon of freedom and human evolution. What's happening in the US now and the constitution being ripped up is very sad and does not bode well.

As an aside, I trade currencies and commodities for my own account now, so I keep a close eye on market commentary and have watched the MSM fail to report on the realities of the corruption for years. Unfortunately for most people, the time and inclination to investigate what the MSM say (or don't say) is prohibitive - I'm lucky I have the time.

Non-reported (by the MSM) corruption is rife - my background was originally psychology at Uni, then latterly banking, commodities trading, insurance and government projects (business and IT). To say the least, history and seminal psychology experiments from for example, Zimbardo and Milgram, prove most people given any sort of power are corrupted by it. 20+ years of a career spanning a lowly beginning to climbing the greasy pole of management, proved to me corruption in banking, finance and govt in the three countries I've worked in, is endemic - and the MSM is most definitely and provably, complicit (a couple of examples/tip of the iceberg below). 

&gt; Also why does no major news source pick up his story? 

A few do pick up the story, the Guardian in the UK being one, RT being another - probably because it's Russian. [Daniel Estulin spoke to the European parliament](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHtO8Q119ms) about Bilderberg - again this was covered by RT, but absolutely no mention was made in any western media - take from that what you will - but further investigation (with time and inclination) takes one down the rabbit hole of abject corruption. As usual, it was not taken any further by the parliament or the MSM.

&gt; You might claim that the media is corrupted (I don't subscribe to this but that's another argument).

A recent example of a Bilderberg complicit MSM comes from the [UK Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7804197/The-Bilderberg-Group-fact-and-fantasy.html) - the journalist being bought and paid for by the powers that be is cringe worthy to behold. Another older one from the Economist is [here](http://www.economist.com/node/17928993).

CNN is also a proven puppet, [Amber Lyon and Benghazi being one of many examples](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression?newsfeed=true): *""I saw first-hand that these regime claims were lies, and I couldn’t believe CNN was making me put what I knew to be government lies into my reporting.""*

Whether it's centrally coordinated is something I'm not convinced on. Personally, I'd say it's a few major factions who fight or conspire depending on the subject and their personal agendas. It doesn't change the fact though that 6 companies own 90%+ of all US media outlets, or that there are [""The 147 Companies That Control Everything""](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/22/the-147-companies-that-control-everything/), from a Swiss Federal Institute of Technology report in 2011.

One huge and recent example is the LIBOR scandal, I first heard rumours (classed as conspiracy theories at the time) in 2006 - [Timothy Geithner is on record saying he knew about it in 2008, FT.com](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/8e0d9282-4931-11e2-b25b-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e0d9282-4931-11e2-b25b-00144feab49a.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz2VTlM2XnP). That's a crime. He's also been a Bilderberg attendee - one of many financial criminals who haven't been investigated or prosecuted who attended Bilderberg.

After the LIBOR scandal eventually broke in the MSM (with no further investigation by them), my personal rational cynicism (given previous evidence) lead me to investigate [Marcus Agius (Forbes.com)](http://www.forbes.com/profile/marcus-agius/), as he and his co-conspirators were intimately complicit - why has no one, including Agius not gone to jail for that? Matt Tiabi at Rollingstone is one of the few 'real' investigative journalists who covered this. ""[Everything is rigged](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/everything-is-rigged-the-biggest-financial-scandal-yet-20130425)"" is a seminal article which has been taken no further by the establishment (again).

Agius (a proven thief and conspirator), is at this year's Bilderberg meeting. An interesting coincidence - and funnily enough - he's married to [Katherine de Rothschild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Agius).

I live in NZ now and have requested info from the govt on the cost to the NZ taxpayer on how LIBOR affected NZ borrowing costs - to say the least I've been met with the run around and stonewalling. 'Rational cynicism' leads me to think there's more to that story too...

Another ongoing massive scandal completely ignored by the MSM is ""[World Bank Revolving Door of Corruption with Whistleblower Karen Hudes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wDcnrIzi3Y)""

true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; Nobody's obligated to defend you or support you or agree with you. Life isn't fair. 

Straw man.  No one is obligated to support the arab spring, either.  We're talking about whether or not I should help the community, not my obligations.  Since my support didn't generate defense or support or agreement in return, there's no benefit to my supporting.

&gt; You need to check your definition of a proven liar, because all I see is that one side of a purely subjective argument said the other was a liar. There's no outside person saying, ""yeah, that moderator's a lying shithead"" so until you bring me that, the moderator stays clean.

You need the thread again, then.  The other mod comes in and shows that Signe lied when she said those were the only two posts removed, when in fact there were three and a banning as well she didn't mention.  She also lied about the frequency of the stamp posts, which I provided a link to disprove; this is not a subjective call.

&gt; Also, in your so-called defense of your post, you bring up the subreddit rule about ""Look What I Got!"" posts, where it pretty clearly says, ""These are allowed on a case-by-case basis if the merchandise is particularly appealing to the audience."" So seeing as your merch had already been pretty heftily discussed and dealt with,

This is thing thing.  It had NOT been done so, as I showed.

&gt; it was redundant and not worthy of the case-by-case approval.

Except 500 upvotes indicates that it was ""particularly appealing to the audience"".  People specifically ASKED me to post pictures when I got the item and specifically THANKED me for providing them.

&gt; How, exactly? They banned one post. Doesn't make you a permanently unwanted guest. 

I'ave already explained this.  By banning me, deleting three posts (not one), and by not apologizing for any of it, they make me a permanently unwanted guest.  Certainly not one that will go out of his way to provide content to a subreddit that doesn't want his content.

&gt; You've posted here five times in the past six months, and three of those posts were related to the stamps. That's not a ""vast majority of content"" in any sense.

Again, this was all after the mods made me unwanted here.  That all began almost 9 months ago.

&gt; 1) subreddit rules cover posting, not comments

1) False

&gt; 2) If you argue like a twelve-year old, I am going to stoop to your level and respond to you like one

2) Since I haven't, I don't know why you bring this up, but whatever makes you feel good.

&gt; 3) You have been arguing with me all freaking day, and I think at some point I'm allowed to get a bit fed up with your lack of understanding.

No, you're never allowed that.  You are allowed to take a breath and realize that you're arguing the wrong side, though.

&gt; 4) If the mods find my comment inappropriate, they can remove it. In fact, I expect them to. 

And I expect they won't, per their demonstrated bias.

&gt; Yeah, and then you came back and made a pissy little, ""I've got the toys but Timmy was mean so I'm not sharing with anyone"" comment.

Yeah, I did.  The community deserves to know why they aren't getting what they desire.

&gt; Holy shit, it's not the moderators. The moderators are not keeping you from uploading the picture. They clearly aren't keeping you from commenting. Nobody is keeping you from moving your hand and clicking the send button, nobody is keeping you from typing. This is you and only you.

Yes, they are.  Again, uploading the picture means the moderators continue to benefit from my content without having to change their draconian policies.  Up with that we will not put.  Their lack of contrition is, indeed, preventing me from uploading the picture.

&gt; Let me make this very clear for you. If I have the keys to my car, and you want to borrow that car, and I say no because the meanie cop on the corner gave me a speeding ticket when I was clearly speeding, it's not the cop's fault. The fault is mine.

Your analogy fails because you weren't speeding.  Furthermore, you left out the part where the cop then beat you up and bashed up your car.  You don't want to risk anyone else driving your car in town again because the cop could do the same thing to it again.

&gt; And it's the same way with you. You're trying to have your cake and eat it too. The only person stopping everyone on the subreddit from enjoying that picture is you. 

No, as I already explained to you, the people stopping me are the moderators.

&gt; No, I'm not happy

Then you have a problem with the moderators.

&gt; because the reason I'm not getting the picture is because someone with elementary-school sensibilities on morality and justice is being selfish and idiotic for wholly personal reasons. I've been arguing with you all day and I'm done. Have a wonderful life

You too.

true,FunkyPete,k9,K-9,"I think there would be a huge uproar, and then everyone would quickly get over it (as long as his accent was pretty much perfect).

Incidentally, I have always thought there was a huge parallel between Superman and the Doctor.


Superman is American (by accent, culture and upbringing) but an alien. He is immortal, but young (his adopted parents are still the right sort of age for him to be about 30-35). He WILL live forever, but he hasn't yet. He is the most powerful thing on the planet and is essentially invincible. He is smart, but wins each battle through force, the threat of force, or sheer power and strength to lift trains, planes, buildings, whatever. He is powerful enough to do almost anything.


The Doctor is British (by accent, culture and choice, essentially), but an alien. He is not quite immortal, but is close to it. He is almost a thousand years old but appears quite young (lately very young, but always looks to be within a regular human lifetime (for obvious reasons)). He is powerful, but not the most powerful being in his universe. He seems particularly well coordinated at times, but only occasionaly relies on that to win his battles. He mostly wins because he is very very smart, and re-invents himself completely rather than dying.

I find the parallels between the US (a very young country that is probably militarily the most powerful nation in the history of the world) and Britain (a very old country that is very powerful, but changed itself from a relatively isolated island to the world's premier military and economic super power and then to a superpower relative to most of the world with terrific cultural influence that knows when to pick its military battles).

The whole reason I told you that theory was this -- Superman is being played by a Brit. If he played him with an English accent, it would be outrageous. But he'll do a great job and no one will care. I think people would get over it if an American played the British Superman, as long as he played the CHARACTER as a Brit.",0,1370574658,null,0,false,0,cadtshl,t3_1fu1kd,t1_cadtshl,t3_1fu1kd,null,1430897635,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

I'd also disagree that he has the potential to be better than Henderson. Henderson has shown he has great ball technique and passing range, more so than Jonjo. Plus he's an incredible athlete. The only thing Jonjo has got over him is power. I've not seen enough of Allen in a red shirt to argue for him, but I think he's more capable than Shelvey too.

The rash tackling might not be something he grows out of. Mentality is a huge part of the game and it's what prevents many players from reaching the top. You can have all talent and ability in the world but if you don't turn it on when the referee blows that first whistle, what use is it?

true,monolisa,martha,Martha,"I just wrote this on my tumblr:


There has been *so* much talk recently about the possibility of the Doctor being cast as a woman in this next regeneration. Many of the feminists around say they would like to see a female Doctor. And yeah, it might be interesting. But I think there’s lots of problems with it that absolutely would not be addressed in the show.

(PS, I’m pretty sure I stole a chunk of my argument from someone else somewhere on the internet but I’m not sure who. So I’m sorry if I’m parroting here.)

First of all, I don’t want a female Doctor unless Moffat gets kicked out at the same time. Dude is so clueless about respectfully writing women, and writing them like real people. A female Doctor under Moffat would be subjected to so many unnecessary comments about her female-ness. She would not be dressed for her own utility and comfort; her costume would reflect “Look! Doctor’s a lady doctor!” shit- i.e. boobs + “the legs”. Lest we forget all the casually sexist things Moffat’s inserted in Who since the beginning of his reign, remember that a female Doctor would be subject to them too. 

Second, and most importantly, changing the Doctor to female brings up a slew of issues that simply ARE NOT going to be addressed in the show. Remember, gender is what’s in your head, sex is what’s between your legs. This is a character who has been reliably male for the past 1000 years or so. I think we can say that his GENDER (psychologically) is established as male. At least on screen, we have not seen him be uncomfortable about being a man. 

SO. What the FUCK would it say to trans people if, as soon as the Doctor is cast as a woman, his psychological sense of being a man just vanishes? And like, you *know* that’s all that would happen. Someone like Moffat, on a “family show” absolutely would not have any discussion about the Doctor feeling that his new body didn’t match his psychology. A female Doctor would absolutely just be reduced to biological explanations of gender. She’d be someone who is instantaneously and completely female simply because she has breasts and a feminine face.

“But every new Doctor has a new personality as soon as they regenerate!,” you say. Yes, but many carry the same overarching principles. And they carry with them the experience of the last 1000 years. Making the Doctor quirkier, or younger looking, or giving him a new catchphrase, or finally making him ginger doesn’t conflict with his sense of self.

So, to all of you who would like a female Doctor, that’s fine. But think about what that REALLY means for the story, the fans, and for the character you love. 

You may want a female Doctor out of wanting female representation, equality, etc. That’s fine. But feminism and equality that does not include trans people and trans issues IS NOT feminism or equality. Making the Doctor a woman isn’t going to solve anything unless those deeper issues can be addressed.

From what I've seen when he performs, he is able to make really good passes, push the ball up the field, and put himself in good scoring opportunities, though his finishing needs quite a bit of improvement.

The author of this article, Stephen Moss, claims to think he understands ""the political right-wing"" by claiming they should applaud the success of this individual. For what, exactly, Stephen Moss? Abusing people's emotions? For giving Londoners the impression all beggars are actually quite wealthy?

Clearly Mr Moss neither has the heart to support people genuinely in need, nor the intellect to understand the abuse being perpetrated, which nobody on any political side should celebrate.

How the hell Stephen Moss got a ""left-wing/right-wing"" separation of ideals into this story is beyond me. Some people are so political they can't just admit when somebody is plain wrong.

The comment of yours which was downvoted was the one that I was referring to. You later went on to provide some good examples that backed up what you said, at least to a degree. But, in my mind, you deserved to get downvoted for posting such an absolutist comment without providing support. I wouldn't make a claim dripping with certainty without providing a source, so I think it's fair that others should.

But my issue is that when you or anyone don't bother to post evidence or at least explain your reasoning a little in detail, you just come off like an asshole who fancies himself the smartest guy he knows and is gracing the peons with his sage-like wisdom. You probably aren't that way (probably :) ) but that can account for some downvotes as well. 

When I get downvoted to shit in this or any sub I don't get upset about the sub, I try to think about if I made a mistake. If I didn't, and my comment was quite good and followed reddiquette, then perhaps I'd complain. But there is a lot to learn from downvotes, my man.

Again, let me stress that you seem a smart supporter and I value your opinion more than most here (don't get ahead of yourself, haha, a lot of that is due to the fact that you don't end every post with ""YNWA""), but try to remember that sometimes the radical opinion is just as unfounded as the fanboy one.

That said, the rules aren't entirely without their reason. As a long time poster, there was a time in which the rules were much more relaxed, and much more content was allowed. The problem was that, as the subreddit gained momentum, a lot of the content that is now disallowed vastly overwhelmed any original and interesting posts. Original content, and good discussion, was completely ignored as the same exact content was upvoted to the front page day in and day out.

The content, as it is allowed or disallowed, was a direct result of this. So people who have creative or original content don't get drowned out by people upvoting memes, screenshots, or statues of angels outside their house.

We're always open to hearing suggestions and ideas. It is important, however, to keep in mind that the rules aren't just there because we like to keep ourselves busy enforcing them(And believe me, we do stay busy, and it would be easier to just drop half of them).

true,Clockwork_Hermit,null,null,"The voice in The Pandorica Opens (the one which declares ""Silence will fall"") does not seem to match up with any of the known characters involved with the Silence. It seems to be that of an older man. You might be able to make an argument that it was the Great Intelligence, but the Silence connection does not make a whole lot of sense then.

The MO does not match up with the future behaviour of the Silence, either. In series 6, the Silence are a more subtle enemy. Their plan involves using the Church as a smoke screen, double kidnapping through ganger-swaps, training and brainwashing River, and manipulating a still point in time to create a fixed point. In comparison, blowing up the TARDIS was a brute force attack.

They also do not try it again. Either the Doctor fixed whatever they exploited, or that one failure was arbitrarily enough for them to change tactics entirely.

Given the lack of real information, my theory would be that the one behind the attack was an affiliate of the Silence who preceeded Madame Kovarian in her role as strategist in the conflict against the Doctor. He likely fell out of favour when his plan failed, and was either killed or demoted to a position of little consequence.

((In general, I feel that the Silence arc was not completed to satisfaction. The Doctor's seeming ""victory"" has some weaknesses. Since they apparently have time travel capabilities, the Silence should be aware that their plan failed. It is disappointing that they will possibly be finished as an enemy soon.))",0,1370585754,null,0,false,0,cadx5ir,t3_1fts2k,t1_cadx5ir,t3_1fts2k,null,1430895979,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,bcash,null,null,"This makes very little sense.  It sounds as though a number of groups, each talking about slightly different things, have got together and after mis-interpreting each others findings think they've got a case.

The existing laws cover realistic depictions of rape, whether staged or otherwise.  The criteria being that it has to be both realistic and pornographic.  At least this was the original justification for why the ""extreme pornography"" laws has vague paragraphs saying ""acts which are likely to lead to life-threatening situations"" - i.e. it's not just scenes of butchery which are banned, but any porn where non-trivial violence is a threat, even if not seen. [1]

So the only theoretical ""gap"" in the law is depictions of rape without (even implicit non-spoken threats of) violence.  In the real world this is just as big a problem as rape with violence, I don't want to trivialise anything.  But on film, how exactly would this be defined?

This is why I'm a bit suspicious of the motives of these people (some of them), and why they're making a big deal out of the word ""consensual"".  It sounds very much like they're trying to widen the definition of rape to include scenes where the ""victim"" is seen pro-actively planning, encouraging and enjoying the acts depicted.  Instead using the logic that there must have been behind-the-scenes unprovable ""psychological violence"".  Simply being staged is already not a defence.

[1] - this was the original justification, what's actually happened in real-life cases I don't know.  And indeed it's the nature of censorship that we're not allowed to know what we're not allowed to do/see/watch.  But I'd be very surprised if there'd been many not-guilty verdicts to the possession of ""sadistic violence"" as mentioned in the original article.  

There may be no need for a change of the law at all, it may be that these campaigners don't know what they're campaigning about.  Indeed they will have broken the law if they've done research into it.  Or, more likely, they don't care and they're on a more general anti-pornography agenda and are cynically trying to link it to otherwise unrelated real-world tragedies because people aren't taking them seriously otherwise.

3 - I think as soon as Clara entered the timestream she became aware of the entire timestream at once because she doesn't move through it chronologically, she experiences it all at once. Maybe it's not exactly like this but the ""run you clever boy and remember"" line makes it seem as if she is at least partially aware of some or all her other incarnations/instances.

4 - This could be an alternative answer to #3. Maybe Clara didn't always succeed, afterall. She is going up against the GI.

5 - I realize it's not really a question. I agree with your view, it's pretty ironic. But a lot of other people think the reason she was able to hack into the Dalek web was because she was herself a Dalek (I don't agree with that view).

The old houses are not exactly great, but it's better than nothing. At least it's reasonably close to the sciences (max. 15 minutes walk) and sports centre.

In the old houses there is no common room besides a little kitchen. The new refurbished ones will supposedly have a proper common room / larger kitchen. I think they just tear down the wall between the kitchen and one of the 6 rooms. Not a problem really since the walls are very thin. I could hear my flat mate chew through them ... then again walls in DRA/FP apartments are not *that* much thicker, that's just one of the issues you have to deal with in student accommodation I suppose. It may also be than I'm a little bit more sensitive to noise than normal people.

The bathroom is kind of old but overall still ok. I've seen way worse.
There are actually two. One upstairs with only a toilet and sink and one downstairs which also has a shower.

The only real problem is the winter. It get's fucking cold in those houses with their single pane windows. Heating is disabled most of the day. Pack warm clothes and fingerless hand gloves if you want to work on your laptop. At least that's what I did. ;) Many people also just went to the library.

Dunno if they will actually put in proper windows and insulation during the refurbishment.
The rooms are not huge but big enough IMO. You've got a bed and a desk and that's about it.

Other than what we've mentioned plus you sometimes find out that the parent company of both the agency and the umbrella company tend to be one and the same.

TBH as they want you to be self employed so they can get around the rules I think I'd do what a truly self employed person does. Do well at this company, make yourself invaluable. Find out what rate the agency are charging then offer the company to go direct and undercut the agency. Agency can't complain or trot out ""its in our terms"" because then that means they know you were actually an employee and they were breaking the law. Although umbrella companies charge the earth compared to an accountant you could actually use the same umbrella company to invoice the client.

Oh and if you do this or decide to leave, don't give any notice, just don't turn up again and drop them right in it with their client. After all, you're self employed as far as the agency is concerned so the statutory notice period does not apply either to you or you giving one to them.

What annoys me is that they're often not clearly marked.  If it was clear when a camera was coming up, then more people would slow down.  You could argue that every ticket issued is a failure of the speed camera in question, because someone's got past it at an unsafe speed (most likely having not noticed the camera).

I also don't really understand mobile speed cameras - worse still mobile cameras that are NOT signposted (There was one in Portsmouth last weekend).  How could having a speed camera once or twice a year in a particular spot affect driving habits?  And if it's not signposted, how is it going to make the flow of traffic any safer?  (in fact what you tend to get is a lot of sudden braking).

With respect to the report - I've not been able to read it all yet, but at a cursory glance I'm not sure I can see a 'control group'.  What they seem to be looking at is crashes before the camera vs. crashes after it, but maybe driving is generally getting safer, so what they'd need to show is that where no camera was installed, the reduction in accidents/injury was less.  If there is no control group, the data cannot be used to reach any conclusion about speed cameras.  (Forgive me if I've missed it - I've just finished a night shift and am dying a little).

---

In Oxford when they turned off the cameras for 6 months, we got this data (which is quite cool because it's a sort of crossover study):

**At Camera Sites**

| Cameras  | Accidents   | Injuries     |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| On ('09-'10) | 60 | 68 
| Off ('10-'11) | 62 | 83 

**All of Oxford**

| Cameras  | Deaths   | Serious Injuries     |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| On  ('09-'10) | 12 | 160 
| Off ('10-'11) | 18 | 179 

In this data, the although the number of injuries (their severity isn't classified) increases, you can see that it increases across all of Oxford and not only at speed camera sites (I'm not sure what constitutes an injury but since the Guardian article I used as a source seems to distinguish between 'Injuries' and 'Serious Injuries' I'm led to believe that not all injuries are 'Serious Injuries' or deaths).  You could argue that some other variable comes into play (perhaps the weather in August 2010 to Jan 2011 was worse that the previous year, or there was one particularly big crash).",0,1370593863,null,0,1370595499,0,cadylyv,t3_1fujg5,t1_cadylyv,t3_1fujg5,null,1430895292,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I really don't understand this way of thinking, surely it's clear as day to everyone that whilst he's far from terrible, due to injuries suffered playing for Liverpool and Spain, Torres is no longer a World Class striker nor will he be again. 

If Chelsea are serious about challenging for top honors next season, then they are going to need a World Class striker, i.e. Cavani. Whilst Lukaku has looked very promising so far, I still feel he's at least a season or 2 away from being the first choice striker at a Title/Champions league winning team.

Whilst having Torres as a back up striker on the bench for rotation/sub role isn't a terrible option, for the wages he is on, it just isn't justifiable when Lukaku and Ba would provide much better options for a far less considerable cost.

Due to his wages, finding a club to take on Torres is going to be no easy task, but I'll be shocked if moving him on isn't one of Mourinho's top priorities.",0,1370594225,null,0,false,0,cadynt4,t3_1fula5,t1_cadynt4,t3_1fula5,null,1430895268,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

The simple argument against that is if you need to slow down for a camera you should slow down anyway because you'd be speeding.

In a few cases there are more to it than this, especially with mobile speed cameras, for instance placed just after a reduction in speed limit rather than a mile downstream, but for the most part I have no problem with them.

Hidden cameras are presumably there to ensure you keep to the speed limit at all times, because you never know where there might be one.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"&gt;We spend hundreds of thousands of pounds training these people to be able to handle severely stressful situations and trust them not to kill anyone and ruin the mission, and you think they won't be able to handle a classroom? 

It's not a question of handling a classroom. One can handle a classroom without serving in the military. Nothing that you have said above suggests that ex-military personnel are better suited for teaching than any other person. Schools are not military zones - the training you mention above is redundant. 

Furthermore, I suggest ex-military personnel are _unsuitable_ because of this training. As I implied in my above post - joining the army is voluntarily joining a, by its very nature, violent organisation. That is not the moral compass I want my children to follow. 

If we are to fast-track anyone, why not go for people who have a long-standing commitment to, for instance, charity organisations? 

&gt;I would bet my left nut that the percentage of violent incidents from ex soldiers is far lower than the general public. We train them to handle those kinds of situations because you don't want anyone walking around with a gun to shoot first and think later; you need your troops to be able to deal with stress and manage people in an amicable manner. 

As /u/gazzthompson's link suggests, this is not necessarily the case. Furthermore, as stated above, I do not see why military training is necessary for handling a classroom. Schools are about teaching basic knowledge, social skills and modern moral values. I do not see where military training involving ""severely stressful situations"" and teaching people ""not to kill anyone"" when walking around with a gun fits in all that.

City have got money to burn this year.  Not only have our TV revenues just doubled which will give us an extra 40m (not including commercial revenue gains which are linked to TV viewership), look at who is going from the wage bill:

Lescott - 120k = 6.2m a year

Toure - 100k = 5.2m a year

Bridge - 80k = 4.1m a year

Santa Cruz - 100k = 5.2m a year.

And that's without the possible, maybe and might be going that we hear about such as Nasri, Dzeko, Barry and Sinclair.  We've just gained 20m from not paying wages of players who are going out of the door.

All in, we probably have north of 100m extra to our 'normal' 50m spend.

Fernandinho is a guy identified by the scouting network as a key purchase.  If we bought a DM from Barca for 34m nobody would blink an eyelid; the problem here seems to be that people have never heard of him so automatically presume that he cannot be worth the money.  Fortunately, our scouts actually watch players and have an excellent technical and tactical knowledge to draw on rather than just checking their score on FIFA.

Do you think that a team like City, with all of our resources and modern working practices, just sat back and thought ""yeah, we'll throw 34m at a guy who might turn out to be good""?  City's ""dossiers"" compiled on players before they are purchased are legendary in their detail and length.  We are not the same Club who paid 18m for Roque Santa Cruz, our scouting systems and executive systems have completely changed.

We've bought him for 34m because the Soriano and Txiki believe him to be worth this amount.

Also, Txiki has a very hit and miss transfer record. It's like 60% succeed, 40% fail. I'm sure Fernandinho will be a big success at City though, I do, and if that's the case in 3-4 years the £30m won't matter at all - hell, it doesn't even really matter now.

I doubt as many tourists would visit Buckingham Palace if it wasn't for the fact there is a real living Queen that lives there, also think of all the royal markings over every post box and telephone box, walking to work during the summer all I see if tourists taking photos of the crown emblem on everything. 

Without the Monarch we would just be another country with a few old castles, yes tourists would still come but not as many as before. 

Side note: Don't we also make money from having a Queen? George III turned over profits of the land to the government in 1760 and instead took an annual salary, last year the crown estate brought in £230.9m while the queen only took £32.1m. So alone that's a big gain for the taxpayers.

I've had taxi drivers rate me as I walked past, been groped at clubs (so much that I can't bear to go to them anymore) and lots of catcalling.

Sexism exists towards men as well, obviously. But I think it's kind of intertwined. From birth we're given gender based identities almost immediately- dolls for girls, cars or action man for boys. We may grow up and develop our own identities eventually but it does linger in the background a bit- women are expected to have babies and be nurturing, men are expected to be strong and macho. The media doesn't always help with that either, though it's beginning to change somewhat. Not all male characters are alpha males or butch and not all women are sex objects primarily. I do think more work needs to be done on both sides though, but it's something.

I've been told men find it harder to get jobs at primary schools because it's seen as a role for women (based on the young age of the children), but do better in more senior roles.

true,spiz,null,null,"&gt; The simple argument against that is if you need to slow down for a camera you should slow down anyway because you'd be speeding.

That's not quite what I meant to say.  By catching someone speeding you don't make the road any safer (unless you catch them 4 times in 3 years).  If, on the other hand, you sign post cameras clearly, 'speeders' would be more likely to slow down, thus making the road safer.

&gt; Hidden cameras are presumably there to ensure you keep to the speed limit at all times, because you never know where there might be one.

I don't think there are nearly enough of them to enforce a change on people's driving habits.  If there were, it would probably be a little Orwellian.

Similarly, I'm not posting against speed cameras - I'm certain if used well they can reduce accidents.  What I'm directing my post at is their use in a way that does nothing for safety (and consequently must be aimed at generating revenue), as well as constructing statistics that seemingly say the wrong thing.

reasoning being that we have spent a lot of money on a striker who didn't fit in our system, but now he is trying to improve. letting him go at this point will mean the transfer failed. keeping him will still give us an option to replace cavani with, during difficult days. Loosing 20mil for torres as a 2nd striking option is not bad for us, considering the amount of money we have in our hand. plus, he works well as a second striker these days, so a 4-4-2 style when we are thin on midfielders will be good too. keeping torres on bench and loaning lukaku for another year will be a great idea for lukaku's development too.

His opportunities were very limited, but he failed to really impress in the chances he has been given. Worst performance has to be against Oldham, where he looked utterly bullied and out of depth. For me he is too slow and cannot keep up with the physicality of the League. His stats are overall better in the Europa League, where the games tend to be a little slower.

That being said, I still think he has potential to be good defender. I feel his move to Liverpool came too soon. I wish he had instead gone to Italy for a few seasons before he came to us. Center backs usually play better as they get older, so maybe 3-5 years down the line he'll be a top player. He was voted the best young player in South America before he came to us.

Even after writing all this and looking up all the stats, I still can't decide if we should persevere with Coates. BR doesn't seems to be a big fan, but he has good potential.

He needs to be moved on and we should remember Fernando as nothing more than a commercial success. That being said I'm more than up for a move for a striker like Cavani. Like you said Lukaku is a class player, but I think he's still a year or two away from being Chelsea quality. A one year loan and then a year of being Cavani's understudy can prove to be amazing for him and Lukaku can turn out to be the best striker in the world as well as an excellent fit for Chelsea's playing style.

true,SewHappyGeek,null,null,"Why'd you have to be all mean about 'never becoming like us' because we deal with lime scale? Lol 

Ok, so I'm a Yank who's lived in the UK for over a decade. We didn't really have lime scale in IL, but obviously I do now and know how to deal with it. 
Lime scale is calcium carbonate. If it really, really bugs you, the only way to get rid of it is to replace it with sodium carbonate. You can do that by installing a water softener. If your pipes aren't really old, the water softener will not only replace the calcium in your water supply with sodium carbonate, it will clean the lime scale out of your pipes (slowly). 

I personally do not like soft water. I don't like showering in it as I never feel 'clean'. I don't like the taste. So I deal with lime scale in the following ways - Brita filtered water for the kettle. Heating the water makes the calcium carbonate more soluble - it doesn't make it appear, it just makes it easier for it to adhere to other surfaces. It's still present in cold water. Some water has higher concentrations than others, but *unless it's been softened, ALL water has calcium carbonate.* Even your bottled water. The Brita filter helps filter much of it out.

We still have to descale the kettle, but not very often and very little lime scale accumulates. We also use Calgon tablets in the washing machine. Because this softens the water, you only need about half the amount of detergent. So it's not as expensive to use as might first appear. It kept our old washer going for 15 years! We have a dishwasher and use dishwasher salt in it as well as the all-in-one tablets. No spots on my china, dammit! Lime scale also accumulates where water sits - shower heads, water taps, tubs, etc. Viakal is an excellent cleaner. I use it for the entire bathroom including the glass in the shower. If you want to go natural, vinegar will dissolve lime scale. There's also gel that you leave on for a bit while it very efficiently eats the lime scale. That shit is boss. Lime scale is gross, but if you keep on top of it with Viakal and whatnot, it's no big deal. Really.

TL;DR if you don't want lime scale to become part of life, you'll have to invest in a water softening system to replace that calcium carbonate with sodium carbonate.

&gt;I think there is a big communion in White Hart Lane between the players and the fans. We won a lot of important games this season, like against Arsenal and Manchester City, where we felt the power of the fans. It’s a great feeling

&gt;I had a lot of good moments this season, I hope to have great moments in the future and I also hope to win trophies with Tottenham

&gt;It’s very important for the club and also for the players and the supporters, to grow up together, and why not do that next season?

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"So sitting down and thinking about this carefully, what are the NSA doing, what are they capable of doing and why is it a problem:

They have essentially free access to most private electronic data. Even if you don't use Gmail etc. if you have it synched to your phone then there's no reason to believe it is not stored by them. This includes all those pictures that auto-share to google drive as well by the way so that naughty pic you sent your other half? yeah they have that. 

What can they do with this? Well we as individuals aren't particularity interesting except where our interests run counter to the US. i'm thinking in particular about the commercially sensitive data I have stored or shared using Gmail for large funding bids. The other issue is with people in important offices who are exposed to blackmail, particularly going forward. Head up a bank division competing with the US interests for a major chunk of money, your an MP that's asking awkward questions, better hope you have NEVER had something embarrassing communicated about you in electronic format? 

I would be interested in how many people on reddit feel that they still have a substantial chunk of their private data intact? At the moment the only privacy you have is in the fact that they have too much data and can't possibly examine it all. As soon as you do something that brings you to the attention of the US going forward....

Yeah....um...hard water disables soap. So I don't know how....Nevermind!

I realize it's still present but does it only affect things when it is heated?

I've had soft water all my life. Evian bottled water here is not soft water it is in the US.

Calgon cost more to use then the price of replacing your washing machine more. Oh look you know about the soap thing but think it only applies to clothes. Amusing.

Salt makes things rust. I don't want salt in my water.

I don't know anyone who hasn't broken that law and now the law is being changed because it was realised it was completely incompatible with how society expected the law to work. 

Law should be the servant of the citizenry not the other way around. For example having gay sex has gone from a crime punishable by death, to a crime that would put you in jail, to legal but with a higher age of consent to the same age of consent. Throughout all that time should have gay people simply submitted themselves to laws that we now as a society largely regard as barbaric and unjust?  

The issue is that laws are codified social norms and as such inherently fall behind the curve of current ones and one of the major ways we see these kind of laws change is by mass civil disobedience in the face of those laws. It's part of the social contract that we allow ourselves to be rule by laws that act for the best interests of the society but only so long as those law reflect those interests. 

This is why when the interests of the law are no longer the interests of the citizenry you get revolutions. In the short term you end up with a conflict between what people expect and what the law does. In this case I find it absurd that what she did was a crime (i'd have not thought twice about pointing someone to a dealer if they asked) and so do a lot of people and it's a sub set of a much larger conflict between the law and social norms in terms of the drug legalization.

Grammar schools for example often pick and choose their students, they let what you call ""the wheat"" in and not the chaff. But they judge it on the student's own merits, not what god they do or do not believe in.

Why do you falsely claim that if students are not allowed to be bullied into saying how great someone elses god is and pretend to be one of them is somehow related to not letting lazy/poor students into a school?

No, it is just a terrible, badly thought out, omnishambles of an idea. It's a tax grab from the poorest in society based on the politics of envy and selfishness. As has been pointed out in numerous threads on this issue, there is no shortage of housing for families outside the south east (Re: London). There is a general lack of social housing stock overall, but the percentage available with multiple bedrooms is not an issue.

It has also been shown that, in general, rents in social housing are cheaper than a comparative property in the private sector, and that there is a lack of alternative property for most of those effected to move to even if they wanted to move. 

So, what they are saying is that people across the country should move just because there is a problem in London. When people do move it will generally be a more expensive private sector house, and that in the areas where a case can be made for people to move (again London) there is just not enough of the right type of housing stock.

British Actors have been reported, in Hollywood, as being informally referred to as 'White Mexicans'; an epithet that is supposed to indicate that they do good work for relatively little money and don't make lots of diva-like demands about trailer size and things. The implication is that US Actors are demanding, expensive and less able; so why would we bother?

Seriously why do you think this? I can 100% promise you that they do not if the service you are communicating with isn't in the US. Do you think every UK ISP has a fat transatlantic cable to US data collection authorities? If I access gov.uk to research a redditors benefit troubles, do you honestly think that request first passes through US systems?

You can prove it yourself with a tool already on your computer (tracert).

&gt;So are they violating EU Data Protection Act?

Firstly, it is the Data Protection Directive and you cannot violate it. You can only violate laws of child jurisdictions. In the case of your example, the Irish Data Protection Act.

The question you need to be asking is if these companies are Safe Harbors, and if so, do laws of the US such as FISA and the Patriot Act contradict it. (short answer is yes to save your research time).

&gt;It is. It's not ludicrous. This is how the internet works.
To make it more clear. UK to UK data still goes through the US. And should be protected by our laws.

Really. That is not how the internet works at all!

It's not like we have tests, reports from previous schools/preschool or interviews.... That is how grammar schools do it, why couldn't faith schools? 

Also being (for example) catholic, and getting up on Sunday doesn't prove you work harder, are smarter or more motivated than a Jewish student.

---Edit in reply to your edit---
It seems we are almost on the same page, we both see faith schools as unfair, but we should ignore them and create a better solution, while I see it as a ""we can fix it"" solution.

This is the only place I really talk about Liverpool as well (American, so all my friends who're into ""soccer"" like the best FIFA teams, save the few oddballs who like Spurs because either they want to be unique or because of Dempsey) so I can understand people being upset when they are actively engaged in a topic and get dismissed, but getting dismissed or unfairly criticized/ostracized on the Internet is like diarrhea - it happens, to everyone. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm in support of this thread's goal, you don't want people leaving this website because [they're too many assholes and not enough dicks, but if you're really going to get upset about an Internet community's popularity system or anonymous people with dissenting views saying rude or even agregious things at you with the communitity's support then you need to be less of a pussy](http://youtu.be/fPDmD3sz7go) WARNING: link contains NSFW language and fake vomit.

For the people reading this who have been afraid to post because of Internet backlash: get over it; if you have something you want to contribute then post it, who cares what others think? Opining isn't about making friends, it's an act of self expression. The meaning you attribute to downvotes and upvotes, to Reddit Karma is only an extension of yourself; be a bit more socio-nihilistic on this network, realize what others believe about your statement means nothing, and I'm sure you'll find that not all of your posts will be downvoted to ~~Manchester~~ Hell and maybe some of them will be well received!*

Yes

The paradox is how these two can exist side by side, and that's where most people just don't understand this country.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"Do you think he is a reasonable target? Can we get him here, and does he want to come?

I think he is reasonable, though I do hope we also get a younger promising striker.  I think his experience and abilities speak for themselves, he is a very good player.  His price wouldn't be too ridiculous, I would hope we could get him in the range of £10m, though perhaps I am just as unwilling to pay large fees like Levy.  I don't know if he wants to come, I would think that he may not really feel comfortable at Barca since he hasn't really been utilized, though granted it is mostly due to injury.  I think we have a chance of appealing to him, but I'm not in his head.
