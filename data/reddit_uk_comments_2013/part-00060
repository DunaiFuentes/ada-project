true,shoryukenist,null,null,"Iraq was the worst thing ever, and I am ashamed and disgusted by it.  Pure war profiteering.  I also think it did more damage to perceptions of our country than can be possibly estimated.  I studied in London in '98, yes, people were wary of Americans, but more or less seemed to like us.  Since then, I think we are widely disliked.

I'm not to sure about your 5 year comment.  Our relative power is declining, but we will still be hegemon, if to a less degree.  We are very, very slowly moving towards a more multipolar world, or we could descend into choas tomorrow I suppose.  

Anyway, I'd be careful placing any bets on China, their internal economic situation is set for a meltdown.  The only asset people are permitted to invest in is real estate, no financial products.  I'm sure you have seen all the reports of the ghost cities, such vast overbuilding is not going to turn out well.  Additionally, the people are getting quite upset about the environmental issues as well.  If you have read much on Chiniese history, once things get bad, the people go into full fledged revolt.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person."," - Estate agents are paid by the vendor, not by you. That being said, quite often they'll advise their client to accept an offer simply so they can tie up the sale - they don't earn any money until the sale is complete.
 - Gazumping isn't entirely dead, though it's less common. Demand that a condition of any offer you make is that the property comes off the market immediately.
   - If you're buying a repossessed property, you can't make this demand because the bank has a legal obligation to get the best price possible.
 - Any half-decent solicitor will ask the necessary questions about property ownership and carry out searches to ensure that the house isn't built on top of a big hole in the ground. But they won't ensure that the place will suit you; that's your problem.
 - The mortgage company will insist on a survey; usually they'll arrange a surveyor themselves (though this will be at your expense). The basic valuation survey just checks that there's nothing glaringly obvious wrong from the outside - pretty much all it will tell you is ""Yes, there's definitely a house at this site"". There's usually two other options - a homebuyer report and a structural survey. The homebuyer's report is a bit more detailed than the basic survey. A structural survey will be even more detailed, involve a lot of time and cost even more - usually you wouldn't do this unless you were buying a property you know has potential structural issues and you want to know exactly how bad they are.
 - Plaster cracks from time to time. Small cracks in the corner of a room aren't necessarily a problem, the thing you want to look out for are big cracks, particularly deep cracks going vertically up the wall. 
 - ""Freehold"" means you're buying the house and the land it's built upon. ""Leasehold"" means you're buying the right to live in the house, but that right is doesn't last forever, it expires after a number of years. Because it expires, the value drops as the time left on the lease drops. There's various legal routes you can follow if you buy a leasehold property and live in it until the lease expires, you don't necessarily have to move out. But you'd almost certainly have to get a solicitor involved at extra expense.
 - The area is just as important as the house. Try and find out how well your vendors get on with their neighbours and if they've had any crime problems.
 - Don't spend all your money the house itself. On the day you move in, you'll discover all sorts of extra expenses you never even thought about, and many of those you'll have to deal with straight away. Curtains, for instance, are quite expensive and are often kept by the seller.",0,1364565110,null,0,false,0,c94m6yg,t3_1b7f11,t1_c94m6yg,t3_1b7f11,null,1431740547,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

My experience would be that I'm describing what many feminists claim to be, and few do. It's a semantic issue really, I mean anyone who supports equality is my ally, so if they happen to do that while flying under the banner of ""feminist"" then they're still my ally, I've just met far too many people on both ""sides"" of this who are essentially just trying to improve the situation for their own gender, and either openly don't give a shit about the other, or claim to but do absolutely nothing to support any improvement in inequalities affecting that gender.

&gt;There are just too many angry misogynists and men who haven't been laid in too long on reddit to have a sensible discussion about it.

This is true to an extent I agree, although obviously as a libertarian I'm an equality of opportunities kinda guy so that instantly puts me in opposition to feminists of the /r/srs variety. There are also *certainly* issues that face men which need *someone* to work towards fixing them, just as there are for women, and all of these issues should be tackled, and imo tackled together by the same groups of people.

Obviously I haven't performed any high level research, but I feel all to commonly that rights groups for both genders focus solely on their own genders situation, so I tend to dislike 'em.

The US had very little to gain by assisting the UK in the Falklands War. It would have reaffirmed UK-US relations, but that relationship would continue either way, but if the US did help the UK in the Falklands War, it would have angered not just Argentina but also most of South America which supported Argentina's claim to the Falklands.

Yes, that precisely, it is a strict liability offense, where one has breached it simply by uttering it.  There are very few strict liability statutes, perhaps the best known one would be statutory rape.  For example, you meet a nice girl out, she shows you her birth certificate and drivers license saying she is 21.  You go and meet her family, her pastor and the mayor, and they all tell you they remember when she was born in 1990.  You have sex with her, turned out she lied, she is really 15.  Despite your lack of intent, and the blatant fraud imposed on you, you will be arrested and could easily be convicted.

To be fair this isn't speculative or 'some might say' journalism.  It's a conviction on public record and direct quotes of the judge.

Obviously he has some dubious tastes but, reading between the lines,  I get the impression he's quite simple and borderline mentally impaired by normal parameters.  Mentally immature; a Steinbeck *Lennie* (Of Mice And Men) but without the physical stature.  In this case, when the judge and court psychiatrist don't think he's likely to be a repeat offender, then a suspended sentence with a supervision order might be the right call.

When a judge is saying things like 'although chronologically eighteen', 'passive', 'immature', 'easily led' (by a 13yo?!), 'naive' and 'lacking assertiveness' then it's political correctness code for 'This bloke is probably mentally younger than the girl, and was more prey than predator'.  Still technically a paedophile, and they rightly still have to protect minors, but he doesn't sound like an ongoing risk.

Mushrooms. I'm a chemist (well, student, but they tell us that by the last few months we should consider ourselves to be real ones since we know roughly what we're doing).

It was meant to, a little bit. I was supposed to get the first stage of drug development done if all was succesful, but it's been a shitty year for me in several ways and so I ended up doing a widescale screening, essentially setting up a research project for someone to finish. Looking for shit that passes the bioassays the biolabs do (anti-cancer and anti-bacterial is all they really give a fuck about).

&gt;I definitely think the world is still very much tilted towards men,

The world overall, I absolutely agree. The west is a different game though.

&gt;and most of the complaints and activities of most men's rights activists are driven by something other than a quest for gender equality (just as with ""White rights"" groups).

It makes me think that there may actually be some truth to the Suarez out rumors. Obviously we wouldn't be looking at these guys if we didnt think we had a shot at getting them, but where else would we the kind of cash needed to purchase them other than through the sale of our top player.


That being said, it may not be the end of the world if we do get rid of him. Obviously he will be impossible to replace, but simple economics says to sell at max value, and it appears as though Suarez is currently peaking. I dont want to loose our best player any more than the next guy, but the funds that he could generate could completely revamp our squad. The fact is, by the time we are ready to challenge for a title, Suarez will be past his prime.

I really don't get why his faith is relevant to the case.

He's received a terrible education.

He was not spared a sentence *""because he went to an Islamic faith school where he was taught that women are worthless""* - he was spared a sentence because he went to a school that failed terribly at sexual education.

true,rahrness,null,null,"After repeatedly watching and re-watching Asylum of the Daleks 
with great scrutiny, these are my fleshed-out conclusions and 
conspiracy theories:


**Assumption 1:** Moffat continues to be Moffat, as in the current 
season follows a similar structure to the two previous Moffat 
seasons. This means that the first episode of the series is 
the most important. Throwaway jokes and ramblings become 
critical plot devices.


**Assumption 2:** This current season will be the 11th doctor's 
final season. Lots of speculation points to this, I won't 
bother going into the details here.


**Conclusion 1:** The events of S7E1 are their own paradox, in 
need of ""fixing."" The 11th doctor obviously hasn't solved the 
mystery yet, but he realizes during the episode that he is 
inside of a paradox.


**Simple proof of Conclusion 1:** In the beginning of the episode, 
Daleks refer to the Doctor as ""predator"", the Doctor is 
visibly confused by this. At the end of the episode, Oswin 
saves the Doctor by making every single dalek forget the 
Doctor's identity. Upon being teleported back into the Dalek 
parliament, Daleks demand: ""IDENTIFY!"" to which he answers 
""The doctor, the oncoming storm, the predator.""


**Conclusion 2:** Oswin was never fully converted by the 
nanocloud, and really has survived 363 days.


**Simple proof of Conclusion 2:** Because she said so. When the 
Alaska crashed into the asylum planet, it's crewmembers began 
to be converted by the nanocloud, wether they be living or 
dead. The first crewmember who the Doctor encounters after 
landing on the planet was converted within two hours, and as 
such believes he has been on the planet for two hours. Oswin 
believes she has been on the planet for 363 days. If we assume 
that she has infact been converted, this means that it took 
363 days to occur. She does not even remotely exhibit the most 
defining Dalek trait: hatred. When she saves the Doctor from 
intensive care by deleting all memory of him from all Daleks, 
she is unaffected.


**Moffat-isms surrounding Conclusion 2:** When Amy lost her 
bracelet and the nanocloud began converting her, the first 
thing to go was her short-term memory.


At the episode's conclusion, flashbacks are shown of Oswin at 
the same stage as Amy, losing her short-term memory, wandering 
the underground corridors of the asylum immediately after the 
Alaska crashed. Now that her short-term memory is gone, how 
does she keep track of her time there?


When Oswin first appears to the viewer, she is speaking to 
herself in a voice recorder, as a journal or ""captain's log"" 
of sorts.


The Doctor asks Oswin what she's been doing for 363 days, 
hiding from the Daleks. Lacking short-term memory, she is 
incapable of properly answering, so she spits out the first 
memory which comes to mind. Moffat recycles this plot device 
every time the Doctor asks Oswin where she got the milk and 
eggs.


The real answer to the Doctor's question, what took place 
during the previous 363 days, lies in Oswin's voice recorder. 
It's contents will likely be revealed to us, the viewers, as 
we reach the season's finale. This follows Moffat's structure 
in the 2 previous seasons. Oswin's souffle is this season's 
version of the crack in the wall.


Something important happened on day 1, the day the Alaska 
crashed. Something important is set to happen on day 365, 
which the Daleks are terrified of, and are desparate to 
prevent. On day 363, they recruit the Doctor and the Ponds.


**Conclusion 3:** Oswin is NOT a dalek.


**Simple proof of Conclusion 3:** See conclusion 2. If it doesn't 
click at first, think about what conclusion 2 means. If Oswin 
has survived for 363 days, then Oswin is not a dalek. This 
being the case has massive implications and also raises new 
questions. The conclusion of the episode now makes no sense at 
all, so how do we go about explaining it? More Moffat-isms.


In series 6, the Doctor hid inside of a time/space 
ship/machine disguised as a person, which several characters 
conveniently and repeatedly forgot was possible. If it was 
possible in series 6, why is it not possible in series 7? If 
that ship could disguise as any person, why can it (or another 
similar model) not disguise as a dalek? Re-watch the Dalek 
Asylum episode with the idea that Oswin is hidden inside such 
a machine, and it'll explode your mind. At the episode's 
conclusion, even the Doctor is fooled by the disguise.

And finally the glut of students who move to the city, and are pretty much the embodiment of the song Common People by Pulp, financially secure with the familial safety net that allows them to live in excess. The central urban environment late at night is horrid, and the council either can't or won't spend money on doing things to make it safer.

No that's non-sequitur. Just because this particular school is an abomonation doesn't mean being a muslim is relevant to the case. This article and your comments are phrased to put blame on islam and present it negatively.

What do we do? ask all those big earners in the financial industry to pay back money they probably don't deserve? Ask banks to cancel debts incurred onto people? Or ask big Multinationals pay the taxes they owe?  
We have had one class of people which has made it their prerogative to protect themselves and their greed at the expense of the larger, poorer, less economically and politically savvy class. 

How about you think for yourself and try to learn the situation we face, Yes politics/economics is daunting, it’s boring but it basically controls the destiny of your life, Socratees. 
Mark's point here is trying to reawaken an interest in what problems face us all as a society and how we all need to work together.  He is trying to get you to think at least so you may start to draw dots together and realised where you and everyone else in your class is getting fucked over time and time again. 

He is not an economist/politician/historian/sociologist. He is just a comedian who is of the left wing who wants to try to get a message across. An important message that falls of death ears time and time and again for many reasons; one being that kind of stigmatisation of anything that might be socialist or communist as the path to failure, totalitarianism, misery and death. 

Class warfare is happening now! Wealth, capital and power are being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands and we are losing. Mainly because people like you and I are apathetic, depressed and distrusting of the system we live under but continue to obey. Frankly because we have no time, we have no confidence and we feel we are worn down by the stresses and struggles of life. Many of them are systemic and would not exists it we found ways to come together in common ground. Rather than wait for someone else to come up with a serious economic response. It's a joint effort.

In a way, it's restrictive to say these women can't be *all* these things at once: Flirty, intelligent, resourceful; adventurous; brave; scared; interested in the most interesting man in the universe. And they should be able to show flaws as well.

There have been plenty of female characters not remotely enamored of the Doctor. Remember Rita? Or Madame Kavarian? Madame Vastra (the Silurian)?

Very true. But he went to a muslim school and was taught a misogynistic view, by muslims, interpreting the koran and hadith. Let's not go down the No True Scotsman route eh ? In this instance it's Islam at fault. As pointed out elsewhere in this thread it could just as easily been Christianity or Judaism teaching that women are second class citizens, only there to do the bidding of men.

Muslims have certain obligations - the Hajj, Halal and circumcision for example.

Adam did not perform the Hajj. Therefore he was not a Muslim.

Circumcision was part of god/allah/yahweh's pact with Abraham. Anyone before that was not circumcised and therefore not a Muslim.

Much the same with hallal.

If you're not following the rules of Islam, you're not a Muslim. So there could be no Muslims before the Qu'ran. Others choose to claim all humans who submitted to god are Muslims - including Adam.

If you want a source, the Qu'ran will have to do
&gt;Say, verily my Lord hath directed me into a right way, a true religion, the sect of Abraham the orthodox; and he was no idolater. Say, verily my prayers, and my worship, and my life, and my death are dedicated unto God, the Lord of all creatures: He hath no companion. This have I been commanded: I am the first Moslem (Wa 'Ana 'Awwalu Al-Muslimin). S. 6:161-163 Sale

But, like so many verses in the Qu'ran this is contradicted elsewhere. In essence, the word Muslim is used in slightly different ways - observant and not-so-observant, and they're blurred in places.

here's the main difference: 

An O ring chain has a sealing rubber ring which is O in cross section (one contact patch).
An X ring chain has a sealing rubber ring which is X in cross section (two contact patches). 

Some people say you have to maintain X rings a lot more but I wouldn't know 
about it since I'm doing weekly maintenance myself anyway (FYI: I'm using X ring ).

the issue here is that a crime was committed (a fairly serious crime- statutory rape) yet no fitting punishment was carried forth.

a side note entertained by the judge being that ignorance of law is a perfect mitigating circumstance.

but youre right about details... it would make all the difference to me if it turned out the the girl of interest lied about her age saying she was 16. nalso, i refuse to believe that the man of article wasnt aware of age of consent.

i agree with the judges notion of jail doing more harm than good for a fool hardy individual of faith who has clearly been educated in controversy. the idea that such a man would be introduced to hardline islamist convicts is alarming. however, it is a serious crime that imo warrants a prison sentance. but judges are much more capable than i in these matters. its just me venting.

true,logicom,mcgann,McGann,"It's less about the pining (although Martha pining over the Doctor is a common criticism of her character) it's the overt flirtatiousness. Sure, Mickey and Rory were pining after their girlfriends (or wife in Rory's case) but they were never overtly flirtatious at inappropriate times. 

It just gives off the impression of Moffat trying to make the Doctor seem cool to young boys because all the girls love him. It's not *terrible* or anything but it was done far better (in my opinion of course) in RTD's era in non-Moffat episodes than in Moffat's era.

I would argue that it is restrictive in its own way. Women can be whatever they want in the show... as long as they're flirty and sassy. Again, it's not that there can't be a flirty or sassy female character, it's only when practically every female character is flirty and sassy that it starts to be restrictive.

It doesn't have to be specifically about the Doctor. Rita is a good example of a good character that isn't enamored by The Doctor. She didn't have to be flirty with the Doctor to be a good character. Madame Vastra might not be flirty with The Doctor, but her and Jenny sure as hell do flirt a lot. Remember in ""A Good Man Goes to War"" when Jenny jokingly asks why she was still with Vastra and Vastra flicked that soldier away with her tongue and she says ""oh yeah, that's why."" Again, it's not about any *individual character,* it's just a trend towards having female characters be needlessly overtly sexual. Kavarian was a villain so I wouldn't apply it to her since I suspect that Moffat inserts these traits into his female characters to make them seem more playful and fun.

Go out and get drunk so much that you'll get sick of it, so that you won't want to do it as much that next year and you'll study more. Second year's the hardest, (at least in engineering/sciences).

Make as many acquaintances as you want, and keep them around. It doesn't matter if they won't become real friends, the more people you know, the more parties and events you'll be invited to, the more people you'll meet, etc. You won't have nearly as many chances as in freshers' year to do this.

Don't study too much. Seriously. First year is not hard, and usually doesn't count for much. If you feel like you never have time to do other stuff cause you need to study, you are doing something wrong. On the other side, it's ok to say no to a night out if you *really* need to cram for an exam. Don't give in to peer pressure.

Sleep is overrated.

Try lots of different sports/societies/activities in the first month. Trying is free and you'll be able to switch in and out of everything for free. Even if you don't actually want to join that society for the whole year, but you are curious, just go along to the first couple of sessions.",0,1364581256,null,0,false,0,c94r5lw,t3_1b8kxi,t1_c94r5lw,t1_c94m92u,null,1431738208,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

&gt;Is Edinburgh a good city to live in, generally speaking?

I think so. It's safe (as long as you're not doing something daft) and imo it's really beautiful. The buildings aren't all grey and a lot of the city is Georgian (I think...but it's nice). Also, sometimes the dark greyness is beautiful in a striking way. A few months ago it was really foggy in the morning and my street looked like somthing out of a film (I live on a street that  has big arched bridges over it), it was pretty in a sombre way. 

It might be a bit depressing to move here from a beautifully warm and sunny country (it's almost April and it's been snowing), but it's not that bad. I do have an Australian friend though who likes to complain about the lack of sunshine though. 

&gt;Also, I get the impression that almost no one is ever on the streets.

I suppose it depends where you are, but there are always people on the streets, especially in the university areas (If you're at King's Buildings or the Vet School, this might not be true). There's a good mix of locals and students, and yeah, it's not quiet and boring. I mean, I've walked home at 4am and met people that I knew on the way. 

&gt;I don't know if I would have enough things to do as entertainment.

My main problem is that if I don't have enough time for all the entertainment available! If you're coming here as a student in September, you'll be here for fresher's week. Basically, it's the week before lectures start and it's full of events for new students. There's stuff for everyone- lots of club nights and pub crawls, but also zoo visits, coffee crawls, society taster sessions, films, erm... well, lots of stuff. Also, if you're living in University accommodation, there will be a few RAs keeping an eye on things. I'm one next year- we're employed to make sure that people settle in and to organise different things to help people meet each other and get to know the city. 

Really, it's what you make of it. You could sit in your room for the entire four years and only leave for lectures, which would be pretty miserable. But it's not hard to meet people and make friends. Joining societies is good for that- it's a really easy way to meet people who are interested in the same things as you are (and is how I met almost all of my friends).

&gt;That being said, I fear feeling depressed over there.

Everyone feels sad from time to time, I'm finding that because there's so much to do and so many people around, it's easy to get out of your room and go and chat to someone, which makes you feel a bit better. 

Beyond that though, I've found that the university are very understanding of mental health problems. There's a counselling service which students can accees for free and also there's a NHS doctor's surgery really close by. If you're having big problems that are affecting your ability to study, you can talk to your tutor (everyone gets assigned a tutor who you meet up with twice a year (more if needed) to make sure you're on track and inform you about course choices in later years) and if it affects exams, there are 'special circumstances' procedures to try and alleviate some pressure. I've had to repeat a year because of problems with depression- they do require evidence from your doctor, but my tutor and the head of school have been so understanding. I've heard horror stories from other universities about stuff like this, but couldn't complain at all about Edinburgh. 

&gt;Are you enjoying the University overall?

I'm loving it. I had loads of problems in my first year, but they weren't really to do with Edinburgh. Now that it's sorted out, I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. I'm not the most outgoing of people, but I've got a fairly wide circle of friends and there's always something going on. I'm part of a few societies, that's great, and I love my course. The city itself is lovely, there's so much to do (museums are free, you can get to Glasgow in an hour for something like £10, Newcastle is close too, London is 5 hours away by train, you can get budget flights to some parts of Europe) and yeah, it's fantastic. 

I hope some of this helps your decision. I know how scary it is to be doing this (and I only moved 200 miles, didn't even move out of Britain :p ).

That's what I mean by restrictive. It implies that any indication of sexuality is, itself, a loss of power. Not that I think that the objectification of women is in any way empowering, but here's the difference: These women own their own sexuality.

They're not objects. They're participants, they're the actors (not in the theatrical sense!)

true,i4foot,EN,england,"Q:What have you made of your season so far?

A:Disappointing from where we were when RDM got sacked. Liked to have won some trophies at this point with the whole World club cup etc. Done better in Europe.


Q:What were your expectations of the team before this season started?

A:3rd in the prem, some silverware (club world cup, hold onto the FA Cup), Do well in Europe.


Q:Who has been your best player this season?

A:Mata. He is our Catalyst. Controls the game effortlessly. Also capable of scoring important goals. 


Q:Who has been your most improved player this season?

A:Difficult one to answer with the changes we have made with the squad and the overall season we have had this year. I would have to say Luiz. Looks less dodgy. Coming of age. Looks to be a leader on and off the pitch. Can also do a job in Midfield. 


Q:Who have been your best and worst signings this season?

A:Best signing: Hazard- Can be one of the world’s best. A long with Mata, he is a joy to watch. Worst signing: Marin-Hardly plays, and when he does he looks uninspired. Not good enough in my opinion. 


Q:Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?

A:Fellaini could do wonders for our midfield. Also recall various loanees we have including Lukaku and De Bruyne.


Q:How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?

A:A tough one. I personally don’t know enough about the situation. He seems like a mercenary. Wanted to leave, 
but wasn’t offered enough money from Santos. We gave him warnings, but he didn’t seem to care. He will probably just see out his contract whilst training with the reserves on ridiculous money. 


Q:In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?

A:Yes. It could be argued some of the players in the past weren’t good enough. Which I agree with. However, the current batch of youngsters are good enough imo, and when we get a stable manager (if ever) who isn’t afraid of using the young'uns, and then they can make quite the impact at Chelsea and their respective Nations.


Q:Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?

A:Lukaku and De Bruyne primarily. 


Q:Who do you think is the best player in the league?

A:Mata, Van Persie, Bale, Suarez. Take your pick.


Q:Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?

A:Very much so. I think our slump in form during winter wouldn't have been nearly as bad. Better squad morale.


Q:Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?

A:Look strong. Van Persie proving important, despite the slump in form. Carrick and Rafael also proving to be important players for United. 


Q:Do you think the point’s difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? How does this make you feel about United in general?

A:United again proving strength in depth. Something I feel Chelsea lack. I think United have done well this season but won’t be as one sided next year. The gap in quality is closing. 


Q:Finally, predictions for the game?

A:Not overly confident but still think we can get the win. Would like to mainly focus on the Prem to get a top 4 finish even though it looks increasingly likely so a go at retaining the FA cup would be good and less focus on the europa league. 2-1 Chelsea.

Says who? That's not been alleged in *any* of the handful of Muslim child abuse cases frequently highlighted by people like the EDL. 

AFAIK none of the accused were even religious. I'm fairly sure they didn't take time out of their kid fucking to kneel &amp; face Mecca numerous times per day. 

It is a deliberate attempt to spread hatred by titling this story ""Muslim rapist"". It has no bearing on the case. Why not ""Manchester United supporting rapist"" or ""Person who shops at Asda rapist""?

&gt;  were the crimes committed as a result of a negative view of women formed after religious education ?

For that to be the case you would expect rape to be unheard of among sectarian societies. This isn't the case.

Some men rape. It happens. They don't need a book to give them these urges and it's an insane suggestion that a book can influence them more than the hormones that are driving their sexual aggression. 

IMHO the single biggest factor on the level of rape in society is the risk of getting punished. Take a warzone like Somalia or post-WW2 Berlin, rape was endemic yet the criminals involved had nothing in common other than the fact they were human.

true,Bridgers,IT,italy,"1) It's been frustrating due to what has happened (Sacking of RDM, appointment of FSW, dropping so many points) and I'm still a little worried of the competition behind us in the table. 

2) After coming 6th in the previous season, I just wanted to improve on that and at least comfortably secure 4th. 

3) Juan Mata. Incredibly crucial to the team.

4) Mikel? This season I have realised what he actually does for the team when he's on the pitch, when in previous years I hadn't noticed. Maybe that's down to my higher interest in formations/tactics this year.

5) Best signing: Hazard. Worst signing: Marin. 

6) Not really a specific player but a CM like Modric would be great. 

7) It's disappointing (he was a great player during the 09/10 season), but he has been given the opportunity to leave. He would have been more useful training with the firsts though.

8) My heart tells me I want him to stay, but I'd also like us to move on because we'll have to move on sooner or later. 

9) I've not often kept up to date with the youth team antics before this year. But I'm certainly optimistic about the bunch we have now and hope they can break into the team once they have developed.

10) Lukaku and De Bruyne I'm sure can challenge for places in the team. Whether they can hold one down will depend on their performances. Haven't followed McEachran, Chalobah or Piazon recently but I think they will be able to soon. 

11) Mata. He can score, he can assist, he has a great record and often plays well in big games (like vs Spurs). 

12) I don't think he was the right man for the job. But sacking him was the wrong decision and especially replacing him with Benitez. (Due to the unrest it has caused with the fans).  I reckon the season would have been pretty similar under RDM.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"I think it's worth pointing out that not voting implies that you accept what ever decision is made by the people who actually do vote. So not voting is basically the worst thing you can do as you're basically voting for all of them. On the other hand, if you turn out to vote and spoil your ballot, you're displaying disenfranchisement with the system which is closer to the thing you want to do as your displeasure with the system is then visible and recorded as a democratic act.

I'd also like to point out that not voting is fucking stupid. In the European Elections my region (Yorkshire and the Humber) got a BNP representative because not enough people voted to drown out the crazies. People didn't vote and now we have to deal with a Nazi representing us, representing me. If you live in Yorkshire and didn't vote in that election, it's effectively your fault he is there.

Go and out and bloody vote for someone. It doesn't matter that you think they're shit. Just vote for them because they're marginally less shit than some of the other parties. Additionally, if you continue to not vote then politicians are going to continually notice that they get more votes when they say more stupid things like ""Let's kill the immigrants"" and thus adopt those policies. Every year you don't vote your making those three, and the heads of all the other parties care about what you think less and less.

So when you explain to your children why you voted for Cameron, or Clegg or Ed, say it's to keep out Farage and Griffin and who ever else is an even bigger load of shit. Explain to your kid that just because some one sucks, doesn't mean that there isn't some one out there who isn't a million times worse. You don't even have to care about the figure head at the top, it's the imperfect message that counts. Sure, Cameron might be a dick, but is policies have far less personality to hate, though you can hate them for entirely different reasons and decide that there is a relatively less shit set of policies to vote for.

What were your expectations of the team before this season started?

Who has been your best player this season?

Who has been your most improved player this season?

Who have been your best and worst signings this season?

Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?

Right now no.

How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?
He should've been sold or at least registered for some competition

Your thoughts on the Lampard contract situation too?

We all agree that he deserves a contract

In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?

We kind of used to seeing the young talents not getting chances but I'm optimist that in the future guys like Feruz will get their chance in the first team.


Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?

De Bruyne is the only player that comes to my mind. Maybe Essien. Piazon is a long shot too. Courtois shouldn't be forgotten either.

Who do you think is the best player in the league?

I can not answer this question (unbiased)

Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? 

We got used to seeing great managers sacked.

How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?

Maybe we would've been in the title race for much longer.

Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?

They are better than the last season and then they were 5 seconds away from the title win so the outcome of the season is obvious.

Do you think the points difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? How does this make you feel about United in general?

No. There is not much gap between teams like United and City/Chelsea/others.

&gt;I did say that there needed to be a movement larger than the anti-war movement in order to defeat the Government’s austerity measures.

&gt;The People’s Assembly will be the largest anti-austerity conference this country has seen. And it will, in all likelihood, call for further action. And those of us initiating it hope that it will be the springboard for a truly mass movement. But that is for the future.

If it was just River being overtly sexual I would completely agree with you. Like I've been saying all along, the problem is not that any one character is overtly sexual, it's when nearly all the female characters are overtly sexual. That's when I feel like the portrayal moves away from ""empowered woman who is also very sexually overt"" to requiring overt sexuality to be empowered. I think we can both agree that overt sexuality is not a requirement for a woman to be empowered. It's as if Moffat just can't write a strong woman character who doesn't *also* wear her sexuality on her sleeve.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"1. Disaster of a season in more ways than one. Transition is one thing but to alienate and annoy so many fans, under-perform like we have and suffer from problems due to issues that Stevie Wonder could have spotted back in August, it's all a bit too much

2. Related to the above, not great. I didn't think we'd embarrass ourselves like we did in Monaco and Japan but I assumed we'd be struggling for top 4 if we didn't sign proper reinforcements

3. Juan Mata, his consistent 9/10 performances have steadied the ship and got us out of a lot of trouble. Hazard has the odd perfect game in him but Mata really has been sensational

4. I'd have to say Mata. While he looked so promising last season, he has really stepped up to be our main man now

5. Hazard has a bright future ahead of him, it was a coup for the club to sign him in light of the competition. Honourable mention to Azpilicueta, looks a good player for £6m or so. Worst would probably be Marko Marin but he's the only signing I wouldn't call 'good', a surprisingly error-free set of transfers this Summer, just not enough of them

6. Falcao, Fellaini and a LW

7. Nobody knows the exact details. What is most likely is that the club told him he had no future here, offers were made but at a salary he didn't want and he's exercised his right to stay and collect a paycheque. I might not like it on a personnel level but it sends a message that the club is willing to play hardball

8. Discussed ad nauseum, including what may be described as a rant by me in a post somewhere. Again, nobody knows what's going on with regards to demands, offers etc. 

9. Sometimes the harsh reality is the graduates aren't good enough. We have Chalobah doing good things at Watford while McEachran has played for the senior team a few times yet is struggling at Boro. There comes a point where the lack of opportunities will hinder the Academy but then again, it's hard to give the kids game time if you're struggling to win with the First XI. As results improve in the future I'd expect to see more youngsters being given a run out

10. Lukaku, DeBruyne, Courtois could all have a big say in the future Chelsea. If Chalobah grows and learns his trade the way we all hope he will, he could become a big fixture for us too

11. RvP wins games and earns points, pure and simple. I was strongly in favour of bringing him in during the Summer and I had the feeling we could have if we'd moved quickly enough, once United stepped in with the increased likelihood of trophies, we were dead in the water

12. I don't think he was ever good enough at this level and with the pressure of the Chelsea job in particular. While he gave us the best moment of our club's history, he also failed to get us through the group stages this season, when relying on Drogba was no longer an option. Had he stayed on I don't think we'd be in much different shape than we are now, though. The problem we face is a lack of squad depth and fatigue, some of Rafa's more baffling decisions aside I don't think DiMatteo would have done much better, if at all

13. I've been to about 8 or 9 United home games this season, which is pretty common. Also saw a few Olympics games there and your second leg against Real

14. This is one of the poorest seasons in terms of quality for a long time, an opinion reinforced by the shocking display of the English clubs in the Champions League. While everyone is generally worse than last season, Spurs have improved slightly and United have all but maintained their level. That's been good enough to win the title convincingly

15. We'll win by a few, the feel good factor will return and Rafa will get a lap of honour after the match, as demanded by the fans... Or 2-1 to us",0,1364585232,null,0,false,0,c94sgwj,t3_1b95y2,t1_c94sgwj,t3_1b95y2,null,1431737519,31,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,31

true,AndytheAlbatross,1905,Hazard,"Me and my brother are both gonna be answering this collectively. 

Q: What have you made of your season so far?

A: Disappointed we haven't come out with as much silverware as i thought, though i was aware this would be a transitional season. A little disappointed in the huge gap between Man U and us.

Q: What were your expectations of the team before this season started?

A: Improve in the league to 3rd, win the FA cup, at least come out of group stages in CL, win the club world cup, somewhat expected torres to really have a great season. 

Q: Who has been your best player this season?

A: Mata for sure, has scored important goals, has loads of assists and controls the game. 

Q: Who has been your most improved player this season?

A: Probably between luiz and lukaku (even on loan). Moses has had a big improvement over when he was at wigan. 

Q: Who have been your best and worst signings this season?

A: Best: Hazard, Azpilicueta has also been a great signing. Worst: Marin, has sort of an insurance policy anyways, hasn't had much first team time but when he has he hasn't been great. 

Q: Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?

A: If Mourinho comes i'd like to see Coentrão come with him. We also need another striker and/or mid.

Q: How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?

A: I kinda wish he'd have just left but there has also been times when we could have used him in our squad (like during AFCON) when we didn't use him for some reason. So overall... *shrug* 

Q: Your thoughts on the Lampard contract situation too?

A: Sign him up, he is a club legend and his performance has been good this season. 

Q: In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?

A: In some cases I am disappointed with the lack of first team time for our younger players, but at the same time many of them haven't impressed that much. Our current crop does look more promising, however. 

Q: Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?

A: Lukaku and De Bruyne. Courtois could probably play in the first team, but Cech is still performing. 

Q: Who do you think is the best player in the league?

A: Typical Answer: Mata, Van Persie, Bale, Suarez, 

Q: Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?

A: Obviously I didn't like to see him go, especially with Rafa coming in as a former rival manager. Honestly, I can't say our season would have been better or worse. Credit to Rafa for making our defense much more solid but we really lacked results for a bit there. Recently we have been playing a lot better though. 


Q: Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?

A: I have seen about 8-9 games and my brother has seen about 12-14. United is a good club and definitely deserves to be on top with the way other teams have played this season. I think you guys have been fortunate in some your results with ridiculous chicharito and van persie heroics but overall you should be in first. 

Q: Do you think the points difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? How does this make you feel about United in general?

A: I think United has been consistent this season, something Man City and Chelsea really can't say. The fact that you guys have had a bit of luck, a great manager and have achieved consistent results coupled with Chelsea/Man City inconsistency created a bigger gap than I believe there should be.  

My opinion of United? You guys obviously are a great club and I love that you have tons of youth players in your ranks, something we hope to emulate. I wouldn't say you guys are better overall than us in any area other than strikers and next year i think we can really contend for the title.

true,socratees,null,null,"I do not see why it has to be class warfare. The background of politicians should be largely irrelevant to the quality or otherwise of policy. Of all things in politics I despise the faux intellectual criticism that often comes from the Left in Britain, attacking the Tories based on who they are rather than their actual policies. Noam Chompsky talks of the need for socialists and liberals to offer alternatives to policy rather than bemoan those on the right for what they are doing. Only then can they legitimately criticise policy.

I am no Tory apologist, and to be honest I do not appreciate the patronising tone of your comment. I do not lecturing on the importance of being politically aware. I am engaged in politics and read some malarky on the subject and try to meet every politician and issues with an open mind. 
It irks me that individuals like Steel attempt to smear the Tories but still support Labour, a faux socialist party which has virtually unrecognisable policy differences from the Tories. If Labour or the Lib Dems had advocated the same policies they would not be stigmatised in the same way. The Independent is meant to be a serious paper, but this 'satire' is tired and brings up the same stale ideas.

As for your points, you can hardly blame the rich for the mess we are in. They have just benefited from the system we live in and most people would do the same. The idea of this elite class deviantly controlling the masses is hard to buy. 

I completely agree of the need for change, the rich are getting richer and social mobility is falling. The structure of society is to blame. Our politicians have for too long courted the financial sector and neglected manufacturing and jobs that most people can work. There is also the issue of education, 7% of people go to private schools and yet over 50% of Oxbridge entrants are from private schools - brining these two figures in line would help to make Britain more meritocratic. Education is key, more money should be invested into it making our workforce more skilled- and it would only help our society in general.

The idea that taxes will make our society more equal is wrong, obviously they have a role to play but they will not solve the structural imbalances that capitalism creates. The government should nationalise a number of areas; rail, energy, agriculture etc - these do not operate as true free markets so should not be allowed to be run by corporations. Laws should be introduced making company wages scaleable, ie the ceo can only earn a certain amount more than the lowest paid employee. The government should stop wasting money on defence, we current spend over £40bn a year on it - this is crazy, we could invest this money back into the economy.

It's not like he's waiting for them to grow up and ripe either. He's never the one with the sexual intentions. Even when they do jump his bones he goes so far as to bring their fiances along on the ride to remind them that there're better men for them.

The little girl thing basically plays with our desire not to grow up. Our imagination and lust for adventure that grows somewhat dull the older we get. The Doctor likes the child part of us as if he's jealous of us. It's like when an old man takes his grandson to the park and watches him swing around with a smile. 

As for the women? Well, I'd say that if there wasn't a certain fascination with the Doctor, they'd be damn nuts. Of course I don't want to see another Pond that has to be reminded that the Doctor isn't perfect, but I really liked how the Doctor had to fight the urges of his companion, not of his own. Also, I think it's a fun little difference in personality between this Doctor and the 10th. 10th basically ignored his companions! They were just as crazy about him as all the others (except Donna, who I'd say is my absolute favorite), but he didn't even look their way. Rose Tyler he fell in love with as 9th and sort of stuck with it, but he never really did anything lovey-dovey. Rose might as well have felt as Martha did. Even when Mickey tried to actively compete with 10th, he did absolutely nothing.

It's too much of a stretch to say there's a sexualizing going on with the writing of this series, I think. Everything isn't about sex.

That the ideas are somewhat overused though. Yeah, I'm gonna have to go ahead and agree on that. The Christmas special made me think season 5 all over again, plotwise.

true,voilavoila,null,null,"What have you made of your season so far?

Better than expected, we finished 6th last year and won the European Cup by the skin of our teeth.

What were your expectations of the team before this season started?

Shouts of ""Its just like watching Brazil"" from the Shed and Matthew Harding end.  Its not quite that good but not far off it.

Who has been your best player this season?

Juan Mata - he is just a pleasure to watch.

Who has been your most improved player this season?

Juan Mata again.

Who have been your best and worst signings this season?

No comment.

Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?

Frank Lampard - 3 year contract.  Hulk as a new Centre Forward.

How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?

No comment

Your thoughts on the Lampard contract situation too?

Shameful, sign him up.

In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?

No.

Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?

I do not know.

Who do you think is the best player in the league?

Gareth Bale - it pains me to say this but it will hopefully make things a bit easier for us next season when we visit 3 Point Lane and he is in Madrid.  He is a great special talent and I hope he stays in the Premiership next season.

Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? 

No, he dropped Torres for Eden Hazard in our biggest Champions League game away to Juventus, it was a game we needed not to lose and we got thumped 3-0.  He also blew away a 2-0 lead at the Bridge - failing to get the defence and midfield's backsides together and sitting back at the efforts of boy wonder Oscar.
He was a great player for Chelsea, but was right out of his depth as a manager.

How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?

We would have finished 6th.

Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?

Great season - RVP is hardcore - so is SAF.  You can't write the Red Tide off - it just keeps coming.  A well deserved Premiership Victory awaits.

Do you think the points difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? 

How does this make you feel about United in general?

Good team and I think it is the Manager and his strategy rather than any quality difference between the players.  SAF just builds a better team than the rest of them.

Finally, predictions for the game?

RVP and Rooney sent off for Dissent, SAF sent to the stands for abusive language - chants of ""He needs a big fucking Whiskey"" from the Matthew Harding end and 3-0 to the blues.

In all seriousness at least 5 goals and a close game, strap in - always great games at the Bridge for Chelsea vs Man Utd.",0,1364589997,null,0,false,0,c94u1ou,t3_1b95y2,t1_c94u1ou,t3_1b95y2,null,1431736901,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

To be honest, there's a few things. The lack of nightlife is pretty irritating - we only found ONE pub open in the centre of town in NYE. ONE. This also extends to eateries too - forget your fine dining experiences, we've got Nandos, Taybarns, thats it. Aside from a rather nice chinese place we like called China Red there's no 'interesting' restaurants.

Secondly - due to the effects of the aforementioned Luftwaffe, there's no history, no interesting old architecture. Everything is concrete and brutalist. There's one street called Spon street where they moved all the old medieval buildings that were left to.

Thirdly - mostly a minor thing this, but theres one bus company that has a monopoly on the city and demands EXACT CHANGE. no exceptions.

I was skeptical that we could win the premier league with so many new players but I had hoped we could have secured a nice lead in the second or third spot. Also disappointing that we didn't get out of the group stages at the Champions League. I had hoped we could have gone a lot further this year.

3. Juan Mata is clearly our best player of this season.

4. Difficult question but I would say Mata again.  He's been phenomenal.

5. Hazard is a great signing and I think he will be even better next year. Marin has been unlucky, getting injured and maybe not getting the game time that he deserves. But I think he has not shown his true potential. 

6. We need a quality striker. Torres has not performed as well as he has been expected to. I think Cavani or Falcao would be great at Chelsea.

7. Sad situation. The club wanted to get rid of him, he wouldn't leave for less pay. Neither the club or the player won. I think we could have used him this season but maybe we don't know the full story.

8. It's a shame that he will (most likely) not finish his career at Chelsea. Emotion aside I think he would be useful next season.

9. Yes

10. De Bruyne and Lukaku.

11. Mata :)

12. I hated seeing him go. Maybe we would be in a similar situation, third or fourth and maybe we would have won the Super world cup. 

13-14. United are the most consistent team in the Premier League but not been great. I think the rest of the top teams have not been good this season so the title race has not been exciting. But full credit to Ferguson.

15. Chelsea win 3-2.

true,moobiemovie,null,null,"&gt;Assumption 1: Moffat continues to be Moffat… Throwaway jokes and ramblings become critical plot devices.  

Sure. I’m on board with that.  

&gt;Assumption 2: This current season will be the 11th doctor's final season. Lots of speculation points to this, I won't bother going into the details here.  

I don’t see how this is relevant.  

&gt;Conclusion 1: The events of S7E1 are their own paradox, in need of ""fixing.""  
&gt;Simple proof…Daleks refer to the Doctor as ""predator… Oswin… mak[es] every single dalek forget the Doctor's identity..[later] Daleks demand: ""IDENTIFY!"" to which he answers ""The doctor, the oncoming storm, the predator.""  

He re-establishes his reputation, but without context. I’m sorry, but I don’t see how this proves anything.  

The rest of your post proposes that Oswin was only ever a human in a teselecta suit disguised as a dalek. Cool theory, but there are too many continuity errors with your proof.  

&gt;She does not even remotely exhibit the most defining Dalek trait: hatred.  

When faced with the notion that she is a dalek, she begins an attempt to exterminate the Doctor with a rather vicious look on her face.  

&gt;When she saves the Doctor from intensive care by deleting all memory of him from all Daleks, she is unaffected.

Oswin appears to be the last bit of her humanity locked away inside herself. Safely trapped in a dream. Upon realizing she is a dalek, she loses most of her comforts around her (in her dreamworld), but she doesn’t cease to be. The doctor remains in the same way. Even if he were deleted from existence in her memory, he would still exist in her dream. My proof is that she is shown in flashbacks climbing down the hole to the core of the planet. She has creature comforts for over a year (including eggs and milk that never went bad). These disappear when the Doctor forces her to face the reality of how she would have such provisions. We even see her conversion in a flashback as “I am not dalek” becomes “I am a dalek.”    

&gt;Oswin has been alive for 363 days.  

Harvey  states that the ship crashed two days ago. This would mean that the daleks have been living with a terrorist in their asylum for a full year (363+2) before they took action. Remember, Oswin was messing with the automated prison for all that time, but she was capable of deleting information from the Dalek pathweb, or hindmind. This is a serious security threat, and it became clear after a year that the situation would not resolve itself within the prison. An outside force must be brought in to bring down the forcefield so they could “cleanse” the planet.  

&gt;Why can [a teselecta ship] not disguise as a dalek? Re-watch the Dalek Asylum episode with the idea that Oswin is hidden inside such a machine, and it'll explode your mind.  

Seriously cool idea, but if she is not a dalek, how did she hack the dalek planet? If she is a dalek, it makes sense that she would find it easy to hack, but the Doctor says it isn’t. Even he could never hack into the pathweb, but she finds that easier than finding the code to unlock her prison cell. Moreover, where is the crew to her ship? How is she controlling it? Where is she getting the milk and the eggs after a year?

I transfer GBP from my UK bank account to Transferwise, and they convert it into EUR (at a mid-market rate) and send to mtGox. The reason I do this, is because then a SEPA transfer will occur which costs less than a normal bank transfer and it's mainly next day. mtGox will only charge 10PLN to receive a SEPA transfer, but they will charge 1,000YEN for a standard bank transfer and it will take 2-3 days, maybe longer.

But you must be verified with mtGox to receive in EUR.

I don't convert to USD as that would be a standard bank transfer and cost more, but Transferwise can still save you money on that. Same goes for GBP, as I would have to do this via my bank which would be expensive, it's better to loose a bit on exchanging to EUR.

I'm happy to trade in EUR, as the market is quite deep at mtGox, and there is no real advantage in trading in USD there.

I have done the same with Bitcoin-Central; but the market is not very deep, and buying Bitcoins is often 2 or 3 EUR more than on mtGox. Bitcoin-24 charges no fees (unlike mtGox and Bitcoin-Central), but again, the prices are often 2 or 3 EUR more than elsewhere, so that outweighs the zero fee, and Bitcoin-24 charge a few bob for deposits and withdrawals.

Phew!

true,Rynoh,null,null,"I like several peoples answers but here are my feelings.

What have you made of your season so far?
The season has been what I expected, a true year of transition.  The club has done its best to alienate the old guard and make it clear that they need to move on when their contracts are up.  The goal all along seems to have been to finish top 4, set the field for a new coach to come in with little of the old guard left in the dressing room.

What were your expectations of the team before this season started?
I expected we'd win 1 or 2 of the easier competitions we were in and thought we'd make it out of the group stages of the Champions League.  I guess it isn't a surprise that we didn't since the team is stuck playing a formation due to it suiting Mata when most of the team would be better in a 4-3-3 especially our midfield.

Who has been your best player this season?
Mata the first half and Hazard the 2nd half.

Who has been your most improved player this season?
Lukaku - I know he doesn't play for us but he and KDB are the most improved players we own.

Who have been your best and worst signings this season?
Hazard without a doubt.  Azpi, Oscar, and Moses were all successful signings as well.  Worst is obviously Marin, that and bringing Yosi back from loan....

Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?
Fellaini and Benat.  I think Fellaini gives us a physical presence we are drastically missing and can give huge tactical flexibility with his ability to play multiple positions.  Everyone claims we need a deep lieing playmaker, this would be good, or you know we could push the defensive line higher and quit leaving so much space in between the lines.


How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?
FloMo got the shaft and I feel like in some ways it was to send a message to Torres.   As bad as our forward play is we could of used him at some times this season, but I understand why the club did what they did.

Your thoughts on the Lampard contract situation too?
I'm in the minority here but I think they are making the correct business decision.  He is currently our 3rd best midfielder behind Ramires and Mikel and we will be bringing in another midfielder this off season.  He makes to much money for us to keep as an accessory.

In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?

Not at all, if they are good enough they will make it into the squad, if not they will be sold generally for a profit.  Football is a business and the kids are getting a lot of experience, coaching, and exposure from Chelsea.

Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?

Depends on the decisions the club makes.  I feel we could sell Cech while he still has a high value and move on to Courtois right now and not see a drop off.  Lukaku is already better then any striker on our roster and KDB is an improvement over Yosi and Marin.  I could see Patrick Van Aanolt making some noise for left back soon as well.

Who do you think is the best player in the league?
Yaya Toure

Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?

There was never any chance of him making it through the season.  Roman wanted Pep, there was no way the fans were going to embrace Pep if we fired RDM to get to him.  Firing him at the first sign of trouble allowed management to appoint a manager that is so despised that the next manager will be loved regardless of who it is.

Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?

I've seen about 15 or 20 games on television this season, I think United is a flawed team but they have an extreme excess of talent up top that allowed them to overcome poor play in other areas of the pitch especially against what seems to be a weak premier league.

Do you think the points difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? How does this make you feel about United in general?
I don't think the point difference shows the gap in quality between the teams at the top.  I don't think Man U is the most talented team in the league.  I think they are extremely well coached and took advantage of the opportunities presented and didn't have the internal issues Chelsea and City had.  

Finally, predictions for the game?
I hope we roll over and play a complete B team and get out of the FA Cup.  With 4 games in 8 days I'd rather play our starters Sat, Thu, Sun and ditch Mon, I think Rafa will try to go for the win though and with our luck we will get it leading to more fixture congestion and a hard run in to stay in the top 4.",0,1364596536,null,0,false,0,c94w246,t3_1b95y2,t1_c94w246,t3_1b95y2,null,1431735827,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

I would think the main reason is that lots of ordinary, personal accounts are suddenly transferring relatively large sums to one, UK GBP bank account owned by Blockchain. This just sets the alarm bells off big, big time.

Plus, folks get their bank accounts hacked the whole time, and the scammers have to transfer the funds to a different GBP account and then take the cash out or transfer abroad. But what if they could just transfer funds to the Blockchain GBP account and then take the Bitcoins? Easy.

Same goes for all those eBay and Nigerian lottery scams and such like. They could do the same; and so could the VAT fraud teams.

Once an account is used even once for a scam they pull the plug on it.

Plus it's a little known fact, that if you receive a bank transfer into your UK account, the money is never yours 100%. The bank can claim it back months or even years later if they say it is fraud!! Another good reason for Bitcoins.

mtGox had the same issue with their UK Barclays account - transfers were stopped. At some point, you could even deposit in cash into their UK Barclays account (for a 1.5% fee), but they have stopped this as well.

This is why the exchanges are using Polish EUR accounts, as they are a lot more lax I would imagine, and if the transfer was part of a fraud and the transferring bank asked the Polish bank for their money bank, they would be told to get stuffed.

I'm afraid this is all going to get bigger and bigger as the crooks realise how they can use Bitcoins to stop the chain of detection when they are trying to launder money. Of course at some point they will just demand that all the drug users, clients of hookers, ransom victims and extortion victims just pay them in Bitcoins direct! Then they won't need the banks and will use www.bitspend.net to buy fancy stuff and cover their tracks.

true,antastic,flair5,,"Swansea plays an aggressively high line, near the end of the tenth minute Hugo punishes them catching the keeper off his line, scoring off a drop kick from the other half of the field. 

Bale nets a brace before the end of the first half, one off a free kick (fouled by Routledge 30 yards out) and one screamer after swapping wings with Lennon on a quick counterattack. Gylfi narrowly misses the target and shakes the crossbar with a thundering strike from 30 yards. 

Michu is visibly shaken up at the beginning of the second half and stays mostly invisible for the rest of the game. Scotty Parker starts thumping in ranged efforts for fun and eventually nets his first goal for us. Disco Benny sets up Adebayor brilliantly after a swift overlapping run down the wing - a crisp cross met with a powerful header. 

With a 4 goal advantage, AVB puts on Kaboul for a recovery run about. 89th minute Routledge concedes another free kick from range and Younes unleashes a hard driven screamer right to the top corner of the net. Vorm breaks a finger as the ball slips narrowly by his reach. Spurs 5,Swansea nil. 

Damiao sees the performance and finally decides to transfer to our club in the Summer Window, whose services Levy acquires for the price of Gallas plus a packet of peanuts from Virgin Airways. Bale signs a five year contract extension as the surge in confidence takes Spurs to a 3rd place league finish and Europa League glory. AVB personally lauds my lofty predictions and comes to cuddle me on my sofa while I play Football Manager under his tutelage. José Mourinho returns to London as AVB's opposition analyst. Parker starts to age in reverse so we can keep him forever, and Sandro miraculously completes his recovery in Brazil before anyone's expectations (he heals when he wants to).

It would also include the concept that policy making should be sympathetic to people's religious beliefs, but not informed by them. Meaning, in it's most simple form, that nobody should be forced to so something against their religion, but nor should they be able to prevent somebody else from doing something because it's against their religion.

I would also identify myself as atheist, I guess I'm just a very tolerant one. I think religion and other beliefs can be a positive guiding force for a lot of people. When you strip most religions down to their basic principles, they're just a guide to being good to your fellow man, and I think that's a concept we can all get behind.",0,1364603970,null,0,false,0,c94y6dt,t3_1b9rpl,t1_c94y6dt,t1_c94xth9,null,1431734828,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

...Not that that means you shouldn't go nuts. But keep things in perspective- this all *matters*.

(Beyond that- feeling like things are getting a bit much for you? *Talk to someone*. Too many freshers piss away their first year in a haze of drunkenness and depression- most universities offer outstanding, free, readily available support services. Get help.

Most Muslims will tell you that to take a life for any reason is a horrible thing to do, and goes strongly against God's will.

I think that ""all the bad things religion does"" are even more reason to teach it objectively in schools. No, there is not a scientific foundation, but nor is there to literature, art, or even history.

I think I'm a bit too live and let live to debate whether or not religion is in and of itself a good thing (and even if I weren't, it's well past my bedtime). But I feel strongly that a proper education on the subject produces more rounded individuals. Quite apart from the issue itself, it provides an excellent opportunity to teach students about compassion and empathy, to look at a situation from another's point of view and consider their feelings and *why* they feel that way.

Is a very common argument, but I think the problem is that if scientologists started blowing up schools, scientology would be banned because it is a small group. But because religions are so big they are seemingly protected.

Annoyingly there is a cartoon which sums this argument up perfectly, but sadly I can't find it at the moment. Basically a group of 4 modern peaceful muslims are holding up a massive cartoon bomb, whilst the extremist is lighting the fuse.

true,UndercoverFiretruck,1986,,"*What have you made of your season so far?*

Disappointing season all around. A few glimpses of brilliance but for the most part the club (on and off the pitch) has been a letdown. 

*What were your expectations of the team before this season started?*

Top 3 finish, the ""smaller"" trophies (Community, World Cup, Supercup), defend in the UCL honorably...

*Who has been your best player this season?*

Juan Mata, no doubt. The guy has consistently been the clutch of the team and we are lucky to have a player as capable as him carry the team through the transition period. 

*Who has been your most improved player this season?*


I'd say it is between Luiz and Azpilicueta. Azpilicueta was brought in as the backup for the RB position, but has now rightly taken that position from Iva. Luiz is still far from the finished product, but he is vastly improving his defensive game, adapting to the midfield when needed, and most importantly, developing into a leader.

*Who have been your best and worst signings this season?*

Best signing I have to give to Hazard. He started really hot, kind of cooled down mid-season, but seems to be finishing strong. I have no doubt he'll be a Ballon d'Or contender in the future, so I hope he stays at Chelsea forever. Worst signing in my opinion is Marin; not because he isn't good enough, but rather because of his injuries and the subsequent lack of playing time available to him. 

*Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?*

Either (or both?) of the Bender twins to strengthen the midfield. Lewandowski as long as we don't overpay for him, and the cherry on top would be a defender like Howedes. 

*How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?*

It's unfortunate that a player so vital to our 09/10 season success is now training with the reserves. I think both parties are to blame for, since Florent knew about his position within the squad and management took a nasty approach in dealing with him. I hope he finds a team next season. 

*Your thoughts on the Lampard contract situation too?*

On the one hand I believe that a legend like him should have a place on the team as a thank you for all he has done. On the other hand, he does seem to cause headaches for whoever happens to be choosing the starting XI that particular week. If he accepts a diminished role in the team, then I think it's imperative we keep him for the experience he can bring to our relatively young team. 

*In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?*

It is frustrating to see so much talent wasted, but I can understand why no manager has taken a chance with the youth. I wanted so bad for AVB to be the guy to finally start working with our reserves, but he probably handled it the worst (sigh!). I just hope the next manager has the support of both us the fans and Mr. Abramovich to do wonders with our youth pool. 

*Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?*

The Belgians have all impressed in their respective clubs and I hope KDB and Lukaku (aka Drogba 2.0) settle in nicely with the first team. Kalas has also impressed, so I would love to see him add to our squad depth next season. 

*Who do you think is the best player in the league?*

Baring all the controversy surrounding him, Suarez is an absolute beast. The guy has gone above and beyond for Liverpool, so I would not be surprised to see him win MVP. 

*Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?*

It's shameful that Di Matteo parted ways in such a unfortunate manner, but honestly it's all in the past now. Maybe we would be 1st right now, or maybe we would be at the bottom half of the table, it's impossible to say. 

*Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?*

I've seen a few matches and while I don't like the calls that United almost always gets, they've simply been the most consistent team. No one can say that SAF and the boys haven't earned the title this year. 

*Do you think the points difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? How does this make you feel about United in general?*

United have been the smartest team in the league, and that's why they are on top. They have not dropped important points and have managed to stray away from lengthy rough patches, and that's crucial. City and Chelsea had everything necessary to compete for the title, but in the end the team with the least mistakes is the one who'll be lifting the trophy. I'm not taking anything away from United, but hopefully next season all three teams play to their full potential and make it an interesting race. 

*Finally, predictions for the game?*

As for width from out wide, that's why I like having Downing in the first XI for the moment; he's coming inside, but he's still playing very tight to the touchline like a winger, which spreads their back four and allows Coutinho and Suarez to roam around.

The problem with the island is the cost of living is higher.  It's satellite of the London financial system and has a lot of wealthy people living there.  Average house price is £300k.  A pokey 3 bed semi will cost £200-300k depending on location.  Food and fuel is more expensive, especially heating oil.  Travel on and off the island is also eye-wateringly expensive.

true,loganonmission,null,null,"Honestly, one of the reasons I have considered moving is because I've just always wanted to live in the UK.  Canada is a beautiful country when it comes to natural beauty, but when it comes to history or architecture, the UK easily beats Canada.  Plus, I would take UK winters over Canadian winters any day (although the Vancouver area has winters very similar to the UK).  Plus, the UK just seems like a wonderful country, a place where I would like to live at least once.

Concerning your chances of moving to Canada:

* If you are or will be a resident: go to www.carms.ca (the Canadian Resident Matching Service) and look into the requirements for international medical graduates (IMGs) to see the requirements.  Most Canadian universities has residency programs specifically for IMGs.  Look at the eligibility requirements to register for next year's match as an IMG.
* If you've already completed a residency: there are many services to recruit physicians to Canada.  If you don't want to endure the harsh winters of Canada, I would strongly suggest you move to the Vancouver area.  Go to www.healthmatchbc.org and register.  They will let you know of the steps required to make your move to Canada, and they'll help you with visas, licensing, and all of the other preparations.

Canada is a great country, fairly liberal in our views, and people are generally polite and helpful.  As well, there are direct flights between London and most large Canadian cities (like Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax).  I would say that our infrastructure (freeways, railways) are all not nearly as extensive as you would see in the UK or the USA.  However, I love my home country, and can't wait to move back (I currently live in the USA).  If you would like any information about moving to the USA, just let me know.

Hope that helps!  Ask more questions if you'd like!

Edit: I just checked the eligibility requirements for applying as a resident.  It looks like it's almost impossible for a non-Canadian to get one of those positions.  Instead, I would complete your residency in the UK, then apply to the HealthMatch BC website.  By the way, there are many doctors in Canada from the UK and also from South Africa.  My mum's doctor is from South Africa, and he moved to Canada solely to work for about 15 years, save as much money as he could, then move back to South Africa with enough money to retire for the rest of his life.

The air is dirty, you don't notice it until you leave the city.

There's virtually no green, you usually have to go to a park to find it unless you're rich and live in an expensive area.

People bump into and don't appologise.

Tourists get to the tube station and stand right in front of the stair entrance causing a bottleneck that's bloody difficult to get through, then the idiots rush onto the train meaning theres no space.

The best way to start would be to get as much info and details as possible from your Gran. When he died in 1955, how old was he roughly? He lived in Suffolk, but was he born there? Does he have a middle name? Florence's maiden name? It all helps to get as many puzzle pieces before searching.

UK census records will help you track Frederick Bull up to 1911, although you'll have to pay to use the records.

Birth, Marriage, and Death records are indexed and can be searched, either on Ancestry.com or on the FreeBMD. http://freebmd.org.uk/ But that will only give you the index location, not the actual record.

Quite a lot of Parish records are available for free online, thanks to the Mormons - https://familysearch.org

Some WWI records can be searched via the National Archives site - http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/medal-index-cards-ww1.htm (I think most of the service records are now behind Ancestry.com's paywall) You have to consider that quite a lot of the WWI records were destroyed in the WWII due to Luftwaffe bombings - so don't be surprised if he doesn't show up on service records or medal cards.

I tend to get either ""You're very funny"", or ""You're not nearly as funny as you used to be"". It's like having a heckler. So if you were trying to draw some kind of logical conclusion from that, you'd become confused. It's almost like people have different opinions ... Whereas certainly female columnists automatically get a very hard time in the comments, so by comparison I get an easy ride. I think turning on reader comments – well, I say reader comments, it's actually an incredibly tiny proportion of readers, like 0.037% or something, isn't it, who actually leave comments – I'd say that enabling reader comments is the worst thing to have happened to newspapers since ... since the last worst thing that happened to newspapers. I think there's a Letters page for a reason.

we don't play with a box-to-box midfielder, which is exactly why Henderson is having problems at Liverpool. He is more suited to Sunderland, Stoke, etc. (that list gets smaller each year).

I'll give you one big difference between Gerrard at 22 and Henderson - Gerrard could tackle, and pass. Gerrard's highlight reel at that age was tackles, passes and extreme dedication.

i've never heard or read a footballer referred to as having 'poise'. Even if you mean composure I don't think you can refer to Henderson in this way. Gerrard rarely waves his arm at a referee.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;What have you made of your season so far?

Disaster was written from the very beginning, and it has been one. But, transition wise, it is good enough. We have enough players settled and working well, so that's the good thing.

&gt;What were your expectations of the team before this season started?

Was expecting second in premier league, and a good cup run in CL. As I said, it was a disaster written all over, so expectation weren't high.

&gt;Who has been your best player this season?

Mata. Hazard is also stepping up to be good, so is Luiz, but both of them are inconsistent.

&gt;Who has been your most improved player this season?

Counting all players, Lukaku. Counting only current squad, Mikel. Mikel do need to improve in consistency, but the improvement this season were great. 

&gt;Who have been your best and worst signings this season?

Hazard is the best we signed. Oscar and Marin are still working things out, so next season, we can expect them to improve. Worst is Demba Ba. He is suitable to the squad, but he is not a player to rely on. Plus his form is dipped way too much. 

&gt;Is there a player you'd love to see Chelsea sign in the summer?

I don't think we need strikers, as Lukaku is doing great. But, we should be signing someone like wilshere to add to our midfield, if we are to continue with current formation. Also needed is a central defender like Hummels to replace terry. 

&gt;How do you feel about the situation with Florent Malouda this season?

Not much info is available, so it is mostly a guess work. But, he should have been used in games, considering lack of squad depth. It is sad that he is not being used at all. 

&gt;Your thoughts on the Lampard contract situation too?

No matter the wages, we should keep him for a year. If we do not sign a new CM, he will be able to provide de bruyne, a good moral support. Keeping de bruyne and lampard in rotation will work well for the squad. Although, if we sign a new CM, we can let lampard go. 

&gt;In the past few years, Chelsea's academy has consistently done well in the Youth Cups and NextGen Cup, is it a source of frustration for you guys that the academy players in the past haven't been given the chance they deserve in the first team?

Yes, they should be given more chance. But, loan chances for those players were better decisions. Look at current position, we already have 4players ready to join first 11 on a weekly basis. If we had done it the arsenal way, it would have been difficult to win cups in last 2 years. Although, we shouldn't have loaned out essien, and lukaku. 

&gt;Chelsea have around 20-odd players on loan at the moment, which of those players do you think can make an impact in your first team next summer?

Lukaku, De Bruyne, Courtois, Essien. We practically need three players right away, to fill gaps in our squad. We need to start thinking about Cech's replacement too, as goalkeeper's consistency matters a lot, and Courtois will need two years to learn chelsea way.

&gt;Who do you think is the best player in the league?
In league, I will have to go with Mata. His consistency and performance has been great, and he has had results to show that form. 

&gt;Like the majority of Chelsea fans, were you aggrieved at the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo? How do you think your season would have panned out had he not been dismissed?

Didn't felt anything for RDM, but was pissed at this sacking trend. We wasted 2 years in transition, because of this instability. By now, we should have had replacement ready for Lampard, Terry and Cech. But, right now, we are struggling to replace drogba. Getting pissed should be considered normal. 

Although, I never had much expectation from this season, so RDM might have achieved those expectations. Good environment during matches, high player moral would have helped him too.

&gt;Have you seen much of United this season? If so what are your thoughts?

I only watch football on TV. Watched a couple AAA games of United, and the team seems to be relying too much on few players. Your youth squad seems to struggle to fill the spots. It is easy to notice the pressure on them. Although, form wise, your team as a whole is doing great. Your midfield is also performing pretty good.

&gt;Do you think the points difference shows the gap in quality between United and the rest of the league? How does this make you feel about United in general?

I don't think so. Last year the difference was negligible, and you have had only one important signing. RvP did made a difference to your squad, but current point difference is not a good measure. 

&gt;Finally, predictions for the game?

Being a fan of chelsea, I would love to see them win. But, given current fixture list, I think club will be going for a defensive game. It can end up 1-0 or 2-1 for any side, depending on the squad that day, favourable for chelsea being home side.",0,1364637347,null,0,1364637717,0,c9554v8,t3_1b95y2,t1_c9554v8,t3_1b95y2,null,1431731479,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

1. The Angel covers its eyes and is spotted by the Silence. It can't move, but doesn't remember seeing anything that could see it. For all I know, it doesn't think while stone. The Silence looks away, the Angel is unlocked. It touches the Silence, and Silence is sent back in time. The Angel recalls nothing of the encounter, but has to know it's absorbed time energy from something. Life goes on for the Angel. From what I can tell, time means nothing to the Silence. It lives life back to present day and continues to be an terrifying monster.

2. The Silence don't have eyes. Would their ""sight"" even count towards the Angels? If it doesn't, this would make the Silence one of the few things that can actually hurt a Weeping Angel. The Silence is aware of the Angel, but the Angel, having not been locked, doesn't notice it's been ""spotted."" The Silence quickly and efficiently dispatches the Angel.

To be honest a 2:1 in maths is probably a safer guarantee of a job in the UK, but Chinese sets you up better for a international jobs and probably a wider range too (and it's easier to get a 2:1 in Chinese). Basically they're both very good degrees with good prospects so go for the one you enjoy most! 

If you do apply for Chinese absolutely make sure you apply to a college where the AMES director of studies is a fellow in Chinese (or Korean, because Shin is a legend). There's a lot of inequality in the college system: my friend with a Hebrew DoS got no help at all because he had no idea how her course worked. Robinson, Churchill and Trinity are probably the best for providing support. (I'm at Churchill and really recommend it, our DoS is head of Chinese so we get lots of help and practice exams e.t.c, but it is pretty high-pressured, he wants us all to get firsts 'to bring glory to Churchill'.)

 - Private parking companies can no longer clamp you or tow you away. (The police, council and DVLA still can, however).
 - The parking company can chase the registered keeper if they can't establish who the driver was.

Sounds like the registered keeper has to pay? Not really. There's lots of things that did **not** change:

 - Private firms cannot issue a fine. And you can't dress it up as something else by pretending it is actually damages - you'd need to prove you've suffered £100 loss if you try chasing someone for £100. Law courts can issue a fine, the police can issue a fine, the council can issue a fine. You and I, however, cannot.
 - The usual way parking firms work around this is to say ""it's not a fine, you entered into a contract and we're trying to enforce that contract"". However, in order for a contract to exist, an awful lot of hurdles have to be cleared - 99 times out of 100 they're not.

Quite a few parking companies are starting to take people to court in light of the recent changes to the law, but so far I'm not aware of any court cases that have finished so it's hard to say what the outcome will be.

The only exception I can think of is if you get a ticket from DeVere parking services in Bournemouth and you live in the area. They have a tendency to take people to court and inexplicably, the local court has a tendency to find in their favour. This is an anomaly that isn't seen elsewhere in the country.

I don't have enough information about your mother to comment sensibly about her.

I struggle to see any grounds for objecting to this principle. The problem, though, is that as far as I know, no assessment is being made as to whether people like your mother need their second bedroom, it's just being assumed that they don't. And that is wrong.

I won't offer you any tips on the law because having just followed deadsoldiers link, it would seem the law is a constantly changing thing, maybe you had best have one last look at the AA's web site just before you go.
I can offer a couple of general, common sense tips;
Load your bike up fully and go for a ride at least once before your trip. Make sure every item is very secure. Wind speed will make stuff move around, be prepared to stop 5 miles down the road and have a look once more. You do not want your tent coming off and getting stuck in the back wheel. Your bike will also feel different when fully loaded, get used to this before your trip so that it is one less thing for you to have to concentrate on. Try some low speed riding, especially on loose surfaces. This can be the hardest part of bike control. This is the type of surface you could find when camping. Get yourself a side stand support, something that will spread the load on soft ground for when you park up. You can use a flattened tin can or even empty plastic water bottle.
If you are travelling with others find out which bike goes the shortest distance on a tank of fuel. If you are leading, be aware of this limit and not just yours.
Some of my other tips are made redundant by your gear (intercom, sat nav) I was going to talk about some of the hand signals you could use to pass information between your riding group. But you can just have a chat on the intercom. And how I would make road notes that I could read quickly through the window in my tank bag but your sat nav will do a better job.
Let us know some more about your trip, like; what sort of daily mileage, how many days, are you going to see something like the
Spanish MotoGP?

Even as a kid I always thought he seemed weird, but I enjoyed watching the program and what I still remember more than Jimmy Saville is the things the kids got to do:

A kid who got to see what his weight was in gold bullion 

A little girl who wanted to wanted to see her doll get operated on by real surgeons in a real hospital

To my (at the time as a 6 year old) perception, Saville was a bit like santa in that he was a quirky guy who granted kids' wishes. 

We all thought he was weird which was why everyone joked about it so openly before this investigation started, perhaps because we believed that there were measures in place to have done something about it if any of us really thought there was truth behind the jokes.

Then we found out the truth, which was terrible, though not so much of a shock coming on the back of so many years of rumours. The shock, I think, was from finding out that over the decades of his abuse of children, he *was* reported to the authorities over and over by his victiims and yet nothing was done about it.

true,BritMicroserf,null,null,"*Dusts off throw-way / alternate account*.

I work for a charity that helps people who're dealing with substance abuse issues. Most of the work involves ensuring people get access to the right services and information - details of programmes that offer services that might be useful, a directory of local companies who we know will take on staff with complicated backgrounds etc. etc. We also provide the means for people to buy interview clothes.

With regards to that service, we originally offered people Matalan vouchers to the value of £40 - £60, which was to be used to buy the appropriate clothing. However, that was changed earlier this year following a directive made many pay grades above my station, and now it's Asda vouchers. Typically a member of staff will run to Asda, load £40 onto a card, and pass it onto the claimant. It's also fixed at £40 - no discretion to add more, just a flat rate of £40.

{As a side note, our funding has been cut, the petty cash is usually running thin, and the organisation currently owe me £80 as there wasn't enough money to buy the last two cards we needed.}

So I have a little experience with a similar system. And to be honest, this move worries me. We give people a card that's supposed to be used to buy clothes only. More than a few will either use it to buy food, or sell it for cash.

The Birmingham council proposal suggests that the cards will have purchase restrictions imposed on them. That's fine so long as the list of items restricted is limited. What's more concerning however, is that it restricts people to buying their food from one store, and one store only.

More importantly, as /u/Herringgull pointed out - what if the gas meter you've had to have put in at the instance of the energy company runs out? What about the gas? A number of our customers recently had their water rates bills arrive - what if you need the money to pay that?

The social fund was far from perfect, but it offered flexibility. Welfare claimants, and people on low incomes will often times have to juggle their finances around - borrowing from Peter to pay Paul as t'were. 

More worryingly, if this ""trial"", when combined with the data from charities such as our own, and welfare to work organisations who offer similar discretionary payments via similar schemes, is deemed a success? You can expect an increase in calls for benefit claimants to receive a portion of their money via a similar scheme. No Government would dare suggest it be applied to those we all consider vulnerable - i.e. the sick and the elderly.

But the ""Feckless""? The ""Ferral"", The ""Work shy""? Expect it to be applied to them. After all, to quote the likely rhetoric, why should YOUR money be used to subsidise the lifestyle CHOICES of those who are a burden on society?

The charity I work for have already been consulted on a move that would see JSA claimants with substance problems have *all* their JSA paid onto a card, which would restrict what it could be spent on.

It goes without saying, we're against such a move. On both a professional level, and for most of us, on a personal level.

A: 1 - Because in a prime example of Government left hands not knowing what the right hands are doing, they have specified that councils and housing associations raise their rents to around 80% of the market value (determined locally). Social housing rents in central London have gone up by almost 90% in some cases. Many of the people in social housing are on housing benefit. Housing benefit goes up with the rent (up to the local housing allowance levels).
2 - by making cuts across the board in the name of austerity, many people are now less able to pay their own rents and are now claiming support. This significantly increases the HB bill. 90% of people on benefits are in work. The policies of successive governments have actively pushed up rents.

I am a big fan of both Brendan and Luis and if you read any of my other posts on various Liverpool threads over the past week or so that will be abundantly clear.

BR did not throw his theories out the window this season but he did have to adjust the style of play to accommodate the players at his disposal, for example his 433 has become more of a 4231.  It is very much to his credit that he was brave enough to adapt his strategy, and like some of the tactical changes he has made in-game to alter matches, speaks of his ability and promises much for the future.  In some ways you might say he is the anti-Hodgson (but let's not get into a Hodgson thing cause that's caused me a lot of trouble recently with bans from the Guardian comments section and things like that).

Having Saurez forces us to play to his strengths, demands that we are more direct and play the ball quicker from back to front than we did in the first couple of months of the season.  I think if you check out some past posts on Oh You Beauty you will see the stats and analysis to back that up.  

Saurez has been much better this season, certainly more accurate and more proficient in front of goal. However, if Saurez leaves, we cannot directly replace him and it will mean a slight change in our style of play.  I would be sad to lose him, hope we don't, but there will be life after Luis just as there has been life after every other great who has moved on before.  Saurez isn't Torres: when he leaves I won't feel he has stabbed us in the back, I will wish him all the best and look to the future.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"To be fair, almost the whole historical purpose of the COE was to dictate against the more extreme churches, hence the fleeing of radical churches to America. The British settlement throughout the age of religion has been that everyone believes, but doesn't really have to believe. In that sense the COE has been arguably been a secular (and also social) institution since its creation. 

Now that we're gradually moving beyond a period when most people believe in God, the influence of the COE will inevitably wane, but let's not blindly import American history. Unlike in America, we have both a high percentage of people who believe in god and in evolution, those views have not been considered mutually exclusive. Darwin himself found space for what amounted to atheism (or deism) while still being an Anglican, and the majority of our most famous scientists have occupied a similar position. It's difficult to argue the COE has ever been a serious force against secularism, or against science. 

Even in terms of social progress, the picture is mixed, the church is usually a force for social conservatism (about 30-50 years behind the curve), but it was also the major driving force behind the social reform movements in the Victorian era, including the anti-Slavery movement (William Wilberforce was an evangelical Anglican). As I say, American history is not the same as British history. The very confrontational attitudes in r/atheism are not just antithetical to our religious history, but also to our secular history.

Edit: I should point out, the place where this doesn't apply is in Ireland, where COE has played a much more divisive role.

The [Large Combustion Plants Directive](http://www.defra.gov.uk/industrial-emissions/eu-international/lcpd/) introduced emissions requirements for thermal plants bigger than 50 MW. It allowed those that opted out of the directive in 2007 [20,000 hours of operation to be used before 2015.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Combustion_Plant_Directive) The owners of these power stations want to use those hours for most profit - so with demand being high over the past year, they've been burning them fast. The potential is for there to be a substantial shortfall in capacity (as much as 20%) as they all hit 20,000 hours and shut for good sometime before 2015.

&gt; Darwin himself found space for what amounted to atheism while still being an Anglican

Darwin wasn't an atheist. He is credited for a lot of things, but he is not the founder of atheism. Its just that his theory of evolution was not in keeping with the bible. It's much like Galileo's round earth, he didn't mean to suggest there wasn't a god - but obviously it doesn't look great when a mere mortal refutes the word of god (particularly not in the eyes of the church). Darwin lived in a time when to go against god meant to be socially ostracised. He actually has references about god in ""On the origin of the species"". It may suprise you to know Isaac Newton wrote more books about religion than he did about physics. A lot of historical scientists were deeply religious.

The UK remains one of the few non-secular western states. Religious officials, unelected, can vote and ammend the law - it doesn't get more non-secular than that. I don't disagree with your point that the UK =/= USA. The US have their own specific issues with religion (which no doubt reflect the fact they are a nation founded by religious extremists fleeing persecution from European moderates).

Having said that, take a pew and a pack of Scampi Fries with your IPA and lets have a look at what you've got.

Ok, I'm not familiar with the north east of London, I never go further than Caledonian Road to be honest. Thought it was just empty after that. For Brighton The Evening Star's pretty good, as is the Hop Poles.

As for the London Eye - it's alright but don't do the champagne flight or anything fancy, it's a bit of a rip off on the standard trip but if you only do it as a once in a lifetime thing you may as well bring your own champagne! You might want to head up to the top of the Shard (which is higher) instead.

If you like pubs and you like literature, head to Fitzrovia (named after the famous Fitzroy Tavern), plenty of pubs frequented by people such as Dickens, Orwell, Thomas (who in fairness must've drank in every pub in London), Churchill and others. Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese was built just after the great fire of London and is London's oldest pub. As a Sam Smiths pub it's extremely well priced and has massive amounts of history seeping through the woodwork.

If you've not seen it, go to the museum district and go to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (free), then if you feel like it the Natural History Museum's pretty good too.

If you're feeling a bit flash, then walk from Piccadilly Circus up St. James towards Old Bond Street should take you through to Selfridges, which has vastly overpriced goods, but a nice selection of (albeit expensive) food in the food court (which is a strange experience as it's a very posh food court). I'd also recommend stopping into the Dukes Hotel Bar in St. James' on the way for a Martini.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;The latter part of his statement was clearly his judgement of austerity, like calling the colour blue pretty, it seemed a valueless opinion, as it stood.

Yes it was clearly his opinion, and the important part of his statement was that the moajority of the UK agree with his opinion.

&gt;&gt;Let's not pretend like you're not deliberatley misrepresenting his argument ;)

&gt;I'm not. Scramtek claimed that most in the UK oppose austerity, I disagreed.

No, Scramtek claimed that most people in the UK oppose *""austerity measures that make the poor poorer and allow the rich to carry on as usual""* and you took that out of context.  
He's not opposed to austerity measures universally (which is what you are implying), he's opposed to *austerity measures that make the poor poorer and allow the rich to carry on as usual*. There is a huge difference between the two opinions and there is no evidence that Scramtek has the former.

If I were to say *""I support austerity measures that eliminate our nation's debt, and I oppose ones that involve cutting benefits to non-whites.""* I would be furious if you then quoted me as saying *""I support austerity measures that [...] involve cutting benefits to non-whites.""* because you'd have taken my words out of context and made it seem like I said the exact opposite of what I stated.  
What you've done to Scramtek is almost as bad - you haven't misquoted him so it sounds like he's saying the exact opposite of what he meant, you've instead misquoted him so it sounds like he's saying something he's never said.

There is nothing in Scramtek's original comment that implies that ""Scramtek claimed that most in the UK oppose austerity"".

&gt;No, Scramtek claimed that most people in the UK oppose ""austerity measures that make the poor poorer and allow the rich to carry on as usual"" and you took that out of context.

It's a value judgement on austerity as a whole which paints it as being something which only harms the poor and doesn't touch the wealthy. Black and white thinking, a pointless addition to the conversation.

&gt;There is nothing in Scramtek's original comment that implies that ""Scramtek claimed that most in the UK oppose austerity"".

Yes but what he did say is so vacuously pointless that I trust that he wouldn't have said an idiotic thing. Good luck finding lots of people who strongly support the idea that we should fuck the poor as much as possible and let the evil rich people carry on forever and ever.

It's retardedly pointless, so I trusted that the OP would not have said such a stupid thing, and that it was a value judgement upon all austerity, and not just any specific measures which *objectively* harm the poor and let the rich carry on as usual.",0,1364658866,null,0,false,0,c958c09,t3_1b93za,t1_c958c09,t1_c9581t5,null,1431729901,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'll just leave this quote from a letter dated 1871 written by the incredibly intelligent freemason, Albert Pike. He was also correct about the 1st and 2nd world wars if you care to look it up.

*""The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the ""agentur"" of the ""Illuminati"" between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. 

Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.""*",0,1364660262,null,0,1364660866,0,c958os9,t3_1baqmi,t1_c958os9,t3_1baqmi,null,1431729733,-23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-23

true,TheBlackSheepBoy,lfc12,,"The issue here is what formation we play. First, I agree with you that, regretably, Alonso probably will not fit into our team with Gerrard's shifted position. What I want to discuss is the need for a DM.


Some of our trouble lately has been when we play a 4-2-3-1 with Gerrard and Lucas back, and four attackers (Coutinho, Suarez, Downing, &amp; Sturridge) ahead of them. If we line up like this, we are weak defensively, and could indeed use a Mascherano type. If we play a 4-3-3, however, we do not need that physical defensive player. Why you ask? Our midfield is balanced if we play Coutinho as our attacking mid, with Downing and Suarez on the wings (alternatively, Coutinho and Suarez on the wings with Eriksen in the middle... just sayin), with Gerrard and Lucas behind him. In this more withdrawn role, Coutinho can  help with midfield duties, with Gerrard throwing the long ball and Lucas focusing on defensive duties. 


Long story short, I think a lot of our problems of late have come when we Coutinho on the wing in a 4-2-3-1, instead of in the center in a 4-3-3.

Hell, if we want to attract ANY decent manager to the bridge, we need to finish top four. I give negative fucks about Rafa's CV (for the record, negative fucks means I'm pissed that he even thinks this is a job to bolster his CV with). Someone needs to punch him in the face and say ""you play your top side in the prem, and the other competitions are secondary."" That's it. 

* It's also painfully obvious how much our team relies on Mata. But the sub of Benayoun for Oscar made NO sense. Oscar was genuinely one of our bright spots (if we had any...) today, and Moses was really having a bad day. Why Yossi didn't come on for Moses, we will never know. 

* Ivanovic didn't do great in CB all day, I thought. Their first goal he let the runner go right by him, and he looked out of it all day. Honestly we could have used the energy and exuberance that David Luiz brings to the pitch today. 

* Overall I really only think Lamps and Terry decided to show up today. I have no idea why Rafa doesn't play Hazard from the start and then take him out at 60' to rest, as opposed to vice versa. Makes no logical sense whatsoever. I think when Rafa put that lineup out it was a signal to Southampton that they could go and get it, and to the Chelsea players about how seriously he valued this game (which was very little). Hazard won't save us every game, Rafa.

true,themancp,present,,"Does anyone else think that we need to start Mata, Hazard, or both every game? Without them, we have no creativity in the midfield. Yes, Mata was ill today, but you have to put in Hazard so we can take charge of the game from the get go and not play catch up in the 70th minute. I mean, look at the results when neither of them start.

That said, I was having a difficult time understanding why Rafa would not start Hazard. I realize that we are in 3 competitions still. For us fans, I would argue that getting 3rd or 4th in the PL is arguably the top priority. Yes, the Europa and FA cup would be nice, but not at the expense of Champions League football. The UCL is a higher level of play that will intrigue better players and better managers to come to our team. So as a fan, I would start a strong lineup until the end of the season as an attempt to get positive results. Not Rafa. He knows he won't be here next year, so he's just trying to pad his resume. It doesn't matter to him if Chelsea gets to the Champions League, or for that matter what happens to them at all. If he can completely sabotage our season with half hearted EPL matches to focus on Cup runs, he will do it.

To make another point, I am all for squad rest, but we do not have a strong enough squad to constantly rest the good players at every possible time. Someone posted that Marin, Bertrand, Benayoun, and Torres were all not good enough, and I completely agree with that. We have a number of young players who could run for days on end, and we should use them. I get the schedule crunch, but still.

However, we just need to be better. End of story. I can't wait for this season to end so we can get a new manager and recall our good players that are out on loan. KTBFFH.",0,1364663581,null,0,false,0,c959k35,t3_1bb4s2,t1_c959k35,t3_1bb4s2,null,1431729324,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

-----------Gerrard----Lucas--------------

Subs: (new GK), Kelly, (new CB), (new DM), Henderson, (new LW), (New CF)


-------------------------------------------------

I wouldn't bet on many signings that will come in and knock any of that starting 11 from their perch (I know Skrtle no longer owns the RCB spot, but do not forget he was Liverpool's best player last season.  If he finds his form I don't know many better, and besides, he's played at the club that long, and for a year in the system, so unless Williams, who knows the system, comes in, it's unlikely that a new defender will slot right in.  Most likely they'll be back up).  We will need another LB, but again, particularly if we're not in Europe, it'll be difficult to find a direct and better replacement for The Bull.  On form he's a beast.

A backup DM is an absolute necessity.  Lucas will need a rest.  But, nevertheless, not necessarily working on the same principles as the defenders - in fact, apart from Busquets and Kaheidra (or whatever), there are few DM's better than Lucas, so he will almost definitely start.  We would be actively searching for a back-up.

Alonso, if possible, is an absolutely MUST buy.  He would take Gerrard's position in the team, but Gerrard can move further forward as a result - Suarez could go out right and Gerrard could play the ATM role.  Gerrard may not be quite the same player as he was when Alonso was last at the club, but to doubt that he can still play that role would be folly (see: doubting his ability this season).  And besides, if he and Alonso do little more than take turns in cup/league games, playing CM, then that is still two dream-boat players for that position, which is what we need, for every position, to be competitive.  

Other than that, if we're not buying experience, I'd prefer to leave the spare CM position to be filled by Hendo or Allen or Shelvey.  We don't need another circa 20 year old CM.

Moving further up the pitch, a RW would be a good shout, potentially to replace Downing.  But on current form, again, I'm not sure we'd be able to find a better replacement who would be willing to come.  If we are talking about signing a number 10, then one would imagine Suarez out on the right and Coutinho on the left.  However, it is highly, highly, highly unlikely that Erikson will be at Liverpool next season, unless a starting position is offered, and we are in Europe.  He has been on a number of more wealthy and more successful clubs radars for some time, and he will be available for a reasonable price.  The latest rumoured guy, Mkhitaryan, looks like he would fit the pace of the premier league, but he doesn't look technically fantastic.  However, he looks fit and hungry, and that's the sort of player who keeps the competition of the group at the highest level.  If he can play wide too, as to switch positions with Coutinho and/or the RW, then he'd be a good bet.

Actually, I think Ben Arfa is a great call.  He would certainly fit the system, and although his work ethic is dubious, the deal, with a swap for Andy Carroll involved, doesn't sound too implausible.  Plus, he can play central or wide, and if we do play Suarez in AM then you have a line of three (Coutinho, Suarez, Ben Arfa) who can all switch positions, which is always nice.  

I think LW is an interesting position too.  I wouldn't like to see too many wingers brought in, as we have a number of players, including youth players, who can play in the cup games to give Countinho etc. a rest, and who could use some game time to keep them hungry (Sterling &amp; Suso in particular).  I think one winger would be more than enough to complement the players we have.  


As for the CF position: Personally, I still prefer Suarez there with another midfielder in the AM role, as it provides more balance to the team.  Liverpool control the game better when they have 3 CM's on the pitch.  However, Sturridge is a good player, and I think one more CF would be delightful (Man United &amp; City, currently 1st &amp; 2nd in the league, have 3-4 top strikers).  I would take Lambert any day of the week.  Talk of him being slow is one thing, but he is a fantastic team player; a great passer and reference point.  Yet more than that, really, Liverpool need another Sturridge-esque sniffer of goals.  A 'fox in the box'.  Who, at the highest level, is likely to come?  God knows...

In saying all that, a back-up goal-keeper too wouldn't go amiss.  

In all I think we need: a(nother) GK, CB,LB,DM,CM (if Alonso or similar age/experience), RW, AM, CF.

SO, in light of my not pessimistic (I'm confident that with a CB &amp; a DM alone we can challenge for the top 4) but realistic take on things, my starting 11 for next season doesn't really change from what we have.  Still, what I would LOVE (within the bounds of what I think *might* happen) to see is this:

-----------------Reina---------------

Johnson---Skrtle---Agger---Enrique

----------Lucas-----Alonso--------

I have to say I think Rafa is gunning for the trophies. He doesn't have much to lose if we end up outside the top four, and he's certainly got something to gain with the FA cup/Europa. He's not ignorant; he has to know that this would have been a different game if Hazard, Cole, and ramires had started. Not to mention he has to know that this game was extremely important to our top four aspirations. If the top four was his priority, he'd have played a full strength team. Instead, he wanted to rest some key players so he'd have a better chance of getting a couple more trophies on his CV. 

I'm all that has been said before, but I honestly think it's disgraceful. I doubt any of the fans would trade a top 4 spot for one or two trophies, but I'm sure Rafa would.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"To sum up my bone of contention with him: He seems oblivious to the needs of the team. It always seems like he buys good players without thinking about whether those good players are what the team needs right at that moment.

Henderson's a good example of this - sure, he might turn out to be quality, but for a team trying to return to the top 4, is spending 16m on a 21-year-old from a club of smaller stature and ambition, who isn't wanted by any other club at the time, the best way to use that money to achieve that goal? And Comolli will feel that if Henderson turns out great, then Comolli is vindicated, but I don't think so - you don't pay 16m for a player as a non-CL club and then get to declare the transfer a success when he finally establishes himself in the starting XI 3 seasons after you bought him. 

Carroll also fits this. Let's just ignore his continual support of the reasoning that ""It was OK to spend 35m on Andy because we got 50m for Torres"", and look at the fact that you've replaced an established world-class superstar striker with a guy who's been in the Premier League for half a season, has similar injury problems to the guy you sold as well as attitude problems, but most of all is almost the polar opposite in terms of style of player to the man who your team was previously built around, not to mention who your other big signing was meant to play next to. There was no thought put into ""who can we sign that best suits the way we play now?""; instead, Andy was bought because Andy looks a good player, and then we deconstructed a perfectly successful style of football to make the team work to Andy's whims. (I know there's been stuff said on Comolli's crossing metrics, and that's a separate element of stupidity in itself that he interpreted the data so naively). 

On an unrelated note, equally laughable was the fact that he thought Suarez &amp; Carroll formed a good partnership together, when there were zero signs of this - of the four forwards we had last year, Carroll/Suarez was the partnership that showed the least understanding.",0,1364664365,null,0,false,0,c959rvx,t3_1b6o4r,t1_c959rvx,t1_c9542w4,null,1431729222,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I'm pretty sure you missed out a ""not"" somewhere in there.

Most redditors are atheist, many to the point of anti-theism. While /r/unitedkingdom is not as bad as /r/atheism, it is true that it does have a slight tendancy to be intolerant of christians.  
You're being downvoted because you used the word ""persecuted"" which is rather strong and people are going to react to that badly. They read it and think ""We don't persecute christians here! Their opinions aren't banned or automatically downvoted. What a load of shit.""

You do have a point though - for example [the second top comment in the other thread on this subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1ban7z/christians_are_marginalised_in_the_face_of_an/c955ogr?context=1) uses both of those phrases, and the reply to it calling out that behaviour is tied at 0 on 26up/26down.  
What these downvoters don't like to hear is that they are being intolerant, but the truth is that they wouldn't allow heavy use of phrases like nigger, rag-head, chink, cocksucker, dyke, tranny, halfcaste and the like on this subreddit because doing so would create an enivornment that's hostile to people who aren't white and hetrosexual etc. Casually throwing around phrases like ""sky fairy"" and ""zombie carpenter"" is extremely likely to offend people who not only believe in God and Jesus, but also love them and feel loved by them in return; and it is more than fair to say that doing so is intolerance.",1,1364664556,null,0,false,0,c959tqh,t3_1baqmi,t1_c959tqh,t1_c956ij8,null,1431729198,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

its dumb to say he doesn't care about the PL, he wants to win as much as possible, its literally his job. i'm sure he doesn't enjoy losing. 

his squad selection wasn't that crazy, its going to be a ridiculous week. all of these players are perfectly capable of playing for chelsea on their day. ""marin should never start for chelsea under any circumstance"" is so fucking reactionary its ridiculous. 

there was a lack of urgency and a nonchalance about our passing, which doesn't come down to management, it comes down to the players. lampard looked terrible in the middle, stuck in two minds about whether to press the ball or stand off and just got caught out by sotons passing speed and movement. he looked out of place and should have been replaced at half. (personally would have liked to see hazard for lampard at half and move oscar back to CM to give him a try there to supply more.) 
 
what it came down to was soton played phenomenally, especially their pressing on the back 4 and the two in front, limiting us to long balls which is never enough supply with an aggregate height of 20ft(facetious) between our front four. its crazy to expect them to pull down headers all game and then mount an attack. 

apathetic performance that a manager can't account for. we've all played enough Football manager to know that 7 changes will never turn out well but there was no reason this team should have played as poorly as they did, and soton just capitalized.

Nasri deserved MotM as much as anyone, but I could also have seen it given to any of the goal scorers, all of whom had fantastic games. It was nice to see Kompany back and in top form. I think that game for Belgium might actually have been good for him, it may have helped him get back in form before todays game. I was also glad to see Sinclair get some time on the pitch, and I have to say I was pretty impressed. He had some nice runs, and that first shot of his was an absolute rocket, I was shocked the keeper got to it. Zaba continues to be a silent hero, he was basically playing as both winger and fullback in the second half, and doing a good job of both. A few times he didn't get back quick enough, but in general he had a great game.

Joking aside, I dislike this sort of scheme. As you rightly point out, it's a loan which is repaid and there should be no restrictions on whatever the necessity happens to be.

I can understand the discontent about alcohol and tobacco, but given no sane person would rationally apply for a crisis loan to purchase alcohol and tobacco, I don't really think the majority of loans of this nature are used for that.

More realistically is that people may purchase alcohol and tobacco which put them in a position of needing a crisis loan to fuel their house, but this scheme does jack all towards that end, but since there is a long term cost of getting this crisis loan, I think the cost to the recipient is higher than the benefits they get from abusing the system.",0,1364666673,null,0,false,0,c95aeq4,t3_1baktu,t1_c95aeq4,t1_c95a053,null,1431728923,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","It's an endemic problem - a lot of it is more to do with pub companies (they're seldom breweries) that own a huge number of our pubs all over the country.

AFAICT, the way it works is:

A lot of people have a romantic dream of running their own pub one day. Pub companies prey on these people. What happens is:

 1. Prospective pub landlord (who we'll call ""PPL"" to make things easier) gets made redundant from some job s/he's had for fifteen years or more, gets a payout of, say, £10,000.
 1. Our PPL has been an employee all their working life. They have precisely no idea what other things are required to run your own business - but hell, it's a pub. How difficult could it be to pull pints for a living?
 1. PPL looks up pubs for sale - and bugger me, there's hundreds.  He doesn't even need to relocate, there's quite a few in the same town - some of them selling for as little as £5-10,000. Fantastic - he doesn't even need a loan!
 1. PPL contacts pub company, who arrange a viewing. The pubs selling for £5-10,000 don't exactly look fantastic, but our buyer is optimistic - a coat of paint is cheap, and anyway, once the business is running nicely it'll be easy to afford to do it up.
 1. The pub company explains how it works - our PPL can pay his £10,000 and move in next week. £10,000 is a leasehold; he still has to pay rent every month. The biggest catch is he has to buy pretty much everything from the pub company. Booze, soft drinks, the lot. Considering the alternative is to scope out wholesalers for all this stuff and he doesn't have a clue where to start, this seems like a reasonable deal. He barely knows the going price for a barrel of beer wholesale.
 1. PPL hands over his £10,000 and gets started. Within a few weeks, it's pretty obvious he's out of his depth:
    - The idea of possibly offering some light meals has to be ditched. The equipment in the kitchen is falling to pieces and industrial catering equipment is eye-wateringly expensive; refurbishing the kitchen is going to be £tens of thousands.
    - It turns out the going price for a barrel of beer wholesale is rather less than what the pubco sells it for. There are regular audits, so you can't quietly buy beer elsewhere and just buy an occasional barrel here and there from the pubco to keep them off your back. Leaving our new landlord with the rather unpalatable options of ""sell beer at cost"" or ""bump up the prices to around £3.50-£4/pint"". 
    - Those light fittings he wasn't sure about? He figured it'd only cost £150-200 to have an electrician replace them, hardly the end of the world if you're spending £10,000. Except the electrician arrived, announced that the electrics were so bad he didn't dare do anything without rewiring most of the building and promptly left.
    - There's a whole bunch of other costs he was hardly even aware existed. Insurance, utilities, staff who need to be paid even if there aren't enough customers coming in to cover their wages.
    - There's a reason the pub was on sale for £10,000. During the week it's empty; weekends are little better. 
    - Here's an idea - get some live music in? Run a quiz night? Every single one of these ideas is going to cost money, and our landlord - having already been promised the earth for £10,000 and rapidly becoming somewhat cynical - is reluctant to spend any more. He's even more reluctant when the first time he does this he pays £150 to a man who comes in and runs the quiz and takes precisely £20 extra in bar takings.
       - This is mainly because our landlord did virtually nothing to publicise the quiz. The extent of his publicity was a couple of A4 posters he blu-tacked to the wall inside. 
 1. In a desperate bid to cut costs, our landlord sacks his barmaid. It doesn't help - for the pub to work as a business, he needs to either cut £200 costs per day or increase takings by £400 per day. 
 1. Before long, our landlord starts to drink. Just the odd beer at first with the regulars, but before long he's putting away £30-50/night worth of booze - £50 that he desperately needs to see in the till.
 1. Sooner or later, the inevitable happens. Our landlord can't keep up with the bills, declares bankruptcy and walks out. The pub company takes the keys back; they sell it to another poor sap a couple of months later and the cycle repeats.

This entire cycle lasts about 9-12 months, and this is how something like 70-80% of pubs are operating.",0,1364668135,null,0,false,0,c95asxt,t3_1bawbh,t1_c95asxt,t1_c9596ru,null,1431728736,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is an article about East London though, which has some very specific problems for pubs. East London (Tower Hamlets &amp; Newham) boozers, for a start, are now situated generally in the middle of immigrant communities who either don't drink for religious reasons or don't go to local ""old man"" pubs because those old men are invariably poor and racist.  
  
The saviour of the East London pub is going to be from one of two groups - students - of which I am one - or commuters. Students are badly served in London because beside their Student Unions it's pretty much Wetherspoons or house parties that are our only option, just because of the cost premium on any London pub. Even the cheaper local ones will be £3.50 a pint at least. That's the standard price for a Wetherspoons pint even, outside Central London where you're looking at £3.80.  
  
The other saviour, the commuter, is looking more and more like the main contender. For a start you have the overspill from Shoreditch &amp; Hackney, and the connections to Canary Wharf and the City in East London means that those commuters who do live here earn big money. This is why only the fancy gasto pubs with 150 types of real ale are spreading - because those who want to go drinking want the best.

Precisely what I'm hoping happens this summer. We don't have the distraction of searching for a new manager, FSG noted their mistakes from last summer (and hopefully learned), Rodgers and his staff - to me, at least - have proved themselves in the January window with Coutinho.

I think the other big key this summer is that Rodgers has his first year under his belt. All the administrative stuff involved with being the new boss of a massive club with so much deep history, moving his family around, transforming the medical staff, increasing his involvement with the Academy, familiarizing himself with the day-to-day at LFC in general, dealing with a silly reality show, all that is gone for the most part.

I would think this summer that he has settled in, for the most part, and that 100% of his focus will be on identifying the best players to bring to Liverpool. Bringing *his* players into the squad. And seeing which current members of the squad have passed or failed their audition this season.

There's a few places off the beaten track.

Firstly there's the Lake District. Not too far off Scotland and you can get away from it all for a while, it's got great views and it's certainly a place I would like to go (I'm planning to do some wild camping there soon) There's plenty of places you can camp or hotels. 

Then there's the New Forest. It might be a bit touristy but there's plenty of places where you can go and not be disturbed. Granted it's a little far from Scotland. But again if you've got the money you could travel down and camp or get a hotel. It's famed for it's wild horses and amazing countryside.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;... they can vote on law through the house of lords? yes thats right

No that's wrong, the House of Lords does not create, block nor dispel law, so they don't ""vote on law"".

&gt;26 bishops of the Church of England sit in the House of Lords.

So you'd prefer that their seats were taken up with other unelected people, people who are arbitrarily appointed to be party political and vote with the whip rather than ethics/morals?

Whether you agree with them being in the Lords or not out of principle; they're highly educated, highly moral people who vote with their heart and they're almost universally liked. So there hasn't actually been a problem with Bishops being able to vote in the Lords (in terms of influencing/affecting law), you're just mad that there are religious seats, well there are Jews and Muslims in politics too who presumably vote along religious convictions, should they be removed to?

&gt;But, on paper we are a theocracy

Who cares? You admit that everybody knows that this couldn't be further from the truth. Britain, especially modern Britain, has always been about that fine balance of maintaining a monarchy, a state church, tradition and so on and if I may say so; you're really showing your anarchist hand by proposing abolishing the Queen. You care a lot about labels and little about the reality from what I can see.

Who was ""the woman in the shop"" who gave Clara the Doctor's phone number?

Is this where Clara gets her hacking skills?  Is the Great Intelligence perhaps the beginning of the Dalek Pathweb?


Nice to see a few nods to the fans from Moffat too - after all the discussion about which jacket they prefer, he holds them both up before deciding.  The book Clara had was written by Amelia Williams.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; the House of Lords does not create, block nor dispel law, so they don't ""vote on law"".

Oh I'm sorry, I meant to say - they have the power to 'obstruct' laws. Pedantic much. Never the less, peers get granted seats to the house of lords because of their religion. I would rather there were either representatives of many groups (including all religions and atheist groups, not just COE) or none. I have no problem with the house of lords being unelected... but that is really a seperate point to this debate.

I wasn't saying I had a particular issue with it - i was making the point that you are arguing that the UK is a secular government and literally by definition it is not. Infact, the UK is a benchmark example of a western theocracy... with a monarchy and a religious body with exclusive rights over other religions to be granted seats in our upper house. 

Furthermore, I have no problem with the Queen - i didn't propose abolishion of the monarchy. I am infact one of the staunchest pro-monarchists you'll meet. I was making the case that the basis for our monarchy, because it has not been modernised in the legislation, is still one of a theocracy. This is **not** a secular state - although we are very close to being one.

If we could get those 26 bishops out of the house of lords and pass some minor wording ammendments to a few bills we could become a fully secular society. It will happen in the next decade or two i'm sure as peoples appetite for religion continues to decline... and the governments desire to cut the HoL down.",0,1364673609,null,0,false,0,c95cbgm,t3_1ban7z,t1_c95cbgm,t1_c95bix4,null,1431728023,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Personally I'm not Osmans biggest fan this year as he's just too slow and gives the ball away far too cheaply and often for my liking. Gibson and Fellaini were class as a partnership last year and it's sad that we haven't really continued it this year so I'd like to see it again.

I think Pienaar coming in will be interesting because as you said Anichebe would presumably be dropped to make way but he's worked so hard these last two games. I think it depends on if Mirallas is fit whether we continue with 3-5-2.

true,Fran1878,newcr-1,"Come on Everton, these are shite!","I was surprised with the 5-3-2 formation, but for me, it worked. I thought the plan behind that today was for Baines and Coleman to prevent the crosses, and if they did come in, we had three centre backs to challenge for the ball. However, I've wondered if this will be used again next week, in a situation where it'll be Baines Vs Lennon and Coleman Vs Bale, with three centre backs covering if one of our full backs gets beaten.

Besides that, today was a dull game, but we got the three points. The defence were solid, I was really impressed with Coleman again and glad to see Heitinga get another solid game under his belt (Despite the dodgy free kick!). Gibson's long range passing was off at times, but all round the midfield were good, Mirallas was creative and took his goal well, whilst Anichebe played the target man well again and hardly stop running. I'm just a bit worried about Jelavic, he was off the boil again and lost the ball too often for my liking, we still look like we're missing a bit of bite up top!

As for next week, I'm confident we can go and up our game. It'll be tough, but apart from a 2-0 loss in the Prem and a 2-1 loss in the League Cup, White Hart Lane hasn't been to bad for us in recent years. Hopefully, the pace of Coleman and Baines can deal with their wide men, whilst I'm hoping Spurs will underestimate the importance of Mirallas to us right now!

So in your mind it is fine for someone to live in an expensive house if they are properly rich. What you really can't stand is that an ordinary person has an expensive (not necessarily big) house through being lucky when they bought it years ago?

Why does it only apply to houses? Say an person used to like buying paintings from struggling students at the local art college, and now has a fine collection of early Hockneys or something, even though they are not wealthy. Should they be taxed on them, to make sure they have to sell them to someone rich who deserves them?

true,stubby43,null,null,"The woman being a child doesn't make sense, we know the bad guy is an intelligence that operates on the internet, the problem is Celia Imrie is 60 years old, born in 1952. 

So being generous lets say she was 10 when the computer alien took her that still means it happened in the 60's, even if your super generous and argue Imrie was playing a younger character in her 50's that means the alien intelligence took her in the 70's.

If you assume the character and the actress are the same age (1952) and the first network connection was established in 1969 it means she was 17 years old.

It was 1973 when the first connection to the UK was established making her 21.

Ok so lets assume she's playing a character that's 50 years old, born in 1962, given that in both phases she clearly has an English accent it means she lives in the UK, lets throw it out there and say her parents worked at the University College London (where the first connection was made) that makes her about 10/11 years old.

Then what? she's still an 11 year old girl, she's not in a position to actually improve the network, even if she was an adult there's no way she'd be able to do it on her own, baring her being a billionaire who inherrits a company specialising in telecommunications she's basically useless.

So what did the alien do? sit around waiting for the girl to grow up, helped her get good grades, encouraged her to go into the sciences and later computer science until eventually she gets a job at a telecommunication company and then maybe move over to a government project?

The internet went properly live in 1986 making her 24, even if the aliens turned her into a super genius she's not going to be an amazingly high ranking person because in those days it took a long time to climb up the career ladder and she specialises in something thats not widely available.

She only really gets useful in the 90's by that time she's in her 30's.

So what was the aliens plan? Capture a girl and wait for 20's for the internet to be invented?

Certainly I love what AVB has done, but that doesn't erase what Jol or Redknapp did for us.


Still though, a quick apologia for Redknapp: Parker, Adebayor (on loan when he did shit), Friedel (for free), Crouch (header beat City and put us in the CL), Walker, Defoe. Plus Sandro and VdV, whether or not our manager of the team at the time had anything to do with them. All of these players were signed by (under?) Redknapp and have had a large impact on our success in the past few years. Certainly, there are a lot of flabby buys on that list, but many of them are either still young or were bought to replace at-the-time problems. Nobody thought Saha was going to carry us to greatness; he was there to solve a (ongoing) problem of not having enough bodies who can play a 9.

Cardiff itself is very multicultural compared to most other parts of Wales.

We shorten the name David or Dave to ""Dai"".

We take this piss out of the English a lot. We don't really hate them (ok, some do) it's much the same as Irish jokes.

Nobody really fucks sheep. Unless your an inbred from the valleys.

Go travelling. We do have some awesome beaches scattered around http://www.visitwales.co.uk/regions-of-wales/coast-wales-coastline-beaches-and-islands/. And castles, lots and lots of castles http://www.visitwales.co.uk/things-to-do-in-wales/welsh-culture-and-heritage/castles/. It's also only around 2hrs by train to get London. This website www.thetrainline.com is your best friend for trains.

Hulu and many other streaming sites in the US just will not work. They can but it's a lot of messing about.

Welsh itself isn't really widely spoken in public, you might not actually hear a whole lot of it in Cardiff. But even most non-welsh speaking natives can all say Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Yes that really is a town in North Wales. Yes we can say it drunk. No, you will never, ever be able to.

* See some sights and heritage - there's an old mining town called Blaenavon not far from Cardiff and you can go down the mine accompanied by actual miners for free (plugging it since I live there). The hills around Abergavenny are great for walking.
* Spend a weekend in Cardigan Bay (when it's not raining) - we have some of the best beaches in Europe.
* Go to Dan yr Ogof in the Brecon Beacons, a huge cave system that you can explore (it was voted the greatest national wonder in Britain)
* For some culture, visit St Fagans Heritage Museum, or listen to some harp music - there's a big tradition of folk music in Wales.

Worth mentioning that we have our own language (which about 20% of people speak - me included) and all the signs here are bilingual - would be great if you could learn a bit.

true,inveigle,eng-merseyside,Liverpool Transplant,"My remarks were in reference to comments on a forum like this, particularly on the topic of religion and where the person being offended is an active participant or at the very least, a reader by choice. Similar for TV programmes, and video games and such. These are all 'opt-in' scenarios.

I hope I made it clear that uncivil behaviour to the people one encounters in day-to-day life in public is to be frowned upon and varies from ungracious to depraved, as in the examples you have given. 

When that commons becomes rife with this kind of behaviour, the kind of wrangling over what is acceptable and inoffensive becomes relevant as an exercise in democracy over a shared resource over and above simply seeking to censor those with whom one does not agree. Naturally, this does not apply to expression in forums and media where one elects to take part or observe, such as debates on gay marriage.

So:

If the two examples occured in a public space (as in the case of Wootton Basset), the majority I believe would be entitled to ask them to decist or democratically prevent them from acting in the first place, if they felt so inclined, so long as it did not breach their human rights.
