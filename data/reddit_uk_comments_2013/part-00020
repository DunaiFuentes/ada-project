Errr...they're relevant because we're talking about people who (for whatever reason) do not see the need to integrate and demonstrably do things to prevent it happening. Getting upset because I pointed the numbers out as an example is not going to change much, but I'd suggest that choosing a God that demands you pray five times a day is not going to put you at the top of an employment headhunter's list.

&gt;because you are already using them blind to other factors as a way to confirm your bias.

What 'other factors'? And by 'bias' I guess you mean not automatically agreeing with your assumption and providing examples and stastics that justify my queries.

There are plenty of immigrants who do very, very well - I'd suggest that this is generally because they adapt to where they move to, instead of forcing where they move to to adapt to them. If you're going to assert 'other factors' such as racism/ xenophobia/ etc. you'd have to address why these people succeed if they're all being kept down by 'the man'.

&gt;And that is the only bit that it's worth commenting on,

So you're not going to acknowledge that we are fairly restricted in our society about what we can and can't wear in real terms?

&gt;anything else would just be us going round in circles because of exactly the reasons above. 

You mean the reasons I just illustrated were incorrect? That's the danger with running with your own summary instead of asking questions. I've tried to give you clear and rational answers; you've mostly responded with assumptions, assertions and inferrences.

Much has been done over the last 50 years to eradicate homophobia; the average Briton is now much less homophobic than they were just a few decades ago.

Well, you've already pointed to Ivory Coast, Libya, add to that Somalia, Sudan, and Mali obviously.

And the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative which adds Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia to the list (though it'll be interesting to see whether and how the Arab Spring has affected that).

Which is why it's important to ensure friendly countries on the continent.

That is a fallacious arguement and you know it. 

Attitudes have moved on considerably from what you're talking about and this is reflected 

A)*By our laws*: our push to introduce specific laws (hate speech) which protect minorities (see recent arrests for racist behaviour on twitter) that is our society saying you cannot behave that way and you will be prosecuted for it and handed a criminal conviction which you will have to disclose for every future job you apply to - branding you a racist. 

B)*Further laws in the work place* introduction to work based laws which again protect minorities from discrimination. You can't walk around being sexist/homophobic/racist in the office. You'll either receive a written warning or immediate dismissal.

From these two brief arguements above we've determined you can get a criminal conviction for racism and if it was in the work place immediate dismissal and possible harrassment charges. 

You're arguement is fallacious and a distortion when democratic laws that we all voted for and agreed to be governed by, passed by democratically elected officials who outlined what they would enact once in office more effectively shows our shared values.

I welcome the fact that the Scottish National party has accepted the findings of the Electoral Commission, because the commission was worried that the question was biased. It is good that the SNP has accepted that.

""Lachien Du-pape knicknamed lachiendupape or 'Da-papay' is a recognized former Chelsea player ; born 30 January 1987 in Reading, England). Best known for his role at goal keeping and striker, he was often wrongfully criticized as not knowing exactly what his position really was as he would often hit the back of the wrong net while being the goal keeper. He spent the first decade of his playing career playing in the championship , most notably with Wolves, before moving to English side Chelsea, where he was voted Chelsea's best transfer for under £599.99 in 1999-2000 and Chelsea's greatest player ever to be signed under a thousand pounds in the year 1999-2000 in the list of those who made at least one appearance on the bench. He was capped a staggering total of 1 time for England when the manager was allegedly shit drunk and sent the wrong substitution slip to the third official,. After his short stint of a magnificent playing career he was confirmed as a mod of /r/ChelseaFC in 2012. 

An alarming number of people have hailed him as the best center back the Chelsea academy has ever produced due to his striking resemblance to the younger England and Chelsea center back. He is often rumored to take Terry's place on the bench and during promotions as a body double; Arsenal conspiracy geniuses have also claimed that he was the one who attempted the John Terry swan dive save in an international friendly and even celebrated the champion league win over Bayern in Munich as two John Terry's were photographed on the pitch at the same time, one in kit and one in casuals. So far none of these theories have ever been backed by concrete proof.

**Personal life**

An over achiever and role model in his professional career, he one upped it in his personal life. Soon after his playing career he graduated top of his class in the Navy Seals, and was involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda. He had over 300 confirmed kills (including friendlies). He was trained in gorilla warfare and was the top sniper in the entire UK armed forces. Perps were nothing to him but just another target. he wiped them the fuck out with precision the likes of which no one had ever seen before on this Earth, mark his fucking words. Kiddo's were dead to him the moment they questioned his superiority.

Agreed.  Being self-employed I can use whatever stimulants/relaxants I like any time of the day or night and there's nobody around to give a shit.  I find that caffeine and THC are a great combination for software design and creative thinking but alcohol is the absolute death.  Half a pint of beer and I lose all ability to focus.  It's not that I'm a namby-pamby drinker, either.  I love my beer and wine and drink a few units most nights.  Just *never* during a work day if I want it to carry on being a work day.

I guess it all depends on the individual, but based on my own experience I wouldn't bat an eyelid at someone in a creative/programming role sparking up a Camberwell Carrot at lunch time or during a coffee break. Similarly I've visited client's offices (also creative types) and have been offered a beer out of their fully-stocked fridge (next to the pool table), which I declined.  To me, having a beer mid-afternoon on a work day is absolutely out of the question, but it doesn't bother me in the slightest if someone else wants to crack one open as long as it doesn't adversely affect them doing their job.  I couldn't give a toss about the legality or otherwise - it's just about what works/doesn't for me.

Now, we can all largely agree about this behaviour being ""unacceptable"", but that's beside the point. As a democracy, our opinions will inform the law. The police are there to enforce that law, not make judgements about it, even if those judgements do happen to fall in line with the majority.

I don't know many times people need to tell you no one likes you because you're an asshole, not because you're a unionist.

When it was suggested to include part of Ireland I originally thought ""Uh, isn't that a bit OTT?"". Then more people upvoted/suggested it, so I obliged and it turned out quite well. No one else seems to have a problem with the idea. 

If unionists wants a bit of the UK included, speak their voices now. If the votes become 50/50, the option will be both included or none.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;That doesn't mean you can just creatively spell every word, nor completely reinvent the rules of basic grammar.

People (note, plural) can if they want to. However that doesn't mean they should or that it is in any way good. In modern English there's a lot less regard for grammar and a lot of people develop their own cleaks (right spelling) with their friends which some times kind of develops into a sort of dialect. They're fine to do it and they can be understood by their friends who they developed it with, however no one else can understand them. Which means it's bad. 

Basically what I'm saying is: People definitely can do what ever they want with language, however it doesn't mean they should. 

Personally I restrict myself from using Americanisms (if there's a British counter part) or from missing out sounds in words (""twen'y t'ree"" ect) as I know it'll make me stick out and not help people understand me.

Fleeing the scene usually implies some form of guilt. In this case it could easily be an indication of the possibility that the driver was un-insured, the car was stolen or some other reason that would cause the driver to not want to stick around.

Take the Tottenham riots; the guys setting use of force policy, prioritising areas and deciding what to do at a high level are ""gold command"" - the most senior officers (ie for this example the Chief Constable and his minions), under that is silver which is the chief supts. and under that is bronze - chief inspectors etc.

How about another smaller scale example? Firearms operations - say executing a ""hard stop"" on a car carrying 4 armed men. A pretty senior officer is going to be making the calls on that. Go / nogo, are armed officers needed? Marked or unmarked cars? etc

As for the murder investigation, if your wife were killed would you prefer that the investigation be led by:

1. someone who spent 2 years ""walking in circles around the pubs"", was trained as a detective and spent 3 years as part of a major investigation team, took the sgts exam and spent 3 years leading a team of detectives working on complex investigations, then did the inspectors board and spent 4 years running a unit of detectives before finally being promoted to senior investigating officer with all the courses, training etc.

2. The guy who used to run the best performing HMV in all of Sudbury and has had a year of classroom training.

true,nanakey,null,null,"I love the tram now, it was worth all the early morning roadworks and I feel it's had a positive effect on the area (Hyson Green), I know a lot of people who actually choose to come and shop here now, we have a lot of great Pakistani, Indian, Polish and Lithuanian food shops as well as the massive Asda, a market and a car boot. We had all that before but the difference is it's easier to access, a few elderly people I interact with at work (I run a city centre cafe) actually see getting the tram to Hyson Green or Bulwell as a bit of a treat and a break from the norm. 
It was also GREAT for when I was at uni (Trent) I could roll out of bed at 0840 and be in Chaucer for a 9am lecture! Now I work full time I can leave the house at 0842 and be at work for 0854! No bus can do that. 
The ceiling collapse was at a shitty rented property which we've since moved out of. The issue was when the tram routes cross over (ie the south route meets the north) at the junction on Noel Street there was a lot of vibrations as the north-bound tram sped across it and this damaged a few properties on both Noel Street and Burford Road. It was a huge vibration/noise, I still remember it ""BA-DUM-BA-DUM!"" So after complaints from residents the tram now goes extremely slowly over this join so its more a ""bum-da-bum"". They also ring their bells less incessantly which at the beginning was a major issue and made for a lot of disturbed sleep. I've grown used to the noise they make now although friends staying over still comment on the vibrations; I barely notice now. I hear and feel every time one goes past (there's one now!) but I guess its like people who live on main roads, they get used to it. 

Hope me blithering helped!

From my understanding, the compulsory subjects will be more specialised and/or vocational and *can* be a mix of workplace and college-based training (ie, the apprenticeships).

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"All modern day strains are essentially children of plants that are growing wild.

When breeding, you cannot introduce new characteristics but you can apply pressure by selectively breeding to produce offspring which hopefully express the characteristics you want more often. (eg. a more stable plant)

So the ultimate point is, if this new ""killer skunk"" has 20% THC, then it would have only originated from a plant that was capable of producing such THC content in the first place, ergo, the strength is nothing new. If there was 20% cannabis today, there was 20% cannabis 50 years ago.

Regarding the CBD content... that is complete rubbish. Thai stick was everywhere in the 60s/70s. In fact tons of it were being shipped back during the Vietnam war. Thai is a sativa variety. Sativa's have the highest concentration of THC in comparison to CBD. Some of it is so potent that it's not even like smoking weed at all, it's more like doing a quad shot of coffee. Anyone who smoked in the 70s will attest to the fact this stuff was really strong.

The problem with Sativa's is that they grow in the southern hemisphere where light cycles are roughly equal throughout the year. Thus they take their own sweet time flowering, sometimes upwards of 18 weeks. By comparison, Indica's grow in the northern hemisphere where their flowering time is much shorter, most will flower in 8 weeks.

people use methods like LST (low stress training) to grow larger plants in smaller area's.

One of our friends described his experience at the bridge something like this: ""The most boring match ever. A small barely audible group singing now and then. Everyone sitting down. And asian tourists at every other seat."" Now he was an arsenal fan attending due to his job so his opinion might be a tad colored. 

Same friend gave us the same advice you did, if we wanted to watch a Chelsea match with some feel to it watch an away match instead. Do the bridge have dedicated sections for non season ticket holders? I would imagine they could sell out every seat as a season ticket seat, or a bigger part at least, reducing the tourist ratio.

true,TerminalStar,english,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent","Yeah, what you're describing sounds pretty much what we'd have to do - albeit, our textbooks were a good source of information, so I suppose it's debatable how much we used computers to help. Having said that, in my experience, we were expected to type up that kind of thing, not hand write it. For my AS Level, I remember that a part of my coursework required me to research a certain topic, and then I had to produce a presentation such that I could give a talk, alongside my PowerPoint. Is that the kind of thing you mean? Because, for me, it happened irrespective of what we did in ICT, i.e. we didn't need ICT to be an applied module, it was a part of the other subjects themselves (not sure if it was with regard to the curriculum, or my school's standards, though).

I'm wondering if they simply mean there will be a bigger focus on programming, considering most people seem to have the mindset that Computer Science == programming. Not that I'd be too against that; I think it's a valuable skill. I also wouldn't be surprised if it might comprise of the kinds of things we only studied at A Level, such as project management, design of systems etc., just not as in depth (obviously).

There's no preparation you need, per se, simply a strong Mathematics background - because, as you say, there's a lot of Maths to learn. It is useful, however, to have a programming background (which, as I said above, I imagine is what the kids will be taught), and knowing about the more ""people-centric"" areas of Computing (such as UIs, human-computer interaction) would also be valuable; at least, I found it to be.

The biggest problem, in my opinion, is just how different ICT and Computer Science are - you really don't get the opportunity to study it before coming to university, which I think is a massive shame.

my grandfather actually said this is why he thought new builds were rubbish, ie. the architects often had no experience on a building site before they were let loose (he was a surveyor)

i personally think experience finding out who punched who outside some dive bar is a good experience before finding out who murdered who.

but they start at lieutenant

As much as an anecdote is worth, when I finished my GCSEs back in 2000 I'd say the overwhelming majority of the 200-or-so in the year went on to some kind of FE even then.

Divided between separate institutions, neither had anything to do with the other and no resources were split. Everyone wins.

So if there's going to be any flood of warm bodies into courses as a result of this, IMO it's more likely to be to the former and if your college isn't already catering to vocational quals and doesn't plan to, I doubt you've got much to worry about.

Cannabis can be detected in urine up to three months after use. Opiates, amphetamines and cocaine it's only a matter of days. I'd assume that management at workplaces (particularly schools and hospitals) would notice if somebody was turning up inebriated/high and take appropriate action, so I don't see why we need to start going down the same road as the US with drug testing. It's going to be needlessly expensive and will result in casual users of cannabis potentially losing their jobs while those using 'harder' drugs could avoid detection. And what about 'legal' highs and research chemicals, which drug tests won't pick up?

Yeah, my ex was like that. Finnish, often had work colleagues and even friends make derogatory comments about foreigners (her accent was...impossible to place, sounded like a mix of several different British accents) - but the fact that there are people with sentiments like that and the fact that the UK is attempting to avoid a huge influx of immigrants next year are not related.

This is pretty rational. We already have a large number of immigrants, we don't need a massive influx of low skilled workers next year, and highly skilled people can already come over here from Romania and Bulgaria. Literally all that's happening next year is that those who don't have any useful skills or education can come over more easily - it's perfectly sensible of the government to try and discourage that, and I should point out that negative ad-campaigns are not an original idea, several other countries have used them.",0,1359577788,null,0,false,0,c86g0k4,t3_17kp37,t1_c86g0k4,t1_c86ft9r,null,1431132303,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I ran to the neighbor's door, and told them that the dog had been hit.  I did not know them, and the woman appeared to be something of a shut-in or perhaps medicated. She looked at the dog in the street, said there was nothing she could do, and closed the door in my face.

I went to the dog and saw it still breathing, scaring away the other who were still attacking it.  I pulled the metal grate from my gas grill and slid it under the dog and drove to the veterinarian.  It died on the way.

They'll also need some serious firepower and economic and energy independence to keep out the religious types (I imagine American Christians would be the biggest threat) and various UN resolutions. Some sort of fantasy sci-fi Star Trek future land basically, it ain't happening.

Removing all religion from existing countries seems only possible by genocide, burning all books and religious buildings and purging entire generations, and whilst I personally loath religion I'm not prepared to start turning millions and millions of people into soap and fertilizer. Banning it won't work. Not even the Soviet Union could remove religion from Russia, and they were prepared to undertake murderous purges and fill mass graves, and had the apparatus to control every aspect of a persons life, all they did was drove it underground. 

The best you can do is educate and inform people, and hope logic and reason override any deep seated need for superstition and people make the personal choice not to believe. However, it seems religion is a meme encoded in human consciousness. Some people just need it. Fuck knows why. Even if every current religion was wiped out and a group of babies were raised religion free on an isolated land I suspect new ones would arise in short time. Not the ones we have of course. The isolated community developing its own religion argument is a great argument against the existence of gods.

Anyway, a huge ramble and massively off topic and hope it doesn't offend too many people and well, its buried beneath a comment with negative likes anyway :)

&gt;BBC America is co-producing a new mini-series for Dramaville, “Spies of Warsaw,” that will premiere in two parts on BBC America on April 3 and April 10 at 9/8c. “Spies” is based on Alan Furst’s acclaimed novel and adapted by Emmy-winning writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. “Doctor Who” star David Tennant and Janet Montgomery (“Black Swan,” “Entourage”) are cast in this thrilling spy story set in Poland, Paris, London and Berlin in the years leading up to the Second World War.
&gt;
In the mini-series, French and German intelligence operatives are locked in a life-and-death struggle in the espionage arena. At the French embassy, a decorated war hero of the 1914 war, Colonel Jean-Francois Mercier (Tennant), is sucked into a world of abduction, betrayal and international intrigue from the diplomatic salons to the back alleys of Warsaw. Mercier simultaneously finds himself in a passionate love affair with Anna (Montgomery), a Parisian lawyer for the League of Nations. Their complicated love affair intensifies as German tanks drive through the Black Forest.
&gt;
“Spies of Warsaw” combines historical, intelligent narratives, interlaced with flawed and compelling characters. The cast includes Anton Lesser (Dramaville’s “The Hour”) as Doctor Lapp, Richard Lintern (Dramaville’s “White Heat”) as Colonel Lessard, Nicholas Blane (‘”The Tudors”) as Papa Heininger, Julian Harries (“EastEnders”) as Duff Cooper, and many more!
&gt;
The production begins shooting on location in Poland in May 2012. The series is executive produced by Richard Fell for Fresh Pictures production, and Jamie Laurenson for the BBC, co-produced by BBC America, Apple Film for TV Poland in association with ARTE FRANCE and BBC Worldwide.

Also, targeting a couple of countries generates a lot of resentment from the population towards a group of people that already have quite a hard time getting their work permits anyway.

I agree with you, but there are a lot of people - sun reading plebs, middle class people - whatever, all sectors of society, who are utter idiots when it comes to tax law and how it works.

Bollocks.
Some crap parents already expect schools to do way too much. if your nephews Mum is crap, maybe you should have intervened and got the Social Services involved years back. 

My Mum raised me to be sensible with money. ADHD is sod all of an excuse. If his Mum is so crap and negligent, then I would be willing to bet money on her shite parenting being a co-factor in his issues. 

My Mum - a single parent who worked two jobs - managed to do it. I'm sorry your nephews Mum is a failure, but you're a failure as an Aunt'Uncle for not bothering to step in.
FWIW though, if I thought my Sister was utterly failing as a parent, I would get the authorities involved.

Rents are horrendous for anything other than a shoebox. If you want your own place, within the M25 you're looking at at least £1k/mo just in rent, so be prepared to accept a house-share to get the cost down but you're still looking at at least £650/mo for a room in a place.

Anywhere with good rail access to London is similarly expensive. Living outside London on a commuter rail line can cost more than being in central London if you work in London unless you get quite far out (Brighton, for instance).

Since OP mentioned being outside of London for work etc, avoiding major places with rail access is probably a good start to finding a cheap place to live.

A non-Brit once tried to tell an ethnicly Indian Sikh mate of mine from south London that he wasn't British - that was funny, my mate typified a London working class youth, fucking British as it gets. Being British ain't about being born in a specific place or speaking with the right accent, it's about making this place your home and adopting your cultural identity and values into the mesh which ours already is. Britain is just like it's national language (English, obv.) - a bastard entity created by a mixture of indigineous stuff mixed with lots of German and Norse bits ages ago, and now composed from every part of the globe, adding the good bits, sifting off the bits we don't like, constantly refining, undesigned by any overarching authority, lacking any coherent plan, and yet, naturally evolutionary, and...just...very effective.

You come here, you fit in. You take the culture of your homeland and mix it with the culture of your new homeland. British culture essentially just absorbs whatever you bring, and by that method you can be from any country in the world, celebrate whatever things you want to celebrate, follow the norms you want to follow, and yet, still do them in a British way.

Pretty awesome I reckon, it's one of the best thing about this country.

This was back when we had a bunch of dross from free transfers, like Voronin, El Zhar, Degen etc. No one of them wanted to play for the reserve team, even in the title, because they saw it as 'below' them.

Johnson, I can't believe what a difference you make on the pitch. NOW GO SCORE AGAIN. SERIOUSLY.

Sturridge, I like what I'm seeing. I really dug you blasting into them and making all their defenders glom on to you. Do that more. And do that scoring thing again. I liked it when you did that.

Downing, I take back all the mean feelings I've had. Well, maybe not all because I'm a mean guy, but I am super impressed with you. Be like you were in the first half, and you'll keep going places, kid. And make sure it's in to their box.

They didn't know what to do with your fancy footwork, couldn't fake anything past you. And if only you'd gotten that last minute clutch, it would've been pretty cool. I like you.

Enrique, you didn't have much time today, but that's OK. You'll get your hair back (read: gone), you'll get those chompers whitened again, and you'll start being a Beast again.

Refs, I think you did alright. You missed their clear handball and you gave Podolski too much leeway, considering he fell *so* very easily. But good job cracking down on Giroud and his antics, the ones that ruin the game if it had been Luis S, but are an unfortunate side effect for most others.

Woodwork, I'm glad to see you kept your stroppy nose out of things today. Unless you wanna sign for us and defend the way you did when you were on the wrong team this weekend, then you can just keep fucking off.

Gooners, I will admit respect for Walcott. He's fucking *fast*.

Holtby showed in 20 minutes the use of a player who is able to see and achieve the pass quickly, as was so vital when Huddlestone was at his best, and Modric/vam der Vaart also.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; So we should improve chances of job openings for 16 year olds who decide for themselves they would rather not go to school at the expense of student's education quality who want to stay at school and get a better job?

The majority do go into further education, back in 2006 this was 76.2% and rising. What was declining was the number who left school at 16 to work, leading to a rise in the number of NEETs. Since the financial crisis employment opportunities for school leavers who didn't opt for FE declined even further due to the number of people who had already had some employment experience seeking work. 

As others have pointed out, 6th forms are unlikely to become overrun with kids who are being forced to take pure maths A levels, so your yet to demonstrate how this will hurt your education or others. This raise is far more likely to result in more kids who might have become NEET's doing apprenticeships or vocational courses. Which is a good thing.

&gt; What does the year I was in at the time of the law being set have to do with this? Plus that does not mean that they are also responsible for any further similar changes to the law.

The law was changed with the Education and Skills Act 2008 (which post-dated the changes to 2015), and so far there is no public will to change it back to 16 (because that would be stupid). The way you phrased this submission gave me cause to think that you were blaming Cameron for a change in the law that took place 5 years ago.

And in all honesty, your entire stance basically strikes me as elitist without cause. You want a good education and fuck the people who you don't think need an education. There aren't jobs for these kids, and they are facing billions of people on the employment market. The only way out of this is by producing a more highly educated workforce.

The only racial 'no-go' areas that exist are in the minds of those who see them.

Some people have very accute, sometimes subconscious fears surrounding people from different cultures (particularly of Muslims, since they are the main target of today's scapegoating by media and state). These people will often look at a street which is predominantly Muslim and assume that they are 'no-go' areas for white people. They might even see an interview with an Islamic extremist who advocates segregation and then decide that is the majority view of all Muslims. 

I know a few people who are otherwise lovely but who are extremely xenophobic. It is very rare that such people can provide a concrete argument for their bigotry.

Agreed. I would argue though that there are many other non-religious groups that do still cover up things. Political parties and celebrities for example, Max Clifford appears to have been quite busy lately. 


&gt; However the scouts and football clubs now have checks and procedures to ensure it gets reported to authorities, and actively attempt to keep pedophiles out. Religious institutions don't seem to do the same.

To be honest, I'm not so sure it's as clear cut as this. I've seen a number of studies that showed actively religious people commit sexual crimes far more than the non-religious people. There's a general trend with all forms of crime (theft, violence) but the trend is most pronounced with sexual crimes. 

It may just be a function of lower average IQ but there is definitely some connection IMHO. Perhaps a response to growing up in an sexually repressive authoritarian environment. ",0,1359588073,null,0,false,0,c86jsx5,t3_17jx7o,t1_c86jsx5,t1_c86gzxj,null,1431134096,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,whistleflute,null,null,"Very much in agreement. I've said it before, but Dempsey would struggle to start in any of the top 8 teams. The only argument for him playing would be as part of 4-5-1 away from home in Europe deep off Ade up top where his 'energy' would be put to good use. He's far too slow to be a part of our counter attacks, and his positioning is non existant.

The one position on the pitch where heart and work rate is key would be a holding defensive midfield, which Parker has. I have to admit his distribution was terrible today, but the reason he kept turning back on himself was that no-one was making themselves available. Dawson's balls out were woeful as well which just invited pressure, or he he hoofed it over Defoe's head.

I sometimes despair over people's rose-tinted view of Defoe, he is like you say, an impact sub. People who call him a poacher and a goal scorer obviously don't watch the same Tottenham as me. In the 10 seasons he's played for us he's only got above 20 goals twice, hardly the form of a great poacher leading the front line. He never gets any assists, is woeful at taking penalties (bad bad memories) and gets the hump when put on the bench. He's a journeyman striker. Adebayor, who got 18 goals and 12 assists for us last season, was much more effective.

I swear Tottenham make a habit out of carrying very average players who score the occasional ""big goal"" that sees them though any critique. I mean, jeez, Jenas practically made his career out of those precious few goals he scored against Arsenal.

Two big points dropped today, Norwich had only taken one point from their last 18... and Arsenal and Chelsea drew.

The one and only time social services bothered to even visit his house was after he pushed his mum down the stairs. They were fuck all help before ('We can't do anything until he hurts someone'), during or after ('It was probably an accident, there's really not much we can do), constantly making appointments and then never turning up and never acting on any of our or his teachers concerns.  

&gt;My Mum raised me to be sensible with money. ADHD is sod all of an excuse. If his Mum is so crap and negligent, then I would be willing to bet money on her shite parenting being a co-factor in his issues. 

No disagreements there. She's a manipulative self serving bitch.

&gt;My Mum - a single parent who worked two jobs - managed to do it. I'm sorry your nephews Mum is a failure, but you're a failure as an Aunt'Uncle for not bothering to step in. FWIW though, if I thought my Sister was utterly failing as a parent, I would get the authorities involved. 

You know fuck all about him or me. Did I say I was never involved?  Who do you think he comes to when he's got problems? I've stood up for him when no one else would and despite having enough problems of my own to deal with have always made time for him and done my best to steer him through some seriously shitty situations when his mum and sister just walked away.

Randy has tickets to see Liverpool play on their next American pre-season tour. He's really excited and brags to everyone in town that he got tickets, even though they don't care because soccer isn't popular but Randy still rubs it in saying he's more cultured then the rest of South Park because he watches European Sports.

Cartman and the boys overhear this as ""You're a-peein"" sports and think Randy is going to watch some messed up sport like Urinal Swordfight Battles or something (half the episode is about the boys telling kids at school that they're going to see a legendary english team at some Peeing contest) and Cartman wants to go with him but Stan and Kyle aren't really interested either way until Randy talks it up saying it'll be the best sporting event they've seen and to watch out for flying balls because he has front row tickets.

They go to the match and it's Liverpool vs some Colorado MLS Team and the boys are disappointed as they find out it's Soccer and not a peeing contest but Randy cheers and starts singing YNWA with the rest of the crowd as credits roll.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Agree with most of this except the Parker paragraph. He didn't just give the ball away a few times; he gave it away to a pathetic degree.

Parker is typically a 90% passer who completes simple balls and keeps the team ticking. Today? 75% passing. That's like Huddlestone's typical accuracy except Tom is slinging them 50 yards and Parker couldn't complete square balls or simple 5 yard passes today. 

On top of that, he was dispossessed 5 times. The next closest were obviously the strikers (Holt and JD) with 3 each. When your central midfielder is giving the ball up more than your forwards there is a big problem.

Parker touched the ball 92 times which is excellent, but he conceded possession to Norwich on over 25% of his touches. By comparison, Dembele (who also was quite poor) gave it away on 12% of his touches.  

Shit, even Dempsey who seemed to fall over every time he wanted the ball only gave the ball away on 22% of his touches.

Parker is fantastic on defense and works harder than anybody on the pitch, however, he is nothing like a playmaker, which is what he tried to be until Holtby came on. He played extremely well defensively, but was terrible going forward. 

I believe that when Dembele and Parker are paired together, we're always going to have a rough time because Dembele is just a defensive mid with exceptional dribbling abilities in my opinion. With Dempsey in front of them, we have no one to link up play, and Parker tries to take on that role, which he tried to do today and was terrible going forward. If you don't think he gave the ball away a lot then we must be watching different games. 

However, when Holtby came on for Dempsey, Parker was much better. Holtby dropped deeper and brought the the wingers into the game, taking the playmaking burden off Parker. If Holtby plays in front of a Parker Dembele pairing, than I think we'll be great. If Dempsey plays in front of a Parker Dembele pairing, then I think we're screwed. 

Just so you know, I'm not disputing that Parker played well defensively and worked hard. He was fantastic in those aspects just like he always is.

You never stop learning; If you want to be a programmer learn how to program, if you want to be an artist learn how to paint, If you want to be a plumber... You get the point. Think of learning as a hobby; e.g. music, sports, hard core gaming, sex, if you don't learn to get better at these you probably aren't enjoying them. People love to learn; its what keeps us going. The worst jobs are the ones where you don't learn anything, you just sit behind a desk or next to a conveyor belt and do the same task repeatedly. 

The government looks at education like a production line which should lead you to think about why this is; they are funded and influenced by businesses that think you need certain skills before you can work for them and they want the tax payer to pay for them (fine, we have to remain competitive or whatever) but this should be basically irrelevant to you. Think about it like this; someone is paying for you, full time, to learn stuff. This is actually pretty awesome, but you get bogged down in the boring stuff like exam grades, who can kick a football the best, who's getting off with whom  and who has the coolest trainers. 

The question you should ask is: what do you want to learn? Also, don't worry about picking the ""right"" thing, you can always go back in later life, just pick something that you find interesting and challenges you; don't pick something dull and easy for the credits, you get lazy and it takes a couple of years of university before you figure out how to learn properly again (personal experience).

Tea allows me to pause for thought, sit down properly and not *do* anything for a short while. In my household, there is *always* a brew on within minutes of coming into the house. This isn't a withdrawal thing, it's usually to warm back up again in Winter/Late Autumn. Also, when I'm working I usually have one every hour and a half (give or take).

Most people in the UK drink a big brand of tea. There's usually an aisle dedicated to the stuff at large supermarkets, but most people buy black tea bags, one per cup. I drink [Yorkshire Tea](http://www.yorkshiretea.co.uk/), which in my opinion have the nicest blended black tea I can find. 

The main brands are Tetley, PG Tips, Typhoo, Liptons, Twining's and Yorkshire. Your personal preference is either 'I don't care', or 'I don't mind'. The 'I don't mind' is where I stand! A well-meaning Brit would never turn down a cup of tea made by someone else of a different brand, it'd be rude to in some ways.

I also enjoy other teas, Earl Grey being the most commercially accessible, it's normal black tea flavoured with bergamot oil; Some good Earl Grey teas taste like sitting in a garden on a summer's afternoon - delightful. I also enjoy green teas like grassy macha from Japan, smokey lapsang souchong and loads of others.

It's important to not again that not all British people like these teas, it's in the minority really. For 90%, it's just normal black tea with milk.

My tea (and mugs &amp; teapot) takes up an entire cupboard in my kitchen.

It is always made with milk. Whole (full fat) milk can make it a little too creamy, semi-skimmed (half fat) is what people usually use. I never put sugar in my tea. Builders are renowned for liking strong tea with loads of milk and sugar (as it's an energy boost), hence the term 'builder's tea'. I have a very specific way I brew my own tea, it's precisely the way I like it. This has taken *fucking years* to perfect, ha ha! I occasionally make a brew in a teapot, but usually when it's for more than 4 people all at once. The taste is superior to a single mug per single bag brew, but it's a pain to clean out etc.

It's also worth noting that in Britain we employ very powerful electric kettles (1.5kWh) to boil the water as quickly as the physics allows. This means that for two mugs of tea, the water is boiled in less than 60 seconds. Our electric National Grid was made to be 240 volts purely on the consideration that kettles could make tea much faster.

I live in a 'hard water' area, meaning that there is a higher proportion of naturally occurring calcium carbonate. This causes kettles to become furry, bubble baths not bubbly and water to taste different in the same cup of tea brewed 50 miles away. Yorkshire Tea have a special tea product specifically for hard water, but I've yet to try it.

true,paon-ecarlate,smith,Smith,"As several others have stated, it all amounts to little more than opinion. There is no objective truth of who was the best companion. Whatever resonates with you most will be the thing you like the most.

I, like some others, found Donna's departure more tragic than Rose's. Reason being, I have been a 19 year old girl in love before I know how transient those feelings can be and am inclined to believe Rose could get over it (then again, I wasn't in love with a Time Lord, so I am being a bit unfair and flip). However, the thought of being doomed to live a life of mediocrity and never being able to access one's full potential like Donna is far scarier to me, because it seems more immediate and possible.

Eleven was my doctor, because I like whimsy, fairytale-like elements and characters that protect children at any cost (in going back to watch Ten, I was alarmed at how often people, including children and other innocents, die). The idea of little Amy Pond waiting for the Doctor who never came broke my heart, as an imaginative kid who always hoped her fictional heroes would appear to save her, and so I was riveted by the idea that she had a chance as an adult to go on adventures with him. I loved Amy, boisterous and bold (retaining her Scottish accent in Leadworth) but also warm and loving (her tenderness with Van Gogh in the Vincent episode). Having grown up with an idea of the Doctor her whole life, Amy being attracted to and having love for the Doctor more than made sense to me. She had time to fill in the gaps with a perfect, impossible person. With Rose, I just didn't connect as deeply on that level, and that isn't really the fault of Billie Piper or the writers or anyone else.

I think an element of who you are personally attracted to also has a huge influence. I will be flamed for this, but having first seen Tennant as twitchy evil Barty Crouch Jr. in Harry Potter, I was just not attracted to him, even after watching his full run on the show. I still don't quite get it when people say he is handsome (not that I find Matt handsome, although I do find him attractive? despite lack of eyebrows and funny shaped head). I found Billie beautiful, but also not my type. So watching Ten/Rose's on-screen chemistry was not as engaging for me as I think it was for others who a) got to see them when they were both relatively unknown, the same way I was able to experience Matt and Karen for the first time without any other external influences on my viewing and b) were physically attracted to the both of them on some level.

I loved Martha for her strength, intelligence and independence. It takes guts to walk away from the Doctor, particularly when you are in love with him. The same people who understand so acutely Rose's being in love with him often bash Martha for the same exact thing just because it is explicitly unrequited. I'm surprised and dismayed more Whovians didn't relate to her. Many people who don't like Amy like Rory, or like them better as a pair, while I don't care for Rory personally although I appreciate his character. I preferred episodes without him. He was a redeeming character for people who didn't like certain aspects of Amy, which I can understand. I like River Song a lot, but at times I just am not all that into her relationship with the Doctor. I could go on and on...

Basically, there's no right and wrong. There's only what has meaning and impact to you. Just embrace what you love and the people who love it like you do, and let's all not waste time bashing one another for our personal preferences. I think that's why people get so angry and defensive: we find in Doctor Who things that are also true in ourselves and feel personally attacked when the characters we love and relate to most are bashed.

**tl;dr Everyone gets out of Doctor Who what they go into it with and our favorite characters tend to be ones that we relate to and/or that we are attracted to on some level, whether it be physical or otherwise.

I was ribbing British emigrants for not being Spanish enough, but should they really adopt these stereotypical, unrepresentative Spanish values?

true,scg30,1953,Frank Lampard,"Don't get me wrong. I didn't mean to give the impression that I don't rate Bertrand very highly, I do. Just not quite as highly, (as it seems from reading your comments), that you do. 

I think he is a very good young player with **tons** of potential who has shown he can rise to the occasion in a supporting role. But I wouldn't go any further than that. I think he has a way to go before becoming a truly *fantastic* player.

The experience point is an interesting one. On the one hand, yes Bertrand's experience is a big plus, and surely any manager would look favorably upon that. However, I don't see it as any kind of trump card when competing for a squad berth in training. 

He has consistently put in good shifts with the first team never more importantly than in Munich, but the fate of that match, and most that he appears in, have hardly hinged on his sole contribution. Now, football is a team sport after all, so I only bring this up to highlight that Bertrand's 'experience bonus' doesn't exactly translate to 'proven match-winner' or anything. 

Also, he only ever gained the European and League experience he has because a manager was willing to take a chance on him and give him the opportunity to prove himself, so it doesn't stand to reason that any future manager would be patently unwilling to give that same chance to another young and as of yet unproven player if they thought they had shown enough in training to justify it.

That's all I would like; a chance for VA to earn the opportunity to prove himself the same way Ryan did. I agree with you, and I would guess most supporters, that right now Ryan is probably the better and more reliable option, I think that's the reasonably clear consensus. All I'm saying is that next season I would be excited if the club gave VA a prolonged shot at proving us all wrong.

I agree with you on squad rotation, so much so in fact that I think it might be good for all involved (A. Cole, Bertrand, and Van Aanholt) to be competing for the LB spot across 4 competitions next season, especially since Bertrand has been shown capable of operating in a more advanced midfield role and Ash needs to rest his ankle now and again.",0,1359609381,null,0,false,0,c86qnbt,t3_17ig3j,t1_c86qnbt,t1_c86f742,null,1431137371,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,throwaway12345564,null,null,"Using a throwaway in case any of this lands me in hot water - you can never be too sure!

I'll lay my cards on the table straight away - I'm an IT teacher (head of IT at a very good school down south), but my degree is Computer Science and I used to work as a programmer and then as a junior Database Admin before coming into teaching. I think the push towards Computing is absolutely brilliant; in an ideal world, every kid in the land would be given the chance to do it as Gove wants.

However, the reality is very different. I've delivered A Level Computing for nigh on 15 years and GCSE Computing for 2 years, but during that  time some stark truths have hit home. The first is that a lot of ICT teachers just aren't interested in Computing in any way, shape or form. My department has me (who teaches ALL of the Computing load at the minute), a business studies graduate, a fine-arts graduate and an ex-PE teacher. They're very happy teaching kids about spreadsheets and e-mail, but the thought of binary-to-hexadecimal conversion scares the shit out of them. The same is true at other schools, because I go to regional IT events, where 75%+ of the attendees moan like crazy about the introduction of Computing because they simply don't get it. As much as Gove would like to, you can't replace thousands of teachers in one go, so what will be the result? Schools ignoring it or schools pushing teachers with no interest of subject knowledge to teach it? Which is worst?

Second, a lot of students just aren't interested. I got a brilliant response to the idea when I launched GCSE Computing, but I also got a significant number who have their career paths set in their minds and WANT a good grounding in basic IT skills. To them, being able to set up a website and keep a database of staff is much more important to them than learning about algorithms.

Third, outside influences are creeping in far too much for my liking; Google seem to have a huge role in this and I worry that a general grounding in Computing will eventually be replaced by a programme of study that prepares students to work at Google.  I know the two *could* be very similar, but business and education don't always mix.

Linked to this, people who have never worked in schools generally set the bar at much too high a level - both in breadth and depth. You have to understand that a GCSE in Computing will be done by 14/15 year olds who will never had any formal Computing lessons before. Their ICT lessons have been filled with Powerpoint and WordArt, to suddenly ask them to solve abstract problems with tools that they've never used is a giant leap - there has to be content that is saved for A Level, and then more to save for degree level. Has anyone looked at the GCSE specs from any of the exam boards? It doesn't match with the comments below.

I'm rambling anyway - I'll stop now.

TL;DR - I'm an ICT teacher with a Computing background, the idea is great but large swathes of teachers are not interested / incapable of delivering. Outsiders also expect far too much from 14 year olds.

So whilst I enjoyed the RTD era (Well I actually gave up on the show mid series 4 and took til the specials to go back and watch them as I hated that arrogant girl following around a 900 year old alien and trying to say she knows better than him and disobeys him all the time), I was more than ready for a fresh set of eyes to look at the show through, and Moffat performed this amazingly, gone were all the silly restraints on time and how you can't use the TARDIS for anything else but flying to the next episode (yes I know he used it for stuff like towing the Earth back to where it should be, man RTD must've really written himself into a corner that day) and here we are in this amazing era where all the restraints are gone and we aren't caught up on making sure there aren't any dumb plot holes.

It's just more magical I find, I can see why some people would want much more explainable and less ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey"" but I love it way more than I love the Doctor spouting out a really fast spoken line about the 500 reasons the plot has to stay grounded in reality.

Q: Do we know JJ, bentley and Andros (loan) all to QPR?

&gt;JJ and DB permanent

Jasper

&gt;Regardless of what AVB says in public we are still trying for a striker out of 3/4 options, the problem is our method and terms for obvious reasons as we ideally want loans with view to summer permanents, and unless something different has happened Diame's people are pushing him goons way as his first choice, but we still trying on that one. Couple more options which are loan options. 

&gt;Who really knows what will happen, and BTW there is truth in Son (cant see it) and Negredo. We inquired about Hooper with a aim to find out what their price would be and no movement there. Love a big surprise but cannot see it at all. 

&gt;It seems that Hudd would rather another club than Fulham, but let us see.

JJetset:

&gt;DL is clearing the decks as he says we have a lack of money. The boys to QPR are going cheaper than cheap and are better than what they have. H can trust them apparently!

&gt;Now there is 2 ways to look at the clearing the decks scenario:

&gt;1. We genuinely are skint and have to balance the books as we have no money as DL keeps saying?

&gt;2.He is clearing the decks for an impending arrival or arrivals?

&gt;You go with whatever you want for tomorrow depending on what floats your boat, or if you are a glass half full or half empty....

Gards:

Q: any chance of David Villa?

&gt;unsure! We have had talks with a striker today

Q: How many will come in?

Q: what would you say % of someone coming in is?

There is a reason Highbury was known as ""The Library"" - the new stadium is little better. When you amplify nothing you still have....nothing.....

For him to have a ticket as an Arsenal fan tells me that most likely he either got a ticket in a general sale area, or as a guest in a hospitality area. And he was surprised at lack of atmosphere in that section and number of tourists? Who'da thunk it?

I would agree that atmosphere is something that is difficult to get a handle on. Poor performances are less likely to inspire fervour. The days of the crowd lifting the performance of the team at times when they are playing shit are receding - mainly because the demographic of the attendees is changing - age, cost, availability - all of those things talked about elsewhere.

By definition away support IS going to be more dedicated/active, but there are plenty of home matches in recent times where the atmosphere and stadium have been rocking.

Right now...not so much....but think about where we are, the unhappiness of the home support, the insipid performances on the field. 
Best atmosphere at the Bridge in recent months was probably the home league match against Manchester United. Whole ground on their feet for the whole of the match, all singing, all supporting. Helps to have a pantomime villain to focus on too, be they in black or red.

To cover your point about season tickets versus general sale, the club will not want to have every ticket as a season ticket seat. Completely self defeating from a revenue generation point of view.
40,000 tickets sold to people who will drink outside the ground, buy maybe 1 shirt a season (if that) not interested in the food, drink and merchandise.....or a large number of tickets sold on a match by match basis, a percentage of those as part of packages including hideously overpriced meals/hotel stays, eager to fill their suitcases with shirts and presents and souvenirs from their trip, repeated every home match.

Stadium growth is not targeted at increasing seats for season ticket holders at all. It's targeted at the day trippers/semi regulars/tourists and corporates who swell the match day revenue, and something that Manchester Untied have exploited massively.

 - The printed newspaper/magazine industry has been in free fall for the last decade. It follows that any business that depends on selling newspapers and magazines is almost certainly also in trouble. Your local newsagents is one of them.
 - Local shops have been falling left and right for twenty years or more - they can't hope to compete with the supermarkets, and the little old ladies who I suspect used to keep them going by buying much of their weekly shop there are dying off.
 - Inflation is part of the issue, but the few local shops that remain could easily bump the price up to 2p or 3p each - why haven't they? My guess is health &amp; safety. Selling food requires you to follow a whole lot of food safety laws. They're not too bad if the food is pre-packaged, but as soon as you sell things loose, they become a lot more complicated.

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"I took Physics, Maths, Further Maths, Chemistry and History (dropped after AS) and I'm now studying Physics. 

Physics and Maths are absolutely vital if you want to study Physics; I also reckon that Maths would be useful for Philosophy although I've never looked into it myself.

Further Maths is definitely a useful subject to take - primarily because it makes a lot of the other maths much, much easier to understand. If you do Physics you will probably spend your first term of maths lectures at uni catching up to the end of Further Maths A2 anyway.

That said, other than Physics and Maths, I think you can really take whatever interests you. I've very rarely found A-level Chemistry to be useful in a Physics context, so I think it would be flawed to take other 'hard' sciences to try and back up the Physics. The most important thing is that you enjoy it for two years and it's not something that serious universities will smirk at (e.g. media studies).

Edit: a lot of people are saying that maths and physics are a big step up from GCSE. Maths certainly is, but in a good way - the increased depth of explanation means that you understand what you are being taught much better. Another good thing about the maths courses is that the exams are actually pretty easy to do well in if you understand everything - there are many, many past papers available and if you just work through lots of them you can see the same questions asked time and time again. As a result, you can walk into an exam knowing almost exactly what is going to happen.

Physics, on the other hand, is a bit of a nightmare. I took the AQA A course and thought it was an absolute shambles. The course is designed such that it doesn't require the student to be taking Maths A-level, which is possibly the most idiotic decision that they could have made. As a result, a lot of the things in the course are explained *very* poorly in the official course materials - I remember one specific 'proof' that tried to justify some equation by claiming that two triangles were 'similar' (not in the mathematical sense).

Furthermore, the course (as with all the science courses) seems to change every 4-5 years, meaning that there is a constant dearth of past papers to practise. This is particularly bad as the papers are shoddily written, often containing mistakes and hilariously vague questions. I took a module where one question asked for an explanation of the origin of the term *horsepower*. Yes, honestly. The specimen papers released by the board always contain mistakes - I think the most I found in one mark scheme was five.

This shouldn't put you off doing Physics though - it's a great subject and a lot of the content is really interesting.

true,herb-nerd,null,null,"Mate, do you honestly think i am an idiot? As I’m beginning to believe you are. 
i am aware of the link between cannabis use (THC specifically) can exacerbate schizophrenia and is indeed a factor in its development. 
HOWEVER, it is a factor, not a cause. The scale that it increases probability of schizophrenia is comparable to breathing everyday pollutants, living in a city ect. Living in a city raises your probability of developing schizo …. Everything in life is a probability factor!) . The best fucking medical journals on the matter still can’t decide if schizophrenia is caused by chronic cannabis use or that pre-disposition (genetically) to schizophrenia increases probability of chronic consumption. 
In simpler terms, they are still not sure it it’s the cause or result of mental health issues. 
ALSO if you have even read this thread, i discussed that thc is indeed a psychotic and that cbd is a potent antipsychotic.

So the link between cannabis and schizophrenia is tenuous at best and in fact my friend if you go to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and do some reading on the matter you will see this. 
The fact that you came into this thread with no apparent intention other than causing a little hassle is irritating. However I hope you can see that I am in fact not a retarded “stoner” but rather bright engineering student who feels strongly about an injustice in society. 
Anyway, everything I have said in this amounts to a loose collation of everything I have read online from the journals and papers I have access to and the people I know who are composing thesis’s on the matter for their doctorate in psychology. 
Also, in comparison to alcohol, tobacco etc. The side effects/dangers (they are different things!) of cannabis are dwarfed. So one could say the damage done from ""overdosing"" on weed would be negligible. The definition of the word negligible ""quantities so small that they can be ignored "".

Shelvey by contrast, attempted killer balls, a few long range shots, gave the ball away countless amount of times, was defensively mediocre and often out of position but because he looked ""impressive/dangerous"" with the few long range shots and killer balls everyone thought he was better than hendo.

Now that hendo is actually played in the right position and has some confidence, his offensive qualities are finally coming through as well.  He can pass, he can create, he can shoot, he can score.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I don't think that there is one rule for wealthy people who emigrate for pleasure and another for poor people who emigrate because they need to feed their families. 

Ignoring the difference money can make in ones life is not going to change the reality of what it can (and does) do for retirees moving abroad (or immigrants moving here). Hell, several countries openly allow immigration if the immingrant has a stash of funds to bring with them - but since the two groups are entirely different in almost every aspect, I'm not sure why you appear to think it's legitimate to compare the two in the first place.

&gt;Their circumstances may differ but if one should be expected to 'integrate' then so should the other.

See above - you have to accept that the two groups are different enough that they can't be compared - why do you think there are no masses of poor, old-age immigrants? And even if we talk about economic immigrants that already have wealth - you can't ignore the influence or options that money buys them; *nobody* does. Otherwise, if you're going to assert that simply utilising your own money is unfair, then (following that logic) if I see someone driving to work in an Aston Martin, then I should have one as well because otherwise it's unfair on me and using the train is a nightmare (or alternatively, they should be forced to use the train - but either option is extremely unlikely to actually happen, yes?).

&gt;The consternation with lack of integration, unless I'm mistaken, is portrayed as a cultural and not an economic issue.

It generally is indeed - my example was originally to stop the been-done-before disingenious argument about ex-pat retirees being no different from economic immigrants - this comparison only holds water if you pretend that money makes no difference and that old-age retirees are no different from poor economic migrants. The reality doesn't agree, on either score.

&gt;So yes, I think the economic aspect is more or less irrelevant.

I'd suggest that with the revelation that a lot of immigrants are actually *not* spending chunks of the money they earn here (because they're sending it home), the economic aspect should be given more prevalence than it has up until now, because even Labour have admitted they didn't realise this would happen (and thus the money they'd anticipated being generated by new workers hasn't materialised in anything like the figures they predicted).",0,1359636244,null,0,false,0,c86usrr,t3_17iwic,t1_c86usrr,t1_c86a68p,null,1431139402,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You know what, I've tried to be polite, but really fuck you.  You know absolutely nothing about his or my own circumstances.  I spent *four fucking years* in constant contact with a piss poor social services department and local council.  They would not act unless he actually hurt himself or someone else, and when he actually did they managed a whole fucking 24 hours of respite care for him before dumping him back with his mum.  He's spent his life being told he's a worthless piece of shit, being sidelined and belittled.  His own fucking sister tried to have him put into care so she could take even more advantage of her mum.  

Do you not think I would have taken him in if I could?  I've got four kids of my own to look after, one of whom has her own mental health issues as well as a seriously disabled wife to care for even if we'd have had the room, which we didn't with six of us living in a three bedroom house.  We provided every possible bit of help to him we could despite our own problems.  We were the ones that got him help from the NHS, into college and helped him get his first job, as well as got him out from under his mum and into his own place.  So once again fuck you and your holier than thou attitude.  

&gt;ADHD isn't an excuse for not working. It's not an excuse for pissing your money up the wall.

He's not fucking pissing it up the wall, he's had several jobs but like an awful lot of people at the moment he's unemployed.  He provides for his baby and pays his bills but thanks to being told he's useless for most of his life he's really worried that he just won't cope well with having to budget monthly.  I fail to see why you find that so hard to understand. Actually I don't I've come to the conclusion that you live in some middle class fantasy world were everything is sweetness and light and the worst you have to deal with is the price of olive oil going up in Waitrose.

I remember against Birmingham away in the cup, Kirwin remarked that having Diouf and McCormack up front allowed Leeds to play better football, and Eddie Gray replied that you could play the exact same style of football with Becchio - just send it to his feet instead of his head, for Pete's sake. But no, Warnock is a long ball merchant and so long as he has a player capable of winning balls in the air, he'll use him - and blame him being on the pitch for Leeds' brand of hoofball.

Becchio's treatment under Warnock has been ridiculous; I'm sick of the little digs Warnock has been making at Becchio's expense all season and don't blame him for leaving.

I'm not even that happy about signing Morison. He's 29-years-old, the same age as Becchio, so it's not even like we're bringing in someone who will last longer. Moreover, he's presently injured with a hamstring injury and - unlike Becchio, who hasn't been in the Premiership but has done well against all manner of Premiership sides - we *know* that he's not good enough to go up a division. He won't even be the same player that left Millwall, because the self-belief and confidence won't be there like it was when he joined Norwich. I sincerely hope that he proves me wrong, but right now I feel bitter because he'll likely push McCormack out of the team when he gets fit, even though Ross is currently in goalscoring form.

It is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially.

If you forget about the jobs argument (which is a fallacy) you're left with culture, which is the stem from which the DM's journalism reaches out from. But they're misguided.

That said, calling someone's views racist is a pretty easy way to quell an argument by character assassination. But what about what happens when the people who want an inclusive society full of mixed races and cultures end up with self-segregated hotspots where immigrants have failed to integrate? It's quite easy - we all go back to being primeval idiots.

Cultural integration is a two way street, so I'm sure there's more that can be done from our end, but there's still a problem with people coming in from other countries that don't speak the language, don't integrate, and don't really seem like they have any want to.

This also works two ways - the stereotype Brit retiring, moving to Spain, and not bothering to integrate is one. But they're fairly self limiting as they're mostly in their 50s and, well, you know the rest.

But what can be said of the families that come here and knowingly or not teach their kids these same isolationist values? That's what worries me because it sounds like it evokes a tribal mentality which I thought we as a civilisation were trying to overcome, because nobody wins.

Other countries teach you their language when you immigrate - it's mandatory and sometimes you're even *paid* to do it. As a whole I don't see the same problems there as I do here.

You did say 900 however, which kinda implies things.

My point here is that you're pigeon-holing the Doctor, who isn't human, into a very human corner. Which I'm going to blame on the writers for making 10 oh so very human in nature. 

Other thing, for all we know that moment of going to see Rose at at the end of The End of Time was his closure, plus we have no idea how long it actually was by the time he regenerated into 11. The Doctor lies about his age for one(Seven said he was 900, as did Nine), and there is plenty that happens off screen. Who knows how long he was knocking around the universe before TEoT, and he was as evidenced by marrying Queen Elizabeth I(""Good old Queen Bess, and let me tell you her nickname is no longer..."").

You don't have to like a relationship, even if it's a show you like. I accept Rose/Doctor was a thing even if I think it's 100 times creepier than Angel/Buffy ever was. By Let's Kill Hitler she was guilt, like many previous companions before her and some to come. Hell he got more torn up with Amy and he wasn't in love with her, but then again she was in and out of his life for a couple hundred years.

They also paid £1500 for a hideous, metal shelter type thing, in the middle of nowhere, so that the yobs,  who are getting pissed  and trashing other peoples properties, and screaming like banshees in the middle of the night, go there instead.

There is no accountability, and huge sums of money are wasted on stupid schemes like above.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;Plus fuck people who whine about privacy but then media whore them selfs.

I think you might have a very one sided view of people. Kate was one example as I don't read the kind of tabloids which tend to do that kind of stuff. The point still stands. Who ever you are, you have the right to privacy. Right to privacy is hard (perhaps not impossible) to make compatible with a completely free press, or completely free information. This is *one of the reasons* why I'm not in favour of a completely free press.

&gt;Plus you talk about press freedom, well unfortuantly you can't have democracy with out the free press

Not true. Democracy is significantly better with a free-**er** press than without. However that does not mean that democracy is impossible without a free press (not saying I advocate democracy without reasonably free media coverage) but this is beside the point

I fear we're getting the idea of what free press really is mixed up. Having a 100% free press means the all information that is out there being open to the public and the press being able to say what they want 100% of the time about 100% of things. My only problem there is I don't want the press running around with old family photos of my brothers and sisters doing private family things, which with 100% free press they would be able to. That is not a world I want to live in so I advocate for less-than-free press.

The problem doesn't stop with my baby pictures being leaked. Problems also include misinformation proliferation. In the British media countless false stories are proliferated, most notably about the EU (see bendy bananas, tight rope walkers having to wear hard hats, ect). Loads of these stories go unchecked and lead to people forming opinions based on false evidence which leads to a horribly informed electorate.

That is a prime example of **a free press damaging democracy**. If we had proper limitations (such as in Denmark where when a newspaper is found to have proliferated misinformation the newspaper must face financial penalties and fill up an entire page saying they made a mistake and other things) then it's better, but still not ideal.

If an English team should win the Europa League, they will take the place of the lowest ranked team of the other three usually qualified teams. This means the one who gets the place via league position, so 5th place is not a guarantee for European competition. The only guarantee for Europa League is to win one of the three cups (Europa League, FA Cup or League Cup) and the only guarantee for Champions League is 1.-3. place in the league or to win the Champions League. This is the absolutes. 

I'll try to expand:

 - For the Europa League, the highest ranked domestic position is the FA Cup winner. They get the first EL spot - unless qualified to Champions League as winner/by league position.

 - The second highest ranked is the League Cup. This year, Swansea and Bradford will duke it out in the League Cup. So one of those teams get the second Europa League spot. 

 - Then comes the highest placed team in the Premier League not qualified for the Champions League - usually fifth place (can be fourth place if a team in fifth or lower wins the Champions League). They claim the third EL spot - unless a lower placed team wins the Europa League.


Example: By miraculous luck, Oldham wins the FA Cup. So they get the first spot. Bradford wins the League Cup and gets the second spot. Then a bit of imaginitive speculation: Arsenal wins the Champions League, but end in fifth place. So that means the top 3 teams in the Premier League (most likely Man Utd, Man City and Chelsea) get the three next spots. We win the Europa League, but end in 7th place. Tottenham ends up 4th and Everton 6th, but neither will enter any European competition as the places are already taken by the different tournament winners.

2) Wanting to step up and have a constructive role: I've been a trustee for the last year, Trustees are there to scrutinise what the union does, and this basically means we ask lots of questions, and are quite critical. I think after all of my questioning and criticising, it's the time that I actually did something constructive and added value to the organisation.

3) Education: It's really the only job I can see myself doing. I had to go against the odds to get to University and its made me really passionate about making our provision both accessible and the best it could possibly be.

Now, I accept that that makes things very difficult for those whose task is to get as much tax as possible.  However, that's the price you pay for a free society.  Just as innocent until proven guilty guarantees that sometimes a guilty person goes free -- that is better than the alternative.

Tax avoidance is perfectly legal (that is the very definition of the difference between avoidance and evasion).

In reality, with a few exceptions, people will drink each others brews quite happily despite difference in methods. The key is honing your own particular process until you are happy.


Personally I boil the kettle, put two sugars in the bottom of the cup and the teabag on top. When the kettle is boiled I very slowly pour the boiling water onto the tea. The bag will move around and I make sure the stream of water is always hitting the main clump of tea. I stir it around a bit and then add milk. I give the bag a good squeeze against the side of the cup to get the good stuff out. I then let it loose again and stir it around to let more water in between the leaves. One more good squeeze and I take the teabag out. About 40s to a minute total from when the kettle finishes boiling. 

Half the battle in imparting flavour from tea into the water is the actual water coming in contact with the tea. If you aim the stream at the tea then all the water comes in contact during the initial pouring.

If you stick the water in first then dump the tea bag in then you are relying solely on diffusion which is why a lot of people end up leaving it in for 4 minutes to brew. Other people leave it in for ages because they like the ""strength"". In my opinion 4 minutes is ridiculous. It starts to sour and taste a bit stale.


Secrets? In Scotland we have pretty great tap water. That's one of the big downers in the US and parts of England (I'm looking at you Cambridge). We also have electric kettles (very few households don't have one) which boil the water ridiculously quick and makes the hole process less tedious.

Have you worked in London? As rough as travelling is (I commute 2 hours each way - bus, train, and walking) it's really not that bad. The benefits of working in London far outweigh the negatives. Although maybe I'm just lucky with my route..? 

Time spent travelling is definitely an issue but I don't think I could ever take a pay cut to move closer to home (Unless I had a child or something). Moving to London would come first!

However I'd **definitely** take a pay cut to never make tea or answer the phone again! :)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Oh yeah, definitely. Anyone with a few brain cells know they made their point and further protests are going to be fruitless in the eyes of most of the public. I reckon they are carrying on this malarkey against what is a democratic decision (albeit kicking the hornets nest in retrospect) as a way to galvanise support through rabble rousing. If you look at Willie Frazer's web chat linked in /r/NI yesterday, he is adamant that this group is ""non-political"", in that they won't be forming a party but may give their ""blessing"" to candidates, such as himself. Splitting the unionist vote isn't going to help their argument and I see all of this as self-serving for a select few like Bryson and Frazer.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Of course. It's the ""old"" system (not sure when it was phased out, sometime in the 70s I think, but I don't know as both my parents were privately educated). 

Essentially, you went to your local primary school until the age of 11. At 11 - year 6 - you took the 11+ test which determined which school you went to. Either a Grammar school (if you ""passed"" the test) or a secondary modern (a comprehensive school). 

Basically, it creamed off the top 20% (approximation) of students for the grammar schools and left the rest of the schools with all the ""less able"" ones. The problem, people argue, is that it was all based on 1 test. If a child was ill, or had suffered some kind of anguish recently, they may not perform as well as they should and not get into a grammar school and thus be burdened by this for the rest of their education. As well as the inequality in that grammar schools tended to get more funding because their pupils were more likely to succeed and so it created a nasty cycle in that grammar schools got better and better while secondary moderns got worse and worse. 

Personally, I like the system, although I acknowledge I am very biased, being a grammar school student myself. I think it encourages academic excellence rather than the current system which encourages mediocrity (ie; 5Cs including English &amp; maths to get on the league tables). At my comprehensive school (I was at a comprehensive for years 7-11) it seemed teachers were only interested in getting the less able students Cs or Bs, rather than students like me with high potential, A*s. 

At the grammar schools they encourage academic achievement and strive for success. A ""B"" grade is regarded as a failure to many. While this may be the wrong attitude for some, it certainly emphasises the importance of a good education. 

To clarify why I think it resolves the disruption problem: Intelligent children are more likely to enjoy work and want to work. Why? They find the work easier, thought-provoking and stimulating. Children who find the work particularly hard from a young age get frustrated and confused and dislike school because of it. Therefore, putting all the bright children into one school not only creates a greenhouse for growing intellectual brilliance but removes the majority of disruptive pupils who tend to be the ones who don't get into grammar schools, and therefore those who wish to learn and go on to university and professions are all in one environment, while the more challenging pupils are in another one. This also allows teachers to be hired based on the classroom requirements. At a grammar school teachers don't necessarily need to be as able to stand up and discipline a child as they do at a comprehensive school because there are fewer disruptive pupils. So ""stricter"" teachers can be hired by the comprehensive school to encourage good behaviour and help the less able students progress. 

I concede that there are always exceptions to the rule. At my comprehensive school, in my top set class there was a boy of incredible intelligence who simply could not follow the rules. I have no doubt he could've (and would've in times gone by) gone to a grammar school if he had wanted, but he chose not to. He ended up being expelled for theft and drug dealing. And there will always be students who are so intelligent they find all the work boring and so become disruptive, but these are generally isolated and rare incidences, and they would be far less likely to disrupt in the tripartite system than the current system.

There are pros and cons, but it's now illegal to start up new grammar schools so I guess it won't come back any time soon.",0,1359651640,null,0,false,0,c86ygfl,t3_17kmxg,t1_c86ygfl,t1_c86unaf,null,1431141265,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The first bit would appear to by John Stones from Barnsley for £3 million. As esteemed colleague John Percy stated earlier, a few bob could yet be spent on Jack Butland, with Everton’s interest registered. What this all points to is the possibility of Negredo receding as the clock ticks ever closer towards the witching hour. Negredo's agent's somewhat downbeat assessment that a move from Seville was 'impossible' would, at this stage, appear to sum up the situation regarding the chase for the striker. As was anticipated this morning, however, the lights are likely to remain on at Goodison well into the night.

true,MickMorrison,null,null,"The way they address availability is actually quite interesting. In the video they were showing him addressing spikes over a very small period of time by turning on facilities that can come online with the flick of a switch (hydro mostly). Most facilities aren't like that though so general day to day planning is very different.

For instance, I worked in a coal plant with 2400Mw output. Basically a coal plant has 3 operating states. Offline, online and active production. To get one of the 4 units in this plant running from cold took several hours (starting from cold). The boilers take a long time to heat up to operating temperature. 

Once a unit is online it is not actually sending electricity out to the grid. All this means is that it is warm and can start producing within 30 minutes notice. Obviously it costs money to keep a unit online.

Now the power generation industry is split into three distinct subsections. Production, distribution and retail. A power plant is considered production and National grid is distribution.

National grid needs to make sure there is ample availability for the whole country at all times. They need to make sure they have enough sites online (as described above) and in the right areas so they can deal with any ups and downs in consumption. 

National grid buys availability from the production companies. They pay sites to remain online based on projected demand for electricity. It's all broken down into 30 minute time slots. Because they need to pay for availability they have to meticulously plan how much electricity is going to be required in any given 30 minute time slot. They don't want sites remaining online that aren't required because that's wasteful. On the other hand if they don't maintain ample production they are heavily penalised. Another interesting thing to note is that if a plant says ""we are going to have 600Mw production available from 13:00 to 16:00"" and then for whatever reason they can't provide, they have to pay the national grid the same going rate as they would have been paid to be online. 


So anyway, when a plant goes into production I think it gets paid a different rate for actual consumption. The key is to always have slightly higher availability than you need to handle any unexpected spikes. But you don't want too much availability otherwise you're wasting money keeping plants online that don't need to be. 

So for this reason they pay particular attention to the Weather, TV Schedule, daylight hours and things like public holidays that might effect demand.

Also, depending on the availability of other sites around the area, the going price for production varies a lot. The power plants to game the market by providing availability at the most profitable times and even have branched into long-game speculative energy trading. 

It's all a lot more complicated than that, but that's a brief overview. They take a lot into account when planning to save as much money as possible and keep strain on the grid down.

There's more info here about other incurred charges [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Grid_(Great_Britain)#Transmission_costs).

If you read about the 2008 incident on that page it mentions Longannet. I was there when that happened. A massive (128"") swing valve failed. The valve is counter balanced by a massive weight to help it open and close. The valve is like a non return valve that stops cooling water going back through the massive 5MW pumps that take cooling water from the river. Anyway, the counter balance snapped off and the valve slammed shut (it is mad heavy). This caused a massive pressure wave throughout the entire cooling water system and caused a whole load of damage. It was really funny. People were going nuts. I never realised another plant went offline at the same time. That makes it even more amusing. (I find humour in chaos).

Anyway, sorry if any of this info is inaccurate, it's been a long time since I worked there. My memory is a bit hazy. ",0,1359655831,null,0,1359656049,0,c86ztmu,t3_17ldcx,t1_c86ztmu,t1_c86ypfe,null,1431141903,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12

true,Riffler,null,null,"&gt;you don't know what is legal until it goes to court.

That's often - well, actually pretty  much always - the case with the current situation. If it was obvious what was and wasn't legal, there would be no need to go to court. The point with a GAAR is that embodies an assumption that schemes deliberately set up to reduce tax liabilities are illegal, rather than the current situation which is the opposite.

My point with speed cameras had a more subtle implicit subtext as well as the explicit point you've picked up.

For decades motorists knew that they could get away with speeding because the police really only had one way of catching them. Motorists got the idea that they were engaged in a game with the police, and the rules were clear and accepted by both sides. Motorists had built up a sense of entitlement - they were allowed to speed as long as they slowed down if they saw a police vehicle.

Then speed cameras came along and speeding motorists claimed the police were ""cheating"", that they were ""breaking the spirit of the law"". They weren't. The motorists had been cheating and getting away with it and the police were simply deploying new techniques to stop that cheating.

The prospect of a GAAR provokes precisely the same reaction in tax avoiders. They've been playing a game with the tax authorities for years. They know the rules of the game. They know how long it takes to close a loophole and they know that they can make enough money out of that loophole before it gets closed to make setting up avoidance schemes profitable. They have exactly the sense of entitlement speeding motorists had.

And now the government threatens to abolish the game and deploy new techniques against them.",0,1359656225,null,0,false,0,c86zyam,t3_17mdvi,t1_c86zyam,t1_c86xjmp,null,1431141963,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

* A level - Anything that appears on screen
* B level - Audio adventures and printed material produced by the BBC
* C level - Other audio adventures and printed material from official sources (e.g. Big Finish, IDW Publishing)

Any British citizen has the legal right to live in the UK. 

(As do Irish Republic citizens, many E.U citizens and many commonwealth citizens - we're welcoming people I guess) 

(There are exceptions if you have a serious contagious disease and can get treatment at home or if you have serious criminal convictions) 

You will need to apply for a British passport or a British identity card (get the passport, it's much more useful) to serve as your proof of right of residency. The process for US citizens is explained here http://ukinusa.fco.gov.uk/en/help-for-british-nationals/passports/how-to-apply/usa 

It says to allow 6 weeks for processing, but having worked for the passport service I'd advise you not to be surprised if it takes a bit longer and be very careful when filling out the forms and choosing a passport photo because a tiny mistake can cause a rejection and you have to start the whole process again. The forms are machine read so you do have to write clearly. 

It's $211 for the standard adult passport which isn't too bad, it is valid for 10 years and replacements after that period are a lot cheaper.  ",0,1359658110,null,0,false,0,c870lbw,t3_17n0fx,t1_c870lbw,t3_17n0fx,null,1431142264,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; Incidents that occurred that they have not given the employee an opportunity to respond to via the standard company process cannot be mentioned in a reference.

Wrong on three levels. 

Firstly, they have not been officially made redundant yet, there is a consultation process to complete which will take a few weeks, during which time they are still bound by their employee contracts. This is gross misconduct and a summary dismissal would be legally safe.

Secondly, even if they do not fire them all they have to do is initiate a disciplinary process *before* the employee is officially made redundant. In a reference they can say that the employee was undergoing a disciplinary process for abusing the company resource at the time they left. All fully legal and easily provable in a tribunal. I doubt any employment lawyer would advice taking it this far. Personally, I'd *not* make that employee redundant and see the process through. They would likely quit (losing any redundancy pay) and if you are feeling vindictive you could mention in a reference they quit during a disciplinary process.

Thirdly, there are also ""unofficial"" references, in fact I'd argue that this is how the UK job market works. If you know someone in the company that is willing to vouch for you then you are at an advantage. Conversely, if you have worked with someone who thinks you are a muppet then you have zero chance. 

Personally, I've seen this regularly in work. They look at the CV and note that the applicant worked with another existing employee at another company. Then they ask the existing employee for their thoughts. In the past I've said things like ""awesome guy, hire at any cost"" *and* ""do not touch, has serious attitude problems"". This is all done verbally and undocumented. 

With sites like LinkedIn this goes another step beyond. I've been contacted by both applicants and employers that I haven't spoken to in ten years asking about someone I've worked with or for recently. If I respect/like the person asking I'll give them an honest verdict over the phone.

&gt; It's been an amazing two and a bit years with hmv! (Only 1 &amp; 1/2 officially) Such a shame it had to end on that note. Someone had to speak!

&gt; I would apologise for the #hmvXFactorFiring tweets but I felt like someone had to speak. As someone without a family to support/no mortgage

&gt; I felt that I was the safest person to do so. Not to mention, I wanted to show the power of Social Media to those who refused to be educated

&gt; Just to set something straight, I did not ‘hijack’ the hmv twitter account. I actually assumed sole responsibility of Twitter &amp; Facebook 

&gt; over two years ago, as an intern.When asked (this afternoon), I gladly provided the password to head office. I also set another member of

&gt; staff up as a manager on Facebook, and removed myself from the admin list. I didn’t resist any requests to cooperate.

&gt; Since my internship started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance of Social Media – not as a short-term commercial

&gt; tool, but as a tool to build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable real-time feedback from the consumers that

&gt; have kept us going for over 91 years. While many colleagues understood and supported this, it was the more senior members of staff who

&gt; never seemed to grasp its importance.

&gt; I hoped that today's actions would finally show them the true power and importance of Social Media, and I hope they're finally listening.

My username was because I used to tell everybody Lucas would captain Brazil at his home World Cup in 2014 many years ago when people were still quite skeptical about him.  I never put a bet on it in the end which is probably for the best given his injury problems have probably ruined his momentum and Thiago Silva now has a pretty solid hold on the captaincy.

Morison is 6'2 (I was genuinely surprised at how tall he really is - Warnock looked like a dwarf stood next to him!) and has played up front on his own for Norwich, so he will literally replace Becchio and the team's playstyle will not change.

Funnily enough, I don't think that this will suit Morison at all, because at Millwall he scored goals through movement, running onto a through ball or towards a cross made so that he was running at the goal when he met it (sadly the kind of cross Leeds don't make).

The difference will be that Warnock has his own man now, so he won't blame him for not playing well - or even have the audcity to blame him for the hoofball tactics. One of the worst things about Warnock's management is that he has been overly critical of players he has inherited, such as Lees, White and McCormack, while he never criticises the likes of Austin or Peltier.

It would be unrealistic to expect CL football after this season. It's within reach and *could* happen, but is relatively unlikely. That being said, if we want to keep players like Suarez, Sterling, Skrtel, Henderson, and Coutinho here, as well as attract even better talent, I think the target HAS to be at least 4th next season. I would be very, very sad if Suarez left after this season, but if we don't make 4th after next season I wouldn't blame him and wouldn't be mad at him.

true,JoeyCalamaro,null,null,"&gt; Today we are learning a valuable lesson in information security: The guys who you employ to ""do computers"" should probably not be fucked over without a lot of caution.

I manage a bunch of CMS websites for various clients and early last spring, during my first vacation in years, I got a phone call as I was wandering into the hotel lobby of my resort. It was the marketing director of one of those various companies and he was concerned because their site was down.

Now I'm very familiar with this site, and like almost all the others I manage, it's never been offline. Yet clearly, as I can tell from my phone, the thing is hosed. So I cancel my plans for the evening and spend some time getting the site back in order. And very quickly it becomes apparent that it was intentional. Someone with credentials logged in and purposefully screwed things up. It's not a big deal, we've got backups, but I do want to make sure that all passwords are changed and this person is locked out.

I also want to determine which account was used and how it was compromised, but the client isn't so receptive to that. And soon enough I learn why. The head of IT is no longer with the company and he left (was dismissed?) without anyone changing his credentials. Lovely. 

So anyway the site is restored and the only real casualty is an evening of my vacation. That is, until I get back in the office and find out that I've lost the client. Yeah, that's right. I was dismissed too and no they didn't change my credentials, either. 

Lucky for them I've got a moral compass.

Well, each to their own. But believe it or not (and brace yourself, this may be difficult to comprehend), America isn't the only developed country in the world.


On a different note, it's fascinating (and disappointing) how this post has attracted so many butthurt comments from Americans who think I am *actually* claiming that castles make Britain militarily superior.

This is a goddamn excessive-patriotism subreddit, like /r/MURICA or /r/straya. The stuff that gets posted in these sorts of subreddits are mostly jokes, meant to be a parody of ignorant jingoism and the various quirks associated with a nation, etc. 

I've got far more comments from Americans on this post than I do from Brits. Are you guys massively insecure or something?

Did a post that was clearly a joke (a joke that was partly directed at Britain itself, as it indirectly highlighted that Britain's military *is* technically inferior to America's) really incite enough hurt feelings that you and dozens of other Americans had to come into /r/INGLIN and *seriously* ""refute"" this post by pointing out the obvious fact that America is militarily superior?",0,1359662333,null,0,1359662647,0,c87210q,t3_15t4j4,t1_c87210q,t1_c870ngb,null,1431142941,11,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,11

Ron Gourlay may want people to think that Chelsea is one big happy family around the globe singing 'Blue is the Colour' and buying new 'Eden Hazard' shirts every season, but it will always be made up of a relatively small group who are the clubs core and an increasing new element outside of that.

No, the problem is that you think that the police aren't human and that even when I show you evidence that your opinion (say on this retrial being a fit up) is wrong all it does is make you double down on your preconceived notions.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Since Tony Blair asked Parliament before invading Iraq while using a Royal power to deploy troops it seems likely that it's now a rule that parliament must be consulted before taking control of the military. I'm not sure how the military would react if ordered by the monarch herself. The PM is the only person really allowed to do this and i'm fairly sure they would refuse to carry out the order. 

It would be interesting because people in favour of the monarchy usually defend themselves from criticism by saying that the Queen taking power would never happen so it's not a issue. If they were proved wrong I think the vast vast majority of people previously defenders of the monarchy would side parliament and the parliament would probably just either take away all power from the monarchy or abolish it straight away and because of the circumstances it would be considered legal. But then again the original argument is strong. It's so incredibly unlikely that all this is hypothetical. 

Technically Obama can pardon all terrorists and make Charles Mason his secretary of state (at least I think that's possible in principle). He has the power to pardon criminals ad to appoint his SoS but it's so unlikely to happen that it's almost pointless to consider it. On top of that while constitutional conventions that limit the Queen's power are technically not enforceable in law if something like this were to happen nothing would prevent the supreme court from deciding that in the circumstances the royal prerogative could be judged by judges. They have already indicated that in some situations the court can judge on these matters and it would be a simple matter of extending the principle to all situations; something that could happen anyway in the next 10 years anyway. There are many principles including human rights which they could use to justify their position. All this means is that parliament would probably declare itself superior to the monarch, abolish the monarchy, ensure the military would only respond to political prerogative powers and not the monarchs personal powers (which would be abolished anyway if the monarchy were abolished) and then would probably win any court cases that ensued. It would be very fun to watch though.

true,UncleArthur,sussex,East Grinstead,"If you are a UK taxpayer and gift to charity under Gift Aid, two things happen:

1. The charity can claim an extra 25% of your donation from the government, which is the tax that a Basic Rate taxpayer would have paid on the money.
2. Your Basic Rate tax band - currently £34,370 - is increased by the gross amount of your donation.

An example probably helps here.

Fred has gross employment income of £43,475. Currently, after the Personal Allowance (£8,105) is deducted, his taxable income is £35,370. He would pay tax as follows:

£34,370 @ 20% = £6,874  |  £1,000 @ 40%  = £400  |  Total = £7,274

If he makes a donation to a charity of £800, then the charity claims tax relief of £200 from the government, making the total gross donation worth £1,000.

Meanwhile, Fred's Basic Rate Band is increased by the same amount (£1,000) so his new tax calculation is as follows:

£35,370 @ 20% = £7,074  |  Nil @ 40%  |  Total = £7,074

This saves Fred £200, which is the amount of extra Higher Rate tax he had paid on his gross income relating to the £800 net donation. So it is giving him back the tax as a ""thank you"" for gifting to charity. It is important to note that you must declare your charitable gift on your Self Assessment tax return, or the tax man won't know to increase your Basic Rate band.

Obviously, if your gross income is less than £42,475 you are a Basic Rate taxpayer and therefore any increase in your tax bands will have no effect on you.

The above is a simplification, but it explains the basics.

I don't want to panic you in any way, because I am neither qualified, nor familiar with current prosecutorial practice. There is a huge amount of discretion in how things of this nature are handled. 

But you do have a defence here, of sorts, especially if you had a reason to have the blade on yoy before forgetting it, and while it won't necessarily get you off, it can be taken into account in how things develop. Trying to go into a club with one is not good, however.

Speak to a solicitor as soon as you possibly. This could be very serious, or it could not be. It is significaht enough to be very much worth the short term expense. A solicitor can only help. When you do get charged you will be in a vastly more prepared position. Aside from the possible defences (the burden of which it will be in you to prove), you have to be VERY clear on the mitigating factors. Without mitigating factors a custodial sentence is automatic. With them the punishment can be as low as a fine.

The sentencing range here is from a fine, right up to 12 weeks custody, of which you would serve 6. You obviously want closer to a fine than custody.

true,thebeginningistheend,null,null,"OK, well then. I think claiming that Moffat has made Doctor Who less British is wrong. Simple realities of the budget was the reason why the effects were so bad not by any stylistic choice. The claim that Doctor Who was campy is dubious to say the least. Doctor Who was always at its worst when it was 'campy', I'm thinking of the late '70s and '80s with stories such as The Leisure Hive or The Happiness Patrol. 

The clearest difference in Doctor Who can be seen in how the Doctor is portrayed. RTD's Doctor cared and shared, he loved and he mourned and he was like your best mate you have a laugh with down the pub, which is okay but a bit dull and samey. Matt Smith is something very different, he's inscrutable, mysterious, uncomprehendingly alien, he'll save you and have fun with you, but then he'll lie, he'll spurn your love, he'll lead you into a world of nightmares, abandon you on an alien planet for half-a-lifetime and you never know what he'll do next and when you eventually die he'll go bounding off to his with a grin on his face, your whole life nothing but a blip on his radar. That's much more Classic Doctor than RTD's portrayal, one thing the classic Doctor was never was *safe*. 

Yes there's always been humor in Doctor Who but in RTD's era this came about due to the ridiculous and zany situations and gurning characters rather than being the product of clever writing and genuine wit. Classic Doctor Who was funniest when written by Douglas Adams which Moffat's writing is much more reminiscent of than RTD's. 

In Moffat stories, the narratives are complex but the resolution is never a deux ex machina. I don't think I'll never fully forgive RTD for fixing the ending to Parting of the Ways by giving Rose Tyler magic Tardis powers. RTD was a great writer but with a monomaniacal obsession with soap opera style relationships even over making good telly. Season 1 ends with Rose proving her love for the Doctor by coming back to save him, *so* benevolent god RTD zaps away the Daleks. In Season 2 RTD sternly confronts the Doctor with a dilemma to save earth at the cost of losing Rose. The Doctor makes his choice and so RTD zaps away the Daleks, the Cybermen and Rose. In Season 3 Martha Jones must prove her faith in the Doctor, she passes the Relationship Test so RTD once again saves the earth. And so on and so on. Moffat's series may be too clever, and too fantastical but thats what Doctor Who's always been about. But RTD's series doesn't give a stuff about was being smart, the Villains are defeated through the power of caring and actually the best thing in the universe was staying at home and eating chips and curling up in front of the telly  to watch Doctor Who. It was domestic, safe and bourgeois TV. Give me Moffat's crazy, dangerous, insane adventures in Time and Space any day.

This is just a silly stereotype.  To be honest, I suspect that the other way round is a lot more common.  People seem to become more confident, independent, and willing to break the mould as they get older, and society is becoming more tolerant of same-sex relationships.  A lot of gay people (and trans people) stay in the closet until middle age too.

&gt; The church, and others like them, want to reinforce the social stigmas so that ""those that can be saved"" feel pressured to listen to the parts of their sexuality that fit the silly books they base their lives on.

&gt; It is still really abhorrent but not necessarily as stupid as people think. Their fight isn't about people who don't have a straight bone in their body.

This doesn't sound completely inconceivable, but I've honestly never heard any of the anti-LGBT religious groups express this idea.  The mainstream Christian groups (like the Catholics and the Church of England) generally accept that some people have ""homosexual tendencies"", but encourage them to either remain celibate or have relationships with the opposite gender.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"Having Aspergers doesn't give you ownership of the word. It's still just a word, and it conveys a meaning. He didn't ""make light of it,"" he made an analogy to describe why he felt this way. I feel that the analogy adequately conveyed what he was trying to say. Anyone who isn't *looking* for offense won't find it in his statement. He didn't say ""I was acting stupid like I had Aspergers"" or some other statement that is demeaning in any way.

In fact, I see the statement more as sympathizing with people who have Aspergers rather than making light of it. He's relating to them, not ridiculing them.

That said, embrace your flaws or you'll never be happy; This is the greatest truth I've found in life. People only get ""offended"" by stuff like this when they're feeling sorry for themselves or are in denial about some aspect of reality. It's the whole, ""You don't know me! You don't know what it was like being me, so don't try to relate to me!"" syndrome that you always see on Jerry Springer and the like. People like to feel as though the world is more unfair to them than everyone else, because it makes them feel less responsible for their plight. Constantly getting offended reinforces their belief that they're the underdog, fighting against the current of society that is pushing them down. That's why people who are offended at stuff like this almost seem *excited* to point out how offended they are. This is also why most people with *real* actual problems aren't offended so easily, and most of the people who crusade about this kind of thing are doing so on behalf of others.

From the fact that you said they couldn't caution you yesterday I assume that you were interviewed, admitted carrying the knife and presented the circumstances in which it happened? Did you have a lawyer present for the interview?

You're on bail to return to the station, where they will do one of three things: NFA (no further action - this is what you want), Rebail (unlikely to happen, case is pretty cut and dry), or charge.

If they charge then it'll be under http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/139

It depends massively on the type of blade you were carrying - if its a little work knife I'd expect you to get NFA'd seeing as the prosecution wouldnt be in the public interest (and would be a massive waste of everyone's time), if its a hulking great hunting knife then you'll probably be charged.

Its an ""either way"" offense so you get to chose if you want a jury trial or not, but I wouldnt worry about that for now. If the OIC (officer in the case - the investigating officer) and AO (arresting officer) were telling you to not worry about it I think its unlikely that you'll get charged.

Ok, they can do that by simply tipping cash in to a hat, then getting a treasurer to pay the teachers. The problem is that sometimes the treasurer would run off with the money. Ok, so you introduce a way of registering and structuring non-profits so that the board have to produce accounts, spend the money on the right things, and generally be accountable to the shareholders.

Take away non-profit status from all the things you don't like - schools, maybe churches, whatever - and they don't suddenly become for-profit taxable organisations. Instead they disband and become informal groups. There's still no tax to pay, since no-one is making money (other than the teachers, who pay income tax), but there's a greater risk of fraud.

Ok, but now I fill in a tax return. To pay £100 out of taxed income, I needed £166.67 in untaxed income. I can ask for the remainder of the tax back, i.e. £33.67. The justification for this is that it puts me in the situation where I never received that untaxed income.

What it doesn't do is put me ahead. While I can claim back some of the money, I'm always out of pocket: it is a genuine loss to me, and a genuine gain to the charity.  It's not very intuitive: for instance as a 40% tax payer I can claim money back, but a 25% tax payer can't because the charity has already claimed all of the tax.
