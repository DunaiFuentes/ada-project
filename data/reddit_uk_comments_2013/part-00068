Manchester United made their first ¬£100,000 signing in August 1962 with the transfer of Denis Law from Torino for ¬£110,000, ""a new British record""
.... There's the 1st British record!

Lesson 2 -
The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the ¬£1.5 million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion.
.... There's the second record of most money spent in Britain in which the title goes to.. Wait up....Manchester United...

Lesson 3 -
When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid ¬£7 million, almost double their previous record of ¬£3.75 million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier. In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in the space of a month, first paying PSV Eindhoven ¬£19 million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then ¬£28.1 million to Lazio for Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n
... Ah oh, looks like united in the space of 6 years had spent nearly a world record amount of money for their players!!!


Now you see... The scummy, red shite have been involved in record transfers well before City began to contemplate even spending anywhere near that amount.

Second, that stupid scooter. Why would they need to buy the scooter to get to the other asteroid, when the TARDIS is less than half a block away? Why would the Doctor insist that Clara sell something of significant sentimental value, taking up valuable time convincing Clara, when it would have taken half the time to walk the rest of the way to the MUCH FASTER MODE OF TRANSPORTATION?

Third, the story was written poorly enough that it's not clear whether the Doctor and Clara reacted differently to having their memories ""taken"" from the way the Queen would have.

No political leader has had this many people celebrate their death since Adolf Hitler. There has to be a lot of very powerful feeling underneath the surface to generate that much hatred.

She demanded that they sunk the ship, which resulted in the deaths of over 320 Argentinian sailors, which was more than half of the total number of Argentinian lives lost.

As for Spurs. A lot of Bale's goals are either runs that dribble past 5 players then he slots it into the corner, or they're 40 yard screamers from out wide. You hardly saw RVP scoring these types of goals last year (and this year.)

true,[deleted],null,null,"You keep saying ""you guys"". I'm not arguing for anyone other than myself. I did, in fact make the same exact point I made earlier. Arsenal were reliant on Van Persie to be the focus of their attacks because that's the only logical thing to do. If Wenger were to try and make Walcott the focus solely for the sake of not being seen as a ""one man team"", he'd be considered a fool, and rightly so. 

IMO you guys were reliant on several players, as is natural in a team sport, but obviously Van Persie had the most noticeable effect. From what I did see, you played your worst games when Arteta wasn't in the lineup, similarly to how Spurs always played like shit whenever Modric wasn't in the middle. Without Arteta in the lineup last year you guys didn't have a player who could keep possession going and help the team transition between defense and attack, and it showed. IIRC your win percentage was abysmal without Arteta, I think Arsenal only won one or two games all season when Arteta wasn't playing. 

As far as the screamers go, I think you're massively underestimating some of the goals Van Persie scored. The volley against Everton? Multiple goals from outside the box and assisted with some of the best dead ball deliveries in the PL. They don't have to be flashy to be something that no other player on your squad could do with that consistency. If you think anyone other forward on Arsenal's squad last year had the intelligence and technique to get into the right positions as often as Van Persie did, you're sorely mistaken. Van Persie didn't make 30 yard runs past 4 players because that's not in his skill set, just like Bale isn't necessarily going to pick a lobbed ball out of the air and volley it into the bottom corner from 10 yards out at a sprint because that's not one of his main skills. Bale's scored maybe two 40 yard screamers in the league this season. Van Persie didn't score those for Arsenal because he was the forward player. You rarely see strikers in a possession-based system score those goals, because they generally hang out around the edge of the box; Bale has played largely between the lines during his streak of good form and as such had the room to take shots from range. Again, this is down to their different skill sets. Van Persie is a brilliant finisher and has probably the best positioning sense of any forward in the league right now, and is also incredibly composed in front of goal. Bale's not like that. It's not so unusual for Bale to miss complete sitters (he missed several during his hot streak), and his positioning in the box leaves something to be desired sometimes, and this aspect of his game is improving, but before he had a pretty bad time with one-on-ones. What he is good at though, is running at players and shooting from distance, but even for that you need the contribution of other players creating space between the lines and AVB's tactics were more than likely adjusted to that. 

Regardless, just looking at the raw numbers, RVP scored or assisted 39 goals in 38 appearances in the PL, while up to now, Bale has scored/assisted 20 in 27. We're getting it now because Bale is the one that's shown in the highlight reels. No one sees Demb√©l√© winning possession and skipping past players to retain it, or Vertonghen making a 30 yard pass to assist Bale. I wouldn't say they're as critical, but as someone who presumably watched the majority of Arsenal games last season, you said that other players such as Song were important, and on our side, anyone would say that without Demb√©l√© and Vertonghen, we're up shit creek. In some games, like against United, Bale was practically invisible, and Lennon absolutely dominated. When Lennon is missing, even if Bale has a fantastic game, we look like shit. If we had Lennon for the majority of the run-in last season, I guarantee you that you would have been the ones looking forward to Thursdays this season.

tl;dr: It's a complicated situation. I think your argument is a bit flawed in the fact that it draws way too heavily on exaggerations of what Bale's done and downplays the contributions Van Persie played. In the end, it's a complicated topic, but I guarantee you that Bale and Van Persie being the focus of their team's attacks is no happy accident and was 100% intentional.",0,1365473933,null,0,false,0,c9bbqqn,t3_1byflz,t1_c9bbqqn,t1_c9bajvm,null,1431624614,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

true,galindafiedify,tardis,TARDIS,"I read further down you're going to the SoCal one. My family and I have had passes since it opened. It's a great park, especially for your daughter's age range. 

What's nice is that there are a lot of places for the parents to sit down and rest while the kids still play. There's a building a little further down past the mini-boat ride but before the spinny-water ride, where the kids can build little lego cars and race each other. There's also Hagrid's Hideaway. It's this great jungle gym fort thing that kids can just run wild on while the parents sit. It's also adult-sized so you don't have to leave your kid alone. There's also a water themed one so you might want to bring a bathing suit or a change of clothes. It's really fun but you get soaked after being there for two minutes.  Another one is the driving school. I haven't gone through it in over a decade, so I'm not sure if this is still how they do it; but the kids watch a little driver's ed video and then they go off to drive mini cars while the parents watch.

As far as food, there are a lot of options. There are hotdogs in Funtown (I think that's what it's called?), pizza by the Bionical Blasters, and there's also a nice garden restaurant by Pirate's Cove. I definitely recommend checking out the ice cream store that's right at the park entrance. They swirl flavor in with vanilla ice cream and it's the best. My family always stops there before going home.

Mini Land is really cool, it can get boring pretty quickly for a kid depending on their personality. On some of the lands there are buttons you can push to interact and make things move, half of them are usually broken though.

Overall, it's a fun place but it's definitely seen better days. It's one of those things where if you go once it's enough. But it's become a family tradition at my house.

When he's on the ball, he either passes back, or runs himself into a poor position upfield and gives the ball away, and then jogs back on defense.

true,dsruix,tennant,Tennant,"Just because you feel that the answer to 23 is good enough for you doesn't mean that the answer is good enough for everybody. It's as simple as that. People see different things in a fiction and, because it is a fiction, it allows that to happen. Canonization of fictional elements is slowly losing its weight. It will always exist, but it is no longer the end all. That's the beauty of a fiction. A fiction that, through the postmodern world has gained the ability to be received and expressed in terms far beyond that of the creator's own imaginations. 

Its like doctor Donna. When it was first mentioned by the ood, everybody clearly accepted the weird phrasing as referring to doctor and donna. Turns out, that perfectly clear answer was not so perfectly clear. The 4 beats? Clearly it's the Master and his drums. Only it wasn't. Or perhaps the field of trenzalore - the fall of the eleventh seems to point towards the death of the eleventh doctor. Clear cut, no nonsense. But maybe it isn't. After all, we can speculate that Matt Smith is going to be the doctor for a long whiles more, and, it is doubtful that Moffat would let that story point run that long. Maybe it's really the fall of the 11th Clara. Similarly, with 23, your theory about it being the death of the family's mother seems sound. But to me, something is off. What made Clara devide to leave in the first place? Why would that mother be important enough for Clara to leave out a whole year? Is it as simple as stopping her traveling plans? Maybe. But would the mother's death really feel as harrowing as her mother's death? Then there's the number 23 itself. Showing a number once is insignificant. Referencing a number twice (the tombstone) might still be a coincidence but certainly warrants interest. Yet, by typing the password wrong, the show highlights what was typed wrongly. Run you clever boy, 1 2 3. But again, she skips 3 and goes to 4. The skipping hearkens back to the skipping of 23. You might be happy with your answer, but I'm not. Your belief does not influence how I am going to look at the evidence. My belief us not going to influence how you look at the evidence. Disagree, but don't you dare tell anyone how they are stupid for seeing things you don't see or acknowledge. 

Honestly I feel your attitude towards the opinions of others is abhorrent. You seem to think you're steven moffat and you know exactly what everything already means. Newsflash, you don't. the right kind of interesting my ass. The right kind of interesting is when people try to figure out the mysteries that strike them. A process that only fuels their love of the show. The right kind of interesting is when they realize they've been thrown for a loop because the reality is so much more than what they imagine, or when their speculation led them to the right conclusion. The right kind of interesting is whatever keeps them interested. There's nothing wrong with being a passive audience and accepting everything as it comes, but the age of the active audience is now. Even actively calling a show out for what it has failed at or what it needed to differently is important because of how it ultimately affects the feedback loops that govern how media is made. And hey, some scholar in the future is going to look at doctor who and its relevance to the cold war and draw that connection and he will be perfectly in his own right to do so as long as he can provide sufficient evidence.

Certainly Moffat wouldn't write a script that depended on Christopher Eccleston reprising his role since he has been so publicly down on the possibility in the past. Yet if the Ninth Doctor's presence was only superficially used in the story for maybe some nostalgic in-jokes, then maybe Eccleston thought that would be more likely to undermine the significance of his previous run / departure.

I think it's more likely an Eccleston part would be written for a future show now that he's shown a willingness to consider the role. It's too bad that it's not going to happen for the 50th anniversary special, but it's not a show stopper that he's not participating...

...and to be honest, some of the corny ""interactions"" of the Doctors in *The Five Doctors* probably did more to undermine things with nostalgia and funny in-jokes rather than make a clever and tightly-plotted storyline. You might argue something similar with other multi-Doctor cross-overs (e.g. Terrance Dick's *The Eight Doctors* novel, or to a lesser extent *Time Crash* or *The Two Doctors*) but there's a very fine line in having these personalities interact versus taking a dump all over the story continuity of a time traveller and his companions.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt;GDP did well during those years

GDP is fundamentally flawed though. I hate it when people refer to GDP as 'the economy' i.e. how 'the economy' was revitalised under Thatcher. The majority of people were worse off financially after Thatcher's reforms, but as long as 'the economy' flourished, all is good.

&gt;http://www.neweconomyworkinggroup.org/visions/living-wealth-indicators/gdp-flawed-measure-progress

&gt;Then there is also the fact that GDP takes no account of how income is distributed. There could be complete income equality with everyone's purchasing power growing equally. Or the society may be divided between a small minority of the extremely affluent and a majority of the extremely destitute---or anything in between. GDP gives no clue one way or the other. Growth in the incomes of a few billionaires can produce impressive growth in GDP even as a majority of people starve.

&gt;Underlying all these deficiencies is the simple fact that GDP is based on market transactions, which means GDP is a measure of the rate at which money is flowing through the economy. Anything that increases the flow is therefore treated as a positive, even if it is clearly a negative for the society. Furthermore, because money metrics make no distinction between phantom wealth and real wealth, activities that generate profits from purely financial transactions unrelated to the creation of anything of real value count as additions to GDP and presumably to national well-being.

&gt;That is why restructuring the economy to shrink the manufacturing sector and grow the financial sector could appear to make us richer as a nation, when in fact it reduced our capacity to produce real things in favor of giving priority to generating profits from the exchange of worthless financial assets. 

My point is, an increase in GDP doesn't denote progress or improvement; it is not necessarily a good thing. In this case, it almost certainly wasn't.",0,1365478365,null,0,1365479790,0,c9bdibz,t3_1by87x,t1_c9bdibz,t1_c9b9ydk,null,1431623781,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

What you should know, which most Redditors don't seem to be telling you is that unions were becoming extremely strong and strikes were happening every weekend. Picketing factories and work sites happened very frequently. Crippling the industry and forcing entire operations to shut down. The constant threat of dropping tools with and having unreasonable demands had businesses balls in a metaphorical vice-grip.

Margaret Thatcher introduced laws to make it difficult for unions to strike and picket. Suddenly a lot of the power the unions (the working class) had and dwindled and their demands weren't going to be answered. 

This caused a bitter wedge between the working class and herself.

Remember she was elected into office three times and was the longest running prime minister in the 20^th century, winning a place in many of the top 100 important/greatest people/women of all time awards.

She was a very strong, no nonsense women (hence the nickname 'Iron Lady') which helped with her popularity for her second(I think?) term after winning the Falklands War (islands that the Argentinian government wanted to reclaim). 

A lot of her policies were controversial and were always met with a strong resistance. Her final downfall was a tax imposed on housing which ultimately led to her forced resignation when another party member.

A lot of us on this website weren't even born or can remember her in power and I believe many users here are inheriting the hatred from previous generations and pop culture.

She was one of the few conservative MP's to support the decriminalisation of male homosexuality (back in the '60s) *but* also supported legislature disallowing schools to promote homosexuality acceptance (or something along those lines). Thatcher also voted in favor of abortion.

I've only typed this up to give you the other perspective. She is dearly loved by a lot of people as well as hated by many others. I have no opinion on the matter because I wasn't even born when she left office and I think it would be improper to harbor so much hatred to something I never experienced.

_____________________________

**An answer to your question:**
I was born in Cumbria, England as was my father (who is a Margaret Thatcher supporter even though he comes from very humble beginnings). He saw her as someone who took a stand to the detrimental unions who managed to cause many disruptions throughout the country.

My grandfather is the opposite, he disliked the woman a lot and saw her to be cruel and unsympathetic to miners (even though he earned less than them).

____________________________________________


All I can say is read up on her yourself. Going to Reddit for an opinion is no different than going to /r/politics. Some of the things I'm reading here are vile, distasteful and disrespectful to a dead woman. The comparisons to a dictator are probably the most disturbing.

The difference between left and right here (though no longer, since New Labour) is a fundamentally different view of capitalism: economic leftists came from the Marxist heritage and expound theories like [Exploitation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value) and the tendency of capitalism toward cyclical crises of increasing severity. Whereas Thatcherites come from the Neo-classical economic tradition (and the one that's still utterly dominant in economics today), where the relation between workers and bosses is both voluntary and mutually-beneficial, this view also holds that--without intervention from unions, government or other outside agencies--capitalism tends towards equilibrium. Thatcher was particularly enamoured with [Milton Friedman](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534387/Thatcher-praises-Friedman-her-freedom-fighter.html) and his tying of capitalism, economic freedom and personal freedom.

In the first view, capitalism is exploitative, unstable and at the least needs constant intervention to keep it from polarising society into two groups of extremely rich and extremely poor before imploding into crisis then fascist or communist revolution. In the second view, capitalism utilises a voluntary system of exchange (the 'free market') to achieve an optimal distribution of scarce goods and services; and in the Friedmanite view, this economic freedom is tightly bound to personal freedoms, too.

Hopefully this explains why people holding these two opposing viewpoints usually end up talking past each other, which is what we see in the video (though Thatcher is far more eloquent at getting her point across). :)",0,1365480472,null,0,false,0,c9bea4n,t3_1by87x,t1_c9bea4n,t3_1by87x,null,1431623418,34,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,34

true,demostravius,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Depends, the UK is a great place. I love it, however the job prospects are at the moment, slim. So if you can both find secure work go for it, if not it may be best to stay put. 

Clearly it varies from person to person, some people are going to prefer the US style of living, others are going to prefer the UK style. No-one can really tell you which is better because opinions vary wildly. 

The UK has security with healthcare and high quality education, prices are not so bad but are higher than they used to be. Fuel is expensive so is housing, but if you have enough of a budget to cover housing food is cheap (not as much as the US though). 
Some of the bigger selling points vary depending on where you move. I live in the country so fresh air, nice people, still within driving distance of towns for things like the cinema and shopping.
It's hard to have a night out though due to the trains shutting down before midnight and taxis are not so cheap.

I lived in Cheltenham for a few years and the ease of access to everywhere was great, walking distance of everything, even London was only a few hours car/train. Plenty of bars/pubs, shops, cinema whatever else you need really. It was more noisy but I always felt safe. The UK is a very safe place to be, regardless of what the media says. Crime is at an all time low, clearly it's higher in certain places (My house was robbed twice in 3 years, keep your windows closed/locked if you are in the centre of a town).

I personally love the weather, the scenery and even the people. We have high quality internet and it's fairly cheap, we have some of the best public transport in the world (trains are expensive though). On the side of politics the US scares the crap out of me, a government bought by corporations...

Contrary to popular belief food here is excellent, in many ways better than the states. From my (limited) experience in the US, food there tends to be bulk and cheap. Shocking bad cheese/chocolate and very little variety. The UK offers lots of variety and high quality, the home of Cheddar, Stilton and thousands of others, we have superb chocolate and if you are a fan of Ales I recommend the pubs (our larger sucks, but then so does US lager, buy European/Indian is my advise!).
Most importantly we have good baked beans.

If you don't have or are not planning on kids soon, you could always do a test run. Try the UK for a year or two, decide which you like best and make a decision based on that.

Finally, do a LOT of research into where you want to live. The UK is small but has even more cultural variety than the US, everywhere you go will be different. You may struggle at first to understand certain accents (looking at you Northern UK!) but everyone gets used to it eventually. The North is cold, Wales is stunning, the South is fields, London is huge and Cornwall has cornish people in it.

People WILL poke fun, mocking one another is a very strong part of British culture, it's done in good faith, being able to laugh at oneself is a sign of strength of character. Just give as good as you get, and try to distinguish between jest and just plain rude (this varies person to person). From what I have been told Americans often find Britons rather closed off, and I suppose this can be true. We are often reserved until we know you. 

Best of luck!",0,1365482991,null,0,false,0,c9bf416,t3_1bymef,t1_c9bf416,t3_1bymef,null,1431623026,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

She shouldn't exist and yet she's in random places throughout time and space. And she's there *deliberately* because what she's doing to the Doctor is very, very important. 

In her first appearance, she erased the Doctor from the Dalek hive mind. They called him the Predator of the Daleks and she took that away. She stopped him from being the genocidal monster that even the most evil things in the universe were afraid of. You remember the Wedding of River Song? The scene where the Doctor comes up to an injured Dalek and calls himself the Devil? That's important. On more than one occasion, he's seen himself as truly evil. And Clara took that away.

In her second life, Clara took away his grief about Amy and Rory. Or, rather, she stopped him from mourning. What were the odds that she'd know the exact word to get the Doctor moving again? Pond. That's no coincidence.

And then there's this life. This last episode. The Doctor tried to test her. He wasn't just being a dick when he refused to give up his own sentimental things. He was trying to figure her out. But, in the end, she made him give up his memories and talk about his own past (both his epic speech and his mention of his granddaughter).

true,Kickzors,present,"He's in the game now! ","As an American, it's insane even thinking about how I have gotten to this point. I didn't play football when I was young and I even remember thinking it was boring or something along those lines. Probably similar to what most Americans feel today, likely because it's not a sport rooted in our culture and they just don't get it. 

The first time I can remember rooting for a team even was cheering for the USA in the Women's World Cup (think it was 99, Mia Hamm/Brandi Chastain etc.). Thinking about it, the reason I began to watch was largely because my girlfriend at the time played and I was able to go watch her a few times and talk with her about it. This was around middle school age (I think I was in 6th grade) and I could have played for my school but my family owned a business and I was only able to play one sport (basketball). She made me so much more ""aware"" of the sport and because of her I began watching what little I could get my hands on (exclusively international matches because that's all that was available). 

And so I began to love football while cheering for the USA in international competitions. I watched the USA men and women play whenever I could, which wasn't that often. Even then I had no idea about the extent of football and the opportunities to watch the sport on television were so few. There is just such a huge barrier to entry; watching these international matches (the men in particular), you hear about the leagues they play in but I just had no idea when or where I could watch them or learn about it. As I'm sure of all you know, watching top-tier football can be quite a challenge depending on where you live. Of course technology has advanced so much since then and watching games has become easier than ever.

My first memory of Chelsea is a flag hanging in a window. In the summer of 2008, after my sophomore year of college, I moved out my dorm room into an apartment a few miles away. I worked on campus  as a student part time doing IT for the College of Engineering and I drove in everyday, parking on a side street so I didn't have to pay for a parking pass. Every single day I would walk down the same street past this house with a Chelsea flag in the window. By this time I had a lot more info about things but it just became engrained in me and really sparked my curiosity. I think seeing that flag everyday might just have been one of the best things to ever happen to me. 

Quick aside, when the curiosity really hit, I remember having to do an intense amount of research just for the world of football to actually make sense to me.  I am referring to the tiered league systems (relegation/promotion), all the different cups, European football, etc.  I was used leagues like the NFL, MLB,  and NBA. One league where the best of the best play. Possibly another reason its hard to get into for Americans.

It all culminated during the 2008 Champion's League Final, Chelsea v. United. As far as memory serves, it is the first club match that I remember watching (although I might have seen some games leading up to it, can't remember). I remember sitting there, watching that game. I had fallen in love with the club before I ever saw her. When Terry missed and van der Sar saved, the emotions that followed, I knew this was my team. 

It became much easier when I started grad school as I met a now close friend of mine from Jordan who loves the game and has played since he could walk. He is a United fan and I remember the first [game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1zXdDGM4hs) I watched with him on March 1st, 2011 when Chelsea came back from one down to beat United 2-1. 
He has taught me so much more about the game and has made me love it even more. Just having a friend to watch games with is amazing. Chelsea till I die.

I decided to do a bunch of research on what players could do what and who was on what team.  As I was watching goals, games, and determining who all would make for an indestructible team.  Throughout this process I came to find that most of the players I liked were on Chelsea or had played for Chelsea.


So I started paying more attention to what was actually going on in the soccer world at the time and became completely enwrapped in the sport.  I've always liked sports and had favorite teams, but this was the first time I found myself really following a team both on and off the field.

true,Doomslicer,eng-norfolk,Norwich,"I didn't know much at 17 either. One of the best parts of going to uni was meeting, befriending, and living with a group or other intelligent inquisitive people. We became the kind of house that was non-stop discussing news, history, politics, etc., and through this I think everyone involved gained a lot of information and insight.

Things I was *definitely* not taught in school, critical thinking, logical argument, how to reasonably debate with people, recent history in any kind of depth... I learned at uni. And not from being at uni, but being surrounded by a small gang of science students.

Of course, we spent too much time on all this wank and vidya, and our grades suffered a bit as a result. But I don't think I'd change it much if I had the chance to go back and alter things.

This stuff should be core to education, but it isn't. I learned it from being surrounded by similar inquisitive people for 3 years, in nightly living room chats, fuelled by caffeine and armed with laptops. But that isn't exactly something everyone is going to get - especially with tuition fees now triple what I paid. Living in a house with similar people during your late teens and early 20's may help, but that's hardly a reliable method.

As for the majority of people? They just don't care. They're either (unbelievably) content, or simply don't think it makes a difference if they vote or not. With the current two and a half party system, gerrymandering for seats, etc, it's hard to disagree.

What really boggles the mind is the 'no' vote to the AV referendum. People were given one chance to move our political system on from its current pathetic state, and they rejected it, either out of spite (screw you, libdems), ignorance (what?) or complete lack of logical thought (The 'no' campaign used illogical arguments and outright lies). Anyone who rejected it because it wasn't 'True proportional representation' doesn't realise that this no verdict will be seen as a demonstration that we don't want voting reform at all, giving the two and a half parties carte blanche to continue with the current absurd system for another fifty years.

But in the meantime, people are apathetic because of our stupid electoral system and the pretty much identical politicians it produces, and the stupid shuffling of boundaries and 'safe seats'. And I guess people are just lazy. Politics is 'hard' and 'boring' so noone pays attention to it. Noone wants to be a nerd so they make sure they don't actually learn too much. And whenever the idea of going to look into this stuff more in depth, learned helplessness has kicked in - the mere mention of politics triggers frustration, annoyance, anger, boredom - because they don't understand, and they don't want to have to understand.

Thatcher did not bring down the USSR. Regan did not bring down the USSR. [It brought itself down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_%281985%E2%80%931991%29). The west's involvement is a footnote at best. 

Fact is that Regan was lying about the power of the USSR because Donald Rumsfeld was telling him porky-pies. His logic was ""we can't find any cool new tech weapons, so they must  be so super awesome that they've hidden them very well away"". Details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Weinberger#Secretary_of_Defense). Regan benefited from this as he got to appear tough to an enemy that was collapsing under it's own hubris. It was all posturing, he is an actor by trade after all.

Yes, but against the UK! Thatcher was utterly anti-Europe to the core. It's why Heath resigned and iirc it played a huge role in the coup against her within the Tory party.

Fast forward to Present Day - The Dude abides to his time lord, but still passive aggressive, self: haphazardly bantering with time and space; wearing the robe; White Russian and Sonic Vaporizer in hand; just The Dude in the rug.

Unlike The Doctor, he's not compelled to do the right thing or make grand heroic gestures.  After all, he did dodge the Time War and hid out in Venice, CA until it was long over.  However, on occasion, he is confronted with various moral dilemmas along the way and he, either unknowingly or begrudgingly, casually influences people/events so sometimes things work out for that warm fuzzy ending (or not).

Smaller yet still famous acts play at the hmv picturehouse on Lothian road. Glasgow is more popular however and is only an hours bus journey away. 

For unsigned acts there is more of a fledgling music scene. Couple of pubs in the centre host unsigned gigs  (bannermans, wee red bar, whistlebinkies and the basement bar at teviot student union immediately come to mind) you will also find lots of cover artists in pubs doing a wide range of music depending on the clientele. Again however Glasgow is more alive musically from my personal experience. More music venues and more nightlife help this along. Hope my limited experience helps and welcome to our city!

I generally am envious of the second amendment, its idea and ideology. The idea of self sovereignty, protection and private citizenship it seems to represent apeal to me. The effects of its abuse however don't. 

I personally feel the argument , as stated by peter, boils down to this:

&gt; do you remove the liberty for all because some can't handle the responsibility?

In the case of firearms, I would say no. Lots of people would say yes. I feel that's the fundamental difference which ultimately makes most debate pointless.

But maybe I'm just bias.

I also do not agree with the idea that the constitution is just an old bit of paper to be ignored. I feel there are bad and good points to a fixed constitution and what we have, but I would rather outdated laws be harder to remove than our current situation which seems to have our civil liberties at the will and whim of the foaming mouth majority who have shown time and time again to be all to easily manipulated by fear and anger.

I do have to say that the only time I question AVB's tactics are when he plays Bale in the centre whilst Lennon is out - as it means we lose all natural width and pace on the wings, which has led to disappointing results (4-1 against Inter and 2-2 against Basel) 

Having so many options in Attacking mid means we should not play Bale Out of possision - When playing on the left he is deadly for 3 reasons:

* 1. He can cross and make fantastic runs and
* 2. He can cut inside and get a shot off, like he has been doing all season. 
* 3. When he does drop inside, other players are already pre-occupied with marking the other midfielders/strikers and it gives him enough space and time on the ball to create something magical.

You could use one of Agencies that will provide you with work, but you are going to be somewhere else , everyday and they going to rip you off.

Living is expensive , you could rent a room in a shared house. Conditions depends on so many factors that it is impossible to tell how much it would be but300-500 Pounds a month isn't anything special.
That offcourse is also dependant on area you will settle in. Far North or South is 1.5-4 times cheaper than central West or East London. Basicly , closer to the Westminister, the more expensive it gets.

Works councils have a legal role in German labour relations, and if you fuck with a works council you can expect to be fucked hard in court, this makes labour relations much smoother over there. Not that shit doesn't happen there but it happens far less. 

The CBI are as big a threat to labour relations in this country in my honest opinion. They lobby hard on behalf of businesses. 
A couple of examples I want to bring up are, example 1) Germany has a long carnival weekend each year, the CBI would throw a fucking fit of lost revenue numbers around if anyone suggested the UK has an annual long weekend dedicated to dancing in the streets in fancy dress and drinking. 2) has our reluctance to implement the European working hours directive, again virulently opposed by the CBI who regularly make calls for everyone to work longer hours actually made us more efficient or benefitted us as a society? Its implemented across Europe and doesn't seem to have made any noticeable difference on economic performance. It has of course meant that people trade their own lives for work, and for many working 50-60 hour weeks is the norm in the UK. I think for many work versus home life is completely unbalanced, put simply we work too many hours in this country and a gradual erosion of labour rights are to blame for that.

true,VikingHedgehog,mcgannnew,new McGann,"To be honest - Idris just brings to mind recollections of a sort of Helena Bonham Carter crazy Victorian lady. It would be hard for me, in a sea of cosplayers to pick out a Mrs. Lovett, vs. an Idris from memory. The styles are similar, the real difference is in the colors.

That said - I think this is a very forgiving cosplay in terms of exact accuracy. I get the feeling you can even find most bits you'd need to pull it together fast at a thrift store.  Ruffled skirt, semi-deconstructed and a corset top. Add the crazy hair and you're pretty much done. 

I think almost all people would have to actually be carrying a picture of Idris to be able to realize it wasn't exactly correct. You should be able to easily modify a top by using different textured fabrics and what not. In my semi-professional opinion. (I worked for a VERY large U.S. theatre costume company for some time.) I would say it should be fairly quick and easy to come up with. 

THAT SAID - if you need patterns - I find Simplicity to generally be the easiest to follow and there are a ton of steampunk-esque ones out there. Just giving it a very quick look - 
[For skirt, needs modified or hiked up. Also could use pieces of the top as well.](http://www.simplicity.com/p-7517-misses-steampunk-costume.aspx#t-0)
[Long sleeved bodice with a low neckline](http://www.simplicity.com/p-1769-costumes.aspx)

That was just the quickest of patterns picks. The skirt you could just add more ruffled layers to and simply hike it up higher in the front than the back.  Though it looks like the bustle is attached. I can't remember if Idris has one or not. You might have nix that. 

That bodice has some structure to it so if you just make it from the right sort of crazy, textured fabrics and add the lace and bows at the top I think it would pass quite well. 

It seems to me that it mostly comes down to finding fabrics in the right color scheme and that have texture. Looking at her costume texture is the biggest thing that stands out. Think velvets, brocades, upholstery type fabrics, laces, netting, that sort of stuff.

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"I've got some similar stories to this - I knew a Polish guy who was living in a 3 bed flat with his entire family (him, his sister, his brother, all of his neices and nephews and occasionally their mother and father would appear although I think they lived elsewhere) - they were always super happy, although their English was poor at the time, and he once told me what he was being paid to do BILINGUAL I.T. support, and it was below minimum wage!!  I thought that was shocking and I said to him ""Man...can you not go elsewhere and get more?"" and he said that his employers treated him like shit, but he was still earning 3 times what he would have earned in Poland, and it was paying his mortgage on his flat there, with enough left over for him to pool it together with his family so they could eat and pay for basic services, and also save a little too - he said that there was nothing for him in Poland, although he still loved his country, he could make far more money here.

Another example is a couple of girls I know who had moved here from Slovakia - we met because a load of us thought they were super hot but over time we just became really good friends, and I still speak to one of them - she wanted to work in fashion and ended up in London, after doing a series of really shit jobs in Bedfordshire/Hertfordshire (as I understand, I don't know exactly what she did) but both of these girls work about a bajillion times harder with more dedication than any British person I know - perhaps there is something to be said for the fact that if you come from a country where there is less opportunity (I don't know if Slovakia is that bad tbh...nearest I've been is Bratislava) then the impetus to work hard and better yourself is greater maybe?

I think I'd work harder if I moved abroad than I would if I stayed here - maybe there's a certain complacency that comes with staying in your comfort zone in that regard.

On a level though, I do think these girls, AND this Polish guy I know, as well as many other people who I've met from the EU do generally have a better work ethic and I'd say they're at least level pegging, if not marginally more intelligent and diligent than your average Brit.

I guess it comes down to ""Would you be happy working for a European?"" because that's what will happen in the fullness of time if Boris is right. I honestly wouldn't mind, just because they're not British doesn't mean they're automatically evil.

I'm glad I did, as they showed me how to remove and reinsert the visor (and practice on another lid) and liners, as well as changing the interior cheek pads for 3mm narrower ones which were a perfect fit with my speakers in under the liner.

I've left university, have a degree and I'm on minimum wage, so you're making huge generalisations.

What the problem is is that immigrants are willing to accept a much lower quality of life, which is why they work shit jobs, with shit hours, for shit wages. 

If I offered you a minimum wage job, with shit hours where I'd treat you like shit the entire time, would you take it over being on benefits? No. 

If you didn't have benefits would you take the job? Yes.

Now imagine a world where no-one will take the job that is shit hours, with a shit wage and a shit manager. Employers would have to offer better wages and better working conditions or face a staff shortage.

I agree there are British people for whom benefits have become a way of life, and potentially will do for their children too, but generally they lack the skills/education to do anything (government's fault) and the ambition to succeed (how can they succeed without thinking they can amount to anything?).

That's an odd statement to make. If you don't want anyone on that wage, raise the minimum wage. 

&gt; the living conditions for migrants means that accepting poor wages is easier for them, several crammed into a flat

This is a problem. Agree completely. But here's the thing, what if it's voluntary? Their living conditions might be terrible, but what if the alternative is worse? How does it make sense to say ""Sorry, you can't come and work here because it wouldn't improve your situation enough."" They might live in these conditions, not because they have to, but to save money. Every penny saved here could be a relative fortune back home.

&gt; a younger Brit wanting to live on their own and maybe have a holiday can't do that on minimum wage.

So? How does this affect immigration? If you want brits on minimum wage to be able to afford their own residence and a holiday then the thing to do is make housing cheaper.

Wealth lacks any sense of scale proportion, zoom in on any continent, city or large town and you'll find a power law of wealth and earnings. Such distributions are often termed scale-free in that at no level or in no community is there a characteristic statistic such as a nice average.

By mapping the middle point of earning you're not really showing anything useful because you're still thinking in terms of how far you are from this hypothetical middle point. In reality there is no middle point, all this shows you is the rate of inflation.

If you want a useful measure of wealth distribution it would be how easy it is to go from one wealth bin e.g. from ¬£10,000-¬£15,000 to ¬£15,001 - ¬£20,000. The steepness of the power law gives you an indication of this. Under the thatcher/Reagan trade liberalisation policies the power law got far steeper (e.g. the rich got richer)

I'm pretty sure that a few days prior to the sinking the UK sent another message to Argentina stating that the TEZ wasn't the total extent of the UK's area of operations, simply that that was a zone in which, in the UK's opinion at least, any vessels could be engaged without warning.

When interviewed after the war the Argenintian commanders generally agreed that they felt the sinking wasn't exceptional - they were aware of the danger and didn't feel that being outside of the TEZ rendered them immune to attack.  Perhaps in principle they *could* have, but I've not read anything to suggest anyone actually did.

true,madtweeter,uk,Hampshire,"As a member of Girl Guiding, I think that this is a minority view. Certainly in my area we have not been asked to contribute our thoughts on the matter. However, recently, I have noticed from the social media of Girl Guiding that there is quite a(n unnecessary) feminist approach as the company 'evolves'.

Speaking as a female in her late-20s, who has been subjected to The Sun on and off over the last million of years, it's simple: if I don't want to look at boobs, I don't look at Page 3. Seeing them has not made me feel like I should look some way and the model is hardly being forced into getting her kit off: it is her choice to do so. Personally, I wouldn't do what she's doing, but it is up to her. Everyone knows The Sun has boobs in it so if girls really are so offended maybe they could ask their parents not to buy it - not try and change the contents of what has been in that paper ever since I can remember.

Sadly, I thought Girl Guiding stood for guiding the girls down their paths and supporting the decisions they make. Who knows: today's Guides might want to be tomorrow's Page 3 model.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"I think it's important to point out that *this is already part of the national curriculum*. The problem is that it work very well. Most people will say that other things are more important (and to be fair, they have a point) and thus when they make the school time tables for each student/form group they go ""can I fit political studies in here? No. Ok, well I guess it doesn't go in"".

Most of us agree that politics should be taught, but what we normally don't ask is: What should we replace to fit politics in? School timetables are already over burdened for almost all year groups so we can't just go cramming another subject in. Not only are timetables full, but I doubt we'd manage to get people to learn it if it's not given the appropriate time.

If I was education secretary I'd drop PE in a heart beat as I think it fails in every single way it can (doesn't keep people fit, doesn't teach people how to be fit, is a wast of time and money). It could be replaced by some sort of after school thing that may or may not be compulsory at certain times throughout the year. I just don't see any benefit from having *compulsory* physical education during school hours. Maybe have it optional? (I did genuinely find PE fun, I just think it's a wast of time)

One last thing worth noting regarding how long it takes to learn: I'm coming to the end of AS-government and politics. We've covered all the major areas of government from constitutions, parties, pressure groups, parliament, executive, judiciary, multi level governance (ie local, Scottish and EU gov). So we covered all that but it does still fail to address a few things like political theory (I think that's A2-level).

I spent a few years doing monthly maintenance inspections around various DHL/TNT distribution warehouses (I've done warehouse work too; I know how soul-crushingly dull it is). The majority of the staff were agency workers employed to do unloading/loading, sort packaging, manually scan barcodes, etc. It‚Äôs all unskilled, minimum wage stuff.

The problem these companies had was retaining native workers; they'd stay only a few weeks, and then the companies would have to pay the agencies again to replace them. The Polish workers on the other hand were fantastic; every month over the two years I'd go back, and the same faces would be standing at the same points, passing packages through. Eventually most of the workforces at these sites became Polish, and it was fairly common for safety signage to be in Polish rather than English.

true,VikingHedgehog,mcgannnew,new McGann,"Best: There are a lot that I love, but I think Midnight sticks out the most. I love how Doctor focused it was. It seemed like it offered a wonderful little insight into his brain. I found it charming as well as terrifying. It showed the very good as well as the very bad in humans, all in one episode. Absolutely loved that one. Others that stick out in my mind are Father's Day, Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, The Girl in the Fireplace, The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit, and The Doctor's Wife.

Worst: Love and Monsters. Really hated that one. I thought it was creepy and not in a good way. I could only sit through it once. Even on re-watches of every other episode in New Who, I still skip that one. There are lots of ""meh"" episodes that I sort of just forget about a lot, but that is the only one I just refuse to watch again. 

I do enjoy the 9th and 10th Doctors more than the 11th. Rose is my favorite companion, so by default I tend to enjoy series 1 and 2 the most. I really liked Donna too though and I didn't dislike Martha either. The Ponds were fine, but they sort of wore on me after a while. I do not like River. Clara is yet to be decided.

It would end up being a boring, pointless exercise that taught us very little and didn't end up improving our understanding of the situation. You only get that when you yourself are interested in carrying it further. School is designed to give you that ability to investigate things which you find interesting

2) The selection bias of teachers. On average, teachers tend to be lefties, moderates and progressives. You aren't going to get an unbiased depiction of political workings, especially during strikes or austerity. Consequently, the reaction would be quick and brutal. Finally it would cause trouble between teachers and family members, particularly if they are extremists, leading to them either not getting the adequate support from home or the kids being withdrawn from schools.

3) You would be taking time away from somewhere else which is more important, like maths, science, history or english, which are actually needed to function within wider society. If we get to add stuff to the curriculum, things like basic household budgets, food economics and work experiance would be far more valuable than a class about politics that people will just ignore.

Tl;DR, politics is pointless, divisive, and you'll learn what you need at uni or on your own dime anyway. Apathetic people will just blow off the class or become more disheartened. You won't get any of the benefits, but you'll get lots of the costs.

On one hand being greeted by a giant pair of tits every time you open the morning paper is pretty uplifting and kind of puts you in a good frame of mind to deal with whatever sensationalised stories of nuclear threat, paedophiles and economic disaster that are put in front of us......

I mean every day we are faced with some horrible stories highlighting the worse in human nature and a lovely pair of air brushed tits helps this particularly bitter medicine to go down much easier. It's like your still blinded by jugs and half thinking about them while reading the bad shit.....now that's the plus side 

On the negative side....well it's 2013 and not 1975 (as much as I'd like to be) and England is a different world these days. Long gone are the politically incorrect days of yesteryear.....I mean Benny Hill would have been put on sex offender's register long ago (and the dole after his milk round would have come to end because of corporate giants like tesco making his business model redundant) and Robin Askwith would have long since died of aids, broken down in a halfway house......the 70's ladies man chasing the young skirt around is now a figure of hate and is routinely demonised in the wake of the Savile scandal

These days women fill a much bigger role in our society than just looking pretty and being home makers and with women filling more executive roles are earning equal pay as men for the most part (still a way to go) well those daily tits tend to undermine their struggle and their place in modern society. 

Also we can't forget the negative impact that page 3 must have on women's self image and I can only imagine how having an implausibly giant and air brushed cock on the paper every day would make me feel about myself (insert own joke about your least favourite columnist being an air brushed cock you have to deal with on daily basis)...

These aren't real women they are impossibly perky and young and photoshopped within a inch of their life and it's shit like this that has left a whole generation of young women who don't have academic aspirations to look up to risible people like Jordan......and this doomed generation think that fake tan, breast implants and a date raping footballer on your arm is what the good life is about. (Case in point the woman who had the NHS tit job who became more hated than Ian Huntly and Jimmy Savile in the last couple of weeks) 

So yeah my take on Page 3 in a nutshell ""I do enjoy a nice pair of breasts as much as the next man.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The problem is actually much more simple, so lets take an example of a college course with 100 students who all graduate.

By definition there is a sliding scale of capabilities across them. In the past, business in the UK had that 100 people to choose from, so they almost all got jobs. But today, companies have thousands to choose from because of the EU, so the 100 students can be ranked from 1 to 100.

So nowadays, after maybe 60 of them have been hired, companies then start getting tempted by the applications coming from abroad. If any of those applicants would have been in the top 60 of their country, they are now also ahead of the remaining 40 from the UK. Imagine if the applicants are in the top 10 from their country, the bottom 40 from here have no chance.

You are no longer competing within your own country, you are now also competing with everyone in Europe, and to some extent, the world. It's not lazy Brits vs Hard-Working migrants, it's a competition of skills. If the top people from other countries come here they will obviously get the jobs over average people here.

When it comes to unskilled jobs, the huge difference is an immigrant is willing to live a much more miserable life than we because it is a step up from their country, a chance to improve their life and the lives of their families. For someone from the UK, to live in the conditions that many immigrants do would be a drop in living standards - from having a room in a house, to sharing a room in a house (with 1 or more roommates) for example.

The only thing you know about me is that I think this. Making assumptions about other people's thoughts is not a good thing. 

Shall we try having a proper discussion? You never know, we both might learn something. 

&gt; when people like you eventually get overlooked at a job interview purely because 'you're local' you may change your opinion.

I'm not selfish enough to take a position based on whether it affects me or not. Maybe you are, but I'd rather build a system from behind a [Veil of Ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance).

&gt; they're keeping wages, working standards low and working hours longer

We have to ask how are any of those things solved by limiting immigration and if so, is limiting immigration the best way to solve them? 

Immigration causes wages to decrease. Well, it increases the supply of labour for certain jobs so, yes. But it seems that we have a surplus of labour anyway at the moment so unless there are more immigrants in work than Britons out, you're not going to have an effect on wages. 

Low working standards? Low working standards are low working standards regardless of who is doing the work. How would replacing immigrant workers with british solve this? If you want good working standards, make appropriate laws and enforce them. This would benefit all industries not just those populated by immigrants. 

An analogy; if a particular area in a city has a problem with gangs assaulting people, you don't ban the elderly or those unable to defend themselves from entering the area. Doing so wouldn't fix the problem, the gang will just change tactics. No, you increase policing. Likewise, if bosses are trying to exploit their workers they will do so regardless of how well the workers can protect themselves. You improve the situation for everyone by targetting the bosses, not the workers.

This covers working hours as well. If someone is being exploited, you target the exploiter.",0,1365511177,null,0,false,0,c9bjpz9,t3_1bz7ha,t1_c9bjpz9,t1_c9bj5dz,null,1431620781,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I have seen plenty of comments such as ""there won't be another like her"" and of course they're correct, no government in future will ever be able to quick-fix the economy by selling off all of the nation's assets in one fell swoop again.

A lot of the checks-and-balances in the supply/demand and free market system start to break as we globalise our markets. Tax havens allow the corporates to dodge tax preventing us from funding the society they were founded in, importing/exporting labour costs resulting in no work for our low skilled and those able to take advantage of this can crush local businesses.

I think there's something unhealthy when you have people working here and sending money ""back home"" as it's worth an awful lot more having a minimum wage job here. All it does is drive down the (private business's) wage bill making the jobs less appealing to our unemployed.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"What I want to know is to what extent immigrant workers are willing to take worse employment conditions because their life working here does not have to be permanent.

If you look at a job and you think the wage is essentially crap compared to what you know you can do and get, you would be less inclined to take that job as you have to live off that wage and you may not think that the job has long term prospects. Under normal economic times you would probably skip over it and not care.

However, immigrant workers know they are better in that job than back home and there are typically existing communities they can integrate into somewhere or other, so they can treat it like a working holiday of kinds and accept the poor wage. They can eventually go home, so those working conditions are not permanent. For the British worker however, those conditions would be permanent.

I would like to see better wages and conditions for all workers.

But when the Doctor erased Dr. Simeon, the Great Intelligence said that he didn't need him anymore because he had found something better, specifically the Doctor.  

So since TGI is now leeching off of the Doctor, it's created what the doctor was in need of, a companion.  Specifically, Clara.  I'm unsure how he created so many of her across time, but I'm sure that will come up eventually.

true,ctolsen,eu,London,"&gt; Thatcher was particularly enamoured with Milton Friedman and his tying of capitalism, economic freedom and personal freedom.

Economic and personal freedom would dictate that coops are a good thing. If they can survive and compete in the marketplace, they have every right to live and should be considered a viable model. 

In a strictly technical sense (ie. ignoring the economic gains of personal freedoms like migration, education etc.) free markets create wealth because they allocate resources efficiently. It so happens that the chaos of the market ‚Äì the ""invisible hand"" ‚Äì is much better at pushing people to do what they do best and invite competition. When your margins are high, more people will invest in that industry. When they are low, people will try to innovate to make them bigger, or invest other places to diversify.

A government can't do that, and at least as far as anyone has tried they've done a real shitty job at it. If John Lewis can make it, however, they've created wealth by innovation and by allocating resources correctly in the market. That means they're doing what the economic model wants them to do, and they have every right to be alive, ""socialist"" or not.

And frankly, as a free marketeer, I love these alternative models. Capitalism needs innovation too. While I think employee ownership often has the problem that employees make shitty business decisions, I'm all for being proved wrong or seeing a model where employees share the profits they create but don't create the problems they otherwise might ‚Äì specialization works for shareholders as well, not everyone is good at it.",0,1365516019,null,0,false,0,c9bkwe5,t3_1by87x,t1_c9bkwe5,t1_c9bk7we,null,1431620226,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Benitez made needed changes to our academy when he was here and we are now seeing the benefits of that with likes of Kelly, Suso and Sterling coming through and cementing their place in the first team squad, it will take several more years and far much more investment before we see anything like the amount of players coming out of the academy that we see at Barca or Ajax. 

For now I think we should look to try and do what United have done so successfully over the last 20 years, use the academy the fill out the first team squad with players for the bench and a couple for the starting XI, and use the money saved to invest in top quality players.

true,duckman273,1953,Juan Mata,"&gt;The man was a regular in the squad that had Ballack, Deco, Belletti, Essien, Lampard, and Joe Cole.

Exactly. More than half those players aren't good enough now. He's past it and doesn't suit our style any more. He was a good player, but right now he's training with the youth team and is out of practice, he hasn't played anywhere near premiership level in a year. 

I do find his treatment unfair:
&gt;I can understand his position though, he's comfortable in London and doesn't want to move and earn less.

But at the same time, I understand the club's position, this is basically Bogarde all over again. He doesn't have potential though, he's 32, past his peak and we've got at least 7 better options to play on left wing. Also I'll admit I did think Lampard was past it when AVB was here, under Benitez and Di Matteo he proved me wrong, still our best pairing is Ramires and Mikel. Lampard is aging and often ignores his defensive responsibilities, he's obviously desperate to score 3 more goals and that seems to be affecting his play as well.

I think the answer is: a huge extent. We all hear the stories of 10 people living in a 3 bed, and although anecdotal these stories must add up to a trend.

For someone from the UK, to live in a house with 3 bedrooms and share with 9 others is not acceptable. Therefore the extremely low wages on offer in these jobs are not worth it as they will spend a huge proportion of their wage on just getting a room to themselves (let alone families sharing houses which also happens).

On top of that, you are right. For many immigrants they have a chance to take this experience, move home and build something for themselves. For people from the UK, this is their life, and as social mobility is still low, they don't see a way out *so they don't let themselves get sucked in*.

I know I think probably doesn't make a modicum of difference to an uncaring, unintellectual pinko piece of shit like yourself, but I'd like to at least be left with a modicum of belief that here in the UK, we still display compassion to anyone, and we STILL extend every courtesy to our fellow Britons! Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself.

true,Owa1n,eng-Cornwall,DPRK,"If power is distributed between more people then the political process is far more democratic, most modes of socialism require increased democracy by the workers given voice via their unions, changes in work regulations and pay agreements can be argued better collectively rather than individually.

Worker's co-operatives usually have to start with small business as a group of workers at a factory or docks etc. don't have the capital to buy the means of production/service. This means any change is only going to happen for a large amount of people after the business has been built up to encompass many employees. Co-ops can also be good for less direct political agendas such as boycotting things they don't like by not using their products in their business, The Co-op (brand of shops etc.) doesn't sell products of Israel for example. 

Another thing about co-ops is that they work in smaller numbers, you can have three members of a co-op working perfectly fine in a large market, a trade union of three people in a factory of 1,000 non-unionised workers however would do nothing, unless these people held unique roles that no-one else could fill. 

Of course co-ops only work as any business does; where there's market space for it whereas unions can be used for gov't services such as police forces, firemen etc. Presuming these services aren't privatised.

Both unions and co-ops can function in both capitalist and socialist societies, socialism just means unions don't have to fight against wealthy business owners, functioning of co-ops work would remain relatively unchanged.

What I meant by they would operate as one big individual was this:

Imagine a capitalist society where all businesses are co-operatively owned and managed, instead of operating in the interests of one or two mighty shareholders they would operate in the interests of the workers, meaning there would be no owner vs. worker battle within each business and they would have to be united in competing with their rivals to survive in the market.",0,1365518653,null,0,false,0,c9bloh3,t3_1bxhxh,t1_c9bloh3,t1_c9biga1,null,1431619858,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

By 1989 their share had fallen to 7 percent. Over the same period, the amount of income taken by the richest fifth rose from 37 percent to 43 percent. The rich got richer; the poor got poorer. 

This is a claim about inequality, patently not about wealth. [You can still be richer and have a smaller share of the pie.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okHGCz6xxiw) One can of course legitimatly critisise this, but to conflate the two seems rather odd. 

&gt; Monetarism, the theory Thatcher adopted from American economist Milton Friedman, says the government should keep inflation low by restricting the money supply... She quickly abandoned her looser British version when it crashed the economy in the early 80s.

Well actually it's slightly more general, the argument is that money supply relative to demand will tend to correlate with short run macro economic output. Surely [the fact that inflation fell during the course of the 80s, and that interest rates were high](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/datablog/2013/apr/08/britain-changed-margaret-thatcher-charts) is indicative of continued monetarist influence?",0,1365518675,null,0,1365519315,0,c9blopi,t3_1bzo1m,t1_c9blopi,t3_1bzo1m,null,1431619855,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

* 1: How up-to-date are the media courses? Some people I've talked to, who studies media in England, tells me their school are using highly outdated equipment and Adobe CS2 (Abingdon and Whitney is you wonder).

* 2: Do the courses actually focus on media, or only to build a small foundation of media skills, in case you are going to study further?

* 3: How is the transport in/out of the city or to the college? I'm planning on living a little bit outside of Bristol and then take the train/car to get to school. Will this cause a lot of problem?

* 4: I'm very interested in media subjects, and was majorly disappointed when I started on a media school here in Norway, to find out that the students there were not at all interested in media. And people got into the school just to slack their way to college (Norwegian school system is a bit weird). Do you reckon I will get anything out of starting on college in England, or will I meet the same people there?

* 5: How many years are you in college before you go to university?

* 6: I want to have a course that will make me more experienced in media and creative production, and get the foundation to maybe go to university afterwards. And maybe meet people with the same passion as I have, is there any courses you recommend?

It isn't a cohesive collusive totalitarian faction or something. Paternal power is something that evolved out of the Stone Ages, where men would be expected to **die** defending their women, their villages. Men often hunted, while women gathered and nurtured the young. That evolved into the man working to earn in the town, while the woman managed the food and again raising the young at home. There's no overriding evilness to it, there was no grand plan to start a patriarchy. 

Feminism itself is not democratic because it believes pursuing the agenda in favour of the woman holding the power should continue even when parity has been achieved.

true,TheSkyhighatrist,irish,Nottingham Scouser,"During the conflict, and immediately afterwards everyone thought it was great. Maggie won a 3rd term on the back of it. There was a (in)famous interview that she did on the BBC on their evening news program. I think it was called Nationwide, and presented by Michael Barrett / Sue Lawley. Thatcher was doing over-the-phone  interviews, trying to big herself up and raise her popularity, she got nailed by a member of the public and showed what she really was about.

It was after the 3rd election in that all the discrepancies came out. When it was proved that the Belgrano was out of the TEZ she changed the story and continually claimed it was sunk because it was a danger to British ships. Shortly afterwards, it was shown that there wasn't a British ship within 100 miles (100km?) and the wording changed to 'a potential threat'. The truth being that it was Southwest of the Falklands, heading home on a bearing of 280, it posed absolutely no threat, and she sunk it for votes.

I think you might be surprised by the number of people (over 50's) who believe now that it wasn't a legitimate target, and she did it because, as the most unpopular prime-minister in post-war Britain, she did not stand a chance of winning an election without some dramatic event taking place, one which could cast her in the role of a hero.",0,1365521216,null,0,false,0,c9bminj,t3_1byawp,t1_c9bminj,t1_c9bk3dt,null,1431619463,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Objectification means making a woman less than a person. For example, showing them as [just something to grope](http://media-cache-is0.pinimg.com/550x/1a/8d/5d/1a8d5d18a86e887bd86c46757f4c7e57.jpg) or as [decoration in a menswear advert](http://media-cache-ec2.pinterest.com/550x/be/e5/ad/bee5adba6e5d1eb3752e9326c171873f.jpg) (also [here](http://media-cache-ec6.pinterest.com/550x/e1/e1/e5/e1e1e5fa273e5ce2fa82e9be61653a46.jpg) ) or [something to be dominated](http://media-cache-lt0.pinterest.com/550x/1e/92/4e/1e924e3bfe1c7d1b854195005ee5a62b.jpg). Often you do not even see the whole woman, sometimes just a shapely pair of legs or some tits or an ass.

Men, when sexualised in adverts, usually tie in to male power fantasies of being really strong and muscular and dominant. For the most part they are not degraded in these adverts because they are still being shown as agents and not depicted as victims of violence or sexually passive. Now [there](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md2tdbEDp31r0shcx.jpg) [are](http://www.freewebs.com/candaceharper/violencemen1.jpg) [exceptions](http://www.kongyuensing.com/cgi/20111008Abercrombie_and_Fitch-Singapore_orchard-road.jpg) but they are notable because they are unusual. We are not used to seeing men *actually* objectified and those pictures may make you feel uncomfortable. When women are objectified in adverts we are used to it so it does not seem weird and that is because the adverts feed back into the ingrained sexism in our society. Quite an amusing take on it [here](http://www.shortpacked.com/comics/2011-12-02-sexy.png)

Now the pendulum can be swung too far the other way, but it is important to realise that for the most part everything in media is generally targeted towards straight males. For example ""The Male Gaze"" refers to the fact that the camera looks in on a film as if it is a straight man; cameras often pan lovingly across a scantily clad woman, lingering on her tits or scrolling across her legs. Again, many exceptions to the rule but for the most part it bears out.

In a society where until quite recently [depicting violence against women as a discipline tool was a-ok](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TCTNes5hW0) and women are frequently depicted as [sexual objects](http://media-cache-ec4.pinterest.com/550x/05/c0/eb/05c0ebbe56bfaec4ea0fc6f0fba08779.jpg) and even sexual assault is [sometimes treated as a joke](http://media-cache-lt0.pinterest.com/550x/bd/a7/13/bda7139e5ad139b5894d69e503e8491e.jpg) while even [young girls are sexualised](http://media-cache-ec4.pinterest.com/550x/06/77/02/067702a532618da5ff830e13622261ac.jpg) it is little wonder that many young girls growing up end up with the [wrong ideas of who they should be](http://sherryx.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/beautiful.jpg) and on the other side of the coin rape culture grows amongst men (rape culture is seeing a guy trying to take a very drunk girl to a bedroom to have sex with her at a houseparty and feeling *awkward* about saying something, as an example).

The point is that you can do whatever you do now but faster or without worrying about congestion. There are a lot of people who do not have 3GB data limits today, they might only have 500MB or 1GB.

Plus EE are charging what they can because they know they're the only ones with LTE at the moment and there are people who will pay it to get it. Once other networks launch their services expect it to change. If you don't like the pricing, that's up to you, there are plenty of other networks who might offer what you want.

It is no different to 3G really, I remember it being a a premium price compared to 2G only plans (except 3 although back then, they weren't the cheap network they are today and they had no internet access from their phones) for a while.

(before you ask: I don't work for EE, I don't have an EE 4G plan or LTE phone (no LTE coverage for about 150 miles), I don't rate EE's pricing either but it needs more consideration than simplistic ""omg you'll use up the allowance in 5 milliseconds!"" type arguments)",0,1365521948,null,0,1365523417,0,c9bmrt9,t3_1bzbvo,t1_c9bmrt9,t1_c9bis8u,null,1431619343,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;UK research suggests that immigration has a small impact on average wages of existing workers but more significant effects along the wage distribution: **low-wage workers lose** while medium and high-paid workers gain. 

This seems to exactly agree with my point (I couldn't find your 0.5% over 10 years). I realised I should have clarified exploit: We are paying them lower wages than required for the job to be sustainable in the UK, but it is still more than they would get in their home country. The job is underpaid, but they don't notice it.

&gt;Research does not find a significant impact of overall immigration on unemployment in the UK, but the evidence suggests that immigration from outside the EU **could have a negative impact on the employment of UK-born workers**, especially during an economic downturn.

As h0m3r says already, this is a fallacious argument. [Appeal to tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_traditionhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition)

We've been an absolute monarchy for far longer than we've been a constitutional monarchy + democracy. If length of duration is a measure of the effectiveness of governance, then it's time to dissolve parliament , reinstitute the divine right of kings, and prepare the queen for her dual role as leader and warlord of the realm. (This may actually be a better system of governance than our current situation, put like that).


I'll just lay down the rest of the 'no' campaign here ;

* AV is complicated - You number candidates in order of preference, from most preferred to least preferred. You do not have to number all candidates. This is not complicated. If you can't understand this, you really shouldn't be voting *at all*.

* AV needs electronic voting machines and thus will be expensive. This was an outright lie. Their numbers included the cost of the referendum itself, and Australia, which has AV, doesn't have voting machines.

* AV counts your votes more than once - No, it counts your vote, once, for the party you like most, that is closer to winning. It allows your vote to exert influence even if you put your first priority for someone you actually really want to vote for, who isn't one of the main two and half parties. Under the current system, a vote for someone who isn't labour, conservative, or libdems (or greens in magnificent brighton) is pretty much totally wasted. Also, with safe seats and gerrymandering, and the non-national nature of overall count, your vote clearly translates to less influence for certain parties in certain places. Fun fact : The lib dems nationally got 63% of the votes that the conservatives got, but got 19% as many MPs elected. It took 35k votes to elect a conservative MP, but it takes almost 120k votes to elect a lib dem MP. And it took 919k votes to not elect a single UKIP MP. I don't like UKIP, but this situation is farcical in what we claim is a democracy. AV discourages tactical voting. It isn't as good at PR for national fairness. Basically, AV at least counts your vote, which FPTP doesn't if you don't vote for a main party.

* Very few other nations use AV, so it must be bad. A wholly fallacious [appeal to majority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum).


All of these arguments against AV are fallacious at best, and lies at worst. I consider the outcome of the referendum as a grave sign indeed for the current state of public discourse. David Cameron said, in public, that politics shouldn't be about what you think, it should be how you feel. And he got away with it, it seems, without the ridicule such sentiment clearly deserves. The 'No' result, to me, indicates the triumph of spin, misrepresentation, lies, and spurious argument, over reason. Which makes me a pretty sad panda, overall.

Anyway, can you lay down the reasons for keeping PR? I'm 24, by the way. I know I can be wrong, I will abandon my position if proved wrong.

After watching the race for my own university's union president, I am highly cynical of the whole affair. The candidates are either in it to cement their career in politics/management or to try and execute some kind of fantasy political ideology. 

As a result, the 10-20% turnout elects the most boring, safe person possible, and they spend a year overseeing the utterly pointless machinations of the union. These, as far as I can tell, usually include:

* some kind of 'access' outreach work - admirable but, quite frankly, this should be the responsibility of the university itself
* some kind of pointless 'green' policy that involves putting up posters. Nothing else happens once they realise that trying to convince the university - the only party with any money - to spend a pile of cash on solar panels or similar is a wasted cause
* 'welfare' or mental health support - again an admirable cause and something that is occasionally effective. But seriously, the university and the government need to take responsibility for this, not the union
* a women's campaign which, after protesting all of the reasonable issues, decides that it has to be seen to be doing something and starts campaigning about non-issues or completely idiotic things
* some completely arbitrary campaign about an access ramp or street lighting on campus - this might be the only thing they're good at, but are terrible at telling people what they're doing. Regardless, these normally affect a vanishingly small number of people.

I read the manifestos before the election and decided I couldn't care less. None of the candidates had any interesting ideas or vision.

With FFP the dead weight of players past their prime on salaries that were given to them when they were in top form is a real detriment and prevents us from bringing in players that could really improve the squad. 5 years ago he never would've been banished to the youth team, because it didn't matter if we posted losses. But it was clear that in this new era the board needed to make an example of him so that others wouldn't get it into their heads that they could burden the club financially. Personally I think that if he had left we would've brought in someone else in the holding midfield role, and this season could've gone very differently.

true,Raffles_Dad,null,null,"I was born in the early 70s but as an army brat I missed a lot of the problems that The UK faced at that time but this is what my parents have told me of why they loved being posted overseas. 

I was born in the Far East and we came back in 1972, we lived in the North West in a small flat. My father was an exceptional professional solder and my mother was a stay at home mum as with a 2 year old and 5 year old it was the cheapest option.  

They celebrated when my father was posted overseas as whilst they had been in the UK (less than 18 months) bread had tripled in price and the rubbish was building up in the street due to industrial action. Power cuts happened on a regular basis and basic services could not be depended on. 

We went from this to West Germany where everything just worked. 

We returned in the early 80s and we had to take a big step backwards in our standards of living and I was shocked with the rubbish on our streets as I never saw this growing up (even when living in third world countries) I also found the casual violence that is very much part of our culture very difficult to deal with. 

Within a year of being back milk was gone from the schools and we lost teachers at our school, whilst the local fee paying school has not stopped growing to this day.  

I consider that the UK had severe issues in the 70s and it required change, however I was brought up in a lot of countries and have travelled a lot in my adult life. We are a dysfunctional nation, rather than use evidence based practice to determine the best policy we end up following a belief system that has no basis in the real world. 

From whatever shade of the political spectrum you come from you should be open to the fact that you could be wrong and reverse policy.  This doesn‚Äôt happen as ‚Äúthe lady is not for turning‚Äù is still part of our ethos.

As for the Doctor being synonymous with ""warrior""- wasn't that the point of A Good Man Goes To War and the whole of Series 6?  That the Doctor was getting too ""loud"" and dangerous?  Personally I like the Doctor having a bit of dark streak and being something of an anti-hero at times, it makes the character more interesting (though as you said, if he did become a genocidal, war-mongering maniac I would be the first to voice my concerns)

&gt;
&gt;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
&gt;
&gt;But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
&gt;
&gt;This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.""

Bulk buying is better, but spending ¬£20 in one go may not always be possible, I could make up a whole host of scenarios where that is the case as other things need to be paid for ""in bulk"" at the start of the week too (rent?).

Hugo; Walker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, BAE/Rose; Sandro, Dembele, Holtby; Lennon,  Bale, Siggy.

Holtby has shown a willingness to tackle and track back, as well as his movement in the attacking third. Really excited for him to settle into the side.

As I've posted elsewhere on here, I see Siggy being converted to a true left-wing player; he provides great service, can shoot, and is generally settling in to that spot as the weeks go on, and it shows. Lennon is your cut-in right wing, making darting runs behind the defense.

If we don't convert Bale, Siggy can either play the top of the midfield 3 or come off the bench.

Other than our lack of a striker, we actually have players who would slot straight into AVB's 4-3-3. I think this season has been a measured entrance; we're playing an easier/ more natural formation to get used to his coaching/ concepts/ tactics, and we will start to transition to a 4-3-3 later on.

Yeah, all 3 years since she was 14.

I'm not convinced it's a generational issue at all. I'm only a few years older than her and am rather glad she has resigned. I don't particularly agree with the idea of youth commissioners in the first place, but that's another arguement.


I'm sure most of us have ""trolly"" or ""stupid"" comments in our post history. I know for a fact I do, not even that long ago. But then I don't work in PR for the bloody police.

She personally should have had the sense to check anything she could be called up on before she even applied for the position.

NUS just hasn't got any voice in parliament. Short of rioting, there is little it can really do to oppose government policy. It's the governments very own little bureaucratic construction which gives students the illusion that they have any power in politics. No one cares what the NUS says.


Apart for organising riots and marches, it has little impact - and you don't need a ¬£50k subscription fee from each student union for that either.

The concept of a national student voice isn't a bad one. It's just that this one is just implemented too poorly, has little leeway and costs too much! There needs to be a more streamlined body which can have actual impact, than just a card which gives you random discounts.

Some people have argued that the NUS abolished the council tax for students renting in homes - but I truly think that this would still have been accomplished with universities student unions liaising with their own local councilors to take up their cause.

The centre-left approach of the ANC government post-1994 was as a result of the deals made during the constitutional process and previously with important leaders during the Dakkar Conference.  It was a point reached due to compromise and negotiation. Mandela himself was a committed left winger and the ANC was predominantly a left-wing organisations. Slovo was not only a friend but a close colleague, Thambo was like a brother and they both led the ANC through its movement into power. 

If anything it was Mbeki , who was working in the background, who was responsible for some of the more centre left - IMF friendly policy making that the ANC introduced. Mandela was savvy enough to know that a united country is better than one divided by ideology. Something Mbeki was lambasted for by many in the ANC and one of the reasons Zuma was able to paint Mbeki as a traitor to the poor africans. 

Also his Pan-Africanism was an important left-wing ideology, it actually contributed to his stance on HIV and his failure to deal with rogues like Mugabe effectively. 

Mandela was a pragmatist because he knew that he had to make the country work together and thus was prepared to temper his own personal views to bring parties together - that is one his greatest achievements.

I don't actually see this attitude in day to day life. Most people I know or meet are hard working, or want the opportunity.

The attitude is directed at certain people because they don't have that willingness to learn, try their hardest and take whats thrown at them but overcome it.

Taking the route of crime is the easy way out for some people. When I said life is tough, I didn't mean ""just accept it."" The only way to overcome it is to do the exact opposite, but the problem is there are people that don't want to try.

What my point was supposed to be, that I didn't get across very well, was that if you have any shortcomings, be it intelligence or tough childhood, it is up to you to work out how to overcome it and work your hardest to do it. If your just gonna sit back and let someone else take a job because they are going to do it cheaper than you, and then just complain about it, then that's tough. 

Think long term, you have no money now and are probably on benefits. An immigrant is doing a job cheaper? Fuck that. Do that job for the same wage and do it better, you'll likely be paid more than benefits and will get a better job in the long run.

The index is to show comparison with the UK mean. What my original data suggested is that, compared to the UK as a whole, Yorkshire is becoming less productive while Scotland and the south east are becoming more productive. [Here's](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-accounts/regional-gross-value-added--income-approach-/december-2012/sum-interactive-maps.html) a map of the UK, showing regional GVA as pounds rather than as an index. [Here's](http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/regional%20breakdown%20who%20benefits/1041867.html) a better chart, showing regional variations in net government spending. What it shows is that, while Yorkshire receives more government money than it generates, it still falls far short of need. This pattern may well at least partly be the result of Thatcher's changes in the 1980s. Of course, social democrats have always held that government spending acts as an economic stimulus, so you could argue that addressing this imbalance would help other regions, including Yorkshire, become more productive.

However, this doesn't mean that a newly independent Yorkshire (or would it be called ""Northumberland"") would be subject to the same metrics; plus there is the bounce that comes from improved morale, revitalized workforce etc. (Alasdair Gray's ""Work as if you lived in the early days of a better nation""). Whether this could be sustained or not would depend on the Republic of Northumberland's ability to attract foreign investment, provide unique infrastructure or resource opportunities and so on. Also there is the issue of which government is paying for what part of the economy. When we play this game in the USA we always consider Federal government infrastructure and investment. There is one town in Alabama, for instance, with a military base that contributes 7% of the entire state's economic activity. If Alabama were to seek independence, that Federal money would disappear and Alabama would be in dire straits economically (not that it's doing great now). This is true for many states in the USA, especially southern and rural states.

true,SplurgyA,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; The problem with your entire post is it focuses solely on women and does not reflect the changes of how men are portrayed in advertisement media.

Men are often depicted as virile and powerful and rarely as sexually submissive objects. While the ideal male body might be difficult to achieve and is probably bad for male self esteem, you cannot really compare [sexualised men](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/31800000/David-Beckham-H-M-Underwear-Second-collection-2012-david-beckham-31845155-1354-1754.jpg) with how [women are sexualised](http://media-cache-ec4.pinterest.com/550x/c8/cd/7f/c8cd7fcb68e6f482f57752e378bf405b.jpg). For comparison check out these uncomfortable pictures of [men as pinups](http://www.flickr.com/photos/clickandclash/sets/72157626584908000/) to see what it looks like when men are rendered as submissive objects.

In terms of it not being as ""common"" as it was, it is true you are unlikely to see a woman seeing herself as a failure because she cannot [please her husband with coffee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnjjkgIO3Ck) or being told [she cannot drive](http://testdb.msmagazine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sexist_vw_bug_ad_for_husbands.jpg), our more sexualised society is instead going for [implied oral sex](http://www.popcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/burger-king-oral-sex-ad.jpg) or [gang rape](http://egyptsaidso.com/files/2009/03/dolce-and-gabbana-rape-ad.jpg). You can argue there is [sexism against men in advertising](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S62sl-qWEqo) but for the most part men are depicted as bumbling and incompetent at things like housework, cooking or gardening and need their wife/girlfriend to do it - i.e. men cannot do *woman's work*. This is subtly reinforcing gender roles and is arguably still bad for women while making men look bad too.

You know, I think SRS goes too far sometimes but I have a lot of sympathy for some of their stances. We are discussing how *young girls* might be negatively effected by how *naked women* are in a *national newspaper* and you have popped up to say ""What about men?"". For what it is worth I am a bloke and I think it is sometimes impossible to have a discussion about feminism on reddit without having someone try and make the conversation about the ""male perspective"". We are men.

true,Ryantcairns,,Newcastle,"I'd argue that the real issue is that we DON'T exactly have partisanship in NI. I would love to see a robust, mature political system where people vote based on real policy and economics. I'd love to see people vote across left right lines, rather than across the border. 

I too am sick of this constant wallowing in past traumas. It should be remembered, respected and noted of course, but we need to be willing to move past it, and take the conflict out of politics. It does no good, and only increases our legislative deficit. So I totally agree with you there, we need to be about moving forward, finding smarter solutions and being committed to developing Northern Ireland. 

As for the current crop of MLAs, I think it is unfortunate that many of the old guard remain steadfast in their bitterness and unwavering in their bigotry. We need politicians who can separate history and their religious beliefs from the decisions they make. I'd love to see 'sexuality' added to the list of things we cannot discriminate because of. 

I am personally an Atheist. I have no problem at all with anyone's personal faith or religion, I just think it is unfortunate that organised religion often crosses the line and ends up restricting human rights for no conceivable or justifiable reason. I think as long as people do not act upon religious beliefs in a way that infringes on anyone else Human Rights, then their beliefs should be respected and protected. For the record I do believe in evolution. 

As for what I'd actually like to do, I have mentioned a few of my aims and things in the other questions, so rather than commit to specifics I will spell out a few of my themes:

I'd like equality for everyone, for NI to join other countries in supporting Gay Rights and eliminating discrimination where possible. I'd like to see more support for startups and SMEs, in order to help bring a sense of entrepreneurship back to NI, and stop the 'brain drain'. I'd like to really bring Mental Health issues to the forefront, and help people to realise they are serious problems and we need to eliminate the social stigma around them. I'd like to tackle youth unemployment through volunteer schemes, apprenticeships and alternate paths to further education. This may include introducing incentives for employers to hire more young people on temporary contracts etc.

The older staff, who've already done their stint overseas, and are 30 to 40 years of age are left to pick up all the slack, which means overworked staff and unpaid overtime, and a general malaise and discontentment within the hospital - however, because of the absolutely shitty minimum wage, and even shittier employers who pay a couple of quid more just to differentiate skill levels, you end up with the situation my wife is in.

If the janitor gets minimum wage (7 quid a day), a newly graduated nurse will get 7 1/2 quid a day, and a senior staff nurse with 20 years experience will get 8 quid a day.

Allen:  You cannot be a deep lying midfielder who can get muscled off the ball.   He's a mid table midfielder at best.

Sturridge :  Same thing.  Sturridge can score.  Unfortunately he makes tons of bad decisions while he's not scoring.  Sure Liverpool need someone to put it in the back of the net, but to be top 4 your players need to be more than one dimensional.   Good mid table player.

Borini:  I seriously have no clue where people think he is good.  Work rate?  I have a great work rate in football.   I just don't see his skill/decisionmaking on par with the top teams players.

Shelvey just won't cut it.  He's a slightly better Sterling ( with regards to their positions).  Jonjo has an older Gerrard style to him, which isn't great for the direction modern football is going =/

Coutinho we agree on.  He has the potential to be calibur and help us get maintain top 4 quality.  His defensive work rate needs improving though, but im not to concerned with that, he seems very aggresive in learning on the pitch.  His D has already improved from the few games i have seen.


I hope you know, im splitting hairs.  These are quality footballers, but i'm judging based on 1. the money we pay these guys ( top 4 money to most ) and 2.  The quality of the game right now in the top teams ( ie turnovers being the second most important stat next to goals ). 

I think we could have already been top 4 with better decision making as a club.

Where did I say that? We had topped the group by the time we got 12 points.

&gt; then the games mattered again when you played real and drew, and then the games didn't matter again when you lost because its a cup and luck.

Where did I say that? They mattered, I wanted to go through, I just have a life mate and there's no point in getting upset about stuff you can't control.

12 points is a lot of luck, anyone who knows what they're talking about will tell you the best team wins the league every season, you were better than us last year and deserved it, we're better than you this year.

 By closely examining a screen-cap of the episode, all evidence leads to Akhaten being a planet. 

Using the two lines of dialogue and the image of the celestial body, it is clearly a planet. The Doctor refers to the light from an Alien Sun, which in the image you can see a ""white"" light bouncing off the upper shell of the planet. This piece of dialogue could be referring to either the light or the planet, so it is inconclusive. 

The second line is when he mentions life originated on that planet. The Doctor is referring to any of the 3 major bodies in front of him, but two clearly look like asteroids, and saying life originated on a satellite of a planet could be interpreted as life originating on the planet, as it is normally regarded as one thing (a planet and all its moons). 

And the evidence that tipped me over the edge, looking at the image of the planet, it not only has an atmosphere, but more closely resembles a gas giant rather than a burning star. 

It is indeed a planet, but calling it a sun isn't 100% wrong, in general it is pretty ambiguous, and could swing to a sun and have plenty of evidence to back it up. It isn't something worth worrying about.

Few people can achieve rising income through social skills, social connections, hard work and education. Most will never get far enough ahead.

true,Gorshiea,null,null,"You are thinking of communism. Socialism is merely a method of owning and distributing resources; it is not a form of government. Socialism can be actuated at the government level, local government level, within private ownership or by non-governmental community organizations. It has nothing to do with force. Companies that are set up to be collectives or cooperatives are excellent examples of private socialism. They tend to distribute money and ownership more equitably and have a more democratic, consensus-based decision making process. They may be part of the ""free market"" but they are not capitalist in structure. Capitalism is a different method of owning and distributing goods and services. It tends to concentrate money and ownership upwards, resulting in an authoritarian and hierarchical power structure.

EDIT: Yes, I did say ""free market"". There is such a thing as free market socialism. The free market is not synonymous capitalism. The opposite of the free market would be a planned economy, and this could be organized as socialism or corporatism. The USA thinks it has a free market, but in terms of dollars, typically operates more as a planned corporatist economy in which huge government subsidies and tax breaks encourage certain types of economic activity and discourage others, with few of the benefits going to individual workers.

true,SplurgyA,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"It *does* do both sexes a disservice, but it does women a much greater disservice. Women are frequently victimised by society because, well, ""this is a mans world"".

&gt; it forces men into ultra-masochism, one where he must be strong, smart, virile and good looking.

Men would feel bad being exposed to those images and if you reread my post I mention that. Women also feel masochistic when they do not live up to their beauty ideals. 

But there are more insidious things at play here rather than just esteem issues over appearance. The issue here is not that a girl might see the naked lady and go ""I am not as pretty as her"", but more ""I need to behave like her"". Women may feel disempowered, like their self worth is balanced exclusively on personal appearance, that they need to focus on marketing themselves to men. Men, on the flip side, might start feeling entitled to sex, that women exist as sexual objects... 

Put it this way. Recently there has been a spate of John Hamm penis bulge pictures making the rounds on the internet. Apparently he is packing meat. This is what he had to say about it:

&gt;""They're called 'privates' for a reason. ""I'm wearing pants, for fuck's sake. Lay off.""

So this is objectification of a man. This is unusual. The newspapers made a big deal of the fact that a man has a tumblr about his penis. Compare this to all the internet resources there are out there about actresses, or how this interviewer had no qualms asking [Anne Hathaway about her underwear](http://youtu.be/yruIL5lVGE4?t=1m9s).

In terms of advertising, men are *rarely* shown as stupid or incompetent or scary. Compare it to the amount of times a woman is shown as just a hot body to ""have sex at"" and you will see quite the disparity. Men with wrinkles and grey hair are not unusual in the media but if you look at women more often than not they are picked because they are young and pretty and [when they get older they may well get bumped for a younger model](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9192152/BBC-faces-fresh-claims-of-sexism-and-ageism.html). This all feeds back in to a culture where women are aesthetic objects.

So of course I find it annoying if an add tars all men with the same brush but we have it so, so much better than women. This is why I was annoyed at you - because you took the issue of women being objectified and the wider societal issues they face and tried to make it into a discussion about ""men feel bad around sexy adverts too"". Yes, we do and it does negatively impact us and that is an important issue, but it is somewhat irrelevant to this discussion. Also it is worth pointing out on that front that an ugly man gets away with it a lot more than an ugly woman, a chubby bloke is more acceptable than a ""fat cow"", men do not have to put on makeup in the mornings (and risk getting judged if they do not), you do not have to worry if your clothes are making you look too ""slutty""...

Left-back, striker, wingers
Excess:
attacking midfielders, center midfielders

Center midfielders we have Parker, Sandro, Dembele, Huddlestone, Carroll, Livermore, and Holtby has played there too. We don't need six at the same position when only two get on the field. Huddlestone is a dead end, Holtby was a cheap buy (just too unathletic). I would like to see Carroll get more minutes here.

As much as I like Eriksen and as good I think he is and as much as he wants to come here, I think we're overloaded at his position.

Instead of forcing out middle midfielders to play wide, we should sell some of the middle midfielders and buy some wingers. Mohammad Salah (Basel, had a good game against us and is only 20), Viktor Fischer (Ajax, don't know how expensive, but huge upside), among others.

I don't want to see Vertonghen stuck at left back next season. I also don't want to see Assou-Ekotto play poorly and Naughton stuck using only his right foot. If AVB doesn't think BAE can cut it, then go buy. Noe one comes to kind unfortunately.

true,cacafogo,num5,,"&gt;He can cross and make fantastic runs and

Yes he can cross well, but we haven't exactly had someone to get on the end of those crosses.

&gt;He can cut inside and get a shot off, like he has been doing all season.

Cutting inside from the left is not a good way to take advantage of his left foot.  He either shoots with a weaker right (which he has scored some great goals with, but you would be foolish to want him using it all the time) or has to make a second cut to get back onto his left; neither situation is ideal.

&gt;When he does drop inside, other players are already pre-occupied with marking the other midfielders/strikers and it gives him enough space and time on the ball to create something magical. 

If someone else is already in the middle, Bale going inside does nothing but take away space.  It gets far too congested in the middle unless someone moves out to a wider position.  If no one moves out, we also lose an outlet to that side.

Bale has the stamina to play all over the pitch.  He is also our most dangerous weapon, and it would not be wise to confine him to the left side.  When he is in the middle he drifts around, finding all kinds of space (including the left side).  His drifting and the swapping positions of the other mids helps to confuse the opposing defense, or at least pull them out of position occasionally.  From the middle he can make use of his fantastic left foot at almost any moment.  He still uses his speed and dribbling ability to beat players.  Putting him on the left is essentially asking him to focus on crossing instead of shooting, and given our current personnel and his skill that is not the best use of his abilities.  He would get less time on the ball, again not ideal, and it would be easier for him to get marked out of the game.  Any way you slice it, he has to come inside.  When he comes inside someone has to go out.  They might as well just skip the lead up and start there.

true,heggory,logo,,"Again, I said we're the better side in Manchester not the country. We wouldn't be 12 behind if we were the best in the country. Fair enough, Milner's goal was from a deflection but was at least on target, Jones header wasn't even heading towards goal. Take both goals away and we still won regardless from Aguero's goal. 

Yes we were seeded pot 2 and unfortunately we got Dortmund from pot 4. I'm not gonna make excuses for the teams performances, since we should have at least beat Ajax, but we played well against Madrid, but let our lead slip, and Dortmund was always going to be a tough opponent. We knew it was going to be a difficult group, its disappointing to have not gotten a win, but that's how it goes. We know we'll be back in the CL next year so we'll improve then. It's our second appearance in the CL in a long time and we didn't perform up to our potential.

And again, at no point did I say we deserved the title over you, I said you were lucky to pick up points in your last two games. It's obvious that we weren't better overall this season, we dropped crucial away points because our strikers weren't finishing. Too many draws, while United was finding ways back from being down or being tied and taking vital 3 points. I'm not denying City gets their fair share of luck too, just pointing out that luck isn't irrelevant in league play.

You support your team, I'll support mine. You were clearly the better side in the league this time around, but we'll take pride that we were able to take points from you at Old Trafford. You took points from us at the Etihad. We both played in the CL and both went out. You played well through qualifying and got through to be perhaps unjustly beaten due to a red card. We didn't play great and got eliminated early. We're a strong team though and we'll bounce back.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"There are lots of arguments made against Moffat. I'll try and be quick about listing a couple.

*Moffat's women are all the same flirty, witty young companions.* Actually this one isn't a crime. And in my opinion, it isn't true. Clara and Amy seem like very different people to me. Amy was more selfish and sassy. Clara is good with children and Amy never wanted any. edit: I mean that's just a couple concrete things, but you can't boil people down to their most blatant characteristics and call them the same.

*Moffat's women are all damsels in distress.* Except for River, Vastra, Jenny, Madge...

*Moffat's women do not have agency.* People cite the fact that Amy sort of gets kidnapped or hauled around (to Rory's bachelor party) places without her consent. Except that it's a stick problem. Because companions don't really have any agency when they travel with the Doctor because the Doctor is the one with the time machine. There will always be an imbalanced power dynamic. Though Amy does get handed around a lot. In contrast, Clara and River both have agency. Clara the governess violates Victorian values to run two jobs on the sly. Modern!Clara has friends and babysits a family on her own time. We know River can break out of prison and have adventures all the time. It's a bit more iffy with River because her life was literally designed to revolve around the Doctor. (Also note: there is a difference between ""strong"" female characters and ones with agency.)

*Moffat's women are not relatable ""real"" characters and the show is told from a male point of view (male gaze)*. This one is a little more true. Except for the second part. Moffat's characters are harder to relate to because he doesn't write characters as well as RTD. If season 6 was supposed to be about Amy's pregnancy/River Song's identity, why did we never see scenes where Amy or River have a sort of heart to heart scene where they talk about how they feel? i.e. ""This is so unreal. I don't know how to process this."" etc. etc. 

So yeah his females aren't as fleshed out as some would like them to be (though I know many are happy with them). But the males aren't any more relatable either. The Doctor is a 1200 year old alien, we can't relate to him (hence the companion). And Rory was no more or less lacking in personality than Amy. In my personal opinion I think they're both relatable and nice characters with personalities, even if they're not as fleshed out as RTD's.

*Another accusation is that Steven Moffat's characters are all mothers or love interests for the Doctor/other male.* Except for Vastra and Jenny. Or Madame Kovarian.

*A side accusation is also that he is heteronormative/portrays LGBTQ characters poorly.* While Moffat's LGBTQ characters do not just go about their day and happen to be gay (etc.) like Captain Jack, Moffat is definitely a supporter of LGBTQ representation. Vastra, Jenny, the Anglican marines, River Song (according to his tweets). This also helps erase the other accusation that Moffat is too heteronormative. Heteronormativity tends to ignore/erase homosexuality rather than be negative towards it (homophobia) yet again, Vastra and Jenny.

Moffat actually likes to shove LGBTQ rights in your face. In a way, it's like he has more of a gay agenda than anyone ever accused RTD of having. His characters, Vastra and Jenny, are snarky. ""I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife."" or ""We're the thin-fat-gay-Anglican Marines, do we need names?"" (which points out the minority factor).

edit: Moffat even states himself in an interview that he never listens to peoples' criticisms except for the one time when someone said he had no LGBTQ characters in series 5. He wanted to fix that immediately, and did so in series 6.

This is a short list and may not be my best expressed post ever but I hope it gives people an idea.

**EDIT: Actual instances of sexism and/or sexist *connotations* under Moffat...**

Would be the fact that many more of his episodes than RTD's have failed the Bechdel Test (please Google), though he's doing fine so far in series 7b.

Would be the fact that he wrote a character like Abigail with no agency or independence or personality. An old Victorian trope of purity. A woman who is used as collateral for money- literally property. Who is taken out of a box to play with every year.... I love *A Christmas Carol*, but we should keep this in mind.

Would be the fact that the Doctor has been stalking Clara/her parents. Even worse, he didn't tell Clara. He also hasn't told her the truth about her multiple selves. He also never told Amy about her pregnancy, *or* her being a ganger. The Doctor keeps secrets from his female companions about things that explicitly have to do with them/their bodies. He has also officially met 4 of his companions as children and then snogged then when they were older. I don't know if Steven Moffat realizes how creepy this comes off but maybe it should be addressed at some point.

Now, to hook you:

It'd seem to make sense to start with NewWho season 1 (Doc #9, Eccleston), and it is a good spot to start. A personal favorite from that is simply titled ""Dalek"", and clues you in to a lot of the basic mythology of the show. After that, the two-parter ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" is excellent for showing you the kind of new things being done with the series. Also, it gets bonus points for Captain Jack.

After those 3, you should be set to see from Eccleston's Season 1 through the current season in order.

I'd give more good ones from other seasons, but I don't want to get hopes up or spoil anything. Just know that ""Blink"" is a traditional initiation episode, and the recent ""Rings of Ankhaten"" is one I plan to use to initiate some friends.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Mmmmk this is going to be a long post, and it might be a bit disjointed as I'm at work and trying to write this without being noticed.  It's also a lot of things built up that I've had on my mind for a while now so it isn't completely a direct reply to your posts, but it does speak to your points a bit.  I think you've hit on a lot of the things that have been bothering me, but some of them I can't help but disagree with.

Our defense has issues that need to be sorted.  I don't think the entire fault on this lies with the coaching.  Skrtel in particular was incredible last season, but only ok to good for the time before that.  We've had times where we look obviously lost at the back for sure, and that is a coaching/tactical/organizational issue.  But we've also had instances where we simply seemed to lack quality.  Individual errors from players have to belong to the players at some point.  I think a new defender or two this summer coupled with a different approach to coaching the defence will fix this.  Now, as for players that BR has brought in or promoted from the youth teams:

I don't think Borini (22 years old) is sub par.  He enjoyed success in Italy (a league praised for it's tough, pragmatic defending) at the young age of 20.  I'm not sure if you got to watch him play while he was at Roma, but he was really good.  He's very clever about finding space and links up well with the players around him.  His time here has been hampered by serious injuries and he's not had a chance to settle.  Most new players coming from other leagues, and especially young ones, need time to adapt to the different culture of the country they're in as well as their new opposition.  The game is different in England than it is in Italy.  He spent time at Chelsea and Swansea during his development, but the youth squads don't really prepare you for what the EPL offers per say.

Allen (22 years old) was great early on in the season, really good for team GB this past summer, and awesome for Swansea last season.  But he had also played as many games by December as he had in the entirety of the previous season (and without a summer break at that!), and was carrying that shoulder injury.  He has an obvious bit of quality about him and he will fit in.  You can't particularly fault him for being uncomfortable playing roles he isn't used to while obviously being overused/exhausted and also injured.

I'm frustrated by Shelvey (20 years old).  Maybe some day he'll be good enough, but he isn't yet.  I think he needs to spend a season on loan with a mid table side where he can play every weekend.

Sterling (18 this season... was starting games as a 17 year old) is a kid.  He's incredibly talented for his age and made a great impact, but to expect him to sustain that form over the long term at his age is unfair at best.

Suso (19 years old) is similar to Shelvey for me.  I don't think we can give him the game time he needs to really become comfortable with the power of the EPL.  A loan would be awesome for him.

Coutinho (20 years old) has had a hell of an impact since coming in.  His talent and potential are obvious and once he's really settled in we're going to see big things from him.  He's going to struggle with the physicality of the league just like Suso though as they're of similar physical stature (small).

Sturridge (23 years old) has been a beast. He'll do big things for us.  He knows how to find the back of the net, but he's got great technical ability and has linked up with Suarez well so far.

I listed all of their ages for a reason (and I'm sorry if I'm off by a year on some of them, I don't know all of their birthdays! haha): They're barely more than teenagers.  They're still years away from their peak.  Maybe Rodgers seems underwhelming because we're not in the top 4, but the results he's finding with an extremely young side are great.  The squad is being built for the next few years, not for a huge bang right now that will quickly fall off.  It seems obvious with the way FSG wants transfers to go and the appointment of BR that they're looking at working into a long term plan.  Obviously we want results now too, and we should do.  You're not the only one who is disappointed at the way we've crashed out of the cups and watched 4th place (though it was a lofty expectation from the beginning IMO, I still wanted it) slip away.  We need to be patient now though.  The toxic aura that plagued the club for the past few years seems to be lifted and our new energy will carry us forward.

We had serious issues with squad depth for the first half of the season, as evidenced by our reliance on teenagers (I think we were starting 4 at the same time at one point?) and needing to play so many players out of position to cope.  Since that's been buttoned up and we were able to bring in Coutinho/Sturridge, two players who really filled missing links for us, we've been awesome.  If the league started on boxing day we'd be sitting in second place having scored more goals than everyone else in the league.  Contrast that to the first half of the season and I'd say the progress that BR has made is pretty obvious. Also look at the way players like Henderson and Downing have come back into form.  That's at least partly due to BR (and our outstanding sports psychologist I'm sure).",0,1365539630,null,0,false,0,c9btjf8,t3_1bzi9x,t1_c9btjf8,t1_c9bq8es,null,1431616083,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

&gt;Tips on safety?

Avoid certain inner city area's if you're worried about safety.  Speak to locals of those city's to find out where to avoid, but in gereral we dont have any total no go area's.  Other than that, the rest of the country is *very* safe compared to South Africa.

&gt;Cheap transport and accommodation would be greatly appreciated.

We have a very extensive train network in the UK that can take you pretty much anywhere.

http://www.projectmapping.co.uk/Reviews/Resources/UK%20map.jpeg

As for cheap places to stay, have a look at http://www.travelodge.co.uk/ which is a national chain of cheap hotels that do rooms for two as cheap as ¬£20 a night in places.  They're also located pretty much EVERYWHERE in the country

&gt;Now, for the questions, how easy and cheap is it to get across these lines?

What do you mean by lines?

&gt;How safe is it to travel on public transport?

Very safe.

&gt;Do we watch out for pick pockets or terrorists?

Pick pockets are only a problem around Londons tourist hotspots and are unheard of anywhere else.  As for terrorists, you're more likely to be killed by being struck by lightning.

&gt;What sites outside the usual ""holiday destinations"" should we check out?

http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/ is a great resource for places to visit around the UK.  Other than that, i'd HIGHLY recomend sticking [Cornwall in South East England](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boNT46BMyWg) on your list of places to visit, although its more of a summer destination.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Imo the body thing is not sexist so much as sexist connotations. The difference is that if it happened to a man, the Doctor would simply be a creepy, manipulative and secretive person. The problem is that there is an institution in our society that is designed to control and police women's bodies. In this way do the Doctor's actions have bad connotations. If there was an institution policing men's bodies there would be the same issue.

The Doctor ""getting the girl but not wanting the girl and hanging out with the girls"" is not something that's been ""part of"" the show since the beginning. The first TARDIS crew was a middle aged man, woman, and the Doctor's granddaughter Susan. The Doctor never had romantic relations with any of his companions during the classic series. He was in fact portrayed as asexual, though there was tension in one episode between himself and Jo Grant.

Also, I find the ""get the girl, X the girl, etc."" type of phrasing to be uncomfortable. I don't think Doctor Who operates under this formula and I don't like things that generally do. Donna Noble was a companion of the Doctor's who he didn't ""get"" (as if women were prizes or something). Nor did he ""get"" Amy.

The Bechdel Test is a basis for revealing the lack of agency and independence women have from men in their lives. It's a way of showing how women are still considered beings who are supposed to satellite men. This type of thought is definitely related to issues of sexism (and the patriarchy).

That being said, the ¬£50,000 figures does seem quite absurdly high, considering child benefit amounts to ¬£20.30 a week (approx. ¬£1055 per annum) for the first child and ¬£13.40 per week (approx ¬£696 per annum) for subsequent children; especially given the costs of food and such, I can't imagine the additional children being worth the costs unless the money wasn't spent on their upkeep.

Regarding Tax Credits, I'm not sure how many disabled children, children under 1 etc. the Philpotts had, but if they were earning over ¬£6,420 per annum (approx. ¬£123 per week), their benefits would suffer a withdrawal rate of 41% until they were under that limit. 

If the Philpotts were working on a very low wage, they could increase that by Working Tax Credit to a maximum cap of ¬£15,860 per annum (approx. ¬£304 per week) with the same withdrawal rate if over the limit, but even then, this funding only applied to the **main carer** of the family, and can't (or shouldn't) be applicable to multiple people.

With Job Seekers Allowance, a person can earn up to ¬£3692 per annum (¬£71 per week), but dependant on the type (albeit, applicable to all types), they tend to be quite stringent regarding not having income above a certain level already etc.

Hard transfers like SWIFT typically can't be reversed... unless fraud is involved then they can claw the money back and debit your receiving bank account in the negative. Again this is why they wait 3 days or so for transfer to clear. 

There is also a lot of bitcoin MITM attacks happening. This is is how it works:

I sell fake car, boat, computer, mining rig anything on ebay or other site. I convince the buyer to send me a bank wire and since the buyer thinks they are sending directly to seller's bank account, they are safe and can contact bank later if there's a problem. Me (scammer) goes to you and puts in a buy order for 100 bitcoins. You send me SWIFT details for the wire.

I tell the buyer to send the SWIFT to you pretending you are me. Buyer sends money, I get untraceable bitcoins and run off never to be seen again. A few days later you get a phone call from your bank or the police asking you where the money went for the transfer you received. You try to explain you sent the bitcoins but the bank doesn't care and reverses the transaction if the guy cries fraud enough. The guy won't believe you aren't part of the scam and will sick cops + lawyers on the bank. They will force you to refund unless you can afford lawyers.

They do this for cash deposits too (MITM attack) so you need to have the guy sending the bank transfer put something in the comments to make this a less likely scam.

But it's an interesting topic, if you disregard the idiotic metaphor with Cromwell:

&gt;Sir Charles Powell, then her private secretary, told the programme that she also called for Northern Ireland's border with the republic to be redrawn.

&gt;""She thought that if we had a straight line border, not one with all those kinks and wiggles in it, it would be easier to defend,"" he said.

&gt;The zigzag border is notoriously difficult to patrol. But Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, then cabinet secretary, told Lady Thatcher of the folly of her idea.

&gt;""It wasn't as simple as that because the nationalist communities were not all in one place, not all in Fermanagh and Tyrone and South Armagh and so on,"" he told the programme.

&gt;""There were many in Belfast, and the idea of partition in Belfast or moving large numbers of population didn't seem to be very attractive.""

&gt;However, she would not abandon her idea and called for a ""security zone"" on both sides of the border to help the British army and the RUC to chase IRA terrorists who used to slip over the border after attacks in the north. This was rejected out of hand by the Irish government.

It all indicates typically Thatcherite and robust methods of dealing with a problem that was destroying lives on a daily basis, including people close to her. Any hypothetical 'organised' displacement would have been in effect a larger version of the massive migration by religion that happened anyway at the onset of the Troubles, so if people are so outraged at a Cromwell mkII that didn't happen, why aren't people so vexed about the Cromwell mkII that did?

BR has employed a 2-man midfield only a handful of times, over the 47 games we've played total.  He hasn't been playing with only 2 mids ""over and over.""  In fact, WhoScored doesn't show us playing a 2-man midfield at all, but I think you meant having only one true defensive-minded holding mid, which has only happened a few times.

Secondly, I don't think Agger has not been performing.  I think Agger's run of fitness and form is one of BR's biggest achievements.  Dani seems back to his old self.  Skrtel has had some problems, but rarely in the form of a terrible game, as a whole (discounting Oldham).  The issue is our individual mistakes.  We have 17 clean sheets in all comps, which is a rate of 36%, including 12 in the EPL (second only to City).  Only 4 teams have less goals conceded than us in the EPL this year and Spurs have the same.

The system Rodgers uses is based on defense via possession, skill, and pressing rather than tough tackling, making great saves, and heroic blocks.  That system is fine, but BR will not concede possession, so it becomes pretty irrelevant.  Rafa, for instance, was an excellent defensive manager, but we were mainly, I'd say, a counter attacking side under him.  Sadly, the way for us to improve our defense is not really through tactics, it's through skill.  For some players, it'll never come (Coates, Spearing, perhaps Skrtel).

We can't let the few, albeit big, mistakes BR has made (in his first year, for god's sake), cloud the outlook over the entire season.",0,1365543227,null,0,false,0,c9buzta,t3_1bzi9x,t1_c9buzta,t1_c9bpehj,null,1431615397,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I think you are probably right about those players listed as not all having the talent to become top players, but almost all sides are not filled with only top talent.  Someone like Allen, for instance, is very similar to a Carrick for United or an Arteta for Arsenal--a player who is highly rated where they are but not considered one of the best in the world.  That's okay.  In a top *side* you often have players who are there to do a job or two to cover for the top talent.  Lucas is a great example, as he's considered a top player, but probably only because his position (CDM) is often judged on fewer responsibilities (but ones that are very important).  People like Shelvey or Borini are asked to do a number of huge jobs (score, create, press, and track back) and because of that they don't look convincing, especially at this point.  But they should not be judged just on their all-around individual skill, but their skill and fit within the side.

Overall, though, my point is that there are places for players who are excellent at two or three things at a top side, just as there is a necessity for players who can do it all in their part of the pitch.  Stevie can literally do everything (the man made a save with his head that Reina couldn't at all :) ), as can Suarez and Coutinho do all things related to their role in attack (maybe Coutinho has some issues with tracking back, but most everything else he does very well).  So you build your squad around the complete players and fill out the team by covering the weaknesses of those players with others.  Henderson is a great example of someone who is very skilled but is employed, for me, mainly to replace the legs and work rate Gerrard used to offer.  Jordan gets closer to the box and offers the passing and shooting Stevie can (well, close) and he tracks back and gives the defensive support that SG did before he got a bit older (and still does, just more selectively).

By two man midfield I mean two central midfielders. It has certainly happened on a few occasions. Whenever we've played with two strikers and every time has been disastrous.

I have tons of faith in Rodgers but defending his every move is just idiocy when he hasn't proven he's flawless.

Hendo has gotten a bad wrap IMO.  Suso hasn't played as much as he should.  Allen has started about half the season, and we can agree it has been controversial at times.  Borini, I don't even think he should be on the bench ( mega critical here just from what i've seen of him - only about 10 games ).

The coaches role is to sub and start the correct people.  I think Rogers has had a great philosophy and stuff, but it's lackluster when he chooses a side.  He likes to play people out of position expecting them to be just as good as they are in a normal spot ( think Hendo or Sturridge or Suso at a wing position ).

I honestly don't even know what were talking about anymore.  Your posts have been so long, that i forget what it's about at the end.  Then i spend time making a giant retort which i have to reread because i don't even know what im talking about anymore.

true,TJP343,null,null,"The first thing to keep in mind is that most teams play in two different shapes, one defensive shape and then a build-up/attacking shape. The 4-3-3 doesn't see as dramatic a shift in tactical duties as say defending in a 4-4-2 and building up in a 4-2-3-1. That transition involves one of the '2' to drop in behind the other '2' and the two wide players in the front bank of four to push forward and leave behind the two center mids.

If your defending in a 4-3-3, that is the CF pressing the opposition centerbacks/goalkeeper, the wingers marking their opposite fullback out of the game, the back four keeping a high line and the midfield three working hard to win back possession when you regain possession the front three are more or less where you want them, in advanced positions, the centerbacks only need to spread out wide and allow the fullbacks to push on and one mid remains behind to pickup the ball from deep and protect against a counter attack. At that point, it's not really a 4-3-3, it's more of a 3(two centerbacks, deep mid)-4(two advanced mids, fullbacks pushing forward into midfield)-3(wingers getting wide, and the CF either acting as a target man or dropping into midfield as a false nine to form a diamond).

That brings us to the question of whether or not Tottenham could operate with the players on hand in such a formation. I believe they can with one major concern, Bale. He is Spurs best player, yes, but this drifting inside from a wide left position is not new this season. He did it last year as well and I believe AVB has recognized this and decided to just field him in the middle from the start and stick someone else out wide on the left. If Bale is going to always be playing in midfield from now on, the only way he works in a 4-3-3 is as the center forward.

Or Bale could move out to the right and cut inside. But he can't ""cut inside"" without beginning the build-up in a constant wide position. He no longer seems willing to do this, so he's not going to work on either wing. Once the Bale dilemma is solved, everything else falls into place pretty well looking ahead to next season. Let's say they make Bale the CF, then Lennon/Townsend/Rose have the ability to play as wingers given their pace, work rate and dribbling being as good as they are.

Lennon has shown a willingness to work hard defending, Rose is playing now as a LB but has the ability to play as a LM/LW and Townsend seems like a good wide player as well. You can see them filling the defensive duty of marking the fullback out of the game and dropping back when needed to help defend while being able to quickly motor forward and link up with Bale in stretching the opponent's backline very quickly.

A midfield trio has to have the Barcelona three, a creative attacking mid(Iniesta), a solid and yet very mobile deep mid(Busquetts)(shield, destroyer, inverted sweeper, whatever you want to call it) and a, well, a Xavi, both an excellent short and long range passer who can make forward runs smartly. Spurs could put out a less talented three that fill those roles, Siggy as our Iniesta, Sandro as our Busquetts and, we don't have a Xavi type do we? Maybe Carroll/Huddlestone but they would most likely have to make do with Dembele working hard to both support Sandro defensively and get forward ahead of Siggy to support the build-up/attack phase. It could work.

The backline already has shown they can play in a 4-3-3. They play the high line very well(Spurs lead the EPL in catching opponents offside) and Walker will push forward and Vertonghen will burst into midfield in possession when needed, Dawson can play deep passes fairly well and both our first choice centerbacks have defended outstandingly well this season even when being caught out in the high line and not possessing great pace.

There might be a need for a LB to replicate Walker's approach on the right and that player is Danny Rose. Field Townsend ahead of him at LW and put Rose at LB, move Bale into a CF role and it could work. We've seen all these players fill the role they would be asked to fill at some point this season. 

Moving from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3 basically flip flops the center three, instead of a double pivot and one advanced mid, you leave behind one mid and push two forward. Sandro is capable of shielding the back four by himself and giving his two midfield buddies the license to roam forward, especially knowing if Spurs are caught out on a counter, Walker and Rose get back very quickly to help slow down and stop counters and begin again.

Spurs have shown flashes of a 4-3-3 defensive setup but too often we've seen the wide mids drop back into a second bank of four. If they do that with a single holder and two advanced mids Spurs would wind up defending in a 4-1-4-1. It really comes down to finding the right deep mid(which is Sandro) and two or three wingers who will ALWAYS keep their width and work hard to mark out the other team's fullbacks and drop back when needed to help defend.

Spurs are not far off and could play in this way, but it would have to be with Bale as the center forward.  ",0,1365545696,null,0,false,0,c9bvxuw,t3_1byqeq,t1_c9bvxuw,t3_1byqeq,null,1431614951,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Well it would appear that perhaps scoring is just up as a trend this season in the EPL given that we have conceded the 5th least goals in the league, no?  Certainly the table would show that there is a huge amount more parity between 4-18, where only 27 points separates the 4th and 18th spots (lowest since 04-05, and a gap that is usually hovering around 40 points).

I certainly won't say BR has been good on the defensive side (and notice I didn't in my initial post), but there doesn't yet seem to be a systemic problem, it is simply our technical weakness and relative lack of familiarity with the system that seems to be the issue.  If there were a larger problem we wouldn't be performing as well, relatively, defensively.  I see that comparison made to last year, but I don't know that that is important given that our system was different and we've scored far more goals, which highlights our much greater emphasis on attacking, and thus our shift in defensive philosophy.  For me, if we are performing in the top 25% of the league (and even better for clean sheets) there is not a crisis.

I will say that there could be a literal systemic problem if BR keeps our current defenders and insists on playing this style.  If Skrtel, Coates, Enrique, and GJ can't play this style and we don't replace them, then the system needs to change.  And we can't make that judgement after 1 year.

Yes, you are right that playing only 1 holding midfielder is a mistake for this time, at this point, but as you said, we've only done it a few times.  Those instances cannot be seen as a particular flaw of BR's until they become repeated (and more than a few games).

Lastly, I think you'll see, if you read my post again, that I am not defending Rodgers's every move.  He is not flawless.  I should've made it more apparent that I agree that our 2-man holding midfield is a must with our current talent and technical ability.  My issue is with letting a handful of mistakes--that should be chalked up to a complete revamp of our playing style and new manager--completely cloud the perception of a new manager's system and ability.

You're absolutely right, though, that these issues should be fixed by next year. I don't think anyone would say we should still be patient if Skrtel is here playing through balls to City next year.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Ha, well this is now my second reply to you, but the other poster did make quite a long post.

To me there is indeed a lot of work left to be done, but the positives this year have been phenomenal.  

We are scoring goals again.  This is *huge* for me.  Under the last years of Rafa, under Roy, and under Kenny we were not a high-scoring team despite having some top-notch attacking talent.  

Further, we are playing a style befitting the club that invented pass-and-move.  I love it.  We should have a style that stays with the club and isn't necessarily dictated by the manager.  

We've also bought really well, I think.  Allen was a bit overpriced (probably close to ¬£10 - ¬£12 million), but showed in a long run of games that he can be excellent at his role, and Assaidi's and Borini's futures are in the air, but won't be huge losses even if they never play again for Liverpool (especially given their relatively small fees for the numbers they both had and their ages).  Otherwise, ¬£8.5 million for Coutinho, ¬£12 million for Sturridge, and ¬£1 million for Yesil look like excellent buys.  

Also, we restructured and trimmed our wage bill so that we are very financially secure, especially given our status and size as a club. Along with this, we rightly refused to succumb to the silly demands of Fulham to buy Dempsey, and moved a ways to regain our reputation as a club that isn't pushed around and taken advantage of in the transfer market.

Our youth system is producing again.  Suso, Wisdom, Sterling, and Robinson have already showed themselves to be capable of delivering on the first team level (With varying degrees of consistency, of course), and Ibe, McLaughlin, Adorjan, and Morgan all seem like they might make the jump to the first team squad in the next year or two.  How many players just 2 or 3 years ago dd our academy have that we'd even say looked likely to get promoted and stay in the first team?

I guess, for me, there are a lot of exciting positives about the year, so ""underwhelming"" is the last word I used to describe my feelings, especially given that Rodgers didn't have the fanfare of Guardiola or Benitez in coming in.

Anyhow, I've gone and made another long post--whoops.  Cheers for the discussion.",0,1365547431,null,0,false,0,c9bwm4a,t3_1bzi9x,t1_c9bwm4a,t1_c9bvsib,null,1431614633,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,astrolabe,null,null,"I don't mean to be rude, but it sounds as though you don't really understand bitcoin very well yet.  Quite a lot of people have accidentally lost their money through accidentally deleting or losing their private keys.

You should encrypt and backup the wallet, ideally before you transfer any money to it.  Make sure you've got it straight in your head that you're backing up private keys and not the bitcoins: thus as Nikku_ said, if you add more coins after the back-up they'll still be accessable through the backup.

When you encrypt the wallet or change the password, your backups become invalid, and you need to make them again.

You shouldn't spend from the same address twice.  The qt wallet protects against this by, whenever you spend money, secretly creating a new address to put the change in.  This means that as you carry out more transactions, the number of addresses used increases in general.  The backup operation actually saves 100 future addresses too, but if after 100 or so transactions, you should re-backup the wallet, even if you don't see many addresses, the client will have made them.

BitcoinQT uses a lot of disk space (about 9Gb at the moment, and growing) because it stores the entire blockchain.  This took about 12 hours for my computer, which has a decent internet connection.  I've heard that you shouldn't do any transactions using the client unless it is up to date.

It's quite easy to shoot yourself in the foot with bitcoin.  You have to stay on top of things.  If you store significant quantities of  bitcoins on your computer, you should probably pay for anti-virus software.  I read somewhere that if your internet browser has lots of annoying toolbars that you never use, you probably don't have the skills to keep bitcoins safe.

You can look at the amount stored at an address by searching for the PUBLIC address here http://blockexplorer.com/ (use the 'Search' button).

On the other hand, I disagree that the gravitational field keeping it's rings in orbit would disappear. Given the evidence (the planet collapsing in on itself, the rings keeping form post-disappearance, you see it 'collapse' into itself and we all know matter cannot just vanish like that) it's more likely that, rather than disappearing, the planet turned into a black hole. Contrary to popular belief, black holes are just a mass that has no real substance and an event horizon. In other words: As long as the mass remained the same (because memories do not have mass) the gravitational pull would not have changed one iota from when the planet was still 'there' in the visible sense.  

I do know that the entire premise of The Impossible Planet was that it was orbiting around a black hole, but that was most likely an anomaly because it was a MUCH larger black hole and it was odd that the planet was still there having already fallen into the threshold where it could not possibly orbit.

Moreover, I couldn't care less about her ""popularity"" and I wasn't saying the poll takers who deemed her so were wrong, or unintelligent.

&gt;In February 2010, the NUS was heavily criticised after two of its officers forced a proposed debate on multiculturalism at the University of Durham to be cancelled. The debate, organised by Durham Union Society, was to have featured two prominent British National Party members: Andrew Brons MEP and Leeds City Councillor Chris Beverley.[8] Upon hearing of BNP involvement in the debate, NUS Black Students' Officer Bellavia Ribeiro-Addy and NUS LGBT Officer Daf Adley jointly sent a letter to both Durham Union Society and the university demanding its cancellation. The pair incorrectly stated that the debate would be illegal and threatened to organise a ""colossal demonstration"" in tandem with Unite Against Fascism, adding that **""if any students are hurt in and around this event responsibility will lie with you""**. The subsequent cancellation of the debate by Durham Union Society President Anna Birley on safety grounds was met with fierce backlash. NUS President Wes Streeting was prompted to personally appear before Durham Union Society to apologise for the actions of the officers concerned, though outrage among Durham students was sufficient that a significant number protested outside the debating chamber at the time. A further protest group on Facebook quickly amassed over 2,500 members. An official petition was soon lodged with Durham Students Union to call for a referendum on disaffiliation from NUS. On 12 March 2010, the referendum concluded with a majority of voting students having voted to disaffiliate.",0,1365549382,null,0,false,0,c9bxcue,t3_1bzizz,t1_c9bxcue,t1_c9bpf9h,null,1431614284,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

The outline of my argument is that whilst wages/income increased for majority of earners (This is a fact that I cannot contest), taxes for all but the highest earners as a proportion of income actually increased. Income tax may have been reduced, but other forms of taxation meant that those on middle and low incomes were paying a higher percentage of their income to the government (Through a VAT rate which almost doubled from 8% to 15%) and from the poll tax (And subsequent council tax that replaced it).

The commercialisation of utilities led to higher prices for consumers, despite there being an illusion of competition. The selling off of council houses have had a long-term impact on the poorest in society, creating the problem that we are having today with the lack of social housing and unaffordable private rental properties.

The decline of the manufacturing, ship building and mining industries (Whilst not solely attributed to Thatcher's reforms, you can't deny that her reforms contributed to their decline, rather than work to reverse the negative trend), particularly in the north of the country, devastated the local economies. Unemployment rose, but the vital industries that some towns relied upon disappeared, leading to a complete lack of investment and growth meaning that these areas have never fully recovered.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Wow, that's a few questions in one there. I'll try my best but if you'd like anything explained better/in more detail, let me know :):

""What are McD really like to work for?""

Depends entirely on the store you're in, IME. The store I'm in has two types of employee who're there long term - those who are there for the work, the money and the reference, and those who want to be management and climb the ladder.

I'm one of the former as are most of us at the store I work in. For us, it's reliable work if you're reliable and show up for work. It's a means to an end. That said, my colleagues are a great bunch. They're nice guys and that makes the difference for me.

""Are they the capitalist union hating scumbags or do they look after people properly?""
Here in the UK, *everyone* has the right to union representation. I am a member of a union, but McDs doesn't recognise or affiliate with on particular union. If I had a work place dispute, I could seek legal aid and representation from them though.


""Is (sic) there much promotion opportunities in a branch or does the franchise owner rule with an iron fist? Are people really that rude to you for no reason whatsoever?""

Not all McDs are franchises. I work in a company one. I've not worked in a franchise so can't make a comparison myself, but the place I work in ""feels"" more organised and together. 


""Are people really that rude to you for no reason whatsoever?""

Yes. The sheer level of arrogance and rudeness I see from the general public astounds me. I try incredibly hard to be friendly and polite. I'm always smiling and will go out of my way to help anyone that sets foot in the store. 

People treat you like crap if you work somewhere like that. Even if I was working there full time and even if I decided to spend the rest of my working life there, it's nobody's fucking prerogative to belittle me for that. People need to do whatever makes them happy, and if they're not draining money away from the State? I don't care what they do for work.

In my 2 years there, I have been not only verbally assaulted, also physically attacked, threatened, had to deal with junkies and the damn mess they leave behind. I have had to deal with people actively taking drugs in our toilets and I have had to call the emergency services. I've had someone pull a knife on me and someone else threaten to stick me with a sharp.

I get treated like crap, but it's by customers for the most part. The managers are mostly great guys and girls who treat us with decency, respect and courtesy. More than can be said for the customers.


My take on it is this - I could have not taken the job. But then I would have been unemployed for longer. I maybe would not have been able to go back to College and I wouldn't then be going to Uni. I sure could not have afforded to get married and have started to save for a deposit on a property. I didn't want to take the job, but I didn't fancy turning down work either. Ultimately, I'm glad I did it, and I would urge anyone who is out of work who is offered a job there to take it. It's better than falling into the trap of being long-term unemployed, and at any rate, you're paid every 2 weeks, and notice period is usually a week but there's usually folk wanting extra shifts, so you can get round it anyways.

There's worse things to be doing, but then again, I was raised to see the welfare state as what you turn to when you can't find *any* job, not when you don't like and turn down the job you're offered. 

If McDs has taught me one thing above all else it is that there is no shame in working there. There's no shame in working at all. But if you want to improve your life, you need to work for it. Yup, I work at McDonalds. But it doesn't have to be forever if I don't want it to.

true,SplurgyA,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"The ""All American Ads"" series? I love those!

I have cherry picked the examples here, it is true, but they are an attempt to illustrate a wider trend. For example, young girls being sexualised is an increasing trend - one amusing example here is the [Daily Mail hypocrisy](http://screenagers.me/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chestswell.jpg) over Brass Eye, a TV show that satirised media hysteria.

&gt;A lot of ads featured pretty women but not in a sexualized way. They were typically featured in ads with a pretty wife and their pretty children.

I feel I maybe was a bit shoddy in explaining my point. I was not saying that sexism in adverts had been traditionally sexual objectification; back in the day we were generally a lot more prudish. I was trying to say that the sexism in ads has shifted from ""women as home makers"" to ""women as sex objects"". And yes while some of those films did feature bad men, some of them were supposed to be heroes. The husband in Le M√©pris is not shown to be a bad man for hitting his wife for backtalking him (and they lovingly make up) while in McLintock!, John Wayne gets Maureen O Hara back by paddling her. Certainly wife beating or wife spanking [was often considered acceptable, even necessary](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/web04/2012/7/6/15/enhanced-buzz-4396-1341604023-0.jpg).

1979 was because Jim Callaghan and 1970s Labour literally bankrupted this country and turned it into a total fucking wasteland, moreso than people might claim Thatcher did.  The IMF bailed us out in 1976.

1983 was because Michael Foot had a catastrophically bad manifesto which not even Thatcher's victims were remotely enthused by

1987 was because Neil Kinnock seems to have focussed rightly or wrongly on strengthening the vote Labour already had, rather than try to reel in *new* voters

If the young, charismatic and exciting Tony Blair hadn't become Labour leader following the untimely death of John Smith, then I think John Major might have been able to hang on and eke out unbroken Tory rule into the new millennium.  Smith was an excellent and much loved politician but he implied himself in an interview that he didn't want to be PM.

Kinnock survived nine years and *two* election defeats before stepping down [rather than being sacked].  I reckon Thatcher might have dragged on longer than 1990 if it hadn't been for the poll tax and her party stabbing her in the back.  The poll tax was a reckless step too far, even by her standards and I think her ministers knew it was a shitty idea but let her away with it because they knew it would finish her off.",0,1365552430,null,0,false,0,c9byho4,t3_1bykm1,t1_c9byho4,t1_c9bi7wt,null,1431613677,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,SplurgyA,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"A lot of advertising does target women and I did pick some pretty severe examples... but generally speaking most of the sexual objectification stems from ads targeted to men such as cars, beer, menswear - things that men are considered a ""core demographic"" to. For a lot of adverts targeted to women there are very rarely sexualised images; I cannot ever remember seeing a scantily clad woman advertising washing powder, but a scantily clad woman advertising beer is relatively common.

I would argue that violence against men in adverts, at least in the example you posted, is subversive rather than problematic. There is not a general problem with women being aggressive to and beating up men. I mean obviously it is important to remember it does go on and men can be victims of domestic abuse, but the advert you posted would have very different connotations if it was a male robot beating up a woman.

Also I think there is scope for artistic expression; I am not saying all adverts should be prefixed with a short film about equality set to ""I am woman hear me roar"". I can appreciate the artistry in an advert like [this](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/2/7/7/enhanced-buzz-wide-9087-1360240918-4.jpg) but also recognise that frequently depicting women in vulnerable positions being dominated by men in all sorts of adverts can lead to certain attitudes about women leaching into the collective unconcious.",0,1365552477,null,0,false,0,c9byi8f,t3_1bzb0x,t1_c9byi8f,t1_c9bwlg6,null,1431613671,37,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,37

You negotiate with your creditors and make token payments. You may end up with a CCJ but as you have nothing of worth it will be unenforceable.

If you haven't saved enough money to service your debts for a short 4 month period of unemployment then that is your own fucking fault and perhaps less pissing your money up the wall when you were earning  and putting even as little as ¬£20 a week aside for just a year or two wouldn't have resulted in you not being able to.

My gripes with this are thus: 

- Government is not a company

- Even if it were, companies are economic with their travel expenses. 

- Even if government were a company, it would be extra important for them to be economical with their travelling expenses, as they are publicly funded rather than privately.

I'll tell you some tidbits that I found interesting, and hopefully, you do too:

- My friend's grand-dad was one of the people who created that infamous rope bridge at Carrick-a-Rede.  There were three people, if I'm not wrong, who made it, and it originally just had 3 ropes (before the upgrade) - scary stuff, eh?  Just a question though, would you have walked across it if it wasn't windy?  I doubt I'd have the balls to, personally.

- The main building at Queen's (it's actually far larger than just that main campus) was built on the wrong building plans.  At the time, three universities were being built in Ireland:  Queen's College, Cork; Queen's College, Galway; and of course, Queen's University Belfat, as part of the Queen's University of Ireland initiative.  There was a mix-up in the building plans though, and, IIRC, the [white stone of Cork's campus](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/University-College-Cork-Panorama-2012.JPG) was meant to stand where the Belfast's campus is.

* I went to the school that educated most of the engineers of the Titanic, it was recently the Titanic's 100th anniversary and it was a sad affair: an alumni owned Harland &amp; Wolff (the company that made the Titanic) at the time, and the head engineer was also an alumni, as were several other senior officials in the company.  This was the school I went to, you probably past it without noticing: http://img3.photographersdirect.com/img/13886/wm/pd2129601.jpg

* We had loads of other famous people too!  The guy who invented the modern layout of the department store (stock in the back; items on display up front), the guy who came up with the concept of 'delivering' items by post (could've been the same guy) - they both (or if it was the same guy) died millionaires.  Lord Kelvin, who discovered the absolute zero in water, and has a unit of measurement named after him - the Kelvin.  The guy who invented the portable defribulator.  The guy who invented the concept for *Who Wants to be a Millionaire?* (he went on to run his own entertainment studio - co-producing *Slumdog Millionaire* and *The Descent*; both terrific films, which I recommend!)  Hmm.. we've also had the poet John Hewitt and Frank Ormsby has basically adopted this as his home too.

* Last point is that the half-dead shopping centre, The Odyssey, is only ever fun when there's a concert or such happening: the it's *packed* and the Pizza Hut inside it has a waiting time of two hours - and people are prepared to wait!

true,spazmatt527,null,null,"Advertisers do this *because it works*. The stereotypes about men liking beer, cars and women, and the stereotypes about women liking shopping, playing dress-up and fit, strong men *don't come from nowhere*. There was a study done (forgive me for not digging up a link to this) while studying transgendered people that showed when put into a room with toy cars, G.I. Joes, barbie dolls and teacup sets, *most* boys would run straight to the cars and G.I. Joes, while the girls would run towards the barbie dolls and teacup sets. This study was done to demonstrate that these natural inclinations aren't just stereotypes, but real patterns.

So when you show a scantily clad woman in a Budweiser advertisement, that ad is showing two things (many) males naturally enjoy: beer and hot women. Where you and I disagree is that I won't go so far as to say that the opinions of the people who made the advertisement are that women are just ""objects"" or ""toys for male pleasure"".

Just because a train get's blown up in an action movie doesn't mean the script writer condones blowing up trains. Just because a rape scene is in a drama movie doesn't mean the write condones rape. Just because the movie Paul had a couple scenes where Paul won some religious debates doesn't mean the movie Paul as a whole was too ""preachy"" about atheism (there were many complaints about this).

And you know what? Let's go there: what is so wrong about objectification? Where did we get this egotistical dignity from? [You were once shoved head first through someone's vagina. Why are you acting so dignified?](http://xkcd.com/291/) Who *cares* if someone thinks of you as an object? In a sense, *you are*. You and a dining table are just a bunch of atoms. Sure, *different arrangements* of atoms, but atoms nonetheless. The only difference is that you attach *meaning and significance* to one and not the other. So what if someone thinks of me on par with their dining table? What a WASTE of time to get offended over that!

I wouldn't give two shits if there were thousands of ads everywhere objectifying men. If some chick only wants to think of me as a fuck toy, then that's awesome! I will feel complimented, because people who seek out fuck toys *generally* pick ones they find attractive, so that would indicate that they think I'm attractive. I don't *need* them, or everyone, to think of me as a special, unique snowflake; I'm more secure than that. *I* know that I'm a human, and that's good enough. My GF knows. My family and friends know. Why do people complain about this so much? ""He only wants me for my body!"", ""He just wants to fuck me!"". **SO??!!** Take it as a compliment and move on if you're not interested in having a fuck buddy. Does every guy have to think of you as a potential girlfriend? Jesus.

Let me ask you this: is there any way an advertisement could show sexuality involving a woman and not instantly get deemed by you as being ""objectifying"" women? Showing boobs, legs and ass isn't necessarily objectification, you know. And, even if it is, you still have to justify why that's bad.

Oh, and as for that batman comic you posted, many, *many* women find traditional batman type men to be attractive. Same goes for the ""muscle-bound hulks"". Also, many women *do* want to look like the hot, stereotypical comic book women, or like the playboy, vogue, maxim women. If you're going to claim that the muscle-bound hulk stereotype is there to please male power fantasies, then you have to also admit that the hot, big-boobed chick feeds female power fantasies; a hot, sexy, big-boobed woman has power over any man...just watch James Bond for example, haha! The muscle-bound man is what many men want to be because they think it's what women want (and to an extent, they're right). The hot, skimpy-clothed chick is what many women want to be because they think it's what men want (and to an extent, they're right).",0,1365558522,null,0,false,0,c9c0sob,t3_1bzb0x,t1_c9c0sob,t1_c9byi8f,null,1431612591,-15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-15

For William Hartnell it's the first. That's his best season as well as what we're celebrating at the 50th!

For Patrick Troughton I'd suggest his last. That's the one with the best companions as well as the best episodes.

For Jon Pertwee I'd suggest season 10. That has the first Multi-Doctor story, as well as being a great season for outside-of-UNIT stories. You'll also get a taste of the Master, who's season is another to check out.

For Tom Baker i wish I could suggest everything, but instead if you're only to watch one season watch his first. That had a lot of his best stories, like 'Genesis of the Daleks' and, yes denidzo, The Arc in Space.

Sadly peter didn't have a lot of 'good' episodes, per say, but his strongest was season 20, which had a great charactor arc as well as the 20th Anniversary Story (and other good ones! ;))

Colin Baker had A LOT of great stories, but I'd suggest his first season, which had, amoung others, the classic story 'Attack of the Cybermen'.

For Sylvester McCoy it'd have to be his last season, as well as the last of the show. It not only shows an interesting charactor arc that was starting, but it also was the last before it all stopped.

And of coarse don't forget the 1996 Telemovie, an underrated masterpiece starring Paul Mcgann as the Eighth Doctor. ;)

There's a good place to start with each Doctor. That's 7 seasons of fun waiting for you to embark on! :D Go get 'em Tiger!

Completely disagree, it's been proven time and time again. Any time an official source is unnamed there is a high likelihood that it is being dishonest or misleading in some way. If they were being honest there would be no need to obfuscate the source, this isn't whistle blowing. 

This isn't a problem UK wide, it seems mostly limited to the MET. Their cosy relationship with the press isn't exactly a secret. Every controversial action they have taken has had an element of this. Ian Tomlinson is the ultimate example, [where the media was managed down to a T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ian_Tomlinson#How_the_story_emerged).

To be able to watch anything, you MUST be downloading it. The only differences between streaming it on a site like that and simply ""downloading it"" is that a)As soon as you close the page or your browser, the video is removed from your ram or cache. b)You start playing it as soon as you have downloaded enough bytes. And depending on how you would be downloading it, c)Streaming would have it done all in order from 1 place, d)It would not be compressed into split archives.

&gt; I'm not using them for commercial use. I'm not making money off the show. I am simply watching an episode of a television show, that is available for free, on the Internet.

Which is available for free *against the wishes of the content/copyright owner*. And for what it's worth, YOU aren't making money off it, but the site owner is making money off you and you're just going along with that. Why? Because the videos are hosted on free video platform sites, so all the site owner needs to pay for is the hosting for the actual site (as opposed to the TB worth of disk usage and bandwidth). I just went onto it and went to a video, and in that time was graced with around 16 adverts in total. On three extremely small low-processor intensive and low-bandwidth intensive pages?
