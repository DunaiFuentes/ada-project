I think Martha got the short end of the stick more than the other companions, too. Unrequited love aside, she keeps getting stuck in places/times that force her to have a boring, everyday job for extended periods of time. In Human Nature/Family of Blood, she gets stuck in 1913, and has to deal with sexism from men and racism from everybody. Not to mention the fact that she's smart enough to be in med school, and she's stuck scrubbing floors. And then in Blink, she has to get a job in a shop while she and the Doctor are stuck in the past.

So because one happens more frequently than the other that makes it a different league? No it is still people using the street as their own personal bathroom. Can you explain why how common the acts are matters? Aside from it being a money spinner of course. You also need to address the Gutka issue, which I suspect is one of the reasons behind these fines being brought in. 

&gt;But criminalising this behaviour is not the way to go.

In principle I agree fully with that, for a whole host of reasons including how enforceable it is and that the police are overworked enough anyway. If it isn't enforced it won't make a jot of difference. But to change any behaviour in people it has to come with a penalty.

There's obviously a requirement for live streaming and archival, not to mention the costs of producing the video in the first place. There's also some titling going on, including the name of the person speaking and the part of the agenda being covered.

There's only 8 videos up now, but I imagine that the contract will mandate the archival of meetings for as long as they need to be archived. Also it's worth bearing in mind that HCC typically goes out to the private sector following a tender process with clearly defined rules and criteria. Perhaps I'm overdoing the clearness of the defined requirements (certainly in my experience of bidding on council projects that's often an area with a shortfall, although I've never bid on anything for HCC) but [the company](http://www.public-i.info/) behind it seems to specialise in meeting these sorts of requirements.

How is it that many foreign students aren't from wealthy families yet are still affording the fees for a masters degree? Their families prioritise education over anything else and saved up the money, perhaps for years, to afford the qualification. We in the UK expect far too much and think someone else should pay for it.

It is worth mentioning that foreign students, particularly those from Arab and Asian countries, and some African countries are well subsidised by their government/grant providers to do a masters qualification over here. 

I can only speak for the life sciences, but often life science degrees in Arab countries are not considered as 'stringent' or 'difficult to pass' as equivalent UK degrees, by the rest of the employing world.

Which is obviously where MA degrees should recruit people from.
I didn't even apply for a MA degree, I spent a hell of a lot of time researching into the idea and found funding incredibly limited and assigned to as I said before rather esoteric areas of study that didn't match mine. I couldn't self fund myself as people from rich backgrounds do, so essentially I had no choice other than to not apply. I'm not being arrogant here but had I applied to a Russell Group standard university for an MA History degree, I'd have got in to at least one but what was the point when I couldn't pay for it? ...it should also be noted that an MA in History would also open doors in archive work, library work, public policy, political research etc. It's not just a case of 'LOL I WANTZ 2 WRITE ABOUT HITLER!'

He was offered alternative accommodation i.e. an absolute tiny shit hole with damp, wallpaper hanging off the walls, bare floorboards and cockroaches in some far out suburb of Hounslow and had no choice but to go there.  It's miles away from his family and friends with even worse prospects of finding a job than he had before. 

One year on he's sunk into a massive depression and every time I see him he seems to have gotten worse to the point where I'm worried about what he's going to do. His long term girlfriend left him too which doesn't help. His mothers contacted social services over that way, they've put him on a list but they don't seem that interested because he's a single male. 

That's what's happening right now in our capital. You lose your job and can't find another one straight away, you're fucked. Social cleansing.

These days the BBC doesn't force their presenters to speak using this (and probably hasn't been doing this since the 1970s). I guess the news is the closest left to a bastion of receieved pronounciaton - but presenters like Huw Edwards definitely do have placeable accents.

The English 'ear' for accent is very strong - as the old joke goes 'How do you get one British person to hate another?' 'Get them to say hello' - Accent is loaded with information about location, perceived class, education and a dozen other social cues. I hate to break it to you but if you are French the first thing you will sound to me when speaking English is ... *French*. 

BBC radio stations:

**Radio 1**: Music for young people - contemporary pop and new releases. Delivery is high energy and likely to contain lots of contemporary slang. **Warning**: No one else on the planet speaks English in the same manner as Tim Westwood  - do not attempt to copy.

**Radio 1 Extra** Same as above but for 'Urban' music. 

**Radio 2**: Recent and contemporary music. Radio 2 is where Radio one DJs get farmed out to once they hit 30 in BBC radios version of Logans Run. Radio 2 also plays a slightly more diverse and varied  remit of music than Radio 1

**Radio 3**: Classical music. At the proper level of appreciation of the output of Radio 3 you should of course turn your radio off so the music will not be sullied by you actually listening to it. This music is better than you.

**Radio 4**: Arts, Drama, Science, Comedy A wide selection of programs covering varied topics. Please note: the law banning men from listening to Womans Hour was overturned in the same bill that allowed homosexuals to marry, you need no longer fear being tracked down by Jenni Murray and beaten with her Fabulous Batons.

**Radio 4 Extra** Repeats of old radio 4 programs. 

**Radio 5 Live** Rolling News coverage and Sport. Ocasionally well behaved presenters from Radio 5 are allowe dto present on 'proper stations' like Radio 4. It is amusing to listen to them try. Bless them. 

**Radio 5 Live Sports Extra** Coverage of sport the BBC payed to cover but noone actually wants to listen to. Also Cricket.

1) Unfair system, postgraduate degrees don't attract a student loan. That means you must have the savings or a family to help you out.

2) This will soon become the norm. Currently this is the general norm in Science subjects already. Many science students do an ""undergraduate masters"" (i.e MChem rather than Msc).

3) If it becomes the norm, all it does is extend the process further. If everybody has a Masters, you have to be a PhD to be distinct. This is happening across some Scandinavian countries. In Finland, for example, a Masters is the norm and a Bachelors isn't really considered an end result (unless im mistaken, it was only implemented as a comparative to other EU states). 

4) The result is 'brain drain'. Your top graduates leave your country and head off elsewhere, after suckling at the your education system. Of course, you can avoid losing your investment in the youth if you force all students to pay their own education fees in their entirety, and in which case, see point 1 and consider the absolutely mammoth of debt the young will have to be in, in order to get a decent job.

Part of the problem is, however, that graduates - like myself - leave University believing that the world owes them and, by God, this country is lucky to have us. Our Universities constantly assert how they're the best University (my Russell Group University where I also my Post Grad asserts that they are the number one target for graduate employers, either we went to the same University or more than one say the same). So when we leave University, with no skills beyond studying and drinking, we apply for the top quality jobs - full on researchers, managers, policy makers, scientific project co-ordinators etc. and then when we don't get them we complain that there's no work. The concept of working our way up is as distant as the moon. Now, that's not entirely our fault. We get told from school, from our parents and from the Universities themselves, that if we do a degree - or even a postgraduate - then we wont have to do shitty work. In reality, we do. We were lied to, we need to get over that.

The truth is, Universities lie to us. Universities spend their money doing research, not on the students. My university life consisted of sitting in my room reading and writing a few essays here and there. I was told this was ""independent learning"" - maybe so, but it was nothing like the real world. When I joined the working world, I hadn't a clue about the basics - I wasn't familiar with office life and, yes I could explain the concepts of political legitimacy, but I lacked the basic office skills. I've now managed to get them (I believe).

The first hurdle for graduates is to accept that they have to learn the ways of the world too. You can't start off in the best job ever, go out and work first.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"The Gutmann method was built for drives that use older MFM and RLL interfaces, not modern SATA or even then standard IDE drives.

Modern hard drives have all sorts of cooky gadgetry inside them to cope with the increased platter density and to increase lifetimes by reducing wear (remember that hard drives are mechanical devices, for the purpose of this comment I am not referring to SSDs as hard drives). It's this technology that allows a drive to cache writes until the drive head is in the right position to write, and to do things like marking sectors as deleted when they aren't.

Even Gutmann himself has talked about the problems applying his (and Plumb's) method to modern drives. Typically the number of wipes is dependent on the drive and you gain nothing after a certain point.

Most modern drives support a secure erase function built into the ATA spec but the implementation varies from vendor to vendor.

In terms of software overwrite technology, the only thing I've seen that causes me problems when doing recovery is [Blancco](http://www.blancco.com/uk/frontpage/). I have to admit, that in years of doing forensic recovery I haven't tried to recover from a [DBAN](http://www.dban.org/)ned disk, but generally software overwrite won't result in a guaranteed removal of a file.

As an aside, there's a difference between deleting a file and wiping a disk. The police are quite right in that they can't guarantee that they can delete the file and give him back the files.

If you can choose to house two or even three families elsewhere, or one in London, I think it's only fair to do the former since there are currently many many needy people waiting. Rather than look at the families that leave London, look at the additional families we can house because one family left London. Think of those children who get a stable home, or those parents - or just adults - who get the opportunity to start building their life and support themselves.

I really don't like the idea of pushing benefit families out of London, but at the same time, isn't it sort of our duty to try and help as many as possible rather than just a few? So long, of course, as we're not destroying anybody's standard of living - I would never agree to moving them to some god forsaken corner of the UK. I just mean, moving from the capital to the outskirts or another big city.

I would like to live in London Zone 1 or 2, or hell, Camden is a pretty fashionable area - I'd go there - in a house - but I can't afford to, I really really can't.   

People talk about people having to live in damp and cold places - but i'll be honest with you - graduates in London don't live in palaces. It's a shared studio with a partner, or a house share, which seem to normally be riddled with mold, cold and damp. My first place in London resulted in me having to throw clothes away or boil wash them because the mold grew all in my wardrobe, despite my efforts. I wont even begin to discuss how cold it was there. 

Nobody should live like that, but please don't start preaching to me that we must support people from living in those conditions, while I go and work and have to live in those very same conditions.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"I'm a bit saddened about the discussion on here going on about how easy it is to securely delete files. It's a lot more complex than people think.

Take NTFS, the most commonly used filesystem today. NTFS stores multiple backups of the pointers to files, as well as caching them in various places. That's before you even get to any third party applications that may cache the files you want to delete. It's not like you can just search for duplicates of the file, you need to think about thumbnails, image format conversions and recompression. FAT file systems (as used on small thumb drives and SD Cards) are a bit simpler, but you still can't guarantee you're wiping the bit of the drive you think you're deleting because if you overwrite the file there's no guarantee you're hitting the same part of the disk.

As for wiping the disk, those of you who are talking about Gutmann wipes, or software overwrites are for the most part, wrong. Software overwrites offer variable write capabilities. The ATA Secure Erase standard is supposed to provide better quality but the implementations vary from drive vendor (and firmware) to drive vendor (and firmware).

Of course, wiping the disk is missing the point - he won't get his porn back if the whole disk is wiped. If you think the police should go out and buy another drive to put his porn on while they blat his existing drive, copy it back on sans the child porn (and all potential cached copies or metadata wherever they may lie) and then give it back to him, then that's not really realistic.

The police don't have the capability to do complex forensics and anti-forensics (by and large, although some forces have some limited capabilities), so you're talking about them sending it out to a specialist who will charge like a wounded rhino to solve the issue to an evidential standard.

The police are fully within their legal rights to keep the drive, which versus the potential blowback from accidentally distributing kiddie porn fragments I'm not surprised they're actually doing.

true,guernican,null,null,"Obviously. The Thatcher government sold off vast swathes of social housing to property developers, private landlords and so on. The last Labour government did virtually nothing to counteract the shortfall in affordable housing in the capital. The current mayor talks a reasonable game about ensuring the affordable housing is an intrinsic part of any major development, then when you go back and look at the figures you see that the ""affordable"" part has been scaled back enormously. Which is just what you'd expect from a wealthy, endemically Tory big business supporter with aspirations of taking the prime ministership. 

The point of all of this is that it's not these people's fault. The lack of investment in London is staggering, given how much is invested in making rich people's lives easier. 

Another example. I work in London. I have a decent job. I earn well. My partners earns ok. I had saved more than £50k to use as a deposit when we came to buy. When we did, there was precisely one non-stabby borough we could afford if we wanted a house. One. Assuming you're not thrilled living somewhere like Edmonton or Hounslow, choice is unbelievably limited. And, as I said, I earn ok.  

London gets disproportionate investment because it's the capital, the seat of government, the financial centre, a tourism centre, and all those other things. What it's not interested in is poor people. Why the hell should these families move to Liverpool? Sorry, guys... you may have lived all your life here. Your friends may be here, your children's education, everything you know. But it's too expensive now, so fuck off 250 miles up north. 

And don't give me this benefit scrounger shit. Every person on benefits is not a fucking scrounger. Times are hard. It's hard for people with good degrees to get work, never mind people with minimal qualification.s

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; NTFS stores multiple backups of the pointers to files, as well as caching them in various places.    

Right but nobody cares about references to data, they care about the actual data its self. If you zero out the actual content it doesn't matter how many times that content is referenced, it will be inaccessible.    

&gt; It's not like you can just search for duplicates of the file, you need to think about thumbnails, image format conversions and recompression.     

We're talking about an afternoon of work MAX. The police have already wasted more time and money on this case than that.   

&gt; FAT file systems (as used on small thumb drives and SD Cards) are a bit simpler, but you still can't guarantee you're wiping the bit of the drive you think you're deleting because if you overwrite the file there's no guarantee you're hitting the same part of the disk.    

What? The file system points to a start sector and a length, if you go to that sector and you zero out the length the content is gone. It is fairly well guaranteed in the context of what we know about how computers work (and how the FAT file-system works in particular).     

&gt; As for wiping the disk, those of you who are talking about Gutmann wipes, or software overwrites are for the most part, wrong.     

No they aren't. You are wrong. This post alone is full of nonsense and misinformation.    

&gt; Software overwrites offer variable write capabilities.    

Is that meant to be a criticism? What does that even mean? Are you saying that some secure wipe software sucks so we cannot trust ANY of it?    

&gt; If you think the police should go out and buy another drive to put his porn on while they blat his existing drive, copy it back on sans the child porn (and all potential cached copies or metadata wherever they may lie) and then give it back to him, then that's not really realistic.    

I do. It is 2013. Computers store a LOT of stuff - bills, important papers, receipt, pay-stubs, etc. What you're suggesting makes about as much sense as setting a filing cabinet on fire because they found an illegal picture in it.    

Just take the illegal picture out and return the filing cabinet (computer hard drive). The police's position on this makes no sense. If they knew that pictures were stored elsewhere on the drive then they should have brought those to trial against him, if they cannot then they need to just go ahead and return everything MINUS the known illegal content.    

They cannot do stuff just because they suspect there MIGHT be some illegal content.   

&gt; The police are fully within their legal rights to keep the drive, which versus the potential blowback from accidentally distributing kiddie porn fragments I'm not surprised they're actually doing.   

They *might* be in their legal right - I have no idea. Still wrong and short sighted.     

Computers are document storage facilities. They shouldn't be treated like someone's car or a television. They should be treated like a filing cabinet or folder of personal papers.

We need a more complete striker who can score from anywhere, make something from nothing, and while there are few players of this caliber I think Liverpool should do their best to secure one who is not in the process of maturing but already matured and ready to perform.

Anybody speaking with the old ""BBC accent"" on 2013 sounds like an insufferable snob. It is probably not what you want to model yourself on.

The fashion these days at the BBC is to try to pretend that they represent the whole country by including people with all sorts of accents. In practice, this means you'll hear a lot of strong accents from Northern Ireland and a few milder versions of accents from Scotland and the North of England, but mainly [Estuary English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary_English). None of this is what you're looking for, and not all of it is easily understood by people from other parts of the country.

If you want to hear very ""correct"" English, the your best bet is, as others have said, BBC Radio 4. The news and politics programmes in the morning are full of people educated at places like Eton and Harrow, Oxford and Cambridge, and they tend to have refined their accents to be very close to received pronunciation. If you want to model your speech on anyone, these would be the people. There's a programme on Radio 4 called ""Thinking Allowed"" that is available as a podcast and offers interesting insights into British society in every episode, and the host, Laurie Taylor, is a wonderful speaker. Another programme I like is ""In Our Time"", which is a round-table discussion about topics from history that again mostly features very highly-educated people who are often good speakers.

Well I have to ask where does it stop? Should you be allowed to burn his house down? I mean what if he had printed an image and hidden it somewhere officers weren't able to find?    

&gt; Imagine the chaos if the Police returned a drive, and then later some new piece of software came out that recovered even a single illegal image from a returned hard drive.    

Nobody would ever know. So there would be no ""chaos.""      

&gt; A better plan would be to copy out only those files the guy needs, verify them to make sure there's no indecent content, and destroy the original disk.    

I actually think that is a totally reasonable compromise. But they aren't offering him that.   

&gt; That takes a lot of time, and most Police forces I know of have backlogs (thanks to budget cuts).    

Right but unfortunately the police now have his data ""hostage."" They have a moral (and in an ideal world they would have a legal) duty to return his legal data to him. Just as they do with other non-digital possessions they seize.    

In general there seems to be a wanton disregard for digital assets. If, for example, police seize your car because they suspect you had drugs concealed in it but it turns out you did not you get your car back. If police take your filing cabinet because they suspect you had papers relating to fraud or similar in it, they return the papers NOT part of their case (and typically will eventually return all the papers).    

But when it comes to digital assets the police are happy to throw it all out even at the slightest unproven pretexts.  Family photos, bills, important papers, family video, BitCoins, etc, they all get deleted if there MIGHT be a single indecent image on the machine (even if we cannot prove it).    

Frankly this is all a generational thing. Older people simply do not ""get"" how intertwined digital storage is with younger people's lives. If you delete their digital storage you essentially wipe out a large chunk of their memories and vital information.    

PS - And before you say ""backups!!"" the police would almost always seize those too.

While this may not account for the thousands there are clearly enough homes in that bracket that it's worth thinking about taxing them extra.

I also didn't say we should force people to do anything with their property, I just find it obscene that the prices in the area are being driven up by investment homes that remain empty while we are going to force people out of their homes and away from that self same community.

Maybe a government scheme that maybe offered incentives to home owners to turn the empty property over for cheap social housing in short term rolling contracts might work? Then again that would probably help drive prices in the area down which is not what they want.

There is no such thing as a permanent deletion on computers unfortunately – or fortunately. There is no way of permanently deleting it, short of putting it through a shredder.""

This is a lie

Simply overwriting the header of the data makes it infeasibly difficult for most people to recover the data, overwriting it all a couple of times with random data makes it impossible for most police forensic technicians to recover it and overwriting it all, say, 35 times with alternately 00000000, 11111111, 10101010, 01010101 and random data makes it nigh-on impossible to recover short of examining it with an electron microscope!

This is not rare or obscure knowledge amongst computer scientists. 

Give Mr. Gerrard back his porn, give him compensation for his losses and for suffering caused at the hands of the police, and issue a public apology. Then fire the forensic technician Scott Eggins, and possibly charge him with contempt of court and perjury or attempting to pervert the course of justice.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"Is being civil something you're completely incapable of?

&gt; Right but nobody cares about references to data, they care about the actual data its self. If you zero out the actual content it doesn't matter how many times that content is referenced, it will be inaccessible.

Actually windows' own file recovery does. The metadata in question also extends to copies of data taken through the Volume Shadow Service, especially so if transactional NTFS is in use. A lot of this happens automatically in the background (e.g. with Windows snapshots when you ask but also when installing updates on some platforms a snapshot is taken. Also due to the way NTFS works, files are stored in clusters and are linked into chains. Clusters are moved around through the NTFS defragging mechanism, and the drive itself won't necessarily write the same data to the same place twice, so the disk can end up with multiple copies of the same data just through using the filesystem. If you can't recover a cluster in the chain but can scan through the disk you can sometimes find redundant clusters from NTFS cluster moves.

&gt; We're talking about an afternoon of work MAX. The police have already wasted more time and money on this case than that.

It won't be the police, it'll be a forensics/recovery firm like Kroll OnTrack or a University with a forensics consulting department like Glamorgan. They'll probably have to get whoever did the investigation to do anything on the disk to ensure that if anything shows up in the future (like he gets done for more child porn) that there's a properly handled chain of evidence.

&gt; What? The file system points to a start sector and a length, if you go to that sector and you zero out the length the content is gone. It is fairly well guaranteed in the context of what we know about how computers work (and how the FAT file-system works in particular).

Alright big man, show me how you guarantee you 'go to the sector' in a protected mode OS like Windows. When you delete a file in FAT the index in the allocation table is scrubbed. That's it. The data's still there. If you overwrite a file it's down to the drive's firmware to determine where the data goes which isn't necessarily the same whenever the file changes. But if you want to put your code where your seemingly large mouth is, be my guest.

&gt; No they aren't. You are wrong.

I guess [Gutmann's wrong too](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html) - see the epilogue at the bottom of the paper.

&gt; Are you saying that some secure wipe software sucks so we cannot trust ANY of it?

No. I'm saying software overwrite as a strategy has limitations, namely that it's reliant on the drive firmware and OS/API it uses telling it the truth which isn't always the case.

&gt; Like you?

Yeah like me.

There is a movement amongst uber liberals that always think when a criminal is convicted it is all about a path of rehabilitation and prividing a stable future.

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; The metadata in question also extends to copies of data taken through the Volume Shadow Service, especially so if transactional NTFS is in use.    

Right but presumably you would destroy data while the drive is off-line. You wouldn't plug it in, boot into the user's own OS, and then mash the delete key.    

&gt;  Also due to the way NTFS works, files are stored in clusters and are linked into chains. Clusters are moved around through the NTFS defragging mechanism, and the drive itself won't necessarily write the same data to the same place twice, so the disk can end up with multiple copies of the same data just through using the filesystem.     

That's what deduplication is for... Run it.     

&gt; Alright big man, show me how you guarantee you 'go to the sector' in a protected mode OS like Windows.    

I don't know what Windows' memory model has to do with anything? Or why you're using Windows to access this drive at all? Or why you think that while using Windows you cannot access the raw drive via \\.\PhysicalDrive0 for example?     

&gt; When you delete a file in FAT the index in the allocation table is scrubbed.    

You don't need to delete the file in FAT. You need to look up where the file is and delete the contents of the file its self.    

&gt; If you overwrite a file it's down to the drive's firmware to determine where the data goes which isn't necessarily the same whenever the file changes.     

I don't know what that means. Typically if you tell the firmware to over-write a block it is going to overwrite that block. The data doesn't ""go"" anywhere, it is overwritten.     

&gt; I guess Gutmann's wrong too - see the epilogue at the bottom of the paper.    

We're talking about some guy, not the NSA. I will confess, if the dude has an electron-microscope in his garage he MIGHT be able to recover a few pixels of image.    

&gt; I'm saying software overwrite as a strategy has limitations, namely that it's reliant on the drive firmware and OS/API it uses telling it the truth which isn't always the case.    

You can bypass the OS/API entirely. If we cannot trust the firmware then what can we trust? With SSDs things are a little complicated I grant, but by zeroing the file and then zeroing free space (unallocated space) we can /normally/ assure that the files are gone.    

At least up to a ""reasonable"" level. Again this is some random dude we're talking about not the NSA.   

&gt; Except for the bit where I've been doing this professionally since the 90s and worked on the standard for a pending certified forensic practitioner qualification, and spent the last decade and a half breaking into things and analysing break-ins. Other than that, just like me.   

Then I guess this explains why the police are acting so irrationally. They get irrational advice not based on technical merit.

I'm usually pretty liberal but I agree with punishment over rehabilitation in extreme circumstances, and this case was pretty damn extreme. Thinking back to age 10, I was very much in control of my own actions. I probably could have cooked a meal for myself, or held down some kind of other large responsibility without too much effort. But that isn't expected of kids; your parents cook and clean for you when you're 10 - you generally don't deviate much in your own right.

Taking a kid away from his mother and doing what they were doing took a lot of responsibility on their part. if they'd done this being 8 years older, there'd be no doubt there would be no attempt at rehabilitation. They would just be thrown in prison for 25+ years, ruining their chances of any decent future careers or any semblance of a normal life. Imagine an interview:

""Your CV leaves a large gap between when you left school and, well, just recently, Mr. Rellik...""

""Yeah I was incarcerated during that time for a crime I committed""

""Thank you, we're done here""

Imagine if a girlfriend found out; would she stay with you? You'd be lucky; you know she'd worry for her own safety, even if you had been rehabilitated by the life of prison, lifting weights and sitting around thinking about what you've done. Why would they risk their life?

and you've accepted that this is true, you claim that this is an edge case, but you've accepted that there can be no guarantees.

&gt;As for wiping the disk, those of you who are talking about Gutmann wipes, or software overwrites are for the most part, wrong. 

Is it this bit that you're not keen on? The science behind this kind of overwriting is beyond me but it strikes me as a moot point, nobody wants to wipe the drive in this case. The argument is about if its easy to erase the offending files and return the disk.

I am unfortunately not an avid listener of french radios, but the two main stations that are worth something (i.e. provide interesting content, not just news or music) that I can think of are ""France Culture"" and ""France Inter"". Don't really know what show to recommend though... If you're into christianity you can listen to ""RCF"" and if you like humor, ""Rires &amp; Chansons"".
You shouldn't worry too much about accents. I'd say the only distinct french accent there is comes from the south, typically around Marseilles (but you can hear it generally everywhere in the south of France). Another accent I would qualify as ""foreign"" comes from immigrants. I'm not saying this as a discriminatory quality, but african/middle eastern people do have a quite recognizable way to speak french, but this has as much to do with the vocabulary, interjections and idioms used than with the actual way they pronounce words. Although the Southern Accent I mentioned before is considered relatively acceptable (although we love to make fun of it) because it's so wide spread in a huge part of France and has been around for longer than anybody can remember, some people associate a ""foreign accent"" with negative connotations, even if the vocabulary and grammar used are not necessarily worse than that of ""normal"" french. Not sure if I'm being clear here, but anyway you probably won't encounter any ""foreign accent"" on the radio so long as you stick to the ones I mentioned. Some stations that appeal to younger people might be more liberal with the language. Actually I think it's more than just an accent, you can replace any previous mention of ""foreign accent"" with ""foreign dialect"". It's really as much a question of vocabulary and syntax as it is a question of accent. I think I'm trying too hard to explain something you probably won't encounter.

As much as this offends my some of my out-there sensibilities, as long as we continue being so, our quality of life shouldn't dwindle.  That said, the economy is something I don't really understand.  However, it's application has severe consequences for us.

Things just seem a lot more expensive.  If it were simply luxury items like iPods and Xboxes, I really wouldn't care, but transport prices perpetually rise and grocery shopping seems more expensive that a few years back, and my wages haven't risen accordingly.  And of course housing.  These are all the things I mildy reflect upon, things I doubt will ever plateau.

On the other hand, things which will effect my progeny, health-care and education, I'm quite optimistic on these.  I work in a school (not as a teacher though, I'm not that stupid) and honestly, every year there's the silly question of whether exams are getting easier, but no one actually asks whether the kids simply getting smarter.  Seriously, I think it's the latter and for that we have the teachers to thank.  

I see the exam papers and while I at the tender age of 31 think it's all a piece of piss, a 16 year old Gadget back in 1997 would not share that opinion at all.  Some of the GCSE Maths papers are covering topics I didn't touch until A-Level.

With Healthcare, even though we have all these fears of a superbugs et al, I feel secure knowing should I fall ill, I will be treated at little expense.  Sure, I run the risk of an incompetent doctor, but whatever, I won't be turned away or pursued for exorbitant fees.

This brings me to one (two, fool) last angst causing evil(s): old age and employment opportunities for the young.  The latter speaks for itself, though I will say this: at the moment I'm desperately trying for a career change (lies!  It's more accurate to say I'm trying to start my first career) but it is really difficult because the opportunities are simply too scarce, It's not enough to simply create jobs, we need to create jobs which people have trained to do (and at great personal cost) or jobs which people are content doing.

Even secure deletion programs can fail.

The problem is that hard disks have some over-provisioning, and will shuffle sectors around if they think a sector is failing. That sector will then be left unused, with whatever data it had on it when it was judged to be failing.

For flash drives, the case is a bit stronger - over-provisioning is much more important and more likely to be used, and blocks are shuffled around to avoid excess wear anyway, so when you overwrite a particular block number there's a very strong chance you're *not* overwriting the data you put in that block (the same logical block is now mapped to a different physical block).

So there *is* a theoretical justification. It's pretty stupid, though, if this is for files that might be downloaded automatically and by accident. So what if there's some small fragment of some illegal file that might theoretically be recoverable from the device when the files are out there, publicly available and getting downloaded automatically and by accident?

Here's the thing. The BBC is meant to be ""balanced"". This means it can air programs with very different perspectives as long as it airs a roughly equal number of programs for each perspective. This is just about understandable.

But it all falls down with BBC News. I go to the gym quite often and watch BBC News and whilst at the gym I naturally have time to let my mind wander. And what I think is this. It is impossible to be fair and balanced. It's a stupid requirement. We can get really technical here and start talking about the language newsreaders use. Language is whatever two people can successfully communicate with, thus it is dependent on the understanding and, more importantly, the acceptance of the language used by both parties. An example would be ""loyalists"", in reference to the Northern Ireland kerfuffle. Many disapprove of the use of that word, not wanting violence associated with being loyal to the UK. How do you possibly resolve that? Even if the majority don't mind, it's still not being balanced.

And it's definitely not unbiased. Language sways people a great deal. Hell, just reporting on something sways people. Sure, the Daily Mail intentionally uses this as a tactic, whereas BBC News doesn't, but the effect can still be the same.

The BBC receives so many complaints because everyone thinks they own it. And that's a problem. I'm really torn because I absolutely love BBC programming but I can't for the life of me work out how BBC News (which is also well-executed) can, in principle, be accepted as fair and unbiased.

Another example to finish. The other day a presenter was talking to a guy who's house had been broken into and who's son was threatened with an axe. The presenter finished off the conversation by saying ""such a harrowing experience"" and ""good luck to you"". That's an opinion. It might be one many people share, but it's an opinion that should simply not exist, in principle, on a publicly-funded news program. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying it's hideously bad, I'm just pointing out that surely such a thing goes completely against the BBC's mandate. How could they possibly justify it? What, in other words, is their philosophy or set of rules which explain what is and isn't okay? Because it seems to be really muddled.

It seems that someone in the past thought it would be a brilliant idea to have an unbiased news source. And then promptly set a load of guidelines without actually thinking in any depth about the subject. And now there are a load of ad-hoc rules to make up for that person's shortcomings. This is why newsreaders can't say certain words, but can say others. Despite the fact that an equal number of people might disapprove of the latter as do the former.

If they opted not to hire him on account of his political views, despite his obvious qualifications *THIS* would be political bias. Seriously, fuck the Telegraph.

Don't read this as ""I like Prunell"" I think he was an awful politician but, If I was in a senior position on a board of directors for a Media corporation and I saw a guy that had worked in the corporation before leaving to get highly relevant experience in an external organisation he would probably be on my list to interview.

&gt; “Many have long had suspicious about a metropolitan, leftist bias to the BBC’s output, particularly in news,” Mr Wilson said. “With the BBC under greater scrutiny in recent months, I find it hard to think why the BBC think a former Labour Cabinet Minister is an appropriate choice for a leadership role.”

Screw this guy, who would have people refused from positions of employment based on their political views. ""Oh, he's a bit left wing, he can't work here"" what kind of argument is that? They can't hire an experienced person because of his politics? This is an ideology that contradicts the basic rights of a free society - a man should be allowed a right to a living and an organisation should select on merit not on political bias.

Scanning the article again, I can see a quote from the tax payers alliance, why is this even here? They're just a right wing think tank funded by the same type of people that own the telegraph. This article is a lesson in how corporate influence subverts the press in order to sway political opinion. In this case the telegraph is using it's position as a respected publication amongst middle class right wingers in order to stir up animosity towards the BBC.

That is perjury. There is a gotcha, in that the delete operation provided by the operating system merely manipulates pointers. The file system won't actually scribble over the data until the disk fills up. But it is easy enough for a program to open a file in read/write mode and scribble over the data, then it is really gone. 

(It the CIA really want the data they can go to the NSA and ask them to do the electron-microscope thing. If the later writes were not accurately aligned with the earlier writes there is a slim chance of getting some data back, but this is harder than retrieving information from shredded paper documents.

If your brother gets 7.8k - can I ask how he lives?  That works out to £162.5/week which would cover rent and water rates - what about electricity or gas? food? Council tax is removed (so its not 7.8 but 9 - because that's 1.2k/year).

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;Why do people think its Appropriate to have 10 kids? Me and my wife would like to have 1 - but we can't afford it yet. 

That's irrelevant. If someone has 10 kids, then those 10 kids need to be supported. You're right to say that they probably shouldn't have had 10 kids, but to say that those 10 kids should be neglected and abused is simply fucked up. That's precisely what you are doing when you say that a family shouldn't be able to get so much in benefits and that's also what a cap on benefits does.

&gt;If nobody was affected by these caps - why does this thread even exist?

I never claimed that. I'm claiming that an individual living alone will not be affected by such caps, only large families will.

&gt;If your brother gets 7.8k - can I ask how he lives? That works out to £162.5/week which would cover rent and water rates - what about electricity or gas? food? Council tax is removed (so its not 7.8 but 9 - because that's 1.2k/year).

It was based on £150 a week. He gets £71 per week from ESA and about £70 per week housing benefit (this in in Liverpool). He has to pay £12.50 a week towards the rent so that leaves him with £58.50. I've no idea about his council tax or water rates. His gas supply was diconnected due to previous tenants owing the gas company money. The central heating is gas, but he can't afford it so hasn't bothered sorting it out. He's been complaining recently that his electricity costs have pretty much doubled over the past year or two, with him now spending £20 per week on electricity. That leaves him with £38.50 for everything else.

How does he live? Like a fucking king, obviously! A Plasma TV, one of each console and SkyHD in every room of his nice warm mansion. The fridge and cupboards fully stocked while he sits on his comfy chair in his dressing gown, complete with top hat and monocle. Ah, the joys of being a benefit scrounger!

Only Gerrard, Carra, Reina &amp; Suarez actually have any will to win. The rest are passangers, happy to put in an average performance and not really too arsed about the result. Thats how it looks anyway.

Im still to see what Joe Allen offers. He can recycle possession *okay* as long as theres not an opposition player within five yards of him but even then it's just a pass to Gerrard who actually tries to do something with the ball. Other than that the only danger he poses is to our own back four with his ridiculous passes on the edge of our area.

The only player capable of actually defending in the team is a 35 year old who is about to retire. Says it all.

There've been mistakes in *every part* of our defence this season which can only be due to some problem with coaching (or perhaps a complete group loss of form, but the coaching has to play some role there too?).

Also worrying: our tactics and play without Sturridge are so ying/yang it's shocking. Is Borini going to step up and start playing as an understudy to Sturridge to step in when he can't play?

Alternatively, use [Moneysavingexpert's Flight Checker](http://flightchecker.moneysavingexpert.com/) to find cheapo flights. Flying is always a bit of a hassle, especially on the budget airlines, but if you're really keen on going further afield (and stick to hand luggage!) then you can find some stonking deals.

For example a return to Dublin for a two-night stay costs £51.87, somewhere between Friday March 8 and Monday March 11. The same search criteria will take you to Poland for £63.26, Hungary for £86.35, and even Norway for just under a hundred. That's flights only, of course, and that'll be per person.

I'm not entirely sure what the solution is. Rodgers needs to be more quick on the subs, when you have someone not doing what you need in a crucial time, they go off and bring on someone who can get you closer to where you need to get. Obviously easily said than done.

I would just like to see us at least end the season with some progress/not completely shitting the bed every game. We can nose dive pretty badly and finish the season close to the depths if we keep this shit up.

Lastly I acknowledge that Zenit has had a lot of time off, they obviously were well prepped. Having a game 3 days back does take a lot out, and I understand that being a factor.

I know it may be a major stretch and pipe dream, but if we bring it down to penalties at Anfield, I'll take it. I need my dose of yearly Liverpool heartattacks.

If you look at his career in the premier league with West Ham and LFC he has always been such a reliable squad player with such accurate passing. The only thing that stopped him was his size and strength, he would be a monster if he was larger. He's one of those players you take for granted just a solid C+ to B- every time, when healthy. Happy he's getting some play now especially since we are in need of deep lying Midfielders. Here's a little something for you.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I'm not seeing anything that could indicate a positive outcome for keeping Warnock on now. He's forced Becchio out of the club, been making digs at the fans for weeks now, and lately started sarcastically applauding them when they get on his back. Moreover, he's been one of our worst managers in modern times with a win ratio of 37.84% while playing dire football throughout. The fact that Leeds have still been so close to the Play-Offs for so long, with little semblance of putting a promising run together, just shows how mediocre teams really are in this league.

Fair enough, this summer he simply didn't get the funds that he no doubt expected, but for a manager who advocated quality over quantity, he hasn't half brought a load of dead weight into the club. Varney, Austin, Norris, Green: not one of them can pass the ball between them. The only midfielder we have who's capable of passing the ball is Tonge, whom Warnock hasn't even bothered to play since he signed him permanently. He says that they're all lads he'd want in the trenches with him, but that's where they belong. What separates footballers worthy of Leeds United from the average player on a sunday is entertainment value: the ability to 'wow' a crowd, and I don't think that any of them can do that with any consistency.

The worst part is that Warnock is just so full of shit. It's never his fault, nor is it the fault of any of his signings. He said last season that we would have ""pace and power"" in time for this season, well I've seen no pace in the departments you look for it to be in, and the power just got sold off to Norwich. I especially like how he sold one of the highest scorers we've seen at the club, then two games later starts moaning about how his side can't score goals - that's a really nice touch. He also claimed that we would have width, and yet he's hardly used any genuine wide players, choosing instead to play central midfielders on the wing. I'm still laughing at his ""Varney is our new Snodgrass"" comment, by the way. Chris Burke would have been a tremendous signing for the club, but he refused to sign a player with twice the ability of Peltier for around (probably less than) the same price.

I haven't even touched on his tactics yet. 4-4-1-1, 4-4-2, 3-5-2; Aidy White on the right wing and Lee Peltier at left back. For the former, I really dislike how he can't decide the same formation, let alone the same team (his chopping and changing has really hurt our consistency), and as for the latter it just demonstrates how baffling his policy of square pegs in round holes really is. Another incredible predictable - and boring - strategy of his is to leave his substitutions until we go a goal down. Seriously, the number of times that it happens is maddening and only goes to show that he makes his mind up by the time it's too late to change anything.

Phil Hay tweeted during the 'Boro game that it was looking like substitutions would win the game for either team. Guess who made a sub before the winning goal and who made their first substitute afterwards. It's pathetic - and the same story could be seen during the Wolves game. It's not the player's fault for not scoring enough or conceding late on: it's his fault for not being proactive during a game.

For me, Warnock's managerial stint at the club is reminiscent of a corpse waiting to be tagged and bagged at the morgue.

If secure erase was impossible digital forensic analysts would have to use a brand new hard drive every time they wanted to store a copy of any digital evidence, as the hard drives previous contents would conflict with the physical searching(physical as in the first layer of the OSI model, don't get confused here) of the drive. This of course would conflict with the [ACPO guidelines principle 1](http://www.7safe.com/electronic_evidence/ACPO_guidelines_computer_evidence.pdf) and make the evidence invalid in court.

What they actually do is use a program called [dban](http://www.dban.org/) to scrub the whole thing. They could simply run this on the hard drives and hand the computers back.

Stole the lives and opportunities of all those people and he gets ht opportunity to go free... okay, me going on about that bvious injustice seems to get reddit's back up, so let's look at the logistics:

They let him go. They give him a new identity. He probably has to have some kind of facial reconstructive surgery or something because people will be hunting him, and will anticipate the justice system trying to hide his identity, so they will likely have to take extreme precautions to keep him safe. They are reasonably certain that he is rehabilitated (as certain as you can be without physically being the person, for argument's sake).

The chances of him relapsing into his previous ways, and the chances of someone finding him, will never be lower than if they just leave him in prison...

Okay I'm starting to see some sense in all this now, but they wouldn't even have to leave him in a standard prison. It could just be house arrest in a secure location that nobody knows about, such that he doens't share his life with others, but is still not free. But even then that would be effort... Do you really think murderers and rapists would 'see the light' (i.e. become normal civilised people?).

Truth be told, I don't know much abotu the issue, I'm just stating my opinions. But people are fucking *stubborn*. I bet these same debates were being had when this muder first happened 20 years ago. Ideas take a long time to die evidently, and I bet there's a lot of people who, depite all the debate, may well be steadfast in their opinions on the matter. What if the same applies to those who are incarcerated? What if they don't possess any sense of empathy or ethics beyond their own well-being, in the same way a child might...

&gt; a child

Okay I'm having a bit of a revelation in my own mind about all this now, wow. They *were* children. I guess they only avoided doing bad things because they would get in trouble if they got caught, rather than because their actions might hurt others and they wouldn't want that to happen to them... just like how most kids thing.

Okay fine, in conclusion to all this, I concede that the mudering children should well be treated differently to adults (to be fair I never stated that I didn't agree with this, it seems it was assumed due to my stance), and I can see hope for their rehabilitation though. But I'm still raising an eyebrow to the issue of adult rehabilitation. I suppose it would be effective but if 1% of all those 'rehabilitated' relapse, and 50% of those 1% cause serious harm or damage before they are subdued. Would it still be worth it? Where do we draw the line?

Also I still don't think Venables can be rehabilitated. I do agree now, though, that they should have tried, but it doens't look like it's worked.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Looking at Amy at the beginning of series 5 contrasted with Power of Three (10 years into marriage) is huuuuge.

I agree that the difference is huge, but viewers didn't share in the experience of her arriving at that difference. Moffat rushed her development in the biggest way by just pushing us into seeing future snippets of her life after she changed, not while she was evolving as a person. *Amy's Choice* is the closest thing to seeing her evolve, but after the issue was supposedly settled, we saw her old behavior resurface.

I do not like seeing an established character remade into a new version of that character with the excuse of, ""Well, there's a lot of traveling in the TARDIS and experiences we don't see in the show."" Bullshit! This is storytelling, and it's lazy storytelling to skip the important parts. 

Yeah, you can probably guess I didn't like the Doctor's marked change to I'm-not-helping-anyone-anymore stance in *The Snowmen*. This change is supposedly not so drastic if you watch the season's episodes in a different order than they were broadcast, which just pisses me off more because 99% of viewers won't be doing that, and so it just makes the show that much more nonsensical.

The fibre connected to each house goes back to a hubbing site, where the data then jumps onto a ring around the county, and then backhauls back to Telecity in Manchester. Apparently, they have peering arrangements in place so high-demand stuff such as Youtube, iPlayer, etc. is peered in Manchester to reduce network usage charges for this mini-telecommunication firm. Peering in this sense is where a lot of the frequently accessed videos from Youtube (for example) are copied closer to the end user, to stop them accessing expensive trans-Atlantic routes.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"What the operating system tracks isn't really the point. If the operating system marked a block bad (which virtually never happens any more), you still have access to that block and can still securely erase it. The operating system won't use that block for file data, but that's just the filesystem layer. Plenty of utility software works at a lower level than that, accessing sector data directly.

The really sneaky data is hidden by the device, which shuffles blocks around itself. Check the SMART information for the drive to see how often this has happened - if more than a few blocks have moved, it's probably time to replace the drive. This is why operating systems rarely mark hard disk blocks bad - if it's necessary, these days the hard drive handles it before the O/S even knows there's a problem.

What this means is that the possibility of that theoretically recoverable little fragment of data existing is much harder to eliminate than if the O/S were in control, but it's even more impossible (sorry) to exploit.

Also, last time I checked the standard sector size was 512 bytes (one half of a kilobyte). Operating systems often group some number of sectors together and call each group a ""cluster"", but as the hard drive is swapping the sectors, it's really the 512 byte sector that's important here.

As a guide to how much image data that is, a Commodore 64 160x200 4-colour mode pixel bitmap screen required roughly 9 kilobytes of memory. 1K ""colour map"" memory indicated for each 4x8 pixel ""character"" cell what the two ""extra"" colours were, plus 8K for the bitmap itself, and you could actually have a grand total of 16 colours on screen (with some restrictions).

So - 18 hard disk sectors gives you something like [this - I'd better say NSFW](http://www.lemon64.com/games/screenshots/ext_full/sex_games_02.gif) - image from [http://www.lemon64.com/](http://www.lemon64.com/).

They were not really of an age to be criminally responsible, but they were dragged through the adult court system because of the power of the press.  They would not have a criminal trial in many other countires.  Their names and pictures were released after the trial, which made it impossible for them to be rehabilitated.

Essentially it was a judicial lynching of two young and damaged children.  There were alternatives which would not have seen them come out of the criminal justice system earlier, but they would have kept anonymity and there would be the possibility that they could be rehabilitated.  I would be very dubious of any reports about the lack of remorse.  The only professionals who would know this would not talk to the press.

Quote from wikipedia with my emphases added.

&gt; Up to **five hundred protesters** gathered at South Sefton Magistrates' Court during the boys' initial court appearances. The parents of the accused were moved to different parts of the country and assumed new identities following **death threats** from vigilantes.

&gt;The full trial opened at Preston Crown Court on 1 November 1993, conducted as an **adult trial** with the accused **in the dock away from their parents**, and the judge and court officials in legal regalia.  The boys denied the charges of murder, abduction and attempted abduction brought against them. The attempted abduction charge related to an incident at the New Strand Shopping Centre earlier on 12 February 1993, the day of Bulger's death. Thompson and Venables had attempted to lead away another two-year-old boy, but had been prevented by the boy's mother. Each boy sat in view of the court on raised chairs (so they could see out of the dock designed for adults) accompanied by two social workers. Although they were separated from their parents, they were within touching distance when their families attended the trial. News stories reported the demeanour of the defendants. **These aspects were later criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 1999 that they had not received a fair trial by being tried in public in an adult court.**

* I don't know what kind of sleep these boys got or what they drank last night, but they all looked (exception being Marin) like they were hungover.

* Ramires continues to disappoint me. He gave the ball away in crucial areas on several occasions. Had we been playing a Real Madrid or Manchester United, we would have been in deep(er) shit.

* Where the heck was Mata? I swear he was completely invisible. I honestly didn't even realize he was playing until he was subbed off. I'm not sure what has changed in recent games with the Little Spaniard, but he needs to snap out of it and play like a genius again.

* Lampard did alright but started shooting wildly from crazy positions. I think his proximity to being the record scorer for CFC is starting to get to him. He needs to settle down and play brilliant football; if goal opportunities present themselves, great, but he needs to stop trying to force them.

* Everyone else performed pretty much below average with no crucial mistakes, for which I'm thankful.

* I really don't understand why Bertrand got the start over Ashley Cole. In a game where we need to press forward and score a vital away goal AND be able to defend, Bertrand is pretty much the last guy I'd pick. I don't know what his proper position is supposed to be, but he's been dead weight as far as I'm concerned.

* On a similar note, I'm glad Marin got the nod to start but leaving out Oscar was very strange. Again, this kid has proven he can score goals in European competitions. When we need to score away goals and we don't start our most prolific guy (for Euro competitions), I seriously question our leadership.

- The emphasis is on fast pressing.
- Lowest number of crosses in the league compared to last's when it was one of the highest.
- Very rarely do they play the long ball.

This means that the data (in this case, images of child pornography), or fragments of it, could quite easily still be present on the disk in currently unused sectors and slack space. Also, it might be still existing in the page file or hibernation file. Maybe in cached thumbnail data too.
And this is just on the filesystem and operating system level. The internal workings of the disk present another layer of complexity with sector remapping and suchlike.

However I had been waiting for the BBC iPlayer to be released on it.
It seems in the last AppleTV update TV programme coverage has been extended, and current BBC material is far more prominent.
Sherlock's ""Study in Pink"" was one of the 12 days of Christmas give aways; fair enough I thought since it was shown a few years ago.

Now though there are a lot more  current programmes you'll have to pay a lot of money to see. My understanding was the BBC was using new technology to deliver programmes. This just seems to be yet another way to fleece people; pardon the cliché.
I no longer watch broadcast TV just view it over the internet on my Sony Blu Ray player, which can't remember where I was when I restart, is slow.
Why should we pay £120, and be charged to see the content? With Apple's 30% tax, this hasn't been announced by the BBC, I imagine so they can see if they can get away with it. Angry people complaining might make them realise **NO!**

true,badspyro,null,null,"OK, here goes an explanation:

 - Sainsburys are doing a promotion where if your 'branded' items (heinz beans, HP sauce, Monster Energy) cost more when you shop with them, you get a voucher for the difference (that is only redeemable at Sainsburys natch)

 - However, Sainsburys work it out as such:

     (BrandedItemBought1+BrandedItemBought2+etc.)

 Minus

  (BrandedItemTescoPrice1+BrandedItemAsdaPrice2+etc.)

 equals voucher amount

 - Effectively this means that the voucher price is an average of the price difference multiplied by the number of branded items

What Bencoder was suggesting, however, was a method of beating the average by putting branded items that are on 'offer' i.e. 2 for the price of 1 on 2l coke bottles through on a separate receipt as they are almost guaranteed to mess up the average and reduce the amount of your voucher (although, in reality, a significant number of the big brand deals are cross-store, so this may, or may not have a sizeable difference).

In reality, the vast majority of what a supermarket stocks, and what you buy is 'un-branded', and with Sainsbury's pricing being what it is, it's likely that a shop at this supermarket will cost you more than at another.

Effectively, this brand deal (which is similar to the price promise at Waitrose on branded food) is a cheep way to get customers in, as the price promises are effectively price fixing the items that all supermarkets purchase at a similar unit cost for a relatively small number of items, allowing them to push the price up on own-branded items while sounding competitive.

As such, take any of these systems with a pinch of salt, as the systems are all monitored to make sure that they don't loose money - it's the same rules as a casino...

In every aspect of their life, except one, they *are* ""normal"", by local social standards. They have jobs, houses, social lives, eat, sleep, crap, etc. just the same as anyone else. Being a paedophile doesn't automatically make them grow an unkempt beard, wear trench-coats, and buy big round stereotypical child-molester glasses. They do the same shit that everyone else does, because they are a person.

In fact, if you think about it from an entirely amoral point of view (i.e. analysis without considering moral value) they have a sexual paraphilia like any other. What, in purely scientific terms, makes them any different from or any stranger than a person that is sexually attracted to elderly people, obese people, plastic dolls, or cars? Nothing at all, really.

A person's sexual preferences are not necessarily tied into any other part of their persona or life. Just because someone is into submissive sexual relationships doesn't mean they're submissive in everything they do. Just because someone is into whips and chains in the bedroom doesn't mean they wear their ball-gag to work. Just because someone is a paedophile does not mean they'll suddenly start acting in a manner stereotypical of paedophiles during non-sexual parts of their life.

Obviously our society does pose a hefty weight of immorality against such people (with good reason, imo) but it's silly to think that these people don't exist in significant numbers or always exhibit obvious behavioural patterns that render them visibly abnormal in some way.

If you're looking for the worst part, and I mean *the real worst part*, it's that we're not enlightened enough as a species to recognise damaging paraphilias as a mental condition that can be treated. Chucking these people in prison *after* they've irrevocably damaged some poor kid's life is absolutely not a solution. The solution is to get them help *before* they cause harm, by removing the demonisation of such mental health issues and providing a structure under which such people can be identified and, for lack of a better word, normalised.

For every aspect of their life, except one, they're just a normal person going about their every day life.  Complaining that we can't find them is like complaining that you can't spot the guy who works as an insurance salesman out of a crowd of three hundred people wearing suits.

If you want to be really paranoid, consider the vast quantities of them you can find in online chatrooms, on Omegle / Chat Roulette / Stickam, on 4chan, on Tor sites, etc. Think about the number of celebrity kiddy porn busts that make the news each year. Do you *really* think they're particularly uncommon in day-to-day real life, too? I honestly would not be surprised if someone you know or frequently interact with is one.

As much as we'd like to pretend otherwise, they *do* exist, and they *aren't* uncommon. And that clearly means that our current protection framework isn't working.",0,1360897718,null,0,false,0,c8fhi55,t3_18jssw,t1_c8fhi55,t1_c8fgtfs,null,1431298687,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Think about it - if these people don't look abnormal, and aren't acting excessively abnormally (e.g. shouting in the street) you generally wouldn't even consider it. If they're walking down the road and look at a kid, most people would assume they're looking at the kid for a benign reason. It's an Occam's Razor scenario - you assume the commonplace and benign before the unusual and malicious. They'd have to be pretty lecherous before I even registered that something was wrong.

The first things I'm going to think are:

 - That guy is looking at a kid. Ok then.
 - That guy has been looking at that kid for a while. Maybe it's his kid.
 - Ok, it's not his kid. Maybe he's just thinking ""heh, that kid is funny"", or he's distracted by the noise it's making.
 - Hmm, ok, he's still looking. Maybe it reminds him of his own kid or something.

He's going to have to stare at that kid for a while before I think anything is wrong, and by that point I'll probably have lost interest and moved along.

Quality writing is also something worth waiting for. I enjoy not being able to see a formulaic plot coming from a mile away. All in all, I am looking forward to the next eight episodes and everything else they are trying so hard to keep secret. I don't want it spoiled. Lets give them a break.

true,gsuberland,null,null,"Interesting. This actually gives us some insight into what's going on.

I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the law contains a pair of clauses called *autrefois acquit* and *autrefois convict*, which are more commonly known as the double jeopardy clause.

Before the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was enacted, everyone was protected against being charged for the same crime again under these clauses. Once acquitted or convicted of a crime, you may not be charged with that same crime again.

The only exceptions to this clause were appeals, i.e. an objection to the application of law by the defendant or prosecution, and tainted acquittals, i.e. a second trial issued after the discovery of perversion of the trial process. CJA 2003 introduced additional exceptions which allow for any serious crime (rape included) to undergo a secondary trial when new and compelling evidence comes to light, as long as the Court of Appeal agrees to quash the original aquittal.

This means we're left with four possible scenarios:

 * He wasn't charged the first time around, since the CPS didn't have enough evidence, and they're now officially charging him because new evidence has come to light. This avoids the *autrefois acquit* clause entirely.
 * He was charged the first time, then acquitted, and the new exceptions in CJA 2003 have been applied to allow for a second trial due to overwhelming new evidence.
 * There was a mistrial. Doubtful, since you'd think we'd have heard about it by now.
 * He is being charged with a different crime, and he remains acquitted of the old crime.",0,1360900327,null,0,false,0,c8fiad9,t3_18jssw,t1_c8fiad9,t1_c8fhcb5,null,1431299062,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Fine. With you so far. 

&gt;If a patient genuinely believes in homepathy, and has an illness that can be effectively treated by placebo, then I don't see why it shouldn't be offered.

Because it doesn't fucking work. If it's the same as a placebo, give them sugar pills, or water. 

Alternatively, treat them like an adult, tell them they're being stupid, and that they can either use real medicine, or go buy their own bunch of cloves, or extremely diluted solutions.

If the writers involved are good and could deal with the kinds of scenarios which would play out, it could be very worthwhile. With such a situation, it could be interesting as a once-in-a-while occurrance for a female Doctor to try to be in control (as normal) and finds herself hitting the glass ceiling. Or maybe in an episode, have her fumble around tiredly or being more irritable than normal (minor nod to the monthly demon). Like normal companion shenanigans happen, female Doctor goes out for revenge... PMS-level irritability/aggression on top of her being the Oncoming Storm... I think that is now my nightmare fuel.

Another worry is if the Doctor regens into a woman, the female Doctor may devolve to ""shoes! Men! Shopping!"" mode like many female characters in so many shows are stuck in.

true,safaridiscoclub,cnty-england,Reading / Gt. Yarmouth,"I'll ask another question. When did it become a criminal offence to monitor your workers' productivity?

That's what managers are supposed to do, just because Amazon do it more efficiently and accurately than ever before people are now taking offence. Supermarkets monitor you, 17 items a minute is what you're supposed to hit at Sainsbury's, if you don't, you'll be reminded. Truck drivers are constantly monitored through GPS, bus drivers too, are supposed to keep time to the minute. I also don't see the problem of having to pass through scanners every day, if you've got nothing to hide then it shouldn't be an issue.

The author of the article talks about deserving the wage they're on. £6 an hour is probably near enough what these people are worth to Amazon, we won't know because they're not allowed to pay them any less. It's the going rate for unskilled staff and automating the process means that you'll get less errors. The sigma six supply chain system suggests that you aim for 3.4 errors per every million products made, that does not happen without automation.

Also, this:
&gt;workers routinely scoring 110% are reported to be sweating quite hard for most of the day.

God forbid you work up a sweat at work! Let alone that there is nothing to substantiate her claim.

Amazon just seem to be victimised a lot lately for practices which aren't particularly uncommon. People who don't own business will moan that the workers are treated like robots etc. but if they had a business to run they would want it run in the most efficient manner. The Amazon warehouse is nine football pitches big, the computers track the location of every item and use an algorithm to suggest a route for the staff. The algorithm is literally the quickest way of them getting there, so why leave it to their own judgement?

""I skimed down it - and it is very heavily cherry picked to pitch one scaremongering vision that is frankly not going to happen based on a political bias that is so obviously leaning in one direction that I am surprised it doesn't fall over.

1. The sources are not heavily cherry picked. They are from a range of journals, national newspapers (guardian/telegraph) and primary sources.
2. The title of the blogpost is accurate.
3. Political bias? I'm not a member or voter/supporter of any political party and my views are my own, and evidenced. I take on Labour.Lib Dem and Tory in the piece as all neoliberal parties.
4. To say that 'for the consumer of the service nothing will change' is laughable.  Why would the biggest reorganisation of the NHS since its inception (in the words of Lansley) take place if there were to be no impact on the consumer?  Ofcourse there's going to be a change.  My argument is that is it not a positive change.  I'm arguing that the change is economically illiterate, has already resulted in big and costly mistakes (in lives and money) and these failures are being pinned on the public nature of the service rather than the privatisations.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"But this isn't actually the experience of cooperatives.  Indeed the pool of talent is far far broader and deeper than the beneficiaries of current capitalist system want you to believe.  Imagine, if you will, a football stadium full of doctors or lawyers or CEOs at the turn of the 20th century.  Got them pictured in your mind's eye?  Right, how many women are there?  That's right, none, near as damn it.  Is that because women aren't capable of becoming doctors, lawyers and CEOs?  I would hope that you'd recognise that it isn't.  And yet, that's what almost all of the men and indeed most of the women at the time would have said.  Their capabilities, competencies and expectations were very much limited to the domestic sphere because of the rampant sexism of the education system, the professions and public life, and would have remained so were it not for revolutionary changes to these.  Today, you'd expect to see a large proportion of that stadium as female, and it's not because women have sudden become more intelligent, but that the talent pool was already there and the barriers to entry were removed (or at least lessened).  Today, that scenario is repeated but the defining factor is class, and your position above is a classist one.  

I was listening to a case recently relating to one of those corporations taken over by their workers in Argentina after the capitalists deserted during its sovereign debt crisis and default.  The woman who ""took over"" the CFO role in what is now a very successful workers' coop was one of the cleaners or similar, and she was asked what the most difficult aspect of fulfilling her role had been - was it double entry bookkeeping, managing investments, determining corporate financial strategy?  Nope, you know what it was?  Learning to read.

Whilst the John Lewis style cooperative is a definite step above the usual run-of-the-mill capitalist corporation, it isn't a genuine workers' coop, principally _because_ it has a hierarchical structure, and maintains the managerial class.  What soon happens in these sort of setups is that the mass attendance at company meetings becomes progressively less well attended by those who are marginalised from accessing information and knowledge about the management and decision-making further up the system.  If you look at the higher level committees in JLP, they are increasingly attended by a higher and higher proportion of those from managerial backgrounds, and they become almost indistinguishable in the final analysis from a standard corporation.  Employee share ownership schemes are similar, because ownership does not have a huge amount to do with control, except for the elite who own the vast majority of the shares.  In fact, there can be a dangerous sense of double jeopardy since a worker's eggs are proportionately more contained within a single basket.

So yes, you cherry picked. In fact, unless you link to everything, it is impossible not to cherry pick.

But my contention which you are still ignoring is that the core principle of the NHS -- care free at the point of need -- will be unchanged.

Now you can argue whether you prefer an old-fashioned single monolithic organisation or something more suited to the 21st century as a provider of care - but so long as the underlying principle remains intact, then your contention that the NHS ""as we know it"" will cease is laughable.

The NHS as the staff know it will change, but the  NHS as the rest of the population of the UK know it wont change.

So, yes, your headline was wrong, and yes, you are still refusing to explain how the NHS will cease to be a provider of medical care funded by general taxation and free at the point of use from the end of April.

 - When that doesn't work the bailiffs essentially run out of toys    
 - The two guys spend 20 minutes calling the bailiffs ""criminals"" to the police

 - The police decide that without additional paperwork the bailiffs cannot physically remove the two guys (but that their current paperwork would have been lawful to simply evict them)

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; The fact that she lied about being on the phone is in itself a crime, no?    

That's a fair point.    

I just did some research on that. Firstly the answer is ""extremely complicated."" Which is to say that it involves Common Law, a dozen different statues, and case law stretching back at LEAST to 1900.    

From what I can tell: Lying to the police IS a crime. However it is a very minor crime. Because she didn't ""fabricate evidence,"" she didn't repeat her lie when later questioned, and there was no planning or premeditation to lie it is reduced.    

She also didn't lie in court.   

So I think they could find something to slap on her for lying. But ultimately we're not talking about years in prison even in that situation. We're talking about at worst case scenario weeks (or nothing).   

She could also easily claim she ""didn't understand the question"" at the roadside which is a fairly easy sell when she has just been involved in what I would describe as a major accident.    

The police ask her ""were you using your mobile phone?"" She could have thought they meant ""were you **holding** your mobile phone?"" It wouldn't take too much to convince a jury of that...

But now everyone wants to live in Camden. 

Following on from that logic, it is ok to bump the poor people out of any area when the rich move in. Because, y'know, the area suddenly became desirable. Bit like Israel really.

Without wanting to just quote different parts and respond to them in an ugly way, I'll say that the argument that welfare needs to be cut is absurd.  Welfare is the one item of government spending that needs to *rise* when times are tough.  People are more vulnerable during those times, particularly those who are already on welfare or pensions, and more people are relying on that welfare because more people are out of work.  Cutting welfare only makes vulnerable people more vulnerable.

Besides, most of the article fails to ask a fundamental question regarding public finances; is there really a crisis?  The current debt rise is really [nothing more than a historical blip](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1940_2015UKp_12c1li001lcn_F0t40tG0t).  It's certainly a big blip, but that doesn't mean that we have a crisis.  In addition, ~~neither welfare spending nor~~ total public spending is not out of control, having remained relatively stable since the 1950s, when we were also rapidly paying down wartime debt that peaked at over 200% of GDP.

Now, there is an argument that says we should shift towards more private and less public provision (not one that I agree with, but it does exist), but that is a completely different debate.  The argument that we need to implement austerity *as a response to an immediate crisis* is certainly not supported by the historical financial evidence.

As said by others the money in our pocket is worth less than it was 5 years ago.  Who has had a pay rise in line with inflation every year?
A short term boost to the high street could be achieved through a cut in VAT but I don't think this would solve the issues.  Although having the full rate of VAT on home improvements is an issue. 
There is only so much ""stuff"" we can buy.  We've replaced out CRT TVs with flat screens giving us a few extra inches and 3D won't make us rush out and buy more.  We are all making our possessions last longer.  And most of us wait till there is a sale on till we spend our cash. 
Unless you increase the amount of money that can be spent by increasing the amount of people earning you can't increase retail sales significantly. Not sure that sentence was very well constructed. 
But the increase in living costs combined with pay increases below inflation means less money to be spent on other things.  Increasing wages or tax cuts would be artificial, get a million people back in work and that would do it.
But that is a major issue.  The profile of a successful business now often means smaller companies so a great tech company might have 1/10 the staff of a traditional company of the same turn over. 
If it were easy then I'm sure the politicians would have sorted it by now. Ok not sure about that.

true,InsufferableTwat,null,null,"We need to think about concept of ""deserving"" a particular rate of pay. It's central to this discussion - the article talks about workers ""deserving"" a certain rate, and the perverted extreme of this is the idea that people like asylum seekers should be restricted in what they spend their (precious little) money on. 

It's probably human nature to think of it in ""deserving"" terms. When I was a manual worker out in all weathers, I remember thinking I was much more deserving of my money, than the cosseted managers and paper-pushers. Now I'm a bit older and have more experience and ""responsibility"" I feel like I deserve renumeration that reflects it. 

But it's bollocks, because - as always - we should be talking about reality. And reality is that pay rates (notwithstanding statutory minimums) are set by the wonderful, nebulous, imaginary concepts that are ""markets"". And working conditions - in big, profit-maximising firms at least - are the result of systems which design other systems.

""Deserving"" only describes what *we imagine* we're worth. It has nothing to do with what a mindless, unconscious and unconscionable economy ""decides""(!) we're worth.

I don't like it either. In fact I hate it, it's alienating and horrible. But arguing for pay that ""you deserve"" is like arguing with the weather, for all our impassioned pleas are likely to make any difference.

When I was at university in Huddersfield I had saved up £3000 from working at Woolworths while in college, and then worked at McDonalds a little bit while at Uni (I eventually gave up as it was really quite a horrible job and I was getting £2 an hour less than I was at Woolworths).

That initial amount meant I had, what, maybe £10000 for that first year, and that first year I lived, in student terms, like a King. I bought myself an entirely new computer, laptop, iphone, all sorts - and because I was renting (a private house, not one of those extortionate houses ""for students"" where you rent a room with others renting rooms) with 2 friends from college, we managed to find somewhere that was only about £10 a month more expensive than the halls of residence, but that meant we could get better internet, and we had much more room for the three of us.

We used to go out all the time, and we'd order in a lot too. My friends had also done the same as me and managed to save up some money, one of them got a car, and we were sorted, we really were not living on a remotely tight budget.

My next years were not quite as mad as the first, but it would still be that by the time the next installment of the student loan was due through, I would still have a few hundred pounds left, and our lifestyle didn't change all that much.

true,Raskilinov,null,null,"Poltico from what I've read of your blog, it broadly covers three distinct areas:
1) PFIs, 2) a paragraph on the abolition of PCTs and SHAs and 3) private organisations taking over hospitals. 

I'm broadly aware of PFIs but do not feel that I know enough on the topic without further research to comment.

Abolition of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs).
This commissioning responsibility will transfer to Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). These CCGs in comparison to PCTs/SHAs will have a lesser management layer within them as the leadership is provided by clinical leaders, i.e. GPs of the localities. Does it remove economies of scale - not really. Does it denationalise the service? No. 

CCGs will still carry a responsibility to provide health provision for their area. NHS Commissioning Board will also carry responsibility for commissioning and for the authorisation of CCGs. http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_134569.pdf

Authorisation is the the green light to allow CCGs to commissioning health services for their areas. 
http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/resources/resources-for-ccgs/auth/ccg-auth-facts/

Both these bodies (CCGs and NHSCB) will cover the England footprint and report to DH. The heirachy for government organisations to provide a health service, has been reduced such that provision of healthcare has less red tape to travel before it is implemented at the local level. 

Surrey PCT was not bought by Assura (Virgin). The PCT is a governmental body to allow the DH to manage and distribute the health budget across NHS England. SHAs act as regional advisory bodies often providing managerial and advisory support for multiple PCTs. 
The service providers (e.g. hospitals, dental providers, community service) that as paid for by Surrey PCT was bought by Assura. 
What this does is reduce the amount of competition providers face within the Surrey footprint when competing for contracts. Additionally this reduces the incentive for providers to improve on their services. 
To overcome lesser service competition; the contract management within Surrey will need to become smarter to ensure service contracts will stretch providers when competition is low. 


Amendments - START

May you please correct your post to clarify the following:
The Secretary of State for Health will retain ministerial responsibility for the provision of the health service within England. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2010-2012/0321/2012321.pdf
So in your terms ""there will be democratic responsibility at the heart of our government"".

""The Primary Care Trust was facing a £650m takeover bid by Virgin Care.""
This sentence (preferably the paragraph) needs to be amended to clarify that the service providers operating in the PCT's footprint were bought, and not the PCT itself. Your original statement is misleading and more worryingly spreads disinformation amongst readers.

&gt; Wireless radio-frequency equipment and a vehicle fleet bristling with real-time tracking and communications capability have been two key solutions. 

&gt;Eddie Stobart has always been prepared to invest in the latest technology. It fits telematics systems in most of its fleets, and is a core provider of real-time data to ITIS Holdings' traffic reporting system. All the company's vehicles are equipped with tracking systems that allow ITIS to monitor the actual speed the vehicles are travelling at in real-time. The data is one component used by ITIS is developing its real time traffic information services.

&gt;Stobart uses ITIS's sister-company Navtrack to analyse its own fleet movements. Vehicles are linked to their base via satellite, radio and in-cab telephone, and this package allows planners to track a vehicle, re-route if necessary, and provide the customer with status reports in real time.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"Rodgers has a three year contract, he has *three years* to turn things around and it wasn't going to happen in one.

&gt;Because of the way we have been performing lately. We were playing really bad. Not just bad, really bad.Especially the game vs Zenit. They looked like they just learned how to play soccer. Even the seniors were doing bad. 

The result was terrible, not so much the overall performance, and the comment about them looking like they just learned how to play football is baffling. It reminded of the Arsenal performance, we soaked up the pressure from a team playing very well who were putting us on the back foot, the main difference being that the chances we took in the Arsenal match, we scored, whereas in this match we didn't (Suarez missed a couple of chances, is that Rodgers fault?) We were away in Russia against a tough team, it was never going to be easy. What I can fault though is some heartless performances from players, but that's another issue. 

Instead of looking at the past two performances, look at it on a broader scale and look what he's done since he's come here, he's blooded in young players into the squad while signing a few others, has the team playing better football, got rid of the deadwood players on big contracts, got the likes of Downing, Enrique and Henderson performing and has enough trust from the key players that they were happy to sign new contracts. Our forward line has been improved and the defence is going to be next. Look at the potential in the younger players in the squad, they're adapting to Rodgers system and next year will be much better players. 

Has it been a perfect season and should he get away without any criticism, no, there's plenty to criticise him over, he's made some tactical errors, odd substitutions and said some silly things in the media. It's his first season at a major club and he's trying to instill a new philosophy, he's made mistakes, every manager does. And remember, the players should be shouldering the blame with the manager, too many players don't have the heart or determination to change things around and that's something that's hard to train.

Next season is the one to judge him by, there was too much building to be done this season and it was evident all the way back to the day he signed for the club. He has a vision about how he wants his football to be played and the direction the team will go in, same can't be said about the last two managers. If things are the same next season, then by all means lose belief.

This isn't 2009 and we're one of the top teams in Europe and challenging for the title, supporters need to get out of that frame of mind, we've regressed, we have to try build up once again to hopefully get back to that point.

I'm not saying that you should be overly optimistic, blindly follow the man and exempt him from any criticism, but to say you're losing belief in what he says after losing two matches is kneejerk. There's a huge task ahead and a crucial component is time, some people need to realise that.

I've helped a few people out on this sub reddit, either with my own ticket or by putting people in touch with others. However, mine and my friends tickets are season tickets, which we have invested a reasonable sum of money in and are subject to Chelsea's terms and conditions.
They can be withdrawn by the club with little chance of appeal.

Therefore when a person who's name I don't recognise asks for a ticket, I'm only being cautious and protecting myself (and anyone else in a similar position) by checking a posting history to ensure that person isn't an opposition fan who could cause trouble or problems by sitting in a Chelsea seat.

Actually they pretty much are. An author is only granted a limited term monopoly on the right to produce *copies* of the book which after which the book enters it's legally natural state in the public domain. 

Of course people like this guy think that we should simply grant them that state backed monopoly as a natural right because they've confused laws that where created for the public good (incentive the creation of new work that will pass in to the public domain by granting a short term right to profit from that work) for one that is about their individual rights. Which is purely a view pushed by publishers who are using to make money... which is why copyright terms can expand past the death of the creator because those rights can be passed to companies which *don't die*. 

There's some stunning new research that shows that expanding copyright terms comes with higher prices for the public which when coupled with the fact that we've lost decades of work that should now be in the public domain but which have been locked up by publishers should make you question why we are simply handing more and more rights that where intended as a means to an end at the expense of the ends.

For those who don't know, a trans-person is someone who is born into the wrong body in terms of their physical sex. This is an established medical concern in this country and is why we provide treatment and surgery for such people on the NHS. Recent studies have shown that transgender people have significant differences in their brains that would point to their preferred gender rather than their physical one.

She wasn't just taking the piss, she was perpetuating a particularly vile stereotype with no basis in truth. As an outspoken feminist she was enforcing an obsolete gender binary, and acting as the gatekeeper of her particular gender.

And, even if she were just taking the piss, I hardly think that excuses anything, considering the amount of discrimination and difficulty transgender people already have, even without a dried up old feminist hag using a national newspaper as a platform for her obsolete views.

Unfortunately, her opinion of transgender people is not unusual (despite being based as far away from fact and medical reality as it is possible to be) and, it should be noted, that - historically - feminists have been extremely hostile to trans-people, to the extent of working to deny them rights (Stonewall, etc).

true,[deleted],null,null,"From my experience in the prison system I can tell you a few things.

* Firstly:

&gt;*""These guys are lifers - not coming out""*

There are very few actual ""lifers"". In the UK ""life"" means about 20 to 25 years.

* Secondly:

Even if you get a life sentence, there are 4 main categories of prison, and even if you are a lifer if you behave well it's possible to get to category D (open prison such as HMP Ford) and take days out, weekends out and even whole weeks (5 days) out. It's not even that hard to get category D if you behave quite well and do all your courses etc. You can end up spending 2 weeks of each month actually outside the prison at home if you are perfect.

* Thirdly

Basically the reason it's so expensive to keep people in solitary confinement (£80k per year) is that essentially due to humans rights rules and legislations you have to have people who service them all day round. You have to have someone watching them all the time incase they commit suicide (and prison officers aren't cheap), you have to have someone who cooks for them, you have to have someone who brings them their meal, you have to have someone who the takes away their stuff and washes it up, you have to have someone who takes them to chapel / mosque / etc and watches them the whole time *(they have a right to religious worship and trust me, most prisoners exercise that right since you can't get coffee in prison food packs)*, they have the right to 30 mins exercise per day which they also do, and so all these things add up with people needing to monitor them doing it alone 24/7. They also have the right to wash, do laundry etc etc. 

It's much cheaper to try and rehabilitate them, get them onto the courses and see if you can get them to a lower category prison. It only costs £18k per year to keep someone in a Category D open prison such as HMP Ford, which is a hell of a lot cheaper than Category A solitary at £80k+ per year.",0,1360952907,null,0,false,0,c8fryjc,t3_18ktgu,t1_c8fryjc,t1_c8frsnr,null,1431303820,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I wouldn't really want to get into a thread on this again; but I think it is both logical and consistent that civil partnerships already gave gay couples identical (equal) legal rights. 

Correct me if I'm wrong; but AFAIK homosexuals aren't allowed to play music or have religious scripts read during a ceremony for a civil partnership, and religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships. Those are all things that are allowed for hetrosexual marriages. It's clearly discrimination.  
Obviously this thread isn't about Gay marriage so you don't have to discuss it if you don't want to, I'm just pointing this out as one topic where you seem to speak illogically and inconsistantly.

&gt;&gt;we all understand how the Sun makes it's money, nobody is disputing that, why are you bringing it up?

&gt;because it's a storm in a tea cup once again from people who want to bash the Sun.

I think it's a microcosm of the bias that exists amongst some on the left; any horse we can beat should be beaten, regardless of whether it deserves it or not.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Obviously this thread isn't about Gay marriage so you don't have to discuss it if you don't want to, I'm just pointing this out as one topic where you seem to speak illogically and inconsistantly.

And I'm saying I don't see anything illogical or inconsistent in my view; it is just a view different to yours. you raised the legal rights; the legal rights were identical in civil partnerships. They could have a ceremony or blessing in any church that would allow them too; with music and reading or whatever they wanted. You seem to be dangerously close to wanting to force churches who don't recognise gay marriage as marriage to have to perform them. 

I understand that you disagree with me; I'm failing to see how anything I've said is illogical or inconsistent. 

&gt; ""I don't believe there's any logical grounds for such outrage"" contradicts what you said at the start: ""Whilst we can agree the cover was disrespectful and disgraceful,""

perhaps you didn't catch the word 'outrage'. I agree it was disrespectful, I do not agree it warrants such an overblown response. I trust that is simple enough to understand; it's not that I think the Sun did a good thing; it's that I think it is being blown out of all proportion by people who hate the sun, just as people who hate the Guardian will attack it for any non-story that comes along. 

&gt; Why do you claim that you aren't defending The Sun's actions, and that you agree that The Sun has behaved disrespectfully in this instance, but then go on to imply that calling them out on it is an example of ""the left slagging off the right without proper grounds to do so""?

because there is a difference between regarding something as disrespectful or wrong, and 'slagging them off'. The Sun is just doing what it has always done, and it is ridiculous in my view to be particularly alarmed to discover that they would use a picture of an attractive woman to sell a newspaper. 

The great irony of this whole thing is that the Sun knew all too well what they were doing, and likely anticipated the backlash would become a story in itself. They orchestrated the whole thing, and have kept 'the Sun' brand in the spotlight across the national media for a few days, playing everyone like puppets.

true,Booster21,null,null,"Hi, 

I have a couple of notes in making your search more successful (I've been involved at an early stage in startups as a technical cofounder and hired people at them at all stages):

- The salary is very low, as you know. Someone who is hired as a very senior or lead engineer could easily make at least three times this salary in London (if a very senior person is what you're actually looking for!). You need to place more emphasis on the equity you're offering; at that level of salary loss I would expect to be compensated effectively as a cofounder, with the requisite equity levels (plus have assurances about stock dilution etc).
- You need to talk more about the technology and and challenges this person could face: are they going to be creating these 'algorithms' from scratch or just writing a front-end existing technology (for instance)? Are they going to be writing all the code themselves? Are more people going to be actively hired to assist? The scope of the challenge needs to be made more clear.
- Getting involved early in a startup is a risk no mater how you spin it or how great your product is, more so when the product doesn't actually exist yet (correct me if I'm wrong about this). Because of that you need to give people as much information as possible, more specifically on: you and your cofounders, what experience do you have? What skills do you bring to the table?; most importantly, how are you funded? Is the funding at a sustainable level? Have you gone through a seed round? Do you have a plan for moving into further funding rounds? Is the money going to dry up in a few months?

Finding people at this stage of a startup is about trust, you trusting them to do their job really well, and them trusting you to handle the development of the business and the product to make it success and trust needs information.

Now of course we wouldn't kick people out the minute they went on benefits, but we shouldn't be paying indefinitely. There must be a clear limit and it must be restricted. When you reach that time the benefits should stop or you should be moved to a council approved affordable home or whatever.
