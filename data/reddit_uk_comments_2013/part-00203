Is the rest of the UK 100% supporting the Union? So why would they need to be represented by a a UK MP? 

This is about Scotland. This is a vote by Scottish people. Is a UK MP meant to debate with the SNP about how people in Manchester/Birmingham/Cardiff will be affected? Why would that make a difference to how a Scot votes?

The debate is about Scotland, not the UK. What happens to the UK following a split is irrelevant to the debate. That's it's own seperate debate to be had by those who remain.

It kind of is since it's a vote of choosing which government to represent you; Westminster or Holyrood.

&gt;Is the rest of the UK 100% supporting the Union? So why would they need to be represented by a a UK MP? 

You are conflating two different things here.  The NO campaign should  be (and is) led by Scottish politicians (which does include UK MP's such as Darling so I'm not sure what you meant by 'UK MP'? Presumably you meant English MP?).  This is not to say that therefore anyone not living in Scotland has absolutely nothing to contribute to the debate.

To imply that the UK government has nothing to add to a debate about the UK government is, again, simply ludicrous.  Cameron is the prime minister of the Scottish people, if he has a duty to the union then he has a duty to convince the Scottish people that he should continue to lead them.  The NO camp should be falling over themselves to get someone so high profile involved.

You can bet your bottom dollar that were Cameron a popular and skilled debater, and Salmond a puny one, that they would've leapt at the chance to get him involved.

You are correct. I, however, am making an argument in the final presentation that this is the wrong strategy. This is why I am showing solutions with name outside. I am also showing alternate solutions for which crest what does have then name within as well.

For example, [here is version B with name included (and a modular ""detachable"" approach)](http://i.imgur.com/Q6u9iGG.png)

&gt; I like the designs overall however I think the dark blue on light blue would be difficult to see/read when reproduced on a smaller scale.

Again, correct. This is why most of the solutions use a white gutter between the colors. (Not that I think they would take my advice, but) I am making the recommendation that they either slightly darkener and/or lighten their blues for this reason. Not so much that it changes dramatically (or even so much that the average supporter notices), but just enough. A tiny change to both blues would solve this issue.

The National media mentions a tiny fraction of what happens up here in regards to independence so much so that people seem to actually believe that the SNP are a Scottish variant of the BNP and that Alex Salmond is some Hitler-esque creature.

So you'll forgive me if I take offence to this debate being *once again* reduced to a childish understanding of it, It has no basis in reality, It does nothing for the debate except hamper it while people have to yet again explain what has already been explained a million times before, It is an insult to the Intelligence of everyone that thinks giving full power to the Government that hasn't privatised the NHS and has kept our universities available to all could be a bad thing (talking about the Scottish Government here, the reason every time you hear about ""sweeping reforms"" they have to say ""in England"" because Scotland -for the moment- gets to take a different path

true,JackXDark,null,null,"I'm re-quoting myself here, and I've posted about this before, but I think there's a chance they'll have a navalised version of the Typhoon flying from them. 

Here's what I prepared earlier:

There's already a prototype and the Indian Navy is considering a navalised Typhoon, so the work's being done and paid for already.

Because the Typhoon was designed as a dogfighter, with the massive stresses on the airframe that involves, it's almost strong enough anyway. It would need thrust vectoring to handle the landings and the difficult bit there is actually the control software, not the modification itself, but the Typhoon was designed with that as a possible upgrade in mind anyway, so it can already handle thrust vectoring if it's added.

Arrested landings don't need too much strengthening, just a way to anchor the arrestor hook. Without the need for it to be flung forwards with a catapult, there isn't a massive amount of redesigning to do.
Google 'navalised Typhoon' and there's a load of info about it for you to find out more.

The F18 and Rafale are cheaper per unit, but they'd both still need catapults. Which is why, if fitting the new carriers with catapults is cost prohibitive, you've got to stick with the F35B or the navalised Typhoon.

Actually - there is one other alternative to the F35B or a navalised Typhoon, the Saab Grippen.
The RAF has a couple already to train test pilots and for red flag air to air combat training. That's not quite as capable a plane as any of the others, but do fit the requirements better than the Hornet or Rafale for a similar cost.

At the moment I'd put money on the F35B actually sticking it out, with the Typhoon second choice, Grippen third possibility, and the Hornet and Rafale unlikely unless they're offered very cheaply as part of some kind of wider deal.

It's pretty much going to be the F35B. But if that does get cancelled, it'll be the Typhoon and no cats.

But in the meantime, watch for Apaches getting fitted with Harpoon or Sea Eagle missiles and Amraams. That'll probably be the real stopgap measure.",0,1380371583,null,0,false,0,ccgz1cw,t3_1n8z6f,t1_ccgz1cw,t3_1n8z6f,null,1429316246,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0
true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I am feeling strangely optimistic about today, which can't bode well! Millwall have been getting unusually good results, when they're a team who surely can't keep winning, while Leeds have been on a losing streak when they're a team who surely can't keep losing. I think that it's time for the momentum of both teams to shift, so I'm going to predict **2-1 to Leeds**.

Here's the team I think we'll start with:

---------------Kenny

Byram---Wootton---Pearce---Warnock

---------------Austin

Tonge-----------------------Murphy

-------------McCormack

-----Hunt----------------Varney

I don't know why, but I feel that this is a game to continue with a similar team to the one we've been playing in most league games recently. Millwall are typically a team that you can't expect to beat with hoofball tactics, so I think that Hunt and Varney will be good choices with their work rate and movement, in addition to being somewhat able to contest balls in the air.

McDermott has been very protective of Hunt lately: he didn't play him at Elland Road last Saturday when the fans are starting to get on his back, and I think that he didn't involve him at Newcastle because he was unlikely to change the game and it would just be another game where he didn't score to add to the pile. Away at Millwall, however, where we'll need his industry, could be a good place to throw him back in the mix.

However, one player I wouldn't start with (McDermott said he might, but I'm hoping that's just to build up his confidence) is Alex Mowatt. Millwall is the last place you want to give a league debut to a thin, wiry youngster like him. He'll get knocked from pillar to post and I'm not sure that he's developed the guile to deal with it yet, in all honesty. If Peltier is fit then I'd rather he started at right back, as Byram still isn't looking sharp yet, although I would like to see Byram start on the right wing, because that might just help to solve our chronic lack of width.",0,1380371585,null,0,false,0,ccgz1df,t3_1n9tqy,t1_ccgz1df,t3_1n9tqy,null,1429316246,2,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,2

""really terrible performance from chelsea, so devoid of all imagination in attack it's amazing. The amount of times that Mikel/Lampard/Luiz/Ivanovic ended good passages of plays by trying to split the defence from the middle third trying to find torres (both into his runs and also aerially) can hardly be counted on 2 hands. Tottenham have been so-so, they just completely took the foot off the peddle after the goal which is dangerous, but they came out really positively, pressing furiously and really trying to knock it across the ground, Eriksen looks amazing and Townsend looks so silky and is even making a lot of good decisions with the ball. Paulinho so good at making those late-runs into the box has created some problems too.

Chelsea look like full-blown aids and tbh this is just terrible terrible tactics from mourinho. Why in ****s name is ramires on the right ? What was he trying to accomplish there? Would have understood it more if he was setting out to press the life out of tottenham's back-line using Ramires in this regard but they came out and were content to sit back and soak-up pressure from the off. Maybe mourinho just wanted to play out a 0-0, closing space in the def. third and try to steal a goal from a set-piece or counter but this is pathetic strategy with the players that chelsea have at their disposal. Tottenham are really aggressive when chelsea get into their half and are fouling around midfield a lot as a consequence, Hazard is coming inside a lot and because of tottenham aggression is basically being taken out of the game. Oscar has been uninspiring on the ball so far as well, counted 2 terrible passes killing dangerous moves.

Get your **** together mourinho, it's torres up front not drogba. Can't just knock it up there and expect him to come down with it like in the old days.""",0,1380372500,null,0,false,0,ccgz608,t3_1nb122,t1_ccgz608,t3_1nb122,null,1429316187,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Both Scotland and the UK operate a representative democracy; only around 30% of the electorate voted for Cameron, but as Prime Minister he represents all of our interests.

&gt; And, to put it mildly, David Cameron has bigger things to think about than just the Independence question, whereas Salmond is more than happy to completely leverage the entire attention of the Scottish government on it between now and September 2014.
&gt;
&gt; I'd be more inclined to vote for a party that was visibly doing things, rather than harping on about the same single issue, greatly detracting from the proper business of government.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;He argued that for an aluminium smelter to leave the UK and go to another country would not make much difference to climate change. But it would make a ""huge difference"" to those who lost their jobs as a result, he said.

Same principle as before.  If the company leaves, we turn its infrastructure over to the current workers, and they establish a self-directed business and carry on as before, only better.  This is one reason why socialism is inherently greener, when done correctly, because most people don't want to shit on their own doorstep, whereas remotely-owned, traditional corporations want to find the place with the most corrupt and short-sighted regime, with the least genuine democracy, where they can shit as much and as smelly as they like for the cheapest possible price.  This is why capitalism will always be hopelessly inefficient, to the extent of selling the majority of the human race and most likely a large majority of other living things down the river in a relentless quest for growth and profits, as it ruthlessly externalises onto the environment.

And yes, most examples of State ""socialism"" (read State capitalism) have been equally hopeless at protecting the environment, so don't feed me the ""the USSR was worse"" line.

Another story of halves. Awful first half and a great second half. 

Why start Ramires wide? Why can't Mourinho just stick to what works and go from there? Stop experimenting already. 

Weak midfield led to a messy game. Lampard chasing and missing tackles led to the goal. Almost gave up another one a few minutes later. At this point, I really don't know where Lampard should play now. He is such a liability, but he can still score some amazing goals. 

Torres played great today. Aggressive, lively, made some great runs. If only our midfield was better at the first half. 50/50 Call on the red. 
Either unlucky or a bullshit call. Well deserved start. He has been playing well this season, but had to sit back a bit and watch Mourinho play with his new toy.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"Fair result, I agree. We could've nicked a win if not for the completely bizarre red card. Reminds me of the Man Utd game at the Bridge last season - Torres was wrongly given a second yellow for 'diving' when Evans should have been sent off, and we went on to lose the game (to an offside goal), ~~and~~ after having clawed our way back into it.

Great second half, and I don't think we were bad in the first half either - Spurs were just better. Mata looked good when he came on, but still not quite reaching the heights of last season (obviously).

I'm really missing BAE.

 Having said that, excellent response in the second half. Credit to Jose for being proactive and putting Mata in straight away. When Mata came on, we finally looked like a team going forward. Juan was great, besides the assist he was every where distributing good through balls and launching menacing attacks.

Torres worked harder as the game continued and looked like a genuine threat, the best I've seen him play in a while. Vertonghen is such a cunt, diving, shoving, then diving some more. Mike Dean made the wrong decision but I'm fuming more about Vertonghen rolling on the floor 5 minutes after the collision to get Torres sent off.

And why should a general election or especially a referendum be a *popularity contest* between *individuals*. Yes, that is pretty much what politics has become. People vote for their leaders, not parties or policies, but that isn't desirable, and especially shouldn't be desirable for a referendum.

&gt; What are you talking about? The SNP are a political party who achieved power in Scotland through a manifesto pledge of independance. How could party politics not come into play? That's what the whole thing is.

I'm not talking about the SNP. Other forms of party politics will come into play if the leader of the Conservatives is the figure head of the No campaign.

&gt;Personally I think it's a disgrace that the Prime Minister of the UK won't debate the matter with Alex Salmond.

No it isn't. TV debates are not even a British thing. Just because we had one in 2010, it doesn't mean we need to have one all the time. Frankly we managed without TV debates until the 2010 election and we can manage without them now. We especially don't need one for an issue like this (for the reasons above). This was actually a win-win tactical move by Salmond even though he knows TV debates are a rare thing in Britain - if Cameron rejects, he looks like a 'coward', if he accepts, Salmond goes up against an unpopular politician as the 'underdog'.

true,oprahssugardaddy,null,null,"Wasn't thrilled with AVB's substitutions today. I would have liked to see Townsend switched over to the left and have Lamela come on for Sigurdsson. Townsend switching to the left would have given us the width we desperately needed with Rose absent and Lamela could have provided some creativity and perhaps a moment of genius. I like Sigurdsson and what he brings, but he does go missing for long stretches during matches, like today. Great job on the goal though, he seems to pop up at the right times. 


When Mata came on for Mikel and Ramires shifted to the center of the pitch, Chelsea started to take over in the midfield. They had the bulk of the second half possession and honestly looked like the better side until Torres got sent off (undeservedly, imo). Once Mourinho made that switch, AVB should've brought on Sandro for Paulinho (who didn't have his best game). Bringing on Sandro would have stifled Chelsea's midfield play and given Spurs more possession. 


I do like that AVB brought on Defoe for Soldado. Defoe provides a nice change of pace from Soldado, in that he is more selfish and has more pace: great qualities to have for a substitute striker. 


Not too upset with the result, but we could have done better. I think AVB got out-managed today and we were slightly lucky to not concede a second goal, as Chelsea looked the better side in the second half, not to mention the questionable sending off.


Until Rose is back, I think we need to start Townsend on the left. We look lopsided with Sigurdsson out wide and no one to run down the flanks to provide width. Rose's presence plays a bigger role for this team's shape than I thought he would initially, and it is really showing now that he is out. Hopefully he can come back soon.


Once Rose gets back, I would like to see Lamela, Eriksen, and Holtby line up behind Soldado at least once. There has to be a way to accommodate all three of those players...",0,1380381811,null,0,false,0,cch10ml,t3_1nb7az,t1_cch10ml,t3_1nb7az,null,1429315322,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

true,mormengil,null,null,"When Thatcher became Prime Minister, Britain was becoming known as ""The Poor Man"" of Europe.  Since WWII, the British economy had grown more slowly than those of France, Italy, Germany.  Thatcher blamed the socialist policies which Britain had followed since the war.  

Her main ambition was to privatize British Industry, (she believed that govt ownership of businesses created very poorly run and uncompetitive businesses) to reduce very high marginal rates of income tax (the top rates were over 90%).  Thatcher thought this discouraged innovation and entrepreneurialism and (Paradoxically) that it locked in the British class system and favored inherited wealth over meritocracy, as people could not keep enough of whatever money they earned to change their position in society.

In order to make these economic changes, Thatcher had to break the power of the unions.  She also thought that over-powerful unions were another cause of British poor economic performance.

I would say that these economic concerns were her main concerns.  Another post thought that social conservatism was part of Thatcherism.  I'm not sure.  I don't remember any socially conservative policies that she initiated, or any socially liberal policy initiatives that she strongly  resisted.

I think she was perhaps morally conservative, and ideologically driven over pragmatically driven. Her support for the Falkland Islanders was solid, despite the costs and risks.  Her opposition to the Soviet Union was constant.

I think her main objectives were economic.  Did they work?  Here is a look at GDP per capita compared to the USA (USA = 1.000) from 1980 to 2008.

UK:               1980 - .688,  1994 - .705,  2008 - .765

Germany:      1980 - .803,  1994 - .812,  2008 - .763

France:          1980 - .780,  1994 - .730,  2008 - .713

Italy:             1980 - .756,  1994 - .754,  2008 - .675

(Source:  www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=5164)

So, British GDP per capita has been improving relative to the US between 1980 and 2008.  Meanwhile, the other main European Economies were slipping relative to the US.  So, the UK economy has been doing better than the rest of Europe from 1980 to 2008.  It was doing worse than the rest of Europe before 1980:

Here is GDP growth for Britain vs other European countries for the decades after WWII:

UK:           1950-60 - 2.7,    1960-73 - 2.3,  1973-79 - 1.6

US:           1950-60 - 3.3,    1960-73 - 4.2,   1973-79 - 2.7

I think there is pretty good evidence that Thatcherism succeeded in transforming the UK economy's relative performance.  (Thatchers economic policies were never reversed by subsequent governments, even Labor governments.)

Of course, this success came at a cost.  There was short term hardship, as the shift in policies caused some sharp recessions.  There were also winners and losers.  Did the benefits outweigh the costs?  Is criticism of Thatcherism just the whinging of the losers?  Those are good historical questions.

Its  national logistics network is second to none, there will be opportunities to leverage that to grow into new markets that are currently restricted.

There are opportunities to reduce delivery times by using intermediate recipients, local shops, rented delivery boxes - the traditional model of delivery while people are at work is inconvenient and due for a redesign, delivery is a manual cost.


There is a potential for tax restructuring which doesn't exist with publicly owned  companies currently

Ridiculous possession, quite often some lovely play, and as has been our way so far this season, solid at the back (and despite what we've thought of Wanyama himself so far, he's definitely an important cog in that solidarity, though not so much as Lovren who I'm thinking more of every week).

Obviously happy Osvaldo got his goal, hopefully that's him up and running and going to score every week. Lambert of course always a danger from freekicks, and that couldn't have been much more perfect with it off the post (thought their wall could probably have done better).

I still worry about one major thing though, and despite finally getting a goal from open play, we still don't use our possession enough I don't think. We had over 60% against Palace and still only managed three on target (plus the disallowed goal I guess, so 4). I just feel we need to improve our movement up front a little bit, or try to pick up the pace of the passing to get it into the area. It's all fine and dandy playing it calmly up the park and keeping possession, but if we never try a quick one-two through defense, or a through ball into someone's path instead of always to feet, then we'll continue to not make the most of our pressure, and it always leaves games more open than they have to be.

Casing point is the Sunderland game in my opinion, so much pressure, all over them for the whole game pretty much, but just that 3rd minute goal and not getting it in until the 88th that stopped us winning comfortably. West Ham similar, though some of the was purely down to Jaaskelainen, principal still applies though.

And now let's have a look at it properly, well as properly as I can sitting in the desert. So far most of the comments in this are about how those of us in the armed forces are getting rewarded or whatever, and yes I know how people hate seeing others get something they don't get themselves. 

However, as I understand it, this scheme is part of a push specifically designed to save you the tax payer (well those of you on here who pay tax) money. Due to the nature of our jobs and the control over our lives that our employer has, they are required to provide us with accommodation at or near to our place of work. The problem is that a large amount of bases are in such disrepair because of their age, these costs are crippling budgets and us tax payers are spending good money just to keep this shit accommodation just on the right side of being inhabitable, and it's costing us all a fuckton of money, money that we as a country just don't have at the moment. 

These loans are part of a push to try and encourage members of the forces to actually move off base and set up proper family homes rather than relying on base housing. They want more of us living off base because it will save the country money, and given the state of the country's finances, that has to be a good thing.

Anyway, I think we can draw some positives from it; Morrison just keeps getting better and better, and Downing put in some decent crosses.

However, Noble just doesn't want to go forward. 5 minutes left and 1-0 down, but he still just passes it across the back line.

As far as the idea that we should have kept him this season to ease the transition, that simply isn't how it would work, you need to stick with your first choice keeper and as a consequence of that you cannot afford to be spending 100k a week on a reserve goalie, that doesn't even make financial sense for oil money clubs let alone us.

A factory?

&gt;They can dismantle it and sell it for scrap...

And their workers can stop them, and have done so successfully many times before.

&gt;I mean sure they can, and probably would, leave the bulk of it just there to rust.

Fuckers.  Just as they are now.  How much productive capacity is being left to rust in the UK because capitalism is grossly inefficient?  It's about a fifth in the US.

&gt;But you don't seem to understand that they want to leave this country because in the global environment that business is no longer as viable as basing themselves in India.

Because the Indian administration - which Western taxpayers paid heavily to tame - is less interested in the environment, more short termist, more corrupt, more bought and paid for, and - at the end of the day - more prepared to allow the exploitation of its poor for corporate profit which they share in.  So we externalise the cost of business to the developing world and excrete our industrial shit into India as elsewhere...

&gt;business is no longer as viable

Capitalism is no longer as profitable...

&gt;That factory, even if the workers are running it, will have to try and make it profitable and worthwhile whilst competing with a country without draconian and expensive green policies. So you see the problem, right? 

Yup. I think so.  Is it called global capitalism?

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;a lot of the increase in fuel bills has been from Green policies

Source? Given that most of a fuel bill is tax I find this hard to believe. 

Osborne also has to balance the urgency of the problem. We have about 50 years or so until the really serious affects of climate change take effect. The problem is both solvable and given the unsustainablity of fossil fuels will be more profitable as we are forced to switch to renewable energy sources in the future. No doubt there will be a rise in fuel prices in the short term (consider that stage 1) but once renewable sources of energy become cheaper and more widespread they will fall again (consider that stage 2). Stage 1 is unavoidable and stage 2 needs serious investment and research. In terms of fuel prices George Osborne is saying that while prices rise eventually to an unaffordable level he does not want to fund the process by which we can get prices to fall again. It makes no economic sense in the long term but he's a politician, he doesn't have to think about the long term. He just has to win over to his side the climate change sceptics who will likely vote for him or UKIP. In terms of environmental effects he is saying that if it's going to cost him or us money then counter-acting those effects is not worth it. That's simply a betrayal of those who will have to live with the negative effects on sea levels and farming the world over because of his decision. 

I don't mind if fuel prices rise provided we are actually walking down the path to make them fall again. Currently prices are rising anyway and we are doing nothing to prepare for the future. There is no magic wand to wave but there is a long line of scientific research and pilot projects that need to be tested before the problem can be solved and Osborne is refusing to give it the go ahead.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"Willian started in a cup game against Swindon. I imagine he started against Basel because Jose knew of his Champions League experience, and saw him as a better option than our other attacking mids. There is also the issue of rotation. Point is, he's hardly in the first team ahead of Mata. Anyway, you have to give your new signings a chance at some point, if they have to prove themselves before they start, then it's a bit of a catch-22. He didn't play well against Basel, and he didn't play in the next match. He didn't play well against Swindon, and he didn't make the match day squad in the next game. Eto'o's competition is Torres and Ba, who had had mediocre starts. It's hardly as if Jose has been playing him whilst making in-form strikers sit out (though it should be said I thought Torres played well today - he's clearly stating his case). Eto'o's mediocre start has seem him dropped, with Torres coming back in. This is how football tends to work.

I think everyone needs to stop with this persecution/Jose has an agenda bullshit. You think he's been treated badly just because he hasn't been started every match? Ridiculous. No player is entitled to minutes, they all have to earn them, regardless of what they achieved in the past. If only some people in this subreddit had the mature and sensible attitude Mata has had throughout this season - he recognises that his manager has asked something of him, and strived to meet that goal. 

At the start of the season, Mata wasn't match fit. That means he then had to fight his way back into the team, especially considering Jose's doubts about his defensive abilities. The first few chances he was given, he didn't really take, and didn't show much to suggest he deserved to earn his place back. Against Swindon he played well, and today he played even better. Jose has rewarded this improvement, as well as Juan's 'movement towards his vision', or whatever it was he said.

You also have to take into account the amount of contact time Jose has with the squad. We see them play matches. He trains with them for hours every week. How do you know that someone like Schurrle wasn't really impressive in training, whereas Mata might have been less so? You don't have access to this information, whereas Jose does. He is much more qualified to make these decisions, in every sense of the word. I agree that blind faith is not a good thing, but I do trust Jose - he's one of the best managers in the world, and a Chelsea legend. He has earned our trust, our loyalty, and our respect. I know that if Jose decides not to play Mata, it is not personal or to do with nationality. I think it is insulting to suggest otherwise, and incredibly ungrateful to a man who has done so much for our club.

Essentially, Jose has challenged Juan to fight for his place. Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps Jose knows what a player he is, and hence wants to help him achieve anymore? It's a possibility. It's why you give the brightest kids more challenges in school. He has evidently applied himself to do this, and you could now say he has won that fight. A winning squad needs competitiveness, and it needs constant improvement. If a player rises to the challenge set by a manager, then he is improving himself. This can only be good for the squad. It's really a very simple concept.

Sure it's not as bad as some as at least he still has a job but its still been a challenge. The amount doesn't bother me, but it's something that could improve our financial situation.

2.) As an average person it's refreshing that a party wants to do something for me, in my circumstances, as a voter. I don't have kids so Labour / Lib Dem announcements don't benefit me, and I'd still have to pay for it. I can see it the other way, a long term couple that haven't gotten married are supporting my decision to marry, but it's politics, and it's all about being selfish.

Arsenal is doing quite well, but then again they always have their win-streaks followed by losing streaks. They'll level off. They're one or two injuries from being without a CF and DM. They're very good offensively, especially Ramsey this season, but that streak can't last either. 

Liverpool is scary in the short term, but again over the course of the season they'll level off. I can see them grabbing top 6 but just barely so. 

Chelsea doesn't seem to be living up to expectations, fortunately for us. I think they can only get better too, though, and I really see Shurrle taking off in a couple months. He's a really, really fucking good player.

Anyway the point was, yeah I was wrong about the 1st part (I was thinking of last season and including Podolski and Rosicky in the starters of some reason). Don't buy the 'injuries where you have depth' part- the depth in midfield is good, in defense and GK is alright and the wings was great but here we are playing a 4th choice RW and no left wing to speak of. 

As for Giroud, yes him getting injured will be a major blow and I know he is the key to our attack (defense as well at times) but the fact is the team doesn't depend on him for goals. Bendtner or Akpom would not be as big a disaster as people make it out to be, especially once one or more of Cazorla, Podolski and Walcott return (and all of them are pretty close). In any case every team has one guy whose loss would mean a huge setback- Lloris for you, Rooney for United, Coutinho for Liverpool (they're finding that out already), Toure for City and so on... Arsenal aren't really unique when it comes to that.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"You are absolutely correct that no player is entitled to to minutes due to past achievements. Which goes back to my original point. Eto'o and Willian had done nothing to deserve it. So what if Willian has champions league experience? What has done to prove he has earned his minutes? The same can be said for Eto'o. Clearly both of them starting has been disastrous. Yes, you give your new signings a chance, but you don't start them right away, specially not together. 

With Torres, in the games he started, he has played well (Hull and Bayern). His only poor game has been vs Everton, when Mourinho decided to go with 3 in the back which sealed the game.

Mourinho is one of the best managers in the world. But, I'm sorry,""trust"" and ""loyalty"" are far from the words I would describe him. He has taken on 3 clubs in 4 years. How exactly is that loyalty? His words were, he has no reason to leave anymore because he has accomplished his dreams. Those are not something I want to hear from a manager.

I don't think Mourinho has an agenda at all. You say that it is insulting to suggest otherwise, and yet, the man who has carried the club for two years has been treated so.

You can challenge a player without having to ""put him in his place"". Mata is not a petulant child like Rooney. Challenging someone like that can cause a rift in a team. All you have to do is look his last gig. He challenged Iker, which caused turmoil within the squad. Even Ronaldo, his love affair, has rejected him. 

AVB - Challenged the old guard, did not react very well. Played terrible, sacked.

Mourinho - Challenged Iker, Pepe, and Ramos, did not react very well. Played terrible, left the team.

It is completely unnecessary to create problems for yourself. There are better ways to motivate someone, specially like a Mata.

And I know that she was one of many companions. I guess it just seemed like she meant so much to the Doctor, more than Sara-Jane, more than his own life on multiple occasions, that I just don't know how believable it's going to be that he simply moves on. Yeah so her time with him was a blip on the radar of his life. But still. I dunno maybe I am just a hopeless romantic. I know the show has only grown in popularity, so obviously there is merit for that. I guess I am just still in shock that they cut that storyline so soon. American TV usually beats something that's working like that to death. I've noted that is not always the case with tales from across the pond. Which, maybe is for the best.

Well, sorry for the rant. I will soldier on. One last though- they could have just made him say ""I love you."" FFS it wouldn't have been any cheesier than ""Rose, I think you need a Doctor."" I get that he's a ""it doesn't have to be said"" kind of guy, And i've read what happens in season 4. But it wouldn't have killed anyone to just have said it.

Kelly-Kolo-Sakho-Jose

------Lucas-Gerrard------

Suarez-Hendo-Sterling

---------Danny S.----------

Bench: Moses, Jones, Alberto, Agger, Allen, Skrtel, Aspas

**Hendo** needs to be played in the middle.  He's so much more effective there.  He passes, he runs, he shoots, he covers, he runs some more.  On the wing he does well enough, but it doesn't play to his strengths.  He has the legs to make up for Stevie's age, which needs to happen these days.

**Kelly** should start because he can play right back better than any of our other center backs.  

**Kolo** and **Sakho** are hard to argue with, form-wise.  They're big, they play the ball, they defend crosses, and are just all around beasts.  I suppose there's a shout for Skrtel, but he'd be taking Kolo's place and I'd rather see Toure.

**Jose** because Cissokho is injured, and he's our only real left back.

**Lucas** and **Gerrard** are no-brainers.  Yes, even though Gerrard may not have been at his best the past two games.

**Suarez** also needs to start, because he is Suarez, but he shouldn't start in the center.  He's just coming back into the team and the wing is an easier transition in.

Also, **Danny** has been doing wonderfully up top; he deserves to stay there.

I mostly agree with /u/SHOOPDAWOOPLOL's lineup, so instead of posting something very similar, I wanted to post a 5-back lineup that I don't really see much of in this thread. I really did like our use of the 5-back (or 3 back) formation against United, and until Glen is back for us, I think this is a very good formation to use.

I haven't given up on Aspas yet and here's why; Moses has been great but seems to lose his spark in the 60th minute or so, which is when we have been subbing in Sterling, whose looked lost as an impact sub. Moses is also a more traditional winger, and wouldn't quite fit in the system (especially in the first half, where a stricter tactical structure is necessary). I think Aspas is a better fit as a withdrawn winger than Sterling and Moses. He's got pace, but his movements are far better as a more central attacker. With both Sturridge and Suarez on the field, he'll get more space to operate in, and I believe he'd utilize the space better than Sterling or Moses. I'm also a strong advocate for starting Sterling and having Moses come on as an impact sub. In that case, I'd really like to see Aspas come on for Sturridge, who's started to look fatigued in the 2nd half.",0,1380407163,null,0,false,0,cch8hiv,t3_1nbnwp,t1_cch8hiv,t3_1nbnwp,null,1429311825,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Moses played best on the wing, so I'd keep him there. 

I think a back 3 can really suit of CBs. Having 3 can cover Skrtel when he gets caught out in a high line, allowing us to get the best out of him, though is Agger is fit he's an obvious started in my opinion.

My reason for no Enrique is that whilst he's the best athlete in the league probably, he makes stupid decisions and loses or wastes possession far too often.

The main reason for my happiness is that this famous gelling that we had been telling all the other fans, especially the goons with all the ""spent 100m and still lost, shit without Bale"", would happen actually seems to be happening already when I expected maybe an improvement after Christmas. Don't take that for granted as it could so easily have gone the other way. 

Holtby looks like a different player, Dembele seems to have found his Maradona boots, Eriksen has adapted very quickly not just to the league but the expectation. Defoe continues to be dangerous and his age hasn't had a negative impact. Paulinho is a goal threat, pops up with headers and gets in the box. Siggy also seems better than last season too and is getting us goals. Soldado has been great for the team and I have no doubt he will start banging them in. Townsend is regularly skinning people and seems to have cemented his place as a regular in the rotation, again it's like having another new signing. None of us have missed Bale because it seems the goals will come without him. 

We have a manager that seems to be universally liked, even by opposing fans, he is a fucking gentleman (see him going to the Chelsea bench before the game today and also making sure he stopped to have a word with Mourinho and put to bed any stories of some kind of war between them) and he could be our Fergie. 

And what makes me absolutely wet is that we are playing attractive football again, pass and move, threading balls through the middle instead of constantly going to the goal line, one touch flicks and back heels, dribbling past 2 or 3 players. To watch Bale was amazing last season but for me the team wasn't attractive, we didn't have the trickery to play through a defence and we didn't play the Tottenham way.

 * You offered [this photo](https://scontent-b-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/q71/s720x720/1011627_437182223063568_1348148688_n.jpg) as evidence you do not need to apply for MLR.  I've received a similar reply when asking about selling Bitcoin.  However this letter is useless without context.  Your site appears to allow users to sell *their own Bitcoin*, and presumably this indicates you have the facility to make transfers to them when they cash out.  If this vital part of your operations is not covered in your original letter, you're possibly committing an offence by running that business.
 * What's your plan for VAT?  Because BTC isn't recognised as a currency and doesn't share the tax benefits of actual currencies, past the VAT threshold revenue of ~£70k you'll possibly need to register, and charge VAT on a lot of orders.  This can make the entire business nonviable, unless you have is structured more creatively.
 * [This page on HMRC](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/mlr/getstarted/register/who.htm) is about who needs to register with MLR.  Specifically it gives the examples of ""*most UK financial and credit businesses such as currency exchange office, cheque cashers or money transmitters
independent legal professionals*"" and ""*'High Value Dealers' - businesses that accept cash payments for goods worth 15,000 euros or more either in a single transaction or in installments*"".  I struggle to find a definition of what a money trasmitter is in the eyes of the law, what definition did you find and does you allowing users to cash out their GBP fall into this category?
 * Also following on, what systems do you have in place to not allow a single customer to make 15k euros of orders?  This is severely limiting for this sort of business
 * ""IBWT works with government approval"" - Apart from the letter above, what other approval have you received exactly?
 * Who is your business bank?  It would be useful to know as it would help a lot of people, me included, who are struggling to get our feet in the door
 * ""As already mentioned, we are not at liberty to discuss the details of the interaction with HM Government's related bodies."" - Why not?  Did your communication with them explicitly forbid you to share?  (Any proof of this?)
 * Following on from above, does the restriction just forbid sharing copies of the actual primary resource?  Ie, can you write a report about the materials instead and share that?
 * ""I am (on behalf of IBWT) also fighting for extensive multiple access to the bitcoin economy"" - What else are you doing?  (Not a troll question, I'm also trying my best to do the same and want to learn as much as I can about what various people are doing for the cause if I can help in any way)

Do you not understand what being a supporter of a football club actually means? 
 
It is trust, it is belief, and it is S U P P O R T.  Through thick and thin.  Aspas, for example, is currently a Liverpool player.  If, in 1 years time, he's sold, and we all palm-face a little bit, then so be it.  But right now, he's a LIVERPOOL PLAYER.  The reason this sub is, oh, I don't know, perhaps a little POSITIVE about the team they love, or quick to downvote (particularly premature) negativity, is because that is the job description of being a supporter.  Yes, I can sit down and analysis objectively the strengths and weaknesses of a Chelsea or a Man City (as I do not have a relationship with those clubs), and even, to an extent, Liverpool. But, realistically, I will always have rose-tinted glasses - I will ALWAYS hope for the best from every player who pulls on that shirt, every young academy player and every player that costs millions of pounds.  If they are a little shitty at first, I will hope against the odds that they come good.  Because for every Poulsen, you have a Lucas, for every Carroll (and damn it if I didn't love how hard he tried), you have a Henderson - and when you see those players, the players you SUPPORTED from the beginning, when you see them show, without doubt, that they are good enough for this club, the pride and joy that you are able to experience, WITHOUT HYPOCRISY, is the best feeling you can have as a supporter.  And for the players who fail, you can wish them luck with the rest of their career, knowing that they have done their job to the best of their ability, but that they just didn't quite cut it, but regardless, as a fan, to have supported them anyway, you know that you have done YOUR job to the best of your ability too. 

(For players who break your heart, like say a Fernando Torres it's a little more complicated...).

This, and I cannot stress this enough, this is the BARE MINIMUM of what it takes to be a supporter of this club.  Yes, you can discuss and disagree with decisions, complain about a player's performance, but attacking, in any shape or form, a current player (or manager) for Liverpool goes against EVERYTHING this club was built upon.  
There's a mantra here, that you may have heard of, it isn't too well known.  Actually, never mind, I can't remember the precise way it goes anyway... I know Daniel Agger has the acronym tattooed onto his knuckles, I know that much.  But it's no big deal.  Look it up maybe if you have the time.  Or check out some Daglish quotes, some Carragher, Gerrard, or some Shankley (particularly his quote about the 'holy trinity') quotes about what it means to be part of Liverpool Football Club, and then try to argue that your attitude is appropriate.

TL;DR: you're being downvoted, essentially, because you're not acting like a SUPPORTER of Liverpool should.  Yes, 'fans' of clubs (including our own) may have built up around the years, bringing with them a slight ignorance of the history of the club, what it stands for etc., or, indeed, the lack of patience that seems to be often claimed to have taken over the younger generations of the world (I'm not old myself), could be blamed, but whatever the reason, the truth is this: we are all here, on this subreddit, as supporters of Liverpool.  You can act like one, or your contribution can be pissed upon. 

In the words of Bill Shankly, 'it's terribly simple'.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"It is like banging my head against a brick wall. Quite literally, in the sense that I feel like I might have lasting cognitive effects due to the head trauma of attempting to make some rational sense out of what you have just said.

Mata is not being mistreated, he hasn't started a few games. Who has said Jose is putting Mata in his place? Since when has Mata been out of his place? That literally makes no sense. Who the hell are you quoting? Jose hasn't said that, Mata hasn't said that, I haven't said that. I can only conclude that you are quoting your own flatulence.

You appear to have completely missed my point regarding trust and loyalty. I will repeat it in the hope that this time it will make an impact. Jose has earned ***our*** trust and loyalty. That has nothing to do with whether or not Jose is a trusting or loyal person. I am disregarding this entire portion of your comment as it is based on your misunderstanding.

As for the Real Madrid situation. 2nd in La Liga, semi-finals of the Champions League, final of the Copa del Rey = terrible. Okay. Maybe in lolwhat land, but I think we've already discovered what a strange and terrifying place that is. But anyway, I don't wish to discuss that (though you will, no doubt). The politics at Real Madrid are something else, and what happened there is in no way comparable to the situation at Chelsea. There is a reason why the players who played under Mourinho and Chelsea and Inter still worship him, but they don't at Madrid. They are anomalous, and Juan Mata does not have the ego or entitlement of Iker Casillas or Cristiano Ronaldo. I see no reason for you to talk about this situation

If I had to look at it from a psychological point of view, I'd say you are very insecure, and are terrified of Mata throwing a tantrum and leaving. This is incredibly unlikely, given what we know about Mata's character and professionalism, so I'd like to reassure you on that. (Players like Mata do not leave just because they didn't start a few games, and as I've said before on this issue, if Mata did want to leave as a result of not starting every game under Mourinho, then good riddance, because that is a pathetic reason for wanting to leave a club, and indicative of very poor character.) You also put too much stock in the opinions of outsiders. You see people with little understanding of the situation criticising Chelsea, and this upsets you, as most can't bear to see their club criticised. So you take it out on Jose. Thing is, most football fans will use *anything* as a stick to beat Chelsea with - if not this, then it would be something else. I am merely speculating here though, so don't take this as gospel.

Unless you have actually managed to read and understand my argument, unlike last time, I would ask you to not attempt to refute it again. I have had this argument several different times on this subreddit, and my views are clear. Your views are less clear, due to your inability to write a coherent argument, but I think I have the general gist of it. Whilst we are discussing clarity, it is also evident you will not alter my opinion on this in any way, shape or form. I doubt I will alter your opinion, either. I replied initially because you asked a question. I sensed where you were going with your question, so answered very comprehensively in the attempt to pre-empt you. I obviously did not succeed. I have replied a second time in order to address some glaring misconceptions and fallacies in your argument, just for closure.

&gt; **Introducing BBC iPlayer Downloads**
&gt; 
&gt; The way you download TV programmes has changed.
&gt; 
&gt; BBC iPlayer Downloads is a new download service that replaces BBC iPlayer Desktop and WMV downloads.
&gt; 
&gt; We've simplified the service, offering the ability to download and play a programme from BBC iPlayer. Programmes can be kept up to 30 days and you have 7 days to watch after you first start to play a download.
&gt; 
&gt; **How is BBC iPlayer Downloads different from BBC iPlayer Desktop?**
&gt; 
&gt; We've completely rebuilt our download service.
&gt; 
&gt; BBC iPlayer Downloads is a much simpler offering compared to BBC iPlayer Desktop. While BBC iPlayer Desktop allowed you to download programmes, set-up automatic downloads using the series record feature and offered the ability to stream BBC TV channels; it sometimes proved unreliable especially when third party updates were installed.
&gt; 
&gt; With BBC iPlayer Downloads we've concentrated in providing a service that allows you to download a programme, watch it and delete the programmes once expired. That's it. We believe that keeping it simple offers an improved and more reliable experience.
&gt; 
&gt; For more information, please read the BBC [Internet Blog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/posts/BBC-iPlayer-Downloads) by Dan Taylor the head of BBC iPlayer.",0,1380419842,null,0,1380422360,0,cchc5c8,t3_1nckg0,t1_cchc5c8,t3_1nckg0,null,1429310117,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

our attack looked as good as it has all season against utd midweek, we rediscovered the cohesiveness between players and tactics that had been lacking in other games.

really like the 3412 formation and with three brilliant centre backs in toure, sakho and agger, it makes the most sense from that perspective. henderson is a brilliant crosser and has a great engine, he's got the traits for a very good wing back.

jose is jose, no-one knows what goes on in his head, mash potato on steroids probably, but he's powerful, pacy and penetrative when he's told to attack.

gerrard and lucas haven't been in best of form but what other centre mids have we got? pick themselves.

suarez and sturridge have to play, we need goals therefore we need them. moses in behind after his game against utd, he looked good but wouldnt mind seeing alberto there either.

Something like;

Maybe swap Collins for Tomkins next game too, Tomkins played very well today.

He can not manage even the simplest tasks such as using traffic lights to cross the road or making a bowl of cereal on his own without supervision, he requires 24/7 one on one professional care and his condition means that he can often be violent when not medicated properly, to the extent that he has hospitalised random people on the street because he lashed out whilst delusional. 

Because his current care home is likely to close when the owner and prime funder retires we are looking for other options, yet the hoops they make you jump through are ludicrous. He has had the same life-long condition and very clear needs for the past 30 years, yet still we get crap about 'work assessments' and 'living in the community' 

Our ambitions for him are that he can sit still and have someone read a story to him or that he can be taken on a supervised day trip without problems or that we can find medication for his mood swings that doesn't make him ill, the idea that he's fit for any sort of work is absurd and anyone who spends 5 minutes with him realises it. Social workers that deal with him tend to start off with grand plans and then very quickly get a massive dose of realism.

My argument is that capitalism is great at cheap mass production, it's great at producing huge numbers of niched variations on a theme, it's great at ""adding value"", but it's not so great at basic R &amp; D in completely new fields and genuine innovation - that's where collectivism always seems to win out - thus computers, the Internet, telecommunications, civil aviation, etc. **all** of which were funded collectively.  In the world of medical advances, most of the major advances are publicly funded (State sector, public grants, public universities), whilst the private sector produces endless small improvements and variations on a theme (often just to extend their State-protected patents).

&gt;And no, the USSR did not resemble a perfect capitalist state. You have no idea what you're talking about.

Do I not?  And you conveniently missed out two crucial words - an *almost* perfect *State* capitalist regime.  What happened in Russia was that the private sector gave way to the State sector, but most of the large urban industrial operations continued to be operated along capitalist lines throughout the USSR's lifespan, with private bosses and shareholders replaced with party bosses and State bureaucrats.  Similar, though not so extreme, things happened during the large scale nationalisations in the UK post-war to the seventies - this has little to do with genuine socialism, it's State capitalism.  Socialism is workers' control over the means of production, not State control.

&gt;There was next to no free market whatsoever.

And free markets have nothing to do with capitalism, in fact the two ideas are antithetical.  Capitalists don't want free markets, they want markets rigged in their favour by the State.  Indeed, markets have nothing to do with capitalism, if by markets you mean trade, since trade and exchange preceded capitalism by, well, by almost all of human history, since capitalism has only been around for a blink of an eye (since the 1600s at the very earliest, and in a recognisable form since the 1700s, and even then it was mercantilist capitalism, which many ""free"" marketeers try to disown as something else).

&gt;The state tried to stamp out a free market.

Well, doh!  That's what States do, it's called capitalism!

Start applying for relevant work or volunteering in the UK before you leave Australia and don't come here until you have something solid lined up. Contacts at this stage are more important than job description, making the tea at a company you'd want to work for is okay, the point is to get people who can offer you the stuff you want to know and like you. The industry is extremely competitive and insular, so you have to build strong personal relationships, this takes time if you're an outsider and you may need to work a humdrum job such as bar work to tied you over whilst you're getting established. 

There are so many people applying for so few jobs in this sector that I can't recommend moving here to try to get one, secure either a job or a decent volunteer placement first and have that as your reason to move here.

These obviously need to be well run to prevent non-dependent users receiving heroin they don't use and selling it on to recreational users, or dependent users getting more than they actually need and doing the same, but both of these problems are familiar to specialist drug services already.  Legalisation would help here enormously, by reducing costs and thus undercutting the market for resale, by facilitating dependent drug users getting their drug of choice (usually heroin) rather than the drug the ""system"" thinks they ought to have (usually methadone, which many drug users hate enough to sell on in order to buy heroin on the streets), and by allowing them to set up clean, medically-supervised shooting galleries in order that drugs don't leak and that good injecting practices can be passed on to help prevent the spread of hepatitis/HIV etc, overdose, absesses, necrosis, collapsed veins, and so on.

Obviously, heroin maintenance has issues - short term of effect, much more significant euphoria (one of the reasons users prefer it) - but it also has benefits - many users complain that withdrawal from methadone is actually harder and longer.  Clearly staff and service users need to discuss these things, but subject to specialist input, this should be a choice and not an imposition.  There's good evidence that people on heroin maintenance programmes can hold down jobs, raise families, etc. and anecdotally I can tell you that in your average specialist substance misuse centre it's the alcoholics who look most fucked up, whereas the ""pure"" opiate users who are well-managed you could pass on the street without ever knowing.",0,1380438579,null,0,false,0,cchghxe,t3_1nbyf1,t1_cchghxe,t1_cch893n,null,1429306936,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You easily brush of how Mourinho dealt with Real Madrid as it is convenient for you. AVB did the exact same thing, and yet he was chastised by the fans. Like the rest of your post, all you have done is make excuses for him. 

It is a good thing you aren't a licensed psychologist. Because, quite honestly, I don't really care if Mata throws a tantrum and decides to leave. I've made several postings stating that If I had a choice between Oscar/Mata and Hazard, I would prefer to keep Oscar and Hazard over Mata. 

In fact, Mata's response has been what I expected from him all along. Mata has been a class act and I expected nothing less from him. Again, the whole point of this is the fact that Mata is a class act and there was no need for Mourinho to ""challenge"" him the way he did. There are better ways to deal with a player. What did it accomplish? Mata showing that he is capable of playing football? All it did was create tabloid talk. Something Chelsea does not need.

&gt; I really don't see why people complain about them

Part of the appeal of the countryside is asthetic and in my county that has been utterly destroyed. I wouldn't mind that if it was done for a worthwhile benefit but it isn't. It is done purely to please the eco-mentalists. All those wind turbines in my county from Monday to Friday generated absolutely sod all electricity as there was virtually no wind. Today the wind speed is sufficient that the most efficient turbine in the world would be able to run at 100% output however the turbines put up are not these Siemens ones so aren't.

You could put up one coal power station or a nuclear power station in my county and the output would be a hundredfold that of all of these wind turbines and more importantly it would be as required and meet 100% of the county's energy requirements.

Wind turbines are put up for nothing more than vote winning and giving the government something big to point at to say ""we're doing something"".

We have now going on for 5,000 wind turbines in the UK generating 10,000MW **maximum** wind generating capacity in the UK, although most of the time it is below that. Heysham nuclear power station alone has 25% of that generating capacity. 1250 wind turbines cause a lot more disruption to the countryside and take up a lot more room than a single nuclear power station.

Headteachers can also grant extended leave for more than ten school days in exceptional circumstances.

Amendments to the 2006 regulations remove references to family holiday and extended leave as well as the statutory threshold of ten school days. The amendments make clear that headteachers may not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances.

true,griznok,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; 1. - PRICE. The price of a single onshore turbine is much lower than that of an offshore one, and can (at maximum efficiency) pay back within a decade.

Doesn't even need to be maximum efficiency. Just needs to produce enough power that it offsets it's CAPEX and OPEX costs, anything more than that is profit. Generally this will be done in 5-15 years onshore and (currently) 10-20 years offshore. Both onshore and offshore are both working hard to bring costs down, onshore is a long way ahead since the technology is about 20-30 years further on. 

&gt; 2. - SUITABILITY TO THE UK. This is a MAJOR pothole. As I mentioned previously, the only place in the UK capable of generating the needed wind power to rotate a wind turbine over 60% of the time is off the east coast of Scotland. This means that onshore, and land based wind turbines RARELY make their money back within 15 years, and more often take up to 20. When maintenance and damages are taken into account, their economic relevance plummets even further.

Nonsense. The UK has a south westerly prevailing wind, the best windspeeds are on the West coast, but even then if a site is designed properly and the right turbine class is chosen, almost anywhere can be a viable (profitable) site. 

&gt; In 2011 (I think) there was a crisis in the north sea where the wind farms were producing too much power, and consequently could not be used by the national grid due to their unstable supply.

Never happened. And even if it did that wouldn't be a crisis, all turbines come with a curtailment system now, so all that would happen is that the windfarm would produce a little less than it's maximum output. 

&gt;Please don't misunderstand me, I am a great supporter of renewable energy research, but I am simply far more interested in ones which have a greater chance of working, and being economically feasible and profitable! (if you are a researcher yourself, you will know that profitability is absolutely king in energy production.)&gt;

Wind power is by far the most economic renewable energy we have. Tidal is struggling to get off the ground as it has huge upfront costs and large OPEX costs, wave power lasts about 5 minutes in a storm due to the huge amounts of energy in the sea, biomass is very difficult to source enough of in a reliable way, solar is coming down in price but can only produce power for very short periods in the winter when the power is needed most.

I work for one of the major utilities in Northern Europe as a Wind resource analyst, I spend all day at work calculating expected power outputs of wind farms we're developing in the UK. I have a reputation within the company for being ruthless with regards to killing off prospective projects for not being profitable enough and still the majority of sites are feasible. As the price of the turbines and associated infrastructure are coming down less projects are classed as not profitable enough. 

The biggest issue that the onshore wind industry is facing in the UK is running out of land to build on. We're a very densely populated country but thats fine since we're also investing in R&amp;D into Wave, tidal, solar, biomass and Offshore Wind to try and make them viable for the future.",0,1380446574,null,0,false,0,cchhi0n,t3_1nb0yi,t1_cchhi0n,t1_cchcgft,null,1429306456,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

From the perspective of a teacher if a kid misses a lesson outside of an examined course its a big ""so what?"". They just do the work later, or don't. Its really up to them. 

The exception is at Key Stage 4, where they will be sitting GCSEs, and at Key Stage 5 for A levels. Then kids missing material is a significant problem, and permission should not be given. Arguments can also be made for less able children, and those with special educational needs or behavioural difficulties at Key Stage 3. Any material relevant to the exam will have to be covered, and no teacher is going to trust that Mrs McGonnagal back in Year 6 covered that one crucial fact with prime numbers, so he can just skip it and assume the kids know.

At any point before that it is going to matter sweet FA to the child's progress, and, unless you are planning some kind of activity or play with assigned parts, then a kid being absent is just an empty seat from the perspective of a teacher. And the solution to the play issue is simple- kids going on holiday don't get parts.

The obsession with not allowing holidays is an entirely new phenomenon manufactured by central government who crudely use it in attendance figures, and have put a lot of pressure on heads, who in turn have had to pass it on. 

Taking holidays in term time used to be largely un-policed. The only real effect enforcement has had has been to deny poor children the chance to experience travelling abroad that their wealthier peers can enjoy.

This is an experience far more valuable in my opinion than a 9 year old learning what autumn is for the 5th time.

Yes, people make a lifestyle choice to have kids. But kids don't chose to have poor parents, and the education system should not be about further denying them experiences their wealthier peers can have purely due to pointless bureaucratic anal retentiveness. 

Easter and Christmas holidays also experience a massive price spike. School holidays=price spike.

If it was at Key Stage 4, then the head just needed to not give permission. Discretion solved this problem admirably before, and if necessary the law could forbid KS4 and KS5 holidays in order to avoid harrasment by parents.

This is a problem with a very easy solution. Keeping kids  inwho are at Key Stage 4 and 5 (GCSE and A Level) to whom a week of school actually is significant, should not mandate forcing all other children, including those at primary,  to miss affordable, short, foreign holidays.

To a ten year old doing material that they will cover again in year 7, in year 9, and then probably again at GCSE, if it was actually important, a week of school is a very small deal indeed.

Anyway, once it starts getting really cold gloves by themselves aren't enough, for two reasons:

1. Speed: If it's 5˚ outside then riding at 80mph will feel like standing still at -10˚.

2. Rain: If your hands are wet then they will get cold much faster because water is a much better conductor of heat than air. And even with waterproof gloves it's pretty easy for the rain to run down the cuffs soaking them on the inside.

My strategy at the moment is to use a pair of muffs ([more info](http://www.bikechatforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=231946)) with thin summer gloves.

At the moment, when you buy a bag of weed, criminality is concerned in its supply at all levels.  Recently in Glasgow they raided a grow house in which they found several teenage Vietnamese children who didn't speak English, who subsequently said to translators that they had been trafficked in order to maintain the crop.

People have to want to get clean and be prepared for all the issues it's going to bring to the surface (don't forget, many to most drug-dependant individuals have histories of abuse and neglect, plus their own shame, guilt and self-loathing about their actions).

I think that's a universal thing to irk people irrespective of them being benefits claimants or not. 

I had a DWP manager put me on 'disability', I wasn't totally sure it was the right call but that's what the DWP manager said so go with it right?  Especially as it paid no more or less than JSA.   

In and out of ATOS I went then off to the Tribunal because basically that manager did not recall ever saying that, none of the medical specialists dealing with me were ever contacted and neither was the witness I'd had in that meeting.   

That took two very stressful years to resolve.  But more important they were still paying me a £45p/w token amount.  Between the letters, the time of the solicitor and GP who run your case, the time of the witness all of that cost the country money. 

Which cost more the manager actually admitting to what she'd said and dealing with it.   

So it's not just that they're wasting money, it's that they actively enjoy wasting money that needs to stop. ",0,1380456195,null,0,false,0,cchihg3,t3_1nc2xs,t1_cchihg3,t1_cchg8ws,null,1429305997,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Protesters often break the law - it's an obvious consequence of their core activity: protesting against laws with which they disagree. Of *course* they get arrested and charged. Do bears shit in the woods? Why... yes, yes they do.

The illegality of protesters' activities is completely orthogonal to their ultimate failure or success &amp; legitimacy. Here are some law breaking protesters whose demands are now considered normal, and basic to any civilized society:

- *The Manchester Patriotic Union.* Demanded free and fair elections. Organised an illegal protest in 1819 that was broken up by the authorities - an event that came to be known as [the Peterloo Massacre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterloo_Massacre) Result: free and fair elections.

- *Women's Social and Political Union.* Demanded women's suffrage. Instigated a widespread and violent campagn of smashing shop windows, burning stately homes and bombing public buildings, [amongst many other criminal tactics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Social_and_Political_Union#Campaigning_becomes_more_militant) Result: women's suffrage.

- *Non-cooperation Movement.* Demanded Indian independence from the British Empire. Resisted the British government by a number of non-violent, yet illegal means. Protesters were [dealt with very harshly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre) by the authorities. Result: Indian independence.

You know that THC is present in all strains of cannabis, right? even those (what are usually referred to as) 1970's 'harmless' strains.

If you're referring to relative percentages, for the most part, commercial (the stuff most people can buy) 'Skunks' are no 'stronger' (active compounds [thc/cbd/cba+n et al.]) than a good quality 'Jamaican' or 'Thai' cannabis [there are those who would advance the position that a high quality Jamaican bud is more 'mind altering' than any commercially available skunk] - but I digress.

The biggest complaints about everyday jobsites are 

* that the jobs are often still advertised after they've been filled.
* the pages are often filled with multiple listings for the same job.
* lots of agency listings which don't accurately describe the job.

Any jobsite that overcomes these types of issues is going to need either a very clever way of sorting the available, unique jobs from repeat listings, or a fair amount of manpower (crowdsourced or individual) to do the heavy lifting itself.

If you're aiming the subreddit at a certain generation, you could perhaps limit the listings to interesting jobs that wouldn't be highlighted on other everyday jobsites... 

I'm happy to contribute to the site as I love the idea, but you'd have to either be very smart about the design and advertising, or very lucky with the people who start the site rolling.

Are you really trying to argue that Parliament would have introduced universal suffrage in the absence of the protest movements demanding it? It's difficult to disprove a hypothetical, but I find your claim incredible.

&gt; Where would you draw the line with protesters breaking the law?

I don't understand what you mean. What ""line""? I think that people who break the law should be prosecuted. That applies to protesters, just as it does to anyone else. The rule of law is a crucial foundation for a well ordered society.

You seem to be drawing a false equivalence between ""lawful"" and ""moral"", when in reality any connection between the two is tenuous at best.

&gt; Oh, it's those same old beardy weirdies... hard working sane people...

That's just meaningless name-calling. Protest groups are always demonised by those who oppose them. Activists who worked for women's suffrage were ridiculed as ""suffragettes"", and called ""insane"" and ""hysterical"". Gandhi was derided as a charlatan. Churchill called him ""nauseating"".

Edit : You edited the comment from ""Look it up"" to this now that I provided you a source? You look through it. 

Courtois never does something like this and I've watched him play most of his career. He didn't look up to see the clock, if you've ever been to a stadium you'd know where the clock is and where he looked. 

His first reaction was to look at the ball then the pain kicked in. He was holding his hand even after he got up. 

You sound like someone who has neither watched him play nor has played himself and be injured while playing. Try to look through it without your /r/Soccer ""classy"" goggles and maybe you'll see better.

You can blame Conservatives for cutting the benefit bill if you wish but Labour enforced the EXACT same policy in 2008 in its reform of Housing Benefit for these renting form private landlords.

Both tenants, PRS or Social. Are equally vulnerable but until 2013 those in social housing got special treatment. In addition - today, they still do with no SHP evicting any tenant.

As for ""new tenancies"" Social Tenants tend to have long term tenancies, so it would be a useless policy to tackle the Overcrowding Situation we find many vulnerable families in today. PRS the average is Six Months, also its not just on New Tenancies its on New Claims for example includes sibling leaving to go to university.

The government, is very happy with this policy I imagine. You opposition can't dodge responsibility for its influence on current policies.

Incorrect, the PRS has lots of 1 bedroom housing. Social housing is such a ""very small"" part of the housing sector. The policy is to fix overcrowding, NOT to punish 1 person living in a four bed property for life.

Human nature is not selfish. The selfsh aspect of human nature is painstakingly cultivated in the interests of the richest in society. For a couple of hundred thousands of years human communities were cooperative, everything was shared. Only in recent history did selfishness even become an option. Every day I interact with different people and I see very little evidence of cuntishness. Once people become part of institutions that mandate selfish behaviour or they adopt selfish ideologies, they act selfishly. It is not a prominent feature of human beings.  

If you teach your children to compete and to resent someone else's stuff, you will end up with people who think it's natural to be selfish.

We now have a chance to get a much needed win as well as three crucial points. After a DLL streak, against a team that's at the bottom of the table and in turmoil, we need that W. In other words, this is a game we should and must win by all accounts, not only because of Sunderland's present crisis, but also because even against a full strength Sunderland, we need to win these types of games if we are to rise above the mid-table mediocrity we have been consigned to last few seasons. An L here would really set LFC back not only on the table but in terms of team and supporter morale, and will really cast a big question mark on BR's managerial abilities, IMO. Given that Suarez is back in the team also, even squeaking out a win will not be too good on Rodgers. Here's hoping that we come out with that blood lust and killer instinct we seem to be lacking at times too often lately, and show the EPL and ourselves that we *DO* have the desire to win and the ambition to go to war for the top of the table!

TL;DR: Must win game for LFC and Rodgers. Given the turmoil Sunderland is in, lose and people will now really question Rodgers' managerial abilities, and will really take wind out of our sails.",0,1380464790,null,0,false,0,cchjvom,t3_1ndgf3,t1_cchjvom,t3_1ndgf3,null,1429305346,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

How to childproof your house, and how to take some goddamn responsibility for the life you just spawned.

edit: I have emailed ...... again, please let me know if this is NOT your email.

&gt;So you're saying me and /u/gurglemonster are lying about the spelling and grammatical errors that were there a few days ago?

Yes, I am saying he was lying and trolling. Btw, we started pre-launch so we could find spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, the team is human and prone to mistakes I'm afraid. We wanted help with people to point them out .. hence why I asked him.. where? can you point them out please? (and we publicly said via our fb outlet, this is to help us spot mistakes, feel free to try us out during pre-launch, email support@ibwt.co.uk if you find anything, thank you, etc, etc)

There was actually a typo in an email that someone else pointed out for us, and this was the whole point of pre-launch.. but the person (that you indicate) failed to point anything out and kept bleating on about spelling mistakes, like you are doing, hence the inclination towards troll'ish behaviour. Aka, repetitive derogatory comments with no factual or physical evidence and reasons for self-interest to downtalk another entity.

It's perfectly fine, this is just the way things are. But we would be quite happy if people did actually point out the spelling mistakes. But if him and you keep wanting to state there are, and no one else can see anything .. well .. ok .... each to their own ....

Someone with schizophrenia or bipolar would never say, ""I used to be someone with a mental health problem but I'm all better now"", because it just doesn't work like that.

Severe mental illness changes your life forever. With a very few exceptions, it circumscribes who you can be forever. It is often impossible to hide, and can be very obvious to an observer even from a distance. You end up existing on benefits, often heavily medicated, often written off by the medical profession and society.

So no, I don't think that if you had depression or puerpural psychosis or something for a short while, you're in a position to dismiss the concerns of those of us who live with our problems every day, who can't go outside our front door without facing the consequences of people's lazy prejudice against the mentally ill.

true,teaprincess,eng-Eastanglia,A country bumpkin in the Big Smoke,"&gt; In your previous comment, the ""if"" was referring to whether I had lived with someone with mental health problems. 

The ""if"" was referring to whether you had experience of living with mental health problems yourself, actually. So please do not try to tell me what I meant when saying something. I am perfectly aware of what I mean and what I do not mean.

Look, I'm not trying to be hostile so please do not direct your anger at me. I am just trying to say that it is not professional for a public official to be using pejorative language that concerns people with mental illnesses. It is especially not appropriate to direct that language at a potential child rape victim.

I concede that, as you pointed out, it is probably a generalisation to say that people will consider it to be silencing them and not everyone will be affected by it. However, dismissal of people as crazy is a silencing tactic.

There are lives lost every year due to people fearing the repercussions of speaking openly about their illness. They are scared of attitudes like these.

I was mercilessly bullied at university by a select group of people who (somehow - despite it being confidential) found out about my long-term mental health problem (which actually began due to childhood trauma and abuse) and thought it was a great way to dismiss everything I said. This was after living in silence for 21 years because I had feared that something like this would happen. They thought it was funny to joke about it, to ""out"" me about my suicide attempt, in public situations and attempt to humiliate and silence me in front of other people.

I suspect this was largely due to an inability to empathise with other human beings.

Yes, you're right - my bad.  I misread your original comment.  My apologies.

I just don't find this offensive in the same way that some people are desperately trying to.   And I think a lot of people who do, are more interested in the ""fuck the tories"" cause, than they are about the issue of mental health. It's just a convenient bat to hit the guy with, which makes them guilty of exploiting a sensitive issue for their own ends - arguably as bad, if not worse than Pickles himself.   I think it was rude and insulting to that individual, but nothing more. 

Personally I just think he grabbed whatever the nearest thing to hand was without thinking.  Not much different than someone who got annoyed with Eric himself, targeting his size and telling him to ""shut up you fat fuck"".  Does that individual hate all fat people, or were they just frustrated and momentarily lost their cool?   I *highly* doubt that this was some telling insight into the psyche of Eric Pickles and a concrete confirmation that he has no respect for sufferers of mental health problems, or considers them to be not worth listening to.

Crass?  Yes.  

Insensitive?  Yes.  

Stupid and should have known better?  Absolutely.  

Evidence that Eric Pickles has no regard for mental health issues and just feels that sufferers should be dismissed?  Yes, if you hate the Tories and have no scruples about making wild claims based on a single misguided remark, but I think pretty unlikely really.",0,1380468238,null,0,false,0,cchkqav,t3_1nd8v1,t1_cchkqav,t1_cchkjgw,null,1429304949,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,mg117,null,null,"Incorrect.
The reparations did not cause ""global debt"", the crash of wall street is the main culprit there. If the crash had never happened then Germany's financial situation, post-reparations, would have been relatively stable due to the financial aid manifested in such plans as the Young and Dawes plan. It was the combination of reparations but especially the events of the wall street crash that truly caused a problem in Germany. 

But without the reparations, Germany may well have continued the war a few years later. The German people famously didn't believe that they had been beaten, they saw their troops march back home through German lands that had never even come close to the front line, resulting in the emergent belief that Germany had been ""stabbed in the back"", in that Germany had been winning (or at least not losing) but the traitorous politicians had suddenly capitulated. 
Had Germany not been fined and its armed forces reduced to a fraction of what it had been, then it's entirely feasible to believe that Germany would have once again attempted aggressive actions a few years later; seeking revenge or closure of the first war. 

Finally, one can't have historical hindsight. If I had been a French or British politician at Versailles whose Son(s) had died in this war, I would have made damn sure that the country responsible would pay and pay dearly.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; No, Labour isn't entirely innocent - but it's the Tories who have always pushed the flawed ideology of privatization the hardest, 

To use your specific examples, Labour were very happy to have private involvement in the NHS and they were going to privatise Royal Mail. This makes them just as bad as the Conservatives (or good, depending on your opinion). You can't say that ""oh Labour are better because"", as they either did or planned to do the same thing.

&gt;  for its most disasterous failures (energy companies, and the railways - privatizing natural monopolies, really... as if that was ever going to end well...)

Labour had a golden opportunity to reverse rail privatisation at minimal cost. Almost all of the rail franchises expired during their time in power, they could simply have abandoned the tendering system and made it clear that a new British Rail would be taking it over as each contract expired. No need to compensate anyone. Why didn't they do this? What they did instead was finish the job (the last British Rail services ran after Labour took over) and kept the system in place. Railtrack (stations, track, signalling, infrastructure) was nationalised, but only after it made as big of a mess as possible, several years after Labour took office, and only after they tried to find a private buyer.

Energy would be harder but if we can piss away billions on ID cards, fire control centres, NHS IT and all of the other pointless wastes of money Labour gave us, we could have started to get it back.

You can blame the Conservatives for doing it, but you also have to blame Labour for continuing with it and not reversing it. 13 years is a long time to get stuff done.

&gt; But those will all pale in comparison to the destruction that could be brought upon the NHS :( (See US healthcare... we'll be looking at £500 for a pack of painkillers, tens of thousands to treat a broken bone, millions for anything really serious...

Our high pressing game in the first half, especially from Fer/Tettey/Howson who were all outstanding, meant Stoke had no time to get a passing game going, whereas ours was very fluent. Switching Redmond and Elmander for more defensively-minded players seems to have helped.

I still think we weren't direct enough, and we only had 3 shots inside the box the whole game (2 from one early corner). RvW also looked a bit pedestrian, especially in the air where he won only [17% of aerial battles](http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/719998/Live/England-Premier-League-2013-2014-Stoke-Norwich) (for comparison Kenwyne Jones won 38%). He didnt have one shot all game, although a few fouls he won helped us out of sticky situations. It will be good to see what Hooper can do when he finally gets a full game.

Thankfully the back 4 and the amazing midfield trio did enough to neutralise Stoke, and our defending on set pieces meant they barely threatened us at all. The ease of John Ruddy's performance compared to last week shows just that.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"&gt; I didn't actually say anything about the Tories or Eric Pickles' weight, though.

No, it's an example to illustrate a point.  That's why I said ""someone"" and not ""you"".

&gt;And as I said in my original comment, the intent does not matter. People can be unintentionally racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic etc. It still reinforces discriminatory practices in society.

I don't disagree.  Sadly though, a lot of people who would fall over themselves to join the ""fuck the tories"" circlejerk in a thread like this, often stay absolutely silent in the hundreds of threads on reddit every day that refer to people as ""faggots"" or ""gay"" as a derogatory term.  It's not that they are offended, or actually believe in the real meat of their argument.  It's just a chance to pin something on someone they don't like in a place where they're unlikely to get any comeback over it, because this sub is fairly rampantly anti-tory for the most part.

I'm only really making two points here:

1. No one actually knows Pickles' true views on mental health.  He made a stupid, crass, insensitive comment in the heat of the moment, and this may or may not indicate is actual feelings on the issue when a little more level headed.

2. A lot of people simply use these kinds of incidents for point scoring, and don't actually care about the issue either.  They just use it for their own ends to make political capital.  I'd argue this is just as bad.

That is all.  And on that note, it's rather late at night in my part of the world, so thank you for the discussion, and I bid you goodnight.",0,1380469706,null,0,false,0,cchl58j,t3_1nd8v1,t1_cchl58j,t1_cchkthy,null,1429304755,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

It would be very user based but I would have a policy of deleting listings after a week unless it was noted that the vacancy was still open. To start with I would be able to operate as a loan admin but one or two others would be beneficial.

Post titles would have to be (for text posts) (Example) ""Derby - Bar Staff Wanted"" and the top line of the post ""Derby - Littleover Area - Bar Staff - The Four Lions"" listing whether part time or full time, any requirements and application details. (For links) (Example) ""Derby - Littleover - Bar Staff Wanted - Part Time - The Four Lions"". The latter would be better for text posts as well.

If people were wanting to promote their own businesses ""Derby - Plasterer - Fully Qualified"" But I don't know yet if I would allow promotion of own businesses or ""Does anyone know of a good plasterer in the Ashbourne area?"" to start with in case the clogged up the page and made it difficult for users to see available jobs.

Good. Outstanding may be a stretch.

I'd like him to complete a 1 star pass, honestly. His touch has been woeful and for the amount of touches he's had in attacking areas, he has been wasteful.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"This isn't about foreign terrorists or criminals - every citizen in this country is entitled to those rights. Take them away from whatever boogyman you have in mind and you take away everyone's rights. 

I find it staggering that people/Conservatives seem unable to agree we should meet even the incredibly low bar that is set by the ECHR. That's basically what he's saying. He's come out, in public and said without shame that the UK is unable to rise to the standard of basic human rights (that are caveated to hell by the way). 

These are basic and universal rights like no torture, fair trials and privacy. These aren't just plucked out of the air to annoy politicians. If David Cameron has decided that those rights aren't important any more then he should say just that. What 'flexible' means in terms of a new law is, obviously, one that is weaker and more easily overruled by the government. 

I truly scares me that the government considers human rights (like fair trials and privacy) privileges that can be granted only when the government sees fit. If you aren't a good citizen then you don't get given those rights. The government is trying to effectively make itself the arbiter of what is to be acceptable behaviour for themselves. The very same people who would be held accountable by human rights law are deciding it's extend and strength. If you can't see the problem with that conflict of interests I can't help you. 

EDIT: To answer the question: Who else is going to decide that other than the government? 

This is why the ECHR works and has the potential of working better than it does. It's not simply at the whim of party politics despite it's weakness at actually forcing countries to enact it's rulings. This is why human rights law needs to stay at European level or even at an international/world level and with the UK judiciary. Any changes or reforms considered by any UK government should be done on a cross party basis with the assistance of non-partisan committees and advisers etc. No one party can be trusted to do this - it's of constitutional importance at a level greater than party politics.

true,SHOOPDAWOOPLOL,lfcflame,,"Positives:

* Played like shit and still won. That shows character and class, what top 4 teams have.

* Suarez: Back with a bang.

* The SAS are on fire.

* We created chances and scored 3 goals without Coutinho and very little link up between attack and defence.

* We defended well, Mignolet made some great saves, even though he made a few slip ups, too.

* We're 2nd in the league.

* We're 6 points clear of the mancs.

* WE SCORED IN THE SECOND HALF

* WE SCORED FROM A CORNER

Negatives:

* Lucas out for the next game

* Hendo wasn't great

* Mignolet's slip up led to the goal

* We were on the ropes for a while against a team with -10 goal difference and 1 point so far.

* We sat too deep and didn't press

* There was no link up between defence and attack.

First of all, I thought Sakho was outstanding today, it's still going to take some time for him to come to terms with the speed of the Preimiership but I think it's going to be a fantastic signing. He really reminds me of Hyppia in his early days. Was really impressed with his distribution today. I remember against Swans, I was a bit scared of it as he doesn't like hoofing it, even when it's needed. I think it's because he looks so damn unnatural on the ball, but it comes off!

Now the Hendo topic. I am going to love this formation I think, and it is PERFECTLY suited for GJ and JE. Hendo is not a wingback, let alone a winger. I know he's played most of his games there, but when he plays outwide, he plays more as a right sided midfielder, and not a winger. In this position, he can't cut inside, otherwise we lose our whole shape. Yes he was wasteful sometimes in the final delivery, but he did have a few decent deliveries. It was his positional play, which stretched the Sunderland defence, allowing the space for Suarez Sturridge and Moses. Our players obviously have a lot of confidence in him, as they were never shying away from giving him the ball. He was also very good defensively, and obviously I don't need to talk about his workrate. Obviously he wasn't one of the best players on the pitch, but in no way was he shocking, and just because he had a handful of wasted crosses, means he was shit.

Moses, again good but I can't help but think he is an out and out powerful winger, and not sure if he's really great playing behind the front 2. But again he's filling in for Cou, and did play well.

1. Skrtel has been immense so far. Kolo is pretty good as well, though i don't think he did as well as people make him out to be. He made a couple of errors.
2. Sakho is a physical colossus. If he improves his reading of the game, he'll be world class.
3. Sturridge-Suarez is a world class partnership. Both play off each other so well.
4. Mig-no-let in goals. That is all.

On the negative side

1. Gerrard/Lucas are like two turtles in the center. They don't cover enough ground or close down players fast enough. Gerrard distributes the ball well, but has cost us at least a couple of goals with his tired performances

2. We can't seem to deal with teams pressing us. Our passing rhythm was so much better last season and its really bewildering to see us lose that. The reason why our results have been so positive is all credit to our immense defensive play.

If he's not the actual 10th doctor, that would be such an insult to the fans that the backlash could kill the series.

It will simply be the 10th Doctor and Rose and the events of the 50th take place between one of the known episodes.

&gt;If you think about it

Only if you want to kill the show.

&gt;If you think about it, it makes sense. Rose is coming back after it being said that that would be impossible 

But this will be her past self, not the current one.

&gt;That, plus the fact that ""Clone Doctor"" and 11 can touch. If it were David Tennant, they would't be able to because of all the crossing timelines and touching former and future self.

On the other hand some economies which are attempting Tory-type austerity are really down the pan; Greece desperately needs some stimulus spending to protect its exporting industries because there simply isn't any more spending to cut without scaling back vital services or causing mass unemployment/inflation (although I admit Greece's corruption problems make this a tough nut to crack).

Just like Norway then? There is almost only American shows on television. Adding to that we have adopted large amounts of American culture.

&gt; Couple that with the state of British society - the gutter press, trashy media, nanny state, fearmongering and trecharous big government, paedophile hysteria, terrible education, declining NHS, impossible to get on the property ladder etc etc etc.

- You will find thrashy media here aswell. 

- Norway is the perfect example of a nanny state. Everything that is fun is either illegal or taxed hard. 

- The public sector in Norway is one of the largest in the world, One third of all employees work in the public sector. In other words, one hell of a bureaucracy.

- We do horrible in international school rankings with no top universities. Schools are in bad shape with 8 out of 10 schools having a bad inside climate.

- Health sector is filled with flaws and long queues. Private health insurance is on a very steep rise.

- The real estate market in Norway is ridiculous. In Oslo you have no chance in hell in owning an apartment on a regular wage. Rent is very high. My friend rents a small apartment, more of a room really, and pays around 875 pounds a month. If you want a loan you need 15% equity. In other words you must save a lot of money when property prices in most areas starts at over 300 000 pounds!

- In the end, the weather is only good for 4 months per year. Very dark and misrable winters.

Don't believe everything is better on the other side. Also you have no chance of getting a job here without speaking Norwegian. The only option you have if you want to speak english is oil and gas engineering.

The scheme is pretty clever really. The people renting the houses will even have more money, since mortgage payments are typically less than rent payments for the same property.

Two of my friends are planning to use the scheme. Their current rent is £800/month which they afford comfortably, but the mortgage would only be around £550 on the same place.

I think a reason people can point to Sandi Toksvig as a funny woman comedian is because she is a bit butch or straight-faced and isn't emblematic of a funny female comedian. Meanwhile, Ronni Ancona is exactly that and I don't think she's funny.

What makes this all the more frustrating for me is that I *do* like Sandi almost always: the exception was this last episode when she starting bringing up the suppression of women *over and over*. But I'm not allowed to say that wasn't funny because I am a man and it was precisely for feminist reasons why I didn't find her funny, as it so happens.

Bear in mind that, as I said in the post you replied to, renting is often more expensive than a mortgage. I heard recently that a mortgage is around 2/3 the cost of renting after you've put down a 20% deposit.

For my friends' example, they can afford their rent of £800/month, so making a mortgage payment of £550/month is no problem at all. It would take a pretty hefty interest rate increase to take them back to £800, and a crazy increase to put them significantly above that. 

Also, the decreased would allow people to save. So if the interest rates do go up significantly, people will have lump sums saved that can pay it off.

And as I mentioned in another post, this would be the case for anybody buying a house now. Rates are very low and everybody knows it, so whether you use 'help to buy' or not, everybody knows their repayments will probably go up in the future. That doesn't make the scheme worthless.

It was also confusing to me when I was told, I questioned it myself and this was all I got.

Far as I was told, they own half of the property. Literally sounds like a 50/50 split, but yes, they pay rent to stay as its not actually theirs.

Maybe there's some crossed wires, but like I said, I questioned it because it sounded weird, I've never personally rented or owned any property by myself and it still didn't sound right tbh.

They rent from an individual who owned the property, but apparently its partly theirs like they've paid for it somewhat.

They have been there for 5 years, none of this is recent.

Once the estate is out of money the creditors may attempt to coerce your GF into making further payments, but under no circumstances should she do this.  Any remaining debt will be written off, there is no way responsibility can be passed to her.

However, her mother giving away the house in an attempt to keep it from the creditors won't work - they would get a court order to have the change of ownership set aside and the house would have to be sold to pay the debt.  

The only way that they'll be able to keep the house is if your GF can get a mortgage to purchase the house at a fair market value - again if she were to attempt to purchase it for significantly less the creditors would look to get the purchase set aside.  From the information you've given, it seems like this would not be possible.

Does her mother have a will?  If not she should get one made up ASAP, and ensure that she appoints an executor for her estate to deal with all the legal stuff including the payment of the debts.

She should also look to sort out the custody arrangements for the younger children - if your GF wants to be responsible for them this should be in writing, just in case social services decides to get involved after her mother passes away.

Lastly, if your GF is going to be looking after her siblings she should start looking at how much help she'll be able to get in terms of benefits for housing etc.  These things can take several weeks to get sorted out and for the payments to start, so advance preparation will make it just that little bit easier when the time comes.

While house prices have been cheaper historically, mortgage rates were higher and so repayments probably took a larger % of your income than they would now.

Admittedly, London is out of control, and that is a little bit of a bubble but that's because it is a major city and foreign owners are buying lots of properties there, coupled with insane demand to live in London.

If we don't have this scheme, more people will be in the rental trap, more people will never obtain ownership, and a smaller number of people with houses to rent out will continue to make even more money. Those things seem overall bad for the whole market. This scheme allows people to buy, but also frees up the rental market, hopefully bringing rents down, which seems good for the whole market and not just individuals.

I don't see the government as propping up the market at all. They're simply helping younger people to enter it. The market is doing pretty well all by itself.

I have come to loath being defined by others in this manner.   I am not part of the ""all Irish People"" also I'm not ""Northern Irish"" I’m also not 100% British or 100% Irish.  I am however 100% hacked off by Nationalist politicians who think that I’m simply an Irishman who is wrong about being British (i.e. the SDLP approach).   I hate Flegs and “Fleg Protestors” and Red White and Blue painted curb stones.  I hate Tricolours and the offensive use of Irish language to designate “our” areas, I hate the IRA/UVF/CIRA/UFF/SF and the rest of those f**kers.    I can’t stand the narrow minded religious bigotry of the DUP.   I think that in foisting segregated education on our children that the Catholic Church is as deeply to blame for the sectarian divide as the Orange Order is.  I hate sectarian graffiti and stupid wall end art that revels and gloats in inherited “hurts” of long ago.   I may be “hun” but I don’t see why anybody should want to kill me!

Does this rant make any sense, probably not?   In the end I suppose that I’m fed up with instability, I want peace.  This idea is yet another destabilising symbolic gesture that’s like a dog pissing on a lamp post to mark its territory; I really don’t want that dog peeing on my front door (again)

Not by switching to generic drug equivalents or terminating their overpriced catering or maintenance contracts.

The is a fundamental culture problem in the NHS that needs changing, starting from the top.

In a time of economic downturn (where our country could easily have gone bankrupt like Cyprus) the NHS (and all other departments) have to improve through increasing efficiency - there just simply isn't enough money to go around.  We can not keep increasing the deficit for ever, let alone allow the rate at which the deficit is increasing to go up!

As a side note, the government rarely decides where exactly to make budget cuts.  They cut a broad regional budget and the local authority decides how that is achieved.

People ARE buying houses. House buying activity is high right now. So they clearly aren't overpriced. Central London is arguably the only place where there is an actual bubble (i.e. people for investment because they think the price will go up, thus driving prices up higher).

The problem isn't that nobody is buying. It's that many normal first time buyers are effectively shut out because their savings are not great enough to put down a deposit.

&gt;The scheme is invalid simply because it shouldn't be the business of government to underwrite any person's debt or to involve itself in propping up the property market.

I do agree with that on principle. But there isn't much alternative, apart from leaving first time buyers who don't have parental help trapped in rent forever.

From what I have read, there isn't much evidence at all that houses are currently overpriced. Just because they are unaffordable to newcomers to the market doesn't mean they are actually overpriced, as long as somebody somewhere is buying.

true,BFG_9000,cnty-uk,Grimsby,"I originally found this on reddit - although a quick search yielded no results - I think it was titled ""**Breakfast - Done Properly*""  
 
1. Wake up in a Georgian country house with a hangover of biblical proportions. Slide your arm from beneath the slender alabaster neck of the recumbent debutante and silently pick your way through the detritus of last night's party to the kitchen. 
 
 
2. As soft golden sunlight arcs low across the paddock and gilds the chromework of the Aga like melted butter, find a big pan. 
 
 
3. Heat an unconscionable quantity of oil to a gentle simmer and slip in the freshly made local sausages. Sausages should not be pricked and never fried. The intention is that they should poach in the oil. 
 
 
4. As the sausages poach make tea. If it is a proper farmhouse there will be a gigantic 'Brown Betty' teapot of the type used to fortify British battalions throughout the last Great Unpleasantness. Add a spoonful of leaf tea (need we mention the sordid subject of bags?) for each person and 'one for the pot'. At this point the kettle will start its song, beginning the process of gently awakening the recovering partygoers. Pour the water over the leaves. The tea serves the same purpose to a hungover Englishman that chicken soup serves to a Jewish New Yorker with a headcold and hives. This is not cooking...it's an emergency clinical intervention. An Englishman's mother will offer him tea as first response medical aid even if his arm has been severed by a combine harvester. 
 
 
5. Move the sausages to the warming oven, pour off all but a light glazing of the oil and begin to brown the bacon. Much has been written about good bacon and I do not propose to repeat it. Suffice it to say...smoked...streaky...thin...crisp. Place in the warming oven when done. 
 
 
6. Open a can of Heinz baked beans -accept no substitute- these are not so much a foodstuff as an architectural element of the finished plate. Think of beans as colour and a concealer of disheartening flashes of empty plate between meats. 
 
 
7. Mushrooms and tomatoes may be grilled at this stage but no gentleman would consider eating them. They are vegetables. Vegetables are a form of table decoration. They aren't food - they go next to food. As the great Dr Johnson should have said 'Vegetables are what food eats' and I have no intention of disagreeing. 
 
 
8. Americans eat hash browns at breakfast. Theay are disagreeable to an Englishman. I understand that the French, who can make food out of almost anything, use them to sole espadrilles. 
 
 
9. There are many different ways to cook eggs but most of them are purely of interest to invalids, children and the feeble-minded. The correct or 'proper English egg' is fried with lightly browned edges in the fat left over from the bacon. At the last minute, oil is flicked over the top of the yolk to seal it. This dangerous procedure causes the yolk to form a perfect, golden, viscid capsule, the violation of which with a rough shard of toast, is the nearest that an Englishman will permit himself to unbridled sexual ecstasy. 
 
 
10. While the eggs are being coaxed into tumescence the first of the walking wounded will have arrived in the kitchen. Ignore the bashful looks and tousled hair and administer tea in large quantities. Mugs enable fingers to thaw and many a tryst has been sealed by a coy glance over the chipped china rim. The more robust may be set to the simple task of toast. 
 
 
11. Working quickly, lay down toast, top with an egg, flank with bacon and sausage and fill the spaces with beans. Serve forth.",0,1380493037,null,0,false,0,ccht851,t3_1necyy,t1_ccht851,t3_1necyy,null,1429300913,78,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,78

Also I was talking just last week with someone about the effect of Article 6 (fair trials) on particularly financial regulation but also may companies' disciplinary processes. The FSA used to simply fine companies that did wrong by having a meeting behind closed doors, giving no-one a voice or a defence and coming up with a figure. Since the HRA and the application of Article 6 to all quasi-judicial procedures the FSA had to rewrite it's process for fining companies who broke regulations - they had to give them a fair trial.
