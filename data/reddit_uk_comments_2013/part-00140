I support Mainz, as that is my hometown. 

The TL;DR is that Liverpool fans on the internet give off this vibe of entitlement, that the club 'belongs' in the upper echelons of European football, that players should feel honored to play for the club, and that the best players in the world would want to join the club. Players who would want to join Liverpool are actually those who are either underappreciated (in the case of Mignolet, who is hoping that playing for a higher profile club might help him regain the Belgian goalkeeper spot over Courtois), unwanted at their clubs (Sturridge, Coutinho and Luis Alberto, who wasn't offered a contract as part of the loan deal by Barcelona), or came with PR problems (Suarez, who was serving an 8 match ban for biting, and Aspas, who was suspended for headbutting). Granted, young talent players might want to join Liverpool, but usually for first team time which they can't get at better clubs.

There is no way a player of his caliber would choose to come to Pool this window with the absence of European, let alone UCL, football so why sell him? As far as I am concerned he can waste his prime years on the bench or go MIA and not play any football at all. 

I cannot think of another sport where the players can bitch and moan until they are allowed out of their legally binding contracts.  For example, in the NFL players sometimes refuse to play until they get a better contract but in no instance has a player ever complained about how much he hates his team until management moves him to a championship contender.  I know you can point out that there are only 32 teams in the NFL but how many football teams can afford the wages, facilities, and complete team that can compete for a UEFA Championship? Not too many.

International law is effectively a treaty system, and there are few legal precedants to determine how sucession would work in this situation. If you think Salmond can run crying to the UN to make them force the UK to do what he wants, your're very mistaken. For one thing the UN generally takes decades to reach decisions in these sorts of cases and both parties have to willingly agree to it, and those decisions almost always retain the least-objectionable status-quo... So the Scots might even find they come out of any such forced negotiation less well off.

To use this specific case as an example - while the geographical proximity of the oil fields may be Scottish, the well heads, the rigs, the exploration costs etc. were born out with money from London. One possibility is that the Scots could ""own"" the oil fields (for domestic political point scoring) -- but then make some kind of percentage reimbursment payment to the UK in acknowledgement of the joint development of the industry.

**The bottom line is this**: We all share North sea oil at the moment. If the 5 million people in Scotland take it all, then the remaining 57 million in the UK will have less... so the Scots are deluded if they think their fledgling inexperienced and unestablished government is going to somehow preferentially negotiate away the wealth of a country 10 times their size with arguably the most well established diplomatic organisation anywhere in the world.

It has nothing to do with thinking a woman couldn't hold her own, or that there shouldn't be more credible female role-models in sci-fi (because there definitely SHOULD be). It comes down to our connection to the established character - yes, he changes from time-to-time, but his core traits remain the same, and this helps create sense of constancy, that even though the actor has left, this is still the same person we know and love. The problem is, a person's gender is often the very first thing we unconsciously judge when we  see them, even before we process information on race or any other trait. To our animal brains, I think, it would be too fundamental a change for us to easily buy in the idea of it being the same person, regardless of what our higher principles might tell us about it making no difference.

Honestly, I can't say that always it is. When my boyfriend and I were looking at places to live, we found a lot of houses in rural areas that had a big initial payoff but cost less in the long-term cost comparative to London. For the same price as a small cottage in a village, we could have rented a one bedroom flat. 


&gt;So people choosing not to,

Some people can't live in the city, health, maybe they have a family home in the country they live in at a reduced price, maybe the nature of their work means they have to live in rural areas (eg, farmers). But just like some people can't get out of their current situation in the city, some people in rural areas can just up and decide to move to a city. 


The point of paying taxes is to make sure we all get a basic standard of living in the UK. As long as the post is government controlled, the idea is that everyone gets reasonable access to it. I am with you, there's no way that it makes sense for someone out in the sticks should get the same frequency of mail delivery as someone in the city.

I certainly agree with your thought that BA should be looking up to improve rather than down to stay ahead. But alas, I think there will always have to be a middle airline. When you look at some budget airlines and compare it to BA's route to the same destination the price difference is not that great (I suppose depending on how far you book in advance). Especially if you have the added inconvenience of having to go to Luton, so for those sorts of flights I think BA ought to win more people than they do. Simply because they're not marketed as a budget airline doesn't mean they're not competitive. Although if Lufthansa and Swiss are only a tad more expensive than them then I suppose it's where you draw the line (depending on whether your destination will have those airlines).

Anyway I'm running through random points in my own head that don't really seem to add anything. I don't really think it would be that hard for BA to raise their game to at least compete with Virgin's first and business but they don't seem that willing to do so.

""Murder"" means the intentional killing of someone.  It seems unlikely that the police actually intended to kill him, so it's not murder.

I think that the very worst term you could use is ""voluntary manslaughter"".  i.e. that the police maliciously intended to cause serious harm as an afterthought.

As to socialism, it's a rather broad term and it's not at all fanciful, the UK's political system until recently had elements of socialism to it such as a free health service and benefits that redistribute a fraction of the wealth to those who need it. 

A country like Denmark is a bit more socialist. Venezuela is socialist and I think Bolivia and Ecuador are socialist or maybe socialistic. Cuba is socialist still and is an example of how a cooperative approach can be useful in overcoming adversity.

This is despite the fact that (arguably) capital spending could increase the productivity of the post office and provide a more efficient service.

By floating it on the stock market, they are giving the Royal Mail access to the sources of external investment capital that other business have available to them.  People will happily invest if they believe that this investment will go towards capital infrastructure spending that will show a return in the future.  We would then see a more efficient service and (theoretically) lower prices.

Of course, I don't have much faith that this benefit in productivity will actually be passed on to the consumer, and it would almost certainly mean fewer postmen working and lower wages for those employed.

1. We are at cross-purposes and are misunderstanding each other.

2. You are cunningly using the Socratic Method.

3. You haven't thought this through.

4. You are a making a racist comment that you actually believe.

5. You are trolling.

6. Some other reason.

Point 1: My original comment was sarcasm about the law of unintended consequences. In the moral panic about immigration governments make new rules and people applaud them assuming that they will only apply to other people, in this case ""black people"", not nice white people. It is a bit like quite a few people that I have interviewed who thought that benefits were generous, easy to claim and that those that did claim were scroungers. When it came to their turn to claim they were in for a shock. They thought that they were the right sort of people and that they should get what they would deny other people.

Points 2 - 6: Yes, I would find the comment that blacks are ""native to Nigeria and Africa"" dodgy, when it is linked to ""Whites are indigenous to Europe. They should be allowed freely move about their own continent."" That is because it suggests that non-whites have less rights based on skin colour and is also logically inconsistent. I will stick with your term 'black' here, I originally had in mind Asian friends whose parents were also born here, but lets keep it simple.

Firstly, it is not factually correct. People defined as black are descended from people from a number of areas, including Australia. 

I am also unsure where continents fits in with this. We are talking about the right to move in and out of a political entity, not a broad geographical area. As such we are talking about membership of a political community. If by your argument all whites are one and can roam freely across our great continent, ignoring local political rules, are you also suggesting that Ukrainians can vote here from the Ukraine? It is the same logic.

You are classifying people on the colour of their skin, which is only one dimension in their political and national identity, and to say that someone has worse or better rights based just on colour is racist, whether you intend that or not. Let's look at a few examples:

Are you suggesting that a white Australian whose parents have never been here has more right to move to the UK than a black person born in the UK from UK parents? That seems to be your suggestion. How about a white with Chilean parents that grew up in Australia and now wants to move freely about the UK? More rights than the black Brit? How about a mixed-race Australian with one black parent and one white? What if they have a funny accent? Still more rights than the black Brit? It is a pretty absurd idea isn't it?

Legally the Royal Navy is only allowed to build warships within the UK; if Scotland succeeds can the industry remain there? The second carrier isnât due for completion until 2020, and the only drydocks big enough to service them through their 50-year lifespan are in Rosyth. The UK would likely have to lease these bases too.

But if Scotland wants to retain a portion of the UKâs armed forces; its aircraft and planes, the proportional share it would get may be too small to field a full squadron of fighters, or be economical to maintain independent support and training systems from the UK. The armed forces would likely have to remain linked for another decade or two, and slowly separated over that period.

Letters are a shrinking market and not profitable, in order for Royal Mail to be/remain successful it needs to invest in infrastructure to deal with parcel delivery as good as or better than the competitors that are biting at it's heels. I personally wouldn't trust the government to hand over billions of pounds of taxpayers money to attempt this. I much prefer the idea of private people/institutions willing to risk their money over the tax payer.

If the privatization is successful for Royal mail, we as a country will still benefit, much like we benefit from the innovation and strategic changes of British Telecom and the global growth of and tax money from British Petroleum. The easy access to private capital could potentially fund acquisitions, research and development and new services never considered under the current model. 

The people who will benefit most from this being successful are obviously the new shareholders. The reality is that most of these shareholders are not fat greedy men in suits licking their lips and throwing millions of pounds to take a punt of royal mail being successful. A large chunk will go to the workers, the rest will be likely be taken up by institutions. These institutions are mainly insurance companies, pension funds and banks. When these institutions make profitable investments, the general public often benefits, i.e insurance premiums lower, pensions offer better returns or close their gaping deficits and banks are better capitalized and able to lend more. The individuals that get rich from these are such a small proportion of where the total distribution of this money goes that it is irrelevant. If you have a million pounds to gamble on royal mail shares, you have a million other options to increase your wealth through investments, many of which are a lot safer.

See [How the Dutch got their cycle paths](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o) to see how, in fact, cycling infrastructure and buildings were *removed* to accommodate *cars* as levels of wealth and car use increased after WWII. Even today, in the Netherlands and Copenhagen one strategy to reduce congestion is to reduce the amount of space for cars (a so-called ""road diet"") and increasing the space for cycling and walking. We could do the same, but choose not to. Cars take up disproportionate amounts of room, so the idea there is ""no room for cycling"" is down to the [over-prioritisation of cars](http://road.cc/content/news/86127-future-britain%E2%80%99s-transport-more-roads), especially in London where (in some boroughs) [more people cycle than use a car](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/hackney-is-top-for-cyclists-with-more-using-bikes-than-car-8474521.html).

As for that old canard about hills in the UK: I mentioned this to a Dutchman once, and he said something like ""I'd prefer the hills to the kind of wind we get at home."" Ask any cyclist: most of them will say that hills are just part of the deal but a headwind is a killer. Even then, electric bikes are available for people who don't want to peddle hard and get sweaty, so I'm not buying into this idea that ""we're not a cycling nation because hills."" [We once *were* a cycling nation](http://www.roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com/), and the topology was very much the same as today. We're not a cycling nation because our politicians, and many of us too, are obsessed with cars.

So, frankly - I agree with you. We should be more realistic about what we can do in London to accommodate cyclists, and we need to do far, far more than the limited, blinkered aspirations we have today. More people are cycling, many more want to cycle, and it's just the poor infrastructure and oblivious attitudes from our ""leaders"" which leaves us trailing other, more enlightened and realistic countries.",0,1373537151,null,0,false,0,cb0cg5h,t3_1i03h8,t1_cb0cg5h,t1_cb02k22,null,1430507636,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Over time, we've learned not to be so hostile to people from the next set of caves, the neighbouring villages, neighbouring towns and cities, even from other counties.

&gt;A cross-sectional survey design was employed with an opportunity sample of 200 full- and
part-time students recruited from 29 universities in the UK. The majority of these
institutions were from London (11) and the South of England (10), with others drawn from
Wales, East Anglia and the North of England (8). These included a number of both pre-
(13) and post-1992 (16) universities. A majority of the respondents (N = 171, 85.5%)
were drawn from post-1992 universities. Recruitment occurred through a social science
departmental participation pool in the first instance, by approaching students in a variety of
different social areas of the university campus, including the Studentâs Union buildings,
libraries and a specific social room situated in one of the university buildings. Respondents
were also recruited via social media (Facebook and Twitter) and via snowballing. Women
comprised 62.5% of the sample (N = 125, mean age = 22.32 years [SD = 4.67]) and
men 37.5% (n = 75, mean age = 22.88 years [SD = 3.73]). Undergraduates comprised
89% of the sample (N = 178). The sample predominantly comprised those in full-time
education (n = 195, 97.5%). Participants completed a semi-structured questionnaire,

So ironically, by voting for independence and a greater say in their affairs - Scots would actually get a UK sovereign base inside their exterior border, where nuclear weapons were kept, and Scots politicians would not have any say over the use of those weapons in a time of conflict.

But the answer I'd give to your question is to move to an electrical economy through temporary increased use of nuclear power to take up the shortfall slack (and yeah, sure Greenpeace disagrees with this, but that's a different discussion) and then phasing in renewable sources of energy like wind and wave and solar power whilst slowly closing down the nuclear plants.

This isn't exactly a new idea and there are countless ways to do it. It's not like it's something that can't be done within current limitations on technology and resources. The problem is the wealth and lobbying power and dishonesty of the existing fossil fuel industry.

There is no question that there are enough renewable sources of energy to meet the entire planet's needs even without population reduction. What's lacking is the will to go ahead with its use.

The guy got tased and some point later on died. I think the policeman was just trying to be careful not to jump to conclusions with the little information they had. Personally I think you're reading too much into the wording. When most people get tased and don't die, yet one person does die from it, I think there's little wrong in saying it's a freak accident, even if the taser is what caused it.

Did you know, for example, that before police officers are issued tasers they themselves have to be tasered so they can understand what it's like?  I think that helps develop respect for the weapon. At any rate police have many things they could potentially abuse the public with, I'd much rather they tried things like a taser in handling a criminal than using a firearm.

I thought that the First World War was so tragic because so many died due to such distant and irrelevant circumstances to them. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent alliance chains that followed.

 The idea that Germany wanted to dominate Europe, wasn't as far as I know why they invaded Belgium which is what brought the UK into the war, but rather because the German plan in the event of a two front war with Russia and France, France would need to be attacked quickly and defeated before Russia could mobilize properly. 

I kind of agree that the remembrance shouldn't just be about defeats and the like, but it would be a lie to suggest that there was really a good  guys team and a bad guys team, one fighting for democracy and freedom, the other fighting for domination, though admittedly you could bring up things like the Armenian Genocide taking place within the Ottoman Empire and various other things like German colonial policy and the way Poles were regarded, but thatâs more just pointing fingers and saying âThey were worse thoughâ, given the size and policy of the British, French and Russian Empires at the time.

Bank in Brindley Place was another great eat. Went on Valentines Day but service and food were both great. Cost about Â£80 for 3 courses and drinks but that was a few years back.

Cielo is an Italian restaurant in Brindley Place which was nice, not as nice as the other two but from what I can remember it was cheaper.

If you fancy a curry I can recommend Asha's just off Colmore Row. Best curry I've had. Meat was incredibly tender and probably the best curry I've had. Fairly pricey compared to what I'd normally pay for a curry but well worth it.

That's the expensive, now less so.

Old Contemptibles is a pub near Snow Hill that does really good food for a decent price.

Slug and Lettuce in Brindley Place, again good food for a decent price.

As for things to do, there is a food festival between 11 -7 on Friday and Saturday in the city centre. It will have stalls from some of the restaurants I mentioned above. The website is [here](http://colmorebusinessdistrict.com/cbd-food-festival-2013/) so check it out.

I'll leave others to give suggestions on things to do as I'm drawing a blank right now even though there is tons of stuff in and near the city centre.

Yes, taking black market ecstasy is more dangerous than a theoretical situation in which I could take legal, quality controlled pure MDMA, but it's still not *that* dangerous, so I still do it. Eating dinner would be safer if I liquidated all my food before consuming, but the fact that there exists a safer way of doing something doesn't effect the position of the normal way in relation to the risk/reward barrier, if that makes any sense? I know I am probably not explaining myself clearly, but it all makes sense in my head. Basically, risk of death on it's own is not a good enough reason to not do something, illegality is not a good enough reason to do something, and just because thing A is safer than thing B, it doesn't necessarily mean that thing B is too dangerous. Plus, if you avoid doing something which is dangerous because it is illegal, and one of the major justifications for keeping it illegal is that it is dangerous, then in way you are validating the flawed reasoning which allows the vicious circle to arise. If I was a lawmaker with no personal familiarity with drug use, and I saw that people were dying from taking illegal drugs, I didn't have any data on how dangerous the same drugs would be if they were legal, and that people were not taking drugs because they knew the risks, I wouldn't change anything.

The actual area I linked to (Schiebroek) was built mostly in the 1950s, so it would make sense that the idea predates the 1970s. They do love their roads in the Netherlands, and because Rotterdam is a relatively modern city (becoming wealthy from the vast oceanic port they have), they have enormous roads throughout the city as well as all over the country.

&gt;Even today, in the Netherlands and Copenhagen one strategy to reduce congestion is to reduce the amount of space for cars (a so-called ""road diet"") and increasing the space for cycling and walking.

There's a great poster which has a comparison between cars, public transport, cycling and walking which really conveys how much room cars take up on the road. I don't think many people willingly choose to drive in London but sometimes it's convenient (especially when moving large objects). Which brings me on to another point your link mentions: Have you ever tried parking in Hackney / Southwark / Lambeth? There are yellow lines *everywhere*. I think more people would drive if parking at the other end wasn't an exercise in futility. I personally don't like this approach because it's all stick and no carrot.

I don't think that book is a particularly good example given that the automobile was only invented in 1886 and was significantly slower than even a poor quality bicycle. We cycled because there was no real alternative - Horses were very expensive and where do you keep one if you live in a town? :) Cars *were* a fantastic idea just after the war when the population was significantly lower, petrol was cheap and the cars themselves relatively expensive.

&gt;The whole point of owning something whether that be a phone, car or B&amp;B is that it gives you exclusive control over who can use it right?

I think it's a mistake to see ownership in such absolute terms. I 'own' my cat, this doesn't give me the freedom to do what I like with it. We have to balance ownership with our responsibilities as citizens. I only use this extreme example to point out that there are justifiable limitations in our concept of private ownership. 

In this sense, the B&amp;B owner and the church owner are partially wrong to discriminate as they have done so purely on the basis of sexuality. Whether this warrants court action/new laws is a subjective matter, the judges in this instance have their own opinion. I'm undecided myself as I'm always uncomfortable with the idea of needlessly legislating, but it's interesting to play the devil's advocate.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; There will be no negotiation about removal of nuclear weapons after independence - they will be gone.

Don't be so sure. An easy work around is for the base to remain Sovereign UK territory on a lease from the Scots, potentially similar to the way Hong Kong was leased by treaty.

The simple truth is this: The UK cannot afford to relocate trident within 2 years (nor would it be possible to construct a replacement in that timeframe) -- neither can the Scots afford to fund such a move. However, the USA and EU isn't going to allow Scotland to force the remainder of the UK to unilaterally disarm overnight. More likely those interested parties will apply pressure to ensure some compromise is met that allows the rest of the UK time to transition to a UK base.
 
My guess is the base would become sovereign UK territory on a 50 year lease, with a commitment in treaty to remove nuclear weapons (and perhaps nuclear waste material) during that period. After that it will become a jointly run NATO base between the UK and Scotland, similar to the anglo-spanish base at Gibraltar. This is because the UK will need Faslane to rapidly deny Russian access to the Atlantic if needed, since the Scots won't have an adequate anti-submarine capability. This will be a major concern to the US who will campaign HARD to ensure the base remains open to the UKs military... and we all know how persuassive the US can be when it wants.",0,1373542980,null,0,1373543267,0,cb0da7j,t3_1i17w5,t1_cb0da7j,t1_cb01c7k,null,1430507243,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,qwerty321456,null,null,"I agree that WWII is probably more ingrained in the national consciousness with things like the blitz and the Nazis basically being the simplest embodiment of bad guys in recent history. I think it's much easier to look at in terms of good and bad than WWI is, whether you think it's correct to look at any history in that sense is another matter. You could argue that Remembrance Day was originally based around WWI and the poppy pin being a based on what grew the battle fields that were disturbed by the trenches and shelling and such makes it more prominent but I wouldnât agree.

As for how difficult WWI is to explain I think it depends mostly upon how deep you want to go with it. Each country had its own reasons for the alliances it made and the military and political situation it was in. you could just explain it as a Royal family member of a country got assassinated and went to war with the country it happened in and various alliances brought in everyone else. It's not particularly detailed or explanative, but it's not untrue either. In the same way you could explain WWII from the UKs perspective as we had an alliance with Poland, Germany invaded Poland, we went to war with Germany. It's true but not really an explanation. 

The ultimatums and war plans at the beginning of WWI are, for me, one of the better ways to understand each countries position. It's too much to really go into here but things like the ""Stop at Belgrade"" plan for the Austro-Hungarian army that never happened, the Schlieffen plan being so meticulous in its railway timetable that stopping it once it had started largely meant the abandonment of the plan, or at least that's the way some the German top brass saw it. The telegrams sent between Nicolas II and Kaiser Wilhelm before war was declared. It's what I like about history, it's as deep as much as you want to look into it.

Certainly its not fair (not sure what efficiency has to do with anything: its more *efficient* than regional English parliaments, but less democratic)

But its worth point out we live in a system where a government gets a convincing majority with around 38% of the vote. The Labour opposition needs only 34% of the vote to win a majority at the next election, WITHOUT counting the Scottish seats.

This is not an especially fair political system, and there are VASTLY greater democratic deficits than the small number of Scottish, Welsh and NI MPs being less accountable than the others. It IS a problem, but its pretty small beer, especially when we consider that those MPs DO have some stake in most of the issues at question, and also tend not to vote on them most of the time.

Yes, love their cars too so I don't think anything in the ""Go Dutch"" campaign in the UK is intrinsically ""anti-car"", it's just about balance. I love the idea that cities could be made more user-friendly, and I daresay most motorists would agree once they saw the results. Even Clarkson waxed lyrical recently about Copenhagen, before reverting to type and rejecting more [""cycling in Britain, because here cycling is a ""political statement"" and cyclists all have beards""](http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/world-to-end-clarkson-joins-twitter-praises-cycling/012865). (Apparently Top Gear is really popular in the Netherlands as well.)

&gt; Have you ever tried parking in Hackney / Southwark / Lambeth?

I used to stay with a friend in SW London, and parking near his house was a nightmare, so I can only imagine. Driving is necessary for some journeys and some people (i.e. who physically cannot use alternatives) but, let's face it, most of our cities are at (or near) capacity now and it's only pragmatic to look at the alternatives. As someone said, if the bicycle were invented today it would be seen as a miracle solution. As it is, it's seen as a bit naff and impractical, at least by decision-makers.

I'm not sure the book is the best example (I probably ought to read it before using it to make a point) but here's a bit of anecdata for you: my mother grew up in Portsmouth, and her father worked in the docks - this would have been in the 50s and 60s. She said that when the whistle blew at knocking-off time, ""you stood out of the way"" as thousands of men took to their bikes and peddled home (or down to the pub, just as likely). So it once was a form of mass transport (at least in Portsmouth!) even if most of us did decide (in the 70s) that we preferred cars. 

Anyway, I suppose we're vigorously agreeing with each other! Thanks for taking the time to engage, and do visit /r/ukbike if you're interested in UK cycling.

BTW, the only thing I strongly disagree with is your final paragraph. Mandatory helmet use (and indeed licensing and insurance) reduces the overall numbers of people cycling, and (as an indirect consequence) probably leads to more deaths from preventable diseases like obesity and heart disease. It also makes bike hire schemes very impractical, since who wants to hire a sweaty, used helmet when they hire a bike? There is also a long-running debate (which I hope *not* to rekindle here) about the overall efficacy of helmets. Listen to [Mikael Colville-Andersen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07o-TASvIxY) of Copenhagenize for a full run-down on this issue.

true,Lokopopz,lfc99,,"1). Down south (Wiltshire), but I go to Uni in Ormskirk (about 30 mins away from Liverpool centre)


2.) I started watching football in the 09/10 season. (The season after we came 2nd...) But that drop from 2nd to 7th. Was a little hard to take as a new fan.



3.) I always say this, slightly embarrassingly, but FIFA 09, where Liverpool were one of the best teams in the game and I dominated with them... As I became more interested in football I started watching more and more. What followed with when Rafa and a lot of talent left etc. And the clusterfuck of a couple of years that followed, were not the easiest to take as a new fan. But thankfully we finally look to be back on the rise... Also I found out that my mother and Uncle both used to be Kopites back in the day, and they used to live on the Wirral, so tenuous family links as well...

4.) Favourite player... Torres... yeah... 


5.) I'm a diehard rugby player when I'm not watching the football. It's odd, my knowledge of Rugby is much worse than that of my footy, (only watch international rugby). But yeah, play for my Uni and my local town side =]!


6.) Carragher or Dalglish would be great down the pub, I think if you put a few pints in either they'd get a ""laddish"", which would be brilliant! And the old stories would flow out and you know you'd go for a drunken kick about in a carpark at 3am.  


7.) Andy Carroll, Newcastle lad that likes the booze? He'll have been in a few scraps in his time! (Also dat reach.) 


8.) This year, it seems so wide open, a lot of me senses that this could be our year to Sneak back into the top 4, Arsenal looking weak (although they always find a way, and Spurs are ""there"" waiting to pounce.) I think it's a two horse race between Chelsea and City (almost guarantee a Chelsea title actually...) But how Moyes may fair at Utd is an X factor that in my gut thinks ""is going to not do well"". And the fact that towards the end of the season, we're going to be fresher with no european football. I think on paper we're 5th / 6th, in my heart, we're champions &lt;3

Really? The main line of fusion research is ITER and possibly Wendelstein 7-x now that the modern heating methods mean the plasma current is obsolete and so the increased stability of the stellarator might be beneficial.

AFAIK neither of these have significant private investment. Even the much lauded inertial confinement methods used by NIF etc. aren't privately funded but in my opinion they are more about nuclear weapons research (since the Test Ban Treaty) than fusion power.

There are some private companies but they are extremely small and pursuing quite offbeat methods for fusion and most of them are probably cranks or scam artists. Either way they have orders of magnitude less funding than ITER etc. and are far less likely to achieve any success.

Because a fan knows tradititions, songs, chants from older generations doesn't make that fan entitled to better fandom than newer fans. If one is able to go to all the matches, then good on them. But going to matches doesn't make you a better fan in my opinion. Geographical limitations make it impossible for global fans to see a game let alone every match. 

I don't mean to offend, but there is a chauvanistic attitude in this community of the right way to be a fan. Football is a global game, and the EPL is viewed by millions in probably every continent. Why be so strict and stringent on how to be accepted by Chelsea fans?  Supporting Chelsea shouldn't be so exclusive that we don't welcome all fans whether new or old.  

I tend to take the view not taken by the hive mind. Apologies to the subreddiit community, but I refuse to accept that there is right way to show my love and support of Chelsea. While I do care of the history and the traditions of the club, I don't believe that knowledge should be criteria of being a ""true fan"".  For me, supporting and loving the club, the badge itself, and all the players and staff is enough to qualify myself as a fan.  If you disagree, then to each our own.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"Okay, this is just a ballpark ... and based on UK, as that's where I hail from. Not all figures are 100% solid, but I did my best.

1964 average salary (per year) was 1,163 GBP ... it increased along a pretty linear trend to a 1980 average salary (per year) of 4,815 GBP. Then is saw a much steeper trend, but essentially still linear to a 2009 average salary (per year) of 37,580 GBP.

That's a 45 year period, so someone starting work at age 20 in 1964, and retiring at 65 in 2009 would be paying approximately 10% of those salaries into the National Insurance system. Now this system pays for our Health Service and Pensions, but for sake of argument let's assume ALL 10% is used for Pensions.

At 5% compound interest, calculated yearly, you end up with a ""fund"" of 155,229 GBP. Now as their salary JUST before retiring was 37,580 GBP, then that fund is good for 4 YEARS to maintain the same level of income.

At 10% compound interest, calculated yearly, you end up with a ""fund"" of 432,561 GBP, which is good for 11 YEARS.

So what happens after 4 years, or 11 years ? Who pays for the pensions then ??? The working taxpayer, that's who. In UK, average life expectancy is 80 years. So every single pensioner in the country will be draining between 4 and 11 years of pension money directly from the working taxpayers who are paying in NOW. What happens when they retire, when 1/4th of all THEIR contributions were used to fund the previous generation ? 

Now please, if you can point me at ANY investment that guarantees 10% (after tax) with ZERO-risk, consistently year-on-year for almost 50 years, please tell me where it is, and I'll sink my entire life savings into it tomorrow. It's a demonstrable fact that somewhere between 4 years and 11 years after retirement, EVERYTHING you paid into the system has been used up. 

Furthermore, as it's well recognized that the disparity between inflation and wages is getting worse as time goes on, your money is worth progressively less and less.

It's got fuck all to do with left or right wing ideologies. It's a simple fact that the paying-in period / amount and the ""taking-out"" period are no longer balanced, and there IS a shortfall, whether you want to admit it or not.

In UK, 23% of ALL public spending is on benefits, and 47% of that goes on pensions, with unemployment, housing, childcare, disability and all the other myriad benefits accounting for the remaining 53%.

I wouldn't mind, but the original pensions act of 1908 had a qualifying age limit of 70, and WAS originally means tested, so only those who really NEEDED it qualified. In the last 100 years, we've lowered and lowered and lowered the retirement age, we've allowed anyone to claim it whether they works 45 years or just 1 day, whether they have 0 savings, or 10 million savings ... and it's all tumbling down around our heads, because it is simply not sustainable.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"There is no future devastation.  We can build quite adequate containment, the amount of waste is diminishing all the time, the reprocessing of fuel is improving.  It's a bonanza of surplus energy, or could be.

The really annoying fact is that for all green activists want us to be cycling everywhere on wicker bikes and washing our linens in the river with a rock - they're actually harming the planet.  The real changes will come about from technologies like 'air capture', synthetic fuels that only require air and electricity, biomass2 fuels that don't require arable land.   These are the things that will make a real difference - but they currently require lots of electricity - and cutting down generation or making its supply more temperamental makes it more expensive. You could take every car off the road, produce the greenest trains, and ration evening electricity and it still wouldn't have a fraction of the effect that cheap, plentiful electricity creating second gen biofuels and synthesised air fuel for ships and planes would have.  Hell, if electricity were cheaper there'd be a lot more interest in electric cars.

What's not going to make a positive difference is when people suggest we should hogtie the economy in the short to long term, cut back on nuclear, effectively slowing down development and research because it's more important that some people feel like they're doing something than actually doing something that works.

The idea that nuclear fuel waste is a ten thousand year problem, or whatever it is, makes me chuckle too.  If we aren't able to shuttle into the orbit with regular ease and minimal effort in a 100 years then we are doing something wrong.  This 10 000 year problem will be a highschool project by the next century, with kids pressing the button that sends an entire decade's nuclear waste on a trajectory for the sun.  

It's with a sad irony that the Green movement has actually become the greatest hindrance to looking after the environment for future generations.  They even have a problem with gas turbines, for Pete's sake.   The idea that we can all stop commuting to work, or close industries down when the wind doesn't blow, or just use significantly less - and that it will happen and people will put up with it - just goes to show how detached they've become.

This is a problem with the system rather than something we want to preserve. For the most part governments should be thinking about how to properly use their executive powers. Not how they can abuse the legislative rail road. A focus on less legislation and more on good government would result. It would increase the power of the commons relative to government and that is a good thing.

My understanding is that a coaxial connection can grant up to a 100 megabyte per second throughput, which would allow you to achieve that sought after gigabit connection.

 A wider proliferation of the device makes it no more likely to be used. Lets say we have a group of 10 officers who over the course of a month require the use of TASER 10 times. If one officer is trained to use that TASER then that single officer will have to use TASER 10 times on the other hand if all 10 are trained and equipped with it then each may only use it once. Of course that is somewhat false because it assumes that each one would attend one incident where TASER would be used, in reality of course one officer may attend no such incidents and another three but by the time you scale it up to 100,000 then the distribution should become a lot more even. 

CS/PAVA spray and TASER are considered to roughly the same on the ACPO use of force continuum. So would be used as readily as one another. The interesting thing is that, over the years, what forces have noticed is that officers actually don't use CS in situations where they could more than justify having done so. Every officer is equipped with CS.

CBs: Right now Agger &amp; Toure. We were so much better at the back when Carra came back into the side and granted Toure is no Carra, his experience can't be undervalued.

LB: Enrique. I think he will return to his form at the beginning of last season. 

CMs: Lucas and Stevie. They will be the heart beat of the midfield this season.

CAM: This is the tough one, with all the rumors, and not wanting to push Coutinho out of position, Suarez needs to be behind the striker.

LW: I haven't seen enough of the new boys to stick them in the lineup so Downing as of now, but that could easily change. 

RW: Coutinho. I hate him not being in the middle, but we've seems he can do wonders all over the pitch. 

ST: Sturridge, obviously.

But the bottom line is the UK will want Faslane, in order to

* Maintain its nuclear arsenal
* Rapidly deny Russian access to the Atlantic via the GIUK gap

Both of those interests are also EU and US interests. The only people that have an interest in removing the UK from Faslane are the Scots themselves.

Honestly, you look around the world and you see the degree to which the British public has its opportunities for change laid out on a plate, we simply do not take any action to force those changes through. 

I've been looking at this cycling campaign recently, it is a historic complaint that cycling is neglected in Britain, we're at a time when we have two consecutive pro-cycling mayors of the capital city, we have a pro-cycling Prime Minister and a pro-cycling Transport Minister, we have a major broadsheet newspaper putting its weight behind the campaign. A whole swathe of people in positions of power are begging to have the ammunition to force these policies through their parties and through government. The reaction from the public is limp.

We had a referendum for electoral reform, which was manifestly a good idea, and people complained that it cost an amount of money which sounded big (but actually wasn't) and were persuaded away with [the most embarrassing populist arguments](http://www.markething.cz/wp-content/uploads/NO-to-AV-Baby-image.jpg), the people who complained that it wasn't enough joined forces with the people who complained it was too much, a significant proportion of the public voted against it because they disliked one politician, and the whole thing flopped.

Parties have launched political funding talks, and how often do you hear about it in the press? How often do you hear about it on this subreddit? Even if it was a public relations stunt by the parties, we could put such pressure on that they were forced to make changes. If any changes go through, it will be solely because the politicians who happen to find themselves in power are by some freak occurrence selfless and decent, because we create a situation where they damage their prospects by taking action.

We live in an age where for the first time in history we have these astonishing online tools for campaigning and organizing, and they are not made use of. People are too incapable or uninterested to look carefully enough at politics to identify even the most obvious underlying problems, and too apathetic to take the really very basic action necessary to create constant pressure which over time will force through changes to solve those problems. And so the political system flails around, and will continue to do so until the British public get a grip.

Can do no such thing. The law leaves no room for the Government to make decisions about hypothetical extraditions.

They issued a what? What kind of warrant are we talking about here? There is no arrest warrant, that much I know.

&gt;and lets be honest It's not beyond the realms of possibility that the US constructed these allegations against him as Sweden has a history of extraditions of prisoners to the US.

Can you give examples? You do know that the Egyptians (literally the only case anyone ever mentions) were deported, not extradited, and that they were deported to Egypt, not the US.

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"""The problem with Tasers is that they are inherently open to abuse, as they are easy to carry and easy to use and can inflict severe pain at the push of a button, without leaving substantial marks."" 

&gt; That's wrong right off of the bat. Firstly TASER has something called AFID. Basically it shoots out small strips of paper like confetti which has the cartridge number written on it. An officer will have that cartridge logged to them when they take it out on that shift so there is no question about who used the TASER. The device itself has an on board computer which can tell how long the TASER was on for, at what time, how many times it was discharged, whether or not a cartridge was attached etc. This information has to be reviewed by a supervisor and as per any use of of force the officer must right notes about it. 

""Police officers also used Tasers on schoolchildren, pregnant women and even an elderly person with dementia.""

Again this is somewhat of a fallacy. What do I do, as a grown man (and a bit of a lump at that) about a child is wielding a knife? I could try kicking them but that's very likely to do them a lot more harm than a TASER would, Equally some 14 or 15 year olds can be quite large and nearly as difficult to fight with as a grown man. Equally a pregnant woman, was she showing, would the officer who did that have known at the time? What were the alternative options, spray maybe, unless its windy, or in an enclosed space when it may be less than a good idea. Equally those who suffer dementia can be violent and they can be surprisingly strong. I've been chased round a house by a family member with dementia who did not recognise me and they were weilding a knife at the time. I can see how a TASER might be a good option even there. 

A lot of this appears to be from the US so its worth noting that the procedures are very different and that the threats they face are different to here in the UK so the TASER may be used more readily. Also now there is a lot more real world data we have a much better understanding of it and its affects. As it says at the bottom of the article in 50 of the 334 cases in the US has a coroner decided that TASER contributed to that person's death. So there is hardly an epidemic problem here I would have said. What they don't appear to know or mention is how many times the device has been used so its hard to see, relatively how safe it is based on that alone.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Thanks for doing this, I can see you put in some effort, so I want to applaud that first of all.  I'll have to read it properly and cogitate on it a bit before I can give it the treatment it deserves, but I do have a couple of initial observations.

Firstly, you have completely ignored employers' contributions (@12.8% of salary), which effectively more than double what would be contained in any employed individuals' fund.  You might argue that that is not money ""I paid in"", I'd argue that it's effectively part of my salary.

Secondly, you've totally ignored all of the deaths in service, deaths prior to retirement and other non-claimers for one reason or another.  Now these will attract some payments some of the time, but it is unlikely that the amounts paid out will always or even commonly be in the same ballpark as to a""full"" retiree.  Although we're considering how much a person pays in and whether that fully covers their retirement, this is a social fund which people pay into and draw out of in a social manner.  Each person pays in knowing that there is a fair chance they will never live to receive the ""payout"". So you need to multiply the cost of a full pension by the probability that any individual will live to see it to know how big the fund needs to be.  Put this another way, for everybody who needs more than the 11 years you quote, how many will need less, and how many will need none?

Thirdly, you only talk about interest on investment once the pension is paid out - in other words you're thinking in terms of buying annuities or investing the lump sum for income during retirement.  I was thinking more about how much interest could be accrued during the working life of the person paying in to the scheme.  Governments lend at interest all the time, and their risk horizons are very long, their funds are very large and their ability to chase bad debtors include armies, navies and air-forces...so over all, risks tend to be low and returns reasonably good.",0,1373551016,null,0,false,0,cb0f55j,t3_1hxyyo,t1_cb0f55j,t1_cb0e033,null,1430506295,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't know about England but I doubt it's any different from Wales and Scotland. If referring to the UK, please, dear gods, do not refer to it as ""England"".

Furthermore, why would they share the same phone codes? 911 isn't a thing here, 999 is, or (less commonly) 112.

My negative attitude simply stems from my fundamental confusion - why would things be the same?

&gt; slang vernacular traveled across the pond because of pop culture/media.

Some does but something that technical and specific? Not a chance. I can think of about three instances in pop culture where it comes up, maybe five at a stretch. That may sound like an odd thing to say but I have a bizarrely encyclopaedic, somewhat Abed-like, way of storing data on this stuff. We all have our useless talents, you know?

I would know what it meant but in the context of football it confuses me because it looks so much like a formation (i.e. 4-4-2). I'd have to think about it and even when I understood it'd feel condescending and lazy. Just because we share a similar language doesn't make our culture the same, something the US has earned quite the bad rep for in recent years.

The UK were far better at empire building. Our arrogant colonialism was at least charming in a despicable sort of way! \*chuckles\*

I know that it's somewhat old hat to dig at the US and its foreign policy but it really has coloured its interactions with the rest of the world.

3.Dad was all about rugby so my initiation to football was through Internationals and through friends, my best friends family were massive man u fans and took me to a few of their games one of which was Liverpool in 88, there the seed was sown but it took a while for the tree to grow. Once I moved out of home in 1999 I started to follow football off my own back, I didn't really have a team I just wanted to watch football but I always had a massive soft spot for Liverpool, it helped that I visited the city regulary and loved it but it was mainly how I felt watching them play. Anyway I remember feeling like I should have one team rather than just be a football fan so thought about it and me...  
Should I pick a local team, i suppose so but which one. Should I go with the top team at the moment, my best mate supports them but yet I can't stand them. Should I go with my favourite kit, fuck off mate. Ok who am i and what do I love, unwavering loyalty, creativity, excitement, tenacity, willingness to battle to the death, humour. Shit. Liverpool. I am actually a Liverpool fan. That was it decided, well mostly it was cemented on that night of 2005. I remember watching the game 1.2.3 down. But still believing, still there with faith and when Gerrard came back out in the second I was watching him and just knew, it was just me and him in that room at times, Stevie I can see it in your eyes, you have this Stevie, come on son show the world what we are about. I was certain we were going to do it, I was certain we were we, I wasn't I anymore. I was Liverpool and I understood our song in my heart truly for the first time.

We can argue about the value of hindsight, but it as not like the world was unaware of the potential of machine guns when the Great War broke out.  We'd seen their impact during the American Civil War, albeit strongly limited by problems and limitations, and we knew how far the technology had advanced.  By 1914, it was clear the machine gun was going to be an issue.  Yes the generals had a sharp learning curve, the problem was they seemed to forget the lessons from one battle to the next for months if not years, and they learnt them in infantrymen's blood again and again until almost the end of the war when they finally sorted out the creeping barrage and so on.

Take another example; the tragically incompetent and heartless failure to recognise shell-shock for what it was despite all the burgeoning evidence (one could argue because they were rarely on the front lines themselves, but shacked up in very nicely appointed ""control centres"" at the rear where they were safely away from the horrors or even the understanding of the front line).  All the people who had to die, ignominiously shot as cowards...  Related to this point, is the tendency of the front-line soldiers to make unofficial truces with the enemy, you don't shoot us and we won't shoot you, and the parallel tendency of the distanced generals to order barrages - it's been alleged, sometimes of their own lines - in order to stir up the fighting again.",0,1373553048,null,0,false,0,cb0ftj5,t3_1i2lnh,t1_cb0ftj5,t1_cb0ctpc,null,1430505976,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

what do these 3 things have in common? They are one person, doing something to another person.

Drugs are one person doing something to himself, there is no victim, nobody gets hurt who cant be put to blame. if you hurt yourself with drugs, its nobody's fault but your own. But with your 3 examples, that involves another person, so your examples are actually really quite poor, and you show no ability to mentally process things.

through our talk,s you have shown no real intellectual ability at all, and you have literally no argument apart from ""because they are illegal"". Do you think for yourself at all? do you have the ability to look at the bigger picture? You cannot even answer the most basic of question, which leads me to believe you are a product of the oppression era, it's not your fault your like this, it's not your fault you are so small minded you cant think for yourself, and you have to have other people tell you what to think, because it's all you've known and it's all you will ever know unfortunately.

Take 5 to 6- he went from a very gentle personality who sacrificed himself to save another to a highly arrogant and paranoid personality whose first action was to attempt to strangle his companion (and yes, I recognize that 6 regretted his initial actions; but, his personality remained VERY arrogant all throughout his run, which was different from 5).

true,[deleted],null,null,"These are just pure, personal speculations but these are the reasons that I would suggest why:

1) Settings outside of the major metropolitan areas are environments that do not easily lend themselves to interesting story lines or dramas. The high density of populations, organizations and communities in urban centres allow for more suspension of disbelief in the variety of relationships and events that a person can get involved in. A working-class character study set in Weston-super-Mare would paint a harrowing portrait of a young, alienated working-class man struggling with the choice of whether he should throw his empty McDonald's bag out the driver or passenger side window, while enjoying a fat smoke with his homies in the Homebase car park on a Friday night.

2) Major urban centres usually have more pro-active and well-funded local arts / film councils or organizations that have experience with media companies looking to film in their area. They probably far more effectively facilitate the bureaucratic side of getting film production off the ground for this reason. Members of these organizations may also have pre-existing connections in the industry that draw companies to those areas. These areas also usually have better facilities for accommodating the production, such as hotels, props departments, public spaces, locations lists and be less of an attention draw to the locals. These areas also probably provide more financial incentives / cost saving measures to production teams, whereas local councils can't afford to do so.

3) ""What is drama but life with the dull bits cut out?"". Similar to the first point, life in smaller places is often considerably duller and doesn't provide fertile ground for storytelling. Urban centres also generally force more relationships and emotional reactions on the people who live there, meaning stories set in those environments provide an emotional palette that is potentially more relatable to more people.

4) Perhaps similar reasons to why the U.S. produces so many films that represent Black / African-American communities through gang and 'hood culture - a cultural and industry bias that is entrenched in stereotypes but that is 'gritty', 'exciting', 'exotic' and sells well to less discerning audiences. These urban locations are also far more easily marketable to foreign audiences, as major urban centres are possibly more recognizable than Yeovil or Taunton might be.

The store was busy one afternoon after I finished work - with a lot of people waiting for the self-service check-outs but nobody using the cashiers. Nobody seemed interested in going forward to the cashier and I was third in line in the queue so I went to the cashier queue entrance..

..only to be told that I would have to go to the back of the line (feels like being in school again..) - I asked the girl explaining this *why* as I was using the queue entrance. She told me it wasn't an entrance. I reached to my left and rotated the small sign saying ""queue entrance"" so that both she and I could read it: ""Yes it is, look"" - I said. 

She continued to argue (with a lot of sighing and drama) that the sign (and I) were wrong and I had to rejoin at the back of the long line.

I did so - by the time I got back to the checkouts the sign had been removed. I asked for the girls name and forwarded the whole event on to Tesco's customer support - no idea if anything came of it - but happily I don't live near that store any more. Not exactly something I needed at the end of a long business day! 

I sympathise that it's hard to remain upbeat and helpful in a superstore like that - but I've worked in customer service as well and as much as it can suck, that's the job. ",0,1373554475,null,0,false,0,cb0gcnq,t3_1i2vmp,t1_cb0gcnq,t1_cb0g6bj,null,1430505725,40,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,40

true,BenlovesBud,eng-hampshire,bristol,"So you resort to stereotyping now, do you? I am not addicted to any drug besides tobacco. 

Let me tell you a few things because you know absolutely fuck all about the drug trade. The majority of synthetic drugs i.e MDMA, methedone, ecstasy are made in first world countries, because they require lab conditions, they also require a chemist, who knows what the fuck they are doing. You dont get that in 3rd world countries. Just about the only drugs made there are heroin and cocaine, and guess what, i dont use either of those.

&gt;the people in 3rd world countries who are abused at your expensive are all of your victims.

This is an interesting statement, and you obviously cannot think for yourself, so i'll do all the thinking and hard work for you, okay?
Lets turn it into a question, how can we stop the ""3rd world country abuse?"".

Well, surely the best way is to remove the incentive for them to do this, correct? Well how can we do that?

How about, lets mass produce the drugs cheaply in a country that has strict working conditions, where everything that goes in is regulated, and the people working are in suitable conditions, they get a minimum wage at least, and they pay income tax to help grow the struggling economy, does that seem like a good idea? Well i hear you thinking, ""how can we do that?""

Here is an idea,LETS DO IT IN ENGLAND!. Everyone who works in this country has to get paid at least minimum wage, thats the law. Working conditions have to up to a certain standard because people will check on them. There will be no lack of workers because there are millions of people now who are unemployed, shall we give them a job? Now it's produced in England, we know what has gone into the drugs because it is all regulated, so they are safe = no more deaths from unregulated substances. We can tax the sale of them! bringing even more mkoney into our economy, which we desperately need.

And now you say ""no, lets keep the drugs illegal, keeping the people who are in terrible conditions in those conditions, lets give all the money to organised crime, which has a negative effect on our country, and lets put everyone who does something completely natural in a cage, and the tax payer can pay to keep them there"".

It says that because she is a woman she is stupid.

It is the connotation of this phrase and its context that makes the remark sexist. A good example of this kind of thing is that calling someone a Scot isn't racist, calling someone a Paki is. Again, it's about how that particular insult is used in society.

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"So ill add something to the Debate:

Those who only started following Chelsea have not been through the pain of following Chelsea FC through the properly dark days when we couldn't get a result for love nor money, as in dads years. You may say that some years have been bad, but comparatively to the past, not in the slightest. 

I am lucky as I started properly supporting in 1996-7 and we were doing ok-Ish then and pick up a couple if trophies. 

80% of this subreddit are American and a large proportion of those hadn't supported Chelsea until they won the premier league. It happens when a sport is picking up in a country and you're looking for teams to choose. The most successful is the norm to follow, hell if my dad wasn't a Chelsea fan, I probably would have not been. 

Look at India, Liverpool, arsenal and man united are the big clubs over there, they were the successful teams when football fully came to that country. It's not your fault it's the norm. 

And now I say this. Football is tribal, traditions, cultures etc are part of being a fan, if you don't conform to those, what you say normally has little credence to us and conflict arises, it's a sad fact but its true.  

If you worked in a company that went from shit to great, you don't give shot to people who have been working 10+ years more than you unless you are in a better position in the organisation (sadly you're not because you can't go to games, a true tangible way of showing loyalty and dedication, not a football shirt) because they are more senior, have seen more stuff and have a longer track record and more than likely have more experience and ways of getting about and know more people who have also been there. What he says pretty much goes. 

So why is it not the same here? it's posturing based on insecurity. People on this subreddit are so eager to coin phrases and names, and tell people how they should act to try and appear that they are better fans than the rest.  

We get annoyed because we have our set of ways based around the club, where it can be seen as a physical, tangible part of our culture. It rubs us the wrong way cause when we are brought up to think a different way. 

However don't fault us. You guys are just as fucking bad. We mention Jose not mou and a whole issue arises. You tell us how we should be acting so don't have to get shit from people and your friends on reddit and in your life.

true,reddittrees2,null,null,"Oh dear, that's so hard, there are so so many. Lets just go through them season by season shall we? First up S01E02 ""The end of the world"". Eccleston gives a speech in that episode about humanity and what if humanity really makes it and survives for 4 billion years. That was also Rose's first trip with him and it was pretty cool to watch the sun go red giant and destroy earth, even if life on the planet would be gone long before that. 

Next up: S02E08 ""The Impossible Planet"" and S02E09 ""The Satan Pit"" and I like those two because of all the questions it raises, and all the questions it doesn't answer. I love the open endedness of it, and how even the doctor doesn't even really want to know what was really down there. 

Now for: S03E15. I know it's a Christmas special and not technically part of the season, but I really love that episode. The relationship that develops between the Doctor and Astrid, and (god I'm gonna butcher this) banacathalata being the best character ever. ""Banacathalata CYBORG!!"" If I have to pick a regular season episode it's ""Gridlock"", first the idea of selling moods is really interesting, second the whole neverending highway of doom. Also seeing how New (new new new new_) New York has changed since his last visit. 

Season 4 is really really hard, there are so many good episodes. The Waters of Mars is probably my favorite. It shows a side of the Doctor we don't often get to see: power tripping. Saving people who shouldn't be saved, and then that ending...so sad. The Silence in The Library set of episodes was really great too, probably one of the creepiest episodes I've seen. It's also where the River storyline starts (ends?, time-wimey) which I think is pretty neat. There's also Midnight which was the creepiest fucking thing ever. For once, the Doctor wasn't all powerful, he was just as powerless as everyone else in that episode. 

Season 5, another hard one. The Beast Below is really great, love the entire idea behind the episode, it's also Amy's first trip anywhere with the Doctor. Also Vincent and The Doctor. That episode gets to me every time, when they go through all that in the end, they bring Vincent forward in time to see all his work and it brings him to tears, then they come back and Amy thinks there will be a bunch of new paintings but there's only one. Sunflowers. 

Six? The Girl Who Waited. No question about it. I know there's other great ones there, but that episode. Right in the feels every single time. Just the whole thing was sad, and Rory's devotion to both Amys was really touching. The ending where she tells Rory not to let her in and that she's giving other Amy the days with Rory. Then she turns around and tells the computer ""Show me earth. Did I ever tell you about this boy I met there? We pretended to be in a band."" That line strikes a sort of special chord with me...I had a girl, we pretended to be in a band, it was sort of our thing, and we both waited on the order of 8 years to come out to each other about our feelings. So yeah, that right there, might be my favorite all time. 

Seven would probably have to be Rings of Akhaten. The speech the doctor gives to the planet is amazing. The girl singing that song with that amazing voice. Also, when Clara gives up the leaf and the speech she gives, about it containing all the things that could have been but never were, all the days that were never lived, all the possibilities. 

Hope that wasn't too long for you folks. It's really hard for me to pick out just one favorite all time episode, but if I had to it would either be The Girl Who Waited or Voyage Of The Damned. 

EDIT: even though this is off the FP and will probably be seen by like 4 people: I forgot to include the episode ""43"". Probably my second favorite one ever. Burn with me.

true,badcall,num3,,"You know, I'm not surprised, but... I don't think this will happen. It's not related to the sport side of things at all.

Here's why.

American footy fans especially should know that NBC will be broadcasting all 380 Premier League matches next season. There are a lot of commercials advertising this, most notably one that shows a bunch of fans reacting to things happening that we can't see while wearing their team's colors; eventually the words, ""Forget Downton Abbey. The real English drama starts August 17th."" And there's another one with fans chanting about it and of course they all support different teams from United to Stoke and City to Villa. What's interesting about these commercials is the high concentration of Spurs supporters. If you were to run some numbers, I'd wager that at least 30% of the fans highlighted in these commercials are wearing lilywhite.

Furthermore, last season (in America again), when Premier League happened, you turned to Fox Soccer. There were usually at least two games every Saturday, one around 8:00 AM EST (1:00 PM GMT) and another following two hours later (or three, depending on the importance of a match starting at 11:00 EST). If you were to look at the broadcast schedule in the second half of the season (when Spurs shit the bed or better), even factoring out rescheduled games that were designed to specifically attract national attention in multiple countries, you'd see that Spurs were on TV more than most other teams. Spurs were also chosen often on Thursdays during Europa League matches. Nevermind Chelsea, a team that's extremely easy to market in the US, Fox Soccer wanted Tottenham on the tube at all times.

You probably know where this is going.

*Furthermore still,* every time that Spurs played, the commentators and studio pundits would talk about Dempsey. ESPECIALLY if he scored. The focus, over time, became more disgusting than *NFL pundits and how they focus so effervescently on quarterbacks* (writing this is a life-long NFL fan). 

Yeah, we have Bred Friedel, too, and there was a little favoritism when Spurs started the season, what with Brad's record to be upheld against the French National #1 who automatically fits better in the system than he, but there was a much more concentrated effort to get Spurs on TV for Clint Dempsey (granted, it's hard to complain, I like my big TV much better than streaming the game).

So what's my point? I don't know if this is Levy's doing, but NBC is marketing the Premier League with a Tottenham focus (read: Tottenham is more important than the likes of United, Chelsea, the arse, Liverpool) in order to grab American interest in world football. What better way to do it than with arguably the best player on the American national side, *not to mention* someone who's from Texas (and a small, blue-collar town at that), *not to mention* someone who would score a goal before putting forth an effort to win the ball only noticeable to the diehard fans who make up such a small portion of a network's revenues, which is something that statistically consistently sells well in the States - 2 mistakes and 1 big play is valued over no mistakes and consistent mediocrity or better. We Americans tend to value short-term satisfaction over long-term benefit - just look at the two football sports: one features two 45-minute plays and the other a collection of hundreds of short ones [(johncleese.ogg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sD_8prYOxo), and granted it's satire so not meant to be taken 100% seriously, but whatever).

So yeah, my point is what will NBC do when the star of their own little league is shopped to Sunderland or elsewhere? Tottenham were the perfect candidates to market heavily to an American audience. Sure, Dempsey is nice, but did you see Fulham getting constant coverage while he played there? We are a Top 4 club on essentially equal footing with the most famous clubs in England, though we haven't been there for long. Not only that, but United and Chelsea already have massive profiles in America for being who they are and for having been extremely successful in the last 20 years or so, plus Arsenal is Arsenal and they'll always get a lot of fans, plus City winning the Title last year (especially the way they did it beating United 1-0 on national TV and the 3-2 QPR nut-buster) secured them a bunch of bandwagoners or better. We have an excellent chance of reaching CL next year, we have some high-profile national players in Vert, Lloris, JD, Walker, and now Paulinho (who's BRAZILIAN), a bright future, a young attractive coach, and someone whom I haven't mentioned the entire team who makes marketing Tottenham easier than anyone could imagine, GARETH FUCKING BALE. We're basically next in line.

(Maybe Bale can market the team on his own, but I really think that Dempsey will stay because ""he still has a role to play at the club."")

And on a ""football note,"" I'd like to keep him. AVB and the squad are serious about winning EL, plus I think we'll do a little better in the FA Cup than we did last year, so if you want to be one of the best clubs in England, you've gotta have insane depth. Or, you know, bomb out of all competitions by January and play nothing but BPL matches and barely squeak into the CL *qualifying round* (qualifying round) and call it a massive victory. Otherwise, if we don't need him for depth, sell him.

There are quite a few British directors out there producing films that generally avoid the tropes you mention, such as [Danny Boyle](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000965/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), [Mike Leigh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005139/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), [Edgar Wright in conjunction with Simon Pegg &amp; Nick Frost](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942367/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), [Tom Hooper](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393799/) and even [Shane Meadow's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276349/) work - while some are violent and crime-centric - are not necessarily set in the conventional urban centres that you mention in your post. These are just some famous names / films that I can think of off the top of my head.

I'd be interested to hear what examples you have from which you get this feeling. I honestly don't mean this in a critical way, just that I'm struggling to think of much beyond the rubbish Guy Ritchie puts out (that doesn't really sell well in the UK anyway, more to unwitting foreigners) or [flops like The Sweeney.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857190/?ref_=sr_1) I may be completely oblivious to it, I'd like to know if I am.

There also is the fact that exposure to more imaginative / alternative film is pretty one way (using American cinema as an example) due to the disproportionate level of exposure we get to American culture. I can watch a film like Fargo or Reservoir Dogs (am I showing my age?!) and have a reasonable grasp on the culture or tropes they are playing off of due to the vast amount of American media I consume. American media is aggressively marketed to us and has a deep reservoir of prior familiarity for new stuff to appeal to. Americans on the other hand are far less exposed to 'normal' British culture and much more disinterested about seeing media set in that context. So alternative film that leverages British culture just doesn't appeal and isn't seen over there.",0,1373555808,null,0,1373559352,0,cb0gv3k,t3_1i2wxc,t1_cb0gv3k,t1_cb0gg9f,null,1430505484,14,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,14

http://www.swedenversusassange.com/Investigation.html#ITPA

&gt; The questioning of complainant SW was amended and created as a new file in the computerised system (DurTvÃ¥) on 26 August. The new memorandum was signed by Krans, under the instructions of Mats Gehlin after an email exchange between them (see the leaked email exchange). Krans had been denied access to her own file in the system (DurTvÃ¥) and was taken off the case (see p. 12 of the leaked memorandum in Swedish, or the comment on 1 September by Irmeli Krans in the English translation).

&gt; Complainant SWâs interview had not been read nor approved by her, which is clear from the record. The interview was interrupted by Krans when it became clear that complainant SW could not continue because she was upset after being informed that an order for the arrest of Julian Assange had been issued for her complaint. Subsequently it has emerged that the original statement, and the one that has been released to the press differ significantly. Certain passages of the narrative account of SWâs testimony have been added. The two versions of SWâs testimony were discovered when a Swedish blogger published the original, redacted version that had been released to the press on 25 August 2011 (after the ârapeâ investigation was first terminated). It was then contrasted with the later version that has been widely published online.

So the first investigation was shut down, Krans the initial interrogate an acquaintance of AA, screamed ""SKAAAAAAANDAL"" then set about getting BorgstrÃ¶m in on the case to right this apparent wrong. An edited witness statement (unsigned by the witness) to sex-up the amount of violence involved was used to further the case a second time.

What Edinburgh needs is a decent fibre optic broadband provider that doesn't slow down your speeds during certain times of day/while doing certain activities (iplayer, Torrents, etc).

In summary: 
Speed is nothing, quality is everything. I'd love a 5MB connection which is ALWAYS 5MB with no time or download restrictions and a 2.5MB upload speed. I don't understand why a consumer would need more (unless you have 5 children all trying to watch HD in separate rooms simultaneously).

3) A lot of little reasons, but I knew (and liked) Gerrard from watching international games, so it seemed natural. 

4) Gerrard, but Coutinho is already carving out a spot in my heart as well. And this might sound weird, but I really like Borini. The look on his face when he scored that goal this year...amazing.

5) Ice hockey...lacrosse, I guess. Used to care about American football, but I'ma longtime Bills fan, so...yeah.

6) Sturridge, that'd be a fun night. Or Xabi, just to see the pure handsomeness up close (imagine all the ladies he'd attract; they can't all go home with him, right?....*right?*)

7) Right now, Skrtel. Always looks angry and at the moment I suspect he's got a lot of frustration he'd love to vent somewhere...

Yes. The only situations where I wouldn't turn Alonso away are if Gerrard's being deployed differently this season (hugely unlikely), or if there was absolutely no other way that 80k/wk could be put to better use (and if that's the case, then that's due to poor scouting, honestly).

Also, saying ""Suarez leaving frees up 100k/wk, so we can afford Xabi's wages!"" is the same sort of wasteful thinking that was involved when people said ""Torres went for 50m, so it's OK to spend 35m on Carroll!"" Just because you've got the money, doesn't mean it couldn't be better spent elsewhere. 

I'd much rather have those wages go towards a quality CB, or towards someone for the right wing. I'd even be happier to see those wages cover the backups for both Enrique &amp; Lucas. 

All of those are bigger deficiencies in the squad than the role Xabi would play, a role where you've already got Gerrard, Henderson, and Allen.

4) Steven Gerrard and Robbie Fowler

5) Golf, tennis, American football, cricket, formula 1

6) Craig Bellamy. Since I volunteered for his foundation in Sierra Leone and he had to cancel his trip out there because the American government confiscated his passport. I shit you not. Story if interested.

7) Martin Kelly. Looks jacked now. I'd be annihilated.

8) 6th. Honestly. As much as I'd want to say higher, I just think the teams around us have/will improve too much too.

9) In 5 years, we'll have different owners with slightly more money but not Man City/Chelsea levels. We'll be in our 2nd straight year of CL football after reaching the last 16 the previous year. Rodgers will still be in charge and we'll have a core of many of the young players in our squad right now (Sterling, Suso, Kelly, Wisdom). Gerrard will be a coach for us in some capacity. As will Carra.

1) Two guys occupying me personally for twenty minutes in the restaurant asking me what comes with every single item on the menu, despite it being there *on* the menu itself. 

1b) The same guys interrupting/speaking over each other constantly while doing this asking me where ""can we find some *FEEEE*Males, mate?"" or where to go out for a good time. 

Three different tables after that complimented me on managing to hold my shit together instead of tearing off a piece.

2) Being assholes when it comes to paying their bill. They get a room allowance that is paid by their company. Instead of keeping all the details together on the same tab and paying it off, they do their best to spread it around, causing multiple tabs to be opened that need to be paid off using the same cash- Eg their allowance is Â£10 and tab A) is Â£10 and tab B) is Â£10 - but for the same guy. This means lots of paperwork, running around and getting them back down from rooms to pay the balance.

3) Is the really important one - I've never met such a bunch of sexist shitheads in my life.

a) Bent over double so their eyeline is at ass-height while perving on our female waitstaff.

b) following said waitstaff around the restaurant/making godawful comments when they bring stuff to the table.

c) asking me which of my colleagues id rather bang, in priority order.

d) ringing the front desk at midnight asking a barmaid to take some stuff to the room by herself. At best, a fucking creepy come-on, at worst a rape attempt.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Taking a monopoly and handing it to someone whose primary interest is making a profit is a recipe for disaster. How is this not obvious?
&gt; 
&gt; The train system will always be a monopoly, because passengers have no choice over which train to get on to get from point A to point B. The only way this can work if the objective of the system is to provide the service, not to make a profit.

I agree with the general point, but there's a straw man which is being argued against here. The choice isn't between a nationalized company and a freely operating private company, it's between a nationalized company and a private company operating within a very strict regulatory environment.

For instance, you often hear about how water leakage rates are terrible, and this is because private companies don't properly invest in infrastructure. But actually leakage rates have improved after privatization, because private water utilities have strict targets set by Ofwat, which they have to meet or else face fines. The reason you hear large leakage rates bandied around is because Ofwat impose variable targets around the country, strict for Southern and Central England, where there are drought problems, and lax elsewhere. Someone who wants to make a point about privatization writes an article saying 'there is a hosepipe ban (we won't mention it's just in the South), here are the leakage rates (we won't mention that's averaged over the whole country), this is because of privatization (we won't mention the rates have improved after privatization)'.

I think the real question that decides whether something should be privatized or nationalized is whether you can set performance requirements which capture the full service. For electricity, you can say 'we will regulate for this voltage range, this frequency range, this level or intermittency etc'. I'm not sure whether you can capture a train service with 'how many minutes late, how many complaints, etc'. There is no quantifiable metric which you can use to regulate in an objective way.

2. Didn't start paying attention to any team until 10 years old or so but Liverpool was always the only one... not sure how to really quantify that.  I'm 25 years old though.

3. It was my first ever kit at 4 years old, I picked it out before I liked the logo more than all the others.  Or in other words, to 4 year old me, it just felt like the right one*

4. Steven Gerrard.  He's my idol.  

5. Ice Hockey, Lacrosse, F1 (well, really any auto racing other than Nascar, that shit sucks ass and I get dizzy just watching it)

6.  Does it have to be only 1 of them?  You'd expect me to say Stevie for this one but I think I'd go with King Kenny, God, Pepe, or Enrique because they all seem pretty funny and with the latter two I could practice my Spanish. 

7. Martin Skrtel or Soto Kyrgiakos and his wonderful ponytail of doom.  Plus have you seen 300, greeks fuck shit up way too hard on the battle field, no thank you.

8. If Suarez stays and we make 2 big signings (an attacker and a CB) then we have a really good shot at 4th place, and I believe we can do it.  If he goes then we're definitely looking at 5-7 place.  I don't know why we'd go 5 years ahead when clearly next year *will be our year!*  Ok, fine, in 5 years we're able to mount a very serious challenge to the top 3 and possibly even the title, also in with a shout for the Champion's League and domestic cups (think about it, the likes of Sterling/Suso/Coutinho will be 24-25 years old at that point, Allen/Hendo/Sturridge coming into their prime years at 26-28, and we'll have had a year or two to adjust to Stevie's probable retirement and reinvent our midfield without him).  Five years is a seriously long time to develop our current project and if all goes well then the sky is the limit really.

The quote:

&gt;Dare I say itâs now or never.

Gets under my skin. Some idiot says this every window, but every window Levy shops smart and is prudent and spurs edge closer to their goals. Slowly but surely this tortoise will win the race - patience is key. 

I can promise you that the brain power at Hotspur HQ (Levy, Baldini, AVB, Sherwood etc) will know far more about targets, far more about current squad requirements and far more about finances and if they don't deem it a good idea to go and blow Â£25m-Â£30m on a striker then who are we to disagree? From memory, only three PL clubs have ever gone out and spent Â£25m+ on a striker, the billionaire playthings City and Chelsea and the far richer Man Utd (I am disregarding the Â£35m on Carroll as that was Â£15m + player deal). 

We don't know how much coin needs to go to the stadium, how much faith the youth coaches have on the likes of Shaq or Coulibaly. To say spurs need to sign a class striker or risk falling away forever is to forget how the last 5 or so years have panned out for us (yes I am mad btw).

Spurs are building towards the top by buying talented/quality youngsters (20-24) at affordable prices and moving them on for profit and/or further investment. This is a sustainable model and if you look at our starting 11 you will see that it is a method that produces class players. Our best 4 players (Bale, Vertonghen, Lloris and Sandro) almost all cost under Â£10m and flops don't sting the business. 

To think there isn't a smart striker buy out there is to be blinded by the media into believing that there are only 5 damn strikers in the world. Spurs fell short by 1 point last season and have already improved the starting 11 thrice (Sandro/Kaboul return and Paulinho - some would argue Rose too), no need to blow the budget now. Stick to the principles that work, find a young/talented striker (Ben Yedder anyone?) and throw him in the mix. That is what has worked for spurs previously and the exact same thing that landed PL clubs guys like Michu and Benteke in the first place.

Bony would have been a good shout, PAE too. Slot those guys into the squad and rotate our three strikers until they settle. That is how spurs do things and I expect that is how spurs will handle the striker situation.

Besides, the screen dump you showed me does in no way show that Krans was involved in the appeal, especially not since it was already his job.

Now I may also sound like a 'spoilt child' here but I find watching good strikers head to our rivals and other clubs thoroughly annoying. Especially the Bony and Altidore deals. Either of those could have been an exceptional strikers to rotate with who ever else we brought in. Assuming we are actually going for two strikers.

So all in all.

Personally perhaps it's just my American bias -- I'm a huge USA supporter and would love to see a yank on LFC -- I'd say he'd be worth it if the price is low enough. But I'm not sure how much Spurs want for him, and I don't think he'd be worth giving up any of our other targets for.

The newer nuclear reactor designs _are_ failsafe. Take one of the more intuitive examples: If the reactor goes to melt down it melts a plug in the bottom of the reactor and the fuel safely pours out and spreads into a containment area, spreading out so as to lose the critical mass necessary to sustain the reaction. Once this has happened the fuel cools and turns into a vaguely radioactive lump in the bottom of a massive sarcophagus of lead steel and concrete. It's physically impossible (given any conditions that may occur naturally on the surface of the earth) for the system to get into an unrecoverable state where the radioactive material escapes the containment chamber.

The Antarctic ice sheet melting would be cataclysmic for a lot of low lying areas, but it's still remarkably healthy when compared to predictions from 20-30 years ago.

But anyway, that's quite irrelevant to oil drilling in the arctic. Oil drilling in the arctic has been going on for more than half a century and hasn't caused _any_ major issues.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying environmentalism is a bad thing, I'm saying the issue they've chosen to make a point about is a non-issue. Deforestation of the rain forest is an issue. Pollution of ground water is an issue. Unchecked CO2 emissions and toxic gas emissions is an issue.

Nope, the people that mine this fuel would probably be miners or just machines. Thorium is widespread all around the world, though existing mining doesn't tend to be done by ""poverty stricken peasants"" it tends to be done by huge multi national companies, but that's not really relevant to the viability of nuclear power.

The main reason nuclear power isn't more widespread is a lack of public education about the actual state of the technology.

As I understand it, radioactive material is very hazardous to life forms. Is this not the case?

I am suspicious of nuclear power because I think that people cut corners, get lazy or greedy and we risk covering the world with highly toxic timebombs.

true,bonesingyre,null,null,"We aren't a champions league side. Plain and simple. We aren't even in Europa League. But LFC fans expect LFC to win the EPL, FA Cup, CC etc.. all next year as well as qualify for CL. This is the stigma that goes with being a great club. FSG is rebuilding the team to be a great team very soon but also for the future. I applaud their decision making and sticking with their strategy.

As a lifelong New York Yankees fan, its very similar. The Yanks are the most successful baseball club in history with 28 world series wins and countless pennant wins (division wins). Every year they are a top 5 favorite to win. They are also known as the Evil Empire, because the Owner would spend obscene sums of money to get the best players. (Basically the Chelsea of baseball). Alex Rodriguez - 252 million over 10 years is just ONE example of the type of contracts doled out. The Yankees club valuation is approximately 1.8 billion, which sits right behind Real Madrid and Barcelona.

The team always has the stigma of win the world series or go home. Since the early 1900s with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and then later with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, they have won many titles. They then went through a huge drought of titles, failing to make playoffs, and just being a piss-poor team. The team was bought by George Steinbrenner, who revamped the team and also focused on scouting and youth. Yanks ended up winning multiple titles in 1990s and 2000s.

Most people fail to realize that the core the yankees that won so many world series in the late 1990s and 2000s were 4 HOMEGROWN players, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitie, and Jorge Posada. They all played critical positions. The Yankees reign during that time was based on smart decision making and building out and training their youth. In baseball, it is very similar to football, in that there are many levels of league play where a team cand send players to gain more experience.

As much as I hate to say that LFC isn't a CL side, the same thing has happened to the Yankees. They just aren't title favorites anymore. The team has hedged their future by trading top young talent for experienced older players with obscene contracts. It paid off only once, when we won in 2009 because of a group of veterans that were brought in. Now? The team is old and decrepit, full of huge bloating contracts, (240 million in wages this year alone), and no youth to replace aging players.

LFC are recovering from these mistakes and are on the right path and the players we get are the competitive ones with a fire in their eyes, who realize they can make a name for themselves. These players will grow and in that process, LFC will win more and hopefully we'll be back in the CL and on top of the world.

Maybe FSG use the Yanks as an example since they own the Red Sox? :) 

P.S. I hated that Liverpool was owned by the same team that owns the Red Sox, as they are the direct rivals of the Yankees.

&gt;n recent years, many government departments
have come under cyber attack: often, this has involved websites being disrupted by âdenial
of serviceâ attacks,
47
and last summer over 200 email accounts across 30 government
departments were targeted in an attempt to steal confidential information. 

DDOS and brute force...not something I'd write home about

may hold government information on their own systems. We have been told that cyber
espionage â
[has] resulted in MOD data being stolen
,***.â

financial consequences for the UK

&gt;A key focus for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is to define exactly how it envisages
using cyber capabilities during future military campaigns. We have been told that the
MOD has developed a joint doctrine on cyber operations, which sets out how cyber
activities integrate into military operations and the legal framework within which they
could be used.


&gt;53. To assist with its development of cyber capabilities, we have been told that the
MOD is hoping to recruit those with specialist skills into the Reserve forces. The work
they might do would have to be different from that traditionally undertaken by Reservists,
as the Chief of Defence Intelligence explained:
Our intent is to go out to the young computer professionals and make them an offer
to do something good for their country but which will not require them necessarily
to be doing normal [Reservist] business... weâre very much focused on the fact that
these will not be people that will spend a lot of time running around ranges with
rifles. Weâre going to offer them a different proposition, as it were, if they want to be
in the Reserve cyber

Actually no he didn't. He made some good saves against QPR when our defence wasn't performing and, once again, our attacking midfield looked inherently uninspired.

With Reading there wasn't many faults with his performance either. The whole team collectively switched off at the end of the match and consequently let in 2 late goals. To blame that result on him would be extremely naive of you.

true,a_treacle_fiend,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"There are 2 or 3 reasons that I believe nuclear energy to suitably safe, so hopefully that'll address most of your concerns.

The associated hazard with the material used in nuclear plants is basically due to its half-life (the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into other materials). It's dangerous because the half-life is very long (it can be hundreds of years depending on the substance, but this does vary) and all through this time it is emitting ions (charged particles) that can, amongst other unpleasant affects, cause cancer. However, this waste is most commonly buried deep enough under ground that it has no impact upon humans or the environment until it becomes stable.

Then, there is the quantity of material used. Radium, a less efficient material than the Thorium that new plants propose the use of, is many thousands of times better at producing energy than coal. Taking conservative estimates, 1kg of can produce at least as much energy as 20 tons of coal. In addition to this being clearly superior in terms of sheer practicality, this also massively diminishes the waste. So, in relative terms, the danger of the nuclear material that we are burying is not only reduced by the fact that the radiation is absorbed, but also because there is physically far less material to cause damage.

Finally, you cited Japan, which rightly causes a great deal of concern. There are two issues with the plant at Fukushima. It was old. And it was in bloody Japan. The age is significant because standards of safety have increased since it was commissioned in the early 70s. Even so, the impact of the disaster was greatly minimised by automated safety procedures that launched the material into a pool of water below the plant that greatly reduced the energy of the material. The issue with it being built in Japan, is that, geographically, that it pretty much the last place on earth that a nuclear plant should have been built. In the UK, in particular, we just don't face the risk of natural disasters big enough to lead to such a disaster for the same reasons.

Same for illegal activity in your house, that sort of thing. There's not enough social housing to meet current demand because people either buy it or trash it or have lifelong tenancies so don't move on when they could (and maybe ought) so councils have to ensure they are focusing on only the cases with greatest need, and it's the case that fault has to be factored into that.

It almost sounds insane because who would intend to have nowhere to live? But I'm yet to hear a better term for it. Thankfully, the same people who tend to have to make these decisions will run themselves ragged trying to help anyone who has a genuine need, in my experience across a number of authorities. Unfortunately the cases where more might have been done tend to be the ones people make the most noise about. Those who get help and get sorted tend not to make a big deal about it.

true,HeartyBeast,cnty-uk,London,"Hang on a second.

A minute ago, you were saying that government hospitals would cause things akin to genocide, and now it's down to causing a bit of red tape and perhaps not being maximally efficient.

&gt; All of my arguments are logically self-consistent and valid.

Yes of course, they are. That's because you are starting with a strong consistent ideology and arguing based on that ideology, unencumbered by messy, inconsistent facts that may take the pristine shine from your ideas. So you take as axiomatic that government must be inefficient, because ... well, it must be, whereas the private sector must always tend towards maximum efficiency

At a guess, your core philosophy is roughly that any system where the majority can compel everyone in the group to contribute resources is wrong, because it oppresses the minority with force. I'm sure you'll tell me if I've got that wrong.

Your phraseology shows how pervasive this ideology is. So you use the words ""by force"" to describe taxation use to build hospitals, despite the fact that in Europe (for example) voters clearly support the taxation. And if insurance companies charge premiums for healthcare - that's not  ""by force"" because the people can always go to another insurance company. And those who are two poor to pay the premiums, well they have choices too, quite probably.  I'm sure you would argue that the red tape in the insurance industry is *necessary* red tape, honed by the market and that the top executives certainly don't ""siphon off"" money that should be spend on healthcare, rather it's money that they've earned through their hard work. Because those are the axioms that you are working to: logical and self-consistent.

And that's great. Because when someone asks  something like 'should we re-nationalising Britain's railways', you don't *have* to think about the question, or look at the situation or the evidence. Because you already *know* what you think. Your logically self-consistent ideology tells you. ""Of course that's a bad idea, because I know that anything anywhere in the world government involvement in anything over the bare minimum will lead to things such as starvation and genocide.""

Well done, good for you. You've found a way to avoid getting into any of the facts, compromises or messy complications that can make political decision making so irksome.

It's just like when the IRA were blowing up streets every few months, being their usual complete bastard selves but somehow this brought the British to the table.

Was it because they began to see their point of view? Fuck no, it's because the British government had to insure a lot of properties and property in Northern Ireland because no one would take the risk. It's because whenever a bomb went off in London or anywhere else it cost the economy at the very least millions to repair the damage, pay out insurance, pay for the investigation etc. et all.

When he arrived he got out of his car very flustered and said to his surgically enhanced girlfriend ""Just chat outside whilst I put things straight inside for a minute.""

He was back out almost immediately apologising for being late and making us wait and let us inside.

It was a typical batchelor pad with dodgy wallpaper but a great TV and music system. However on the walls were lots of photo of garden birds. He explained that he was a keen photographer and spent a lot of time in the garden taking photos of our feathered friends.

He then took us into the garden and was mid way through some spiel when he suddenly said to his girlfiend,

""OH !!! Can you go upstairs and *make sure things look ok*.""

""Eh ?"" said the well endowed but dim girlfriend.

""Go upstairs and ***make sure things LOOK OK***"" he repeated looking a bit desperate.

She went inside looking very puzzled and he put on a cheery expression and talked about bloody birds again. 2 minutes later the bimbo came back outside and said that everything looked ok to her. We went inside.

We went upstairs onto the landing where there were lots of other photos of birds. These ones were wearing red stockings and high heels and nothing else however. The guy sort of ushered us past into a room he used as a darkroom by which time Mrs HPB and I were wondering where the hell we were. He showed us another couple of rooms and then said he'd show us the main bedroom.

In we went to be confronted by what must have been an A2 sized picture above the bed of him shagging his girlfriend. Full colour. Definitely not shopped. We stood open mouthed gaping at it like fools

Like a boss he completely ignored it and pushed us toward the window shouting ""JUST LOOK AT THAT VIEW !!"". The fact we were in the middle of a housing estate meant the view didn't live up to the hype.

We ended up buying the house. He took all of the pictures with him.

For about 2 years following that however we received mail every quarter from Amsterdam with catalogues for the latest extreme porn, a contact mag every month and a quarterly Swingers magazine giving tips on how to organise orgies etc.

Anyway, as I've heard it described (and remember, all I'll have heard are descriptions of US state laws, so this is going to vary all over the US), if a group of more than one person is shopping and they;re buying alcohol, the cashier is legally obliged to verify that the *entire group* is of legal drinking age, and if one person goes back to the car then, having failed to identify all members of the party as being of legal drinking age, the cashier can then not sell them any alcohol.

Thinking about it, I *vaguely* recall that this *doesn't* apply in the UK anyway, as it's legally permissible for parents/guardians to give their children alcohol inside a private residence (and so only the buyer needs to be allowed to make the purchase), whereas in the US it is *never* legal to give alcohol to a minor (hence the group verification).

MMeldrum put us onto this forum article that someone has started. I would like to say first of all thank you guys for showing interest in our project and starting to talk about us. 
@ieya404 We of course want to sell to people from the UK, and are actually in the process of updating our website so that it will be in both Portuguese and English. At the moment you will find that not all products have descriptions yet. If you were to take a look at our coffee selection you will get an idea of how the finished shop page will look. 

We have recently teamed up with a large wine exporter in Portugal and as such we have been updating the website to feature around 20 new types of red, white, rose and vinho verde wines and also several Ports. 

This is however proving to be a slow process and I hope you all can bear with us as we update and add more descriptive and fun content for you all. 

If you would like to talk with us please drop us an email:                        contact@amigosdosamigos.co.uk      

If you would like to help us crowdfund please visit www.bloomvc.com 

Lastly I will be checking this website daily so please drop me any questions on here that you would like me to answer. Thank you all very much!

What do you define as a stable society? Is our current society stable? Will it stay stable? What if changes in technology affect the stability of numerous industries? What affects the stability of a country? Does a stable society imply a near perfect society where we will never need to change anything again?

Life is not static, and as such constant decisions must be made as to how to run our society.

&gt;A small increase/decrease in tax or health spending has very little effect on peoples lives

This statement just shows how little you know about the reality of running a country.

A small increase or decrease in funding can determine whether there is enough medicine or adequate staff to save someones life and there isn't always enough funding, like whats going on with the NHS right now and what with the teachers walkouts in response to changes in education funding and structure, can you say you know more than numerous teachers and doctors across the country?

Why do you think the chancellor's budget makes headlines?

&gt;compared to all range of other personal factors.

All factors of life are affected by the economy and laws, what determines these laws? Who makes major important decisions that affect the economy?

And say if your an anarchist or communist who aims for a society without a state you must still govern your local community, do you think that every time a community must make a decision everyone's going to agree on an issue?

FSG have shown that they're willing to pay for top class players and just saying well Alonso is on X amount of wages so we can't afford that is not correct. Whatever amount of wages he is on is irrelevant to you and I unless it prohibits the club from investing in other players. I'm not sure you can make the case that it would given the state of the club.

Can you name another player we could attract who would be on similar wages right now? I cannot think of one. We lost out on Mktaryian and that shows where we stand right now without champions league football and without top class players in the side. Even if we paid him 150k/wk there's a good chance he still chooses Dortmund because of where they are as a club right now. Really look at the window so far... We've signed an older center back who hasn't really played in 2 years, a player from the second division in Spain, a player from a relegated team in Spain and Sunderland's goalkeeper. It's hardly a who's who in European football walking through that door right now. Basically we're reduced to signing reclamation projects and young guys in the hopes that they pan out. Xabi Alonso represents something else entirely. 

The line of thinking that we don't need someone of Xabi Alonso's quality because of where the squad is is just absolutely wrong and it annoys me to no end when I see it here. It's unreal to think that Alonso wouldn't walk into the side, regardless of who you have to sacrifice, and make Liverpool a better squad. Whether you play a double pivot with Alonso and Gerrard, push Gerrard up further or rest Gerrard (or he's injured/suspended/etc) there's so many ways to play it.

I chose Henderson over Downing as he would provide more cover when defending. Generelly this is a very attacking formation and Suarez, Sturridge and Coutinho would swap positions frequently to create chances. 

If Suarez leaves, i bet we'll play a regular 4-2-3-1 with Coutinho as 10. Wingers would be Downing, Henderson, Aspas, Alberto, Sterling, Ibe + marque signing

Anyone could form a company, gain investment and submit a Bill to Parliament. Since many MPs were heavy investors in such schemes, it was rare for a Bill to not pass during the peak of the Mania in 1846, although Parliament did reject schemes that were blatantly misleading or impossible to construct â at the Mania's peak there were several schemes floated for 'direct' railways which ran in vast, straight lines across swathes of countryside that would have been difficult to construct and nearly impossible for the locomotives of the day to work on.

Our council is in a pretty tough spot, according to an article I read a while ago we were in the top 10 for cities where buying beats renting and another quick google tells me our average rent is in excess of Â£800. We have a team who specialise in getting homeless people into private rented accommodation but LHA rate is at least Â£100 below market rate for a two bed - a couple of years ago tenants didn't have to make any contributions to the rent which made everything run smoothly, now we're struggling to find private landlords and we have about 25 people applying for every council house that comes up. A lot of our affordability checks confirm the trend in rent increases too, people having to move out purely because the rent and utility bills have gone up.

I'm too far up north to consider anyone from London anything but a rarity really, but due to position on GNER and excellent single homeless services we get an above average amount of rough sleeping which is another challenge altogether.

_________________________________
In 1946, Winston Churchill travelled to Fulton, Missouri, to deliver a speech and to be present at the dedication of a bust in his honour. After his speech, a rather attractive and well-endowed woman approached Churchill. ""Mr. Churchill,"" she declared, ""I travelled over a hundred miles this morning for the unveiling of your bust."" ""Madam, I assure you,"" he enthusiastically replied, ""in that regard I would gladly return the favour!""
_________________________________
Winston Churchill entered a men's washroom in the House of Commons one day and, observing Labour leader Clement Attlee standing before the urinal, took up his stance at the opposite end of the room. "" My dear Winston, I hoped that despite being adversaries in the house, we could be friends outside of it.â Attlee said. "" Ah Clement,"" Churchill replied, ""I have no quarrel with you, but in my experience, when you see something that's big and works well, you tend to want to nationalise it.â
__________________________________
While visiting America one year, Winston Churchill attended a buffet luncheon at which cold fried chicken was among the dishes served. Churchill, delighted, returned for a second helping. ""May I have some breast?"" he politely asked. ""Mr. Churchill,"" his hostess replied, ""in this country we ask for white meat or dark meat."" Churchill apologized profusely and, the following morning, sent the woman a magnificent orchid with an accompanying note. ""I would be most obliged,"" it read, ""if you would pin this on your white meat.""

There was a time when those who were incredibly rich were the only ones with extra weight and so at those times it meant the ability to provide and was attractive. In this day and age where food is readily available, being physically fit is now a strong indicator. Being fit usually indicates healthy genes and habits and that means strong offspring.

You could be an amazing person, but physical attraction is what happens first, and physical attraction is based off instinct. Doesnt mean people should be mean or people shouldnt be friendly to you.

Suarez-------Coutinho-------Borini

----------------Sturridge----------------


SUBS: Reina, Skrtel, Kelly, Allen, Henderson, Downing, Sterling, Aspas

The three in behind Sturridge are frustrating.  Suarez and Coutinho are obvious, but the third person is not.  Downing did well and I really like the natural width he brings us by being on the pitch, it's something none of our other players really do well.  But I think Borini and Aspas are just better players than him and much better suited to interchanging with Coutinho/Suarez, both of whom love to move about and find spaces all over the pitch.  I picked Borini because now that he's fit and had a great international tournament with Italy we're going to see the real him, playing with confidence, and he's a very good young player.  I can't wait for him to really endear himself to Liverpool fans with his work rate and intelligence.  I realize that having him in the first 11 is going to seem crazy to most, if not all of you, but I really believe in him and I don't know enough about Aspas yet.  So with all 3 of them having tremendous movement off the ball they're able to drift about really well and not be in each other's way as well as make huge pockets of space for one another + Gerrard to fill.  We saw this a little bit in limited fashion towards the end of the season when Borini was coming on as a sub.  He's sub in on one of the flanks and then be everywhere and it looked really dangerous.  Sturridge is always leaning on the last defender to help open things up as well.  Lucas and Stevie do their thing.  The defense is pretty standard and obvious.  I'm pretty much 50-50 on Mignolet/Reina.  I think Mignolet is a little bit better at shot stopping and a little less error prone than Pepe at this point, but Reina definitely distributes the ball better.  I went with Migs because it would be nice to eliminate some of those costly errors from last season, but really either one works really well, they're both top quality.",0,1373576906,null,0,false,0,cb0pvsb,t3_1i2skm,t1_cb0pvsb,t3_1i2skm,null,1430501164,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

That's not true, it's what you've been led to believe. We are group animals that survived for thousands of years as small communities working cooperatively. 

&gt;Why else do people go on and on about this issue when they a) don't do anything about it themselves (beyond of course put their glass in the right bin)

People are trying to do stuff but there is a massive campaign of indoctrination that controls what most people think and it's hard to say anything about industrial civilisation or capitalism and be listened to. 

&gt;b) know no one else will? The only benefit to them is gloating rights when the sea does come in.

This is obviously an obsession of yours. I don't think anyone with an interest in social issues and the mess created by industrial civilisation is looking forward to gloating. I think we are scared that massive upheavals are around the corner and the majority aren't aware of it.

My sister kicked him out because he dared to suggest she look for part time work, volunteer, or do an OU degree. 

She has not worked, or done anything at all to contribute to her community for ten years now. She has moved in her new BF (a complete scum bag who lumps my nephews about, slags off people that go to Uni, and tells my nephews over and over that if they want to do their A Levels, then that's what faggots and perverts do).

He works, when he finds a job after being fired form the previous one. :/

My sister wants a baby as soon as possible, preferably a girl so they can get a bigger council house. 

My husband and myself, OTOH, are currently renting privately and sharing with another couple. I work (full time now it's the college holidays) and am planning on going to Uni having completed an access course. 

We've been married a year and want kids. But we also want to be able to provide a great life for them, in a stable environment, with two parents who can work decent jobs and earn a good living. if we have to move abroad to do that, thenw e will do, and in the meantime, we're delaying it so i can go to Uni.

I'm 30, and very aware of my biological clock, ta very much. But if this is the sacrifice we have to make then we'll do it.

Can someone please explain to me why people ike my sister should be allowed to, and be paid to, shit out kids they cannot afford, they do not look after properly, and only want for the benefits, while we have to do things the hard way?

And please, don't tell me it's because it's the kids that suffer if we don't give them lots of money. My nephews do suffer. Last time I saw the eldest, he told me he wished he had never been born because he hates his ""new uncle""that much. It was fucking heartbreaking.
Seriously, can someone please explain how it's okay?

No way were we fighting for democracy either, most Brits early in the war were fighting to protect ""plucky little Belgium"", and the government was fighting to preserve the Pax Britannica and the balance of power in Europe. Committing millions of men to protect France was the worst way to fight the war, it took great chunks out of the British industrial edge and killed off thousands of specialists we needed to keep up with the rest of the world.

The first world war put a ""sell by"" date of less than 30 years on Empire, turning us from a country with a healthy surplus budget in 1913 into one of the most indebted, strike-ridden declining powers around, purely from military spending, and causing the rise of extreme ideologies across the continent to try to salvage some - any - point of the carnage. It battered to death Europe's idea of itself as the hub of civilization and superiority in science or philosophy, the only glimmer of good was the colonies started to suspect they could do better on their own after watching the enlightened imperialists take huge bleeding chunks out of each other for four years.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Major theories are that Hurt plays:

1. The ""Zeroith"" Doctor, something before [Hartnell](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/First_Doctor). That might mean he's [the Other](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Other) or just a regular Time Lord that drops his old identity and takes up a new one as the Doctor. The principle objection is that the name ""Doctor"" is a promise and Hurt's Doctor broke it, but how do you brake a promise before you make it? I think this is one of the easiest theory objections to get around.

2. An older Eighth Doctor. The principle objection is that it's totally unnecessary and kind of dickish to not just use [Paul McGann](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Eighth_Doctor).

3. A forgotten regeneration between the Eight and Nine we know, sometimes called the ""missing Nine"" or ""8.5"". Perhaps he's the one who ended the Time War. The principle objection is that the Doctor has never been particularly secretive about his part in the Time War or what his ending it amounted to. And if he's hiding something else, its proximity to the way he ended the Time War could easily just dull its impact.

4. The Valeyard. The principle objection is that Hurt appears sorrowful. He did things for good reasons (""peace and sanity"") that unfortunately weren't good enough (""not in the name of the  Doctor""). We've seen the Valeyard before and he's not concerned about such things.

5. The Twelfth Doctor. The principle objection is that Eleven knew about him, perhaps thereby implying Hurt is from his past and not his future. Also, it's a waste. Hurt won't be staying for long, so this entire future regeneration is being thrown away for one episode.

There are some minor theories as well. One unlikely theory that might be fun if true is:

* [Omega](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Omega). He once created a body for himself by copying the Doctor's, perhaps thereby allowing him to appear in the Doctor's timeline. And he's been traditionally depicted as insane; perhaps that ""sanity"" Hurt talked about is his own. He may also be one of the best candidates for a classic villain who might think he had a good cause but later expressed sorrow or regret.

Or one relying on somewhat obscure fan theorizing:

* A missing Third. It has long been theorized that after *The War Games* the Second Doctor was drafted to do some Time Lord dirty work before regenerating. A lot is made of the fact that we never saw Eight regenerate into Nine, but people forget that Two just spun into a black void. Was that really his regeneration into Three?

Just look at what happens when anyone tries to harm or threaten Amy. Dude turns into a 2000-year old Roman war machine. He would be an effective wielder of this power.

Agent Orange: Characterized by greed, the owner of the Orange Power Ring in the Whoverse could be none other than the Cybermen. The Cybermen seek to assimilate and upgrade all the other species in the universe. Ravenous in their hunger, they won't stop until everything is theirs- fitting for the owners of the Orange Lantern.

Yellow Lanterns: Who else could it possibly be? The Daleks. The most feared and evil race in the galaxy, their very name is enough to cause brave men to flee for their lives (for all the good it will do them). Sinestro has nothing on these guys.

Green Lanterns: Many of the Doctor's companions are Green Lanterns- in New Who, Donna, Amy, and Clara are all great examples. They're lanterns in the mold of Kyle Rayner, rather than Hal Jordan- not fearless to begin with, but able to overcome great fears in order to do the right thing, and help those in need. All have show the ability to be brave (and a bit pigheaded) when it counts the most.

Blue Lantern: Blue Lanterns are characterized by their ability to resist evil (Red, Orange, and Yellow rings), as well as their ability to empower the rings on the positive side of the emotional spectrum. Who in the Whoverse fits this description? Rose Tyler. She was able to defeat the Daleks, breathe new life into Captain Jack, and stop the Cybermen with the help of the Doctor. She made those around her better- Mickey, Jackie, Pete, and especially The Doctor.

Indigo Tribe: Surprise! It's The Doctor! Indigo Lanterns are, by their nature, healers. They fix things. Just like The Doctor. He fixes the universe, fixes the lives of his friends, fixes the lives of countless trillions throughout the galaxy- always healing, always caring, always helping. There is no finer representative of the Indigo Tribe.

Star Sapphires: River Song. Madly in love with The Doctor, but also a deadly and mysterious threat. River's who existence revolved around The Doctor, much like Carol Ferris's existence as a Star Sapphire revolved around Hal Jordan. Star Sapphires may be capable of evil acts, but as we've seen from the likes of Carol and River, they are still good at heart.",0,1373579593,null,0,false,0,cb0qzd5,t3_1i2w0i,t1_cb0qzd5,t3_1i2w0i,null,1430500647,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

2) 10 years

3) Started following the sport in high school. Really enjoyed watching LFC, particularly because of the fan culture and rich history...also Stevie was really emerging at that point and it was so exciting to watch. Down the line I interviewed Paul Dalglish a couple times for a local magazine when he was playing in Houston, and got to meet Kenny when he was in town one time. They were so cool and down-to-earth and candid when I interacted with them as a fan-journalist, and that really cemented my love for the club. Also got drunk with David James once and that was fun, although I don't really know where that fits into my fandom. 

4) Gerrard, obviously. Dalglish, Riise, Hyppia are right up there, though. 

5) American football, skiing. 

6) Tie between Bellamy, Jerzy, AC, or Dagger.

true,solve-for-x,,White Spirit. Tastes like blindness!,"Of course, pensioners in the UK are suffering from a mass delusion that their retirement has been fully funded by their ""paying into the pot"" all their working lives.  I'm sure many of them actually believe there is a bank account somewhere with all of their NI contributions sitting in it, waiting to pay for their pensions, healthcare and social care costs.

The reality is that pensions are funded by what is essentially a pyramid scam.  Each working generation funds the retirement of the previous generation.  There is no ""pot"", and most people's NI contributions wouldn't even begin to cover their retirement costs.

The trouble is, for this system to continue you need a) near-full employment, and b) a fixed ratio of pensioners to workers.  Neither of which we currently have.  Basically, this country is going up in flames while the MPs are fiddling at the edges. 

But when pensioners can outvote everyone else, it's much easier for politicians to smear soft targets than it is to openly discuss the real problems.  Why tell pensioners they're bankrupting the country when you can just blame the unemployed for not finding non-existent jobs?

Instinct is NOT what makes us judge on appearance. The luster of someone's hair is not some inherent way of determining good genetics. Humans do not have instincts. We have culture. And whether someone is rich enough to afford good hair care products is what really determines hair luster. As does their ability to afford healthy food.

Being fat is not some inherently bad evolutionary quirk. And as another user points out, being fat is smiled upon in cultures of old because it meant you had the money to buy good food.

Being fit doesn't indicate healthy genes. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't even indicate lifestyle because you don't know that person's circumstances at. all.

It doesn't even matter what humans' subconscious judgments are anyways because I'm sure that we still have the ability to regulate what actually comes out of our mouths, right? You don't spit out every awful thought that jumps into your head, do you? I sure hope not.

[1] http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/access/arealinks/#region/4/area/281

What Cambridge is looking for is spelled out on http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/ and I really can't add anything to what is there re: applying. Don't stress about choosing a college. There's no 'right' choice, just the choice you make. Don't make an open application. (That's one without choosing a college.)

Your personal statement should give an idea of what you're like as a person and what you find interesting. Don't stress about it too much; the reason it exists is so that there is some common ground to help springboard a conversation in the interview. If you can witter on forever about something that you love, slap it in the statement :).

Finally, don't convince yourself you're not good enough. You lose nothing applying and could gain a great deal. That being said, visit Cambridge before the interview. Ideally see some colleges. If you don't like what you see, that's OK as well.

Bull.

&gt;being fat is smiled upon in cultures of old because it meant you had the money to buy good food.

Pretty sure I touched on that.

&gt;Being fit doesn't indicate healthy genes. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't even indicate lifestyle because you don't know that person's circumstances at. all.

Incorrect, people who are predisposed to a lifestyle of that sort are usually healthier. Healthier heart means longer lifespan in general. Instinctually it also meant a higher chance of survival when it came to migration, battle, etc. There are tons of reasons why FIT is attractive. 

Not skinny, Not Fat. FIT as in being in shape. You can be skinny and not be in shape.

Choosing a college: Some colleges have a reputation for being the best at certain subjects, but aside from that there doesn't seem to be too much to distinguish between them other than distance to the city centre and size. Especially with the latter, it's really a matter of individual preference: At smaller colleges you can get to know almost everyone in your year, but at larger colleges there are more people doing your subject.

Personal statement: It should be mentioned somewhere in the prospectus, but the admissions tutors mostly care about seeing that you enjoy your subject - extra-curriculars (or a lack thereof) don't make much difference.

If you think your sister is abusing her children, you have a responsibility to report them, just as we all have a responsibility to report any crimes we witness.

Sure, there are some benefit claimants who abuse their kids. There are also some people in work who abuse their kids. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple (and multi-billionaire), had a daughter back in 1978 who was raised for two years on welfare because Jobs refused to acknowledge she was his - he even swore in court that he was sterile and infertile (he later had three more children). He didn't do much to raise her until she was a teenager. Personally, I think refusing to acknowledge your own child, even to the point of lying in court, is a form of psychological abuse. And do you think Michael Jackson was a model parent?

Needing benefits doesn't make someone a bad parent, and many parents who were in work when they had children lost that work and had to rely on benefits afterwards.

I personally agree that people shouldn't have children while on benefits, but that opinion clashes with all those Catholics who believe every sperm is sacred, and government actually has wanted people to have as many children as possible for some time because an aging population is causing a crisis of pension and healthcare costs with not enough young people to pay the costs in taxes - a problem that may continue for quite some time yet.

For most people on benefits, the reason they keep a pregnancy is because they will get extra money. I had an abortion ten years ago, and they tried to tell me about the benefits I could get ""for Baby""(fucking yuck, I despise that simpering way of addressing a child) when I told them I was not in a stable relationship with the father and could not afford  a kid.

please, don't think that religious people who believe in the sanctity of life make up the majority of people who have kids while on benefits. That could not be further from the truth.

true,HeartyBeast,cnty-uk,London,"Petty Ad hom? No, I don't think so, I was tackling the philosophy, not the person.

Let's go through this, shall we.

&gt; That stealing is morally reprehensible is obvious to you, right? If say, 10 people steal 99% of your personal belongings, and give back a stuffed bunny, does that legitimize the fact that they unlawfully took something from you by force?

Clearly that's wrong and I see you are determined to pursue the idea of all taxation being theft. Unfortunately, your bunny analogy isn't a very accurate picture of taxation.

In your analogy, who are these 10 people? Presumably they represent ""the state"" or ""the politicians"". In that case, since we are in a democracy.  You and I and our friends must have looked at their manifesto and thought ""blimey, this bunny-for-99% of my earnings plan sounds fantastic, I'll have me some of that"" Perhaps *you* didn't vote for it - perhaps everyone else did and we voted to take your bunny. And that's pretty poor. But if so, your argument is with democracy and the ability of the many to oppress the minority. Sadly that's a problem that's inherent in democracy, as Churchill said: 'the worst system' apart from all the rest.

In other words, if the voters have given the executive a mandate to spend some money on their collective behalf, it is not ""theft"" when they collect the money to spend, even if some people disagree. That's the social compact that democracy implies.

&gt; Just because a majority supports something doesn't mean that their support is lawful. 
For example, in most European countries, many people supported the systematic extermination of jews. Would you agree that their support was utterly immoral?

Fantastic, our first Godwin. 

But that analogy you make is very useful - because it bolsters my point that really your problem lies with the concept of representative democracy with binding decisions.

Of course, yes the majority can make appalling decisions, but to switch your quote around, Just because a majority supports something doesn't mean that their support is **un**lawful. A small town deciding to build a library from public funds, does not equate to the holocaust. The Swedish healthcare system does not usher in Pol Pot.

&gt; Government can never be as efficient as a private organization due to incentives. 

As I say, you take it as axiomatic that all governments are always less efficient than the private sector. And yes, often the private sector is brilliant. And yet, I'm reminded of the hilarity in [my neck of the woods](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2172849/284m-debacle-security-As-troops-Olympics-gap-did-G4-wrong.html) last year. Of course, the private sector does many things very well. But when the private business goes tits-up, then it is often government that has to pick up the pieces. 

&gt; If an insurance company decides to charge obscene premiums, other will do the opposite: lower prices in an attempt to find more customers. That's how businesses work, in spite of the communist propaganda you've been indoctrinated with.

I don't have my copy of Das Kapital to hand, but I'm pretty sure that in a perfectly unregulated free market economy, one of the rights of a company is to target which customers and markets you want to serve, you're not going to serve an uneconomic customer base and yet some ""customers"" are going to be uneconomic. You can drive costs right down to an extent. ""No MRI for you Mr HeartyBeast, take two paracetamol  and come back in a month"", but beyond that, well - it's dead people all the way down. And do you **know** the sheer bureaucracy that the insurance system adds to healthcare? 

&gt; Some people are too poor to afford quality food. Would you suggest nationalizing food production because of that? Of course not, because the market provides cheap food for poor people as well. And that's precisely what would happen if government got its dirty hands off health care: even poor people could afford it.

Would I expect nationalisation? No. But I would expect a safety net from the government to stop people starving. I expect you'll argue that, if only government got out of the way, charity would ensure that, but that's just stealing again, where the force used is guilt -yes? 

BUt again this is a broken analogy. If Leukaemia treatment cost the same as a Big Mac, your analogy might hold a bit more water, but ultra-cheap food and ultra-cheap medical care are not the same category of thing, no matter how you wish they were. You shouldn't get your penicillin out of a dumpster.

Over and above that, large scale preventative initiatives such as immunisation drives, benefit the whole of society, and clearly it is worth society mandating the government to fund immunisation programmes in order to avoid long term societal costs.  

&gt; If CEOs siphon off money from their company, then they get kicked out. But not many would be that stupid, since being subjected to market forces means that they must always treat their customers with utmost respect, otherwise they go out of business. Unlike government people, who can treat you with utter disgust!

I invite you to look at levels of executive pay and how differentials between chief execs and average salary has changed over the last 30 years. To what extent do you think that shareholder boards are functioning effectively to provide oversight of executive pay?

&gt; Rational thinking punctuates all matters I ponder, politics included.

I suspect you shield yourself from complexity and consider *idealised* systems actually. The kind of world where rational consumers have perfect information and can make perfectly informed choices, where everyone is capable of taking care of themselves, or perfectly altruistic charity givers care for them.  

&gt; Although I presume you've already made up your mind about nationalization

God lord no! Personally, I think that renationalising is probably quite a bad idea - I remember the curly sandwiche, dodgy rolling stock, strikes and delays of the 1970s. 

However the privatisation has clearly shown the limitations of the private sector - and it is this scenario that you need to understand before striding in with you 'government bad' mantra. When the system was first privatised, British Rail was split up into a private rail infrastructure company (Railtrack) which was in charge of the rail maintenance and build. Then there were multiple separate rail operating companies that were given franchises to operate the track in different regions. The idea was to create an internal market, competition etc.  Infrastructure and operations were split.

What happened? Well firstly you had continual internecine warfare between Railtrack and the operators. Whenever Railtrack (now renationalised - it went bust) wanted to dig up some track for engineering work, the operators would throw a hissy fit because it interrupted their schedules. Cue lots of finger pointing.

Secondly, what had been a single coherent entity was split into the warring operating companies. It used to be that I could go down to my local station and say ""a single from Penzance to Glasgow please"" and quickly be told what the fair was and which platform I needed to get on. 

Today, it's a nightmare. Each operating company runs its own timetable, and fare structures; finding out where and how much is a bloody joke. Even national rail enquiries, funded by the operators has trouble doing it. And then there are the other thing's we've lost. When I was a lad, me and my friends would go on cycling holidays, shoving the bikes in the guards vans for a couple of quid and away we went. Guards vans? Market forces soon got rid of those - now days you can't have a cycling holiday like that. Oh and fares have sky-rocketed over the last couple of decades. so faced with these sorts of issues people think wistfully of the days of nationalisation and wonder whether it would be worth renationalising.

&gt; One more thing -- look at 2 competing ideas as mutually exclusive: nationalization is 'good' vs. nationalization is 'bad; then take them to their logical endpoints and see what happens when every industry is nationalized, as opposed to a place where every industry is privatized. OK?

Once again, you're playing the polarisation game, and that's a mistake. Personally I'm in favour of a mixed economy, but OK. Firstly I'm not sure there has ever been a country where every industry has been privatized, but I guess we could try to imagine it.

I'd be sitting here on the Internet... well, no I wouldn't because I very much doubt that the Internet would exist since maximising  the value of the intellectual property would probably have entailed the patenting and licensing of IP protocols etc, so we would probably be using something like ISDN linked to AOL. The private CERN, should it exist would probably not be letting Tim Berners Lee release the HTML and HTTP specs unencumbered.

But anyway, I'd presumably be spending the evening phoning up various fire companies and comparing tariffs and capabilities for protecting my fire against arson, I'd then ring around the various militias and mafia franchises to check out my choices of law enforcement gangs. Then I'd drive into town, off-road perhaps, or maybe down one of four private roads running side by side, through the streams of industrial waste to meet a guy who could sell me some pills that he tells me are antibiotics.

Or perhaps I'd be wealthy and could just hire a nice big militia to knock down the houses between my mansion and the centre of town and create a private road of my own.

Everything nationalised? The Soviet Union. That was pretty crappy. I wouldn't want to live there either, but I'm not sure it sounds worse than the government-free scenario above.

Every time MPs pays come around you get all the usual rubbish with top politicians saying how outrageous it is to the press (99% of the people who voice these opinions are people who could be paid Â£0 and still live comfortably) and everyone agrees because people want as little of their tax money spent on people they don't like as possible. It's tiresome and harmful to politics.

MPs are overpaid, treating themselves to massive payrises in times of austerity etc. etc.

MPs have had an effective paycut since 2000 taking into account inflation. If they'd purely had inflation only increases since 2000, they'd be on slightly under Â£70K (this is as of mid 2012, the figure is probably above 70K by now). Yes austerity yada yada but this figure includes the 7 or so years where times were pretty good for everyone else in the country and everyone was enjoying decent payrises (particularly with all the money flooding into the NHS at that time).

Being an MP has only got tougher since 2000, more scrutiny, more responsibilities, more invasion into your private life.

Not only that, it's not a secure job and you're are very unlikely to become an MP in the first place (and have to put other potential careers on hold and do potentially years of work to get voted in).

There are few things worse than a politician in desperate need of cash but one of those things is a political system where you have to be rich to become an MP in the first place. No you don't want politicians doing it only for the money but if you're a normal person and supporting a family, without fair wages, it's not only unattractive to become a politician, it's verging on irresponsible.

Lastly...

This is a tiny tiny amount, even in the pot of public servant salaries and the benefits a more attractive wage could provide in terms of diversity in politics and less fucking time wasted in parliament arguing over this, outweighs the cost.",0,1373583944,null,0,false,0,cb0smxd,t3_1i2on1,t1_cb0smxd,t3_1i2on1,null,1430499866,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I didn't say that. I also didn't say that most people on benefits are Catholics. My point is that there's this influence on the country generally, and particularly on politicians, that limits what can be done to prevent or discourage people from having children.

It's far from the only thing - for example, human rights law - but that just adds to my point.

&gt; Oh, and the council estate my sister lives on is stuffed full of single parents who keep on popping out babies for more money. Seriously, that's more than one person, and more's the pity for the future of the UK.

If you concentrate a particular group of people into one area, it's no surprise that that area ends up full of that particular group of people. Besides, are you judging by actual statistics, or by the usual selection of normal human biases and prejudices? Has it occurred to you that the ones you know about probably aren't a representative sample - e.g. you know about them through your sister, who like most people, probably mostly associates with people similar to herself.

Also, beware of what everyone knows - [everyone is often wrong](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html).

true,lapin7,null,null,"I don't think much of this article at all. Firstly, he points out explicitly that Sturridge scored 10 in half a season for Liverpool (and doesn't acknowledge his injury/fitness issues) and then goes on to say the lad will never score more than 10/15 goals  for Liverpool. What the fuck? Do others think this? [It was 10 goals in 11 starts that he scored]

Secondly, he acknowledges that in losing SuÃ¡rez, Liverpool are losing their creative genius, one of the best creative players in the world. Higuain isn't the answer to that, as he says, so he just goes: Coutinho. People on here and elsewhere would put a lot of pressure on the boy but I've never seen this one before. I don't think Rodgers is going to put that sort of pressure on him either, I certainly hope not. Aspas and Borini, and Henderson I think, are grafters and great for the balance of the team, but there is a need for more creativity at the moment, I feel, and a massive need if Luis goes. 

Higuain scores loads of goals, absolutely, for a fantastic team who (with Barca) have a vice-like grip over their league every season and, as the popular perception seems to be, they are regularly wiping out most of the teams they face with large scorelines. Who believes he is going to score so many goals in a much worse team after his long exposure to the quality of Madrid? In fact, look at it this way. It is a testament to the fact that he is not an outstanding player that he is never spoken of in the same breath as the likes of Messi, Ronaldo, Iniesta, Xavi, Ozil or others  who have been prominent in that league recently such as Falcao and Villa. Despite scoring so many goals, does anyone even think he's in the top 5, 6, 7 players at Madrid? One statistic, in this case, can be very misleading. Am I wrong in asserting that his reputation is not of the top tier in Europe? People rightly consider 'systems' when speculating on players - does he have any relevance to our system? Maybe he's just a poacher in a monster of a team dominated by its winger. 

The analysis used to reach the conclusion that Liverpool need this goalscorer is quite shallow and unconvincing. We are all here very well aware that Liverpool scored a lot of goals last season, when we played well we hammered teams and it was a great positive improvement from last season. And of course several of these matches were without Luis SuÃ¡rez. Calling Higuain ""one of the great strikers of his generation"" is bordering on daft. Maybe I've got Higuain all wrong and Madrid fans would snort at me for all this. But if he was as good as is suggested, why would they swap him for SuÃ¡rez? Why would he be so strongly linked to a team like Arsenal, who are traditionally very weak in the transfer market, and few (if any) others?

I don't think he's good enough, I think he'd be a waste of time and effort. I'm definitely pretty biased because I've always just really disliked him for some reason, but still. Let him flounder at Arsenal. We need a huge creative presence if and when SuÃ¡rez goes.

I forgot to mention the question of why would he want to go to Liverpool? And what are the implications of that.

Edit: I'm adding in a bit more relevant statistics. Iago Aspas (Liverpool's new number 9, remember), scored 12 goals in a relegation-battling team who scored just *37* overall. In the same league, Higuain scored 16 goals for RMCF, who scored 103 overall. Do Madrid fans consider him a game-winner? Because Aspas was certainly considered one of the best game-changers in Spain last season for a struggling team.",0,1373585865,null,0,1373587128,0,cb0tbjv,t3_1i3akz,t1_cb0tbjv,t3_1i3akz,null,1430499544,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

 I've said this in other discussions. Mazacar, in all their greatness, would often slowly inch the ball forward until practically standing on the 18 yard line.

On certain fast breaks, they also did not make passes to strikers in more advanced positions that could have lead to 1 on 1's with keepers. Strange Torres runs were a problem that were really on display here. I think all 4 share responsibility for them.

I expect to get a defensive stop, transition the ball rapidly to the attack, and play balls through/across for strikers to run on to/head/strike.

My Mum was a single parent and we grew up in a council house. I guess the difference between my sister and I is that I knew I wanted to provide better, but she saw a way of life that required no effort on her part to maintain.

That's the failing of my Mum and society, I guess. I'm not sure how as a society we'd even begin to address it.

I'm sure, like me, you've got your own personal reasons for not having kids (at all or yet, your situation is none of my beeswax) but one I hear over and over is that there are already vast numbers of kids in care that need loving homes, so why the importance of having one that is genetically yours?

I really don't understand the absurd amount of overly sentimental attachment people place on their familial line, and think the sooner we can ditch that backwards way of thinking, the sooner we will all be better off.

Like macroblue said, it's pretty shocking that the writers included it in the series, though I must admit that I did expect it. I understand that the writers have license to play around with the story and the characters, but they couldn't change anything too major, like with Mordred. 

I think that the worst part of the ending though is how they ended Merlin's story. Leaving it open and not giving him what he deserved in the end was kind of like a slap in the face.

Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind... He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star.
Son of Mine: He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy.
Son of Mine: To be imprisoned there... forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her... but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror.
Son of Mine: If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that's her. That's *always* her. As for me, I was suspended in time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England as their protector.

Henderson and Sturridge can also play there, but I think Hendo is going to be playing mostly in the midfield and Sturridge as a striker. That leaves us with pretty decent options depending on what kind of formation we are going to play. If Suarez goes, I'd suspect that Coutinho or Henderson would play as the #10 with Aspas/Downing on the right and Coutinho/Sterling on the left. 

Personally, I think we'll play Sterling, Coutinho, and Aspas behind Sturridge in home games against lesser oppositions and we'll throw in Henderson and Downing in games where we need to be more tactically disciplined. 

All that said, we definitely need more attacking options, but I'm really not sure whats available to us. I think Bernard is a bit too ambitious, and Eriksen is more of a midfielder and would be unable to play out wide. There were whispers of Lamela earlier in the window, but I think he'd only be an option if Suarez left. If Thiago goes to Bayern, I'd definitely take a look at Shaquiri, he'd be immense.

.

&gt;**Episode one:** Carol is a tough single mother striving to keep her family together. When her teenage sons commit an act of random violence that ends in the death of a stranger, Carol faces the impossible choice of protecting her children or doing the right thing.

.

&gt;**Episode two:** Ying is an illegal immigrant from the Fujian province of China who sells pirate DVDs and stolen phones at cafÃ©s, pubs and barbershops around Brixton.

&gt;She must pay back her debts to the Snakehead gang, but when an immigration raid leaves her with no friends, home or money, Ying finds refuge with Jamal, the owner of one of the barbershops, and an unlikely bond soon forms.

.

&gt;**Episode three**: Richard is a recovering heroin addict who spends every day struggling to stay clean. Only one thing spurs him on; the possibility of re-establishing contact with his teenage daughter.

&gt;Faced with the prospect of never seeing her again, Richard is torn between returning to the world of addiction or salvaging the only relationship that matters to him.


.

&gt;**Episode four**: Kasia is a young Polish woman who originally came to London filled with hope. Years later she is still working as a cleaner, struggling to make ends meet and contending with a gambling addict for a boyfriend.

&gt;When tragedy strikes, Kasia uncovers a startling secret and soon finds herself in grave danger...

Visit many fan sites and get as many opinions as you can (they will all have different views on similar subjects and usually with reasons for or against in the comments) about all the goings on surrounding the club. Start forming your own opinions and get involved.

As you can imagine there is A LOT of history linked to the club, 135 years of existence will do that for a team. You should look into it and find out a bit about us, where we began, about the rivalry with our neighbours across the park, and the icons, heroes and key players from our illustrious history. From childhood to this day Duncan Ferguson is my personal everton hero and a true Everton legend. He understood what the club was about, what it meant to wear the shirt and what the club means to the fans.

Watch as many games as you can, both new and old. Even highlights and player reels can give you a feel of the Everton way, the types of players we like to sign, the personalities and work ethics. We try to do things the right way, we want to earn our rewards not just expect them to be given to us (looking at you Red Shite!)

Learn to be patient. Everton never do anything fast, ever. And they never do what you expect either. The easy games we should walk through, brace for the worst. And ignore all transfer gossip until it is officially announced (but don't be afraid to imagine the outcome of the ""what if he does sign for us"", we all gotta dream right!). We are prone to a mistake or 2 (recently Wigan in the FA Cup and the whole new badge fiasco) but it's our fragility that makes our victories all the more worthwhile.

Final thoughts, the club is obviously in a period of transition and things are going to change (for better or worse). You could be joining us in exciting times but you could also have a rough ride ahead, only time will tell I'm afraid.

You mean the ones that were first to close because nobody used them, the lines and building were falling apart, and it was difficult to justify running a service no one used anyway ?

&gt; The railways could make more money with them

They never did before ...

&gt; but once they were removed people didn't have a means to get to the larger stations, apart from by car

And yet people managed. You rarely read a story about a village starving because they had no rail service to get to the big city.

To be honest, I feel buses are far more suitable for rural areas, because they don't require maintenance and staffing of every damn bus stop.

For those of us that remember the late 60's (after the Beeching Cuts had taken place) but before all the old rail lines were converted into cycle paths etc ... British Rail leaked money and was not profitable. We lost a national asset, but that couldn't be helped as it was really more of a national liability. And now we've got to spend a ton more money reversing all the decisions of that last 60 years, because the latest generation thinks they know better ?

Nationalization doesn't work, privatization doesn't work. The only thing I can see is allowing them to be privately owned, but on the proviso that they are STRICTLY non-profit, and run with the service in mind rather than profit.

Hah, this reminds me of one time a few years ago working behind the bar. I was only 18 myself at the time, and a kid who was obviously younger than I was (16, maybe 17) came in with who he claimed was his father, apparently straight from work (this was around 16:30)

The father attempted to buy two pints of beer, at which point I asked for ID. The kid said that he didn't have any photographic ID, but did have his birth certificate with him. Needless to say they didn't get served.

&gt;You can legally drink beer or cider in a pub at 16 or 17, but not buy it, but try getting a landlord to risk their livelihood on a fairly obscure bit of law that the local magistrate will go ahead and ignore anyway.

Also, I don't seem to have a problem with tradition because of my background. That was just an example as to give you an idea of why I am against this whole JoseNotMou drama. Seriously, if having a particular nickname for one particular manager is what you call a tradition, then I fail to understand what kind of a shitty class you belong to. If a ManU fan call others a twat for calling SAF, Alex or fergie, I am sure, you will despise that behaviour too. How is this drama any different then?

I believe it's the creativity which gives us our goals, which is the reason why we brought in Coutinho and Aspas to give us that creativity. You can even see Suarez and Sturridge switching off depending on who has possession; they utilize a fairly fluid play style.

With that said, I think we signed players that give us the edge to get towards the final third and it's the creativity and movement of the other players that get us the goals. Usually, we've been playing a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with Gerrard and Lucas playing the deeper positions. The most important position is the creative '10' role, which I can see Aspas filling in/backing up for Coutinho. This leaves us with the 3 other forwards, which we are stacking up pretty well so far with: Suarez(if he stays), Sturridge, Borini, Downing, Suso, Hendo, Alberto, Assaidi, Ibe, and Sterling.

I believe what Rodgers is trying to do now is to provide competition with the starting XI. He wants a team willing to fight when they're 3-0 down(Istanbul anyone?).
