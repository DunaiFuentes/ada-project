What PRISM claims to be doing is two things:

 - Traffic interception
 - Direct access to the various companies servers

I would argue that GCHQ is almost certainly doing the first, but it is unlikely to be doing the second. This is because all the companies involved are US based corporations who have little choice but to cooperate with the american government. The US authorities could make operating very difficult for them if they didn't. However, as we have seen over the tax issue, these companies have very little to gain by screwing over their customers at the behest of foreign governments so why would they give them access to their (US based) servers?

However, GCHQ appear to be benefiting from PRISM as the Americans have been sending them intel reports based on information gained using the PRISM system.  ",0,1370854164,null,0,1370854904,0,cafse1c,t3_1g0c4n,t1_cafse1c,t3_1g0c4n,null,1430863690,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

One of the most recent examples is the new series of Arrested Development which wasn't actually pirated anywhere near as much as expected because it was available in a way the consumers were more than happy to pay for. 

People will keep on creating and keep on making money from those creations in the new reality if they take the time to understand it. Which mean that when we are facing a situation in which an industry lobby like FACT is directly involved in police investigations and a court system which is waving through censorship requests on the presumption of guilt I will not feel the loss of that industry.

I'd love to get a chance to talk to him and suss him out in person, because I am pretty certain all we have seen of him is him as product. I want to know why, maybe he believes in good things and presents the product over himself to try and promote them. Maybe he has other motives.

[When he was playing for Mouscron in Belgium in 2006, Ba fractured a tibia and fibula. He was out for eight months but when he underwent surgery, it is believed a nail was inserted into his tibia that touched a sensitive area of the knee when it was removed, leading to muscle damage. He had further surgery but the knee is now uninsurable.](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/rejection-drives-demba-ba-to-secure-rewards-8434322.html)

Papers have speculated that he could very well not be insured right now. Roman could probably pay off Ba's contract with his pocket money if he has to. Spurs absolutely could not.

Even beyond the insurance issue, I don't think Ba is good enough to be our first choice striker. He's 28 years old, and had a pretty poor record at Chelsea. Yes he did well at Newcastle, but the attack was focused on him and with the exception of Cissé (who disappears for weeks at a time) he was their only goal threat. At Spurs, like at Chelsea, that would not be the case. Then there's his £80k/wk wages, making him one of our top 3 paid players. Then there's the fact that he probably doesn't want to move unless he's first choice, given that he refused to even play on the wing for Pardew.

All things together, I don't think Ba wants Spurs, I don't think Spurs should want Ba, and I hope our transfer policy is more ambitious than this.",0,1370857779,null,0,false,0,cafstsv,t3_1g0akr,t1_cafstsv,t1_cafslqw,null,1430863412,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I understand that Google makes most of its money from Adsense, which of course is based on the principle of mining people's search habits, email messages and so on to be able to target them with appropriate ads.  So to ""do a google"" you would not only need to replicate all their hardware and software, but also convince advertisers to switch from adsense to neusense (New EU Sense, geddit?) to give you the revenue.   Or find another business model that makes it pay...

Even if you did replicate it, there's a good chance that no-one would use it simply because they don't care enough about the issues to switch all their accounts, browsers, etc., from google to neugle.

So even if you had the money, the skills, the backing of the government, google not breathing down your neck making life hard for you, and so on, I think it's probably still a thousand to one shot that you could pull it off.

And then, even if you did pull it off, you would probably discover that you had no choice but comply with the demands of the UK or US governments when it came to special ""anti-terrorism"" measures.  I don't believe that companies like Google would willingly hand their data over to the NSA unless they had no choice in the matter.

That's the problem.  At present we seem to have two distinct philosophies;  DRM all the things or no DRM at all.

DRM'ing everything generally ends up pissing off the people who are actually spending money on your stuff and is 'cracked' by 'pirates' a few minutes after you release.  

No DRM relies on people paying you out of the goodness of their hearts but seems to be good PR and keeps your fan-base happy.

Neither system truly works to the artist's monetary advantage.  

For large producers of films, music, games and TV etc there are other systems such as licensing the ISP or people like Netflix/iTunes to provide content with either microtransactions or a fee built into a customer's monthly payment.  For the little people though systems like that don't work very well.

I disagree; I remember during the end of Rafa's time here, along with the Hodgson era, we were desperate for an good LB. Enrique came in and gave that left side much needed stability. In the first half of his first season with us, we had one of the best defensive records in the league. 

Finding quality LBs these days is a rarity, and I would think it's a massive mistake to be rid of him. 

He offers pace and strength down the left, and on his day he's like a brick wall. Sure, he does have spells where he performs poorly, but I have faith that BR can iron him out. 

Another hidden benefit of Enrique is he adds to the Spanish contingent in our squad, which creates a better motivational environment for the rest of our team mates.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The Israelis have been fighting wars ever since their nation has been founded on the blood of the millions killed in the holocaust. They are surrounded by Muslim countries which went to war with them in the past, who Israel thinks are plotting their destruction. They face frequent rocket attacks, and believe that the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip was a failure which has only entrenched Hamas. They have a siege mentality whereby every action that does not support them is seen as an attempt to undermine them and facilitate Israels distraction.

Now, this is not the case for everyone, nor is it the truth. But what it does mean is that there are some pretty concrete and real reasons for why they act the way that they act, and it's going to take something substantive to make them change their minds. And by substantive, I mean America. Not a ragtag group of academics organising a boycott.

Israel doesn't care if a bunch of namby pamby liberals support them. They proved rather impotent at preventing the night of broken glass or Auschwitz after all.

Israel cares about security. That is all. There is no way, shape or form that this could ever lead to any positive outcome.

It does, however, add to Israel's persecution complex. The fear that the world does not care for them, and is willing to sacrifice them to benefit the west in the short term. This feeds the insecurity, makes Israel act out and makes peace far less likely.

The only benefit is that it makes those boycotting it feel better, like they are doing something, irrespective that they are making things worse, as well as placing 'pressure' on Israel and western opinion to demand change. This is pointless because Israel fears destruction and as long as we unconditionally support Israel's existence and safety, we have little pressure we can actually exact.

The point wasn't ""I have nothing to hide and so I have nothing to fear"" (I'd imagine dear Boris has much more to hide than most of us). The point was more that you were a fool for believing that your information was ever secure in the first place. Which is correct. The old adage *what's on the Internet stays on the Internet* doesn't only apply to the posters in /r/gonewild but to *everything* you do online. People need to start understanding this. If you want something private, keep it offline. The principle that your information is no longer your property when it is on someone else's hardware was established a long time back, by using 3rd party services you are *giving* this information away. Add to the fact that these are all American companies and are all hosted in the states and you are giving your information away with no legal protection. Which is his point about a ""British Google"".

Is it practical to argue for a British alternative to these established companies? Probably not. Is this the ideal way for the Internet to function? Of course not. Is Boris skirting around the bigger issues by basically saying ""you should have known better""? Yes, yes he is. Does that make what he said incorrect? No. We should know better but we allowed ourselves to get complacent and to start playing the game before all the rules were set. Now we find out the game is a fix, we shouldn't be surprised. 

His point remains however. The Internet is not a private playground, no one said it was (quite the opposire in fact) and you shouldn't ever have behaved as such.",0,1370863441,null,0,false,0,caftiru,t3_1g18et,t1_caftiru,t1_cafsbxi,null,1430863085,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I realise that this sub reedit is not uniform in their views, but when the overwhelming view of people here is at odds with the political establishment and a number of doctors, sociologists and leading thinkers, it might not just be because old people don't like it or that the home office are ignorant and 'don't like drugs'. They might actually have a strong body of evidence which suggests that legalisation does remove social and ultralight taboos, will harm the poor and uneducated most, and that keeping drugs illegal might be the best course of action.

Granted, I don't have access to that info,action, nor am I making that case. However, when a lot of people think something is intuitively a good idea and that people with facts who are paid to be informed are just stupid, often it is because both sides are not fully informed, not because we are 'enlightened' and they are reactionary.

Edit: [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) states with regards to voting: 'Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.' Considering this post has stimulated discussion and generated other viewpoints, while other meangless posts which have not and provide little positive material have not, I would only remind people of what those little arrows are meant to do.

I'll be the first to admit I'm going on a lot of presumptions but judging by Chelsea historically it looks unlikely that they will get a shot at being in the first team.

We simply need to make them the squad players but we don't. It's foolish and not even the seasonal managers fault because he can't stay there long enough to get to know everyone there.

He could go on other staff's recommendations but that's about it. We consequentially loan out most of our promising talent to either second rate sides or good sides in second rate leagues. Both of which tend to be counterintuitive to actually holding onto them as you're not giving them much of a chance to improve themselves is they're playing at a level they're already capable of. Hence Mancienne's move. Partially Matic (although he was used as a make weight rather than cast off as such) but he probably wanted to go given the lack of playing time he would get at Chelsea and the fact that Benfica aren't awful.

Other Chelsea graduates in the Premier League. Borini at Liverpool, Cork at Southampton, Di Santo at Wigan and Huth at Stoke. These players are all decent and probably capable of a squad player in the Chelsea ranks bar Cork. Historically, most Chelsea graduates have never gone on to play for more than mediocre teams. Mediocre being mid to low table top division teams either in the Premier League or abroad. Including the many former Chelsea players either in Belgium or Germany.

Okay, now your argument may be that the Chelsea academy is great now. We buy youth players at 14-18 who are twice as good as the ones we used to buy at that age. Well I hate to break it to you, that was never the biggest problem. We were okay at developing 12-16 year olds. At that point we had just as good coaching as other top sides and just as good exposure to top football. The problem came with players never developing past 16. I'm using 16 as an arbitrary age divider but of course I actually mean an arbitrary measurement of ability and am equating age to this which is of course itself a wild generalisation. We could loan players like PvA to Wycombe or Leighton Orient or even some lowly foreign teams. If we need our players to improve we can't simply send them to a league or team where they are already capable of playing. We need to send them to a team to break in, train hard and improve by realising how hard the game is at the top. Well now we no longer loan to really lowly teams, great right :) No, we loan players to clubs that already know who they are. That is the only way we are loaning people out to decent clubs. Vitesse have some connection to our club but I can't quite remember how, that's how they know our players and they take who they want really. It's not a step up from the Championship and won't prepare the players in any way that they wouldn't have with us. Many of the loans to Germany have been on the back of Frank Arnesen (was Sporting Director of HamburgerSV), the man who brought some of the youth players to the club. Watford took Chalobah because of Zola and WBA took Lukaku because of Clarke. Heck Liverpool took Borini because of Rodgers. (EDIT: should just point out that I know Borini was a transfer after he went somewhere else but I was just pointing out the Chelsea connections because I find them fun.)

Our players should not have to get by on personal connections but rather a Clubs connections. We are in dire need of a proper plan at the top of the Youth Academy. There is no doubt that there has been much investment but Abramovic has got to learn (Torres an example of him not having learnt yet) that Money can't buy you everything. We need actual people in charge. This is why the Pep to Chelsea thing gave me so much hope, I don't think he's a great manager but the reorganisation of our youth structure beyond pretty objects to a team mentality is really needed. What Piet de Visser and Arnesen did is beyond me, all they did was sign some youth like everybody else and build a pretty building.

The argument that the Chelsea academy is great now is relatively silly. If it was so great now, many more of our youth players would be making the jump to senior England sides. The only player remotely close is Chalobah and he'll have to wait for the retirements as he probably won't be ahead of Rodwell for a while but he is 18 so it's possible. If our Academy is so great why do we not see them being touted for an England shirt. Why don't they get into the Chelsea squad as rotation options? The Academy is part of a structure that is awful and by far the worst of any top 5 team. Even when we do recruit players with bundles of talent we can't turn them into stars like they should be because we won't give them game time. Preferring to actually buy squad players. No one at the top buys squad players unless they have to. We shouldn't and many would argue don't have to.

Now to the argument that, oh well, at least they're getting game time. Well unfortunately, game time in a relatively uncompetitive league pretty much surmounts to playing as the first team against the U16. Most of the time it's going to be easy. So what? They should put all their energy into improving and doing the best for their team. Training hard and building strength. Ok, now there are 2 aspects to this. Firstly, many of the clubs we send our players to do not have facilities any where near the standard of ours, I've often looked at lower division teams training grounds in wonderment at how similar they are to my local conference teams. This goes for the staff too, would I rather have the Chelsea staff telling me where I need to add muscle mass or some less qualified staff. The second aspect is a mental one, if you've spent the last 3 seasons training at Chelsea, grinding it out for the youth team and then you go to a foreign league where you don't really have anyone to look up to or have anything to drive towards then that motivation is lost somewhat. It takes a special sort of player to go abroad and improve drastically to the tune of what Chelsea management clearly think should happen and mentally many youth players lack this unsurprisingly and mostly without blame.

So what I'm saying to you now, is a summary of the aspects listed above. Many of our players are already being cast off, if Kane and Kalas come back with great development that is wonderful. They'll probably go back out on loan next season again. That may be slightly disheartening as well. Then they may gain some drive from it if they've already made improvements they might have the mental inclination to do so again. Fair enough. However, every time they go abroad, the scouts continue looking. We continue thinking about buying another right back (oh hai there Wallace) or who ever in their position who we think has more potential. And they may come straight into the team because the new manager knows who they are and how they play. Either way they've now got twice as much competition as they had before for a back-up squad place. Then eventually we decide to give up, or we don't and they go the way of PvA who is unlikely to feature as part of the Holland squad in the near future and nearly too old to be in the U21 squad (he is 22) thus he will pretty much be forgotten about internationally as Büttner catches and overtakes him now. So no, Kane and Kalas may not be sold right now. But they're not likely to play for us any time soon and it's best for them to be sold. Like Matic, allowing them to work as hard as possible, build new loyalties and a better career they deserve from the failings of our Directors.",0,1370864303,null,0,1370865946,0,caftn1w,t3_1fz6m1,t1_caftn1w,t1_caf9avj,null,1430863030,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I think it's a good starting point because the show actually underwent somewhat of a ""retool""/""reboot"" between the second and the third doctors' tenures; it went from black &amp; white to colour, which is nice; and you don't miss a lot storywise because the Doctor gets exiled to Earth and loses some of his memory, starting a new story arc where he works with an organization called UNIT, and there's no holdover of companions (except the Brigadier). So, it's somewhat similar to what happened with the 2005 reboot or Moffat/Smith's first season. Also, Pertwee's era is heavier on the action than previous series (it seems to be somewhat inspired by James Bond and The Avengers tv series), which I like. 

Overall, the old series 7 is a fresh start and quite modern in many ways, although the serial format is very different (there can be a lot of padding, but for some stories I think this format works better than 45-minute episodes; it can give the story more space to breathe).

You could use an open source email client with pgp abilities, eg the Enigmail addon for Thunderbird. though if you don't trust the OS that's not going to add security against those who have access to the back doors you believe there to potentially be in the OS.

Obviously he wasn't solely responsible but he definitely contributed. Before him we were dealing with the likes of Konchesky and Insua, and if it weren't for Enrique, we would have definitely been leaking goals. 

&gt;Uh, what?

Our South American and Spanish players are a very close group. They socialise together a lot whilst at Liverpool as most of their family and friends are in their native countries. Enrique is a part of this group, and him leaving would be one less friend to socialise with whilst at Liverpool for the likes of Lucas, Suarez, Coutinho, Suso etc... 

&gt;His decision making can be atrocious. His only asset is his strength and speed. His ability to tackle, pass, and dribble are all fairly questionable. He's essentially a professional sprinter that's been converted into a footballer, and it shows.

I personally think you're being harsh on the guy; when he's on top of his game he can shoulder barge pretty much anyone off the ball, and when he shields the ball he's almost impossible to dispossess. In addition, whilst in Rodgers system he has been making intelligent runs; for example in that awesome team goal vs. Swansea, or in Suarez's goal against Tottenham. 

&gt;I don't think he should leave unless we've got a better replacement lined up obviously.

A cross party committee recently called for reform and the setting up of a Royal Commission to look into it. It was flat out rejected by the PM. So while you are right that one person or one study does not make policy the government is flat out refusing to look at the evidence before making the choice on if we need reform or not. If you are right, and that our current way of doing this is right as some people inherently feel then why not back up that inherent feeling with evidence?

The answer is simple in my view, drug policy has long been dictated by moral reasoning and inherent feelings and to challenge that with evidence based approaches is as a result more of a personal attack on those morals and what a person feels to be right rather than a matter of policy. If it turns out they are wrong what does that mean for their value system and their 'gut' feelings?

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"I can't say your English is entirely intelligible regarding the Chalobah comment but I shall summarise what I meant.
IMO Chalobah has the best potential of any Chelsea player currently out on loan to actually make it into the first team. As for the nice player comment, that was actually just a comment on his development. If you're defining a nice player as the way they play football then I suggest that you adhere to the meaning of a subjective opinion like everybody else. Different people find different things ""nice"". Chalobah is 18, currently in the U21 squad. If he can break in to the Chelsea team this year, and the England squad and get some games for each he may well develop much better than any of his previous colleagues. It is what he deserves and he will work hard for it.

In this way, I consider Chalobah a nice player. He's a great squad asset to have if we keep him with us next season.

Thorgan Hazard is no Eden indeed. Neither is KDB but they're following a similar path and I would prefer to see Thorgan try and take a step up and improve. He may not beat his brother just yet but development at a top club could help. Perhaps a loan to Dortmund with KDB would be nice. I doubt our Directors would push for that given how crap they are.
As for ever playing football for Chelsea, you clearly don't understand the power of a squad and what it needs. For fucks sake, we had Geremi back under Mou last time, you're telling me Thorgan wouldn't be an asset in a squad ahead of Geremi. If by  regular games you mean 50 something+ a season (50+ considering this season we had an exorbitant amount of games and a thread bare squad). Around 6-8 players would make that mark. Only 6-8 players of around a 22 man squad. We played nearly 70 games this season.

I don't deny that Kalas could be a squad player. But we have Wallace, Ivan, Azpi who all play in his position. He may not be sold because he has promise as you suggest. But he should be sold because it's the nice thing to do. It would allow him to continue developing at a better club and he can probably get into the Reading team but I doubt they would take him on loan. PvA is unlikely to get the games he needs and is more or less a lost cause. It almost seems mean to me to keep him when he could be at a nicer foreign club if we released him. Although when I consider that's where Mancienne ended up he might just stay there too. Rotting in Chelsea loan purgatory.

As for your last comment on McEachran, you're just repeating what I said. I said he should stay with us in the Prem and work on bulking if he's not playing games and get the odd game in a 3 man centre midfield. But this is unlikely.if he goes out on loan, which is more likely, he won't need to bulk anywhere near as much and thus probably won't. Another vicious circle of loan purgatory. Given that he was touted to be a similar player to Wilshere but slightly more defensive, we've seriously failed him.",0,1370865620,null,0,false,0,caftu83,t3_1fz6m1,t1_caftu83,t1_caf8fkc,null,1430862936,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

This shouldn't matter. The police won't be knocking my door down any time for doing anything remotely illegal either (never even torrented, bought everything I own, no penchant for anything that would land me in trouble), but that's not the point.

He has delivered on what he promised, it's the other TOCs that, generally, suck.

The reason I ask is that I have a 8 and 9 year old son that recently got PC's for their Christmas. I got them hooked up with some decent filter (K9 protection) which does the job (until the become savvy enough I reckon).  This has not stopped the 8 year old trying his damn hardest to access dodgy stuff. 

I naively thought this would be sufficient, and let him have the computer in his room since all he was able to access were his games and youtube. I didn't count on friends from school filling his head with shit and then him attempting to search for it. He literally sat for hours trying to search for this shit, first on google, and when that didn't work, he went to youtube.

Thankfully, he did not get exposed to anything to risqué as the filter caught all of his searches and the stuff he had access to on youtube was no worse than a music video (i checked all the links he had clicked).

Now he is banned from his PC for another 2 weeks and it has been moved downstairs in the living room besides mine. Which is where it should have been from the start obviously. I just thought that having the filter would be enough but now I realise my stupidity. I was victim of the ""Oh, not MY kid! No way!"" I suppose.

2) BAE

3) AVB

So check it, we head out for a nice dinner at a unique, yet classy establishment. Just think of the combination of looks, AVB in a perfectly tailored suit, Gareth wearing a simple polo and slacks, as the humble lad he is, myself looking suave, and BAE bringing in the sophisticated, yet exotic and worldly vibe. 

The food is excellent, servers astounded by the magnitude of physical, star, and intellectual power at the table. GB is slightly out of his element at such an upscale place, AVB is a regular and has already begun using the salt and pepper as players to demonstrate tactics. Benny has brought along his pipe. 

After a fine meal, the next stop is a lounge BAE insists is the best around. Upon arrival, we are led to an ensconced booth at the back, furnished with pillows and cushions surrounding a hookah befitting a sultan. The hours whittle away as the four of us take exquisite puffs and engage in conversation that would make the Dos Equis guy look like Eric Wynalda. 

All is well, AVB creates new tactics, BAE conjures a solution to the plights of his home country, Gareth realizes he is destined to lead Tottenham to the top of the football world. And does.

He doesn't particularly stand out as a player sure, but his position is the one that tends to only really stand out when a mistake is made, or the team is doing really poorly and needs to be bailed out a bit defensively.  Look at how many outstanding performances Lucas puts in and we barely even mention him in the post-match discussions.

He's a leader, which is a really important and pretty rare quality to have.  He's also a pretty smart player and often displays a good understanding of the game and his role in the side for the youth and reserve teams.  He seems to be developing just fine in a position that is tough to learn and requires quite a bit of experience and intuition to excel in.

Am I positive he'll be our next Lucas and become an unstoppable pillar of our midfield?  No, not at all.  the jury is out on that and we'll see in time.

2. I think so. Not an in-form JD, like we saw at the start of the season, but an average Ade beats an average Defoe in my books, especially as JD started scoring nice goals from the bench.

3. Yes he can regain that form. He began to show it towards the end of this season. What a strike vs Chelsea! The lack of preseason with us, the injury in the first part of the season and the ACON all contributed to Ade finding form late in the day. With a full preseason, we will hopefully see a regenerated man!

4. That's tough. Want to hear what others say. Would be amazing to get off the wage bill. I'd say, if we were willing to spend big-ish to get a decent/ better striker on a lower salary, then sell. But if we get 2m, and then have to rely on Kane, then oh dear.

Yes, I do agree they are the same arguments, but within the recreational drug industry there is very minimal need to drive innovation. Despite the fact that 200 new substances have emerged in the last 3 years alone, only one or maybe two are a genuine improvement on classic drugs.

Perhaps this would be different if analogue acts did not force development of unusual pharmacophores, but if companies are performing arguably unnecessary research then they will need to push sales in order to fund this, and IMHO that directly conflicts which the whole aim of regulating drugs to reduce harm.

true,judgej2,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,"I was at one of Richard Branson's garden parties back in 1975 - the drinks, food and spliffs flowed freely. I was only eight, so I only touched the food, but it was a very hippy affair. Had a chat with Mike Oldfield, and he drew a sketch of me (with very long hair). Richard had hot air balloons, including one which he personally put me in for a small up/down trip, after the rather stuffy operators said I was too young. There was a crèche for the younger kids (my younger brother was in there), a swimming pool was open (another pool around the back of the mansion was still being renovated), a totally open house and the original Virgin recording studio, and an amazing firework show at the end. It was all very family-friendly, but in a 70's way, and nobody was forced to smoke anything and alcohol was not given to the kids. I remember the whole event like it was yesterday. Never experienced anything like it since. Richard - if you read this - *thank you!* - and just let me know what I can do in return :-)

I got the impression from the way that party ran, was that Richard Branson's approach was, fuck the rules, and trust people to do the right and responsible thing while exploring possibilities and adventure.

tl;dl: once talked to Mike Oldfield as he was rolling a spliff at Richard Branson's house party, which was cool.

Edit: a few more details for those interested. The party was an annual affair for all his executives at the time. He would put on coaches to pick people up from around the country and drop them off in the small hours of the morning after the party. Each exec was allowed to bring a partner and kids. I and my brother were visiting a friend in London at the time, and she had a friend round who offered my mum her spare ""partner"" place, hence next morning we were tootling off to the big house just outside of Oxford. Luckily that's not too far from London, so not a long trip.

I do remember two hot air balloons in the garden, one that went on a long trip, and the other tethered in so that people could take turns going up for an aerial view and coming back down again. I suppose balloons have always been a hobby for RB.

There was a hog roast and a beef roast going - took the entire day to cook those, but were very popular. I did not know many of the people there, but was introduced to Mike Oldfield after saying how I loved Tubular Bells (I asked him why it was called that, when the bells only arrived in the last few minutes of the album; he just laughed).

The recording studio was in the corner of the courtyard, and had an amazing mixing desk. There were some very nervous staff in that room saying the children should not be aloud in there, with so many things to break, but it just felt awesome to sit behind that L-shaped desk (you could around right around it - it was not up against the glass like you often see them). I recognised the same studio when Mike Oldfield re-recorded and mixed the Blue Peter anthem there a few years later. [Oh, and here is that very desk, in bits now](http://www.richardbarrie.com/Barrie-Enterprises/Original_Manor_Studios_Desk.html)

Food and drink was everywhere - staff and family just helped themselves to beers and soft drinks from big drums of ice scattered around. There was a marque full of tables of food piled up high - exotic stuff that was just not common in the 70s in the UK.

It was an amazing house, an amazing day, and amazing people. What an amazing guy behind it all!

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Preamble

I will start by saying I am a fan of Ade. If all of our players were playing at their full potential I think he would be among our best (alongside Vert, Lloris, Dembele and possibly Holtby.. Bale is miles ahead). So the question has to be why is he not playing at this level, which I will discuss below. Without CL football I don't think Spurs can attract a striker that will be drastic improvement over Ade, I would rather see funds go to a youth option.

&gt;Why was he less good this season? Could he regain that form?

I'll start with this question as I think it is the most relevant. Ade was a 17 goals, 11 assists striker when on loan, so what happened? Firstly, the class men behind him in VDV and Modric moved on, this is an absolutely huge loss because a midfield of Dembele/Dempsey or Dembele/Siggy is just nowhere near the same level of quality. Any striker would have a poorer season when the engine room behind him goes down a gear.

On top of this, he missed pre-season training, games through injury, red card and ACON. He only really got a roll on towards the back of the season which also saw a drastic increase in form. The Ade that spurs had for the last 2-3 months of the season is certainly a player good enough to lead the line, I fully believe that with a complete preseason under his belt (Holtby as well) and a possible upgrade or two playing around him he will go a long way in regaining his form.

&gt;Was Ade worth the 5m fee, plus his (reported) 110k salary?

Yes. His high salary is often used against him, but much of it is actually covered by Man City (via an upfront payment). Even if spurs held onto him for another 2 seasons and then moved him on, Levy could turn a profit. £5m for a striker is nothing, Ade is more proven then Benteke who is rumoured to be £25m+ or Michu who is at a similiar price. 

&gt;Is he good enough at holding the ball up to warrant a spot over Defoe?

Yes. Spurs best player is Bale, then Bale and after that Bale again. You want to get him on the ball in dangerous positions as often as possible. Ade can do that, Defoe cannot.

When Bale drifts in Ade is comfortable going wide, when a looping ball is hoofed up field Ade is better at getting under it. Both Defoe and Ade are about as good as eachother when it comes to making runs to pull defenders away from Bale. Adebayors best game in Spurs colours is when he made about 3 assists against Newcastle, that sums the player up well. He isn't a prolific goal scorer, he is at his best when he brings in the other players around him. Looking at his goal stats is always going to paint a false picture, I want a player that can involve Bale more and more in the game.

&gt;If we received an offer for 2.5m would you sell?

Nope. That offer would be a fucking joke.

&gt;Out of 10, how do you rate/love the guy?

I love him at about a 5/10, just because he is tainted by scum and doesn't have the love for the club that guys like Daws do. In saying that, I believe he is fully behind spurs and gets along with the group well. 

I rate him at a 8/10 when on form and 4/10 when not.

There's no reason the Severn wouldn't have similar.

Yeah, I'd assume the area upriver from the barrage would have a consistently higher water level than it does now, so submerging what's along the shoreline. A quick google lists prehistoric stuff like stone age footprints and some ice age sites, through to bronze age wooden structures, some Roman/Medieval ports, etc. I'm guessing this stuff is all pretty marginal anyway, but that's obviously no reason to just lose it all.

I think if the next doctor consciously did harm to people, willfully and recklessly caused pain I would stop watching. 

I am ok with Dr. Who exploring the dark parts and flaws of the human psyche through the eyes of an alien or exploring the morality of an alien, but if I wanted brutality and viciousness I would simply watch ""Game of Thrones.""

I honestly believe there is evil out there, murderers and rapists and child killers, there are people out there that like to see others in pain. I would never want to root for something like that.

De criminalising moves drugs into a grey area, we need to address the problems not move drugs into a grey area.

There are really serious problems with drugs.

1/ Addiction
2/ Acts committed to fund addiction
3/ Profits in the hands of criminals

De-criminalising will not stop people becoming addicts, it will not stop people doing bad things to fund habits and it will not take money out of the black economy.

The ONLY solution is legalisation.

Drugs would only be purchased from retailers using the under the counter system now used for tobacco.

This addresses all the issues, we have people in the open, they can get help if they need it, the drugs will be cheaper so funding a habit will not cost and arm and leg, the risks of variable quality will be removed. The black market would loose all the money this would be in the white economy not the black economy.

We could then use this to extend and restrict the licensing of sales all drugs, alcohol could be better restricted, perhaps even subjected to being kept out of sight, or with restricted display in age restricted premises/areas and so on.  The volume of drugs (including alcohol and tobacco) that a licensed establishment can sell should be set by the licensing authority, problem retailers selling very cheap booze or in areas with kids buying cigarettes could have their licensed volumes reduced.

now, he's an incredible potential (hazard like, although no where near the level at the moment) and i really hope he takes the loan seriously and works on improving himself. another drawback is that he is physically weak, and would under no circumstances be able to play in the premiership at present time. so that's another thing he has to work on improving.

I think this is good, as it allows us to (hopefully) take a shot at a young, unproven striker this transfer window. 

Honestly, what PL teams could field a better striker than Adebayor in good form? United and City have multiple strikers better than Ade, of course, and should Suarez stay at 'pool, he's better as well, but do Chelsea or Arsenal have a better Striker? I'd say Ade is better than any of Torres, Ba, Giroud, or Podolski. 

That said, Ade from February until the Chelsea match was just so unbelievably poor. Couldn't keep possession, wasn't getting into scoring positions, just painful to watch. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and just say he was having a poor run of form, rather than a poor run of effort.

What if they give us another difficult exam to aid themselves in getting rid of the GCSE?

Percentages,
time tables (don't see enough of these)
VAT questions such as 'Anna bought a car for £6000 plus VAT at 17 and a 1/2%... she paid £3000 when she got the car and paid the rest of the cost in 10 equal payments work out the amount of each monthly payment' (6 mark Question from November 2010 non calc)

Then the Daily Mail ran a massive campaign (imo, mainly because they have a 'thing' about Jonathon Ross) and suddenly there were 30,000 complaints.  Now, I'd have to suggest those 30,000 complaints were from people who the show wasn't aimed at, who'd never heard it, and probably had never listened to either Brand or Ross.  They were offended by what they'd READ about.

Their complaints are not entirely invalid, it's ok to be offended by something you've heard about after the fact, however, it was clearly an orchestrated move by the Mail to knock Ross and the BBC, not some move for the moral good.

The second option is simply to make the complaints line a premium rate phone number, then repeat Jerry Springer the Opera, Brass Eye, Jam, and anything else we can dig up.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Not in the slightest. I anticipate a lot of downvotes so I'd ask you to read this piece by David Simon first -http://davidsimon.com/we-are-shocked-shocked/  I trust the opinions of a man with a track record on critiquing law enforcement and government based on insider knowledge far more than those who claim I should be paranoid because they want me to buy  their newspaper. 

I don't have a problem with the system or what I know about its implementation (within the UK), it seems entirely reasonable and sensible to me. There is a lot of misinformation flying around which totally ignores the checks and balances which are in place when anyone accesses the information.

If it was being used to spy on ordinary people half the country would be in jail, really, think of all those you know who use street drugs or illegally download stuff - is this massive sinister spy network missing ALL of them? I know a lot of people who criticise the government, many of them organise demos. No one has mysteriously vanished. I can write David Cameron is a massive cock and he smells of poo. No one is going to come knocking at my door in the middle of the night. 

We are to believe the government is sinister enough to spy on our every move yet too lazy and apathetic to use that information in any way whatsoever???? I don't buy that.  

And even if a sinister thought-police does get in to power in some kind of coup, so what? Look at the amount of control Morsi's government had over technology in Egypt, yet the people still managed to overthrow him. At the end of the day ordinary people outnumber authority figures and most police and army and civil service personnel are good eggs. If tyranny ever comes to this country it will not be secretive, it will be marching, banging a loud drum and carrying a flag. 

People demand immunity from terrorism so they have to give up some privacy to obtain that. If you want law enforcement to be able to work effectively you have to give up some privacy rights. If you want to claw back those rights you have to accept doing so will put you at a greater risk of terrorism.  Expecting the police to be able to fight crime blindfolded is wanting to have your cake and eat it too. 

If you disagree with the system, fine, but please, it's not a sinister government plot, it is in fact the result of a general public that is demanding two incompatible things at once.  This is my only real problem with the whole thing, the secrecy is like a parent sneaking carrots in to their toddler's mash potato. If we could be adults and realise that law enforcement requires some controlled surveillance powers -and part of that will include the archiving of data to have it available in case it needs to be used -  that would be nice. 

As to how it might personally affect me, I'm not bothered in the slightest, our government may be inefficient and prone to wasting money but I don't think even they are dumb enough to waste resources on spying on me. Yes they may have theoretical access to my information, but I can't see any earthly reason why they'd bother to look at it. 

And being past the age of 5 I've got the basics of human psychology down so I know that if you want to be able to do something with privacy you have to do it in plain sight. If you want to sell your illegal Chinese Viagra substitute doing so through proxy servers and encryption bollocks will get authorities paying you close attention, if you want to hide stuff from the police/government stand outside a police station loudly proclaiming ' I am a criminal, I am doing a crime!' no one believes anyone would be so audacious. It's like when war criminals are found living in some village using their own name. 

If we are to believe there's some secret operation at GCHQ to look at people's private data, circumnavigating the usual process of oversight by the security select committees, the Courts etc, then it's going to be a very small number of people working on that. You can't run a top secret program without vetting employees and keeping a tight rein. 

I do not for one second believe that out of the 60 million people in this country I am even on the list of people they'd bother to look at. 
If I was a major celebrity with tabloid hacks willing to pay £££ for my secrets or a Chinese diplomat living in London I might be worried. As it is I'm not important and frankly most of the people acting paranoid have more problems with delusions of self-importance than any threat of any one in government noticing their existence let alone spying on them.


I am frankly amazed at the amount of boring, boring people who feel the need to announce on twitter every time they take a shit, who happily click 'agree' to give all of their private details to facebook games makers without reading the t&amp;c's who're now paranoid because the government - a body that is actually elected and accountable - with judicial oversight -has access to their data. 

The guardian report yesterday was that GCHQ had drawn on PRISM about 90 times since 2009 - so about twice a month. That's entirely consistent with it being used in counter terrorism work. 

I am very, very pissed off by the reaction and reporting of this for numerous reasons 

1. The hypocrisy of Americans who were apparently FINE with the Patriot act and FISA giving the US gov carte blanche to spy on 'foreigners' (ie. us) and are now outraged because they're affected.

2. The hypocrisy of those who've never had anything to say about demographic profiling, about the fact that a law abiding young black male is liable to be stopped and searched multiple times, the fact that a woman in a headscarf will be singled out at the airport - yet when a security measure comes along that affects WASPS they're up in arms. 

3. The hypocrisy of those who apparently don't care that the tear gas and rubber bullets being used to quash democratic protests in Athens, Cairo, Istanbul etc. are made in the US. Hey, if you want 'freedom'  for yourself STOP TURNING A BLIND EYE WHEN YOUR MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX SPONSORS TYRANNY ELSEWHERE. 

4. The hypocrisy of those who just shrug when presented with the proposed cuts to legal aid WHICH IS ACTUALLY A MASSIVE THREAT TO CIVIL LIBERTIES yet are running around like headless chickens over this.


Of course my Laissez Faire attitude on this presupposes that there's mountains of data and so they only focus in on stuff on a case by case basis. If they have some sort of software for filtering out funny cat videos, that would leave about 5% of the internet - then we're all fucked. The government will know we actually spent all day playing tetris when we took a sick-day for our 'grandma's kitten's funeral'

You claimed that the campaigns were funded with money not wasted. That means that the policing budget was directly cut at the time to pay for it.

I believe that to not be the case, to be a deliberate mistruth. In short, a lie, but I asked nicely for a citation because I may be wrong.

The money came from many different groups, health advocates and the government and was spent to help the general health of the population, not to reduce the crime budget. The fact that it will do so does not mean that was the initial intention.

You claimed that the money directly came from being no longer wasted on drug law enforcement. I believe that to be a mistruth. Please provide a citation backing your assertion up.

My initial reaction was shock that kids that age should be seeking out porn, but on reflection I think his curiosity is probably natural enough. 

Racking my memories, it seems like at that age the kids at my school (in the early 80's) all had a simplistic biology textbook knowledge of sex but no real understanding or appreciation. I knew that ""the penis goes in her hole"" but I couldn't imagine it.

I guess I was probably around that age when I was looking up ""sex"" or ""vagina"" in the dictionary, and not knowing of any other way to discover more.

So I guess, had I been born 15 or 20 years later, I would have searched the internet, too.

As I say, I'm no expert on parenting, so I'm not telling you how to do your job or anything, and I hope you take this suggestion in the genuine spirit it's intended, but I think maybe the only thing you've done wrong is that you appear to have punished your kid for his curiosity. 

Having installed a filter and ensured that your kids can't liberally access the internet's nastiest smut, you've done right. I think what's more important next is the conversation you have with him.

I think I might go with a line like ""nobody minds you looking at boobs, and I know I'm not going to stop you looking for smut, but there's some stuff you're just not ready for yet"".

true,atlwantsmls,num11,,"I know that a lot of fans want Adebayor out due to his performances last year, but I think that's crazy talk.  I don't sell him for anything less than 10m.

We have a striker that, when in form, could be considered one of the top 5 strikers in the world.

So there's no denying that he was out of form last year, the question becomes how do we get Adebayor to play at the top of his game?  

Well, for one, I think a preseason with the squad and starting the season in shape will go a long way towards a great season.  Last year, he began the season with poor match fitness, was gone for a few weeks due to ACON, and never really had a good run in the squad until the end of the year.

Also, I think we need to improve the team around him, specifically with players who can be a creative force in the attacking third.  Adebayor had his great season with us when we had Modric and VdV creating chances up front.  Bale creates a lot of chances on his wing, but Lennon, Dempsey, and Sigurdsson struggled to create chances (also Defoe when we played with 2 up front).  Bale also struggled creating chances from a central position for others (towards the end of the season, he would disappear for an entire game before scoring a golazo).

Even with all of our possession, we created our best chances on the counter or coming off of Bale's left foot from 25-30 yards out.  Honestly, how many chances in the box did we really have last year?  Our lack of penalties also show that we were never a threat in the middle.

Because of our lack of central attacking threat, we saw Adebayor play much deeper than he usually likes to.  His hold up play was pretty good in these situations, but let's face it, he isn't scoring a goal 45+ yards away with his back facing the goal.

I think next year, we could be an absolute force with Bale playing in a central attacking role and being as much of a creator than a goalscorer.  It seemed like this year, Bale playing a free roaming position kinda made the other players play on their heels a bit, as we didn't really know where to be or how to attack in such a fluid formation (that's why we're so effective on the counter, when the runs are pretty straightforward).  Giving Bale a more central role and giving him an offseason to work on his chance creation from a central role will be very valuable (think of all the times other teams will commit to his left footed shot from distance which gives TONS of space behind the pressing man).

Give me a front three of Adebayor, Bale, and Villa and oh goodness the goals would be glorious!  ",0,1370872413,null,0,false,0,cafv7eq,t3_1g1gz7,t1_cafv7eq,t3_1g1gz7,null,1430862291,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I forgot to mention that the first time this happened was back in April. We dealt with it then and the thing that upset us most that he had not approached us regarding his curiosity (totally unreasonable, I know - who the fuck asks their mum and dad what happens when two girls have sex).

This was during a time he was lying, and we were quite upset about the fact he was carrying out all these searches when his 5 year old sister plays in the room watching TV and whatnot. We talked to him about it, and about approaching us if he has any questions. He did not have access to the net for 1 week - he could only use Steam in offline mode.  I explained to him that it's natural to be curious but the things that he can get exposed to can not only disturb him but have serious repercussions if he picks up some sort of virus. 

So, after a week he got his PC back and things went on okay. I just assumed he would do what he was told. Big mistake. I checked his history a couple of weeks ago and found out that he had just resumed searching the very DAY he got his PC back. While I can understand him being curious I am just not going tolerate him disobeying us so explicitly. Especially when he got caught the first time so easily and told that I will always find out.

This punishment is not for the smut so much as the fact that he deliberately searched again when being told it's unacceptable (especially with young girls around). 

He is a tool sometimes. I can just imagine him sitting there thinking ""Aha! Ill never get caught *this* time, Dad!""

In form, he is in that group of players behind the 2 guys who are far and away the best in the world (along with Bale).

Bale's goal scoring was helpful, but we were tactically poor for large stretches of games waiting for magic from Bale's left foot.  No team play, poor off the ball runs...just sit back and watch Bale.  Luckily, he came through more often than not, but we need to be less one-dimensional and predictable.

Bale being more of a creator still shouldn't take his chances away, instead it just adds a greater threat to his abilities.  

For us to be successful, we need that central creator.  There's 3 ways that's going to happen: 1) Bale becomes that 2) Someone else on the team emerges in that role (Siggy, Dempsey, Holtby, Dembele) 3) We buy someone.

Thor has the best chance of the players on the team to play in that role, but I don't rate his creative abilities very high.  Dempsey's forte is hard work/poaching and his creative ability is underrated, but that would still be forcing a square peg in a round hole.  Holtby and Dembele are best served in a deeper position and serve us best in converting possession into attack and not in chance creation.

If Bale truly is world class, he will improve on creating chances for his teammates from a central position, which is much more effective than his chance creation on the wing (due primarily to his pace).

In my opinion this should come down to almost everyone else on the field. Bale was pulling his weight. Dempsey and Lennon, not so much. Those are the guys who should make way for the creative types.

Dembele - Sandro - Holtby

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"1. I think it was a fantastic deal on Levy's part not only to get the reduced fee but to get City to fund the wages.  On the basis of pure business it was absolutely fantastic.  We have taken shots on players for more and gotten less, this was a relatively painless gamble to take.

2. When it comes to holding up the ball Ade is certainly better than JD. JD on form is a lights out striker who can seemignly score at will but isn't a hold the ball and show creativity type of striker he is going to move to get into shooting position and let fly, that said he can hold the ball up better than i would expect him to. Ade on the other hand can hold up the play and shows some (limited and sometimes questionable) creativity when distributing the ball. 

3. Personal opinion is that Ade's struggles were more mental than anything but i think those mental issues stemmed from his injuries and lack of time with the team. When Ade is interested, motivated and confident he is a top quality player.  The problem arises when any one of those three things is off because his whole game collapses and his consistency goes out the window.  When his confidence is up he is a nightmare for other teams, he works hard and constantly seems to be in a threatening position.  When his confidence is down he seems sluggish and in some game you generally wonder if he wants to be out on the pitch. I think he could regain his form, but he seems to be a high maintenance player (granted not a rare thing in a striker), we can ask if he can regain his form and how good he can be for us but we need to keep in mind the possibility that his form could drop at any moment and we would be then have a striker who can't score. 

4. 2.5m would be a shade low for me, i have seen rumors of 5m which i would take without hesitation.  Ade on his day can be outstanding, but his consistency is just poor (even when he is on form).  I don't know that he will react well to Spurs picking up a striker and cutting into his time on the pitch, that seems to me that we would get a sulky unmotivated Ade. For this reason if we got an offer in the 4.5m-6m range i would push Ade on to another team where he could be the star.  He is a good player, we just need better.

5. out of 10 i would rate him 7. Better than an average striker who on his day is top level.  Mentally he has his slips and they lead to a drop in his performance that we cannot afford to have this upcoming season.

Just going to quote [Chuck Wending](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/06/03/why-its-time-to-genderflip-doctor-who/) on this one:
&gt;Some people said — “Well, why not make the supporting characters be strong female characters?” That’s tokenism. Putting a black dude in your TV show — oh, ho, ho, not as the lead character, mind you — because you need a black dude for your “demographics,” that’s tokenism.

And as for your bullshit Ripley argument -- Is there ANYTHING in the Alien mythology that suggests that Ripley can change gender? Is there? And is there a problem with guys getting cast as leads? I mean that never happens right? Guys getting cast as the lead? And as much as I love Rose and River --- they fail the [Bechdel test](http://bechdeltest.com/) EVERY time.

&gt;It might be more correct to say that most ppl don't read enough history or philosophy or hard science, or have the critical faculty necessary to understand just what a disastrous threat the continuation of theism presents.

So... charity is irrelevant, but your IQ and pay packet is? I am not saying you aren't intelligent enough to make an attack on theism, i'm saying that you aren't by default right because you have digested more information because there are plenty of theists who are clever and well educated. You are essentially taking the position that *If only everyone was as clever and well educated as I, they couldn't help by agree with my position*, which is patently untrue. 

In any case you haven't even mounted an argument as to why theism is a threat. Perhaps it's worth pointing out that atheist leaders have killed many many more people than all the religious combined? Probably not, because you'll hide behind the old cliche that you can't be linked together... nevertheless, the absence of religion really served Cambodians and the Chinese well, didn't it?

true,cacafogo,num5,,"Adebayor is well known as a finicky player.  When he is on, he is almost unstoppable, but when he isn't doing well he loses interest.  This makes a weird cycle where he is doing well so he enjoys it and tries harder, and therefore continues to do well.  On the other hand, it also leads to stretches where he gets lazy; he walks around more and his first touch suffers.

He was fantastic for us on loan, no one can deny that.  This year wasn't nearly at that level.  He came into the team late, and while he was here the previous year half the team had changed (including the loss of Luka and Rafa, which would hurt any striker that had been in front of them).  He also had a lot of injury trouble early on, and in January got taken out for the ACON.  All of this conspired to knock him off his game, and for a player like Ade that is devastating.  It didn't help that the fans weren't behind him either, because an Ade that feels loved plays better than an Ade that is unwanted.

He is currently our best striker, even during his ""lazy"" games.  We look like a better team when he is on the pitch.  Some people rag on him for going wide and want him to get into the box (including commentators all the time, so annoying), but that is actually a quality that complements our current style.  We often lack width apart from our fullbacks and he provides it farther up the pitch.  That also means our wingers that are going to drift in anyway have space, and if Bale continues in the center it opens the door for him to push up as well.  There are more aspects of his play that really help us, like his size on spot kicks (Defoe will never even try to win a battle for an aerial ball), hold up play, movement to draw defenders out of position, etc.

If we judge solely on last season, then he was not worth the absolute steal of a fee.  We still have him though, and he can (and I think will) still prove his worth.  No way in hell we take less than a profit to sell him, and I would not want to see that happen.  I think we will see the Adebayor of his loan spell, and the end of the season, again, even if only for a few games.

The vast majority of people that drive completely competantly on the motorway, do so without having had any motorway specific tuition.


Everything you need to know is covered in the highway code, and the skills you need to control the vehicle and make manouvers safely are taught and tested. Just because you've never actually driven on the motorway, doesn't mean you automatically forget everything you've learned elsewhere. 

But the people your speaking of (the middle lane dawdlers that feel like they're getting punished), are the ones that know what they're doing. They chose to sit in the middle lane, and get all shirty and defensive when they're told they're in the wrong.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I don't have it. But that is a decent enough reason for why someone would want to prevent the debate from happening. The people who decide whether to have a debate have looked at the infomation and decided not to have that decision.

Not having evidence for a policy is a reason not to debate the worth of that policy? More you are saying that the debate isn't worth having because we are not currently having it? Really?

&gt;We draw arbritrary lines in the sand not because it is perfect but because it is better on a utiliarian basis.

If they are arberty then why keep them if they are shown to be more harmful than another, achievable, approach?

&gt;We do not live in the whiggish world where everything leads to progess.

But if progress is made in our understanding we shouldn't adjust policy to take account of that new understanding? 

&gt;What if we had the facts which showed that Cannabis should be legal despite being a gateway drug with which the taboo around drugs would be reduced, resulting in more people taking worse drugs? In such a situation, everything is made worse than if the debate was ignored from the start.

Firstly cannabis leading to the use of other drugs is only harmful if those other drugs are. Part of the 'facts' that we would have to take into account before making the drug legal is if this was the case and if it is is the current prohibition more harmful to us over all than the new one in that light. This is the kind of broad evidence base review we need and if it's felt that prohibition is best then so be it... I highly doubt that's the case but I can't argue evidence based policy if I don't agree to be bound by evidence.     

&gt;We have a solid body of individuals who look at this and decide what is the best course. If they decide not to investigate it is possible they are doing so for the benefit of society, not just laziness

So you dismiss the cross party committee as being nothing but advisers to the government and then state that the government is only listening to it's advisers? K.

That or this is another drunk 3AM idea.

I'll play and love the concept (and I see I've been challenged...challenge accepted)

There's a few different ways I can go with this.  One part of me wants to invite just AVB and Freund to watch them play FIFA.  I'd set the defensive abilities to zero and attacking abilities to 100 so that the game is suspended with Steffan Freund ahead 235-231.  Both coaches have passed out with minutes left in the game due to exhaustion from celebrating every goal with fistbumps, gravity defying jumps and total mayhem.  Meanwhile, I sit with Gareth Bale and we've turned watching the FIFA game into a drinking game where we take shots when they score.  As I get more drunk, I ask Gareth Bale if there's anything I can do to get him to stay.  *Anything*.

The next day, newspapers and fans all over the world are in confusion as the official website announces that Gareth Bale has signed a lifetime contract to play for Spurs and I'm wondering why [this image](http://www.ipo.gov.uk/trademark/image/GB50000000002657917.jpg) is tattooed on my lower back.  Don't worry, this OP will deliver with proof.

Now another way I can go is business related. I would go with Daniel Levy, AVB, and whomever the analytics guy is.  I would tell them the virtues of my soccer analytics company and how, using us, we can guarantee that the glorious club of Tottenham Hotspur will rule the world.  Or qualify for Europe.

Personally, though, I think I would go with AVB, Levy, and Bale.  The dinner would be in the middle of White Hart Lane.  The voice of the ghost of Bill Nicholson will be echoing fantastic quotes about Spurs throughout the stadium.  We chit chat about Spurs, some of Bale's great goals, and who we're going to be rumored to sign this summer (with Levy creepily laughing every time a player valued more than 8million gets mentioned).  As more drinks are consumed, I turn to Gareth Bale and ask him if there's anything I can do to get him to stay.  *Anything.*

 Having your meals cooked for you sounds great, right? And the breakfasts are amazing! Unfortunately though if you are lazy you will need to be up and dressed before half 10 every week day to get it, which isn't always easy after a heavy night at the hive. As for dinner, the quality of food varies significantly depending on how much leftovers they have from the previous few days (the croissants from breakfast featured for dinner with a mushroom sauce a good few times). The diner times last year were 5:00-7:30, but really most of the food is gone by 7. The food and hours were so bad that me and my friends ended up wanting to cook for ourselves most of the time. Given that the only cooking facilities in the pantries are a dirty microwave and toaster our options were fairly limited. And if you need to leave any food in the pantry or the fridge it is likely to get stolen. It happened to everyone and was a major problem.

Having a cleaner also sounds like a dream. It's pretty good but be prepared to get up at nine one day a week to let the cleaner into your room, or at least to arrange a time for it to be cleaned. The cleaners have to check for prohibited items such as candles and posters on the wall as part of their job so you'd have to hide them once a week. Although my cleaner was a lovely lady it did feel like I was getting weekly room inspections. 

The location of Pollock halls is also quite far out. It's roughly a half hour walk to Princes street, and 20minutes to George square. Most of the self catered flats have far better locations.

If you do decide to go for Pollock halls I would recommend John Burnett house. I stayed in Holland and was disappointed at the quality of the facilities for the large amounts of money I was paying. John Burnett just has a far better quality of everything, they even have tables in their pantries! It's really lovely.

Hurt is clearly a reincarnation of the Doctor, but which? I think that he is a reincarnation in the past that was wiped from the Doctor's time line by himself (Hurt). Hurt was the reincarnation that did the unthinkable, ending the Time War. He effectively committed genocide of various species, including his own, by locking them in a bubble of time for all eternity. It is likely that the bubble can be opened by any Time Lord, but the Doctor had locked them all away. It is also likely that Hurt tried to lock himself in the bubble but was saved by the TARDIS. My thought is that after he placed the lock, and was saved against his will, it was too risky to open it up and try to trap himself again. After the TARDIS intervened he likely went to Trensalore, the place of his grave, and entered his own time line to remove himself from all points in history. These acts would then only be known to him and assumed by the rest of the universe. It would be one of the reasons he is known to be removing himself from all known databases. He then forced himself to reincarnate into a form of the Doctor that we are more familiar with, between the 2nd and 11th reincarnation. Effectively he would have reincarnated twice at once at one of the points, all in one sequence, appearing to have never become Hurt.

The UK has some of the safest roads in the world, far better than most countries.

Also, you need to consider how you expect drivers to cope with other types of roads; if you are going to expect people to be tested on motorway driving, then surely you also need people to be tested on the other sorts of roads too?  (e.g. single track with passing places?).

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;!) I'm saying the government has the infomation and evidence, which is why they arent having the debate.

Except parts of the government are directly call for that debate. What you mean is that the ruling party disagree with the need for it. Which doesn't have to have anything to do with the evidence if they are not interested in an evidenced based policy. 

In this case the idea that a conservative government would, without question, choose to review drug policy when it would (unlike branson thinks) destroy them politically is mind numbingly naive. Have you not been watching the gay marriage debate? The party is at civil war with itself over something that is about as cut and dry as it can get because of personal moral and religious issues. If they are willing to rebel over their leader doing that, which wasn't part of their manifesto, can you even begin to imagine what would happen if he introduced a royal commission to look at reviewing drug laws? 

&gt;2)Do you know what a shilling point is? That is why we set arbritrary lines along what I said

I have to say I don't, and nor does google, you said we set up arberty lines so I fail to understand how moving those lines is unthinkable given that they are... well... arberty. 

&gt;3) Sure, but the government can evolve its position without decriminalisation or without ordering new studies every single time it comes up. Evolution is a constant, unless the new evidence is paradyme shifting, they are not obligated to change everything because one bloke or one committee decide to do so. Those committes have the right to suggest it, but the government is entitled to tell them to bugger off.

Again you are setting up a straw man of ""they can so they should and you have no right to tell them they can't"" which is ridiculous. All I'm saying is that there is a growing body of evidence that, if the policy is intended to be evidence based, will need reviewing at some point. Again I'll point you to above where the ruling party has other influences on what they choose to do than just evidence. 

Take our economic policy, there has been the paradigm shifting change you insist needs to take place, including the discrediting of one of the major ""papers"" the government loved pointing to to support their position.... the result? Doubling down on the ideological base of that policy because doing anything else would have to have them admit they were wrong and who the fuck is going to elect them after they admit the other side was right?

&gt;4) Again, Schilling points

Not finding anything on google for this version either. My guess is that this is something to do preventing slides down slippery slopes... well what if turns out there isn't a slope at all?

&gt;5) Well, the government have evidence, advisors, experts, and supporters in addition to the Lords. I am saying they can listen to the former while ignoring the latter.

They can but to suggest that the fact they are is proof they should is bullshit circular reasoning.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I thought Siggy chiming in from the left was one of the most potent attacking threats spurs had last season.

In 3 games where he started in AML he chalked up 2 goals and 1 assist. He also played 5 games a little deeper (but on the left) and got a further 2 assists. 8 played, 2 goals and 3 assists isn't bad stats. It also allows Bale to free roam (and I would personally put him on the right with the power to drift into the middle).

From the right/centre Bale played 14 and scored 12 + assisted 4. I see no evidence as to why Siggy on the left and Bale on the right (cutting in as the 'inverted winger') wouldn't work.

&gt;he still has a long way to go

Siggy is 23, it isn't an issue that he has a long way to go, he is a player for the future. I believe that with game time under his belt those 8 games played a season will turn to 40 games played, extrapolating those stats you are looking at about 10 goals and 15 assists. I know you can look to far into stats, but with what I have seen from Siggy 10 goals + 15 assists seems pretty accurate.

&gt;A lineup with both Holtby and Siggy right now would not be a consistently winning side.

With a full pre-season and actual defined roles (I feel they floated around a bit last season) I don't know why they can't both work together.

For me, the 4-3-3 I gave above would be potent.

And what the hell? Tokenism? I get that there's a bit of that, but I think you are not giving enough credit to most of the serious writers who do genuinely create strong female characters.

Your response to the Ripley argument is so much more bullshit, because I'm not basing it off the mythology. In a series reboot, you can do anything.

The first christmas special just after series 1. The second after series 2 (etc) 

After that, you have the specials between series 4 and 5 (there are 4) where 10 travels alone for a while.  

Those are all relevant to the plot, or almost all anyway, definitely worth at least one watch through. 

Then there are other specials, mostly concerning Children in Need. There's one just after Series 1 and before the first christmas special. (about the regeneration of 9 -&gt; 10). Then there's another one about 10 meeting a past incarnation. There are tons more though and since series 5 there are a lot more. I think the small specials are all on youtube though, so you can watch them there.

Series 5 and 6 (maybe 7, don't know) have extras, clips that were removed, although still worth a look. Which reminds that there's also a series 3 extra about the series 3 episode Family of Blood. 

Other than that for series 7 there are also a few prequels floating around (or parts of the story that didn't make the screen). Such as Pond Life (before series 7, after the christmas special of 6), PS (after episode 5 of series 7), The Great Detective (before the christmas special of series 7 which is mid season, so after PS), He Said She Said (before the last episode of Series 7)

And then, when the time comes (23 November 2013) there will be the 50th anniversary special. Of course, there will be a lot more in that month than just that, so you'll have to keep your eyes and ears open.

In short you never see the slippery slope argument applied to changes that people think are good.

My failure to grasp the point you were making was that I choose to start from a neutral position. You should really try it sometime.  

I'm sure you've been pointed to places where decriminalising drugs and making dealing with drugs a public health rather than a criminal one has lead to a drop in the number of people taking drugs. Simply because you see a slope does not mean it's heading where you think it is or that how we currently deal with actually prevents people falling down it.

I think Cork's the only one who's proven he's good enough to be a squad player, Di Santo is decent, but Lukaku and Ba are clearly better than him, the same goes for Borini and Huth would be 5th choice right now. Cork's been consistently good at Southampton this season. 

&gt;Well I hate to break it to you, that was never the biggest problem. We were okay at developing 12-16 year olds. At that point we had just as good coaching as other top sides and just as good exposure to top football.

That was the problem though the youth was nowhere near as good as it is nor were the training facilities or the coaches, Abramovich has changed all this. We never developed players as well as Chalobah, McEachran, Kane, Baker and Loftus Cheek all in one year. John Terry was a complete fluke, who showed obvious potential and came from another academy.

&gt;It's not a step up from the Championship and won't prepare the players in any way that they wouldn't have with us.

The eredivisie is a clear step up from the Championship and the benefit of the loans is that the player gets regular playing time at a high level, they would not get this match experience if they stayed at Chelsea and their development would be stunted.

&gt;Our players should not have to get by on personal connections but rather a Clubs connections. We are in dire need of a proper plan at the top of the Youth Academy. There is no doubt that there has been much investment but Abramovic has got to learn (Torres an example of him not having learnt yet) that Money can't buy you everything. We need actual people in charge. This is why the Pep to Chelsea thing gave me so much hope, I don't think he's a great manager but the reorganisation of our youth structure beyond pretty objects to a team mentality is really needed. What Piet de Visser and Arnesen did is beyond me, all they did was sign some youth like everybody else and build a pretty building.

I don't see how getting by on club connections is any better than getting by on personal connections, at any rate it's clear that some players are loaned to other clubs strictly on merit. Todd Kane to Blackburn, Courtois was loaned to Atletico, Piazon to Malaga, McEachran to Middlesbrough, Omeruo to ADO Den Haag and so many other loans have been enacted purely due to the quality of the player, the Vitesse loans were also due to the quality of the player, you couldn't possibly argue that Van Aanholt, Kalas and Kakuta didn't improve the side. 

Furthermore, [Torres was an Ancelotti buy.](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4750100/Ray-Wilkins-Chelsea-boss-dilemma-due-to-Roman-Abramovich.html) 

What exactly do you think needs to be reorganised in the youth system? Where do you think de Visser and Arnesen failed? 

&gt;If it was so great now, many more of our youth players would be making the jump to senior England sides. The only player remotely close is Chalobah and he'll have to wait for the retirements as he probably won't be ahead of Rodwell for a while but he is 18 so it's possible. If our Academy is so great why do we not see them being touted for an England shirt.

I'm sorry, but this just demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how an academy actually works. The effects of investment and improvement won't be immediate due to the nature of an academy. We should soon be seeing the changes of the improved academy and we already are, Nathaniel Chalobah, Todd Kane, Josh McEachran, Sam Walker and Billy Clifford have all performed consistently well in the football league, the academy has succeeded in its objective to produce players good enough to make it at the professional level, no top tier academy will have all of its products playing for them, look at United recently the only players to have made the breakthrough are Evans, Welbeck and Cleverley, all of whom were loaned I might add. Chalobah, McEachran and Kane all have the potential to play for Chelsea and are have all had great seasons. I don't understand what you expect from the academy. 

&gt;Now to the argument that, oh well, at least they're getting game time. Well unfortunately, game time in a relatively uncompetitive league pretty much surmounts to playing as the first team against the U16. Most of the time it's going to be easy. So what? They should put all their energy into improving and doing the best for their team. Training hard and building strength. Ok, now there are 2 aspects to this. Firstly, many of the clubs we send our players to do not have facilities any where near the standard of ours, I've often looked at lower division teams training grounds in wonderment at how similar they are to my local conference teams. This goes for the staff too, would I rather have the Chelsea staff telling me where I need to add muscle mass or some less qualified staff. 

I agree that playing in a non competitive league doesn't amount to much, but the players are all loaned to clubs that play at a standard which they do find competitive, that's the entire point of the loan. Yes, the facilities at most of the clubs we send the players to will not be as good as ours, but the match experience is invaluable and the standard of training is still at a high level, especially as the players are still in contact with Chelsea trainers and told what they need to work on. 

&gt;The second aspect is a mental one, if you've spent the last 3 seasons training at Chelsea, grinding it out for the youth team and then you go to a foreign league where you don't really have anyone to look up to or have anything to drive towards then that motivation is lost somewhat. 

If you're a footballer and unable to motivate yourself then you most likely won't make it at Chelsea even with all the talent in the world. However, I don't understand why a player would be unmotivated simply because they've moved to a different league. There are still coaches, managers and experienced players. 

&gt; It takes a special sort of player to go abroad and improve drastically to the tune of what Chelsea management clearly think should happen and mentally many youth players lack this unsurprisingly and mostly without blame.

Yet, so many players regularly are loaned abroad and many clubs even the other top 5 ones whose youth systems you've praised so highly have done this and still do this. By your logic wouldn't the same effect be produced from buying any young player from a foreign league? 

&gt;Many of our players are already being cast off, if Kane and Kalas come back with great development that is wonderful.

If? They've clearly developed and benefited from the loan, have you not seen them play?

&gt;However, every time they go abroad, the scouts continue looking. We continue thinking about buying another right back (oh hai there Wallace) or who ever in their position who we think has more potential.

Of course the scouts continue to scout and buy new players, that is literally their job. Buying a young player now and developing them is low risk and high reward, if they turn out to be good enough for us, that's brilliant. If not then we can sell them for a lot more than we bought them for as they're no longer prospects. Besides, Wallace was acquired when we sold Deco to Fluminese, [in the deal we acquired 50% of his rights.](http://globoesporte.globo.com/es/noticia/2011/07/capixaba-ronan-troca-o-fluminense-pelo-chelsea.html)

&gt;And they may come straight into the team because the new manager knows who they are and how they play.

The manager looks at all of the players by pre season and will also take under consideration the advice of the scouts and the football director. 

&gt;Then eventually we decide to give up, or we don't and they go the way of PvA who is unlikely to feature as part of the Holland squad in the near future and nearly too old to be in the U21 squad (he is 22) thus he will pretty much be forgotten about internationally as Büttner catches and overtakes him now. 

Van Aanholt will be overtaking Buttner if anythings, as Butner's 2 years older. I don't really get what you're saying by this and why his inclusion in the Holland squad is relevant. 

&gt;So no, Kane and Kalas may not be sold right now. But they're not likely to play for us any time soon and it's best for them to be sold. Like Matic, allowing them to work as hard as possible, build new loyalties and a better career they deserve from the failings of our Directors.

Kane and Kalas have the potential to play at Chelsea, it's by no means a certainity they will given their age, but I think it's rather foolish to dismiss them, especially when you haven't even seen Wallace play or taken into account how valuable Kane is to us as a club trained player. I don't see why it's best for them to be sold, they clearly have the potential to play here and have been improving so much due to us. I also don't see how Matic is relevant.

The other way of looking at it is of a company making £100 million profit and wondering what to do with it. They could take it as profit, or spend half investing. They (should) pay around £20 million in tax if they take it all as profit, but if they invest half and take the rest as profit (purely hypothetical here, my rates are way off, just an example), then that is £50 going into the economy, paying wages, buying stuff from construction firms, all of which drives the economy forward and increases GDP through the multiplier effect.

Hence, by sacrificing £20 mill in tax, they get much more back from growth and other people paying tax.

Either you can do this publically via higher taxation (note, you are still being charged twice), or where the service is delivered by a private operator you can incentivise investment via tax relief. The net effect is equivalent. Note that investment has been considerably higher under private ownership than under public ownership, which is reflected by improvements in headline figures on service disruption and leaks. Of the two options I would rather pay a 'robber baron' who gave me a better service than a government that gave me a worse one.

Thing is, we aren't City, Utd, or Chelsea money or depth. If we sell any of these guys we wouldn't be replacing them with a sure thing. We'd be replacing them with someone we scouted who could come good or who could turn out to be nothing.

Who do we replace Reina with? All I've heard so far are some decent but unproven guys.

Certainly there are DMs we could get who look the part, but are we certain Wanyama would come or even be at Lucas' level? The idea of selling Agger is just ridiculous when we have no stability at the CB position.

Teams like Chelsea, Utd, and City can afford to let go of their experienced players because there are experienced ones right behind them or better options in the transfer market.

I understand the missing Modric and Van Der Vaart part as it does affect the service he gets, but the guy looks like a nun in a strip club half the time and its not good enough. Why should we 'hope' he turns up? I'd rather have a player that doesn't need transfer/money incentives to give effort. 

5 games at the end of the season is not what we need, especially as we are struggling to break the top 4, we need everyone pulling together and applying themselves to the best of their ability.

In 25 Prem games he scored 5 fucking goals. I couldn't care less what he did 2/3 seasons ago, it means nothing right now. All it does is add to the incredible frustration of watching him play at the moment. 

We all need to stop looking at what he 'can' do and start looking at how often he actually does it. For me, its no where near enough and i'd rather us look at new/youth options.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","I don't see why a dual carriageway can't prepare you for motorway driving - learning how to join the A3 at rush hour left me with enough skill and understanding to cope with the M25 around Heathrow at rush hour (was 4 lanes then, is 6 now).

Plus, it only takes one experience to realise that your skills aren't up to coping with a busy motorway; you can then hunt down a driving instructor and book lessons to improve your abilities, and compromise in the meantime by avoiding the motorway.

Further, I object very strongly to the idea that it's the test that's broken; the drivers I know who can't cope on the motorway are all at least a decade older than I am, and took their test at least 25 years ago. I do know drivers younger than me, who took their test ten years after I did, and they cope fine on the motorway, with correct lane discipline etc. 

Unless you introduce compulsory retesting (an idea I'm not opposed to in principle), you're not going to fix the problem of drivers not knowing things they should know by making the test even harder.

Note, too, that right now, it's irrational to spend money on driving lessons after you've passed - your chances of being prosecuted for bad driving are minimal if you don't speed or skip red lights (the two current fixed penalty notice offences), so the cost to you of being ignorant of proper driving is minimal. FPNs for careless driving have a chance of changing that analysis, and making it rational to ensure that your driving is of a high enough standard that you should win any attempt you make to challenge FPNs.",0,1370881712,null,0,false,0,cafy72k,t3_1g1nld,t1_cafy72k,t1_cafxgem,null,1430860882,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"The anger towards middle-lane hogs is misplaced. There can be very valid reasons for hogging the middle lane:

1. weaving - this is where a motorway exit is soon followed by a motorway entrance - basically the M4 between J1 and J8/9. You have fast moving cars diving into the slow lane to leave, and fast moving cars zooming up the slip road onto the motorway and then diving across two lanes into the fast lane - you don't want to be in that left-hand lane if you're not intending to use the slip road - and it makes sense to sometimes stay in the middle
2. 70mph - you're not legally allowed to go faster than this - so anybody complaining of someone doing 70mph in the middle lane is full of hypocrisy. If you're doing 70mph and cannot legally go faster - then there should be no problem staying in this lane - and cruising past those going slower in the left-hand lane.

There are *much* bigger problems on the motorways:

1. tailgating - fuck these people. I will shoot a fucking tailgater in the head if I had the fucking chance
2. speeders - when the limit is 70mph then doing 90+ is just selfish and stupid
3. divers - swinging from the fast lane into the slip road 5 yards from the exit is dangerous and selfish
4. changing lanes without indicating - I'm supposed to fucking guess what your intentions are? Fuck you.

I've yet to see police pull *anyone* over for *any* of this incredibly anti-social and dangerous behaviour.

&gt; I seem to be on the outside, as I find him to be actually on the cutting edge of criticism and social thought.

Read this again. This is what you wrote. Do you not think it drips with elitism? That's what I can't stand about a fair few Stewart Lee fans(and I *am* a Stewart Lee fan). If you look up any Lee video on youtube there'll be a load of ""Oh, you're just too stupid to understand him"" replies to anyone who says they don't like it.

The guy has had a 20 year stand up career, packs out theatres up and down the land, has had 2 succesful series on BBC2 with an extra 2 already commisioned. What makes you think you are on ""the outside""?

&gt; Also, picking out some of the more austere segments of his comedy and listing them as reasons why only self-important adolescent liberals (yank detected) would find him amusing is precisely the sort of dull attitude expected of a snide cunt.

I watched his TV series, there was a bit about Chris Moyles being thick, a bit about the British public being silly for choosing something as the funniest thing ever, a bit about people that live in the country not liking the country, a bit about Russell Howard making lots of money, a bit about David Cameron being posh. It was funny but very easy targets with his audience.

Some of his stand up is quite ""cutting edge"" like the amazing ""Vomiting into the gaping anus of Christ routine"" but a lot more of it is just a slightly cleverer version of the stuff you'd see on Have I Got News For You. There's nothing wrong with that but don't try and pretend it's anything more.

Also during your furious angry typing to explain what a snide cunt I am you've misquoted me and taken me out of context. I didn't say ""only"" middle class liberals like Stewart Lee I said they think they're special for being the only ones to get him(which isn't true).

Also you brought adolescents into it which makes me suspect you're an angsty post-16 with a chip on their shoulder.

Edit: Also what was that whole ""Yank detected"" bullshit about.

In all fairness to Mr. Smith, his height does not mean that we will be playing hoofball. It could be a major asset if McDermott makes wingers the focus of his team, as they could ideally be getting to the byline and teeing the ball up for Smith to (edit: cliche time!) leap like a salmon above the despairing defence and power the ball into the back of the net.

Of course, there is also the possibility that he will be a squad player and we'll only bring him on when we're 1-0 down and chasing the game, so we go 4-2-4 and start hoofing it up to him.

The good side for Ade is great, and the high moment of the year was him floating one into the top corner on Cech, but his lows are too predictable and frequent. In the penalty kick loss to Basel, I told everyone in the room during extra time that Ade would miss his penalty kick if it came down to it; not get blocked, but flat out miss. I'm sure a lot of you called it as well, and thats exactly what happened. 

Also, Defoe and Ade up top together was flat out awful. It wasn't an ideal formation and AVB knew it, but either way.

&gt;We proceeded directly to London, and took lodgings at the Adelaide Hotel. The supper seemed to me less luxurious than those I had seen in American hotels; but my situation was indescribably more pleasant. For the first time in my life I was in a place where I was treated according to my deportment, without reference to my complexion. I felt as if a great millstone had been lifted from my breast. Ensconced in a pleasant room, with my dear little charge, I laid my head on my pillow, for the first time, with the delightful consciousness of pure, unadulterated freedom.

...

&gt;I remained abroad ten months, which was much longer than I had anticipated. During all that time, I never saw the slightest symptom of prejudice against color. Indeed, I entirely forgot it, till the time came for us to return to America.

New games get rotated in each month (not sure how long they stay for) and so long as you've added them to your account you don't lose access to them once they get rotated out.


One final thing, if your subscription lapse then you'll lose access to those games but you get everything back when you renew, it's not gone forever.


It being the start of June they've announced what games are being removed and what they're being replaced with which is handy as I can show you what kind of stuff you'll see.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I am neutral. I just think it is possible that the government might be right when everyone here is wrong.

I'll get to the rest in a second but I just want to state that I never said the drug policy is wrong. I think the government is wrong for not reviewing it in something like a commission and my currently feeling is that such a review would show that more liberal laws could lead to less harm over all but if they didn't? If they could show me the the evidence that makes a compelling case for how the laws currently are? I'd be willing to change my mind. 

Just because I hold a personal view that is counter to someone else and I make attempts to justify and argue that view doesn't mean that I think I have to be right and I don't think any reasonable person here would.

&gt;Honestly? I don't give a shit.

You clearly do, and that's ok, that's good even. I've learnt something new today from you and while I disagree with what you say I'm glad you are saying it because nothing scares me more than my opinions being formed in a echo chamber. 

&gt;There are really, really good reasons to legalise drugs. There are really, really good reasons not to. Both lead to death. Both hurt the poor. Both ruin lives. Both have solid bodies of evidence to back them up. There are good reasons to support both.

In the end life leads to death and rest of that sentence could be used to describe economic policy depending on your point of view. Personally it seems like a no brainer that if we start by treating drugs as a public health issue rather than a criminal one will hurt people less and I want the more informed people in the world to have an open and honest debate about that because if it seems so obvious we are either missing some huge points or things need to change.

And in the end one way of doing things will be more harmful than the other and I want to be sure we are doing the right thing. 

&gt;But no. Because Richard Branson and a doctor think its a good idea, accompanied by a bastardised version of what has happened in Portugal, everyone who supports decriminalisation is right and everyone else is wrong.

I'm sorry but this bullshit, the piece is about Branson speaking out but it's utterly ridiculous to suggest that this is why people are arguing in favour of legalisation.   

&gt;Because of the keyboard warriors on this subreddit who know better than the thousands of people employed by the government to do this for a living.

The government is not infallible and utter, fundamental, underpinning of the whole system is an informed public engaging in an informed debate. You can either try to add to that debate or you can pretend like these people opinions don't matter when they each matter exactly as much as yours.

&gt;I said what I said to stop the circlejerk of everyone thinking everyone wanted decriminalisation. They don't.

You know who did that more effectively? The guy who went and got the polling data.

&gt;The people who decide this know more than us, and all of the anti-government positions are just asserting the government are idiots who don't know what they are doing.

I'll point you back to the government economic policy and how our chancellor stood up and lorded the results of a paper that has a very basic excel spreadsheet error to thank for it's results. The idea that the government simply knows best is, to put it mildly, fucking ridiculous. Again this is not to say they are wrong but it's not to say they are right either.

&gt;They do. It is just possible that they want to ignore you, because the pro-drug movement, like the anti-European movement, will never be satisfied until they get what they want.

What I want is evidence based policy making on drug laws. How awful.

&gt;There are things that people on reddit are clueless about. People who are ignorant, but think they are informed and than the people who are informed are idiots for disagreeing with them.

Yes there are and I full expect informed people to correct them and to do so regardless of if they change people minds because if some one is simply set in their path then it's people who might read the debate that matter and if you think you are right and can prove it then you maybe able to prove it to those some come after. 

&gt;Usually, this subreddit is open minded. Today, well, I have been reminded there are certain areas where they are not. I get downvotes for contributing, others state untrue facts which are then disproved, but as they support decriminalisation, they get upvotes.

People who down vote what they disagree with are idiots, I've only down voted you once in our debate and that's because it was an awfully written post. If you can prove something is untrue do it. Again I'll point you to the guy who went and go the polling data. 

To be brutally honestly I think you've got a overly high opinion of your views and your ability to argue them and you are seeming getting upset that you've not been able to change peoples minds. But fuck me, what do I know as I'm pretty sure I'm far more often than not guilty of the same stupid shit. I just hope that I'm open to the idea that I might not be so much better than everyone else than I can sometimes think.

If you walk into a mobile phone shop you can pick up a cheap handset for a few quid. http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/pay-as-you-go/samsung-e1230-payg/ is £5 when you buy £20 of credit (so £25 in total ~CA$39), and if my reading of that is correct it would get you 1GB data, 400 texts and 100 minutes - so better value than using your own plan. That's the first one I came across, there are almost certainly better deals, depending very much on your usage profile (if you will be calling home a lot, you might want to look at one of the speciality operators who market to such people, such as lycamobile)

You will be able to get such a phone in under half an hour easily, I think I have seen them in airport vending machines to be honest

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"This will be interesting, i think every single one of us has a top 10 (or 20, or 30) list of strikers.

For me i think it could almost split the list into 2 lists, Top 10 over 25 and top 10 under 25.  I am of the opinion that no matter what we need to grab 2 strikers in this window and i think a pairing of an established player and a young buck would be best.

1. **Mario Gomez** - Ok, i know this one is a pipe dream, i know we can never afford him or his wages.  But he is exactly the type of striker we need. He can score with his shot, he is good in the air, he has good touch on passing and has some creativity.  I chalk Gomez up as a fantasy but still think he should be the #1 on the list until someone (Napoli) else pays the fortune to land him.

2. **Pierre Ermerick Aubameyang** - I think this guy would be great for us. Good pace, good size, good passing, creative, can work on the wing if need be, has a bit of flair. Positioning is solid but could be improved.  He is young and would be reasonably priced (they are saying £10m-£13m), good candidate to lead the line for a few years.

3. **Roberto Soldado** - All he ever seems to do is score, has good creativity, he can hold up the ball, he isn't even a big guy but is good in the air, has great positioning. His price tag bothers me (i've seen £20m) but would be a big add to our team.

4. **Christian Benteke** - I hate the price tags being thrown around for him (£20m - £25m) since it seems like we would be paying a ""hype tax"", that said i think the kid is good and would fit well with the team. Big, physical with good touch i think he would bring to us what Ade had before his form went to shit. He is young and could lead the line for several years.

5. **Jackson Martinez** - Another player who i just hate the price tag (£20m - £30m) of but love the talent.  Seems to have a good shot, good creativity, can pass, solid size and pace.  A full package player, but that price tag...that price tag.

6.**David Villa** - I think this would be a fantastic signing for us, and would really love to have Villa and any other striker.  Villa's pedigree is just massive and i think would go a long way to help show the youngsters on the team (of which we have many) what it takes to be a champion.  Add in he would be a massive upgrade to our current strikers even at the age of 31 and could be had for a reasonable price and this would be a huge signing for us.

7.**Leandro fucking Damiao** - I think like a number of people i am just tired of hearing his name as a ""possibility"", the whole ""will he or won't he play for Spurs"" drama is exhausting.  Then again, i think the kid has talent and alot of it. Seems to loaf it a bit from time to time but also has that ""Brazilian Magic"" that he pulls out now and then that makes you realize how massively scary talented he is, the idea of putting him with AVB and getting him to really refine his craft is wildly enticing despite his painful transfer history.

8.**Wilfred Bony** - I like this guy, probably not as much as /u/sickgrof but i think he would be a great pickup for us.  Pricing at the moment seems low (i've seen £10m - £12m), big power striker who can do some damage in the air and hit from in the box.  don't know that he is as creative at setting up chances as some of the others but seems like he can bury the chances he gets.

9.**Rodrigo** - the more i have seen of this kid the more i like him, he is young, has fantastic pace, good shot, solid positioning, is relatively cheap and oozes talent.  I wouldn't want him as a primary choice at striker but would be a good one to have if we landed a more established player.

10.**Matej Vydra** - This is a guy who produced for Watford, has a solid eye, good shot and good passing ability.  He's young but more developed than any of our youth strikers.  I think this is a kid who would be fantastic as a 3rd choice striker while he develops.  Put him behind a top quality striker and let him learn and i think he would be a good one for us down the line.

1) who the fuck knows what Hodgson will do so I can only speculate
2) who're England's wingers Sterling would be competing against?

Walcott, Ox, maybe Zaha depending on how well he does this season are the three I see as Sterling's biggest competition. Not to mention Downing and Wellbeck. Sturridge I guess might be deployed out wide too, but I'd like to see a 4-4-1-1 or 4-2-3-1 with Rooney behind Sturridge. 

Ashley Young, and Aaron Lennon really don't impress me much and IMO England would benefit more from younger wingers, have the experience come the the back, middle, and up top. 

Walcott and Downing have more experience and would probably be good choices for starters, but if Sterling has a great season for us I could see him reasonably being called up as an impact sub for the World Cup though there is quite a bit of competition for him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. hindsight's 20/20, but for a 5m fee and City subsidized wages, he was a decent stopgap option for the year.

2. Ade's undoubtedly better at integrating teammates into the attack, whereas Defoe is going to shoot at first glance at the goal. Ade muffed a ton of short-range goals, however--he was a striker who did most things pretty well except strike. 

3. it's some sort of psychological thing. I think the ""lazy"" knock he gets is a bit unfair. just because some players don't run around constantly doesn't mean they can't impact the game or don't care (Berbatov being the obvious example here). However, his body language/attitude were wildly inconsistent and didn't seem to reflect any sort of logic. He pouted when he didn't start under the AVB meritocracy, but in games where he could've ""won his spot"" he seemed detached. then when Defoe was hurt and limited to a super-sub role, Ade still seemed kind of turned off until a big game like the Chelsea one. so he's basically a psychological black box at this point--maybe it was injury and too much uncertainty over his role, or something we won't know, but there just seems to be something holding him back and no clear way to get rid of it. 

4. that's a low fee--I'd rather keep even a mediocre Ade as an impact sub or cup starter (rotation, etc) than collect a fee that wouldn't buy much of anything. There are also a bunch more players that could be sold to clear room in the wage bill and transfer market coffer (Huddlestone, Livermore, Defoe, etc). I'd only do it if there was some expensive star coming in with high wages and the only way to sign him was to dump Ade's contract. 

I guess he's like a 5/10? He's done so much damage against Spurs in the past I could never really get on board, but his honeymoon period last year (and celebration with Bale when they combined for a goal in any capacity) were fun as hell.

When it first started, Channel 4 received its revenue through local ITV companies (who would sell advertising space on behalf of Channel 4 - in the early days, the ITV companies couldn't sell enough of it, leaving people with slides telling them that the programme would restart shortly). Thus, it had the ultimate freedom to do what it wanted as a more adventurous arts channel and as a less stuffy version of BBC2. Hence, early Channel 4 is pretty batshit in terms of programming.

But when Channel 4 became its own corporation in 1993, it had to fend for itself. It had to become more populist, especially under Michael Grade, in order to balance the books. We got Friends and Father Ted, which are both very mainstream, but the amount of serious documentaries and more alternative stuff reduced significantly e.g. the absence of comedies like Absolutely. 

Now that advertising is less profitable than it used to be, what with a recession on, Channel 4 is starting to feel the pinch. It means there will be even less intellectual programming so that advertising space is more profitable to advertisers, and less money to buy/create intellectual programming for the sake of doing so, because of general lack of funds. Under the Ofcom remit, Channel 4 has to be innovative and experimental. The only way to do it these days is to stretch this remit to the absolute limit by airing programmes which mock the sections of society it would have originally treated seriously.

And thus, Big Fat Gypsy Weddings gets commissioned, we get cheap productions like Come Dine With Me, and the Daily Show is no longer shown on More4, a once serious channel which is now essentially Channel 4 Daytime all day.",0,1370894209,null,0,false,0,cag2zjy,t3_1g1gbj,t1_cag2zjy,t3_1g1gbj,null,1430858553,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Ok, it took totalitarian tactics to do it, but there wouldn't have been any other way.

 dont really rate him at all &amp; I'm surprised so many do. If we're looking at Eredivisie strikers I'd rather we talk about Finnbogason &amp; not only because he might bring the best out of Siggy (&amp; vice versa).

Wilfried Bony is just not that good a footballer. He's gotten goals, yes, but have you seen the ""high"" calibre of players also scoring lots of goals in Holland this season? It's getting ridiculous &amp; you've got to be SO careful buying from there.

I actually think Finnbogason is a MUCH better footballer than Bony, whose game is almost entirely about brute strength (he's not even that quick). He was terrible at the ACN &amp; to even talk about him in the same breath as Drogba is just silly. Finnbogason's range of finishing FAR exceeds Bony's and he has much more technique to his game too &amp; will be much more effective in other areas of the pitch. He's certainly much more of a Spurs ""type"" of player.

That said, I'm not convinced yet he would be a success either in England. I'm really wary of the Dutch League right now, beyond those players who are clearly gifted footballers

--------------------------------

ideally he would first play a year or two at a club like Fulham. I know he'll cost more when he's there, but right now, I don't think he's good enough for us.

--------------------------------------

Whenever I watch Bony he just looks clumsy. At the ACN he was poor and his ""goal"" was a joke - it was practically heading for a throw-in before it took a deflection. I just don't think he has the technique nor all-round game to improve enough to be a success at the top of the Premier League. i mention Finnbogason earlier, who isn't nearly ready to succeed at the top of the Premier League either, but his technique is MUCH better than Bony's and he has much more scope for improvement in the necessary areas. 

Things like bulking up and movement can be worked on in the gym &amp; training, touch, skill &amp; instinct cannot really be taught - you either have it or you don't. Bony already has the size and he is an opportunist but there's nothing I can see there in terms of potential

----------------------------------------------

Bony is lazy he walks about 200m a whole match. I doubt how he plays against a real defense.

-------------------------------------------------

I feel the same way every time I watch him play. He looks clumsy and a bit heavy. I didn't see the coordination in his footwork and technique that look like he could develop to the level that the PL would need him to in order to be successful. I think the level of defending where he is contributes a lot to his composure and success at the moment.

At his current playing level, I don't think he'll be good enough for the top 7 clubs.

-------------------------------------------------

I'm not that impressed with Bony, defending in the Dutch league is terrible. &lt;-- Very well researched fan.

----------------------------------------------------

If we were scouting Bony from Aston Villa I would be more up for it. I just don't think he's a special talent like Suarez and there were doubts about him, but it was clearly worth the risk. So considering that I would be more comfortable paying for a player we've seen perform in the PL. I just don't think if we're spending over £12m we shouldn't pass on the more sure thing in our situation. If we were in United's spot and we were just looking for another striker to put us in a very strong position, then yeah fine but we need this one to work.  &lt;-- Same researched fan.",0,1370898912,null,0,false,0,cag4ubs,t3_1g2571,t1_cag4ubs,t1_cag2wyw,null,1430857678,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Firstly, thanks for the reply. I know many people would have faced that wall of text and not considered what I have to say.

&gt;I think Cork's the only one who's proven he's good enough to be a squad player, Di Santo is decent, but Lukaku and Ba are clearly better than him, the same goes for Borini and Huth would be 5th choice right now. Cork's been consistently good at Southampton this season.

Perhaps the assertion was misleading but I was just trying to suggest that we only develop talent to a mediocre level. They're capable of taking on a squad role but hardly have the ability to lead a team like Chelsea. Which is ideally what you'd want, a driven and devoted spine that's been with the club for years. The suggestion being that I doubt many of today's crop of young talent will actually go on to be what we need them to be, key first team players that drive the team.

&gt;That was the problem though the youth was nowhere near as good as it is nor were the training facilities or the coaches, Abramovich has changed all this. We never developed players as well as Chalobah, McEachran, Kane, Baker and Loftus Cheek all in one year. John Terry was a complete fluke, who showed obvious potential and came from another academy.

I agree that the training facilites were no where near what they are now but the coaching is largely similar. Bath has been at the club since 1992 and Viveash hardly has a wealth of experience at training youth sides. However, having been a professional footballer he is obviously a welcome tutor to many guys but I still feel as though we should have more staff at Chelsea specialising in bringing the best out of the Youth teams. As for the current crop having more talent, I doubt that very much. Every year the newest additions or newest players in the fan's eye line will gain a title of star of the future. We must be realistic and acknowledge how unlikely that is to happen. Not that it couldn't but how much more work there is to do. You may be successful at a youth level, but you might be 18, other 18 year olds are already playing in the Premier League, not achieving titles or awards but playing and developing. This is where I feel we fail most as a Club, we cannot and have not regularly infused young players into the team. Currently we are overhauling our squad with lots of players under 25. Youth talent needs to be infused gently in to a squad to achieve the best results (sorry for making it sound like a desert but in a sense there is an art to it given that a manager must understand who's personality works with whom, who can tutor who, who is a good role model etc).

Equally, I wouldn't say Terry is a fluke, by that justification you could say that every great player ever is a fluke, but as such more of them appear at certain clubs than others etc. There are reasons for these correlations. Despite what you may believe, Chelsea's youth system, was not completely awful. It was by no means good. But it was capable of finding talented players, possibly to an equal capacity as now. It would fail some of them at younger ages as there would not be facilities available to all of them to work with coaches at appropriate times. Such as the Schoolboy coaching that currently takes place. We had the u18 Italian Captain in our youth system, he was good. And strangely went off the radar, heck we even played him more than if we had the same situation now. He said he wanted to go back to Italy and there he dissipated into insignificance. He could just have easily been a great player. Robert Huth was also a great youth player, with easily the same potential to do well as Terry.

Also, on the number of quality players produced within one crop, I wouldn't call it too soon. I'm glad that there are many English midfielders that are at Chelsea but whether any of them will actually develop beyond to reach the levels needed for the senior team is doubtful.

&gt;The eredivisie is a clear step up from the Championship and the benefit of the loans is that the player gets regular playing time at a high level, they would not get this match experience if they stayed at Chelsea and their development would be stunted.

Personally I disagree on this level. I don't think the Eredivisie is what it once was. It is in dire need of re-monetisation and could do with a greater following. On the question of Leagues. AVB, while with us, lobbied the FA for the establishing of secondary clubs in a similar way to the way reserve clubs are run in Germany and Spain. I ask you, where in our tiering system do you think these teams would be? Where would Manchester United's Reserve team be? What division? Bear in mind that Barcelona B/Castilla can play in the Spanish second tier whilst the German reserve sides can only play up to the German 3rd tier (It replaced their previous 3rd tier and moved their previous 3rd tier teams to a 4th tier).",0,1370899250,null,0,false,0,cag4z5e,t3_1fz6m1,t1_cag4z5e,t1_cafx0yy,null,1430857615,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt;I don't see how getting by on club connections is any better than getting by on personal connections, at any rate it's clear that some players are loaned to other clubs strictly on merit. Todd Kane to Blackburn, Courtois was loaned to Atletico, Piazon to Malaga, McEachran to Middlesbrough, Omeruo to ADO Den Haag and so many other loans have been enacted purely due to the quality of the player, the Vitesse loans were also due to the quality of the player, you couldn't possibly argue that Van Aanholt, Kalas and Kakuta didn't improve the side.

I believe ADO Den Haag is actually a club connection as it happens ([Source: (Was the quickest I could find, I believe we already had that outstanding agreement on the ADO Den Haag youth players from years ago sometime near 2010)](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-have-forged-a-partnership-deal-with-dutch-1675253) as are Vitória Guimarães in portugal where Lalkovič is currently on loan). As for the Athletico deal, that came about because they were the only other team to properly challenge us for the signing of Courtois, hence if they needed him for a first team place it made sense. Piazon to Malaga and McEachran to Middlesborough and Kane to Blackburn are examples of the club finding someone or those clubs getting in contact or agents or whatever. 

I would argue that Vitoria Guimaraes and Den Haag are not the best places to be sending youth on loan. Establishing proper links with a Championship or League 1 side could be beneficial for our 16-18 year olds (if 16yr olds can go on loan I'm not sure). The really beneficial loans have been for players who have signed for us with the future in mind but can't usurp our key players just yet so go on loan to be key players for another club. Awkwardly, many of these players could have been classed as home grown at club had they not been loaned. I admit in these cases that playing time at a quality club such as Courtois at Atheltico is undoubtably beneficial and a good decision even if it was largely Athletico's doing.

&gt;I'm sorry, but this just demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how an academy actually works. The effects of investment and improvement won't be immediate due to the nature of an academy. We should soon be seeing the changes of the improved academy and we already are, Nathaniel Chalobah, Todd Kane, Josh McEachran, Sam Walker and Billy Clifford have all performed consistently well in the football league, the academy has succeeded in its objective to produce players good enough to make it at the professional level, no top tier academy will have all of its products playing for them, look at United recently the only players to have made the breakthrough are Evans, Welbeck and Cleverley, all of whom were loaned I might add. Chalobah, McEachran and Kane all have the potential to play for Chelsea and are have all had great seasons. I don't understand what you expect from the academy.

I made that example primarily for the point of those saying that our Youth system is great now, look at the evidence of all the great players we have right now at the youth level. They are great youth level players. They are not great senior level players. They have great potential, as have many other previous Chelsea graduates. Performing well in the football league is not the same as performing well in the Premier league. Indeed you then went on to say that we are actually just seeing the benefits now. Well we're not just yet, unless you count the Next Gen series and the FA Youth Cup. My argument is that players are not stepping up well enough or regularly enough. Wilshere became a first team squad member immediately after winning the FA Youth Cup. Appearing in the Champions League, and PL as well as just turning 17 in the process.

On your note about Man U, those are the only players to recently break through but they're still 3 more players than we can manage. On the other hand, I wouldn't say that any of those players are breaking though to play more than a squad role. As we could well do but don't with some of our youngsters.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt;If you're a footballer and unable to motivate yourself then you most likely won't make it at Chelsea even with all the talent in the world. However, I don't understand why a player would be unmotivated simply because they've moved to a different league. There are still coaches, managers and experienced players.

Firstly, living in a different country is strange. Seriously, I'm doing it at the moment. You move to somewhere without any pre-existing friends and the general atmosphere is different. It can take a while to adjust, why do you think we often say that players who have just arrived in the PL will take a while to adjust. Why would it be any different for younger players to move to another league? Heck, wouldn't this be harder if your not even 20 yet and haven't had much experience of playing in Europe with or against other playing styles. Of course, many of our youth players abroad have come from abroad so should be able to adjust quicker than most but is this not the entire point. Indeed, there are managers and experienced players to help with motivation, but familiarity and understanding also help with motivation. You can't simply be motivated if you don't know what the boss is getting at. There are so many psychological factors involved with motivation that it can be daunting to even delve into it, hence it has quelled my motivation to do so. An example of an de-motivator in action. A simplified quick example might be that if you are going to a club where you know you're going to play every week do you start to lose your motivation to improve aspects of your game you'd be asked to if you were back in the Prem. Particularly physicality. 

&gt;Yet, so many players regularly are loaned abroad and many clubs even the other top 5 ones whose youth systems you've praised so highly have done this and still do this. By your logic wouldn't the same effect be produced from buying any young player from a foreign league?

Actually many of them do not loan abroad. All the examples you listed from Man U were loaned to English Clubs aside from Evans who incidentally has show the least growth towards the promise he'd previously shown. Some clubs may loan a player back to a team from their country of origin but I'm lacking any specific examples here. Largely, ""home-grown"" at club talents are loaned in and around the top 2 divisions, occasionally to League 1 if it's a really young player who may benefit. The real measure is how many English national team members are from your club (unless of course you've done a Jones which I shall explain in the following paragraph). Essentially you will want your club to have as many of your players as possible in the national team (Senior, U21, U18 etc) this is because it shows that your players have a better general ability than anyone else at that moment in that position. Again this is arbitrary and a measurement of ability again. Particularly as those with true exceptional ability are often fast-tracked as it were through the U21 and U18 straight to a rotation position in the senior team particularly for friendlies. By this barometer you can see that Arsenal and Man U do consistently well. Chelsea are improving but tend to lack depth. I.e. we will have a few good prospects in Midfield but none in defence or attack. Anyway, this also shows the ability of academies such as Aston Villa, Southampton, Everton and relatively recently Tottenham with quite a lot of young players with potential. What we need to do usurp one or more of them for English talent rather than doing a Jones.

Doing a Jones, is buying a player at 18 with the intention of registering them in your squad for the next 3 seasons and letting them develop playing fairly regularly for your team. Over the next 3 seasons he will gain home grown at club status whilst you have bought a nearly complete article at 18 with all the benefits of a home grown player.

EDIT: Should also note that you can do a Jones with individuals from different countries, eg we can buy Lukaku at 18 and do it. Ideally we should have done that but I can't expect Emenalo to do that when he has to take care of  Zorres.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt;If? They've clearly developed and benefited from the loan, have you not seen them play?

I haven't seen much and I doubt Mou will have until recently. So you think they'll make the squad this season then?

&gt;Of course the scouts continue to scout and buy new players, that is literally their job. Buying a young player now and developing them is low risk and high reward, if they turn out to be good enough for us, that's brilliant. If not then we can sell them for a lot more than we bought them for as they're no longer prospects. Besides, Wallace was acquired when we sold Deco to Fluminese, in the deal we acquired 50% of his rights.

I was not aware of the 50% rights thing. Thanks. I thought we weren't allowed partial ownership though or is that just to be registered in the Premier League? Probably just the FA. Good rule IMO though. Anyway, I digress. The point was that the longer you spend away (abroad not on loan in the same league) the harder and harder it will be to come back because you simply won't be in everyone's thoughts. 

&gt;The manager looks at all of the players by pre season and will also take under consideration the advice of the scouts and the football director.

Indeed but what I was trying to explain is that if you've got a player who you know is coming in during the transfer window whilst you're sorting out deals whilst everyone is on holiday you're more likely to look up stuff on him than players who are already at the club. Equally, the pre-season assessment does do that, but the changing the Manager part way thought the season somewhat wrecks that plan doesn't it. The new person coming in has to learn about the youth and what they're like each time. Indeed, Mou spoke about this very issue in his press conference saying that stability is important for the youth players/younger players and their development.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt;Van Aanholt will be overtaking Buttner if anythings, as Butner's 2 years older. I don't really get what you're saying by this and why his inclusion in the Holland squad is relevant.

His inclusion in the Holland squad is relevant for the same reason we have the saying ""world-class"" meaning that that individual is the best in an entire country at something. If PvA isn't in his national team anymore he isn't really ""world-class"" and we would be better served by giving a rotation position for a younger guy with the potential to be better, rather than someone who appears to be stagnating more or less. 

&gt;Kane and Kalas have the potential to play at Chelsea, it's by no means a certainity they will given their age, but I think it's rather foolish to dismiss them, especially when you haven't even seen Wallace play or taken into account how valuable Kane is to us as a club trained player. I don't see why it's best for them to be sold, they clearly have the potential to play here and have been improving so much due to us. I also don't see how Matic is relevant.

Kane and Kalas will likely be given till their 21 and then be reassessed. But with the way football is agist towards development they will probably have already been written off as having the potential to be a ""useful member"" of the squad rather than someone who is bound to develop further and become a leading star.

Don't get me wrong, I'd happily eat my words for a home grown leader as a key player at Chelsea but I will not be blindingly optimistic about potentials. 





Now I'm tired, because this is a discussion between 2 people who do not stick to their points particularly well or make them very succinct ahaha. I'll proof-read this again in the morning at some point.

EDIT: I've been writing this on and off for more or less the past 3 and a half hours. This is rather annoying as I feel as though I've missed some of your points. Anyway, on the Torres deal. I read somewhere, I'm sorry but finding the source is unlikely. I believe it was a Chelsea affiliated blog but don't hold me to that. Anyway, it basically detailed Chelsea's pursuit of Torres over the years. We had made several bids. Steadily rising from £20 million to £35 million got rejected by Athletico. Then when they did eventually sell him they sold him for less money than what we offered. Torres also went to Liverpool on a worse contract than what we offered. The following bid from Abramovich that ended in the £30 million offer jumping to £50 was symptomatic of Abramovich finally getting his man. 

There is no doubt in my mind (whether Ancelotti wanted him or not) that it was Abramovich who forced it through, probably because he wanted to prove to himself that he could get whatever he wanted with his money. (Wouldn't you be the same if you had that much money, you can say no, but what you really mean is I want that much money ahaha).

Also Wilkins does seem to say a lot of things in rage. He was attacking Neymar recently and I was more or less with him until he said he just hasn't got any pace. He's not quick enough to take it round people at the highest level. Then he promptly out sprinted our defence multiple times.

It would very likely be treated in the same way we treat alcohol or tobacco duty: it would keep going up and up every time a government needs to fill a deficit in the budget. On top of that, the government would still publish dozens of leaflets warning of the dangers, and people who can't afford it will stop using it, as is the case with people unable to afford alcohol or tobacco.

I imagine that marijuana would become somewhat of a luxury because of all this taxation that will be piled onto the base price, and would subsequently be treated in the same way as cigars.

And this is why I'm ultimately sceptical about any significant relaxing of drug laws: the only people I can see who will benefit are middle-class kids who will be able to afford it but are otherwise too afraid of getting a criminal record. In my opinion, only bad criminals get caught.

The poor, on the other hand, will resort to another cheap drug to sustain an otherwise non-existent economy, cut with all sorts of non-identifiable rubbish, and probably more highly dangerous than smoking a joint.

You say 'Now go and accidentally and unknowingly break some more rules so the cycle can continue', which is a fair and valid point. Are you saying that these rules should be made obvious to people? Surely that then goes back to my original point of a reform of the test? Is there a better solution to this issue?

I'm not normally for penalty points/fines for things that have essentially no victims, but I've seen too many people crash their cars and know too many people who have died in car crashes - it's clearly obvious that driving is dangerous not only for the person driving but other road users - it just seems to me that the safest option, irrelevant of other details, is to thoroughly explain motorway driving and have the driver prove they are capable of it before they drive on them.

If you can make money, and by extension make other people money, they don't care who you are or where you are from.

I think there is a difference between actual racism (hatred of or discrimination against other races) and stereotyping/generalising (Irish love a drink, French are arrogant, Germans efficient, Americans loud, Australians mad...). The problem is to generalise and joke and say something like ""Indians are all X"" can obviously be easily seen as racist, but to say ""the Irish are all drunks"" is generally taken as a worn out cliche. British people have a pretty dry, sarcastic sense of humour so that is also hard to read - but it means you do hear jokes that in another context would be racist... but it's poking fun at racism because they are creating what will be the cliche in 50 years.

&gt;there's no such thing as canon

These two phrases do not make sense together. ""No canon"" does not mean that it has an all-inclusive canon where everything counts, from the TV show to audios to novels. It means quite the opposite, in fact. No canon means that *nothing* counts, at all, unless it's actively part of a running plot thread or has been mentioned within the timespan of the current plot thread.

If a novel says the Doctor once visited the death of Rose Tyler's father, then within that novel, that event happened. That doesn't mean that it has happened/will happen in the timeline of every single novel, audio, comic, and TV season. If one of those things decides that the Reapers' existence is a detriment to the story, then it will simply refuse to acknowledge them. See: The act of touching a past version of yourself in A Christmas Carol vs. Father's Day.

You have two options - you can either buy two Advance singles (if they cost less than the cost of a return in total obviously) or a return. Look underneath the prices next to your train time options - this will tell you if the fares are 'Advance', 'Anytime' or 'Offpeak'. 


If you buy an Advance ticket - then you are constrained to only getting the train you have booked the ticket for - so in my opinion this is only worth doing if it is significantly cheaper than the other fares. It is only the advance tickets that increase in price until the date of departure - the others remain constant. 


On a Saturday you probably won't need an Anytime ticket (these tend to be only for peak hours, which tend to be weekdays only, but double check) - so look for the Offpeak option.

You can buy tickets on the day - ticket offices tend to have long queues though so best to know in advance what ticket you would like to buy and use the ticket machines. Generally, all you need to know is whether you want Off peak or Anytime, and sometimes a general idea of route (although if you are already starting from london, this probably won't apply - sometimes trains are more expensive if they go via London).

He's a CAM who scores a lot of headers, which probably fits nicely with the idea of getting balls into the box from out wide - he's certainly a greater threat than Wes!

Also, he can cover LW, which is handy in case no other cover comes in. Also gives us the option to play him and Wes against weaker teams, or on narrow pitches, as both can cover the same areas, giving both more freedom. 

My only concern would be how creative he is. Wes is very valuable to us when on form, and I wouldn't want to lose his guile and creativity from the starting side to bring in a taller player to effectively act as a second striker. However, if this guys got some decent vision too, I'd be very happy.

This gives you a further 6 months on a fiance visa in which to organise the marriage, plus avoids the requirement for evidence of two years living together. Its clearly a genuine relationship, so it would be a legitimate step to take.

My understanding has always been that the post study work visa is incredibly difficult to extend.

EDIT: Also, if you could persuade her employer to continue her employment she WOULD be able to temporarily leave the country to avoid a substantial overstay without impeding the visa process. As long as you can continue to prove evidence you are still together and living in a relationship similar to that of a spouse you can have periods apart of up to 6 months, which you would have (bills, phone calls etc).

If the Picts had left messages written in Ogham wouldn't we know at least *something* about their language? All we appear to have is some names of kings, placenames of a sort, and some inscriptions that some people *claim* are Ogham, but that is pretty speculative.

They work in a number of ways, but for our purposes we'll go with two, the basic division in design, which is subtracive, or additive. The first way is subtractive, taking a small drill or something similar and cutting away from an object, usually some sort of sponge or ceramic. It's not nearly as popular, or efficient, instead, people typically use something additive. This printer is an additive one. The cheapest one you're going to find currently, and most likely for quite some time, is about $500. How it works is it uses three motors to move a head with heated plastic along the three axes of space. By doing so, it slowly ""prints"" an object into 3D, by which I mean it creates a small plastic object. If you actually have a USE for creating your own objects, and a background in CAD, or graphic design, you'd get a ton of use out of a 3D printer. If you don't, then you still might get some use out of it, if you go to thingiverse, or something like it, to get other people's models and make your own things.

true,mightyneonfraa,null,null,"What a dumb article. The author completely missed out on the very obvious idea that the Doctor is not a series of characters but all the same character who has grown and developed over the years, even before it was intentional.

Looking at the Doctor's first few incarnations it's easy to imagine him as being very young. The First Doctor didn't want to fly off to save the universe, he just didn't want to be stuck following the rules put in place by some stodgy old men. He wanted to explore and have fun, the most accurate part of the article was when it was talking about how Four just wanted to go on holiday.

But he changed as time went on. He grew up. All those years seeing the universe and saving worlds and he began to care about it. His travels became more than just a way to have a good time. He grew and changed and became a hero.

And then the Time War happened and everything changed. The Doctor went to war and he was forced to see and do terrible things, to make impossible decisions and sacrifice lives just for the hope that someday something good would come out of it. In the end he lost everything. His home, his family, his past. Everything.

Now all he has left is the universe that he came to care for as a young man and that he sacrificed everything to preserve. The Doctor now is an old man, a veteran of a war of a scale that we still can't fully grasp, he's no longer that young Time Lord who ran off just looking to enjoy himself.

Bringing the Doctor back to who he was at the very beginning would just throw all of that away. The darkness of the character isn't gone, if anything it's deeper than ever, it's just hidden behind that quirkiness that's there to protect the Doctor as much as it is to protect those around him.

How does it come off to the other players who were short of playing time last year to hear this kid say his contributions were wasted &amp; he didn't have anything to do with the trophies?

""I'm not afraid of competition,"" said Lukaku. ""I think I can play at Chelsea like at West Bromwich. Many games. I am also realistic: if I can not break through at Chelsea I deserve not to go to the World Cup.""

Here's my favorite Romelu quote when he was on a sports talk show in Belgium during the past season..
""With talent you can get far, but with working hard you get farther."" He said he learned a fair amount from training and seeing how hard players like Lampard train, but there's only so much a younger player can accomplish by practicing and not improving his skills in actual matches.  

AVB wasn't aware that if he played Romelu vs. Norwich he wouldn't be allowed to be loaned (because he had played for Anderlecht before we bought him). Rules wouldn't allow him to be loaned and AVB didn't realize that. There's no way he could have gotten in front of Drogba, Torres, Sturridge, and Anelka as an 18 year old.

In case we forgot, he was the top scorer in the Jupiler League as a 16 year old. So I completely understand his frustration of not playing for almost a year.  

I understand your worries though, but after the year he had, I think he's forgotten about his personal wasted year and is now looking forward to the opportunity at hand.

lampard is still a good player but is too limited in terms of spreading play, in reality he is a forward playing in midfield because he has excellent touch and creative ability but thinks too much in vertical lines. 

chelsea hasnt had a truely intergrated midfield since jose mourinho took charge. and even then it wasnt amazing, ballack was never amazing at chelsea outside a couple of games where lampard was injured and he could play his natural game. we have never replaced makalele as a player and mikel although excellent technically doesnt have the robustness and drive needed for the role. 
tiago was the last midifelder that we had that could actually spread play and control tempo.

chelsea hasnt been a coherent team in a long time, under ancelotti for a few games everything clicked but that was purely down the left side where it was unstoppable. in midfield it has always been shit. 

chelsea still have a noveau riche need to sign big name players and refuse to give players not signed on massive fees a proper chance. ",0,1370939796,null,0,false,0,caghzb4,t3_1g3v1v,t1_caghzb4,t3_1g3v1v,null,1430851342,31,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,31

We need a Cavani, we don't need a Hulk. I haven't seen much support for an expensive Hulk buy. If Hulk came, he would be useful, but expensive. Many if not most people on this subreddit would rather we spend the money elsewhere on a DM but equally, they're not against what they feel is improving the squad. Improving the squad is paramount and IMO many people on the subreddit simply debate whether this would or wouldn't be the case with certain signings, and what improvements need to be a priority.

Also I would argue that this core doesn't have to be completely home grown at club (as in having been at the club since being 12) but that players like Lukaku, joining at 18. Or doing a Jones, as I call it. Which is buying a young player at 18, keeping him registered in the following 3 seasons to be classed as home grown at club whilst he gets a few games on and off. Oxlade and Jones are both examples of this and will continue to battle for their clubs for probably quite a few years. This is something we should focus on if the talents are not at our clubs at 18 can we bring them in and adopt them as it were from a young age. I agree that beyond 25 you don't really have the same attachment to a club you join necessarily. So doing a Jones is something I'd advocate for doing for big money that perhaps doesn't get brought up enough and certainly doesn't get enough support. Otherwise, we run a risk of seriously only having English players who can play a squad role for England and no ""England Stars"" as such. Buying Shaw would be an obvious target for Jonesing. Anyway I digress.

I agree in principle, but... No. The 70,40,30 speeds have no scientific basis as to why the limit should be set at these particular speeds. 
If cars had been capable of doing 100+mph when the big daily mail campaign called for a speed limit on the m1, it is quite possible that the national speed limit would be 80, or 90, rather than 70.
And this would still not be based on any scientific fact, survival rates, or other hard data. 

And whilst we are on with speeds, why not have a French system where it is 120kph in the dry, and 100 in the wet? 
Granted this being Britain we'd end up doing the 'wet' speed a lot, but it's an idea that's not been tried, to my knowledge. And at least this would then have an inference of science about the whole arbitrary business.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"See here's the thing.....none of us want to sell Bale, we would all love for him to stay here forever.  We get how good he is and how good he could potentially be.  We also see that we need some additional pieces to make not only Bale better but the team as well. We are becoming more noted internationally because of Bale and are in the midst of building a stadium. 

We also have major concerns that if we keep selling our top players that we will never land new top players and will never make the jump from a team competing for CL to a team competing for PL titles.

At £85m+ there is no player, coach or team in the world that would fault spurs for cashing in.  I don't think it would discourage other players from signing for us because frankly that is a shit-ton of money, an amount that no one is supposed to turn down because no one is supposed to be willing to pay that amount.

So then the question becomes if we lose Bale can we get enough pieces to allow the team to get better without him there.  We have a good team, a very good team but we need 2 strikers as it is with Bale, we could use a creative CM (Holtby isn't quite ready to be a star yet) we may need a LB.  We would then need to get a left wide player.  We could also use some depth (not a ton but some). Even at £85m i am not sure we can get enough really high end talent who fit our wage structure to make the jump to becoming a solid regular CL participant.

I don't think we end up selling Bale this summer because despite all his bluster Perez won't end up offering £85m+, i think he will come in at the £45m - £50m range and Levy won't budge at that point knowing that Bale is under contract especially since Bale hasn't made any indication he wants to move. Because keeping Bale for a season and getting CL is just as valuable if not more valuable than a 1-time payout of £50m.

But if Perez actually does come in at £85m+....well, we are all going to have to ask some tough questions about what to do.

You may be absolutely correct here, BUT from what I can tell the requirement for evidence of two years together is disconnected from any visa, or residence requirements. It can have been in any country, in a number of forms. Its merely a way to show the relationships is sustaining and genuine.

The things to be concerned about here returning on a visitor would be her keeping her job: obviously you need to keep her income in order to meet the detestable financial requirement. Also if you are applying from WITHIN the UK, you must be on a visa longer than 6 months. Otherwise you need to apply from outside the UK. Given the processing time can be up to 3 months that may make things quite unfeasible.

A note on the fiance visa: I'm fairly certain if you get this visa you're going to have to get married in 6 months. The UKBA website is fairly explicit on it not being a route to any other kind of permanent residency.

I'd argue that as a subreddit we're always for players coming in but we don't look at anyone leaving. We don't want people to leave or acknowledge our weaknesses well enough.

If we really are properly going through our squad and rooting out problems, selling them off and bringing in someone better. As we did with Kalou and Bosingwa. We have to be more realistic and talk about building a squad for time.

Personally, I'm worried about how Manchester United and Arsenal pick up English stars of the future at 18, keep them in their squads for 3 years, have them declared at home grown at club for the Champions league and help build the core leaders of their next team. We don't do this at all. We buy players at 18, and loan them out. They don't blend or have time with people at the club. When they actually join back up from loan it's like finally getting that transfer in. It may work for development as by all accounts these players I'm talking about are really good enough to be playing in our first team or playing rotationally, Oxlade is probably good enough to play every week now but he rotates him a lot. As Man U did with Jones. We could have done that with Lukaku. We should have done that with Lukaku. We need to do it with new English players.

* Sometimes winning isn't everything in life
* We have let down a lot of young talent, players who will thrive in leagues all over the world, and we will be buying back some of them at highly inflated prices
* Terry needs to go
* Our scouting is really bad. We don't spot good brimming talent at low costs. We tend to go for in-demand talent that everyone is looking at, but we can afford. Manchester Utd and Arsenal are great at that.
* Of our two strikers in January 2013, Sturridge should not have been the one to leave.

Just some of my thoughts. No need to downvote if you disagree. Maybe I'm wrong, but then again, I really love this club and want to succeed. And I think Mourinho's changed attitude will bring some vital changes to the club's mentality. It's becoming high time we start utilizing our brilliant Youth academy and the unparalleled talent coming out of it and become net exporters of quality talent rather than poachers of inflated talent. We can't really survive with the present mentality. RA will not always be there to invest, we need to look at the future and plan big time.

* The physical game in England - not that he can't handle it, just that he genuinely seems surprised by what people can get away with sometimes. He is nearly always pretty aggressive back at them without giving away a foul so I think he will adapt fine. 
* Language barrier - his English is coming along but it still isn't very good, I think this makes it hard for him to have as strong an understanding of his role and relationships in the team which blunts his impact somewhat. I think that Jose speaking Portuguese will be a big help to him.
* Being played on the wing isn't playing to his strengths, most of what is amazing about him is how he controls the tempo of the game, he plays people in left and right in the build up and pops up every where constructing plays and keeping possession. I actually think he is better at this than Mata but it is difficult for him to show it because of the above reasons. I think he has provided great structure in the few games he has played at no.10 for us, though I have to say Mata has a more incisive final pass. 
* The large volume of games might have been a bit of an overload in his first season. I think Hazard may have suffered from this a bit as well, but Oscar is more of 'thinking' player so there's more tactical information for him to learn and improve on during that overload, makes it a bit hard.

Problem is since we are team that has money (but not oil money) and we manage money very carefully means that we wouldn't be in the market for another world class player and we already have needs to be filled without losing a world class player.  There is no possibility of a Bale to Real with Spurs signing Cavani and Lewandowski to bulk up the squad, because we couldn't afford the wages even if we could afford the transfer.

What we would end up with is 1 or 2 exceptional players that we were able to find a bargain on (like Hugo, Jan and Mousa) and 4 players who need to develop.  But now we would have a big bank and teams would fight for more cash out of us.  So those ""bargains"" would be less bargain like.

Now if we had a few more pieces in place already (a couple strikers etc.) then getting £85m+ and being able to replace the wide player makes it all a bit more manageable.

I still don't know that we will sell, less from not being willing to take £85m and more from the fact that i really don't think Real will actually offer anywhere near that amount.  I could see Real offering £45m - £50m (still a great deal of money) and Spurs saying no and Perez going off to sign Suarez and someone else and saying that Bale is a target for the future and just hoping to see if we make CL or not and pouncing on Bale if we miss.",0,1370945543,null,0,false,0,cagiq7g,t3_1g3v1p,t1_cagiq7g,t1_cagidfu,null,1430850990,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

**Best/Worst rental areas around the university?**

Best: Ropewalks, up by Hardman Street, Upper Parliament - close to shops and the good bars
Worst: Moorfields is pretty tragic at night, barely any good value local shops too, avoid the business district, it's grim.

**Best/Worst real estate sites to use for the area?**

Best: None of them are particularly good, I've used Venmore and they gave me my full deposit back and I bought a place from Andrew Louis and they were okay.
Worst: I'd avoid Gumtree and private landlords, got shafted by a private landlord.

**What's the cost of living like?**

Comparatively low compared to the rest of the country.  I'd watch out in some places on Seel Street (Brooklyn Mixer, Salt Dog Slims), some bars like to think they're situated in London and fix their prices accordingly, which is shit, wages here are low in general.

**Any other general hints and tips for living and paying in Liverpool**

Don't do your shopping in Tesco, do it in Home and Bargains (never call it Home Bargains either).  Use St Johns, they have the cheaper shops, Wilkinsons, 99p shops, Aldi, all the usual suspects.

**Best bars? Prices? Where should be avoided (and when)?**

La'go, Aloha (both around Seel Street), Sound Food and Drink (Duke Street), Le Bateau for a club (Duke Street) when it's open, check Facebook.  If you're young/a rapist, you might enjoy the Krazyhouse.  Prices around the bars are generally reasonable, can get £2.50 a pint, sometimes lower.  The Pilgrim up by Hardman street is a cheap place, probably 2 quid for a pint, weird clientèle though, you may have to talk to a stranger.

Judging by this interview, for example, he might be more calm and collected than your average EDL member who comes out to get into a scuffle, but he speaks a load of bollocks. I know all politicians do it, but passing off claims that 'the government are scared of Muslims because they own a majority of the stock, ports and shopping centres in the country' is a load of rubbish.

Plus, however reasonable you think he is, he still ascociates him with the thugs who go around town centres telling the niggers to go home.

It's not that you're not from England. The problem is with the foreign element thinking that they know better. Thinking that they know better about how to behave in a stadium, about typical British fan mentality.

Younger players, while a higher risk (in that, for every Coutinho, there's an Assaidi), offer far higher rewards in my opinion. If they fit in well, like Coutinho or Sturridge (or even Hendo, this year) then we have a group of young players who develop together for years.  Alternatively, we could sell them for a profit and replace them with more talent. It may take longer, but in my opinion it's a much more fiscally responsible method and will be better for us in the long run.

With our current position, out of the CL, out of the EL as well, we'll really struggle to attract established talent that could push us back into the top 4.  These players would more than likely be playing for CL clubs already, meaning that the only real hope we'd have of nabbing them would be to throw obscene amounts of money at them.  Even then, there's no guarantee of us being able to overtake the 2 or 3 teams in front of us in order to get 4th. Then where would we be?

Employers want good employees. They want people who are competent, who can do their job effectively and who will not be a hassle. Nonetheless, if you are someone who is going to be difficult you can still get employed by having a good reference or by waiting long enough before being disruptive.

Those employers are not obligated to give everyone a job, and if they are looking to avoid people who cause trouble, particularly for high profile, time limited jobs, the existence of a list of people who actively harm projects seems logical and reasonable.

Granted, there should be more openness and transparency, but it just seems a better and more efficient version of what we have now. After all, we have lots of information about companies, their views on unions and the like, which we use to find out where we want to apply to.

true,mackacavs,null,null,"I have quite a few - these are the ones that my Chelsea supporting mates disagree with anyway. I don't frequent this sub too often so I'm not too sure about you guys...

1) (This one will be the most controversial one in here IMO) If, and it's a big IF, Roman wasn't willing to go on a big spending spree this summer i.e. £100m+ I could understand Jose selling Mata to raise funds. He would fetch £50m+ hopefully and he plays in a position where we're most crowded.

Mourinho could re-invest that money in a (potentially) world-class centre-back and centre-midfielder. I think we'd have a better chance winning the league next with these two pieces rather than Mata. Don't get me wrong I love Mata, but I can understand the logic in selling him if it were the only way Chelsea are/were going to operate with FFP and all that...

2) Furthering that, if I had to sell one of Mata, Hazard and Oscar today; I would sell Mata. I love the guy, and never want to see him leave, but I believe the other two will be better than him in time...

3) Contrary to popular opinion (certainly in /r/soccer, I'm not so sure about here tbh) we've killed it in the transfer market recently - De Bruyne, Lukaku, Courtois, now Van Ginkel probably, Cesar, Luiz, Moses (to a certain extent at least) - Chelsea have really hit the jackpot. If we sold all those players tomorrow we'd make close to £100m profit on all of them. And most of them haven't even played for us yet! If Wenger had made any of these signings /r/soccer would not get off his dick for weeks...

Moreover, our board has more idea of what it's doing than most people give it credit for. Either Emanelo is in fact really smart or there are scouts/other dudes who really know the game inside out...

4) (This was said earlier, but still) I really don't want us to make any big name signings - I just don't think Hulk and/or Cavani would be worth it (it makes my blood boil when I hear of £35m+ for Hulk - that would be just as bad as the Torres sigining imo - I hope it's just tabloid nonsense). (I think we shouldn't bring in Shurlle(sp.)  either, but that's not particularly unpopular I don't think). We should bring in Mangala, Van Ginkel and maybe Jovetic and then call it a day. Hopefully we will not have spent more than £45m on those guys.

5) We should sell Terry to Monaco for the £7m apparently offered. We'd save a lot on his wages and he's just not up to it these days unfortunately.

6) We should give Luiz one more year under Mourinho - if he can't sort out his obvious defensive issues that some fans still like to deny exist, we should sell him to Barca for £40m. We can re-invest that money in a genuinely world class centre-back and still have some money left over.

7) Bertrand will never make it here unfortunately, we'll end up selling him to some mid-table club in two years for about £5m.

8) I don't see the certain issues fans have with fans from other countries. I was born in London and have supported Chelsea since I was 5, but I don't think that a fan from anywhere else on the globe cares less about the club than I do. I, for one, welcome all our Chinese, American, Australian, Nigerian etc. friends...

9) I do think Mourinho was pissed off about not being offered the Utd job. I don't think he gave two shits about the City one, and even if he had been offered it, he'd have come here anyway. But I do think he's annoyed he was never offered the Utd one.

That's all I can think of for now!

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"I don't think we're any more stats-based than plenty of other clubs, to be honest.

FSG have realised by now that football is far more fluid and dynamic and team-based than baseball, and so doesn't lend itself to statistical analysis as easily (at least for now; who knows whether statistical analysis of football will improve). 

After all, what set of statistics do you think they would have used to sign Sturridge, given his lack of playing time till that point in the season, and him being played wide the season before? 

Also, this set of stats isn't too useful at all - it says a lot about Aspas' quality relative to the rest of his side, and given that his side were nearly relegated, you'd certainly hope he's a notch or two above his teammates.

What's far more important to FSG's 'transfers model', instituted properly in time for last January, is that the decisions aren't just made by one person, or even two people, but by a committee - which right now consists of (at the very least) Rodgers, Ayre, the head scouts.

true,gauchie,null,null,"I am a pacifist because I am lucky enough to live in a society where I can express my political opinions and criticise my government without resorting to violence. In my own society throughout history and in many others even today this was/is not the case. So we should be very careful about judging people from other societies and times by the standards that we have. Could I really say that I wouldn't resort to political violence if I weren't in the situation of Africans under apartheid when I have never lived in conditions approaching this? This is what terrorism is remember: it is the last resort of a group whose political views will never be heard and who will never be able to win a traditional war because they are up against forces much more powerful than them. Generally, such terrorist acts are considered more favourably by history where we agree with the motivating political views and less favourably where we do not. Which is why we gloss over the violence that went into the making of all the political entities we have today.

I think Mandela is an example of a leader whom most seem to choose either to label a 'saint' or a 'murderer' as you have. In my view his terrorist actions are understandable, albeit not agreeable. For me, his political and historical importance now lies in his existence as a figurehead of the fight against an enormously oppressive regime which is also representative of wider global struggles against racism and the way in which, despite everything he went through and his previous actions, he chose to embrace peace and a 'rainbow nation' after the end of apartheid where many predicted more violence.

I think it is important to remember his violent past, but not so that we can demonise Mandela as evil or a murderer or a terrorist but so that we can recognise that actually violence sadly plays an important role in politics and the vast majority of struggles but that it can be overcome.

In fact the vast, vast majority of famous British people through history have killed either directly or indirectly. I find it ridiculous that this country hates Mandela so much and cries about terrorists and murderers when we are no better. Nobody is really. Every time there is a topic on Mandela all the comments cry about how he is a terrorist and a murderer, yet we worship those kinds of people every day.

George Washington is a terrorist, but I doubt you will get any far right goons saying that. Churchill isn't just a terrorist, he's responsible for millions of deaths in the Bengal famine. Not to mention war crimes like Dresden. No, you won't get British people tutting at them though, in fact he is consistently voted the greatest Briton ever and is being put on currency. Frankly it's ridiculous how much stick these people get simply because of their skin colour. 

Don't throw stones in glass houses. Realise the only reason the likes of Mandela get villified is because he was a black person fighting white rule. When a white person colonises a country and fights wars they are heroes, the likes of Griffin only hate him because he's black. End of story. Otherwise he would be condemning every single person that's ever fought against every government ever in history. No he won't, he still loves Churchill, he still probably loves the batshit insane US and Washington. I'm pretty sure he likes Hitler. Obviously crazy old white men are his cup of tea.

The Tenth Doctor hides away on earth, taking the human form of a school teacher named ""John Smith"" (incidentally the second time he's done this exact thing, but in doing this a year earlier than the first time he did it, he's only done it once and didn't do it before one year later)

In the continuity we're familiar with, he gets turned back into the doctor, defeats the family of blood and carries on as usual. In a slightly divergent reality, he evades the family of blood but never becomes a time lord again (perhaps something happens to martha) He continues to live as a human. He has a family, he continues his studies and becomes a Doctor. The chameleon arch transformation isn't 100% so he doesn't age quite as quickly as he should, but he still gets old.
The dreams of his former life continue. 

His stories inspire his children to name their daughters, Barbara and Susan. Then after decades of work he completes a crude time machine, it's only slightly bigger on the inside and he can't steer it but it does look like the police box in his dreams.

All I see is someone trying to emulate CR by running at defenders but is not technically gifted enough to create opportunities. To compare him to the likes of Messi and Ronaldo is ridiculous.

Personally I have no problem with Hazard's attempts to emulate Messi or CR, I would want a player of that ilk in my team any day. All the hype is natural because that's what fans/people do - they idealize/romanticize the player. 

&gt; Almost every run he makes is into a bunch of defenders and he's forced to go back.

The no. of successful dribbles that have provided a spark to create something are far more than the ones that have led up to this. If he still maintains possession after attempting to beat his man then whats wrong with that?

That's what Chelsea has been lacking for some time a direct dribbler(Robben-esque) of the ball who attacks defenders and beats them . He'll  learn and mature that's for sure but at his age he's only second to Mata in quality, even been better in some games.

It's just tiring seeing these hypocritical cunts picking and choosing whatever they please purely on the basis of race. When people fight white oppression it's always terrorism and it's always the first point being made, and like I said as the West lurches further towards the right even Gandhi is being ever more vilified. So you don't even have to kill anyone anymore to be hated. It's a worrying prospect but especially moreso because its the youths that are getting along with it.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"&gt;Letting agents often seize the opportunity to cash in on this, as tenants leave at the first opportunity, which results in an annual turnover of new tenancy contract fees - something that costs individual tenants roughly £258 every year. 

1000 times this. There is no incentive to keep good tenants in of itself. LA's have no interest in that, as they make less money from stable tenants. And good tenants will leave a bad landlord/ea as soon as possible (as I did). This being the case, tenants move, a lot, even when not needed.

Coupled with the fact that lack of job security discourages buying due to necessitated mobility, house sharing is more common, and people often cannot stay together for too long due to diverging lives. This is a Letting Agents wet dream, as they can fee up to high hell. Fees which bare no resemblance to costs incurred.

Of course, most these fees are passed onto the new tenants. Which have little choice but to just succumb to them. And likely no visibility of them before sinking time into viewings. Unlike in Scotland, where such fees are illegal (which to me just means, built into the rental cost).

Honestly. Rental housing is **the issue** effecting me at the moment, and I would support any party or candidate willing to address it. Regulate LA's, fees and make them transparent. Support an organisation that allows tenants to rate landlords and letting agents, and maintains a database of issues, resolutions, costs, etc.

I would like to see regional tenant cooperatives. Organisations which tenants rent through. Such cooperatives could force LL/Letting Agents into acting appropriately by lowering the rent of entire sections of their portfolio should they act inappropriately.

But I am young, and my age group do not vote (because of a myriad of good reasons). So fat chance of anyone giving two shits there.

We don't have Champions League. We want Champions League. Everyone who plays for us, and we (may) bring in wants it too. The only way we can show potential signings is by showing this ambition and holding on to our prize assets.

We saw Szczesny complaining that his teammates were pathetic, celebrating Champs League as though they had won the league. If we sell Bale, we run the risk of turning into another arsenal, a feeder club for the giants. If we lose Bale, our hopes of CL qualification are severely dampened.

So Bale means ambition, but he is also a draw because everyone in the world wants to play with such a prolific player. Losing him means losing that draw.

Yeah but that's one of those ""great in theory"" ideas. The theory is that the Blacklist is only a marker, and that people on it should be interviewed (if they're qualified) but just given a bit more of a grilling to make sure.

The reality will be this. HR gets CVs in for a job opening, as part of their initial screening they'll check the blacklists, any CVs that crop up on the blacklists will go straight in the bin, then the next stage of screening begins. This will happen because: 

1) People are lazy. 

2) People tend to take extreme views of things (i.e. not on the blacklist = ok, on the blacklist = no way). 

3) Most jobs get far too many applicants, and any method of filtering will be used (I've heard of people throwing out all CVs with the words ""Curriculum Vitae"" on the top for example. Or even just discarding one half of the pile.). 

4) I have never, ever, encountered a competent HR department. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't work, work in HR.

So in theory, I agree it might sound like a good idea, but the problems I'm trying to highlight are the in practice problems. 

&gt;What you seem to be saying is that employers should be artificially limited in the information that they have to protect people who have done something to get themselves placed on this list. 

Perhaps they should be. I think that the scales should be tipped, slightly, in favor of the employee. Not too far, just slightly. I think this because on a level playing field, the employer wins. They have the resources and the options. It's easier to fire and replace somebody (especially in an economic downturn) than it is for a general office worker with no specialist skills to get another job. Most people can't afford to go without a paycheck. So it's always easier for the employer to screw the employee out of something than the other way round.

Fair enough, I should probably have put £50-55m instead. If Mangala becomes too expensive then I'd go for someone else in his place. Although I'm not sure on the market for centre-backs...

&gt; NO, he is already a top class cb, and will only get better. I agree though if Barca are willing to spend crazy money 45M+ (which they likely won't) we should sell, and I recommend Marquinhos as his replacement.

I think next year is a big one for him. If he can flourish under Mourinho then great, but I'm still not wholly convinced. And I couldn't turn down big money for him.

When there is high demand for a limited supply of goods, you do not artificially increase the amount of people now capable of buying it. For this, serves only to further increase the amount charged for the goods.

While that does ensure the debt locked into the existing market is well served, and thus prevents situations like negative equity, it just makes houses that bit more expensive. And that bit much more unobtainable for the next generation of buyers.

Instead. They should let prices continue to stagnate. They should let inflation rise. They should let mortgages become hideously unaffordable, as they should be.

//The Chatham House Rule originated at Chatham House with the aim of providing anonymity to speakers and to encourage openness and the sharing of information. It is now used throughout the world as an aid to free discussion. Meetings do not have to take place at Chatham House, or be organized by Chatham House, to be held under the Rule.// 

The reason they don't have minutes at the meetings is because people making high level decisions need to be able to have a space to negotiate and discuss stuff without constant press intrusion, especially with our 5 min attention span media, which will try to destroy a negotiation before it's even begun to create a story. If you look at peace processes from Northern Ireland to Israel-Palestine, progress comes when people are able to talk frankly, outside of the media bubble, without constant second guessing of their every word. It's a chance for people to be honest with each other and try to tackle complex, sometimes controversial issues without worrying about how the press is going to spin it.  If governments or businesses take any concrete action they must then become fully accountable, but they should be able to discuss things on an informal, confidential basis from time to time, it's very hard to run any sort of organisation if you don't have a space where people can just breathe easy and be honest with other without having to constantly consider what a third party and the general public thinks of their conversation. Think about the way the media covers politics, every word, every gesture, is scrutinised, if you were a politician or a business leader would you not just want some opportunity to be able to discuss ideas an informal way away from the spotlight occasionally? The secretive conspiracy vibe is not the result of sinister plots, but the result of an obsessive 'gotcha' media that doesn't process complex ideas in a rational way but instead grossly over simplifies them and twists and distorts the slightest perceived weakness or controversy to try to destroy any one they can.

I won't turn on Suarez.  I love him as a player and I genuinely believe that he's a good guy off the pitch.

He plays with so much heart and determination and he clearly loves the game so much.  I know he loves Liverpool dearly as well, but I also really understand why he wants to go at this point.  

If we keep him I'm going to feel so bad for him. I know he'll always play his heart out for us, but I want him to want to do it. I want him to be here because he wants to be here. I don't want any part of any player's time at the club to feel like it's forced upon them. He clearly wants out at this point, so I hope he's able to do so. He's brought a lot of the media circus he attracts on himself with his antics (and the club's abysmal handling of the Evra incident definitely made it WAY worse) but them and the FA really see, to be trying to scalp him at this point. If I was in his shoes, I'd want to get my family the hell out of the situation as well. Nothing is more important than family, especially to Luis.

Lampard should not have been given a new contract   
  
Ivanovic is a poor CB, he should only be playing RB   
  
Luiz is not a good midfielder   
  
Marin has no business on this team   
  
Mikel has been here for 7+ years and played 250+ matches and yet players who have been here for shorter periods and contributed less get less criticism and more leeway   
  
'Pivot midfielder' is not a position! the pivot is a TACTIC of staggering 2 DEFENSIVE midfielders, Oscar, De Bruyne, Lampard etc are not defensive midfielders and cannot play in a pivot, its mind boggling how often people spout that shit on here. 
  
This team is NOT better suited to play 433, the team doesn't even have the central midfielders to play with 2 in a 4231 how the hell would playing 433 help especially with Torres as a target man.
