It is probably the least efficient of all ways of procuring infrastructure.

I don't believe in free market extremism. My view has always been a mixed economy with state owned infrastructure paid for by taxes.

true,justwonderingyeah,null,null,"How hard it is to make a difference. 

I'm no altruistic superhero but every time I've tried to make a difference I've been shut down. I used to go to Sainsburys last year before close a couple of times a week and buy £10 in reduced goods to give to guys out on the street.

Not sure who but someone reported me because after three weeks of doing that I got a warning from some police on the street who had told me they had been informed of my actions and that I was to stop otherwise I'd be in ""trouble"". 

I spent £30 on £2 sleeping bags from Tescos as they were on deal and went round giving them to people roughing it. There was a group in a car park near me in North London that was run down and not used where a group of 5 congregated. It went from a wonderful high of feeling I'd made a difference to a crushing low when I found out a load of kids had poured buckets of water of them. You might think ""And, it's water?"" but if you're sat in winter with only one set of clothes and nothing else you'd be feeling pretty fucking upset. 

Then there's the occasions where you see someone being an absolute dick on the bus or something and no one steps up. Some teen wannabe hardmen are hassling some people? Everyone just shirks up.

I'm missing a tooth now because some kids didn't take kindly to stepping in for them physically harassing a girl on the night bus but I'd do it again. 

I don't know. My grandparents raised me to try and be civil and show some common decency but day in and day out I just feel numb to everyone.

-----------

**Edit**: I hate these ""OMG reddit gold edits"" but I guess it has to be done. While I'm absolutely smitten by your gift I'm going to advocate though that if anyone else is feeling generous to go to Tescos or Sainsburys, buy a load of reduced food, and just give it to someone who looks like they need it. Even if they throw it away or don't want it you tried to help someone.

He didn't seem to make that at all clear and so people had too much faith that he had to let down.

This is where I think 40 years is a bit long. If he becomes rehabilitated after, say, 20 years, he has then served sufficient punishment for his crimes and could be sent back into the community, where he is unlikely to murder again. Prisons shouldn't just be about punishment, and I think at his age, and his circumstances, he could be rehabilitated and see the error of his ways, which is much more important than just locking him up.

On the other hand, if he really is a nutter, who can't be rehabilitated, than he still has the life tariff, so they can turn down his parole appeal if they think he is still racist.

~~If [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colbert#Surnames) page is correct I would be inclined to believe that this is the original pronunciation of the name or at least the one he's used to.~~ There are a lot of American names and terms that reinterpret existing old-world names. 
In the case of Dutch, to give a few examples:

* Harlem = Haarlem (as in the brighter ""haha"" sound) 
* New Zealand = Nieuw Zeeland (""New Zaylahnd""), literally translated. The ""nieuw"" exists because the Netherlands already have a province called Zeeland.
* Brooklyn = Breukelen (this one I can't really spell out, the ""eu"" sound is unique to Dutch and Icelandic I believe)
* VanDerSloot = the original Dutch van der Sloot (""of the ditch"") which sounds more like ""vaughn dair slote""

~~I'm not saying either is correct, but the difference in pronunciation can be explained quite easily when you keep in mind where these names come from.~~

Copy pasted:

&gt; He's not a pacey player who plays off the shoulder of the last defender by any means. Nor will he set Elland Road alight with silky footwork. If that was what you were hoping for, you'll probably be disappointed.

&gt; He is however still a pretty damn good player, a bit of an all rounder. He's gone through a lot of dry patches goalwise, but that seems to be normal for Forest forwards anyway. He's scored important goals in the past for us, both to keep us up and to take us to the playoffs.

&gt;And he works like a motherfucker. He's the sort of striker who may not always put the ball away, but he makes a nuisance of himself, bothering defenders on the ball, always looking for space off it and can bump in goals from a set piece given half a chance. If you have a good partner for him, or an attacking midfielder who likes to play high up to support him, he'll come up good, though he struggles when left up front on his own as he has neither the pure skill or physical beef to fashion chances on his own.

&gt;If you can bring his confidence and fitness back and send him home in good form we'll be grateful. Just don't use him *too* well, there's only so much space at the top of the table!

Wild pigs were becoming a rarity when last I was there.  Otters were being reintroduced and doing moderately well.

true,MrFoo42,eng-lancashire,Red Rose,"Fortunately, it's just sensationalist bullshit. Quotes from the main University Union:

Members may have seen the shoddy hatchet job on our USS pension scheme on Newsnight last night, [repeated on the BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24657049) and then Radio 4 this morning, absurdly claiming that student fees might have to go by £1000 to fund the deficit.  Yet the [USS annual members report](http://mar2013.uss.co.uk/) on which the story was based (issued two weeks ago) shows that the deficit has in fact sharply fallen over the previous year.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the fake 'revelations' are timed to undermine support for our strike next week. 

So what is the reality?



* The scheme was officially 92% funded in March 2011, 77% funded in March 2012, 77% in March 2013, and 83% funded June 2013. This corresponds to an official deficit of £2.9bn in 2011 rocketing up to £11.5 billion by March 2013 but dropping to £7.9 billion just three months later.
* This incredible volatility gives a clue to the underlying problem with the official figures. Pension schemes are very long term investments and should be judged on that basis whilst the law requires that they are judged on short term criteria.  The huge pension fund deficits across the country reported in the 2000's, including the USS one, are as phoney as the huge surpluses in the 1980's. USS is in good health based on real world criteria: its income exceeds expenditure on a long term sustainable basis.
* Pensions are simply deferred pay.  And the proportion of University sector spending which goes on staff, including pensions, has in fact been in continual decline.  It was roughly 65% when fees paid by home students were zero and has gone down to about 55% now fees are £9,000.  If Newsnight really wanted to locate the reason for rocketing student fees they would need to look elsewhere than staff pay and pensions.
* Britain has one of the worst records in Europe in pensioner poverty, corresponding to our lead in inequality.  There are 20,000 to 30,000 'excess deaths' of elderly people in winter every year in Britain - dying of cold, hunger and diseases contingent on them.  This is the real pensions scandal.



Dennis Leach, Professor of Economics at Warwick University, has produced a [commentary](http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/dennisleech/entry/misleading_newsnight_item/) on the Newsnight report and on a [similar scare story from September last year](http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/dennisleech/entry/university_pensions_deficit/) which notes that much of the volatility in scheme funding is a result of the method of calculating future liabilities which is forced on USS by the pensions regulator.

Take for instance my house mate who buys Dolmio pasta sauces. What she has achieved by opening a jar could have been achieved by opening a tin of chopped tomatoes and adding some jarred herbs and seasoning. And yet she complains about the cost of living!?!

Also chopping an onion. One of the most basic skills yet people seem to treat an onion as if they were one of the guilty senators at the assassination of Caesar. The reason you are crying is because you've damaged the onion so much that the acid in it has made you cry. Not because the minute you touch one, they turn you into a blubbering wreck.

Being able to have basic culinary and kitchen skills can broaden your horizons in so many ways. You can feed yourself cheaply, live a healthier lifestyle (if you decide to do so), you can entertain family and friends, more importantly; you can seduce women/men.

I don't claim to be bloody Gordon Ramsay but i would like to think i'm good enough to live on a budget and eat well!

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I've replied to another post if you want to keep that going (I'd rather not) but I will add here that I'm sure Holtby could do a job in that position if we basically developed him into that sort of player. I don't think he'd be quite like Carrick--he's much more mobile than that--but he could be okay. 

I just don't get excited about it, and I think he'd have to change so much about his game that it'd be an absolute waste. Technically he probably has the passing range necessary, but mentally it is just a very different style of play. 

Ultimately I see it as completely pointless because we have two players who are already better at that job and we need someone to rotate with Eriksen in the hole.

There are so many things he would have to get better at to play a deeper role as his primary position. Isn't it just a lot easier to keep playing Dembele or Capoue who both dictate a game just fine? Capoue's passing tendencies are actually very similar to Carrick, so why not just play him rather than completely change Lewis's position?

Doctor Who is a monster of the week + occasional larger story tie in episode, like most sci-fi.  It wasn't always this way.  The first Doctor was all about running several episodes in a row for one story.  If you discovered something menacing along the way that added to the overall story, so be it.  Now we get the Doctor running down threats to Earth mostly every episode, interspersed with the occasional reference to something foreboding that usually ends up tying together in the last episode.

It's philosophical AND action packed.  It's really what sci-fi should be.  It asks basic human questions with a quirky, almost hokey delivery.  The Doctor brings along companions as a vehicle for us to understand what's happening, to be a representative of the human race, an Everyman.  They travel to learn, to play, to save those who are in danger.  He has no mandate or agenda, but you get the impression he's running from something and doing these good deeds to set something right in his past.

Each Doctor is different, and they adventures they have are as well.  He's a clever hero who wins despite the odds.  You can watch it to root for him or just to enjoy the ride.",0,1382719140,null,0,false,0,cczg36t,t3_1p79yl,t1_cczg36t,t3_1p79yl,null,1428986986,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Lots of people want retribution rather than justice and rehabilitation.  We've seen how this works across the world (hint: It doesn't - the most brutal prisons in the world are still packed).

So let's try and be better than that.

Pavlo Lapshyn did these things, they are horrible things and he needs locking away to keep us safe.  But have a read about ex-racist people for example to see how easy it is for people to fall into certain mind states:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1p48k6/serious_ex_neonazis_and_racist_skin_heads_of/

The on going theme there. . . normal people, for various reasons fell into an understandable trap.  Stop thinking of this kind of person as a monster, and more as a person and you might begin to understand why he'd do such a thing (that is in no way attempting to downplay what he did, not at all, what he did is despicable).

Which is why rehabilitation is important, sadly the services we offer based on three generations of my family working in the prison service are lacking (but it's been interesting to see how things have changed each generation).

Chavs, they tend to be nice people on their own but I have never in my life met a group of chavs who have been nice.

I despise them, they're horrible little cunts.

I've seen chavs hounding dogs, children, the elderly, bus drivers just about anyone.

It's a plague on this country and I wish I had never moved to where I am now simply because of chavs, there's other reasons but I could put up with them without so much as a complaint but from where I was (Very few chavs) they're like rats in Victorian London or Victoria Portsmouth or the back of a kebab shop.

I go to a college full of them, just doing plastering (I did Software Development but despised the course, so I stopped midway through the second year) and they come in and destroy peoples walls, throw sand-lime everywhere (Can literally blind you apparently) and are just evil little buggers the caretaker hates them because none of them have common decency or courtesy.

But like I say one on one they're fine, the group I work with almost all of the dickheads have dropped out (group of 15-16 now down to about 6) and now we only have 1 or 2 serious chavs but they're alright people because they're on their own.

I don't get bullied by them personally, but I see them bully other people even those they apparently consider their friends.

I could go on all day about them but still don't get me wrong, they're my countrymen and despite them being vicious little bullies I want them to have every opportunity to get their acts together.

Most people would still not be able to design the parts themselves so you'd still need to buy the 3-d models which would lead to a demand for the model makers and an outlet that sells the models for download.

The printers themselves will still be expensive for the first little while so it will give some small outlets an opportunity to get on the manufacturing ladder for themselves. If you're a small hardware store you could print stock to order rather than having to carry a wide inventory of stuff.

The interest we pay on this debt (the debt is currently about 91% of the UK GDP) is about the same as the total UK Defence Budget and goes to these various organisations. In as much as these organisations are based in the UK, a proportion will re-enter the UK economy in the form of employee purchasing power and tax receipts (although the companies are very adept at minimising tax payments. 

When the BoE buys in (effectively redeems) government bonds in QE it is a double edged sword. They are reducing the annual interest payments and, more importantly, reducing the debt mountain making the economy look good. However, at the same time, they are spending money (some of which will return to the UK economy) in order to achieve this. The idea is they are injecting these funds into the money supply in order to (apart from other things) reduce interest rates. As a result, the idea that QE increases government finances in the short term is incorrect and the opposite is true. The government has used some of it's funds to buy back the bonds and has, in this way, increased the money supply in the economy.

The other issue is the one of scale. If you realise the current national debt is 91% of GDP it is obvious that the amount involved in QE is only small by comparison.",0,1382725719,null,0,false,0,cczisg2,t3_1p6q95,t1_cczisg2,t1_cczgx93,null,1428985725,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

One reason you end up with inflation is too much money chasing too few goods and services ie excess demand over supply. In post WW1 Germany, there would have been very little non-military production. If the government started printing money there would be very little for the people to spend it on and so prices would rise. 

It's different today (or rather since the '70s when the UK banks really started ""printing"" money). There's plenty of ""supply"" so when money is ""printed"" there are things for people to spend it on so inflation doesn't tend to be such a problem.

But at the same time I don't believe any man willing to lead a revolution, such as I am, should be allowed to run a country. It seems just as morally bereft to me that I would lead a large group of people into battle (for want of a better word my revolution would be non-violent) only to serve my own political agenda. 

Now, I'm not an anarchist as such I believe we need some form of government but one that is decentralised from London and one that works for the people. Perhaps a series of mini governments that all report to one larger government. But what's important is that the issues are decided by the people who have been educated in facts and not rhetoric.

My goals would be to create true democracy and to shift the attention away from the directions of one man telling his minions in the House of Lords / Commons what to do. And to create an electoral system free from gerrymandering.

So I would briefly hold power with a team of advisors whilst putting these systems into place and create an order to remove me forcefully if I had not removed myself within a set timeframe necessary to put these systems into place.

That government would then create its political system with the express goal of serving the people and avoiding corruption to the best of their abilities. 

I appreciate you saying you don't know enough about it because the wonderful thing is no-one does. If anyone has a cheat sheet we'd be using it. But to date every political system created has failed in one way or another, and that's the reality of politics. That's why the House of Commons sit and bicker about it because it's all an experimental process. But the current experiment has failed and needs to be terminated. 

I don't know either but I've spent my entire life winging it and I can ""just wing it"" again.

•Having someone central with good ball control could alleviate our dependency on this ""holding mid role"" and allow us to be a little more fluent and compact in midfield if Gerrard and co. can trust who's behind them (Agger).

It really annoys me that on these forums people write bad things about companies when they have no knowledge of them and what they have to offer.
blink driving schools cost is a realistic price if you want to join a franchise that has no hidden costs, if you become qualified they provide a car all you do is insure it which costs about £10 a week, your exam fees are covered for two attempts, part 1 would cost £90 a go, part 2 £111 and part 3 £111, then you have the cost of an ORDIT registered trainer for part 2 and part 3 for which you are looking at about 60 hours at £30 an hour, that is included. Also for your training you get access to 3 websites all the books needed and telephone support should you need it. upon qualification you are guaranteed a job, a sales promo is held at your local shopping centre with sales people filling your diary so you have work from day 1, new provisional license holder leads are bought for you in your area by blink, and mail drops are done in your area. this is on going for as long as you need it.
My advice from my experience is to speak with Simon and he will arrange a meeting with you at no cost and be prepared with whatever questions you have in your mind, do a bit of homework on the likes of RED to see what you are actually getting for your money.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; We allow the market to dictate every other price we pay, so why should renting be any different?

Because there's a limited supply of homes (and land upon which to build them), and everyone needs one.

Having a roof over your head is almost unique in terms of need, in that people have no alternative.

We allow the market to determine the price of TVs and Android tablets, because if you don't like the price that Samsung is charging then you can buy one from Sony or Apple instead. 

Not only that, but if you think TVs and iPads are too expensive, you can just do without one.

If your political opinions were considered and sound, if you have thought them through from bottom to top, you would not need to ask ""why should houses be special"", instead you would already have recognised their importance.

I'm pretty sure that this is covered in the first weeks of A-level economics, alongside agricultural subsides, which the government provides to ensure there is no shortfall in essential supplies. That's a second market in which we do not ""allow the market to dictate [the] price we pay"".

It would be a pretty shitty society we lived in if we allowed people to starve so that farm owners could export their potatoes to more profitable markets. Such an event was proportionally one of the worst famines in modern times and killed 12.5% of the Irish population.

Likewise, it's a pretty shitty society which allows people to live homeless or in fear of eviction because the profit and property ""rights"" of the hereditary rich are prioritised over the essential needs of the common man.

(If you wish to say anything about buying houses, you should recognise that the rental and property-buying markets are in a kind of equilibrium, whereby those buying homes cause a fall in rental demand; investment property buyers affect both markets. I'm sure there is an economic term for this, but the point is that people can't just go elsewhere).

As I recall property was one of the most profitable safe investments of the last decade, so your anecdotes about problem tenants doesn't seem to match the numbers. ",0,1382730910,null,0,false,0,cczkzer,t3_1p6lnj,t1_cczkzer,t1_cczduic,null,1428984702,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Funny how the admins removed /r/politics from default for being a ""liberal circlejerk"" but do nothing about /r/worldnews which is a fucking nazi circlejerk. 

And notice how nobody in the mainstream subreddits ever complains about worldnews? People only complained about atheism and politics and the ""liberal"" subreddits. So the admins reacted accordingly, yet somehow reddit is full of ""left wing idiots"" said by the majority and upvoted to the top. You just have to look at /r/circlejerk nowadays, it's gone from decent satire to ""lol black people"" ""I'm so edgy"" ""I'm not PC, fuck niggers, atheists and anyone else, look how different I am, I'm so reactionary""

As a whole, reddit is fairly conservative nowadays. The past year and a half the website has changed MASSIVELY in terms of demographics and political leanings but most people refuse to believe it, even when  racist/right wing comments are always consistently voted to the top in almost every thread. It is very, very conservative. People get upset if you make jokes about Jesus or America nowadays. 

Any thread in which a minority (read: non white) has done something wrong, a thread about Roma, or black people, or Indians, or Chinese usually has comments that would put 1930's Germany to shame. But when it comes to someone white, only then do people start talking about ""stop bullying"" and ""stop being mean"". 

At the end of the day maybe the ""younger generation"" is more liberal but you also have to remember a large subset of the population grew up now during the entire War on Terror and were basically raised by the likes of 4chan, so there's also massive amounts of far right extremism and basically neo Nazism too.

 because the US is just doing SO well on those issues, just recently your government shutdown over affordable healthcare, did your guns help?

&gt;There are millions of defensive gun uses every year in the US...of all kinds...rapes prevented...robberies prevented...etc. Last study was 2.5 million per year. 

 then maybe you guys should work toward solving the crime issue  instead of using guns as a stopgap.

If you believe killing any person for any reason makes you a murderer then I have no problem with you calling Thomas Begley a murderer.

However most people don't actually believe this. They change their opinions on killing people given the context. For example in a war a combatant who kills a combatant is not usually called a murderer (he is often lauded as a hero). And a British or American soldier who massacres civilians is guilty of 'Collateral Damage'.

I think it is obvious that Thomas was trying to kill combatants. I think it is also obvious that he killed himself and therefore the other 9 people accidentally. That is why I don't consider him a murderer.

Because as an innocent citizen I feel I have the right to some privacy while talking to my loved ones.

I wouldn't expect every bit of mail I send in the post to be opened, scanned and stored.  Why should I expect anything different for my digital communication.  I wouldn't want CCTV in every single room in my home, but what GCHQ / NSA have been doing is even more powerful than that.

GCHQ and NSA are actively attacking that.  That is why I feel threatened.

But it's bigger than me and my pathetic little life.

But I worried about a bigger person with more ambition and upsetting certain powerful people, that's when I'd be really worried since they could have access to me entire life.  I'm more worried that GCHQ / NSA are spying on every single person that attends our best universities so they can blackmail and shape future policy.

That or there's a very real chance that one day our Government won't be so ""centre"".  We could have a movement like Germany did (LOLOLOLOL GODWINSZZZ!!!) and they would have access to an unprecedented amount of detailed information on every single person in this country.

The more philosophical security/privacy debate is kind of similar. Some people take either position as an absolute (I'm not happy for the government to have access to phone records ever because it's a gross violation of personal freedoms/government should be able to read everyone's email at any time if it stops a suicide bomber). Again, I believe the best course is somewhere in between.


Trouble is, and again it's just my personal opinion, it isn't possible to form a truly fair and informed position in the security/privacy debate without information coming into the public domain that would totally compromise the security element, or taking it entirely on faith and totally compromising the privacy element.

Hell, I don't even really care that people stored my metadata because on its own that's really fucking useless.

However, I do not agree with the absolutely gigantic, behemoth, humongous data mining programs they have been running like Tempora or spying through social networks with things like SocMint. They are inherently dangerous because your political opinions, sexual preferences (web filtering makes me especially nervous with regards to this, but not out of shame or anything like that), deepest secrets, and so on and so fourth are then freely available to the state. History dictates that this can end absolutely horrifically. These are the kind of things McCarthyism THRIVED on, or even worse...the Stasi. The very same Stasi who could only have dreamed of such volume of easily attainable information. The idea that fascism could never happen in Britain, or any other modern Western countries sounds like famous last words.

However, will any of this really stop terror? I really don't think so. You'll catch the odd utter moron who is dumb enough to plot this shit in easily accessible forms of communication. You'll even get the odd international plot maybe.

What is stopping them from detonating weapons in the crowded streets around a football ground like Ibrox on match day? The death toll would be enormous. What is stopping them from blowing up a vital transport link like Paisley Gilmour Street that feeds commuters into Glasgow daily? Or even Central Station? Or something as simple as just ploughing down revellers on a night out in busy weekend streets? Absolutely nothing. Israel gets the shit bombed out of it, as does Iraq and do any of them simply give up and never leave the house? They may be scared, but they can't, they won't. If they do, the terrorists and any other belligerents win. A more local example would be Britain and Ireland during the height of The Troubles.

Osama Bin Laden apparently said that all he needed to do was bait the West into expensive conflicts that would ostracise us. Scare us to the point that we allow our governments to destroy the civil rights that makes liberal democracies the only real alternative to anarchy out of nothing more than fear. Possibly forever. Then he would have won. It looks like he might be right.

Nevertheless, I am not the only good soul. There are certainly those in government and our security services that feel uncomfortable about all of this otherwise we'd never hear about it. Maybe, just maybe we can put enough pressure on our governments and their lackeys that they change their course and reassess their strategy to return to what was. One thing is absolutely certain though...

It needs to be changed to some form of proportional representation, because with what we have now, politicians focus on key swing constituencies, ignoring everyone else, and many voters are forced to choose between tactical voting (""the lesser evil"") or voting for who they really believe in (commonly viewed as ""the pointless option"").

I am well aware that not all PR systems are created equal, but there are some great alternatives out there - First Past the Post is pretty much the worst ""free and fair"" voting system, and we already have PR for European elections with nary a complaint. Yes, it is embarrassing that Nick Griffin is an MEP, but I think this is partly due to the low turnout in European elections, and the perception that the European parliament doesn't matter much compared to Westminster.

The first past the post voting system has all sorts of pernicious effects.

The fact that Labour have no serious challenger to the left in England, except in Brighton, means that to some extent, they can take a large proportion of their base for granted and not care about what they think, and that's not good for democracy. Although they can't take their base for granted completely, because they do have serious challengers to the left in Scotland and Wales.

The Tories do actually have a ""serious"" challenger - or at least vote-splitter - in England in the form of UKIP, but that's only because UKIP are blessed with a single issue that unifies and inflames their voting block, and people don't look at their other policies too closely, or vote for them as a protest vote and don't care about their policies.

true,Lakey91,null,null,"I think the specific reason why this sub is so left-wing is similar to why giraffes have stupidly long necks, peacocks have stupidly ornate plumage and stag beetles have stupidly huge antlers: runaway positive selection.

The theory is that if females of species select males for certain qualities (or sometimes the other way around), then those things increase in that population due to ""runaway sexual selection"". Of course it is all relative, so they'll keep selecting the giraffe with the longer neck and the peacock with the shinier feathers even when these traits become survival disadvantages (because they're still reproductive advantages). Of course, short necks and small antlers become selected out and cease to exist.

How does this relate? Well if you take a population on a reddit sub, then you'll likely have a subpopulation of opinion that outnumbers another. This opinion will be upvoted, whereas the other will be downvoted, simply by weight of opinion. This encourages the one type of opinion and discourages the other. Eventually people with the other opinion start to leave (or cease posting), and people of the popular opinion become more bold; the more extreme views become normalised and it becomes a competition to become more and more of that ilk as these views get more and more upvote weight as the dissenters leave. Eventually, even moderate supporters of the one position start to post less often as they see the more extreme views get +35 where they get a +3 or +4.

Most people on reddit are left leaning (age and left-leaning education) so a leftward shift is inevitable as subs get large enough to make dissent into a -20 vote offense.

I saw a comment on /r/ukpolitics that ended with ""Michael Gove fucks kids"" with about +20 karma.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt;On the one hand, I kinda expect an adult from Europe to know what a schnitzel is.

If I'm any example of a typical Brit...

We've all eaten schnitzel. We eat lots of it. We don't call it schnitzel, ever. We eat chicken, turkey and veal schnitzel. We call it escalopes, and while escalopes aren't always breaded they're very often done that way.

We've all probably heard the word schnitzel, but some of us will know it's a style of meat, some of us won't. Many of us would not be confident enough to order it without knowing more.

To give you an example, we're told the French call us ""les rosbifs"" (the roast beefs) and in the UK roast beef isn't just a joint of beef roasted in the oven. If you say you had a roast for your Sunday dinner you'll be expected to have eaten roast beef, some kind of potatoes (typically roast), often Yorkshire pudding, and a couple of vegetables - e.g. broccoli, carrots, cauliflower etc. 

So while our friends on the continent might know what roast beef is, they may not know that it's pretty much a description of a whole meal.

true,gorealm,eng-norfolk,Norfolk County,"A lot of your points make sense when levelled against the past or present state of cars, but make much less sense when thinking about the future. Cars keep on improving. 
You mention the deaths caused by cars, but every source I've found seems to indicate a huge reduction in fatal road accidents over the past few decades. Cars keep getting safer. If the promise of self driving cars becomes a reality then road accidents could become very rare indeed.  
You mention the air pollution, but again, emissions have been drastically reduced too. When electric cars started getting media attention I thought it would be nothing more than a fad. After all, the electric car predates petrol cars (as far as I know). But to my surprise, electric cars are still being talked about, still being built and improved upon, so it seems only a matter of time before they become ubiquitous and air pollution becomes a non-issue.
Indeed, no one wants to live on a main road, due to the noise and pollution, but of course, electric cars would deal with those problems.  
As for reducing the chances of conversing with the neighbours, I consider that to be a profound benefit.

Do you have a right privacy if you take **zero** precautions to ensure that privacy? If you popped a postcard in the mail do you expect every single person it comes into contact with just to pinky promise they won't peek at it? 

No, of course not. You either accept that it's possible to read it *or* you put in the effort to prevent people from reading it.

The internet is *mostly* postcards. When you hit send on an email its literally just sent as-is through a multitude of servers who dutifully pass it along to where it needs to be.

Public transport expenditure per head is £2700, over three times as much as the next highest region. It has six international airports and has the cheek to complain this isn't enough. HS2, if it goes ahead, will primarily benefit London by draining money from the other cities along its route.

It also cheats when being compared in size with other cities in the UK. Compare the commonly used sizes for London and the next biggest city, Birmingham. London is 8 million. Brum is 1.1 million.

* Huddersfield Town haven't won in their last five games, with their last two being losses.

* Huddersfield have James Vaughan - their main goalscorer with nine goals out of the 14 (or so, I think these stats are accurate but haven't double-checked them) scored by Huddersfield this season - suspended.

* Leeds are coming off the back of an emphatic victory against Birmingham, with key players such as Byram and Austin seemingly on the verge of finding form. Moreover, the new 3-5-2 formation seems to suit our players and get around our chronic lack of wingers, not to mention width in general.

* We've just signed Dexter Blackstock, which will give the fans and staff a morale boost because support for McDermott from the boardroom has finally been demonstrated. More importantly, this gives us added strength in depth and an extra goalscorer (**with pace**) in the team. I don't see him starting against Huddersfield - that would be unfair to McCormack and Smith, surely - but I envision him coming on in the second half if we need a change up front.

Whilst it's a nice way to feel morally superior to everyone else involved, it ignores the fact that companies in general *are* inherently accountable to the public and their feelings, both directly (we buy their products) and indirectly (our politicians regulate them).

So no, they aren't *legally* obliged to pay more tax, but that isn't really any reason not to criticise them for a perceived lack of contribution. By directly avoiding them, we all have the power to change their behaviour, and by making this opinion clear to the government we show that we will accept (or even expect) their legal tax requirements to increase.

All you're really saying is 'it's legal therefore it's okay'. The absurdity of this argument should be plain - many things done by many people and organisations are totally legal but can and are criticised, either directly affecting the recipient, or indirectly changing the legal landscape.

Edit: Just to give an example, Nestle has been famously boycotted, in some cases for a very long time.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"A couple of issues crop up to me:


* **People would be more likely to vote when they are interested in an issue:** Look at the European Parliament representatives for the UK. There are a much higher proportion of UKIP members than there are UKIP supporters in the UK. This is because when someone is interested in Europe (like supporters of UKIP), whereas if they are apathetic towards Europe, they won't vote. I would expect a similar thing to happen with this voting system. More people would vote if they are interested in the issue, so it wouldn't be a true representation of public opinion. People wouldn't vote, so minorities would get more power.

* **It gives more power to the press:** I think we can all agree that the press have a massive influence over voting in out country. They can make or break individual MPs or entire political parties if they so choose, at least in respect to their readers. Something similar would happen with policies. Papers would essentially tell people how to vote. This would have a detrimental effect on our government, as the press would get much greater powers. This would also lead to more knee-jerk reactions, with people voting on stuff based on what they just read in the newspapers.

* **People wouldn't read the bills:** I don't believe everyone would put full consideration into the bills, rather voting on names, what their friends or the press say, or by their preconceived notions. While I don't necessarily think the government is much better in this respect, I don't think putting the same issues to the public would get much better results.

* **Online requirements:** This is more of a minor one, but this political system would exclude those unable to use the internet, or don't have an internet connection. Unless there was some basic free internet connection offered, I don't think this policy would be fair to either the elderly or the poorest, who don't or can't afford internet connections.

* **Falsifying of votes:** This one may be correctable, but there is a possibility that someone could hacking into the online system and falsify thousands of votes, therefore giving individuals the ability to dictate government policy. 

* **False legitimacy:** This could give the government a false legitimacy on the policies they put in place. For example, only 10% of people could vote on a bill, yet the government could claim, because it was put to the public, all the public agree, and therefore they should not budge on that policy. 

---

I think these reasons are all legitimate enough to count as criticisms, but if you disagree with any (or all) of them, or I have some facts wrong, feel free to tell me off. I think a lot of it comes down to me being cynical of the public's ability to vote on facts, rather than gut feeling and whatever the press tell them is right.

But the other points i've shown with sources (from parliament with the justice department's own statistics) shows that there is an institutional bias, with guidelines explicitly telling judges to give women lighter sentences for the same crimes for the same severity - the lack of prisons not mentioned or explicitly stated as the reason. Just that ""they suffer disadvantages""  Is this misogyny? That women are seen as children and incapable of being accountable for their crimes? 

It's clear that it's institutional bias due to societal myths and prejudices, ie. women are seen innocent and weak, sweet and spice and everything nice.

I luckily never really got on with opiates or benzos so the only really fucking predatory drug that claws at my brain is booze, which is a thing anyone can relate to one way or another. Maybe not in quite the same reference frame as a broken boozehound, but consider a hangover as being 'normal' and you're halfway there.

meh, the bits and bobs we imbibe or toot, or snort or shoot are not really anything about who we are, usually there's just a sort of kid underneath, just half angry and half embarrassed that their ruse has been busted. :)

I still like to play with dangerous and exciting things though. 

I'm probably just a junkie, wreckhead, dickhead but I don't care though, if it inspires thoughts like "" we should be nice to each other"", and ""I'm sorry I was so angry on the internet on the other day"" and ""I think I could make a better song than that one song I did that one time"". then I don't really give a shit, I'm at least going wrong in the right direction.

No, but the risk is so small that you can pretty much guarantee that you will be able to live for your entire life without ever seeing a crime committed using a firearm. You can't say the same for the United States.

Amazon is usually the best price, or close to it around. With Flubit I expect I'll always get the best price this way.

Here's an example of the food processor I got. The Amazon price was already the lowest around, and that's me getting nearly an extra tenner off that.

let me put it this way, there is no rule that says they owe that tax, there is no legislation even hinting that the tax is due. it is not even written down that they should pay it, and yet somehow they are supposed to have an unwritten responsibility to pay more tax than they are asked for. 

Yes they are accoutable to the public in those forms but since the rules set by the public (in the form of laws set out by our politicians) don't demand the taxes they should feel under no onus to pay it, so by our own account as a society there is no expectation for them to pay it.

 the fact that it is legal makes it morally acceptable according to the view of society as we are living in a democracy, anything else would be exactly equal to saying that you should give 99% of your personal income to charity because good causes deserve money or you are a bad egg, the rules set out what is expected of a business, you cant get mad at them for not taking the initiative to give over more money than they are even asked for, that's not fair

what's more if the rules set out that they should pay more tax they would pay more willingly, they make no moves to undermine or bend the law.

 as a society we have created these loopholes specifically to encourage a certain kind of investment, and then you act as if you have been wronged when people then make these investments which is what the government wanted them to do in the first place.

 nestlé is different, they get away with breaking laws because they use their wealth and rescources to, shoot any legal claims against them out of the water and exploit corruption in the governments of these counrtries, this is a far cry from legally using tax law to mutual advantage.

It is obviously one of the most detested of crimes, and understandably why.  However, it's a sad but obvious fact that paedophiles exist despite all laws and taboos against them. Presumably there are far more than those who act on their urges. For those that do, the current model doesn't seem to really be working.

Perhaps if some of them felt they could go to someone and try to discuss and how to deal with it, and all questions about their sexuality, more constructively before ever acting on it (without fear of immediate arrest) it might be better to aim to push them in that direction than demonise them and force them to hide and repress. Deal with it from an almost medical standpoint first with criminal as a last resort. 

Repression of sexuality, and taboos about discussion of it, seems to have been the driving force behind many of the awful acts in the church for example.

Coutinho is exactly the same - he has no real pace, but has more than enough technical ability to make up for it.

true,speedboatjesus,null,null,"&gt;we can only know if they're doing something useful and worthwhile by rendering it no longer useful or worthwhile!

That is a very valid point!

Another problem with what they do is that we don't really hear about the attacks that they prevent; because they prevent them. But there is a lot on the line, so when they do fail it is a tragic event that everybody talks about for years afterwards. 

I know this is america, but I came across [this](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/10/18152849-unaware-of-tsarnaev-warnings-boston-counterterror-unit-tracked-protesters), which is a worrying example of something that possibly could have been prevented. It is very possible that similar ""holes in the system"" could be in GCHQ, although I would like to hope not.

In an ideal world, the people in charge of all this surveillance should be able to be trusted to make the correct decisions on how to approach it, gaining the relevant information they needed without encroaching on people's privacy.

The opposite end of the spectrum would be an open debate, where all details of the operations are shared so that the public may take it all in and make an informed decision.

I just had an idea.

If we could find just a small amount of people who could accurately represent the opinion of the people, then the information could only be shared with them and they could decide on the best action to take.

Then I remembered that that was what politicians were for.

I know it's only one issue, but it seems like a pretty big one. So I feel this is a good representation of how the political system is broken.

I think it is important for people to see politics for what it really is at the moment. Which from where I'm standing appears to be one big shit-slinging circle jerk.

Reading through the post on the front of /r/unitedkingdom about ""if you had just one gripe about the UK"", the [3rd](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1p6waa/youre_allowed_to_gripe_about_one_thing_about_the/cczcr63) and [4th](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1p6waa/youre_allowed_to_gripe_about_one_thing_about_the/cczcaj2) replies show that there are people that are as disenfranchised about the people that represent us as I am.

Infact I'm watching Question Time on BBC2 and they have just started discussing how people are losing faith in the political system, so there must be quite a few of us.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that we need to evolve the system, improve it. That includes us as a population giving more attention to politics, getting past all the appearances bullshit you get and actually reading up on things. It is the age of fucking information, we should be utilising it! 

This in turn would hopefully give rise to a change in the way we vote as a nation, bringing people to the political table who actually give a shit about dealing with the important issues correctly.

It also involves improvements to the way information is gathered. If you haven't heard of it, I recommend reading up about [ThinThread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinthread), which was an alternative way to manage the the mass of data the NSA was sucking up.

Sorry, I've ended up going off on one. I'm just trying my best to put this all together, as I'm sure a lot of people are.

TL;DR - Change needs to come from the people really. We need to pay more attention to the real politics and important issues, and learn to identify bullshit better.

true,GeordieFaithful,eng-TyneWear,Tyne and Wear,"That statement about shooting at police was highlighted by Raul Moat. Northumbria Police were always going to get him and even accepted tracking help from Ray Mears. Unlike the Americans who would have blasted his head off on sight, the officers tried to negotiate with him and make him face the full force of the criminal justice system. Bearing in mind that he had just killed one man, several injured his ex and blinded one of their colleagues. 

On that aspect of the case as well, do you really think if PC David Rathband had been armed he would have had time to react to this guy? 

This one lone gunman was front page news for nearly a week! In America, it's just a case of 'oh, another shooting'.

It took two accomplices to arm Raul Moat because of the strict gun control. We only look to America to see what would happen if anyone was allowed to buy guns, sure, in most cases they would be used responsibly. But as soon as one person has a mood swing, or has anger management issues', you've got a US style shooting on the cards. 

We're a civilised people, we obey the law and those who don't face the justice system. Vigilante justice does not work and never will. Untrained, inexperienced and trigger happy civilians fearing for their safety would be an unavoidable consequence. It happens in America, you see people taking the law into their own hands and people die as a result.

Right, because we don't share your gun culture, our criminals resort to knives, yet you think it's okay to take the piss out of knife laws? Obviously it makes sense, stop trying to be the ""big guy"" who laughs at such idiocy, because hey, you have guns right? Knives are nothing!    

Just because you Americans can have a shotgun, it doesn't make you big. It doesn't make you better. It doesn't make you clever.  It doesn't make you in any way superior. Don't try and come across like you're the bigger man because ""Our tools are better than yours."" Fuck off. 



 
&gt; Hell, a friend of mine in Brighton was the victim of a home-invasion robbery and all he could do was grab a golf-club, with his wife and infant in the next room. A golf club. The 2 thugs just laughed at him, grabbed a few more things, and then left like they owned the place. WTF kind of society is that?   

One that doesn't think ""I've shot someone in the face and took a life, because I am awesome and this is freedom.""  

We don't want your gun culture here.  

We don't want to be like you Americans, where schools get shot up, innocent children get shot on the streets, yet the moment the argument of ""Let's restrict guns"" comes up, you all zealously defend the ""freedom"" of keeping fire-arms. It's fucked up. We don't want to be like you.   

And what's your argument to that? ""Well, you can say that about guns, but your country is full of knife crime""? You've just taken the piss out of knife crime. You've just taken the piss (jeeeezus) out of our knife control. Fucking idiot.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Eriksen is *the* creative player in our side. The first few games without him, Soldado and other attacking players could barely get a touch of the ball in a dangerous position. With him in the side, we have an established link between the midfield and the attack. He's good on the ball, has good movement and distribution and demands the ball. 

Not that Holtby isn't capable of these things or isn't playing, because he is, but he is more of a box-to-box type player. He has to always be involved and is all over the pitch. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but going forward can be difficult when you're number 10 is picking up the ball in front of your defense or is off to the side when you're on the counter from tracking back and challenging the opposition. 

Basically, Eriksen is at his best when he is playing in the middle of the field and his best his far too good to sacrifice by pushing him out wide. Holtby is best wherever he can get the ball or be involved in the action, which is why we see AVB use him in so many different midfield roles.

However I realise that our disagreement probably largely stems from our biases (the culture that we were brought up in). That is why I stay out of the American gun debate. And the only thing that can convince me to support gun rights in the UK are hard facts. The statistics from either side of the debate are patchy at best (because different countries seem to paint different pictures) and that is not good enough for such a drastic change.

Actually, in this case, you can. You can withdraw your child from religious education. At any case, that the odds may be stacked up does not warrant any anti-democratic statements that say he should ""get out"" if he doesn't like it. Being in a minority opinion and/or holding an opinion that may never come to be is not grounds for being told to leave. That's the language of fascist states, not modern day democracies.

&gt;I'm being entirely consistent. The best advice for people who can't stand Christianity is not to live in a Christian country.

This is not a Christian country, by the way. We have archaic institutions that exist from the time we were a Christian country but our Christianity is in a sense for appearances only now. and I must ask on this point: Are you saying that people should be taught that Christianity is true in school?

Also a hypothetical: Suppose we could not publish anti-Christian literature here. Suppose we could not publicly criticise Christianity. Would you say the same thing to someone who wanted that to change? Would you tell them to leave?

&gt;Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean you have any hope of achieving whatever it is you want.

No, it doesn't but you have every right to argue for it tirelessly on every available format if you like. Saying someone should leave your country of birth for holding a minority opinion is disgusting.

I mean speaking for myself, I disagree strongly with many things this government does. Most of this I am powerless to stop. I am powerless to cut down on our surveillance operation and prevent the potential adult content filter being imposed on ISPs. Should I leave? Should people leave this country for maintaining minority opinions that they have no ability to change?

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"I have a feeling that if implemented, this could leave people with a system that appears even less democratic and hence makes them feel even more disenfrachised than they currently do. Let me explain why.

At the last General Election the turnout was 65%. Let's assume that this is a typical indication of the number of people who have even a slight interest in politics or how the country's run.

Now let's return to your hypothetical constitutency of 70,000 voters. To ""outvote"" the MP, at least half of these 70,000 would need to register online and vote differently from him, because anyone who doesn't vote is essentially yielding control of his vote to the MP.

Let's be generous and assume that your system has encouraged more people to participate in the political process, and that 75% of the consitutency's population vote on a bill. Of those who vote let's assume a one-third/two-thirds split, i.e. 65% vote in favour, 35% vote against. The MP votes against. And now we turn that into numbers:

* MP's votes (AGAINST) = 25% of 70,000 = 17,500
* People's votes (FOR) = 65% of (75% of 70,000) = 34,125
* People's votes (AGAINST) = 35% of (75% of 70,000) = 18,375

In Total this gives us:

* FOR = 34,125
* AGAINST = 35,875

That's a win for the AGAINST group, even though two-thirds of the voters who cared about the issue wanted FOR to win. And that's on a popular turnout of 75% for this vote, remember, which is much higher than I think you'd really find happening.

Once that kind of pattern happens a few times around the country, people will be right back to the current situation of thinking ""voting doesn't change anything, why should I bother"".

1st: Started the role, undeniably important. Character developed from crochety schmuck to fun-loving, explorative grandpa.

2nd: Silly, but as a shroud for massive intellect. Added more humor to the show--played a freakin' recorder whilst thinking!

3rd: Badass suave motherfucker. The James Bond of Doctors--knew ""Venutian Aikido"" and drove a sick yellow buggy.

4th: Was in the role for the longest time, had fantastic scripts and probably the best comedic timing.

5th: If you're looking for a ""nice guy"" Doctor, Davison is your man. Selfless as any, and wears a decorative vegetable. 

6th: Displayed a new dimension of the Doctor, a not-necessarily-nice guy. TV scripts sucked for him, but he has since come alive on the audio plays.

7th: The Chessmaster of Doctors. Very cerebral with a dark wit--likely the most underrated doctor.

8th: 90 minutes ain't much to go on, but his portrayal was lively and debonair, and like 6 is helped tremendously by his great audio works.

9th: Pretty much what you said about ""Dalek."" Survivor's guilt and probably the most genuine dramatic acting.

10th: NOTHING. I'm kidding, I just find him overrated. This doctor is hip, snarky and very emotional. Great companion chemistry.

11th: He's amazing in that he's a happy-go-lucky child on the outside, balancing the oldest and most weary doctor on the inside.

As far as I understand they can only be put in prison for acting on those sexual desires, breaking the law. Child molestors rather than simply paedophiles. The difference legally and morally is that a child cannot give consent for sexual activity, same sex adults can. 

About the only way paedophiles could legally get off on their fetish would be animated, fictional pornography, which wouldn't harm any children. 

Technically I guess you could argue that paedophiles who don't act on their desires in any way (including consuming non-fiction child pornography) are unfairly demonised or whatever. But that's a pretty fine distinction to expect people to be making.

true,Lollypopsoldier,num26,,"You are aware that Real Madrid's most common midfield partner ship last year was Alonso-Khedira with Özil as the no. 10? Khedira is a great box to box and a very good ball winner, whilst Alonso is arguably the most tactically astute player in his position, he is very positionally aware, has an incredible passing range and is a great tackler. Carrick is currently being paired with Fellaini, who is quite the ball winner. If you're going to come up with systems in which Holtby plays the deep lying playmaker then you need to look more closely at similar systems, most deep lying playmakers are partnered with a very good defensive mid, not instead of one. Examples being...

Alonso - Khedira
Modric - Sandro
Carrick - Fellaini
Gerrard - Lucas
Pirlo - Vidal/Pogba
Schweinsteiger - Martinez
Xavi - Buesquets 
Gungodan - Bender

I can't think of many teams, if any that play two playmaking centre mids. I'm not saying you're wrong about Holtby being able to play deep, but if he does, he's playing with Sandro/Capoue or Paulinho will have to take on a very reserved role.

You are going to need to explain that because it makes almost literally no sense to me

&gt; The most stressful part of the day for many is the 1.5hr commute.

There are plenty of people who spend that long commuting ten miles across london on public transport. Public transport doesn't automagically improve commute times. The only way to do that would be to colocate everyone close to their place of work. A stipulation of the brave new world that you envisage is we all live in dorms in our offices like the works at Foxcon.

&gt; It's grossly inefficient 

In more distributed parts of the country (Most of it) it is inefficient to not have a car. The cost of servicing 99% of the population with whatever magic public transport system you are envisaging would be as economically, culturally and environmentally damaging as anything a car can do.

&gt; For the person that has killed a person, which even good drivers do

Cyclists kill people, trains kill people, trousers kill people, alcohol kills people and bacon kills people. What exactly is your point? Driving is part of the same risk management assessment we do in every part of life. 


&gt; It's anti-social in that it not only exists as the only public space for many communities

Are you saying cities should be built like shopping centers? Perhaps we can outsource town planning to Westfield. And what is the alternative to no roads? Smaller roads for people on foot? So you have the same thing with buildings closer together? So you want more dense and more populated cities with less open space? 

I assume this comes at the cost of banning people on push bikes too. People traveling at ~30MPH in such close proximity to pedestrians with little to no way of enforcing safe practices upon them and almost no accountability or implication of liability.


I'm sorry but you are talking gibberish.  Your implication is that we should do nothing. Stop building things. I mean maybe society would be better off if everyone just sat on the middle of the A1 on a beanbag reading Dickens or whatever the fuck you think we should do with roads. But society will want to create things. To create things you need to move from one point to another.

if you read the actual report instead of believing biased news outlets it becomes clear that HMRC haven't nixed anything, it says the govt shoud do away with these things specifically by simplifying the tax law.

so again, the government has taken to selectively reading the parts of the report that fit in with their political agenda, you can't possibly blame the writer of the report for this.

Now, I'm not saying I expect a draw against West Brom, they really are a side we should be beating, but we don't seem to have the best days against them, and I'm saying that it's not the end of the world if it's a draw, because every LFC fan twitter/facebook/social media page seems to go into meltdown if we have draw or have a poor second half. We may still win, but social media only seems to be happy if we batter a side 6-0.

Also, I don't think we should look at the Newcastle draw as losing 2 points in comparison to last season, as we drew with them last season as well. If we beat them at Anfield next time we play them, it'll mean that the points that we got from them didn't change. After 1 game against Newcastle last season, we had 1 point from them.

There are a variety of other names for those targeting older (but still underage) children

Having said that - these vigilantes may have their heart in the right place but they need the intelligence to go with it. By conducted such badly controlled 'stings' they make the job of the police bringing successful prosecutions much harder. In addition to running the risk of falsely targeting innocent people - they make it likely that the guilty will get away with it because of contaminated evidence. 

The final issue is that many of the genuine perverts apparently do not operate alone. One of the things the police would like to do is get to the heart of their support network and shut them down.

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"&gt;I don't think they're being reasonable. Why should people currently in the role of 'firefighter' be allowed to retire at an age earlier than others?

Why is it unreasonable to expect a government to honour the contracts it made us sign?

&gt;As current firefighters become less physically fit, they should retire from that role, and continue as something else.

Which is part of the problem, they are not allowing us to 'retire' from the role should be become less physically fit due to age. We (English and Welsh) firefighters are asking for guarantees that we will not be sacked should we become less physically fit due to age, and potentially losing huge portions of our pension. Firefighters in Scotland have already received this guarantee, which is why they are not going on strike. The government made references to making this guarantee a couple of weeks ago, which is why the strike on the 25th was cancelled. Now they have backtracked, and so the game continues.

Bare in mind that fitness policies in the UK Fire and Rescue services are managed by each bridage and not established by government. Individual brigades set the fitness levels required, and so can change them at any time. Should there come a time when firefighters need to be gotten rid of fast [which is coming] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-24327843) then we want assurances that we cannot just be thrown out the door for failing an arbitrary and potentially unfair fitness test. 

I'm currently 30 and want to be in this job for as long as they will have me (even though they want to close my fire station to save money). Personally I'd love to be in this job until I'm 55, 60, 65, however I'm not silly enough to think that age will not one day catch up with me. I don't want to be sacked when that time comes. I'd want to be able to either retire, or be moved to another role, not be left jobless at 55 with a differed and reduced pension that will not come through until I hit state retirement age, which will probably be 68-70 by that time.

If my fitness declines due to something that is entirely my fault, such as getting fat, and lack of exercise, then I would understand, but due to age?

So as you say so long as they don't act on it they shouldn't be treated as monsters but /u/ParrotofDoom is clearly not suggesting that. What he is saying is that to try is that the comparison /u/evilcleberdog is fundamentally flawed. When homesexuals where prosacuited for engaging in sexual acts those acts were not inherently devoid of consent which is not true in the case of pedhophila.

This means that what /u/evilcleverdog is suggesting is that we'll one day decide that a child can give consent to sex with an adult... because there is no other way in which the sexual desires of paedophiles can be legally or morally permitted in the same way that homesexualty is now. 

Now do I think we should treat paedophilia as something people need help to deal with rather than presuming anyone who does find they are attracted to children will either abuse them or be complicit in abuse by seeking out images? No, I don't, I think it does vastly more harm than good and I believe even when they do our justice system is meant to be in large parts meant to be about rehabilitation.

true,broshay,null,null,"The entire system is a mess. They want you to apply for a job each day, but now you have to be applying through the internet. Complain that the internet isn't free, their answer is to go to a library or go into the jobcentre itself. All fine if you have local access to either of those, but My local job centre is 3 miles away, and it's a £4.60 bus ticket. Thats a massive chunk out of your money gone right there, and the amount they give hasn't kept up with inflation at all. Sure you could walk, but what if your middle aged, or heaven help you, pretty much elderly. I'm sure you would want to trudge for an hour in the cold rain, muddle with a computer for an hour soaked through, and then trudge back, and they insist that you log on every day.

Then you have the work on offer, at my local all that's ever available is catalog distribution (in other words self employed avon rep) which is a mugs game, I don't know of a single person who can make a living wage off of that in this area.

Other options are to take part time work, but that's never worth it in itself. The idea is that if you take part time work, they will pay the difference up to the dole level, but that will not cover any transport costs you may have, plus they will insist on seeing a payslip every four weeks. Again sound in theory, rarely happens in practice. Companies will regularly change their pay times each month to accommodate bank holidays and the like, and that's assuming that they are even regular with their payslips, and I've been in a few jobs where they aren't. 

This will itself lead to sanctions and god help you if you are on a tight budget, you will often find that they have decided that they have 'accidentally' overpaid you and now will cut your benefits to make up the cost, and they themselves arbitrarily decide how much to take from you without any consultation. This often leads to missed bill payments as all of a sudden, where you were expecting to have £70 quid for a week, you suddenly have nothing. Additionally, don't be fooled by the government figures on employment, they will class part time temp as employed, and often that's the only work available as the company has no legal responsibilities towards you if you arent full time. I checked out Tesco's the other day for work, and they had 5 part time jobs going, but not a single full time one.

Then there is your housing costs, the JSA will often not cover the full amount of your rent, (nevermind the bedroom tax) so then you will be left further out of pocket, plus the inevitable argument over council tax. I once worked two part time jobs at the same time, which due to my obligations to each company ultimately led me to having my hours cut by each beacasue of timetable clashes, during that time I very nearly went bankrupt, you will end up worse off.

Add to this the added misery if you are not fortunate to live in a city centre. Almost every job that I can realistically apply for in my area demands that I have my own transport, except I'm far to poor to buy even an old banger of a car, and if I could I'd immediately be crippled by insurance and tax, not that you can even get a runner for under a grand nowadays. (Of course if you are wealthy enough to have a new car you can enjoy cheap as chips tax due to 'emissions' and a lovely MPG rate, or even better yet, have a good credit rating to be able to lease).

This doesn't even include the various licences and qualifications you will need to have to even get shitty work like warehouse operative or security services. Need skilled CnC operaters, you need to have a 360 licence, etc etc, and the icing on the cake of trying to get a CRB (or whatever it's called now) check. Good luck getting one of them for yourself if you have ever been homeless in the last 5 years, or if you have have had to move around so much in the search for work that you are unable to recall any of your previous addresses. Plus the cost.

Unable to satisfy any of those requirements? tough, go apply for that Avon job, they will give it to you, oh yes they will because it's risk free for the company, you will be classed as self employed.

 If you don't, well there's the governments new plan to have us all become slaves, working full time for our dole, and I can assure you there are legions of filthy fat cats rubbing their hands in glee over the prospect of having a worker for free. Why offer a full time job when you can just wait and see. ( not to mention that they 'encourage' people now to write on their CV's that under new laws, we must be willing to work, risk free to the employer, free for a fortnight, and we will only be able to claim for our regular dole money, although with plenty of hoops and stipulations attached I'm sure.

I've studied all of human History in Britain, (was an archeologist and an Historian) and we aren't far from  sliding back  to something that looks very much like the social conditions encountered during the industrial revolution, we are already pretty damned close to Victorian England already, and despite what popular culture and tv history tells you, life then was not good unless you were on top. The irony was that there was more social movement available to the educated back then, but then you needed the money to be educated (sounds familiar, hmmm.) If you can, my advice is to emigrate.

- WBA without Lukaku isn't as strong of a side.
- We faced  WBA away 1st game of the season (wonder goal + penalty), so perhaps this loss can be excused slightly.
- We lost to WBA at home after facing ManU, Arsenal, and ManCity in a month

Things we are all hoping to see:
- Agger play
- Kolo score
- Kolo score again
- Moses play as the #10
- SAS
- A 433 formation, perhaps

What we will see:
- Gerrard playing, again. This is too many games in a row for our captain and we need to consider resting him
- 3 at the back, not including Agger
- 2 goals from SAS
- Lucas back in the starting line up

I predict a favorable score-line, perhaps 2-0 or 3-1, and a dominate performance. However, I would like to see Gerrard rested, Agger playing, and perhaps 2 at the back (if Agger doesn't play).

Earlier this month I had to clear an attic of an infestation. It was apocalyptic but I managed to put a genocidal knockout on their numbers.

I found [this website](http://www.clusterfly.co.uk/site/index.php) which will give you more info. They release a pheromone which attracts more to their spot when a suitable one is found.

The best technique I had was to use a hoover, I had large plastic tonic bottle (this is quite important as the plastic is tougher and more ridged), I tapped it to the end of the hoover and sucked the bastards up. Prior to that I was just using the hover tube which while still effective did take longer.

They are less active at night so easier to get if they are clustering. A handy trick is to switch off the lights  then using a strong tourch shine it at the wall while holding the hoover near by; as they fly into the light spot they get sucked up.

Last stage of this process is burn the motherfucking bag.

There are other handy tricks like making traps. A few things on Amazon too.

I have some gopro footage of me going at them, its pretty ridiculous but There was noway I would have been able to sleep if I haddn't got them.

Even if such a society is a little more dangerous, I have always known that there is a tiny chance that I would die in a politically inspired mass murder (it would have been the IRA when I was younger), and I don't see that as a serious enough threat to me or society in general to give up on the whole idea of being able to hold the government to account and prevent abuses of power.

From: [Pure White and Deadly](http://libgen.org/search.php?req=Pure%2C+White+and+Deadly)

&gt; The non-sugar caloric sweeteners are made from sugars, and are what chemists call ‘polyols’. By the process of chemical reduction – adding hydrogen atoms, for example to fructose, so that one more alcohol group is formed and added to the five already present – sorbitol is produced. Other polyols that can be used include maltitol and xylitol. They all provide, in a given quantity, about the same number of calories as ordinary sugar (sucrose); however, as they are not as sweet, you would tend to use more, and so take in more calories. These caloric sweeteners are therefore of no help in a slimming diet, but sorbitol is sometimes recommended as an alternative to ordinary sugar for diabetics, and xylitol has been used in candy and chewing gum because it does not harm the teeth. A major disadvantage in these polyols is that, unless taken in fairly small quantities, they tend to cause diarrhoea.

&gt; The non-caloric sweeteners have no chemical relationship to the sugars and are very much sweeter, so that only tiny quantities are used. For this reason they are sometimes called ‘intense sweeteners’. They have mostly been discovered accidentally in research laboratories where chemists were synthesizing new chemical substances for quite other purposes. They can be used to assist weight loss through reduced calorie intake; to help sufferers from diseases such as diabetes which affect sugar metabolism; to substitute for sugar in times of shortage, for example during war – or, increasingly, I am glad to say, to help to prevent the sugar-promoted diseases described in this book. The best-known non-caloric sweetener is saccharin, which was discovered in 1879. Its use increased considerably during the sugar shortage of the First World War. Another widely used non-caloric sweetener is cyclamate, discovered in 1937; it is, however, at present not used in the USA or the UK. A new, increasingly popular sweetener is aspartame. Because the non-caloric sweeteners do not have the properties of sucrose in providing bulk, preservative power and so on, they are used almost exclusively as so-called table-top sweeteners, to be added to tea or coffee, or else in the manufacture of low-calorie cold drinks. To a small extent they may also be used in home cooking, in the preparation of some items such as fruit salad. Their lack of bulk, however, rules them out as sugar substitutes in most desserts, confectionery and ice cream.

&gt; From time to time suspicions arise that the alternative sweeteners could be harmful. This happens most often in relation to the non-caloric sweeteners, presumably on the grounds that most have a chemical composition quite different from that of any of the natural sugars, or, indeed, of any naturally occurring substance. The suspicions usually arise from some superficial or incomplete research that does no more than hint at some possible harmful effect detected in, for instance, laboratory rats which have been fed the sweetener. The result is usually great contention and the setting up of a much, more extensive investigation. In these circumstances, tests are often carried out with phenomenally large doses of the sweetener; a recent test with saccharin used quantities that in a human being would require the daily consumption of, for instance, several hundred cans of soft drinks sweetened solely with saccharin. This much saccharin would have the sweetening power of some 5 kg of sugar a day.
&gt; It is worth spending a moment here on the question of the toxicity of substances that accidentally or intentionally may find their way into our food. The most important fact to remember is that there is really no such thing as something being poisonous, or something not being poisonous, just like that. What matters is not only the nature of the substance, but also its quantity. No substance is intrinsically harmless; you can make yourself dangerously ill by taking large quantities of water. No substance is intrinsically harmful; it was fashionable in the early part of this century to give medicines containing arsenic as a tonic, although of course the quantities were very small indeed.
 
&gt;Similarly, if it turns out that cyclamate, or saccharin, or anything else, causes some undesirable effect in daily amounts that are fifty or one hundred times as much as anyone could possibly take – and even then only when taken over a period of ten years or more – it would not be sensible to ban it automatically.",0,1382794475,null,0,false,0,cczzlt1,t3_1p90eh,t1_cczzlt1,t1_cczyobb,null,1428977794,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,gorealm,eng-norfolk,Norfolk County,"&gt; Cars are safe-ish if you totally cleanse people from the streets

Not many streets where I live. But yeah, that's not really an inherent problem with cars. If populated areas were designed to have proper separation of pedestrian zones and roads then it wouldn't be a problem. But of course, that's not gonna happen, so I concede to your point here.

&gt; you have to factor in the driver.

Once computers start driving cars, then you no longer have to factor in the driver. This is a problem of today, but perhaps not one of tomorrow.

&gt;Electric cars even ones self driven couldn't brake fast enough to avoid a cyclist falling off their bike

You're right. Cycling on roads is dangerous. Designated cycle lanes/paths are obviously needed because bikes and cars don't mix. In my opinion, it should not be legal to cycle on a dual carriageway. That's just asking for trouble.

&gt;a kid running out

The main issue here is visibility. These things tend to happen on tight streets with parked cars lining the curbs and pokey terraced houses along side. Now that is something I do have a problem with. Cars should never be parked on the roads. If houses weren't so tightly packed together then every house could have a driveway, or garage. Cars would no longer need to clutter the roads, which are supposed to be for moving traffic. As a country bumpkin I really don't understand how someone can live in an area like that. Cars must indeed be a menace in places like that, but where I live, cars are of no bother to me at all. Cramming large populations into small areas is the main issue, I reckon. Not cars. If I were to find issue with my local area, it would be a lack of footpaths. Then again, walking is not a sensible way of getting around here. Nothing much is within walking distance.

&gt; It would still not solve the problem of bottle necks. 

Self driving cars could potentially be regulated by a central traffic management system that could alleviate much of these problems. Ultimately, it is once again an issue of overly dense population. 

&gt; You'd still need all the abuse in some third world country. Lithium is going to hit a peak like oil.

Sure, but this is likely to be a problem no matter what you do. Can you suggest a sensible way to travel that does not require either fossil fuels, lithium or any other potentially scarce resource?


&gt;RTCs have gone up 2-3 years.

I was looking at the bigger picture. Sure, there are peaks and troughs, but long term there is a clear trend toward reduction.

&gt;Chronic loneliness is becoming a big deal.

No cars would cause people to become more isolated though. Might not be a problem in those highly populated areas where there are many thousands of people within walking distance, but where I live, the vast majority of people are OAPs.

They may not buy into or particularly have time for the current system of politics, but most people can see that within one, maybe two generations the inequality gap in the country has widened, they can see that the state of free healthcare and education has worsened, they can see the cost of living has risen while incomes have stagnated, things that were largely attainable for a lot of people like home ownership have become a pipe dream with house prices hitting 10x annual salary in some parts of the country. That's before we get into any of the benefit stuff that's crippled some of the lowest income families in the country. 

Most people understand that these things don't just happen, they come about because of political decisions, and they intuitively grasp the unfairness of it. Which would be blatant enough without people at the ""top end"" if you want to call it that, awarding themselves pay-rises in the middle of a period of financial austerity and making the contrast even more stark.

In fact I'd go as far to say that in a situation like that where you look at what the remedy is supposed to be - political action within the established system - and see that it's unlikely to be effective, more revolutionary tactics become MORE not less likely.

true,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,"&gt; That being reducing the benefits bill is the primary aim of this organisation, not helping the unemployed find jobs.

Those are two aspects of the same thing; if somebody finds a job, they come off benefits. The _should_ be aiming to reduce the benefits bill _by_ helping the unemployed find jobs. It's one aim.

&gt; I think it's a simplistic view that this is all increased investment in welfare was about.

No, but it was a large part of it. The last government kept increasing handouts and therefore failed to tackle the causes of unemployment and poverty. Once the recession hit, their house of cards came crashing down.

&gt; I don't see that investing in job creation and maintaining a welfare state have to be mutually exclusive concepts

They aren't, in principle. In real life, the available money is limited and money spent on one can't be spent on the other.

&gt; that a minority of welfare recipients who are able to and do live on benefits constitutes a ""culture"". It's a bit of a lofty term.

What you call it isn't really important. There exist a growing minority of mostly young (under 30) people who view the idea of working for a living as optional and are perfectly happy to live solely on government handouts. These people are _not_ entirely to blame for their situation, the aforementioned policies of the last government helped create them; there was little economic benefit to them working, so they didn't.

The players themselves were great in the first half, but our inability to put chances away continues to haunt our league standing.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"For some reason I don't understand, there has been a significant increase in demand in England in the last five years (I and all my friends practise in Scotland) which hasn't been met by an increase in staffing levels.  This results in the constant complaints on here of people never being able to get an appointment.  Scotland seems OK though my GP pals are telling me that the ""quality"" (by that I mean the relevance/clinical appropriateness) of attendances has gone down a lot.  Maybe due to economic factors etc making people need their GP a lot.  The impact of DWP reforms is not to be underestimated either.

General Practice is funded to the tune of 9% of the total NHS budget, yet they are responsible for a huge majority of patient encounters (something exceeding 85% AFAIK).  They do an amazing job but are maligned by politicians and the press, and it is having a real impact on recruitment.  

The reality is that a GP partner has to ""make"" around £350 per hour in order to run a profitable practice after all costs are factored in (salaried GPs are paid by hour by the partners).  This is a complex relationship between capitation (base pay per patient on the books, not much) and QOF (meeting targets, a lot more lucrative but depends on population and their diseases).  Perhaps QOF payments are going down because of the change in patient presentations, I have no idea really.

true,Mardarkin,eng-norfolk,Norwich,"&gt; Those are two aspects of the same thing; if somebody finds a job, they come off benefits. The should be aiming to reduce the benefits bill by helping the unemployed find jobs. It's one aim.

I can't disagree with you that theoretically the one should be bound up in the other.  However, the statistical fudgery that is allowed to go on within governmental departments can confuse things on this front.  Somebody in 'part time employment' counts as 'employed' to the DWP; this can be further reflected in the idea that 'being employed' means 'not requiring benefits' or 'not being on benefits' means you are financially stable, which is obviously not the case.  Nevertheless, fewer people on benefits is a victory for the JSA: more people in jobs is not necessary to achieve the former.

&gt; The last government kept increasing handouts and therefore failed to tackle the causes of unemployment and poverty. Once the recession hit, their house of cards came crashing down.

Doubtless they failed to tackle the causes of unemployment and poverty.  And I certainly won't disagree with you that they failed through their winking insistence that they were improving things.  However, the ""house of cards"" you refer to was surely the ""never-going-to-bust boom"" that a global system mostly failed to recognise as reckless.  In other words, welfare bills aren't the primary cause of our debts: the root is a failure to monitor and regulate banking systems resulting in false confidence.

&gt; In real life, the available money is limited and money spent on one can't be spent on the other.

I debate the reality of this.  Admittedly economics sometimes gets the better of me with its jargon, so I am perfectly willing to admit my error here.  But if quantitative easing, creating money, for banks is a solution to a lack of lending, borrowing and spending money in the economy, I see no reason that supply could not be increased under the right circumstances.  At a fundamental level, I dispute the notion that there isn't enough wealth pocketed away in the world to deal with mitigating some of these larger issues including a decreasing need for physical labour and the inevitable underemployment of millions as technology advances.

&gt; These people are not entirely to blame for their situation, the aforementioned policies of the last government helped create them; there was little economic benefit to them working, so they didn't. In addition, they did not put their time into education, so have little in the way of marketable skills, so even those looking to leave that lifestyle have a hard time doing so.

I would add that nobody but successive prior governments [and perhaps those who voted for them] and the financial institutions they championed are to blame for the lack of incentive to work in this decade or so.  Even for those who want to and choose to work there is a lack of incentive, when wages don't match the cost of living.  You will have to admit that even those who put time into their education as it was conceived in the last 20 years are leaving school and university with difficulties in ""marketability"".  I think this is why some of us have a hard time stomaching the dismantling of welfare mechanisms, when the error, the creation of these conditions, is largely at the door of the opposite, more affluent and influential section of society.",0,1382805297,null,0,false,0,cd02jgb,t3_1p8y9g,t1_cd02jgb,t1_cd019u2,null,1428976413,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Since the last thread I have read:

- Schindler's Ark (Schindler's List was based on it). Frankly it was hard word and he didn't stir up any empathy for the characters in me, not even Schindler (but I found it hard to get over that he initially did it for the money I guess, that and he was a cheating bastard). Usually I love Keneally's work, so I'm at a loss to explain why I didn't love this book. 

- The Shining. I thought I had read this as a teen but now I'm not so sure. Anyway, it's marvellous. I'm not very good at describing books so if I think I can add to this later, I'll come back and edit. However, I watched the Kubrick film just after reading it and it has massively put me off the film. He really did mess Wendy's character up lots and sabotaged most of what the book was about. His descent into madness was not slow in the film at all. Not was he ever shown as the loving father he is in the book. 

- Doctor Sleep. Stephen King took 35 years to write the sequel to the Shining and it is really, really good. I struggled to put it down, staying up til the early hours reading it. It focuses on what happens to Danny, the little boy with special powers. Dan has lost his way and become a drunk, getting himself in humiliating situations much like his father. He leaves town after a particularly bad night and settles into working in a place where people care about other people and want to help him. Then a little girl with the shining comes into his life, and it all gets very messy. 

- I'm 100 or so pages into Dominion by C.J. Samson. I bought it for a discount when I bought Doctor Sleep, but I'm told he's a great author and I should read his other stuff. So far so good, he's a good writer; it feels weird reading about Britain and Germany being in bed together and Churchill leading a revolution though.

Writing in books is cool with me. I like the idea that other people get to read messages between people who are fond of one another. Margins though? No, get out. I don't even do that in my textbooks.

Harry will need to have some words but he has to take some responsibility. The game was not taken to them and by the time the substitutes came (a bit late) one of them was Jenas. I was mortified. What has he done to justify his place *on the bench* this season let alone on the field? Instead he just does his noble gas impression and finds the quickest way to lose possession.

true,yatat,null,null,"I'd like to touch on you using the 500,000 vacancies vs 2.5 million unemployed figures as you're using them in a bad way. The 500,000 vacancies are not static, they get filled, then replaced. Likewise the 2.5m unemployed become employed and get replaced by the newly unemployed.

This is a prioritized queue system, it may take time but eventually everyone gets to the front of the queue (even if it takes some people a long time).

The classic example would be people waiting for an operation. Say there are only 10,000 places in surgery but 500,000 waiting for operations, If you've a minor, none life threatening condition, you go in at the back and move forward as the queue whittles down, if you've a life threatening heart condition and only weeks to live, you get put in right at the front. Eventually everyone in the queue will get to the front important or unimportant.

With jobs it's a bit more complicated as you've skills, experience, interview technique all coming into play. However if you keep at it, and queue properly (aiming for the right jobs, boosting interview techniques etc.) eventually you'll get to the front of the queue (be the best candidate for a job).

2.5 million unemployed vs 500,000 vacancies is actually a fairly meaningless statistic. What is important if how fast those vacancies appear and how fast they are filled compared to the size of the unemployment queue.

There is a fair and rational reason why people need to jump through hoops: it's to ensure the queue can function and that each person does enough to ensure they have enough of a 'priority' in the queue to ensure that they can get to the front eventually. If someone takes no action, they'll have no 'priority' and stay permanently at the back.

It's tricky to explain but I'll try:

You're skills mean you should have a priority of 5, however as you haven't been jobhunting effectively, your priority is 1. You've a queue of 100 people with priority 4 looking for a job. A new job appears once a day. That means it's 100 days until you're front of the queue.

100 people get their job 1 day sooner because of your messed up priority but you get your job 100 days later. Staying unemployed for 1 day less probably has no major effect for those 100 people but staying unemployed for 100 days extra is more likely to have a strong (possibly devastating) effect for you as you can't keep up will bills, your skills deteriorate and your productivity nosedives.

People 'outside' of the queue do also have an effect. It's most noticeable when unemployment is low but it adds to situations where it takes longer than normal to fill a position because it takes longer than it should for the skills to turn up. In low unemployment, this is good for workers as it leads to wage increases, when unemployment is high it could just mean that it takes an extra day to kill some positions which wouldn't affect wages but would have a (slight) impact on productivity.",0,1382812415,null,0,false,0,cd04wug,t3_1p8y9g,t1_cd04wug,t1_cd04ahj,null,1428975306,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; October 25, 2013 5:22 pm Victory for tech giants on EU data laws
 
&gt; By James Fontanella-Khan in Brussels
 
&gt; UK premier David Cameron and German chancellor Angela Merkel at the EU summit in Brussels on Friday  
JO-len we saw the story about Merkel's phone being tapped anu that 35 leaders' phones were also compromised, we thought we were goinl to lose ... Britain's common sense - executive at large US tech
company US tech giants such as Google and Facebook have won a major victory against EU efforts to restrict the sharing of customer data after UK prime minister David Cameron persuaded officials to put off increasing privacy protection by at least a year.
 
&gt; The decision to hold back on adoption of new rules at the peak of a scandal that has seen the US accused of snooping on millions of European citizens and leaders is a huge blow to European ambitions for stricter data protection standards.
The postponement will give US companies — as well as the Obama administration, which has been frantically lobbying for the watering-down of the reforms — the opportunity to make their case more forcefully once the attention shifts away from the US spy scandal, said some EU officials and privacy advocates.
 
&gt; Tech lobbyists were alarmed this week by the European Parliament's decision to amend the EU's draft data privacy legislation to limit the US's ability to spy on EU citizens. The measure had been stripped from the original proposal, made by the European Commission in January 2012, after intense lobbying from US officials.
 
&gt; US companies also want to scrap — or at least lower — sanctions for breaching any new regulations, which could cost companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon heavily. The parliament increased the fines originally proposed by the commission to 5 per cent of annual global revenues or eloom, whichever is greater.
 
&gt; Senior EU officials said Mr Cameron had spearheaded getting the date moved to 2015. ""They don't like the directive as it is,"" said a top Brussels official. ""It is burdensome, they say. They wanted to have a reference to more timely adoption. So the compromise was therefore the reference to 2015.""  
At an EU summit, Mr Cameron initially opposed setting a timetable for new data rules. But agreed to compromise on 2015 after France, Italy and Poland pushed for the proposal to be completed before European elections next spring.
 
&gt; Germany — to the surprise of many of the 28 leaders present at the meeting — did not take sides, said an EU diplomat: ""The Germans have been very ambiguous.""  
Angela Merkel, German chancellor, accused the US of tapping her phone on Wednesday, prompting her to launch a separate initiative with France to renegotiate their intelligence services' co-operation with America.
 
&gt; Britain has echoed the concerns of US tech groups that the legislation would create a conflict between American and European legislation as well as burden companies with unnecessary red-tape during a difficult economic recovery.
 
&gt; ""It looks like we won,"" said an executive at a large US tech company. ""When we saw the story about Merkel's phone being tapped and that 35 leaders' phones were also compromised, we thought we were going to lose ... Britain's common sense prevailed.""
 
&gt; One of David Cameron's aides said on Friday that he had ""no idea"" whether the prime minister had discussed the data protection rules with Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google, who sits on the prime minister's business advisory board.
 
&gt; But he insisted that Google was ""not the reason why"" the prime minister had fought against early adoption of the rules. ""As offered it contains huge extra burdens on businesses so there has to be some changes to it, that is why we got it removed.""
 
&gt; Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, said in the early hours of Friday that several countries had been concerned that a rushed proposal could harm businesses that heavily depended on personal customer data.
 
&gt; ""What is the problem? ... It is a complex task not only related to the already difficult issues of protecting privacy but it also [has] an impact on business, so we have to study this carefully,"" said Mr Van Rompuy.

Online ones usually have a large margin of error or range to their valuation (either explicitly stated or hidden in small print) as they can't take any factors into account that doesn't neatly fit into their forms etc.

Depending on the property type and area a sitting cooperative tenant with a proven track record  can actually add to the ease of sale and sometimes even slightly increase the value (roughly 3-4 months of rental income for the last two I sold with sitting tenants).

Whatever you do broach it with your tenants carefully. Try and convince them you're aiming to sell to another landlord. Unhelpful sitting tenants make a sale near impossible; signs disappear, every slight issue with the house will be highlighted to potential buyers that do view, but far more often sudden illnesses/ unavoidable appointments will occur hours before viewings take place forcing them to be cancelled.

Bradford will be able to point you in the direction of sponsorship opportunities. 

Going abroad to study is a fantastic opportunity, but it is also an expensive one. You need to be sure you're going to the right place.

Unless you're looking to do a very specialist course that only Bradford excels in, I would seriously reconsider going to that Uni. It's one of the [lowest ranked unis in the UK](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/bradford) and, trying to put it delicately, it's not the best place in the country to live.

The Student Room is a site for UK students. Visit the [Bradford Uni forum](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=824) - you'll be able to ask questions to current students.

Long-Range Effects of Child and Adolescent Sexual Experiences Positive Review"", Allie C. Kilpatrick.

&gt;This book will be disturbing to many readers. **The assumption that all children are ""damaged"" by their experiences is challenged by Kilpatrick's finding that 38% of the adult respondents reported the sexual experiences as children to be ""pleasant"" while only 25% reported them to be ""unpleasant.""** Kilpatrick also found that, although the majority of the women stated that the experience was initiated by the partner, for many (23% of the children 0-14 years and 39% of adolescents 15-17 years) the women reported having been the initiator. Another surprising finding was that only 4% of the respondents reported that they would have liked to have had counseling.

In 1999, a peer-reviewed meta-analysis of the effects of childhood sexual experience endorsed by the APA, the largest and most authoritative psychological institution in the country reached the following conclusion:

&gt;""The self-reported effects data contradict the conclusions or implications presented in previous literature reviews that harmful effects stemming from CSA are pervasive and intense in the population of persons with this experience. Baker and Duncan (1985) found that, **although some respondents reported permanent harm stemming from their CSA experiences (4% of males and 13% of females), the overwhelming majority did not (96% of males and 87% of females).** Severe or intense harm would be expected to linger into adulthood, but this did not occur for most respondents in this national sample, according to their self-reports, contradicting the conclusion or implication of intense harm stemming from CSA in the typical case. Meta-analyses of CSA-adjustment relations from the five national studies that reported results of adjustment measures revealed a consistent pattern: SA respondents were less well adjusted than control respondents. Importantly, however, the size of this difference (i.e., effect size) was consistently small in the case of both males and females. The unbiased effect size estimate for males and females combined was ru = .08, which indicates that CSA, assuming that it was responsible for the adjustment difference between SA and control respondents, did not produce intense problems on average.""

&gt;""Many lay persons and professionals believe that child sexual abuse (CSA) causes intense harm, regardless of gender, pervasively in the general population. The authors examined this belief by reviewing 59 studies based on college samples. Meta-analyses revealed that students with CSA were, on average, slightly less well adjusted than controls. However, this poorer adjustment could not be attributed to CSA because family environment (FE) was consistently confounded with CSA, FE explained considerably more adjustment variance than CSA, and CSA-adjustment relations generally became non-significant when studies controlled for FE. Self-reported reactions to and effects from CSA indicated that negative effects were neither pervasive nor typically intense, and that men reacted much less negatively than women. The college data were completely consistent with data from national samples. Basic beliefs about CSA in the general population were not supported.""

In cases without violence, coercion, or intimidation, societal reaction to the sex, not the sex itself, is what causes psychopathology later in life. For example:

&gt;Nelson's relationship marked ""the happiest period of [her] life."" ""When I was a child I experienced an ongoing incestuous relationship that seemed to me to be caring and beneficial in nature. There were love and healthy self-actualization in what I perceived to be a safe environment. Suddenly one day I discerned from playground talk at school that what I was doing might be ""bad"". **Fearing that I might, indeed, be a ""bad"" person, I went to my mother for reassurance. The ensuing traumatic incidents of that day inaugurated a 30-year period of psychological and emotional dysfunction that reduced family communication to mere utilitarian process and established severe limits on my subsequent developmental journey.""** [She was 8 at the time]

&gt;""Regarding iatrogenic sources of harm, Prof Richard Green has written: ""…research suggests that cases leading to official legal action -- rather than being dealt with informally -- produce more severe and lasting ill effects on children."" Green cites several studies, the first American (Walters, 1975): ""Most of the psychological damage, if any, stems not from the abuse but the interpretation of the abuse and the handling of the situation by parents, medical personnel, law enforcement and school officials, and social workers."" An English study (Howard League Working Party, 1985), found: ""The degree of lasting harm suffered by victims… seems to flow predominantly not from the sexual nature of the experience, but rather from other sources of shock associated with it, notably the use of violence or intimidation or the abuse of parental powers. The subsequent intervention of parents, or other authorities, in order to bring the offender to justice often seems to aggravate the damage caused by the offence itself.""

Kilpatrick, A. (1987). ""Childhood sexual experiences: Problems and issues in studying long-range effects,"" The Journal of Sex Research, 23, 173-196. 

&gt;""A related issue with respect to the use of terms like ""consequences"" and ""effects"" is that these terms imply causal relationships between childhood sexual experiences and adult functioning. Such causal inferences are usually inappropriate given the retrospective and/or correlational nature of many of the studies. For example, there have been many reports that the social system's handling of incidents regarding sexual abuse of children caused as much or more harm as the sexual experience itself (Brunold, 1964; De Francis, 1969; Justice &amp; Justice, 1979; Mann &amp; Gaynor, 1980; Schultz, 1973; Summit &amp; Kryso, 1978). Effects or consequences attributed to the sexual experience itself may have actually been caused by the way the experience was handled by the social system, or, for that matter, by any number of other factors.""",0,1382815396,null,0,1382815700,0,cd05vjm,t3_1p7v40,t1_cd05vjm,t1_cczxhe5,null,1428974856,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Sexual activity does not harm children. This is cultural superstition discredited by meticulous scientific research.

Long-Range Effects of Child and Adolescent Sexual Experiences Positive Review"", Allie C. Kilpatrick.

&gt;This book will be disturbing to many readers. The assumption that all children are ""damaged"" by their experiences is challenged by Kilpatrick's finding that 38% of the adult respondents reported the sexual experiences as children to be ""pleasant"" while only 25% reported them to be ""unpleasant."" **Kilpatrick also found that, although the majority of the women stated that the experience was initiated by the partner, for many (23% of the children 0-14 years and 39% of adolescents 15-17 years) the women reported having been the initiator.** Another surprising finding was that only 4% of the respondents reported that they would have liked to have had counseling.

Ford. C. S.. &amp; Beach. F. A. (1951). Patterns of sexual behavior. New York: Harper &amp; Row. 

Is it possible to initiate something, but not consent to that same thing? No it is not- it is logically impossible.

&gt;""As long as the adult members of a society permit them to do so, immature males and females engage in practically every type of sexual behavior found in grown men and women. [p. 197] [...] **After reviewing the cross-species and cross-cultural evidence, we are convinced that tendencies toward sexual behavior before maturity and even before puberty are genetically determined in many primates, including human beings.""**

&gt;""The proportions of men in each of the nine study groups—two groups of child pornography offenders, three groups of offenders against children, three groups of offenders against adults, and one group of general sexology patients [who had no history of charges for child pornography or sexual offenses] —who met a diagnostic criterion for pedophilia used at the Kurt Freund Laboratory (pedophilic index greater than .25; Blanchard et al., 2001) are shown in Figure 1. There was a significant difference between groups in the proportions who met this diagnostic criterion: 61% of child pornography offenders, 35% of offenders with child victims, 13% of offenders with adult victims, and 22% of general sexology patients."" According to the authors, the 35% figure may be inflated because study participants were referred due to clinical or legal concerns about their sexual interests or behavior, and the study included an inordinate number of people who had convictions for both child pornography and child molestation.

&gt;""According to Gebhard et al. (1965), only one-fourth to one-third of the sexual offenders of girls examined were classified as pedophiles, and in about half of those cases ""some degree of socio-sexual deprivation existed at the time of the offense, which may have triggered the behavior [p. 74]."" Gebhard et al. further mention that ""the term 'pedophile' is somewhat unfortunate since these men did not consciously prefer children as sexual partners, but simply found them acceptable [p. 74]."" In other words, to the majority of sexual offenders against children the criminal interference with children was not a coveted goal in itself; rather it served as a poor substitute for a preferred, but unobtainable normal heterosexual experience. A number of other facts about the heterosexual offender of children (discussed by Gebhard et al., 1976) are relevant: [...] his masturbation fantasies are quite average, that is, he does not especially fantasize about children.""

&gt;""Yet even after thorough police and child welfare investigations, some pedophiles are found to have no history of sexual contacts with children. [...] Seto &amp; Eke (2005) followed a sample of child pornography offenders for an average of 2.5 years. The majority of these offenders would likely be diagnosed as pedophiles (Seto et al. 2006). A small proportion (4%) committed a contact sexual offense during this time period. This suggests that having a sexual interest in children is not a sufficient factor to explain sexual offending against children. In Seto &amp; Eke's (2005) study, child pornography offenders with any kind of prior criminal history were more likely to commit a contact sexual offense, or an offense of any kind, during the follow-up period. This finding suggests that it is the pedophiles who are more likely to engage in antisocial or criminal behavior of any kind—which would include individuals who are impulsive, callous, and willing to take risks; individuals who become disinhibited as a result of substance misuse; and individuals who endorse antisocial attitudes and beliefs such as a disregard for social norms or the laws—who pose the greatest risk of acting upon their sexual interest in children (Seto 2008). In contrast, one would predict that pedophiles who are reflective, sensitive to the feelings of others, averse to risk, abstain from alcohol or drug use, and endorse attitudes and beliefs supportive of norms and the laws would be unlikely to commit contact sexual offenses against children.""",0,1382817265,null,0,false,0,cd06hp5,t3_1p7v40,t1_cd06hp5,t1_cd0676e,null,1428974569,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I have been burgled before, and I was there at the time. I understand that it can be a frightening prospect. Personally I didn't let it affect me all that much, my job involves working with offenders so I know the type of people that commit these crimes, and it's generally drug addicts looking to take what they can to pay for their next fix. They have no thought whatsoever for the homeowner in most cases, they're driven purely by addiction.
I walked in on the burglary as it was in progress, and the person fled immediately, as is usually the case. I wouldn't have been prepared to escalate the situation by brandishing a weapon.

I think what this boils down to is a simple disagreement as to what we are willing to give up as two different nations. There's no notion of the right to bear arms in the UK, legislation has been introduced throughout our history to limit their spread, and if guns were legalised tomorrow I really doubt that the percentage of owners would increase to anything like US levels.

true,DividedBy_Zero,null,null,"Worth is all a matter of perspective. A few years ago, a company called MFX made a run of officially BBC-licensed sonic screwdriver replicas for 300 British pounds apiece, but the paint job was flaky, the dimensions were off, and there was no sound at all. Basically, it was a flashlight. You can argue that for such a poor job, it shouldn't go for that price (and I agree), but people bought them anyway.

The thing is that the collectors who seek out CT's replicas want very screen-accurate replicas of props that were in the hands of their respective actors, regardless of features. Both CT and Wand Co have done great jobs, but they both offer something different, and in CT's case, he offers an unparalleled degree of screen accuracy that even Wand Co hasn't been able to match completely. A lot of material engineering went into it as well, so his replicas end up being far more durable than the original props. Once he's done with the 11th Doctor sonic, a user will be able to flick it open without breaking it, which can't be done with the $4000 version.

Wand Co's sonic is a great replica that is close enough to the original prop for most collectors who just want a replica that does the prop more justice than the flimsy toy from Character Options, and its price point makes it less horrific if one were to break it or lose it at a convention, but it's not quite perfect, and many see the worth in going the extra mile to have what CT has produced: a highly-detailed, near-perfect replica of a screen-used prop, and many prop collectors see the worth in having that level of accuracy, whether we're talking about lightsabers, sonic screwdrivers, or the One Ring.",0,1382819158,null,0,1382834431,0,cd073uj,t3_1p520y,t1_cd073uj,t1_ccyvuzj,null,1428974282,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

As a result the Scottish government have no difficulty in banning it. Is the reason for the environment (as stated) or because it is unpopular. You judge.

Contrast that to England where fracking is not only feasible but also an alternative to other dwindling supplies. In this case fracking is being allowed, even though it is unpopular, because the politicians judge (rightly or wrongly) that it is the right thing to do to bolster supplies. 

Don't get me wrong - I don't disagree with the Scottish government decision to ban fracking and I don't think it is wrong to have made a popular decision - but to claim it is because of environmental concerns seems a little misleading.

With the 3 at the back, sometimes the wing backs move forward and Toure/Sakho move wide to create an extra man. But if we played without that extra man it is down to the midfield to run that 5/10% more, which is problematic since they already struggle as it is to play at an intense level for 90 mins (except Hendo).

Also, Coutinho can be brilliant on the ball but this season defenders were much tighter to him and he lost the ball quite frequently. This leaves us so open defensively. At the moment, we have to outscore our opponents because clean sheets don't look possible. That is why so much of our play is focused on getting SAS into the game.

Rodgers probably feels that at this moment in time SAS are playing so well, and are so dangerous together that we can bank on them to hide our inability to control games for 90 minutes. On top of that, it can't be easy choosing 1 of the back 3 to drop. They are all playing well, Skrtel most impressively when funnily enough he'd be the one you would guess would be dropped first.

Signing a new AST will limit the number of potential buyers from everyone to just buy to let investors, but if you're in an investors area the benefits of a cooperative tenant outweigh limiting the size of the pool.

To justify the slight price increase you need to push the savings to the buyer of having a sitting tenant. Key points to cover are not having to pay tenant find fees to an agent, no loss of earning while the property is empty, no liability to pay council tax if the tenant find takes time and no lag in waiting for a housing benefit to be set up (if that's the target tenant). Its worth mentioning that no matter how thorough the pre-tenancy checks there is always a risk of a bad and unreliable tenant.

Reliable sitting tenants are most appealing to small time investors as they are the ones most at risk from a bad tenant. A landlord of many properties can spread the loss from a single bad tenant across their entire portfolio while they get them evicted, whereas someone with only one letting property risks having all their spare income disappearing on a second mortgage or even worse defaulting on their BTL mortgage while dealing with the bad tenant.
