true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"Okay, this is tricky. My advice:

- Look closely at your lease; are you within a period whereby you would be able to give a month's notice?

- Is it possible that you have the same landlord? If it's a multi-property landlord I would explain your concerns to them and ask them if they have any other properties available in the nearby area that you could simply switch to *

-	If you do decide that you absolutely have to report this to the police, please be aware that their reaction could be very hit and miss; I had my door kicked in by a drug addict at 6am one morning and he put a gun to my boyfriend's head. I managed to get him out of the flat (my man was so terrified that he was paralysed with fear, and added to that, stark bollock naked); his girlfriend calmed him down so we had time to grab our things, get dressed and get out of the flat. So, 12 hours later, and they've got diagrams from me of access points and weak spots for my building, they're going to send in an armed squad to get him out, they're taking it very seriously... in the meantime we've gone to my mum's because there's obviously no way I'm going back there with that lunatic downstairs. I get a call on Monday morning saying 'x has asked us to pass on his apologies to you, he's got the CCTV footage from the dole office and he says that the fella who's been cashing his dole cheques is a black man, so it's not your boyfriend (and who the fuck has 12k in dole go missing anyway?! absolute nutjob). Me: 'I beg your pardon... what happened with the armed lot breaking into his flat?' .... 'oh, we decided we'd leave it to cool down a bit and see if he'd come and hand himself in, which he did on Sunday night.' Gobsmacking. So, this drugged up nutjob was able to get cctv footage from someone in the dole office, maybe even knew someone in the police who talked them out of breaking into his flat, and then apologised to us. These people are SCARY. She might not be as connected as this fella, but who knows what her addicts are like. It's simply not a risk I would take.

-	If your lease don’t allow you to give notice and your landlord is being objectionable about you leaving early due to your fears/not having other properties available, then it seems to me that you have no choice than to go the police route. As /r/satanspanties says, there are children involved here too. And that is genuinely concerning when you consider the calibre of people knocking on her door.

-	Do not go to the local council to address noise issues; you’ve already complained to her, she’s going to know it’s you, and if she’s partying with a bunch of addicts til 6am you have NO IDEA what could happen if she receives a warning letter; again, it’s just not a risk I think worth taking

-	Do you have friends or relatives nearby that you could flee to to kip with if it suddenly kicks off at 3am? If so, pre-warn them. Ask them not to turn their mobile phone onto silent when they go to bed, or make sure you have their landline telephone number

-	Before you do any of the above, write a chronology of events as best you can and please call the CAB regarding your legal rights about your lease – luckily my landlady just let me leave but she refused to kick HIM out because he’s the son of her mate!! But it’s important to know whether you can afford to just leave/abandon the premises if things start getting worse

... * this one needs to be approached with caution; they don’t want a drug dealing tenant and may kick her out, if they do that, remember she knows YOU complained about the noise

Good luck. Let us know how you get on. ",0,1366231025,null,0,1366231246,0,c9h8kq2,t3_1ch894,t1_c9h8kq2,t3_1ch894,null,1431522386,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0

That said, during summer, there's absolutely every chance that the £60 odd bottle of whisky turns into bottles of Peroni, or something else adequately fills the need of something cold during the unbearable heat of the Fens.

The party was 90% locals  (Easton IS the lefty scum area after all, remember?) and 85% of Eastonians i've spoken to agree that, if there was an equivalent one-off, happy party in their streets (e.g. a world cup final celebration on a sunday night) they would accept the party going til 2am, as long as there was a good atmosphere and people didn't feel threatened. 

The same rule is generally applied, I have found, in respect to midweek house parties as well - 2am before you would go round and bang on the door. The next day the put-upon neighbours are well pissed off, but as long as the partygoers are suitably apologetic and clean up (which happened on Tuesday),  its not seen as super out-of-order.

The party was not in any way violent or threatening until 40-80 riot police turned up to break it up. The police version of events is that it had been agreed with 'the organisers' the party would end at midnight and they 'repeatedly' asked the partygoers to go home. 

The truth is there were no organisers (at anarchist shindigs, that tends to happen) for the police to threaten, so they threatened the pub owners instead, who had no say in the party apart from being chosen by their locals as the location for the party. The pubs closed when they were ordered to, but the street party refused to budge at midnight. 

Most who were there report never seeing the police, or being aware of any sign that the police were getting restless, until the riot police turned up, and were attacked by some people in the party, who saw their presence as a deliberate provocation. 

When Ferguson came down to talk to Easton residents he found a community more angry at the police than the partygoers.

true,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; It is better than the other systems. PR doesn't make a large percentage of votes effectively non-existent. You could even argue that Belgium is a pro for PR as it prevents a minority government from ruling.

Belgium was without an elected government for some 300 days because a coalition could not be formed. I'm struggling to see how that is a positive. Italy is currently going through a similar thing.

Also the horse-trading that is necessary may frustrate people since what may be a key issue for them voting for a party is disgarded in order to form a coalition. 

To say it is a ""minority"" government is a bit disingenuous since the government will be formed by the party with the most votes. In any multi-party democratic system any single party is most likely going to get less than 50%. 

A FPTP or even AV system allows for a strong government with a clear mandate. Sure this is possible under PR but it is much less likely. 

FPTP and AV do not make votes non-existant. Even in ""safe seats"" a politician must stand against more candidates and if that seat becomes less safe as a result of a vote it is as likely to affect the politics of those standing in future.

Of course, the true hierarchy when it comes to freekick taking might not be as clear as I've made it out to be. If Luiz had not scored would Lampard have taken the freekick that followed? We cannot be sure. What we *do* have is a trend that has Luiz taking *pretty much* all freekicks in dangerous positions whenever he plays - that is something we are sure of.

true,Fyenwyw,welsh,Wales,"&gt;Belgium was without an elected government for some 300 days because a coalition could not be formed. I'm struggling to see how that is a positive. Italy is currently going through a similar thing.

It's better than allowing a government to form which has a minority of votes.

&gt;Also the horse-trading that is necessary may frustrate people since what may be a key issue for them voting for a party is disgarded in order to form a coalition.

It can happen but it can also prevent parties from rolling out unpopular policies.

&gt;To say it is a ""minority"" government is a bit disingenuous since the government will be formed by the party with the most votes. In any multi-party democratic system any single party is most likely going to get less than 50%.

I already pointed the three elections that this country held where the party with the most votes lost.

&gt;A FPTP or even AV system allows for a strong government with a clear mandate. Sure this is possible under PR but it is much less likely.

That's because PR requires the ruling party to actually have a majority rather than say a percentage in the low 40's.

&gt;FPTP and AV do not make votes non-existant. Even in ""safe seats"" a politician must stand against more candidates and if that seat becomes less safe as a result of a vote it is as likely to affect the politics of those standing in future.

They effectively do. Sure there are other parties in the election but they don't have a chance in hell of winning the majority of the time and the opposing parties generally know this. let not also forget the gerry mandering that goes on when each government that comes in changes constituency boundaries to make it easier for them to stay in power.

&gt;Representative democracies suffer from this less than direct democracy systems, not that this is necessarily relevant to the main point :)

If you are concerned that people don't drink here, no need to be alarmed. We have more pubs per person than anywhere else in the UK, and everyone drinks all the time.

Also on that weekend, everyone gets really pissed and is sent around town to do treasure hunts. I ended up swapping my boxers with a complete stranger just because. Are these the kind of drunken adventures you're looking for?

Edit: as for concerning non-drinking socialising, there are roughly 8000 students and 7000 locals, so everyone you meet will be a potential friend.

I think the issue is the same one the Second Doctor faces for a lot of people these days:

There simply isn't enough to go off of.   In the Second Doctor's case, it's because so many of his stories are incomplete or missing.   A lot of people just can't get into him because of that(personally, I LOVE him).

In the 9th Doctor's case it's the fact he was only in one season.   He was a good Doctor, but for a lot of people you just can't learn to ""love"" him because of how short his tenure was.   We only JUST got to set up his personality in that first season, along with rebooting the series, and introducing the idea of the Time War.   All of this means that a lot of his stories were testing the waters on things like how much time-wimeyness the audience will take, and introducing the audience to the New Doctor.   Also, since it was the beginning, it lacked the sense of continuity that later seasons developed.  Yes, we got introduced to Captain Jack, and Rose....but Rose at the time was pretty much just another companion, and Captain Jack was just a fun one-off Character until the very END of the 9th Doctor's tenure.    The Ninth Doctor's time set up the seeds for the Tenth Doctor, who reaped the delicious, delicious continuity time-tomatoes.  

TL; DR is that the Ninth Doctor's only season was an entire season which was spent setting things up.  As a result, Doctors who have gotten a chance to be more fleshed out tend to be vastly more popular.",0,1366241534,null,0,false,0,c9hcmss,t3_1ck6vq,t1_c9hcmss,t3_1ck6vq,null,1431520403,22,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,22

The real problem is the governments commitment to sustaining these communities by continuing to give them benefits.

 Heathcote, the centre of the McIvor diggings in Victoria (Australia), was a mining village of **30,000** diggers in 1852 and it was deserted **a decade** later when it became no longer profitable. They didn't stay there, blaming the government for not uneconomically sustaining the mines or not ""investing"" in their community after their mines were closed. They left to go where the jobs were at. And I bet if this community stopped getting free handouts and work became a matter of survival, so would they... It's what it boils down to. The incentive for these people to better their prospects isn't big enough for them to move and so we still have this dead community **two decades later**, who continues to use a dead politician who hasn't been in power for 20 years as a scapegoat for their predicament.

The interpretation I prescribe to is that all the literature and novelization is canon until directly contradicted by the show.

This is contradicted in the show by the Master's backstory of being half-brainwashed as a child (""The Sound of Drums"" and whatnot) meaning that that the show decided that Gallifreyans grow up like anyone else.

The other bit (hah!) hasn't been quite dealt with in the show (at least the reboot) is the Gallifreyan history rewrite, particularly the portrayal of the Doctor as some sort of reincarnation of ""The Other,"" a leading figure in Gallifrey's past.

The real problem is the governments commitment to sustaining these communities by continuing to give them benefits.

 Heathcote, the centre of the McIvor diggings in Victoria (Australia), was a mining village of **30,000** diggers in 1852 and it was deserted **a decade** later when it became no longer profitable. They didn't stay there, blaming the government for not uneconomically sustaining the mines or not ""investing"" in their community after their mines were closed. They left to where the jobs were at. And I bet if this community stopped getting free handouts and work became a matter of survival, so would they... It's what it boils down to.

A customer and I once shared a joke and he thought we were bonding more than he wanted me to (my jovial attitude apparently jeopardises the sales he makes). He proceeds to try and put me in a headlock but is so short and out of shape he just manages to jump up with his arm around my kneck whilst I stand upright.

He once talked about a 'rugby weekend' with the lads and the tale ends with him pissing in a plant pot, the impression he gave of the size of his manhood would make it more shin splint than human, everyone proceeds to laugh at his expense, he assumes win because we think he has a massive knob....

And in general every hobby any male staff member has had he also partook in: boxing, rugby, body building, rowing to state a few examples. 

Despite the aformentioned he was actually a very anal and soulless human being, it got to the point where he was harassing me so much I was seconds away from punching him in the face due to his relentless bullshit and him attempting to start a fight with me.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;If you look at the developing economies in the world today, the majority of them are economically liberal countries that were once socialist, but embraced free market liberalisation and now actively promote economic liberty.

There are some remarkable survey results from amongst the residents of former eastern bloc countries showing widespread support and nostalgia for ""communism"" despite it now being a heretical view to hold, [for example](http://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2010/05/16/nostalgia-for-communism-in-russia-and-eastern-europe/).  [Even strongly anti-communist research groups like Pew find similar support amongst those who actually experienced ""socialism""/""communism"", with only the young who have known little else supporting capitalism](http://www.pewglobal.org/2009/11/02/end-of-communism-cheered-but-now-with-more-reservations/).  None of this sould be surprising considering how many the transition to neo-liberal capitalism has killed in the eastern bloc, particularly in Russia (when we're discussing the deaths caused by ""communism"" versus capitalism - there are lists online which, perhaps somewhat overzealously, attribute more than a billion deaths to the latter during its history).

I also took up knitting because all my (male) friends were making awesome things (4th Doctor's scarf, anyone?) and I wanted to be able to make my own. It might just be that I have very creative friends, but I don't see sewing as a female-only pursuit.

In fact, it's probably one of the most analytically challenging crafts I've taken up recently. It's difficult to try and take two-dimensional fabric,  and create a three-dimensional form that fits over another three-dimensional figure and not have it look like ass. Folks who have a problem with tailoring are people who have a more difficult time with spacial visualization. I mean you have to be able to do math, understand how changes to the shape will affect the final form, and understand fabric mechanics to be good at it. Just taking an existing pattern and making a shirt isn't that hard, but I know that some people are incapable of following simple directions.

Yeah, I guess only the most manly men can actually pull of sewing. They do make some of the most amazing costumes when they master it, though. http://sithcamaro.com/

But in all seriousness, just because a hobby doesn't fall into your definition of ""manliness"" doesn't mean it's not something that would be useful and/or fun to learn. Building simple birdhouses are great and all, but when's the last time you strode into a costume party wearing a Jedi costume you made from scratch and makes you look like as much of a bad-ass as Samuel L. Jackson? I have a lot of respect for people who have the skills to make something awesome.

Growing up in Australia and living now in the US, this is my first instinct as well. When industry dries up over here, people pick up and go where the work is.

I sometimes think that this could account for the major part of the difference in attitudes towards capitalism in the New World and the Old. In America, people don't necessarily see it as unfair that they should leave where they are and move somewhere else when opportunity or the lack thereof demands it (or at least, most Americans don't see this as a problem). After all, Americans are mostly descended from people who did just that, packing up their lives and families and moving in search of opportunity. Such values are passed down. I felt the same way about Australia. 

In the UK and Europe, where people still live today where their families have for hundreds of years, that view doesn't even compute. For them, historically, the solution to a change in the fortunes of their community was likely to wait in the same place until opportunity came knocking again. So they see it as a stab right in the heart of the community for the government to pull the plug on the primary industry and then fail to put in place any plan for the revival of the economy.

That explains the bitterness felt by many in the UK towards Thatcher, which to my mind makes almost no sense since Reagan/Clinton in the USA and Hawke/Keating/Howard in Australia enacted similar policies and are all quite popular (and certainly rarely hated to the same degree even by their critics).",0,1366258603,null,0,false,0,c9hixfg,t3_1cjafn,t1_c9hixfg,t1_c9hdvtp,null,1431517366,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I'm still unclear on whether the Beast means ""before time"" as in... before the Big Bang (not actually the start of time in the DW universe, unless I'm misunderstanding the concept of ""time""), or ""before time"" as in before anything ever.


The former implies he's a Great Old One, (or whatever they're collectively called?) which makes some sense, if his power of possession over the ood/humans/the base's computers is similar to the Nestene's possession of plastic.  Can't think of any other GReat Old One powers now to compare it to.


For the record, if I'm remembering the quote correctly, the Beast's explaination of what ""before time"" means was ""before light and time and space and matter.  Before the cataclysm.  Before this universe was created.""


From what I've read on the wikis on the past, the pre-universe... universe of the Great Old Ones still had time/space, even allowing the Great Old Ones to escape to one parallel universe which ended after their original.  So then the escape that back to the original universe which has already ended (Big Crunch?) and the Big Bang's already happened.  Two events that couldn't be survived, both avoided.


Now, as far as the Beast goes, he's been imprisoned since ""before time"".  The same prison, I'd imagine, and why would the others bring him with them as a prisoner?  Why not just leave him behind to die? (this also makes me question how the prison/planet/black hole is even set up to contain him, ever since ""before time"", since the pre-universe had different laws of physics but whatever, that's another big issue and this post is already getting long)  So... considering all that, I'd have to assume the Beast was ACTUALLY from before the Great Old Ones even existed.


...


Another option is the Beast is a bloody liar (well, he is, but... more so), possibly wasn't even the actual origin of the devil myths, and was imprisoned early on in the current universe's history on that same planet.

Other funny American entertainers who are conservative: Kelsey Grammer (Frasier); and PJ O'Rourke, the Libertarian journalist/humorist (who is fucking hilarious by the way); Drew Carey, also a Libertarian; and Penn and Teller, who are libertarians and not really comedians.

That isn't a very long list though. And what is more, Norm doesn't really do political stand-up and PJ O'Rourke is more than willing to heap abuse upon the political right. I've never heard of a decent comedian who espoused sincere conservative views in their comedy.

Very conservative people usually aren't very funny in my opinion. They are too easily offended, and take everything so seriously.

Obviously this doesn't tell you about unofficial customs such as how much faster than the speed limit you can go. The answer to that is that unofficially the police will tend to turn a blind eye to (speed limit + 10%) but that's still illegal so if they wanted to pull you for it they could. Typically on a motorway you might get away with up to 80mph (the limit is 70 for cars) but on other roads I'd strongly suggest sticking to the limit. Get caught doing over 100 on a motorway and you're almost guaranteed to lose your licence.

Turning right (or in our case, left) on red is illegal throughout the UK. School buses are not really a thing over here and there are no specific laws governing them. You do however have to stop if a lollipop lady (school crossing patrol) walks into the road in front of you.

He latched onto Amy as a companion almost immanently after meeting her (Where usually it's not until he sees something in a person that he makes them the offer). He had stopped running from the past, but he still had to learn to deal with it, which was making him act up in a very childish manner (Think manic depression, he was dealing with his grief by basically saying fuck it and doing what he wanted). Now though, he's  older, and he spent a good hundred years or so out on his own before his ""Death"" by River, so he's finally come to terms with it. His role as the sole survivor of the time lords is no longer a fresh wound, it's just a fact of his existence.

I don't know much about Atlee, but what I've read recently suggest that he was a supporter of socialism, of helping the poorest in society and this was a suitable send off for such a humble person. They didn't waste precious government resources just to bury some dude.

On the other hand, here we have Thatcher, champion of the rich, destroyer of the poor. She had sold off the national infrastructure ""for the sake of the economy"" while lining her pockets and the pockets of her associates with profits from the privatised monopolies. She was buried as she lived, a hypocrite, using millions in government money while every public service everywhere was being cut to shreds. How fitting.

We should all remember though, that it probably wasn't completely up to Atlee or Thatcher how they were buried. We know that for Thatcher to have this expensive funeral, the prior labour government of Blair and Brown first came up with the plans and gave approval. This plan was then kept by the current government.

true,Helzibah,null,null,"It's sort of hard to answer this question, if you don't know much about our laws, how are we supposed to know enough about yours to know the difference?!

That said, I can remember a couple of things that have come up before, and that probably don't exist in the US:

* lane etiquette and undertaking: in the UK we actually have laws in place surrounding behaviour on roads with multiple lanes.  The left lane (where you enter the road) will be going slowest, and the right lane the fastest.  You should always pass other drivers by overtaking them on the right (closest to the centre of the road); you should never undertake them by driving faster on the outer lanes.
* jaywalking: not strictly a road law, but pedestrians can cross roads wherever they like, so you may need to keep a sharper eye out for that rather than assuming they can only cross at designated crossings.  However, if there's a proper zebra crossing with black and white stripes then you should give way to any pedestrians waiting to cross.
* traffic lights: someone else has already covered the right turn on red thing, I don't know how your amber lights work though.  In the UK we have two types of pedestrian crossing; one type just goes from red to red and amber, and then green when you're allowed to go.  The other kind goes from red to flashing amber instead which means that you can go if there's no-one crossing.
* traffic calming:  we have small roads in the UK, and one of the 'traffic calming' measures that's done (to slow people down and persuade them to take other routes) is to introduce an obstacle on one side of the road.  If this is on your side of the road, you need to slow down and let traffic from the other direction through until it's clear enough for you to get past the obstacle.",0,1366280077,null,0,false,0,c9hn0t3,t3_1ckiaw,t1_c9hn0t3,t3_1ckiaw,null,1431515437,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

I use to live in the area they are talking about, which is Sydney's King's Cross. It's the sort of place you can take your kids during the day and it's no worse than Cambridge city centre on a Friday night. Essentially Australians who haven't been there since the 80s, if at all, complain because they actually believe the bullshite fear-mongering on the news. In fact, if I recall correctly the murder rate in King's Cross is lower than it is in the UK national rate, and this is their 'bad / no go' area, apparently.  It was always funny when Australian asked where I lived in Sydney because more often than not they'd pull a face like I'd been living in abandoned nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, or something to similar effect.

For example, a hospital is banned for charging for meals -- which might be sensible as food is a necessity, but the patient would be paying for food if treated at home, but is banned from buying a decent meal when in hospital.

I later learned that I could have hobbled out to a supermarket and brought something myself to have it heated up, but under no circumstances were the hospital allowed to do the shopping for me (or actually, allow a catering firm in to do it for them).

I proposed a two tier scheme - the current free meals, but also let people buy a supermarket ready meal and have it heated up. Nope, not politically allowed.

But, if I want a cheap instant coffee that is free, but if I want something decent, I can go to to the public canteen and buy one.

The last IRA bombing of a UK city was in 1996.

&gt; One could more accurately say that Americans have a history of being allies of Britain. This alliance stretches back more than a century.

The USA left Britain hung out to dry during WW2 and only offered aid once we'd won the Battle of Britain and it was obvious Germany was not going to defeat us on our own soil. Prior to that the decision was made both by the govt and the people of America that Britain couldn't be saved. We were also made to pay for the help we got in WW2 and have been the only country who have repaid that debt fully. 

Militarily the USA was only interested in the UK from the 50's onward because of their position during the Cold War. It was a perfect place to site early warning radar bases, which were of no use to us at all, and bomber bases to strike back at the USSR.

There are two types of people in the world people who spread information. Then people who bitch about the way others are spreading information. You are part of the problem I am part of the solution. 

**Serous answers to some real chart issues.**

There is no way to do that. People are just going to have to read.

To address the ""unnecessary 3d"" it's like boobs I just like to look at them. Both look better in 3d. To those people who want to complain there are too many graphs. There is not such thing as too much information or too many boobs and variety is the spice of life. I want to look at both in as many ways as possible to better understand them.

Can't have that with out completely destroying the chart. 

The ones that are too flat are because the spending stays about the same the spending is flat the chart is flat it is what it is. Yes some of the flat things are hidden from sight in some of the charts but they are flat so it's no matter.

I changed a lot of things to try and make it more clear. But at the end of the day I made it as clear as it can be. 
The reason there are more then one graph is to give people different ways to interpret the same information. 

Some are meant to be more visual then data orientated if people want the data they are going to have to read it.

Thatcher knew what she was doing would bring poverty to large swathes of the country but had no solution or even a slight remediation besides the fact that the free market will make everything OK.

Your experiences do not reflect the circumstances of everyone.

Th Government paying for retraining comes into it because the mines were state owned, run and closed. It doesn't just have the normal obligations of a business looking to downsize one arm of its structure. Especially when those employees are likely to go on welfare as a result of the restructuring.

true,BuddhistJihad,null,null,"People have a strong connection to their homes, and that's understandable. There's a lot of history and beauty in a lot of small communities, and not everyone wants to live in a city as well.

You see, you have whole families who know each other, whole towns where everyone knows everyone else's name and are polite when they see each other in the street. People say ""Good morning!"" to strangers.

Everyone's connected by the mine, or the factory, by living and working together. The people work together, drink together, they form a choir together, they go to church together, even often not believing, but just for the ""social event"".

When the economy dies in places like this, everyone splits, the youth flee or slip into destructive behaviour and that whole world is lost. The mines close and the old men stop singing, save for at a funeral for another old friend who had an ""accident"".

Sure, perhaps most people still say ""Good morning!"", but nothing more. Those who can will drive miles away for work. Those who can't will move out, and half the village will be empty houses, perhaps some will be bought by rich Londoners who turn up 3 weeks in the year, you glimpse them getting into their spotless Land Rover once and they look at the locals like they're some terrifying band of devils.

My home village had a capacity of about 500, I think, I only ever saw about 50 people at most, and knew maybe 20 of them. The rest were just... dark houses. Dark, lifeless and empty.

So, once I was older I did as many have done before and went out into the city to find work. I'm surrounded by so many people that sometimes it's overwhelming and a little scary (I could see the entire population of my village in one street, and I'd never heard of a 'mugger' before) yet at the same time I've never felt so isolated.

I mean, don't get me wrong, the countryside was no postcard utopia straight out of Ann Widdecombe's dreams; sometimes having everyone know each other could be extremely oppressive as everyone knew everyone's business and were incredibly judgmental; the families could easily feud; people were exceedingly socially conservative in outlook - homophobia and racism were commonplace, religion and its delightful companions prejudice and suppression of dissenting opinion were rife. 
Very little nightlife to speak of.

However, people in general were still generally more pleasant to each other in day-to-day life, overall. The community, the shared history and the *closeness* had many benefits. Your friends are old, very old, and you have a bond even with people you fight with (though, when you're kids stuck that close together you'll all fight at some point).

Even the kids who did go wild, riding their bikes around and beating up other kids they stumbled across, engaging in petty crime, aren't as threatening as those in the city - most you'll get is a few bruises and your grandmothers hectoring you and tutting at each other, not a knife through the ribs.

There's a whole argument to be had about the systemic reasons (i.e. related to the law and government) that these communities cannot be self-sustaining as it is, not to mention social and economic ones, but my argument here is that I can completely understand why people would not want to give up their communities to try to chase the winds of the market.

You ever try finding work while sick with an unpredictable illness?

Part time jobs require regularity just as much as full time ones do, and lot of illness isn't regular.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;The fact that going up and down the country on the East coast is relatively cheap and straightforward, but if I want to go across the country it's much more expensive and time consuming. Many of the roads (especially Northumberland/Scottish borders) are in dire need of repair and expansion. HS2 is good but it needs further expansion.

The roads I cycle on in London are horrifically poorly maintained, not fit for the amount of traffic, and so pot holed I get through about 16 inner tubes a year (I don't believe in trying to avoid them if its not completely safe for me to do so!).  Yet despite all that, its doing OK.

HS2 is a massive waste of money I think.  People aren't scrambling to have fast access to Birmingham or Manchester (which will require phase2!).  I just don't see something going for 90 min to 70 min resulting in massive regeneration.  Infact considering the inflation busting price rises we've seen on most of the rail network, investing in un-glamorous efficiency measures will be a better bet, make it cheaper for people to use.

&gt;There are industries that with the right backing could expand 

Then why aren't they!  If you look at the most successful employers in the UK, then look at the ones that have made the biggest cutbacks to staff.  The ones that do well generally never require any state funding.  The ones that do badly require it by the bucket load.  The problem is that isn't sustainable.  If someone thinks that £200M will mean a healthy growing business, with minimal risk of investment, its quite easy to raise that money, rates are low at the moment and investors are constantly seeking new areas to place their money in.

If on the other hand it's very risky, might never work, you ask the government!  You mention that its 12,000 jobs on the line and before you know it rover gets more money, it worked really well for them.

When you put a pin on a map in an area of high poverty, it is generally an area that relied heavily on one industry, more often than not, the area was reliant on a government subsidised one.  When you put a pin on a map and hit a really successful area, it is seldom a place that ever received government subsidies.

It is a chicken and egg problem, it has no simple solution.  Or do you try what Ireland did, and have a very low corporation tax to attract investment, effectively people want to expand there because it's *cheaper*?

First off, in no way am I saying that just because you can't see the disabling issue, it doesn't mean that it isn't disabling. 

I'm trying not to make this argument shadow everyone who currently claim disability allowance, I hate painting a whole body of people with the same brush.

I'm talking about this guy, who's attitude is disgraceful. Enjoy the football match. Enjoy the friendly rivalry, but where does he think that it's acceptable to partake in a violent riot - especially if he's been on disability 'because of his lungs'. I'm no doctor, nor do I have any further information as to what the specifics of his condition is, but surely the increased stress on the respiratory system that rioting entails is something that he should be very concerned about and would only aggravate his condition further. Seems like such a needless risk.

I suffer from migraines. When I have one, I can't see, I can't speak coherently, among other things and when I have a serious attack, I most certainly can't do anything productive. 
The point I am trying to make here, is that I do everything I can not to provoke a migraine from occurring. Whether than means not eating the foods I enjoy or having to bail out of activities with my friends/family.
Selfishly, it's because I really don't want to suffer the pain of it, but additionally, it's because I don't want to have to take a day off work. It's embarrassing for me to admit that I'm not fit to work.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I think it's worth picking up on the consensus point, in the Cameron quote. Thatcher said this in 1981:

&gt; To me consensus seems to be —the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and policies in search of something in which no-one believes, but to which no-one objects. —the process of avoiding the very issues that have to be solved, merely because you cannot get agreement on the way ahead. 

Thatcher and Clegg are opposites, not because of their views — Thatcher and Clegg would agree on some points, disagree elsewhere — but because of their political styles. Clegg stands for political parties attempting to reach consensus in the national good, Thatcher stands for strong ideological leadership. 

In Germany, Merkel's centre-right CDU party is currently discussing the possibility of forming coalitions with any of the other three major parties, the left-wing Greens, the centre-left SPD, or staying with the liberal FDP. The last centre-left government, run by Schroeder, [introduced the Hartz reforms, which are essentially welfare cuts to 'incentivize work'](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/01/germany-hartz-reforms-inequality), similar to what the coalition is pursuing now. They did that, despite being a left or centre-left party, because there was a consensus among the parties that this was a problem that needed solving*. 

Equally, Germany has unions who try to reach consensus with management - when Germany went through the 2008 recession, companies didn't lay off workers, they made agreements with unions to have temporarily reduced working hours. That meant that when demand recovered, the companies could return quickly to full output.

Clegg stands for this continental style of politics, Thatcher for the Anglo-American style, of polarization between parties, and clearly drawn ideological battlelines.

*Edit: I should say, I don't intend this as 'the left must face reality', or anything like that, the point might just as well be framed the other way. For instance, the centre-right party accepts/supports legislation which means there is worker representation on company boards.

I largely agree, I mean the guy's obviously a fuckwit, and he deserves whatever punishment he gets for punching the animal - that said there's been plenty of attacks in this thread not based on the fact that the guy's a fuckwit but essentially based on the fact that people think no-one with a disability should be allowed to go to the football on a good day if they're able. It's horrific, it's as if people think that anyone on disability benefit should *never* be allowed to have fun because any sign that you have quality of life above ""I want to die"" is taken as a clear indication that the person is completely and utterly faking it.

&gt;but surely the increased stress on the respiratory system that rioting entails is something that he should be very concerned about and would only aggravate his condition further. Seems like such a needless risk.

I can't speak for this man's particular case, but sometimes when you're ill in the long term you do things you know will make you suffer for hours or days afterwards, simply because they make life worth living and it's sometimes better to have ups and downs than it is to just have pain and mediocrity all the time (I speak from personal experience there).

I appreciate that you get migraines and having lived with a migraine sufferer for several years I understand the crippling effect they have. That said, migraines for the most part aren't there, so yes you do your utmost to avoid them but overall most people who get them can still have a relatively normal life. It can be different for people whose illness maybe makes 10/14 days of their life completely and utterly shitty, because sometimes I think they are more prepared to do something which is going to fuck them up a bit for a few days just because...well you have to have something in life, y'know? Otherwise what's the point?

edit: Also don't take that as a belittling of migraines, I know how crippling and awful they are, and I'm deeply glad I don't get them myself having spent so much time tending to someone who does and seeing the immense pain they were in, but still, most people in my experience get maybe a max of 3-4 a month, not 26 or 27 bad days a month.

So you need to think of limitations first, there are definitely possible schemes although some of them would be feats of organisation and engineering. You can't have anything time sensitive, you can't really have anything where a person is doing a job which someone else can't do, you can't have any positions where a person is being relied on.

So for instance shop or office worker is pretty much out because if a shop has to hire enough people that it doesn't matter if you *don't* show up, then you're not required and it's a job the shop won't want to have because it wastes their money. Same for most office positions.

Where possibilities do come in is in stuff like non-time sensitive data analysis. If you've got a battery of maybe 100,000 people who can do basic data processing when they feel up to it, get paid for the work they do (because obviously many disabled people will work less efficiently than the non-disabled and you have to be realistic in accounting for that) - then you have a single system where companies can input data to be processed in the knowledge that even if only 5% of that workforce are working that day, that's a group of 5000 people who can be sat at a PC in their home working away at analysis and problems.

It wouldn't have to be complicated work, even just creating spreadsheets, formatting documents, there's a huge number of fairly basic but time consuming tasks which have to be done every day.

That's something which could be viable, but it'd need to be run by the government, run well, be enough of an incentive to the disabled that they'd actually do it, and be attractive enough to companies that they'd actually use it.",0,1366297035,null,0,false,0,c9hqeo7,t3_1clhwx,t1_c9hqeo7,t1_c9hq2gh,null,1431513770,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think what you've suggested sounds reasonable, call center work is also another where often they just need another person on the phones to keep the queue down, so it doesn't matter too much if someone fades in or out of there, plus there's a lot of weird checks and shit that they still need to do in banks/mortgages that are also time consuming but not time dependent (often spotting the mistakes of the computer and the like), I guess some of these could be done from home if they implemented the correct security measures on people's data. 
Hell, if you've got someone who knows their shit about literature then send them the slush pile to work through. 

Obviously all the sorting out of who could do what job and where etc would take a lot of time and would have to be done on a case by case basis, assessing skills and whatnot.

&gt;and be attractive enough to companies that they'd actually use it.

The point being that *any* of the political parties - I wouldn't mind if they dissolve tomorrow. They choose to stand for power or not - and what they stand for - and what they fight for. 

When it comes right down to it - the question on everyone's lips will be something along the lines of ""who will fight for *me*?"" or - hopefully - ""who will fight for the wishes of the majority of the population?"". That's why the AV system would be such a welcome change. 

Getting back to the Lib-Dems though, the fact remains that they gained popularity on the principles of what they stood for and said they would do - then they didn't stand for that. It's not my concern to be *nice* to any one political party - they didn't fight for their pledges and they no doubt gained support as a result of things they didn't pull through on.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;It's almost like you believe London doesn't take government subsidy.
It doesn't take a subsidy, it produces revenues in excess of what is spent.  However that is often due to headquarters and the like.

What I am saying is subsidising industry doesn't help, and London isn't some land of perfect infrastructure.

&gt;The London Underground and bus system receives 7.7 billion a year, with only 3.5 billion in revenue.

Wrong.  TFL receives 7.7B.  TFL includes everything from certain roads, traffic lights, cycle lanes, its quite a long list. 

Now when you consider that 15M people live in the london metropolitan area from the last census, this works out to be about £500 per head.  Those using the tube will pay anything from [£1200-3000](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14416.aspx) for their travel card, more if they can't afford an annual fee, those using the bus pay £1.20 per trip.  These are, depending on who you compare to very expensive or average.  Compared to world capitals its not heavily subsidised.

What annoys me however is the tube unions vs modernisation, I don't understand why when the RMT strike, they don't leave the barriers open, rather than shut down London.  This means we've got working practices which are in-efficient, tube lines ready to be automated, but the unions won't allow (other nations do it perfectly safely!).

So in fact I'd be quite happy for modernisation of TFL!

&gt;Throw that kind of money into transport in the North and see what happens.

Okay, so we're looking at a £500 per head subsidy, remember this is for key road and cycling projects too.  What effect do you think that would have?  It's hard to find any figures, as even Manchester doesn't have a central transport authority.

Those using the bus pay £1.20 per trip. In Leeds and most other northern cities that's £2.80 a trip. Thanks to poor infrastructure in Leeds a 4 mile public transport journey in rush hour takes 50 minutes. That would be unimaginable  in London.  Manchester and Leeds Metro services would love the power of TFL to control fares and service quality, but the government won't allow it, thanks to excessive lobbying by Arriva and First.

If you're moving from one ADSL provider to another, you should be able to obtain a MAC (migration authorization code).

DO NOT just cancel your existing service and then buy another. This will almost guarantee downtime.

However, the above is your only option if you cannot be provided with a MAC. With some providers providing a MAC cannot be done (not sure about Be) because of the way the system works. If you're unlucky, you've been ""removed from the BT network"" and you'll just have to cancel and order with a new provider without a MAC. However, if you're lucky:

Basically, you'll have a Be ""tag"" on your line. After the final day of your Be service, this can take up to a week to expire. It can be instant, but it can take time to be removed from your line. This means that no other companies (legally) can touch your line until the tag expires (meaning BT wouldn't be able to provision service on the line).

If you have a MAC, it allows you to migrate your line seamlessly (or near enough seamlessly).

Call Be and ask if they can provide you with a MAC code. When you ask for a MAC, you're not cancelling your service and you must be provided with the code within 5 working days of requesting it (by law). You call your new provider (in this case, BT) and provide them with the MAC. When BT use the MAC, that initiates the actual cancellation with Be. You can request a MAC, not use it and your service should continue as normal with the original provider.

A week+ down the line, your service will switch without any major interruption.

The biggest service interruptions, when switching ADSL providers, occurs when you cancel with your old provider and order with a new one. The new provider absolutely cannot touch the line while the tag exists, and this can exist well after your service is actually cut off. This means the new provider will need to wait weeks (sometimes over a month if there's a fault with the tag removal) before being able to provision your new service. It's not their fault. It's BT's (they manage the tag system). However, having a MAC allows the new provider to legally transfer responsibility of the line services easily.

Reply to this if you have any questions.

PS. Someone else may be able to clue us in as to whether you can obtain a MAC with Be.

So we get back to my question, what would it be spent on?  It sounds like the people who've been voting at a local election level have been electing the wrong kind of lizard if they have a duopoly with no central vision.
&gt;In Leeds and most other northern cities that's £2.80 a trip.

Wrong.... Again. http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/leeds/tickets/simple_fare/
Its 10p cheaper in Leeds than in London.

I would also suggest looking at a bus time table for London before decreeing that 4miles wouldn't take an hour.  It frequently does in parts, even at the quieter times.  Granted we have the tube, but a lot of people are priced out of that.

&gt;How about we make London break even on tube fares, and spend the billion quid it loses each year on building monorails or undergrounds in other cities?

Well some of those subsidies are for social mobility, kids get free travel to get to school/college and for some reason OAPs get free travel.

Because a £1B would do nothing for a monorail or underground, they are incredibly expensive.

If you read my other post as well you'll see I'm massively in favour of modernising the tube, but there is a reason by Bob Crow earns more than the director of TFL.

So yeah, I'm in favour of not spunking so much on the tube.

That said, this would be a lot easier for households with two working parents, and help keep kids out of trouble in the hours between school and dinner. It's also potentially a progressive move for social equality - there's a lot of evidence (and common sense) which suggests [home conditions](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100520213116.htm) are largely responsible for children's' educational achievement - more school hours would help level that playing field.

In a similar vein, one of the major differences between private schools and state schools is that the former frequently have longer days, compulsory (or heavily encouraged) after school activities and so on - longer hours would allow state schools to provide similar contact time. There are also very legitimate points concerning the international competitiveness of our work force - a lot of the inequality in society stems from those who can compete for high end, international jobs and those stuck in local consumer services.

However, the most crucial element to any change along these lines IMO is that there should be a corresponding increase in funding. I really wish there was a party *properly* pushing education - I don't think it can be understated how important it is to invest in our future society.

true,argon-donkey,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"His idea that British education needs to compete with the extraordinarily high standards and pressure of East Asian countries (i.e. China) is flawed. Extrapolating a form of education from a culture and system of governance almost diametrically opposed to our own is bound to fail. The education system in those countries is designed to make children into functioning workers, not free-thinking individuals. Across all forms of research, the assumption that a 'working' mass-method from one area will produce the same results in another has repeatedly been shown to be a failure. We should be focussing on innovation, imagination and creativity - something which Mr Gove seems to want to abolish. For example, in Scandinavian countries, they have shorter days, shorter weeks, little inspection and minimal examination. Mr Gove appears to understand the education system as a businessman would - something that must be profitable. But education is there to equip people with the skills to reach their own aspirations, and not the narrow Tory view of an aspiration. 

Besides, how are children meant to achieve their aspirations, when those in state education are automatically disadvantaged against those in private education? The much better-connected private system allows students to access opportunities, such as work placements, that are uttely inaccesible to state-educated pupils (outlined in a recent report by the Sutton Trust). Also, higher education is increasingly becoming prohibitively expensive, especially in the area of Maintenance Loans. So what are these aspirations? How does Mr Gove expect equality of opportunity when the government he is a part of of seems to further restrict social mobility and personal happiness? Fundamentally, his education reforms are purely idealogical, with little or no understanding of the actual needs of children and teachers.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; So we get back to my question, what would it be spent on? It sounds like the people who've been voting at a local election level have been electing the wrong kind of lizard if they have a duopoly with no central vision.

Transport. As I pointed out, local election politicians want TFL style control over transport. Central government won't allow it.

&gt; Wrong.... Again. http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/leeds/tickets/simple_fare/ Its 10p cheaper in Leeds than in London.

Do fuck off. I live in Leeds.  The short hop fare is for 4 stops. Which equates to less than a 1 mile journey. It's £2.80 for everyone wanting to travel to the city centre.

&gt; Well some of those subsidies are for social mobility, kids get free travel to get to school/college and for some reason OAPs get free travel.

And London being a massively rich super capital could afford to absorb those costs into its transport fares.  You claim London doesn't need subsidy remember?

&gt;Because a £1B would do nothing for a monorail or underground, they are incredibly expensive.

A billion quid a year would reopen or create around 50 new train stations in Leeds or Manchester, reducing commute times both on and off the road.  [An example](http://www.wymetro.com/news/projects/projectdetails/kirkstallforgerail/) - £17m would open an extra station in Leeds.

That's a one off cost. Unmanned stations are cheap to maintain. 

&gt; Give me some time and I'll try to put together the transport subsidy for Leeds, how much you want to bet its more than £500 per head.

Good luck if it's like your shit googling skills ""herp derp I found a £1.1 fare for Leeds lolz"", you're going to be up all bloody night and you will still get the facts wrong.

The Lib-Dems don't like Trident, but they agreed to it as part of the coalition, in return for the AV referendum. I personally don't think Clegg made the best bargain he could have, but this was agreed as part of a cooperation between parties.

true,argon-donkey,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I understand where you're coming from.

However, you mentioned a few things I'd like to question. You mentioned the evidence for home conditions affecting children's learning. But an alternative could be that, by allowing more time for children at home, whilst simulataneously encouraging grassroots and community-based education programmes (libraries, community centres, reading initiatives), the domestic learning environment could be drastically improved. I imagine that it would take the burden off of the state in the long run, as people become more educated, and other incentives in parallel could seek to improve wider social and domestic conditions.

I think there is also a siginificant difference between contact time and improved educational resources. As you rightly said, 'the most crucial change...is that there be a corresponding increase in funding'. However, as I've discussed in another comment, private schools have much better connections and more financial clout to allow their students to access high-end jobs in the long run. No amount of increased lesson time will improve educational standards and/or mobility without proper funding. Which, with things how they are, isn't exactly likely (or indeed feasible).

true,Fineus,null,null,"&gt; When I started looking at jobs afterwards they all want demonstrable experience of software development or admin type skills like configuring servers, Active Directory, Citrix and a whole host of things I've never touched on.

Not to rain on your parade, but..

* Is it unreasonable for them to expect you to be able to demonstrate you can develop software at a basic level (and I'm assuming that's all they wanted)

* If you're being questioned on infrastructure and support type skills such as Citrix / AD / Exchange etc. then you're probably in the wrong interview - or looking at the wrong job. Software development and IT support very rarely mix their skills and even at a graduate level I don't think Computer Science is the degree for that. 

If you graduated in 2008, it's too late for you to keep applying for roles as if nothing went wrong. Any recruiter will want to know why you didn't get in any sooner and wonder what the issue is (I'm sorry, but it's true). 

Your task now therefore should be to work out what you really want to be doing (application development / web development / IT support / etc.) and even go so far as to work out what languages you want to be using (If it's web, do you want to specialize in PHP? If application development... C#/ASP.net or Java? etc.)  

Then get yourself onto a training course or even another degree that will hone your skills in these areas. Alternatively do online courses and create portfolio material that shows you can definitely grasp the basics of whatever it is you're being asked to do. 

*Then* get back out there. 

It sucks, but 2008 was a shitty year for graduates. Those in my year either lucked out or took unrelated work (as you did) or went freelance / made their own work. The market is changed though and graduate developers are very valuable but you *have* to prove you know what you're doing.

I think we do need differing game plans, and I think we do. Our set up was very different at arsenal and Reading, for example. you can have plans B through F without one of them being ""Lump it up to the big man"" which as Walsh says is one of the easiest things to defend particuarly in the premier league.

I agree we need to be better at ""plan A"" but also the players need to have more trust in it. almost without fail we look good in the first few minutes of the match, then it's a matter of time until we either get the first goal or we start to lose patience and try to force it.

Some of this I think is down to Gerrard and Suarez. They're our best players and they're both the sort of strong character who will want to take responsibility on themselves to get the game won. However sometimes this can lead to loss of coherence as a team as Suarez constantly trying to dribble past players and losing possession (West Ham) or Gerrard trying to be everywhere on the pitch and leaving midfield wide open (Southampton). Some of their best performances this season have been when they've simply been cogs in the machine (Wigan and Spurs recently).

That said I think we stuck to it pretty well on saturday, bar a ten minute spell in the second half. We kept creating chances, so many of them, great chances too.

Look at the way they passed the reforms through which nearly every single medical board and body condemned, there was protests but at large the general public didnt really care that much.  There wont be a big ""THIS DOES AWAY WITH ALL FREE HEALTHCARE"" type bill that does it away in one go, it will become commonplace to pay for things and people wont mind paying a little higher every couple of years for a service. It will be done in dribs and draps, over a number of years, much like the reforms to paying student fees. 

The tories wouldn't mind another shot at re-election i guess but they are going to campaign solely on labours incompetence and fearmongering since they have achieved fuck all in regards to almost everything, neither of those things have anything to do with their reforms really so they are free to change it up as they like. I think you underestimate how many will enjoy the benefits they have reaped being in power dismantling and changing the rules in order to financially benefit nevertheless and their friends.

The leaf was just as abstract as the weeping angels, but dealt with residual psycho-emathic energy rather than potential time energy. The latter deals with the actual progression of time while the former is based around the deep emotions that create memories. The leaf represents all of the emotions and memories that she would have had with her mother, had her mother not already died. There is no way of knowing what adventures they might have been, and so the possibilities are endless. 

In a brief summation 
The angels feed of a single, known possibility of time
the old one feeds off memories and emotions, and ended up feeding off of a infinite possible memories (all of the dreams Clara has of journeys she could have had with her mother)

But this is Doctor Who, so lets make things a little more wibbly.

Instead of dying in 2005 by ______(whatever killed Clara's mother, I am pretty sure she died to the mannequins but it has not been canonically confirmed) Clara's mother gets touched by an Angel and is sent back in time to die. Everything else is still the same, how her parents met, the book of places to see, ect.

The angel feeds of the potential years that Clara's mother has already lived (but should have lived in the present) and the Angel is happy. It smiles smugly having finished feeding. Now motherless, Clara is left where we met her. She has a leaf, a leaf that represents the fated meeting of two people that would one ay result in the birth of Clara. Clara looks at the leaf and thinks of her mother, who suddenly went missing one day. As she looks at the leaf she thinks of all the journeys her mother said that they would have, and now never would. Seeing the Pyramids at Giza, Visiting the Taj Mahal, even visiting Big Ben. Though these are not actual memories of things that happened, they have the same emotional strength as memories, and that is what the old god feeds off of.

If you are Leeds based, I would recommend focusing your efforts on trying to put the view that a good transport infrastructure, which is multi-mode, is a tremendous asset to the long term growth of the city.

&gt;Do fuck off. I live in Leeds. The short hop fare is for 4 stops. Which equates to less than a 1 mile journey. It's £2.80 for everyone wanting to travel to the city centre.

Calm down, I'm been more civil than your last post.  If we're comparing the cheapest fare (which my bad, has expired, its now £1.40), its only *fare* to compare it to the cheapest one in Leeds.  Some bus routes charge more in London too, and god forbid you need to pay cash, that will be £1 extra.

The problem is Leeds isn't as condensed as London in population density.  London has roughly twenty times the population of Leeds and almost double the density.  If you weight those things, the *its £2.80 for everyone* thing becomes really rather good value.  I know that in 2006 we subsidised buses in Cornwall more heavily than in London, when weighted by population.

Yes London is great that I can get a bus home at 4am in the morning, to within a 3 min walk to my flat, all for £1.40.  But that isn't just due to the subsidies, its due to the fact that bus, at 4am, will be absolutely packed until it's past Camden.  I've had a 10 mile standing room only night bus before at 3am... they are every 20 min on a Friday night.

This is why I am in favour of transport links like Cross Rail, they will reduce the time it takes for people to get to work every day, the per journy cost will be very little.  However the pork barralleing with the east London extension is shameful, and the fact we've still not tied Euston/KingsX/Waterloo bizzare.  That isn't a subsidy, that is an infrastructure project which would pay for itself handsomely over 30 years.

&gt;And London being a massively rich super capital could afford to absorb those costs into its transport fares. You claim London doesn't need subsidy remember?

It isn't, London doesn't get back what it pays in to the national coffers remember.  I am not opposed to what is literally social mobility, just saying that it shouldn't be ""zmog London gets a subsidy"", its London uses general tax money to fund travel for students and the less able.  Not sure why OAPs need it thou....

&gt;A billion quid a year would reopen or create around 50 new train stations in Leeds or Manchester, reducing commute times both on and off the road. An example - £17m would open an extra station in Leeds.

Right, spending it on modernisation scheme.  It's not a monorail, its not an underground, its using the tracks we've already got!  It looks like the development of the station will be money well spent, my only concern is the [planning document](http://www.wyita.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B89F086A-2FA1-4DAF-B8D5-1DD0A761B86B/0/EB29JULY2011ITEM10.pdf) lacks passenger projections.  This isn't field of dreams, you can't go spending £17m on a station which doesn't get hundreds a day, afterall the interest alone is probably going to be a couple of hundred, each day.  (assuming current 30Y gilt rates).

However if we are going to support infrastructure projects, you have to look at how many tube stations are being refurbished, a lot of the subsidy was spent on the east London regeneration project.  Mostly useless pork barrel or vanity stuff mind.

You keep make it sound as if I think that the way the tube is run is a good thing, that I am in favour of supporting its inefficient practices I don't.  I cycle when possible!

&gt;Good luck if it's like your shit googling skills ""herp derp I found a £1.1 fare for Leeds lolz"", you're going to be up all bloody night and you will still get the facts wrong.
Full disclosure, I know the executive team at Yorkshire Metro. So when you do crawl back, I will spank you with the real data.

Brilliant, I'll wait for you to post them, I am sure lots of people would be interested to see the differences, especially when weighted by population and trips made.

As someone who is living in London, it's kind of tiring that people think the tube is this magical thing thats perfectly reliable, doesn't take 40 min to do 10 miles costing £6.40, with roads paved with gold.  My council tax on a tiny flat is £1,800.  Congestion charge is extortionate unless you buy an eco car (I bought one because it was cheaper than paying the charge when lugging specialist kit around that's far too valuable to be on a bicycle).  I would love to see a massive shakeup, switch entirely to oysters (I manage in foreign cities I don't speak the language to use their tokens/rfids) get rid of most of the staff, I trust a LADAR array over the tube drivers any day, whilst having a modern engineering maintaince plan.

At the end of the day all the spending in London are less than it puts in to the economy.  It isn't *net subsidised* playing a game of lets drag everyone down to equality by unfairly penalising London, more so than it already is (my parents in Cornwall get a much higher per head transport subsidy) I don't think is the solution.

This is why the Cycle Hire scheme in London only works in Zone 1-2 and also why they have doubled the fees to try and get it back in the black!  It's a bit chicken and egg, you can't build a mass transit system without the userbase, its hard to get the userbase without it.  Do we agree that London commute times are more expensive and longer than those for people in Leeds on average (mean or median)?  Which creates the tricky problem, shouldn't more investment be possible in London?

true,Alogos,null,null,"Okay... Look. I get the whole ""no one would care if you sounded American because you are""  thing. I never meant to imply that I felt as if I would be mocked or ridiculed for being the American in the room, as it were. I just don't like the idea of it being my defining feature. Or, perhaps, that if I could ""wing it"" well enough, I could avoid the annoyance of the ""so, where are you from?"" questions. I know they can get on people's nerves, as I am guilty of asking due to the same curiosity that I was hoping to avoid. (Slightly related: I love people from London, as they always answer with ""London."" People from elsewhere will say, perhaps, England... Or, in the case of the one Welsh woman I encountered, ""the UK."")

Also, I don't *really* know how good my accent is. Quite frankly, it has its faults, and I understand that. Vowel sounds are a constant struggle, for example. However, the question I had posed was more about why everyone seemed to assume that it was *bad*, as if everyone thinks I'd sound like, I dunno... Austin Powers or sommat. Whether or not it is currently passable isn't really an issue, though... But it is *practiced*, and not just some random ""Oh, I'm going to put on a British accent for kicks!"" thing. It is also, for the record, practiced enough (I talk to myself *a lot*... As I said, helps with my writing.) that, in my humble opinion, I could use it without it sounding forced, unless, of course, the entire reason it would sound forced is because I *am* American. This, then, brings back the question of whether this would always be the case, whether I picked up one naturally or not, which brings in it's own set of issues.

Also, even if I were inclined to acquiesce to your request of proof, I've not really got the means to do so. I access the internet exclusively on my mobile.

As for my usage of the language, it is what it is. I am, however, aware that the way I use English is queer, so I have enough consciousness to mimic ""normal"" speech when interacting with my peers, especially those I don't know very well. (Those who do know me tend to have to deal with it more frequently, though... It was a sore spot between my ex and I, and it had nothing to do with the country of origin of the words but rather how I was using them to express myself.) Also, which ""terms mentioned"" are you referring to? I only remember listing common words when I was responding to the particular reply dealing with my usage of British vocabulary and spelling.

As for the accusation of Anglophilia... I've used the term for myself several times in this thread, but I do so with hesitation. Always. The reason for this is because, in terms of the actual definition, I am *not* actually an Anglophile. I do not view the UK through ""rose tinted glasses."" The extent of my Anglophilia tends to lie in my love of certain British television, such as Doctor Who or Sherlock, as well as, perhaps, an interest in tea culture and my fascination with the various accents and dialects held within that relatively small island you all inhabit. I don't see Britain as a Holy Grail, I know it isn't perfect. Stepping off a plane at Heathrow isn't going to magically transformation me into some London fairy of joy and sparkles. (Though perhaps cynicism and darkles I could see...)

Nor do I need it to. I apparently have given the impression that I am wholly unhappy with myself as a person... Though I think it's a bit of a leap for anyone to assume this based on the fact that I don't like my accent. As it is, I'm perfectly content with myself as an individual, odd as I am, and I don't *actually* care what others think of me. I have various reasons for wanting to move to England, the greatest of which is simply that I really want to get out of America and Canada is too close. None of the reasons, though, have anything to do with my levels of self esteem.

Nor do they have anything to do with me wanting to become ""insta-Brit."" I'm not British. I might be one day, but that's only via gaining citizenship and not by birthright: I'd still be an import.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Britain's first public museum, the Ashmolean, is well worth a visit. I'm not the kind who can spend hours up hours looking at ancient art and taking it all in, but the atmosphere there alone is worth going for. I think there are nearly 40 galleries at present and it's pretty wonderful to be able to amble about and admire chinese landscapes, egyptian sculpture, moghul artwork and the like. 

Then there's the History of Science museum. There are some really cool artifacts - Einstein's blackboard, some horror movie-esque alchemy kits I really like - but it's not going to keep you entertained for a whole day. It's kinda small and most of the stuff, while historic and intricate, is much of a muchness once you've seen a couple (think rooms filled with microscopes).

The Natural History Museum and Pitt Rivers museum of anthropology share a building and are definitely a worthwhile visit. The front, the natural history bit, has all the classic dinosaur bones, insects, caveman skeletons, but the real winner for me is the Pitt Rivers. A door at the back of the natural history hall leads you into a giant dimly lit atrium of 3 floors of amazing interesting artifacts. Samurai armour, a scale model of a chinese castle with a giant buddha inside I've always been a fan of, a ton of pretty guns, and, most famously, the shrunken heads. 

There's the museum of modern art too which I'm not so familiar with. Otherwise, Oxford is just great to explore. The best thing is all the above options are completely free! You can pay to visit some colleges and climb church towers, and I think although it's not advertised heavily you can even pay to go to the top floor of the Sheldonian Theatre (an amazing building itself, you won't miss it!). Then there's tours of the Bodleian library (have never done it!)  and walking tours of Oxford that will take you inside some of the prettier and grander colleges.

true,manosdelmuerto,river,River,"TIME TO MAKE UP A BULLSHIT EXPLANATION 

The difference here is the difference between that which captures that image of an angel and that which holds the image of an angel. Both the Camera and the video camera can capture the image of an angel, but only the video camera can 'hold' it

A picture is worth a thousand words, but that does no mean that a picture speaks all of them. There is a picture of the angel that we have seen and assumed people have looked at without any adverse affect. Where as Amy had a terrifying run in with a video recording of an angel that led to it entering her eyes and taking over

So what is it that makes the two so different that one can be harmless while the other is almost certainly fatal. 

Let's start with the picture. When I take a picture of anything, I take a single moment of life and freeze it. That single millisecond will always be there on the picture, but it will only ever be that single millisecond. 

And now we shift over to a video camera. When I take a video of something I take several seconds of time and record it. Those seconds are captured forever and can be relived. There within lies the difference between capturing an image of an angel (which both can do) and holding an image of an angel (which only one can do)

The moment in the picture is frozen in time, it will never change. It has no actual life. The video camera has a few seconds of angel activity, and since time elapses for the video camera, time elapses for the angel inside the video. The angle has not just been captured but has been held (forced to relive several seconds over the rest of time.)

For most creatures this is insignificant, but for weeping angels this is very important. They are creatures of the abstract who feed off potential time, mostly the time lived by a person who is already dead. We have seen that they can be made from humans, and we also have no idea what they lok like when they are not stone. For all we know they have no physical form until they are stone. That does not matter, what does matter is the old myth that cameras steal a persons soul. We know that this it not true, but pictures and camera's do capture the persons essence along with an image. We can often tell more than just what a person looks like by looking at a picture/recording of them.

The essence of an angel is not a pretty one, it is a malicious being whose life resolves around whether or not they are observed. A picture of an angel has all that is an angel minus, perhaps, the most important thing to an angel, the passing of time. We know that weeping angels can be stone indefinitely, as long as they are constantly observed. A picture of a weeping angel could be alive, it could even live forever, but it can't actually act because no time has passed relative to the angel.
A video recording is different in that time does pass in relation to the image of the angel, it might only be three seconds, it could even be a single second, but the fact remains that time is passing and that means that the angel is not 'stuck' merely 'held.'

I guess what I want to say is people should be aware of what they are getting into with CS and software. It is in the person's interest to have at least some software experience and to know exactly what will be required of them - it is closer to an art than a science and it didn't suit most people on the course, including me. Software Engineering would be a better bet but a college course will be quicker and likely make you more employable for that first job, and once you're in with demonstrable experience the education doesn't matter too much.

They might be shit because their exchange management software is lowering your line speed to compensate for ""line issues"". They may have overzealous compensation settings.

Basically, a lot of exchange management software will reduce your line speed to improve your signal to noise ratio. If you're getting an intermittent connection, it may do it in an attempt to stabilize the line.

Let me put it this way... Your wiring, in your house, which you're responsible for, could be causing a sudden SNR drop on your line, which the exchange recognizes as a potential hazard to the connection on the line. In an attempt to maintain a connection (instead of losing it altogether), it reduces your speed until it's satisfied with the stability.

In theory, your house could be causing your line speed drop.

Also in theory, the shitty exchange software should bump you back up after this happens. They may have it configured so that it doesn't bump you back up so that you're forced to ring up. Hopefully you'd then be passed through to 2nd / 3rd line or whatever until you reach someone with access to the exchange software to configure your connection for max speed / stability.

It depends on how they run their shit. Keep in mind, not every speed slowdown is some employee sat there having a giggle at your misfortune as he clicks a big flashing ""REDUCE SPEED"" button on his computer.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"It's true that you can't blindly transpose systems between cultures - however, that doesn't mean there is nothing to be gained from looking at what different cultures do well. Further, I think the belief that Chinese, and to a lesser extent Asian, education systems don't teach students to 'truly think' is based on stereotype rather than any real evidence. There are plenty of entrepreneurs in China, and their society is developing economically and socially far faster than any Western country. I've personally met graduate students who went through the Chinese education system, and they don't show any of the symptoms you speak of.

I also don't really understand why you equate less school with more 'creativity'. Just as you note Chinese culture is very different, there's [a strong argument](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8574735.stm) that Scandinavian schooling benefits from a more stable family life, and stronger traditions of reading at home etc. Our society is not, frankly, too hot on those qualities right now - hence a large amount of our education problem, teenage pregnancy problem, drink problem, rising social inequality, more (involuntary) single parents - and reducing school hours would not magically fix it. Saying that education should help children achieve whatever they want is a bit of a vacant statement - children are a product of their influences, and want to achieve what is seen as desirable. Today, that's often being a footballer/singer/model/celebrity rather than pursuing intellectual or ethical goals. I really don't see anything wrong about an education system that encourages students to take an interest in rewarding subjects. There's an overwhelming number of commercial influences on children - surely education's role is to shape that towards what we think will benefit society?

Your second paragraph seems quite beside the point. It's true that there are social inequalities that would not be addressed by this problem. However, this policy would see state school students receiving more teaching and (hopefully) a more positive influence from their education, in line with private schools. You can't look at every proposal and rubbish it because it doesn't completely solve everything. It's extremely difficult to properly remedy many of the issues you mention - business links are often built by alumni or based on the school's academic results and the government can't legislate that away. Higher education is something that needs to be made more accessible, but that's a separate (albeit overlapping) issue form secondary education - and one that would benefit from better state school education. His proposals are, as in any government, ideological - however that doesn't mean we should reject them if they would be objectively beneficial.

I do concede that more research on the costs/benefits, and more funding, are needed before this can be implemented. However at the end of the day, I think most children, and especially the worse off, will benefit from more school - far more so than any 'creativity' boost from fewer hours - and there's a real possibility of substantial positive effects. Everything else is really beside the point IMO. ",0,1366316798,null,0,1366319836,0,c9hy5p6,t3_1cm2sx,t1_c9hy5p6,t1_c9hte9i,null,1431510047,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;  by allowing more time for children at home, whilst simulataneously encouraging grassroots and community-based education programmes (libraries, community centres, reading initiatives), the domestic learning environment could be drastically improved.

There is certainly something to be gained from those schemes. However, their key distinction from school is that they're optional, which will be fine for well parented, middle class children but likely of next to no benefit to those from worse backgrounds. In school, supervised reading time, for example, would likely be of greater benefit: we already have the infrastructure, personnel and books in place, so why not use them?

&gt;  I imagine that it would take the burden off of the state in the long run, as people become more educated, and other incentives in parallel could seek to improve wider social and domestic conditions.

In the very long run it would absolutely be excellent if families could take the full burden of parenting - unfortunately, they don't currently seem to be doing that and I'd rather not see children's prospects go to waste while we wait for those gradual social changes to occur.

&gt; However, as I've discussed in another comment, private schools have much better connections and more financial clout to allow their students to access high-end jobs in the long run. No amount of increased lesson time will improve educational standards and/or mobility without proper funding

It's true that these connections etc would also help. However, that doesn't mean that we should ignore means of improving student's purely academic prospects. Even without meaningful funding, more hours can have benefits - supervised homework, for example, can give failing students with stressful home lives a chance to work properly and ask questions, instead of walking away with an F. Likewise, much could be gained from (for example) allowing teachers to give extra lessons on a subject of their personal interest or speciality, and requiring that each pupil attend at least one a week.

&gt; Fundamentally, as sensible as some of his reforms may appear, one must remember that they are at core driven by a right-wing idealogy, rather than being guided by proper research and understanding

As I said in reply to your other comment, I don't think being ideologically driven makes something necessarily wrong - it just means it isn't necessarily right. In this instance, I think there could be real benefits to greater hours, although I do wish we could have a government with a more research driven agenda.",0,1366317393,null,0,false,0,c9hyekd,t3_1cm2sx,t1_c9hyekd,t1_c9htuv8,null,1431509931,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

So, Charles called a Parliament. However, as many in Parliament didn't like him, they did sweeping reforms to both increase their power (after the Personal Rule, where they weren't called for something like 11 years) and decrease the Kings. The Triennial Act stated that Parliament must be called at least once every 3 years, and stand for at least 60 days. If the King didn't call them, they could call themselves. 

This was the basis for the modern system we have today really, as it gave Parliament a lot more power. No longer did they have to hold their grievances until the King needed a bit of money, they were guarenteed to get heard once every 3 years, which, seeing that James I (1603-25) only called 4 Parliaments, with one only lasting 3 weeks, during his reign, was a major accomplisment.

**I might spoil a couple of Shyamalan films for you**

I think my main problem is the Mary-Sue nature of The Doctor. He isn't writing The Doctor for the fans: He's writing The Doctor for himself... But that's just my opinion.

One thing I've noticed is that he doesn't seem to know how to properly foreshadow. The entire over-arching plot concerning Amelia Pond and the plastic just seemed tacked on. If we take a look at the idea of a reveal or a plot twist, they often go one of two ways: First, they are sometimes *too* predictable. The audience finds out what is happening, but it isn't exciting because it was so heavily hinted at. Now, the second way can be likened to The Sixth Sense - the plot reveal wasn't too obvious. I'm sure plenty of people saw it coming, but in order for them to do so, they'd have to really be paying attention. This is how a reveal *should* be. There are hints toward the reveal. Subtle hints that allow the audience to deduce the direction that the story is taking without having the twist thrown in their faces.

Now, let's take Moffat's work... It's comparable to Shyamalan's The Village. The twist, that the village council was pretending it was the 1700's when it was actually modern day, was silly. There was no hint toward the fact that it took place in modern times. The entire film is a period piece until the girl stumbles outside of the reserve. This is the route that Moffat takes. He lacks subtlety and finesse. It's as though he just decides last minute, ""Oh, this thing from the first episode of the season is actually important now, 12 episodes later"". There's no foreshadowing or build-up.

He also introduces random threads that he fails to wrap up. Why did the TARDIS blow up? What the hell is happening with The Silence? Speaking of, he's really giving *his* own creations quite a bit of screen time. It's as if the Angels replaced the Daleks... I digress.

Another issue of mine his the way he handles companions. First, he is making everything *too* angsty. The Doctor is some kind of sex symbol now, for some god awful reason. There's too much sexual tension between him and his companions. Stemming from that, the character development is just *lazy* and cheap (See: Rings of Akhaten). It seems as though he's trying to trick the audience into liking the companions.

Then there's the fact that Moffat uses the TARDIS and the sonic screwdriver as magic problem-fixing devices. The whole wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey thing was fun the first time, but Moffat decided that it would be okay to have the Doctor solve a majority of his problems by jumping around through time while being absolutely silly.

Personally, I've only watched the episodes as they come (series 6 and after). I don't have the drive to watch them after. Doctor Who has just become that thing I watch out of habit.

What made the 1 to 5 so good was the fact that there was a constant change of either doctor/companion which was always made it fun to watch. With the whole Williams comapanion thing, it made it quite stale as the best part about the companion was watching their eyes being opened to new things.

Also a majority of the story lines in the latter of the series have been incredibly darker than the former seasons which has made it hard to make light hearted fun out of and also way too complex which have made the conclusions rushed. 

Matt Smith is a great doctor as shown in season 5, but in season 6 and seven he hasn't really had the chance to show off this doctors goofier side rather having to focus on the protection of the companions.

I don't mind the increase in production values, as long as they don't impact on the tone of the show, which ultimately they have. Much darker and dingy have the environments have become. Even the amount of outside shots have significantly reduced.

Fun Fact: Gin and Tonic was a combination devised by the Company servants. Indian tonic water containing quinine was developed as an anti-malarial agent.

They have looked at the levels of success of various regional development policies which have been pursued over the last 15 years. Unfortunately IIRC they didn't find much effect. I think, to a certain extent, you have to bear in mind that a very high density town/village that is built around a coal mine in the middle of the countryside in Cumbria or the Welsh Valleys might simply not be an environment which is suitable for economic development in an economy where there are less of these very high density, industrial employers. Although industrial jobs will remain, a lot of the economic growth, and growth in employment, is going to be in the knowledge economy. And an economic sector which relies on high levels of knowledge exchange between workers needs those workers to be near each other, not in the middle of moorland, two hours drive from a major city.

Or years of enduring systematic discrimination on the basis of their accent or the colour of their skin. Or seeing their community being torn apart by things entirely beyond their control.

...Or, as with the UK Youth Parliament, because they're obsequious twits who've made Tony Blair their hero and role model.

I don't think it is.

I think we are really shy of a decently brutal satire show and I think our mainstream programming is manipulative.

Aside from that, I think some of the content made and broadcast on telly in the uk is fantastic. Wonders of life was beautiful, the ecstasy trials on channel4 were groundbreaking, not to mention C4s phenomenal coverage of Syria...When other voices are incredibly quiet....

Speedtest is unreliable. It frequently gives me 50Mb/s speeds while I download torrents at 12+MB/s (obviously not at the same time, I might add). It's great for some people, it has just never given me 100% accurate results.

Many apparently. The fix date was pushed back month after month. The first fix date was somewhere around November 2011. I know what the fault was, it was over utilisation, they had too many people subscribed in the area for the network to handle, so it fucked up during peak times especially.

&gt;Have you involved OFCOM and reported how many times you've attempted to have the service fixed?

Contacted the ISPA three or four times, each time we got given a months credit. The final time they gave us about four or five months credit and said we could cancel any time we wanted (which we couldn't because it would cost crazy amounts to switch to BT, plus I could only get 2mbps).

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"I think longer school days are a good idea - my school had much longer days (and longer holidays) as well as Saturday school. However the extra time wasn't spent teaching. It was spent doing sport and other worthwhile activities. I think this is important - more so than trying to add lots of extra teaching hours. 

Another issue is how this will be funded. It's easy for a public school to have longer days, but state schools are stretched thin as it is and I doubt they could afford to implement this right now. 

Education reform needs to start tackling the real issues. Changing the structure of the exams does nothing in real terms - the content stays almost exactly the same, perhaps with some of the education minister's favourite bits added in more prominently. The standards stay the same too. For all this talk of making exams harder, it *doesn't happen*. Look what happened the last time exam results fell - no government or exam board wants to risk that rage. 

Here are some things that could be done to tackle real issues:

* Produce super-high quality teaching materials for the whole curriculum. Some teachers are incompetent or just don't give a shit, and we don't seem to have enough money to fix that. Those teachers need to be able to run a decent lesson - just provide all the ideas and resources they need. 
* Encourage healthy competition. Success is largely about wanting to beat the pants off everybody else. Find ways to create competition that isn't just the abusive kind on sports day every year. 
* Teach useful things - money management, critical thinking, politics - to everyone. An A-level in critical thinking? That's bloody pointless. Knowing some of the tenets of critical thinking and skepticism? Vital to success. Everyone hates 'PSHE', which is similar to this, so endeavour not to make these subjects shit and boring and patronising. 
* Experiment with technology (competently). Individualised teaching looks extremely promising and opens up possibilities that simply haven't existed before as they have been unaffordable. 
* Investigate the possibility of streaming pupils by ability, not by age. Many people lose interest if they cannot keep up. Once they don't care about or hate a subject, you will never fix it. In the same vein, find ways to keep people interested in core subjects. The number of people who simply have no ability to conceptualisework basic maths, for example, is shocking. This is probably because they didn't understand something, found it boring as a result and then stopped caring - after all, it's not cool to understand maths. No child is thinking that before they start primary school - it's what the current system breeds into them. 

I don't have all the answers, but nobody else seems to be suggesting any. Successive governments just change exam syllabi and rebuild schools with fancier buildings. Teachers' unions just complain about how much they work. It's obvious that the existing approach will go nowhere.

No it's not.

The flag changed to represent the country it was part of (The Kingdom of England, The Kingdom of Great Britain and the The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). 

Fun fact, the reason for the white and red stripes is to represent Scotland (white) and England (red), that is because while the company was formed in England (hence the English flag), it was given a monopoly to trade in certain areas by the King of England and the King of Scotland (who were the same person).

The reason it was used in USA was because the East India Trading Company had a stong presence there originally. Keep in mind the first successful colony from the England was the West Indies (hence why the natives of America are called Indians).

My cousin (who is a certifiable idiot) was actually called up for drinking a beer while driving. He was under the limit, so he claimed he should be able to drink a beer. The police saw and got him under driving without due care and attention (he got some points and fine), I was in the car at the time, he was driving the correct distance from the car in front, within the speed limit and in a straight line on the inside lane of a motorway, there was *nothing* wrong with his driving. Fact is, in terms of the attention he was paying to driving it was the same as if he had been drinking a can of coke. But basically he was taking the piss so he was stopped.

Also, you can still be stopped for using hands free phone kits or a hands free radio tuner thingy, or if you're dealing with a naughty child in the back seat, or paying too much attention to your GPS, or having a too involved conversation with a passenger. 

Everyone is breaking the law, all the time, if you're not driving with two hands on the wheel, not talking to anyone and looking only at the road you could be stopped.

So yes drinking a bottle is illegal but so is virtually everything else.

Driving without due care and attention is defined as 

&gt;""allowing your standard of driving to fall below that of a prudent motorist"".

There is no legal definition of 'a prudent motorist', put it this way, if you're talking to your hands free radio and you are involved in a road accident your insurance company will have already given up hope of defending your actions, you might as well have been drinking a beer.",0,1366326699,null,0,false,0,c9i27to,t3_1cmdis,t1_c9i27to,t1_c9i0ena,null,1431508134,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,AlabastyrGlyttr,null,null,"My problems with the show as it stands currently are:
1. The Doctor relies too heavily on the Sonic Screwdriver, which seems to be able to do anything and everything. Making it impossible for a foe to be a significant threat or a challenge, when in the original series the Doctor had to use his wits, creating more tension.

2. The Show keeps creating new alien races and throwing them away, instead of recycling established monsters which would have served the purpose fine, why not make your shape shifters the Zygons? Why the Ood and not the Sensorites? The Minotaur in ""The God Complex"" is a cousin of the Nimon. Well... Why not use the Nimon? The Daleks, at first we were dissapointed that they weren't going to be in the new series, but then we got them anyway and now we can't get rid of the bloody things. The Weeping Angels, brilliant at first but the constant retconning of their nature, has led to major plot holes. Can't kill a Stone? When I think if you put the Weeping Angels against Judge Dredd, all he would have to do is set his gun to HI-EX and blow the shit out of them.

3. The situations have a tendency to be contrived. I can suspend my disbelief like everyone else, but then it gets to the point where you're taking the piss. For example The Minotaur in ""The God Complex"" feeds off Faith, now how is that supposed to work, especially since Faith is only a concept of society, it's like in movies where everything is solved by the power of love. And ""The Rings Of Akhaten."" The temple works with psychic connections? sounds legit.

4. The Doctor is the Deus Ex Machina in his own bloody show. Originally The Doctor was as clueless as everyone else, and through that we were able to explore each new world and establish the situation and his intellect allowed him to solve the problem, now he instantly knows his enemies their weaknesses. And the dystopia that you've lived in all your life is gone in a flash, making for a short and forgettable story.

5. No attention to continuity. Now I know a tv series can't get it right all the time. But then it gets ridiculous. ""Fathers Day"" firmly established and made the point, that touching your younger self created a paradox unleashing the Reapers. Flash Forward to ""A Christmas Carol"" and Kazran Sardik touches his younger self without so much as an eye twitch.
Also some episodes leave off with a set up that is never explored, The Satan Pit, for example leaves the door open to a Day of Chaos style story arc, but that's never going to happen. Also what about the scenes that don't need to be there. Like the Doctor in the monastary, which ultimately served no purpose whatsoever.

6. Bloody Gimmicks. The fact that the writers and creators feel the need to focus on stupid gimmicks like ""Fish Fingers and Custard."" instead of telling you know... an actual story. it's insulting to your audience as if they have no ability to pay attention, and creating these fake fandoms constantly going on about ""Fish Fingers and Custard"" no one with a brain bloody cares.

I was by no means suggesting that I thought my view was *the only way* to correct everything wrong, I just wanted to point out what I saw as faults in Gove's suggestions. I agree that aspirations are not formed in isolation, and that it is part of a wider socio-cultural attitude. What particularly worries me, and something I may not have made clear, is the 'one size fits all' approach. Education should be tailored (obviously within certain set standards), rather than an enforced catch-all approach. You mention 'what we think will benefit society', but there is inherently a value judgement in such a statement, in the same way I made a judgement in 'education is there to equip people with the skills to reach their own aspirations'. Who makes the part of the curriculum that tells students what is beneficial to society? Perhaps, in governing education, it is a moral imperative to not impose any ideology on what is being taught, if one professes to be a fair and democratically-elected representative. But I digress.

My second paragraph is beside the point, and I think I acknowledged that at the beginning.

true,insidiousthought,tennant,Tennant,"The interesting bit that caught my attention was your last sentence.  All creatures consume as much or more energy to continue existence but the angels or Old Gods(OG for short)  almost perpetually exist in a lower dimension of being, i.e. frozen in time or in a sleeping state.  So we can create a hypothesis that while these creatures consume huge amounts of energy they can only expel this energy in the same way or in a continue existence in lower dimensional states.  The OG dispel the object and the PE(past energy) yet the Angels remove people to earlier fixed points to consume the maximum amount of energy to be had.

The angels fed on potential energy from the Cracks to regenerate.  The cracks were oblivion/quantum state fluctuations from the universe collapse and the extra potential energy was shunted from the future through the Cracks.  But with most things there are opposites, the Leaf is a physical object with mental impressions that holds all the potential energy of future events happening.

Furthermore, the Angels and OG stayed very stationary even though they consume huge amounts of energy.  The OG was a planet where they gave some sustenance every day and every so often woke up to fill tank on a single soul and the Angels slept as statues or took over a whole apartment building as a potential energy farm.

So as scary or mind-bogglingly voracious these entities are, they still follow the same structure of nourishment everything else has just on powers of magnitude higher than we perceive.  The Angels can move quantumly fast when not observed but don't move far when prey isn't near, the OG slumbers and get's an IV drip until a more solid nourishment is necessary.",0,1366329220,null,0,false,0,c9i36mi,t3_1cm43w,t1_c9i36mi,t3_1cm43w,null,1431507678,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

~~The film is set in the present day (well, a couple of years ago) with a sadly diminished Thatcher thinking back through her political life. She discusses it with Dennis, who it quickly becomes apparent is long dead. Thatcher is imagining him in her dementia. She is aware of it, and as things progress her daughter Carol arrives to help her pack away~~ ~~Dennis's things to go to a charity shop. The twist is that when she gets rid of the last of Dennis' things she says goodbye to him and wilfully ends her demented delusions. It's a rather unpleasant conceit because dementia is very, very different to that. It's irreversible, the suffers are confused and do not lucidly understand it's a delusion. The delusions are not friendly, and frequently cause paranoia and invariably cause distress.

My reasoning behind being so cautious in driving is that I grew up on an accident black-spot and witnessing a good few fatalities has left its indelible mark on me.
