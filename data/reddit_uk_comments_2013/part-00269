Fans have been spoiled by the Doctor Who Restoration Team, which has gone as far as inventing new techniques to restore color to color episodes that were lost and recovered, but only in black and white. Other stories that are missing episodes due to the BBC junking them have been recreated using animation, or sometimes photo reconstructions with existing audio tracks. Virtually all discs come with commentary tracks and extensive documentaries, most of them specially produced for the releases. Some come with extras such as pdf files of old comics, or the original scripts. Because Doctor Who has required so much restoration (especially to the earlier seasons), the show has mostly been released on an episode-by-episode basis. Until every episode has finally been released (barring the discovery of more missing episodes, which is very probable according to recent rumors), season box sets will probably not be available. However, discussion with those in the know suggests that if they DO become available, they will likely be vanilla releases with just the restored episodes themselves and nothing else, since most die-hard fans want the extras and will already own the individual DVD's. This is also why the individual classic releases are relatively pricey.

true,Maldovar,k9,K-9,"You're right, on every account. Those things are true. However we need to look a bit deeper. For starters look at the ""nicknames"" used both in-show and in-fandom to describe the companions (in order):
""Bad Wolf""
""The Woman Who Walked the Earth""
""The Most Important Woman in the Universe""
""The Girl Who Waited""
""The Doctor's Wife""
""The Impossible Girl""
While there can be whole novels written on the usage of ""girl"" in contrast to the earlier companions, you must look at the whole life perspective. Donna, Rose, and Martha lived 18+ years into adulthood without the Doctor's influence or even existence. When he enters their lives it's HIM entering THEIR lives. They have them. They all have families and jobs and friends and lives outside of the Doctor. 

-Meanwhile, Amy spent her whole life obsessing over the doctor. We just sort of are told her parents got sucked into the crack, but even when they return we do not get to know them at all. Hell, CLARA'S parents are better developed for what little screentime we have. The only friends Amelia has are a boy who's hopelessly in love with her and a person who it turns out is just River Song. We don't know WHY she becomes a Kissogram, and in the future we have NO idea why she's a model and why she stops being a model and then suddenly becomes a travel writer. We know more about Rory's life really than the Doctor's. The divorce storyline is its own can of worms but it was fixed because the Doctor didn't like it. And while she stops being obsessed with the Doctor, it sort of switches into being obsessed with Rory. As in we still know NOTHING about Amy, but all about her relationship with Rory.

-Rose we knew worked in a shop because she needed money due to being lower class with a single mum. She took gymnastics. She talked about friends. She had Mickey. She had her Mum. We even knew about her Mum's friends by a bit. 

-Martha we knew was in Med School and this is referenced SEVERAL times. She has a sister in government, divorced parents, an ""evil"" step mother, her brother had a wife and kid she wanted to protect. She eventually became a full doctor in UNIT. 

-Donna Noble had a father, but he past away. Her mother brow beats her and judges her. She has MOTHERFUCKING WILFRED MOTT as her grandfather, who loves astronomy and England and the Queen. She is a temp but can't hold down a job but has excellent secretarial skills. She isn't the luckiest in Love but it works out in the end. 

-River is Amy's Daughter and was born to kill the doctor, raised to kill the doctor, becomes an Archaeologist to find the doctor, is in Jail for killing the doctor (maybe? I'm unclear on this really) and only escapes (even though she VERY easily can) to be with the Doctor. She falls in love with Doctor and like that's 90% of her motivations later on. 

-Clara's mum is dead, we barely knew her and barely know her father. She is a nanny, but why? Does she have schooling? Does she have friends? How'd her mum die? How long has she been the nanny? Why is she suddenly a teacher? How did she become one? What does she teach? Does she fancy anyone? Everything else we know about her is about her just being born to save the Doctor. While she has had exactly 0 time to really develop, what time she's had has been really bad at it. '

*The country coefficient is used to rank the football associations of Europe, and thus determine the number of clubs from an association that will participate in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.*

Current UEFA rankings are;  1-Spain, 2-England, 3 Germany all get four CL places &amp; 3 Europa places then Italy(4), Portugal(5), France(6) get 3 CL &amp; 3 Europa places etc...

As a club, the coefficients are determined by your results in the last 5 seasons of the CL &amp; Europa on a points basis,it's quite complicated but here is the [criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient)

this determines your seeding for the CL draw.  Current UEFA club rankings are (1) Barca (2) Bayern (3) Real (4) Chelsea (5) Man U (6) Arsenal.

Bottom line is that it's in Chelsea's interests to see English clubs do well every year to maintain an English top 3 place in the UEFA coefficient rankings to get the maximum number of CL places, if England drop outside, only the top 3 in the PL will get a place in the CL instead of the current top 4 which would be a big revenue loss for someone!

That's beside the fact that it tramples all over the right to silence, and forces people into self-incrimination.  If you want to catch people using digital communications you've got plenty of attack vectors open to you as the NSA and GCHQ have shown. 

Also RIPA is indiscriminate, you don't have to charged with any crime as far as I know for it to be in effect.  The police can throw you in jail with RIPA if you're just a suspect in another case.  You can literally go to jail just for staying silent under questioning.

In the U.K. what you have instead is more alarms and knives being used, with the old and the weak being left defenseless. In the U.S. it's the exact opposite, in the areas with the most gun control there is enormous crime rates, involving murder, rape, theft, burglary.  While in the states with the least gun control then there is the exact opposite.  Generally very few actually have weapons, but those who do use them to protect people, and know how to use them.  There are accidents but they do not happen very often, maybe 1 time out of a 100,000 times a gun is used.  



If you would actually look into the mass shootings that occur in the U.S.(I'm assuming you haven't because I have debated this with many people of the U.K.) then you would notice that they all occur in areas that are ""gun free zones"" like schools, malls, and military bases. Also if you look into countries that have a lot of chaos you'll see that a lot of them have some sort of ban on assault rifles.

Mainstream religions are more interested in helping their members and society. A cult is also often criminal, closed off, won't allow questioning and coerce members into giving lots of free labour and money to make the cult rich and powerful. Cults often ""attack"" critics and defectors**

 Mainstream religions ( and their leadership ) are trying to do what they think is best for society ( even if that negatively impacts people - ie being against gays today and punishing ""heretics"" in the past ).  Cults only interest is the best interest of the cult

&gt;Operation Snow White was the Church of Scientology's internal name for a major criminal conspiracy during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries.[1]** It was the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents**

&gt;'squirrel busters': How teams with cameras fixed to their hats 'stalk' church defectors

It's hard to imagine any modern mainstream religion doing this to people. This is because *their* definition of treating people well is at the center of most mainstream religions. A cult like scientology puts the interests of scientology becoming more rich and powerful first before treating people well. 

( yes there have been pedophile preists, and financially corrupt pastors but the behavior ( whilst sometimes being covered up by the leadership) is never authorised by the leadership ) 

A cult is often criminal, closed off, encourage cutting of contact with family,  won't allow criticism or questioning, encourage members to do things that don't benefit the members but benefit the cult ( ie working long hours for cult ). Cults are often more interested in amassing wealth, power, control and sometimes sex from members rather than helping them.  Cults often try and punish those who leave and those who criticise them.

Cults are criminally self interested, religions try and use god to help people and encourage people to be more moral ( moral being what church defines as moral ). I don't believe in either of them but give me a modern mainstream religion over a cult any day.

Or for not knowing them, if the authorities refuse to believe that.

In principle, if you experimented with an encryption system a while ago with completely legal and boring data, then forgot those old files were laying around and forgot the passwords, all that's between you and prison is some bad luck.

Or... if someone else gets access to your PC, puts encryped files on it somewhere that you never even knew about, waits a little while then makes an anonymous accusation against you...

That's probably a pretty effective way to set someone up. After all, you don't have to risk being caught with illegal files yourself - you don't need to carry illegal files with you at all. You create the encrypted file on your targets PC, and it doesn't matter that there's no illegal data in that file - without the passwords (which even you forget) no-one can prove that.

So your victim goes to prison because he can't provide keys to prove there's no illegal data in an encrypted file that was planted on his machine, he didn't know about, he never knew the keys for, and which (though your victim can't know it) doesn't contain any illegal data anyway.

What we didn't know then and do now is that he also has a sleep disorder that was previously undiagnosed, but made worse by side effects of his anti-depressants.

After ATOS fucked us around in the appeals process, making his depression worse and giving him all sorts of anxiety problems, we gave up; now he has a diagnosis for his sleep apnia, we're going to try again.

true,rumplefistbump,null,null,"Edit Preface: this is my opinion based on my own logic, please get proper advice if you need it.

The threshold before you pay any Capital Gains tax is £10,900

Read this:

https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax

If you take proper records you can say how much the winning amount was worth in £ on the day you won, and base your taxable profit calculation on increases since then.

By this logic, if your winnings appreciate in value rapidly and you make another bet with said winnings, you should be liable for tax on the profit that you have realised at the point you enter the bet. 

So if you lose, you may still be liable for tax on pre-bet profits because you may be gambling the tax-man's money.

You're betting money that would otherwise be taxable if you realised gains by liquidating, but if you win there will be no taxable gains. Sound a little like tax evasion? ~~laundering~~


I suppose if you won a house, didn't live in it and let it out for years, then came to sell it you'd have to treat it the same way. 

Valuation the day you won (and didn't liquidate), minus valuation on the day you sold or bet again = technically profit.

If your records are poor and you are investigated then you're liable to have the harshest application of tax since you can't explain yourself fully.

2) College life is much like campus life but on a much smaller, more individual scale. Whilst classes and exams are held for everyone in the university at the same time, you will have regular meetings with academic staff to review the work you do, usually in very small groups, so as to really focus on your issues and questions. Beyond academic interests, a College really takes care of your every need, there are sports grounds, scheduled events, student societies a student bar and lounge, and usually some kind of canteen, for *every* College. It also holds most of the administrative services you will ever interact with. It's a microcosm.  

3) From an external view point there should be no significant prestige differences between Colleges.

Ok, so let's cut out those other payments from your total

Drinking

* 95 to 175

Smoking

* ?. Estimates I've looked around at suggest savings of 70% compared to normal smoking, so unless you are smoking the equivalent of a pack a week then I'm dubious about the cost being ""pennies"".

Phone

* 65 to 145

Food

* -5 to 75

Bills

* -110 to -30 

Now, that's clearly not good. Also, this is you guessing some of the figures. By far, the most important thing you can do at the moment is track each and every penny. Some figures may surprise you, often when thinking about spending we remember the regular spends but forget the ""one off"" ones. One offs happen extremely regularly though.

Potential savings:

Drinking. **This is a phenomenal amount of your income**. It is non-essential.

Smoking. Again, non-essential. Even a very low cost here is significant. 

Your phone. Good lord, that's an expensive contract. That's 5 hours of working a month right there. Find out if you can terminate that *immediately*. Get a £10 phone (not per month, £10).

That takes us back to

* -55 to 25

A potentially positive balance, assuming the figures are right.

There is science when it comes to drivers and speed and there is evidence that overly restrictive speed limits are actually worse for safety. When you add speed cameras into the mix it can start to get downright dangerous.

I don't accept speeding as being the sign of a bad driver, for a whole host of reasons. I agree that the law is the law, and it should be followed, however I think an overhaul *is* needed on speed limits and laws surrounding them, especially considering the numbers of people who exceed the speed limit (often to at least 80-90mph on UK dual carriageways and motorways) on a daily basis.

I agree with and respect the 30mph speed limit in built-up areas (defined often by the presence of street lightning and homes), even though this speed limit is archaic and stems back to a time when a large majority of cars all had horrendously inefficient braking and safety systems. (We're talking the 20s/30s here).

The 70mph speed limit on dual carriageways and motorways was introduced *permanently* in 1967 (Yes, that's close to half a century ago!). Again, at a time when cars were using very inefficient brake and safety systems and the majority of family cars couldn't exceed much more than 70mph to begin with.

We've had the same speed limit on UK motorways permanently for nearly 50 years, whilst you have to admit that car safety and efficiency has grown ten-fold, and the number of UK road deaths has fallen year-on-year since 1960.

I tend to stick to 70mph religiously anyway, but I couldn't even begin to work out how many people break limit consistently on any journey that I take.

Between my rent, bills, food, car, overdraft, and loans from friends (for moving to a new job) I have nothing left after my wage. I also, until very recently, had to support a girlfriend who couldn't get employed. We are both recent graduates.

I was fortunate enough to have a job in my field during uni and worked up a hot enough CV/interview to get offers for jobs within a month of looking post graduation. None of the jobs offered enough to get me out of debt, and I'm on the higher end of graduate salary thanks to my previous job.

My girlfriend can't get a job in her field.

This is why we have fast-growing rent arrears problems. No one is paying enough, everyone is charging too much and there's nothing we can do about it.

No, we started rescuing banks to stop a financial slaughter of the public while asserting that the public might not want to subsidise students getting degrees in the Beatles, etc. - but it's interesting that you put it in terms of 'lower support', not 'making others pay for'.

&gt;while freezing public sector wages (doctors, midwifes, nurses etc).

This has been going on for decades. If you don't like it, campaign for higher national insurance payments. And please, don't put doctors in the same wage-area as midwives and nurses. It's insulting to the latter.

&gt;Meanwhile the bankers at the banks that the public bought out - got very high bonuses (that's not an exaggeration). 

Because they'd already been put in place and to not pay them would in several cases result in them suing the bank that we own for not honouring a contract. And winning.

&gt;And it was us citizens which had to both expose AND stop this (funny enough Hugh Grant the actor had a hand to play).

It wasn't just News Corp, but people are on trial as we speak for this.

&gt;•Then we find out our state run media BBC - fresh from the churning 'Terrorist' and Iraq propaganda - then went into the business of actively covering up peadofiles.

Not really, unless you're going to count Saville as 'all the BBC'. So far, these assertions are very tabloid-reductionist-to-sell-fear, and I'm only halfway through.

&gt;•Voting for 'change' and a the hope of low/no student fees somehow raised them by 300%

If you're going to pretend that we're not in financial dire straits that precipitate stuff like the above, I'm not sure where you're going with that. We did (vote for change), which is why our economy is now recovering despite Labour insisting that it wouldn't for the past few years since getting kicked out for being so amazingly clueless. 

&gt;•Mixed with the pay freezes and economic injustice we tried to protest.

There was protest; stop playing the victim and presenting two incidents as the norm. But don't pretend that protesting is an automatic badge of righteousness - people protested against the poll tax, despite it being blatantly fairer that only homeowners paying for local services and having no real alternative. Note how even then, labour assumed that attacking policies would stop anyone noticing that they didn't have any of their own. Kind of like now.

&gt;•Then we have people being arrested for social media updates. &lt;- wtf?

You're unfamiliar with bullying or defamation?

&gt;•We have people being arrested and detained for planning to stage a peaceful protest in London during the Queens jubilee, 

Again, not the norm. And judging by the pro-royal mood at the jubilee, I wouldn't have guaranteed their safety anyway.

&gt;•The GCHQ/NSA/Snowden spying scandal and of course the internet filter.

Most of which wasn't that surprising. ""Hey, windows has a backdoor!"" is something we learned about NT4. And it's not illegal to use a VPN or a proxy.

&gt;•The UK refusing to abide by the UN's notion that internet privacy is a human right. 

That's right, along with a number of other countries. If you think the sites you visit (or what's in the emails you send) are really going to be a matter of national security interest, VPN is a place to start.


So, to summarise - giving a one-sided, populist opinion that ignores key facts in order to presumably fit with your predetermined opinion, *that's* why you get called a conspiracy theorist and don't get engaged in debate - you've set your stall out so obviously that there's no point.

An example: The amphetamine molecule is simply tweaked and adjusted until a stable, similar form can be produced, which is legal. The backlog from a compound being available to it being made illegal is several years long and by that time a new structure has been synthesised. It's an utterly pointless never-ending race. And as you say, the ones that have existed for longest have the most data regarding safety (I would much rather a friend took MDMA than mephedrone, or cannabis rather than spice).

******
Here are some excerpts from a book I wrote, if you're interested:

&gt;Synthetic cannibinoids are normally collectively referred to as ‘spice’. These have gained in popularity in recent years and are easily purchased, often legally, using the Internet. Preliminary information suggests they produce their effects via the endocannabinoid system in a similar manner to THC. Reports of fatal intoxication from spice use are increasing. Calls for advice regarding spice to the American Association of Poison Control Centres rose from 53 calls in 2009 to over 6000 in 2011. Synthetic cannibinoids may have a stronger affinity to and greater potency at cannabinoid receptors, in addition to having a longer half-life^114

&gt;Mephedrone has been directly implicated in over one hundred deaths in the UK, although little information is available regarding its effects^110. Worryingly, between 2011 to 2012, the number of deaths in the UK tripled from 6 to 18^2. Again, it produces a similar clinical picture to khat or amphetamines and has specifically been associated with acute myocarditis111. 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) falls into the substituted amphetamine class and again very sparse data exist.

true,Richeh,null,null,"Size isn't an invalid metric in this case.  Consider this; if I said ""I've found a cure for cancer"", you'd call me a fucking liar.  If a medical research company said ""We've found a cure for cancer"" then you'd be excited.  

Now imagining, and don't be insulted by this, that you don't understand any science whatsoever, either of us could be telling the truth or neither of us could be.  You'd be putting your faith in one of us.  Or neither.  But you'd be an idiot to drink a jar of what, knowing me, could well be dog piss rather than letting a doctor give you a healthy, consensus-endorsed dose of lethal radiation.

The point is that with consensus and authority comes security.  But if a medical authority told you to take *this* pill daily then you'll do it because, well, everyone does it, someone's checked up on this, right?  But if they told you to eat poo, then you'd question it, hopefully.  The ridiculousness of the request is also a factor.  Scientology is a massive organization, but you have to ask, if they're asking people to eat poo then *do they get to be an authority*?  Catholic Medicine (TM) has a pill for you to take; they both have research portfolios, you can't check up on them but you've just *witnessed Scientology fake its research in crayon under the desk*.  Catholicism may be written in crayon, but at least you don't *know* it's fake.  Now, I'd say the smart thing to do is to walk out of the room and enjoy what life you have left, but some people need hope.  So they pick a side and hope for the best.  And sometimes it's the hope that's important, but bear in mind that one of these authorities just made a dying man eat poop so personally I resent them receiving his money, too.

And you're probably thinking ""that's science, this is religion, it's different"", but, well, fundamentally it isn't.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; No, you believe UKIP has no solutions because your political ideology and identification of the issues doesn't align with them.

You're right that UKIP doesn't fit my ideology, but to suggest that it is because I have been *fed* something is an interesting point of view. I'd actually suggest that its because I reject almost everything I see in the mainstream and would describe UKIP as *more of the same*, like a new brand of food they aren't offering anything new, just re badging it as something different. It's probably made in the same factory as conservative ideology, but designed in the same way, but is marketed in a manner as to confuse you.

Fundamentally, I disagree with the type of ideology that gives rise to political views that are held by parties like ukip. The main thesis you should take away from my, and many others, view on UKIP is that they are a *populist reactionary party*. Reactionary politics is the worst kind of politics and uses a lot of creativity to hide what it really is. It is not about specific policies or what people publicly say because ideology influences and depends on this to shift.

&gt; Politics is fear. All politics...

No, reactionary politics is fear. Even the notion that it *has* to be about fear is ideological. Surely you can conceive of a form of progressive politics that is essentially about moulding the world you would like to live in, if you want to know what we have lost in this country it is that these views of hopefulness are not aired in the mainstream?

If your view is that fear is the motivator, fear becomes your motivator. The fact that you hold this view and support a party like UKIP is not a coincidence it is a necessary requirement of the ideology. 

&gt; Once you cut through the bullshit, as you suggest, UKIP has pretty reasonable, pretty achievable goals, and seem to be the only party in British politics with the potential ability and real conviction to make them happen.

&gt; It seems to me that you're the one that has been caught up in the rhetoric and are unable to see past what you've been fed.

*This* is rhetoric, the shape it takes is *everything everyone else says to you is wrong, we have the answer*. No-one has ""the answer"", and presenting your arguments like this is something that reactionary politics demands of its ideologues. 

For example, let us focus on the key principle of all reactionary politics and, coincidentally, UKIPs core base that unites the vast majority of its support; *immigration*.

Immigration, to some extent inevitable, we cannot go back to a golden age without sacrificing something else. I will admit that it causes problems at the bottom end of the labour market, but the issue is not immigrants themselves but the economic imprisonment most people have, this is a problem that we can solve and we need to solve. Immigration is a distraction, a *fear* that stops you from trying to create a better world and this *fear* is a founding principle of reactionary rhetoric and has been there since the vote was introduced to ordinary people.  This is not standing for something new, Powell said it in his rivers of blood speech and the reactionaries have said it for years and years.

The policy of protecting borders in one that is often ill thought out and badly conceived. Very few people have a conception of what it costs, how its done, and how it can be improved, and the people that do understand rarely call for a significant shift in practices its normally just more staff. The key thing you should think about with how policing borders works is that It all costs money but it doesn't generate wealth.

At the same time we have a global economic system that *depends* on the free movement of capital yet they want to impose tighter restrictions on immigration - this is a huge contradiction because capital demands the cheapest labour possible. Essentially, lets treat ""strict"" immigration policy as wanting to build a metaphorical wall. The issue is that this ""wall"" will cost a percentage of our GDP - the more we spend on it the more we have to take money away from other parts of our country. This means raising taxes (which UKIP are opposed to) or cuts to other services - which *will* reduce our quality of life.

I don't agree with the economic system, but we have to look at it from a different point of view. If we remove immigration but don't change the underlying economic premise how do we operate? There isn't really an answer to this question because you can't realistically change one without the other; any impact on the cost of labour has an impact on the cost of goods.

They are a reactionary party who's key principle is that they are more ""hard line"" or ""tough"" (which is a common form of language used by reactionaries that promises few specifics) on EU/immigration/etc than all of the other existing reactionary ""mainstream"" politicians. The *problem* with politics (democratic and not) is that it is far too reactionary, the last thing we need is more of it.

I have one question for you though, perhaps, the most telling thing about political parties. Who funds UKIP? There media campaign is *huge* this requires a lot of money.

He's illustrating that if someone decides the limits don't apply to them while the majority on the roads do, accidents will (and do) happen. You may as well insist that you can drive perfectly well whilst drunk (which people do), which is why these types of laws are in place to begin with.

&gt;Why would a safe and responsible driver plow into the back of another driver if they are using their best judgement to drive at a safe speed?

Why? Because it's an *accident*. A safe driver could be on the motorway, then another driver who asserts that they're driving completely safely cuts in front of them (going faster than the speed limit, let's say) and there's your plow. There are already far too many drivers that assume ducking-and-diving in and out of traffic is the same on the motorway as it is in town - which is why nobody insists that *they* have a handle on when it's 'safe' to ignore restrictions.

&gt;Your logic is exactly the kind of idiotic logic that makes driving unsafe. 

Says the guy who appears to assert that personally assessing your own driving ability is all that's needed to ensure safety. Your kind of logic is shared by half the idiots that drive like that.

&gt;They like you are unable to make a judgement as to what is a safe speed to travel at.

You're using drivers' opinions of their own abilities to defend going faster than the limit, then giving examples of drivers' abilities not always being up to scratch. Explain the logic there.

You may as well assert that you've never had an accident, so why should you need a seat belt?",0,1386853276,null,0,false,0,cdzy3ye,t3_1speuy,t1_cdzy3ye,t1_cdzxgsn,null,1428257498,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Appropriate: Assume the rights of the owner. In deciding to keep something that is not yours, you assume the rights of the owner in dishonest fashion. Selling it on also counts since only the owner has the right to do that.

4: For the law to be applied equally and fairly the government needs to be able to access this data, otherwise crimes can be forever hidden.

I suspect that was also the reason for the Olympics example you gave earlier - compared to letting everyone go full-speed and then queue for an hour instead, the journey time is the same, sometimes faster.

And even ignoring that, slower speeds *do* mean safer roads, unless you missed one of the adverts that have played for decades about how likely you are to die depending on how fast a car is going when it hits you. That's why inner-city areas have reduced some roads down to 20 - if a child walks out in front of your car, then regardless of whether it's their fault, all the pleas about how you were *sure* it was safe to go at 40 won't mean squat.

I prefer to read the actual law as is on the statute books.

Section 51A of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (as inserted by section 19 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009) provides the offense of ""soliciting"".

51A Soliciting.

(1) It is an offence for a person in a street or public place to solicit another (B) for the purpose of obtaining B's sexual services as a prostitute.

(2) The reference to a person in a street or public place includes a person in a vehicle in a street or public place.

(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.

(4) In this section “street” has the meaning given by section 1(4) of the Street Offences Act 1959.


Section 53A of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 adds the offence of ""paying for sexual services of a prostitute subjected to force etc"" and is a strict liability offece where the client can be prosecuted under this even if they were completely unaware the prostitute was forced.

I think you misunderstand what I mean by reactionary. This isn't flash in the pan at all; it is probably the dominant political force in our political process today. The tabloids are reactionary, it is a better term to describe a party than 'right wing' but this is essentially what it is. It boils down to a belief that there is either a past political structure that we should be trying to get back to or that the status quo can handle the changes of the future without needing to be reformed.

It is a mistake in an age of huge social and technological change to believe that the political structure can stay the same. The EU is a response to this, not being part of the EU is not a response to change. With globalisation and huge shifts in automation we need to progress to a democratic governing body that is capable of balancing the needs of the people on a mass scale.

I'm not arguing that the EU is the best model for this (I don't think it is) but a return to the roots of the united kingdom isn't either. The entire notion of *a nation* is only about 200 years old; it has served useful purposes but we need something else to handle the change. Being opposed to the EU is not a problem, it is the proposed set of alternatives that is. UKIP lacks this sense of vision but the rhetoric used implies that opposition to the EU is something new. What happens if a referendum goes against them? What do they propose then? 

&gt; All parties have questionable and special interest money behind them, who do you think funds the Greens?

This isn't about other parties. By refusing to challenge the funding model of other parties UKIP don't really offer any change.

&gt; I don't think UKIP would ever renege on their main goals if they got into coalition and I think they'd force those goals to be implemented, which has to be a better option than voting for the abolishment of tuition fees just to see them tripled, I reckon.

A largely untested party with the same questionable political tactics as the existing parties can offer me no respite in this. If you're arguing UKIP are something new, cutting through the bullshit that exists in west minster then they need to do a lot more than simply state likeable rhetoric which is really easy to do without the reigns of power.

Well perhaps you were too busy raging to understand then. I guess I'll have to go line by line.

&gt;RIPA isn't ""the paedophile catching law,"" although I'm sure the government is happy that you think that.

I don't, and didn't say that, here's something I actually said: 'I'm not saying RIPA is perfect but I was pointing out that it isn't as black and white as ""the government are taking our rights"". '

&gt; The fact is, that police aren't going to catch paedophiles with thousands of serious abuse images. Even the most retarded of criminals is just going to take the three year RIPA sentence over imprisonment for paedophila related crimes.

Again with RIPA, missing the point, let me repeat the point: 'The government clearly need some method to enforce the law and getting the balance right is difficult. That's what my point was.'

&gt;At any rate the abuse the police would find on the hard drive - already been committed. You want to stop paedophiles, how about some proactive policing instead of this reactive bullshit that affects us all?

Wat? That's even more authoritarian than anything that's happening currently. Does he look a bit like a criminal? Better pro-actively arrest him incase he commits a crime in the future! 

&gt;If it's cool for policing to just change when it likes and take our rights away ""for our safety"" then fuck it, let's just move to 24 hours surveillance of every citizen, that solves the problem in one move. 

When did we ever have rights to absolute privacy? It has always been the case that if the finger of suspicion points at you, the police can obtain a court order and go through your personal belongings and everything you have. The situation has now changed such that your personal information can be encrypted such that it is literally impossible for them to crack it without technology that has not yet been perfected (quantum computers). 

Again if you have read and understood my posts you would have seen that this is the point I am raising: there needs to be some way of legitimately searching this data to enforce the rule of law, but there appears to be no happy way to make that work. The only alternative appears to be to let it be and stop the rule of law at the digital realm, which doesn't appear to me to be an ideal situation either.",0,1386856994,null,0,false,0,cdzyypu,t3_1snugj,t1_cdzyypu,t1_cdzyua9,null,1428257100,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

and a linked article:

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2013/08/17/the-uk-declares-economic-warfare-on-its-gibraltar-tax-haven/

You can argue the toss about tax, avoidance, or whatever else but your clam that whole ""Tax Haven"" issue was solved a decade ago seems to palpably wrong from the evidence available. 

I really don't know how much one has ""keep up"" if the conversation is less than a year old. 


Let's deal with this hyperbolic nonsense:

&gt;. Did I denounce the system of governance? Did I preach that British police and soldiers should be beheaded? Did I say I wanted to recreate the UK as a ME shithole? No; I integrated, I studied, I served my country, I paid taxes and took part in the political system.

Okay, let's take that apart. 

&gt;. Did I denounce the system of governance? 

Part of being British is that you can denounce your own system of government. It's called democracy ""kid"". Calling it rubbish and demanding it change is an right of citizenship. You choose not to say that, others do. You don't have to like it but it doesn't make anyone less of a citizen for doing it - because it's a right, not privilege. 

 
&gt;Did I preach that British police and soldiers should be beheaded? 

Again, see above. People get to say things you hate because they have the right to. Just because you don't like it doesn't take away THEIR citizenship. We had British people demanding IRA prisoners be given rights under the Geneva convention. We also had the whole argument on the ""Shoot-to-kill"" policy that led to a famous incident in Gibraltar. 

Again, same as the first point. You don't get to choose. You can complain bitterly about it and hate it, but you don't get to choose whether that person is British or not. 

&gt;Did I say I wanted to recreate the UK as a ME shithole?

Again, see the above point. Also the place you're referring to is Saudi, and Saudi isn't a ""shithole"". Kind of puts the ""my own research"" bit of your rant in perspective. 

Now yes, you're going to use the false comparison of saying ""ahh but what would life for me be like there as a X"". Simply put, if your were a Saudi, in Saudi, it won't be the slums of Soweto that's for sure. 

Oh and before you go into the rest of the countries on your list, you need to read some books on their history, colonialism, the effects of civil war and the formation of political systems. You'll find better answers there than any trawl through web-based think tanks and half arsed web commentary.  

Also, isn't Gibraltar an exercise of trying to create ""over here"" , ""over there""? Haven't people recreated a version of Britain by the sea there? This is a natural process of population movement, it's the a process of amelioration and setting out identities through various forms of cultural expression. It happens everywhere. 

This is what I mean by lack of self-awareness. You seem to revel in the condemnation of a process that your own personal history should show is a natural consequence of people being people. 

Again you may not agree with tenets of it, but that's not the point. 

&gt;No; I integrated, I studied, I served my country, I paid taxes and took part in the political system.

This implies that integration is only one set of terms. Considering they are British born, educated and have been part of that society all that lives means that they are already part of society. You, by your own admission, were not. Again, it's a false comparison. Where as people who are born here may have integrate within existing parts of society, your process is a different one. 

Again, stunning lack of self-awareness. You share that with a lot of first generation immigrants actually, as studies have shows ( I'll try dig on out) that most immigrants do try adopt majority culture depending on the economic barriers and/or the state of the society they arrive in.  

Secondly, what's ""I served"" got to do with anything? You seem to imply that having military experience is somehow a superior state of citizenship than not. It isn't. In fact, it wasn't even enough to get you citizenship (scandalous and racist as that policy was). Heck, I'm in a family that served in various ways from 1900, including a brief stint by me. 

So, like I said - the overseas territory you come from was named after an Arab, was used as base for parking ships ( and still is) by the Royal Navy - thus being dependent of the state , has a history of tax evasion. 

You show a lack of self-awareness in comparing both Gib's teleology and your own when tackling these subjects simply because you seem to be unable to either understand socio-economic processes and their implication with reference to both.

solicit
səˈlɪsɪt/
verb
gerund or present participle: soliciting

    1.
    ask for or try to obtain (something) from someone.
    ""he called a meeting to solicit their views""
    synonyms:	ask for, request, apply for, put in for, seek, beg, plead for, sue for, crave, canvass, call for, drum up, press for; More
    rareimpetrate
    ""Phil had been trying to solicit his help all morning""
    ask, beg, beseech, implore, plead with, entreat, appeal to, apply to, lobby, petition, importune, canvass, supplicate, call on, press, pressure;
    rareobsecrate
    ""they are endlessly solicited for their opinions""

        ""historians and critics are solicited for opinions by the auction houses""
    2.
    accost someone and offer one's or someone else's services as a prostitute.

You'll note that it is the act of *offering* sex that is illegal, not the act of paying for it. I.e. it's illegal to advertise the services, but *the service itself is not illegal*.

GCHQ sees that they're communicating, recognizes the pattern, police swoop in, but bam, all the incriminating data is encrypted. What now?


Alternative example, say that a group of hackers has stolen massive amounts of account information from banks. They've carefully covered their tracks on the servers that were compromised, but they're storing the data encrypted on their own systems. The police get a tip off and swoop in, but the data is encrypted, there's no other evidence to go by, what do they do?

There are other situations too, e.g. money laundering, fraud, where the incriminating evidence could be entirely digital.

&gt;That's a shitty attitude.

Darwinism is very efficient in that it if a method doesn't work to such a degree, it(and those who practice it) will simply expire, and it won't be too soon for Britain if current trends continue.

&gt;You've also jumped from what was a comment I made about anti semitism in the UK to modern day refugees,

except my post was always about the similarities of issues of brining in too many refugees, regardless of the time period. You're simply tired of having to defend current bullshit because the Jews argument is easier.

Don't patronise people, it makes you look like a cock.

&gt;The government clearly need some method to enforce the law

You keep saying this.  What law specifically are you trying to enforce here - or is RIPA just a catch all for anyone the police want it to apply to? You don't need to have broken the law for RIPA to apply to you.  A customs agent can grab you out of line at the airport and demand you hand over encryption keys to your laptop.  What law benefits from that kind of ""enforcement?""

&gt;It has always been the case that if the finger of suspicion points at you, the police can obtain a court order and go through your personal belongings and everything you have. 

The police need a good reason to gain entry to your house and search private property.  They simply need your silence to jail you over your digital possessions.  That seems like balance to you?

&gt;The situation has now changed such that your personal information can be encrypted such that it is literally impossible for them to crack it

Been the case for a long time, and yet other countries seem to struggle along without crapping on their citizens' rights.

&gt;Again if you have read and understood my posts you would have seen that this is the point I am raising: there needs to be some way of legitimately searching this data

And here's where you have completely failed to comprehend the argument against RIPA - no the government does not need a way of ""legitimately"" invading my privacy.  But that makes it clear why you argue the way you do in defence of RIPA. 

&gt;Does he look a bit like a criminal? 

That's bullshit and you know it - you're talking about profiling which is *not* pro-active policing.

true,high-ho,lfc99,,"David Usher (the author) gets a lot right here but also looks for problems where there are none. Rodgers has always been a coach who develops teams from the ground up. He's said many times that he's building a club and a squad for the future. That's why Aspas and Alberto came in. Are they superstars right now? No, absolutely not. But neither was Mascherano when he first arrived. Nor Lucas. Nor Suarez. Nor Gerrard, come to that. Claiming that Liverpool ""needs"" to buy more proven midfield strength to get into the top four is speculative at best.

Losing Mascherano and Alonso was always going to be damaging. Personally, I'd still love to see Alonso back at Anfield. But those times are gone, and building towards a solid team for a year or two from now is the right approach for the club. Maybe we get top four this year, maybe we don't. But as long as we keep playing the style of football that this club deserves, with more consistent application of the technique, stamina, and philosophy that we've already seen flashes of this season, our present midfield will only get better and better. Combine that with the (potential) defensive solidity that Rodgers bought in last summer, and you've got an amazing squad on your hands.

The midfield will continue to develop. I'm not saying it's perfect and nothing should change. (Clearly Rodgers agrees; that's why Moses came in, after all, as an attempt at a temporary fix.) The fact is, though, that combinations of Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Coutinho, and Gerrard are quickly becoming a terrifying prospect for opponents. Drop Alberto and Sterling into the middle, too, and the story gets more threatening still.

Oh, and I'd also like to dismiss the idea that Liverpool's transfer strategy ""failed"" last summer. We didn't get some first choice players, e.g. Mkhitaryan, but we brought in Sakho, Alberto, Aspas, Mignolet, and Toure. That's damn good business, if you ask me. And looking further back, to last January, Rodgers brought in Coutinho and Sturridge.

The idea that Liverpool's transfer dealings have been poor is simply wrong. Not every player will work out. But, on balance, look at how much quality has come into the squad and it's easy to see the strategy and excellence of the business having been done.",0,1386859824,null,0,false,0,cdzzthz,t3_1spdhz,t1_cdzzthz,t3_1spdhz,null,1428256700,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

In what the CEO called a “proud day for UKFF” ukfffc.co.uk is delighted to announce and congratulate Gboly Ariyibi who is in advances Contract talks  with Nationwide Championship side Leeds Utd.

Leeds under Brian McDermott are pushing hard for promotion to the Premiership and IF the talks are successful and agreement is reached on both sides, Gboly will do all he can to make the first team but understands impressing the Under 21 Manager is the priority.

Gboly wrote as follows to UKFF FC on the 12th September 2013 as follows:

Ewemade,[UKFF Director of Football]

I’m an ex-Southampton FC player, having spent 8 years in their academy and U21\’s setup. I\’m now looking for new opportunities across the football leagues.

I play L &amp; R wing as I’m strong with both feet, but I’ve also had some of my strongest games playing behind the striker. I’d like to send you my football CV and Southampton match footage at the earliest opportunity.

I’ve just spoken to Dennis [UKFF Head Coach] and keen on showing my skills and ability during the match this Saturday 14th. I’ll be pleased if you contact me to arrange as soon as possible.

Thanks, G Ariyibi ”

“This is a proud day for everyone at UKFF and shows that the project is on track. Gboly is responsible for his progress by his sheer ability but the hard work of UKFF staff in supporting him and offering him a platform to sharpen his skills this season plays its part as well.” added UKFF Chief Executive.

And in a message to his UKFF colleagues Gboly said ” Whether or not these discussions are successful,  I wont forget anyone at UKFF. They were the guys that gave me the strength and to keep me sane  by offering me the chance to keep in shape.

Simple, start a petition.

The real question, though, is the proposed solution. Slashing rates would encourage small businesses, but would no doubt result in legal proceedings from the large chains as their rates would be deemed unfair. Or even worse, they would benefit from these same slashed rates and we would see the same influx of cr*p to the high street.

Another solution is revenue-based rates, much like the current taxation system. At the end of each fiscal year, you would have to submit details of your business' revenue to the local council, your rates would then be calculated for the coming 12 months. This would mean that those empty spaces could be filled and paid for by small businesses quite easily.

Yet one more solution is the return of the arcade. Several small stores share one retail space, splitting the rates between them. Most startups do not need a full sized storefront, so councils could split suitably sized, long-term empty spaces into smaller spaces, connected by a single entrance. This works well in high foot traffic areas (London especially) and would bring in at least some revenue for the council.",0,1386860535,null,0,false,0,ce002a6,t3_1spul4,t1_ce002a6,t3_1spul4,null,1428256586,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Everyone had a fantastic day, we all brought something for the meal/drinks and they didn't wake up to post Xmas credit card bill regret.

The simple fact about Xmas is very few of us actually even want many of the presents we're given. We open the present, give the forced ""thanks"" and muster together half a smile just so as not to offend the giver. Even the toys the kids get, one or two will get played with and the rest will get put in a cupboard and gather dust. If people are skint they're far better telling the grown ups they'll not be getting any presents and having the family club together to buy kids a couple of things they actually want rather than feeling the need to give them a load of shite just for the sake of the ""present count"". For example 10 relations putting in £30 each could buy a new PS3 or Xbox 360 and a handful of games which I'm quite sure a kid would appreciate more than a pile of £20 or so cheapo toys they'll hardly ever play with.

I am constantly amazed at the idiots that bomb along at the posted speed limits simply because it's the speed limit. They rely upon the speed limit to tell them the speed at which they can drive and they completely fail to account for the road conditions.

Given the mindless moron who sticks to the speed limit, or the driver who judges conditions and drives accordingly, I'll go for the latter every day. Myself personally I do drive faster than the limit on a regular basis but equally I drive slower than the speed limit on a regular basis, whereas the majority of supposedly law abiding drivers are actually much more dangerous because they drive at the speed limit.

Speed wasn't the overriding factor in the Sheppy crossing, there is no mention that anyone was speeding, in fact they were following the speed limit. The problem was that they were not driving at an appropriate speed for the conditions. Something I have been banging on about constantly.

I haven't fully thought this argument through, it's just an idea I'm toying with so please take it as such.

But perhaps there are actions and things that the ""nothing to hide, nothing to fear"" argument legitimately applies against. I mean, say person A has a child, that child goes missing, and a few days later they are seen driving to the woods. They disappear into the woods with something and a shovel, they come back with the shovel. Seems pretty suspicious right? Is it not acceptable to ask them to prove that what they did in the woods was completely legitimate?

Ok, that's not a great example because we have external circumstances to arouse suspicion. 

Here's perhaps a better one. If I went and bought several tonnes of fertilizer, I'd be immediately put on a watch list. I think that's actually pretty reasonable, because fertilizer can be used to make explosives, and your average person has no legitimate use for such a large quantity. Now if the police knock on my door and I point out that I own a farm, I have given a reasonable excuse.

If they find a hard drive (not in and of itself incriminating), they can punish you with jail time for not giving them the encryption keys.  It's feasible that this could amount to incriminating yourself further with regards to the crime they're investigating, or with regards to a completely separate crime.  So you've lost both the right to silence and to not incriminate yourself. 

&gt; but that doesn't amount to zero privacy.

This is true to a degree if due process has been followed, i.e the police need a damn good reason to look at the data, or you need to actually be charged with a crime and there's reason to believe the data is related to that crime; but RIPA brushes that due process aside.  Idealistically I still don't like really like that solution, but at least you'd be at the point where the average ""innocent until guilty"" citizen has some protection.  If the police want these powers over people, they should have to work seriously hard for it at a case by case level.

The complainant considered that the newspaper had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice. The newspaper had published an article about the massacre of Polish Jews at Jedwabne. The complainant was concerned that the headline, ‘The treachery of Jedwabne: new film reveals Polish town's shame on the day in WW2 when the Christian half slaughtered the Jewish half, then blamed the Nazis’, gave the misleading impression that half of the village had been responsible for the death of the other half. He said that official sources indicated that only around 40 people had been responsible. The complainant was also concerned that the article had not made clear that Nazi police had been present at the time of the event.   

Clause 1 (Accuracy) states that “the press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information”. The Commission considers headlines in the context of the stories that accompany them rather than as standalone statements. The text of the article had made clear that the perpetrators had been “a crowd of Christian Poles”. The Commission also noted that the article explained that the perpetrators had been acting with “the authorisation of the Nazis”. While the Commission noted the complainant’s concerns, it was satisfied that the headline, read in the context of the article as a whole, had not been significantly misleading. There was no breach of the Code. 

And my full text of the complain:

Thank you for your e-mai. As I have explained in merits of my complaint, there are historical inaccuracies presented in the newspaper. Daily Mail suggested in that article things which according to official sources didn't have place. This means that a reader will have a wrong impression on what really had happened in the described story. As I've indicated, main inaccuracies were:

- saying that half of the village killed other half of the village (which consisted of Polish people but with Jewish origins). This is incorrect as official sources indicate that only around 40 people were actually responsible. In the light of things which Daily Mail presented it gives a very bed impression of Poles and suggests they were a part of genocide, while in this particular example only a small group of Poles within that village were the perpetrators.

- another missing fact is that Daily Mail didn't mention anything about the presence of German (Nazi) police. If they mentioned that fact (which was officially established as true), then this would indicate to readers that mass murders which happened there were under the supervision and quite possibly influenced by Nazis. It is well known fact that Nazis had plenty of different ways in which they wanted to lie to people and use those lies as propaganda. It may be possible that Nazis actually ordered those killings or did it secretly, later using that tragedy as propaganda in which ""even Poles killed Jews"".

Whole story, presented in the light in which Daily Mail did, suggests to people that this homicide (or maybe even other homicides) were entirely committed by Polish people. This is very hurting for the whole nation, which has lost millions of its citizens (either of Jewish or Polish origin). Daily Mail article suggests that Poles were then antisemitic and if you look at the comments below the article on Daily Mail website, you can see that some people were under the impression that Poles not only were but still are antisemitic.",0,1386862578,null,0,false,0,ce00spl,t3_1spyzh,t1_ce00spl,t3_1spyzh,null,1428163047,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I agree, that's a big problem. It's going to depend on whether you regard encrypted data as something along the lines of disrupting a police investigation though...

&gt;This is true to a degree if due process has been followed, i.e the police need a damn good reason to look at the data, or you need to actually be charged with a crime and there's reason to believe the data is related to that crime; but RIPA brushes that due process aside.

I completely agree. That's why I don't like RIPA either.

&gt; Idealistically I still don't like really like that solution, but at least you'd be at the point where the average ""innocent until guilty"" citizen has some protection. If the police want these powers over people, they should have to work seriously hard for it at a case by case level. 

Unfortunately a dirty compromise might be the only solution in the situation we find ourselves in. 

&gt;There's also the possibility that you've lost or forgotten keys to ancient hard drive or flash drive. In which case you could go to jail for a potential crime. That seems all kind of wrong to me.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; You're suggesting that all travellers couldn't either list something they do themselves, or someone local who does?

I'm not suggesting - I'm still waiting for one to do so, even anecdotally (in a verifiable way),  after several discussions on reddit in the past few years. What did they do for children in need? What did they do for Red Nose day? For the other group (Britons generally), googling is easy, stats are available, so plenty of villages, town halls etc. can have their contributions easily verified (to the point of usually having a spot on TV when these things are on). And that's just telethons.

Tellingly, the response in the past has always been not 'this traveller/ gipsy group did X', it's always been to attack any *other* groups that; in this thread, this has now extended to 'prove anyone else in Britain does'.

&gt;What's the difference?

See above.

&gt;Neither of us know every traveller and every non traveller (or Scot) to make the accusations you are making.

Er...actually either of us can easily google to find charities from all over the UK that people from all corners contribute to. One of us is producing no evidence that travellers/ gypsies do the same (which as I pointed out is not new). When it's that one-sided, with no real evidence to the contrary, it's not really an accusation, it's an observation which you can't refute outside of 'prove other people do it!' which is a bit silly.

&gt;As for not knowing where communities of Scots might live, you are sort of proving one of my points about spotting patterns.

That depends on whether they define themselves as a community of scots, exclusive to any 'outsiders', or whether they're Britons that happen to be of Scottish descent but live in England - considering that's not normally necessary, why would I be looking for a pattern?

&gt;But if you were to wander through places like Carlisle, you'd find plenty of Scots.

...who aren't that different from other Britons in the sense of charity donations/ fundraising - for your example to really work, you'd have to show that they *don't* contribute anything to charities, etc. to differentiate them from a typical Briton.

Awesome, that'll make a big difference.

&gt; Those ecig estimates you got must be misinformation - I haven't paid a thing since I bought it and probably have refills for another month or two.

Fair enough. I had a look at various e-cig sites and they seemed to have roughly those figures. They may be expensive ones, not sure. If you're not currently buying any then it's entirely irrelevant to saving money, which means you can carry on :) However when you do start buying refills make a note of when &amp; how much it cost.

&gt; The phone can't be terminated (I'd have to pay the remainder of the contract in one go)

I thought that may be the case, I think that's worth sticking with then. I'd advise against changing the plan, that'll put you on another contract. I'd ditch the phone and get a dumb one, I did that a while ago and I was spending about £5/10 a month and the phone only cost £15. Worked brilliantly as a phone too. Also, if it gets dropped / scratched / lost it'll cost less to replace than the excess on a fancier phone.

&gt; Talking to the bank seems like a good idea, I had no idea they could help you out with things like that.

Yeah, it's partly a legal thing and it's also likely to be their best bet at actually getting their money back. 

&gt; If you can't pay off your overdraft or find yourself relying on it long-term, you may have financial difficulties. Speak to the bank about your options. The Lending Code says that the bank should treat you sympathetically. If you think your bank is not not doing this you can make a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

From: http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/debt_w/debt_borrowing_money_e/debt_types_of_borrowing_e/bank_overdrafts.htm

You should also go and talk to the citizens advice bureau http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice they'll be able to help with your options. 

I expect you may be able to turn the overdraft into a loan with agreed payments of a similar level to what you're paying now. Even at a 20% APR you could pay £20 a month and pay it off in 3 years. Then if you don't have an overdraft any more you can't have those fees.

&gt; I like the simple approach you're taking to this - it's ready clarified to me how silly little things add up and how much I can cut my expenses if I only put the effort in.

I'm glad it helps, it's surprising how much you can save by doing this. As you record all your income &amp; outgoings you'll start to see where the money is going or how much of a difference certain things make. This will make a huge difference to you as small changes (slightly cheaper bread, say, and not buying a paper [random examples]) could easily change you from *losing* money to *gaining* money. At the very least, having things quantified means you can properly weigh up different decisions, costs and benefits.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"Children in Need and Red Nose day, we know of small groups of people who did things, but the nation as a whole donated. We do not know how many of those were travellers. You may scoff and say ""None"" because that's your pre-conceived reality. But in truth, we don't know. What we do know is that travellers buy clothes, eat food, consume goods, buy fuel, so in that respect they support local communities. Travellers on legal campsites pay council tax, rent, gas. All going to support their local communities. Only the bad apples who camp on private land escape these responsibilities and sadly these are the ones we see time and time again. Individuals should be judged on their own merits, not on the merits of others.

&gt; For the other group (Britons generally), googling is easy, stats are available

Please point me towards the statistics showing how many donors were British born in permanent residence. I don't believe they exist to the level you're suggesting.

&gt; Er...actually either of us can easily google to find charities from all over the UK that people from all corners contribute to. 

Like above, how do you know who the donors are and what their background is? You're assuming all travellers walk around with a giant sign so if you see one you'd know. The truth is we don't.

*edit: I've just Googled and found three British registered charities openly run by travellers.

&gt; One of us is producing no evidence that travellers/ gypsies do the same

Can you provide the sort of evidence that you do the same? I've looked for a charity in your name (well your username) and can't see any. How can you prove that you are taking part in charity and contributing to your local area? You might be able to show receipts sure but you're comparing your receipts and knowledge of your personal life to ""what I can't find on Google""

&gt; for your example to really work, you'd have to show that they don't contribute anything to charities

That's not fair, why do I have to prove that Scots don't when you can't prove that travellers don't? You can't prove that something doesn't happen.

What we do know is that from your very limited experience, you have seen no evidence to suggest that travellers help their community. I can prove they pay council tax and rent on legal camp sites, and an FOI request from your local council may be able to show how much money the council actually receives from these sites.

There are many Brits who do not pay council tax, who live long term off benefits (I separate from people who are on temporarily or through illness). Why is a legal tax paying traveller a burden when someone willing to live off the government is not?

There are people who are good for this country and there are people who aren't. These two groups overlap many different communities, cities, age ranges, health levels.

""In the United Kingdom, prostitution itself (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal,[2] but a number of related activities, including soliciting in a public place, kerb crawling, owning or managing a brothel, pimping and pandering, are crimes.""

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7736436.stm

""The laws around prostitution in England and Wales are far from straight-forward. The act of prostitution is not in itself illegal - but a string of laws criminalises activities around it. Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, it is an offence to cause or incite prostitution or control it for personal gain. ""

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/22/suffolkmurders.ukcrime5

""Strictly speaking, prostitution has always been legal in the UK, in the sense that it is not illegal to pay for sex, or to receive money for it. But many of the activities that it involves - including soliciting, kerb-crawling, pimping, and keeping a brothel - are all against the law.

In practice, much depends on interpretation and enforcement. Campaigners argue that Asbos, for example, are frequently used against sex workers, outside of prostitution legislation.""",0,1386864159,null,0,false,0,ce01ew0,t3_1sn2ig,t1_ce01ew0,t1_ce01bwb,null,1428162759,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Other jobs which are services rather than careers are things like being a doctor/nurse/soldier. In the first two I'd say the majority of people *who feel a call* to service do it because they want to help people.

In terms of joining the forces the reasons may be a bit more abstract, such as protecting the country that nurtured you, going on a learning curve with regards to confidence and leadership, opportunities to visit exotic destinations even. But for all of these you get to see your rewards first hand, in the short term.

Why would someone go for a poorly paid job running something as stressful as a country which requires the hours that a minister puts in everyday and the public scrutiny on television and in the newspapers? They'd have to feel called to it. Probably they want to sort out the country or keep it running on it's current track. The problem with that is that making changes on a whole countrywide basis is going to take a long time. If that is your reward then in the short term you're going to hate your job. You're not going to perform as well as you would otherwise.

I mean, at least show her moping around about how her long lost love was turned inside out. Such a pity because I really liked the actress and thought the character had a lot of potential.

2) Sleeper MVP of the season is Handsome Barman Alex. Loved the craziness of him getting bullied into fucking the flying guy's power out of him. Pretty much loved his character this whole season -- in the fourth season I never would have pegged him as a comedic highlight, but Matt Stokoe really did some great work. 

3) Joe GilgOWNED. As always, he was the emotional and comedic highlight of the finale. His tearful reunion with Rudy 2 was some fantastic stuff.

The team is completely different from when Harry left, these players aren't being asked to adapt to a style of play, they're having to create it. 

I think a much more realistic view comes from the british cycling coach who spoke about ""The aggregation of marginal gains"". At the moment, the team naturally have a lot of area's we can improve 1 or 2% as any group of strangers would a few months after being put together. From learning the language, to  understanding of each others movement, to arguably most importantly, feeling comfortable and confident. United have the same players that won the league last season, but without sir Alex and his coaching staff, a lot of those 1 - 2%s that they brought are gone and look at the impact that has.

This team is young and will grow together, if we don't get champions league, we're not going to lose anyone, we have a great stable base put in place and I have high hopes for next season.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;We do not know how many of those were travellers.

So lots and lots of travellers may have been involved, but not one of them was as a group, anywhere. Does that sound like travellers to you?

&gt;because that's your pre-conceived reality

Sure, it must be than and not a complete lack of evidence. I hadn't really considered it until I noticed people complaining but not actually giving any examples, at which point I started asking. The best (and only) one I've had so far is someone that knew a traveller that helped someone elderly with their shopping.

&gt;What we do know is that travellers buy clothes, eat food, consume goods, buy fuel, so in that respect they support local communities

Err...that's actually almost everyone. For travellers, with their eagerness to be identified as their own, seperate group, why do they not make a point of donating or raising money as (say) the travellers of Essex or similar? I mean, why suddenly so coy when doing something good?

&gt;Can you provide the sort of evidence that you do the same?

Easily - personally, as part of my local area and as part of my Wife's home town. But we're not talking about just *anyone* providing proof (because that's actually quite easy), we're talking about travellers/ gypsies.

&gt; I've looked for a charity in your name (well your username) and can't see any.

Why would that be? And as you're asking this question...you did read the part where I mentioned 'preferring to insist that nobody else does instead of providing any evidence that they do', right?

&gt;How can you prove that you are taking part in charity and contributing to your local area?

You're not thinking big enough. Not only do I raise money for or donate to local and national charities, I'm also part of a charity [that does work overseas](http://msavlc.co.uk/). But again, we're now down to you demanding evidence for me personally when you haven't actually gotten around to providing any *for an entire group*.

&gt;You might be able to show receipts sure but you're comparing your receipts and knowledge of your personal life to ""what I can't find on Google""

No, I'm giving you examples like the one above, because charities like that get reported on in the news/ on reddit/ etc. and as a byproduct so do the people doing the charity work. I can provide photos of the stuff we built abroad, and the people we've helped. So considering it's so easy to find charities set up by all sorts of groups, finding gypsy charity raising news should be easy, I mean *someone* would have mentioned it by now, yes?

&gt;That's not fair, why do I have to prove that Scots don't when you can't prove that travellers don't?

Because there are plenty of news reports and searchable articles on the subject based in that location. Go google 'Carlilse, Scots, Charity'. It appears that you don't want to look for proof for your own example, I guess because it means your next search would have to be for....

&gt;What we do know is that from your very limited experience

So a complete lack of news articles, or even anecdotal evidence is not significant - it's *limited experience*. Righto.

&gt;you have seen no evidence to suggest that travellers help their community

Not quite - *nobody has provided any*. And helping the community could be (for example) helping an old lady with her shopping. I'm more curious about the apparent lack of travellers seriously helping *any* community in a charitable or fundraising sense, and so would like to see examples to the contrary. You're just the latest to not do so.

&gt;I can prove they pay council tax and rent on legal camp sites

Well, I'm pretty sure that's a legal requirement.

&gt;Why is a legal tax paying traveller a burden when someone willing to live off the government is not?

I wasn't aware the discussion was covering this. All I asked was for evidence of charitable fundraising or contributions, and so far you've gone down the same road I mentioned before; attack, blame others, anything other than provide real evidence. I think you've now done that at least twice.

&gt;There are people who are good for this country and there are people who aren't.

Indeed, some apparently donate to charity/ raise funds/ help people who have no connection to them at all. And some apparently don't.

&gt;It's not fair to single out travellers as a burden on the community when the burdens are far more intermingled in society.

How did we get from 'please provide examples of Traveller/ Gispy fundraising' to 'It's not fair to single out travellers as a burden'?

&gt; ""Gay Holocaust"" survivors could be re-imprisoned for ""repeat offences"", and were kept on the modern lists of ""sex offenders"". Under the Allied Military Government of Germany, some homosexuals were forced to serve out their terms of imprisonment, regardless of the time spent in concentration camps.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"&gt; Does that sound like travellers to you?

This is you taking your own prejudice and assuming you're correct because the alternative doesn't fit into your belief system so it must be true. To answer, yes that sounds like a human thing to do and I refuse to lump all travellers together the way you have and assume they all don't while everyone else does.

You've openly used a lack of evidence as evidence itself which is a dangerous way to go. You're waiting for evidence to come to you (or google) rather than actually looking for it in an unbiased way.

&gt; why do they not make a point of donating or raising money as (say) the travellers of Essex or similar

Because that's not how travellers work, there is no ""travellers of Essex"", individuals and families mingle and split all the time. Where is your donation for xyz street residents charitable organisation?

&gt; You're not thinking big enough. Not only do I raise money for or donate to local and national charities, I'm also part of a charity that does work overseas.

No you're not thinking big enough, how do you know that not a single traveller does exactly the same? If there is no Google evidence that you do it, perhaps the same applies to other people. Not everyone's financial history is freely available online. You've made an assumption and using the gaps knowledge as affirmation of your own beliefs again.

&gt; So a complete lack of news articles, or even anecdotal evidence is not significant

We don't know who belongs, runs or donates to most charities. Just because it's not stamped ""run by travellers"" it's not right to assume it's run by bricks and mortar men in suits. There are traveller-run registered charities. Just because you can't find them, it doesn't mean they don't exist.

&gt; And helping the community could be (for example) helping an old lady with her shopping.

I can imagine the headline now in one of the national news papers... you won't find that for obvious reasons, an individual helping another individual. [This site](http://www.grtleeds.co.uk/) might open your eyes about how human beings can cooperate and help their local communities, even travellers. I can also find traveller-run schools online which surely must fall into your high expectations. Though I still stand by my claim that your expectations for travellers seems somewhat higher than your fellow settler.

I can of course only show you some of the larger contributions, as smaller charitable acts like helping people cross a road are not televised. I used to work in Quasar in Hemel and we had a couple of traveller kids kill time in the evenings. Yeah they were a handful at times but they chipped in with some of the clean up work. Not proof per ce, but none exists of the small acts. 

The thing is that because they're individual human beings and don't judge an entire people on the actions of a few.

The truth remains, you do not know any travellers, you are acting on limited experience from yourself and people around you which is not a fair or even cross section of the traveller community. Maybe no evidence exists that a traveller has returned a dropped handbag or helped someone cross the road, this stuff doesn't make the news and isn't documented, it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. The bad members of the travelling community we notice, we see, hear and sometimes smell them as they cause trouble. But the same can be said for a local high street on a Saturday night and a number of settler communities which are known for drugs, violence and regular police presence. The fact is that good settlers are visible. Good travellers tend to be invisible by definition.",0,1386867311,null,0,1386869005,0,ce02q9g,t3_1smgi4,t1_ce02q9g,t1_ce024cn,null,1428162145,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Arsenal-They are winning the league now and I respect that they are good, but I'm not giving them the nod until they play City and Chelsea.  Ramsey seems to be coming down from his once-in-a-lifetime form and I can't see them continuing to perform so well.

Liverpool-They've surprised me, but their midfield is weak and when Coutinho gets hurt (which happens a lot), they don't look as dangerous.  Also, if they lose Suarez, they become a mid table team regardless of who they ""replace"" him with.

Chelsea-Immensely talented, but they just keep dropping points to bad teams.  I expect them to spend on a striker and eventually talent will prevail, so I feel pretty confident that they'll be in CL.

City-They are the most talented team in the league.  If they can figure out how to play even remotely well away from the Ethiad, they'll win the title.

Everton-I like seeing them do well because they're not a big spending club, but I feel like they'll eventually drift into their usual spot around 6-7.  They just draw too many games.

United-I watch almost all of their games because my roommate is a fan and I'm telling you that they are not that good.  I guess it speaks to how good Furgeson was because he won the league by a mile last year with a team that was probably 3rd best talent wise.  I expect them to pick it up eventually, but their central midfield is pathetic and their fullbacks aren't much better.

As for strikers, considering 1) our history of failing to add goalscorers (at ANY position) in the January window, 2) our glacier-like speed at which we buy strikers, and 3) the fact we just spunked out 26mil on Soldado...I'd say the chances of us adding a quality, scoring forward in January are pretty slim. Perhaps Aston Villa sees themselves firmly planted in mid-table come end of January and decides to dump Benteke, but as Benteke's stock has continued to rise since we failed in our attempts to get him over the summer, I would imagine that the player himself is holding out for some of the big-money clubs to swoop in. 

Any other forward outside of an absolutely in-form, young striker seems like it would be a waste considering the prices commanded in that window - might as well wait until reduced prices in the summer unless you guarantee goals.

He is an advanced playmaker, surely he would be the best player in the Championship.  Our biggest problem this year?  Scoring goals, I have absolutely no doubt his presence would alleviate that.

His work ethic, attitude is the main concern and I'm sure Harry wouldn't play him if he thought he was going to be a detriment to the team.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;Then he gets a punishment if not the proper one.

People should only be punished for crimes for which they have been found guilty. If we lose this principle for paedophiles or terrorists, then we've lost it for everybody.

Sentencing isn't only about punishment. It's also about rehabilitation and protecting the public. Giving the paedophile a short sentence for an unrelated crime doesn't allow for rehabilitation, and crucially in the absence of the sex offenders' register doesn't protect the public. 

Instead of going for the easy win of RIPA, it would be better for the police to continue their investigations and prosecute when they have actual evidence. 

&gt;But it does provide a method of distinguishing the real criminals from the non-criminals. I.e. if the police want to read my encrypted files (not that I have any). The can go for it.

Supposing your encrypted files contained bids for contracts, or journalistic interviews where you were under an obligation not to reveal your sources, or information gathered as a whistleblower in a government department where the law was being broken? You might decide it was worth risking jail.

And even if you were a real criminal, it provides no evidence of what you've been up to. 

&gt;I think it should require a court order, and I have repeated this so many times I'm getting bored of saying it: I do not think RIPA is perfect, but the motivation behind it speaks of the dilemma: how do we catch digital crimes without being unacceptably authoritarian?

A court order would be a useful safeguard, as would conviction being beyond reasonable doubt rather than balance of probabilities. 

It doesn't eliminate the fundamental problem though: if you've got something to hide that's sufficiently illegal, you have every incentive to refuse to hand over your encryption keys. The only way of fixing this would be to make the term for losing your encryption  keys something in the region of 20 years. 

&gt;I don't think that the response, as the majority here seem to believe, is to just say ""privacy is sacred, they can never ever look at my files"".

It's an intractable problem. There's no good answer. In the absence of a sufficiently good answer I think it's prefectly reasonable to fall back on  ""privacy is sacred"".",0,1386873404,null,0,false,0,ce05g2k,t3_1snugj,t1_ce05g2k,t1_cdzz0z9,null,1428160877,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The PIRA had a dedicated Finance department responsible for sourcing weapons and logistics for use in the North - they paid for this through robberies, donations, drugs and other unscrupulous behaviour. 

They remained a department throughout their campaign, so they must have been relatively good at their job. Their impact was not minimal. Brendan O'Brien's book deals with each of the departments, including finance and it's area of responsability.

&gt; IF they were selling drugs, they obviously weren't selling them very well. 

DAAD was their tax collector/enforcer in the North, same as RAAD are for OnH. Why sell when you can tax? Good profits, none of the risk. Also the added bonus of being ""anti-drugs"" among the local community for those who don't pay to play. 

Dublin Brigade PIRA were/are effectively drug dealers primarily. A 5k cash haul from a post office can be tripled when used to purchase drugs through the same supply routes as weaponry. The added bonus of this was that Northern Command were not responsible for finance within the theatre, and didn't become known to the locals as pushers, as well as not compromising volunteers and massively exposing them to risk.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"This is amusing.

I love your arguments. An entire boat load of false comparisons and non sequtiors. 

sigh.. let's start with this:

Gibraltar was acquired at the Treaty of Utrecht to control the straits. This is historical fact dude, I mean sure, it was part of the whole grand bargain between the League of Augsburg and the France/Spain which ended the War of Spanish Succession. This is history. 

Now you can bitch about some of it being on Wiki, and I could go an a massive detour on the connections between the War of Spanish Succession, the League of Augsburg and the ""Glorious Revolution"" of 1688 . But I won't because that wouldn't be fair play - especially when we throw in the whole question of Spain's declining influence /lose of naval power and the power of France under Louis Quatorze, the Sun King. 

Anyhow... so let's say this again and at the same time deal with you silly little false comparison. Gib is place ACQUIRED  from another country to park warships. Portsmouth and Yorkshire have always been part of the territorial waters of England, and Glasgow of Scotland (though the Union didn't exist the Scottish Kingdom and England had the same person as king - though the whole Jacobite rebellion thing kept this a bit more fluid and interesting) 

The rest of this is quite hilariously bad. 

First of all let's list all the things I haven't argued which you seem to have decided I have: 

a) Tax evasion/avoidance in X country is fine by me, but Gib isn't. Nope.. never argued that. 
b) banning speech or ""hate speech"" is right.... nope never argued that either. You can call me lots of names, I can tell you to sod off. I actually think the ""hate speech"" thing is overdone and unevenly applied. 
c)  I haven't argue that places like Yorkshire and others AREN'T dependent on the state... only that GIB is and you're a hypocrit for the whining about the rest of the country/people being in receipt of it if you're from there. The same applies to Tykes like Eric Pickles who want to ""slim down the state"" or that moron Bloom or whatever from the UKIP. 
d) That Gibraltarian is a racial category. Nope, never argued that. You're a person who comes from a country that has it's own teleology and socio-historical trends. You just seem to be obsessed defending your right to have them and then beating people round the head for having the temerity to have their own- again the charge is hypocracy and lack of self-awareness. Simples. Do I think you're lending succour to racists and Islamophobes? Yep. I'll get to that. 

First - i want to deal with this because it will help later: 
&gt;closed minded Little Englanders such as yourself
and 
&gt;I love Brits who have never been to the Middle East who think it's some Arabian Nights utopia.

I spent a about 8 years of my life travelling for work, a lot of that time in the Gulf. I also lived in South Africa, travelled a lot of specially interesting places. I'm not going to be able to convince you on a public forum unless you've been there - but if you've worked in Dubai then I'll simply say, when I first went Diera was the place to get your hotel ..and now you want to get your hotel the other side of the Creek, also never get stuck in traffic near the Clock Tower. If you've been then you'll know I'm not making it up. 

I also specialised in a degree in the history of the region at a Russell group Uni. My ear also picks up Arabic quite well, though I'm rusty these days in terms of speaking it. 

So , yeah.. I'm not that little Englander who knows nothing about the M.E or world travel. It's where I worked and also an area I studied. I also know my way round Islamic law. 

Now that that's out of the way, and it kind of destroys a lot of your post. Let us return to some points I want to address. Let's start with your lack of self awareness. 

Have you noticed how angry you are about the fact I questioned your citizenship? I mean you're livid. You're upset that I have cast aspersions on your country of origin and you current status/rights.

This is the tone you set here, correct?

&gt;"" don't go into some ill-informed Wikipedia-fuelled tirade about how being from Gibraltar means I'm not allowed an opinion, or how even though I'm a British citizen I should feel like an immigrant in the UK.""
and: 

&gt;That's not what I'm implying at all; you kept saying words like ""our Navy"", ""keeping your special relationship with us"" like they were separate ""us and them"" entities. Gibraltar is British, I'm a British citizen just like you""

Here you celebrate your Gibraltarian culture:

&gt;Gibraltarian culture is pretty strong and entirely unique to British culture, which is pretty sexy considering our size, we even have our own language! 

You even go on to say this  to defend that right:
&gt;but if any past British colonial influence means you don't have your own culture then someone should tell India, China and Africa (oh and why not throw America in there) to stop celebrating theirs.

So, if from this you're proud of you're Gibraltarian heritage, you HATE being treated like an immigrant even though you admitted that you came here and ""integrated"" because you consider yourself a citizen REGARDLESS. 

Then you go do this: 

&gt;just because of some angry second-generation Pakistanis

but hang on , you yourself are a British citizen,, you're demanding to be called British, you're arguing with me because you're British.. this guys are also British... why the difference? 

Why does a second generation Pakistani born here have different rights than you? 

You seem to put great stock in the military service. Me, I did the RAF for a little while, my grandfather was RAF, my uncle fought with Slim's Burma Army. 

But you're talking about ""second Generation Pakistanis"". No military history or connection to Britain at tall there right?

This is why I have a problem with you. You seem to come out with the most ridiculous regurgitations of internet based trash to justify positions that should fall apart under your own logic. 

British Pakistanis/Nigerians are no different from YOU and yet you continue to give succour to half the pseudo racist arguments peddled by people are the ""little englanders"" you complain about. You whole heartedly adopt anger and hatred people who probably have more in common with yourself than stupid term ""indegenous"" Brit.

true,[deleted],null,null,"After reading the article, I felt I largely agreed with it, but the counter argument article just left me confused.

From the counter argument I learned precisely one thing - apparently a lot of rape porn is presented in such a way that you can't tell it from the real deal. I'm not sure why this would benefit most from a blanket ban though, surely a requirement that rape porn scenes (or for that matter, lets just say all porn) must be prefaced by a section in which all actors give consent to the camera so there can be absolutely no confusion in the matter. Surely that would solve the problem?

The rest was just bewildering. After asserting that we were all misled about what the change to the law aims to do she didn't really fully clarify what this change was, or really why it was they were pushing for it.

There was a weird distinction made between BDSM and rape porn/fantasies (which was repeated in one linked article while another seemingly condemned BDSM porn as a whole) which read like someone trying to present themselves as a sexually or socially liberal person without really understanding either of the concepts they were discussing. The article (seemingly) dismissing BDSM as a whole was even worse - the author used her own lack of understanding of why women would ever want to be subs as a reason to assume it was innately bad to want such a thing, and then suggested that rape porn didn't depict the fantasy of being raped but a rapist fantasy. Now, I'm not going to deny that some of the stuff out there is probably harmful, but I think I can safely say that if you can't wrap your head around the idea that someone who is sexually submissive isn't necessarily meek in reality, then you might not be the best person to pass comment on who has what fantasy.

There were the traditional 'rapists watch rape porn' figures, but to anyone with half a brain that shouldn't come as a surprise, and anyone with a basic knowledge of correlation and causation would be able to see why their numbers are meaningless. If they had any decent statistics showing a causative link, I'd be forced to reconsider my position, but as is always the case, they do not. 

There was one link which was mostly figures, but it didn't really state what the goal, or proposed changes to the law were. There were a few things like that - several of the articles actually contradicted each other, and I was left confused whether they were wanting to ban porn depicted as rape, all porn with rape scenes whether it was explicitly acknowledged as a fantasy or not, or all porn which could be thought of as rape. 

Honestly, if they just cleared this up then maybe people wouldn't be so worried, but its the fact that people raise concerns over the issue, and those concerns are ignored while they bring up issues largely irrelevant to those concerns.",0,1386877969,null,0,false,0,ce07jo9,t3_1sq5dc,t1_ce07jo9,t3_1sq5dc,null,1428159826,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The Angels are supposed to send the Doctor to Trenzalore. They do, but in the process, also send him back in time, absorbing a shitload of energy by stealing his remaining years.

He manages to contact Clara through time, and talk her through bringing the TARDIS to meet him, but something prevents her from being able to bring it to the exact right time. Meanwhile, all these enemies are everywhere, trying to destroy him before the moment when they know he's going to regenerate (because something else is going to happen too). Maybe they know he wants to bring back Gallifrey and have a reason not to want that to happen. Personally, I think this is the case, possibly because the Valeyard will come along with him.

So she arrives only a short while before she left. Meaning the Doctor is dying of old age right as she arrives, after spending hundreds and hundreds of years being hunted.

And as he regenerates, he finds out why the limit is twelve. Because after that, you risk something else coming back with you... a manifestation of your basest desires with all of your cunning but none of your restraint... an evil being, your equal in every way but morally.

And suddenly, as much as they're angry at the Doctor for what he's unleashed, punishing him ceases to be their priority.

So the Doctor, and the Silence, and the Daleks, and the Cybermen, and even the Weeping Angels if any of them are present, are all terrified. The still recovering Twelfth Doctor (Capaldi) is forced out the door of the TARDIS. The door slams shut behind him.

Inside the TARDIS, we see a young, rejuvenated Matt Smith, smiling at the console, but not that same friendly smile we know. Something's off. He flips a few switches and pulls a lever.

Outside the TARDIS, the Doctor, Clara, and all the others look on in horror as it starts to disappear. Cut back inside to Matt Smith, also known as the Valeyard.

""Geronimo.""

And then a more sinister version of ""I Am the Doctor"" plays.

Cliffhanger where we know that at the beginning of the next season, the Doctor has to rely on the technology of his enemies to travel through time and space in an attempt to defeat the Valeyard and recover his TARDIS.",0,1386878497,null,0,false,0,ce07snt,t3_1sn25p,t1_ce07snt,t3_1sn25p,null,1428159710,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Trail commission is a large revenue stream for providers such as HL and allows them to offer discounted or free trading and account maintenance and cross-subsidises other areas of the business such as equity trading.

As it is an industry wide change, many brokers are changing their pricing structure.  You do benefit from a transparent pricing structure and reduced TER on the clean classes.  However, lots of brokers are introducing or raising charges for custody and maintenance and it's upsetting a lot of passive investors who are use to paying very little for their accounts.  If you do plan on moving, make sure the broker is RDR compliant and remember that charges are still likely to change as brokers adjust to a post-RDR world.

As an alternative, you could look at holding an equivalent ETF or IT with a broker who only deals with equity trading.

I suspect what the lady/gent was asking this because students doing some courses could be eligible for financial aid via scholarships etc through companies in related industries. That or they had another idea.

The maintenance loan you get goes right into your account, the tuition is the only one which doesn't. You can spend it how you like but like you said it is for rent and sometimes doesn't cover the whole amount, see my next point.

Another point i would add is that uni halls tend to be much more than the price of private rented accommodation. At my uni i rented privately from the first year onwards and paid around £85 rent p/week all inclusive while for the same thing in halls i had friends paying about £120. I strongly suggest looking into them.

I would also learn to cook, even it is in basic things. There is no bigger drain on money than either buying ready meals or fast food. You could easily make a weeks worth of soup and buy some bread for the side for the same as one takeaway.

I went to Leeds recently.

I went because my wife had a conference there and I decided to spend the day with my son to discover the city.

We did grocery shopping from a local Teso for ~ £80. We went to the Arts Gallery and donated £8. We went to the retail centre and bought clothes for my son for nearly £150. We had a coffee from a costa in the centre for ~ £15.

We wanted to have lunch at the Pizza Express in the centre with my wife. Parking was a nightmare but I paid onstreet parking for 1.5 hours at an extortionate price (I think I paid £5 or something like that?).

Lunch at Pizza Express was nice, we decided to go for a desert even though I risked overstaying on the car parking ticket. We ended up indeed overstaying by literally 5 minutes. Bad decision i know, my fault yaddy yadda...

You guessed it, some smug absolutely sniped us and I found a £25 ticket in there - ""overstaying"".

So, I went home, copied all the receipts from our day shopping, all in all amounting to nearly £400. I formed together a letter, and I sent it to the local council + pizza express + local costa + local tourism office + all of the places we visited (11 letters). + I put in a cheque for the fucking £25.

-Lamela showed some flashes of what we're expecting from him, but IMO he still has a bit to go before he can really earn a starting spot.

-Good to see some goals from Soldado, confidence boosting for sure.

-Holtby continues a strong run of form.

-Fredericks had a perfect debut here. Great things to come.

-Need to get Dembele in against Liverpool. Absolute class.

-All in all, this game was exactly what we needed. Everyone says we need more time to gel, but then laments when we play a ""strong"" Europa lineup. This game showed exactly why this competition has value for us. While it may have been against a relegation Russian side about to go on holiday, we were able to get Eriksen and Rose some time on the pitch, and Soldado got the monkey off his back.   Hopefully some of this positivity translates into the Liverpool match.

* Stop tidying up rivers so much. Due to the requirement for everything to be uniform and clean we have removed a huge amount of structural complexity from our rivers and streams which changes flow rates and patterns. As a result water is getting through out rivers a lot faster so when it rains the water is not spread out throughout the river but instead rushes through all at once.

* Promote the development of riparian (river edge) habitats: I'm not saying we should cover the banks of the Thames in trees but when earth banks are being build up they should always be planted with trees or other vegetation. This again retains water when it rains and reduces run off.

* Stop blocking up wetlands or expand existing ones: This is a big one, they are specifically designed to flood during high rainfall events and to soak up water.

As far as Lennon having the right side sewn up, I'd say it depends on opposition, and who you're playing on the left.

It's Pelle's first year, give it time, and the youth will come in. He is under a lot of pressure to succeed right away and right now cannot risk integrating the youth into the first team. 

I think it was the same with Mancini. He was the manager that gave the most first team debuts to our youth players out of any City manager in the premier league era. However he was unable to give them an extended run in the team because he was under so much pressure to win trophies. 

I also agree with you on the fact that Mancini spoke his mind to the press. While not always the right decision, he always answered the questions given to him. Whereas you watch interviews with Pellegrini, he gives no answers to controversial topics such as other manager's comments and FIFA corruption. When asked he simply says he has no comment. This is the type of manager the owners want. Someone who isn't controversial and who won't attract headlines for the wrong reasons. Someone ""Holistic"".

I think it's more that we've heard so often that Bobby is lacking confidence, that he can't find the net, that he's a flop, that when he comes out like he did today, gets service, he puts them in the net, simple as that.

Yes, Defoe's done that all year in the Europa League. But the fact remains that Bobby is a better striker, and we need to get him scoring.

 Remember the goal drought he had last year?

The lords, if it continues to exist, should be appointed based on someone having expertise which would held contribute to the debate. If we should have scientists and businessmen, doctors and philosophers, actors and town planners: whoever they are, if they've demonstrated success, great experience and carefully gleaned expertise in the field in which they work they should be appointed to the Lords. Kind of like MBEs are given out these days; 'for services to X industry' except preferably less skewed towards celebrities than MBEs and OBEs are. At that point you'd hopefully start to lose any idea that Lords are us v them because any one of use could be Lord if we achieve a lot and gain expertise. You'd have posh rich businessmen next to the most working class person you can conceive of and both would have something to contribute at some point because both would be experts in something and when their expertise would be needed they would step up and contribute.

I live in a town that still has a busy town centre and while that might be down to it having a fortuitous design with good affordable central parking options it's more likely to do with the councils repeated refusal to allow the building of a large supermarket in the town.

The nearest large supermarket is less than 6 miles or so up a fast road but it seems to make enough of a difference that people are willing to stay within the town to do their shopping.  There is a medium sized supermarket for the average grocery shopping but it seems to be at balance with a number of independent bakers, butchers etc.  

Shop rents are high and the population are largely reasonably well off, lots of disposable income in the area due to the proximity to a nearby city which makes a difference I suppose.  There's apparently enough of a demand for galleries, whisky shops, music shops and restaurants etc to keep them afloat.

There's also a sort of attitude that the town is better than to allow it's nice town centre to go to the dogs, the town has history and character and a large part of that is because there's people who want to live, work and shop there.  

I certainly pay a premium to live in the town centre but it's worth it to me, I like the town and if it means paying high rent and not being able to save a few quid by shopping at asda when I want bread and milk then so be it - i'll pop down to the adequate co-op instead and likely walk past a shop selling something interesting.",0,1386895553,null,0,false,0,ce0fmsd,t3_1spul4,t1_ce0fmsd,t3_1spul4,null,1428155964,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On the one hand I can see where you are coming from, it shouldn't be representative in the same was as the House of Commons, for a start it would then become as susceptible to the influence of money and the media as the Commons which kind of negates one of the major benefits of having a House of Lords.

But at the same time having an appointed house means it can easily become rife with nepotism, people who have gone to the right schools, know the right people, etc. Which is just maintaining the same class relations but getting rid of the ""lords"" in name only. So how do you think we could protect it from becoming that, direct democracy is one solution that is often suggested to deal with the oligarchical tendenices of organisations, what other solutions are there? 

What you are proposing could work in theory but it still requires a big change, how do you make sure that the people being appointed to Lords are being appointed by merit. At the moment MBEs, OBEs, cushty board positions, etc are all arguably given out based on personal relations rather than merit.

Of course the worst case scenario of having it open to election is ending up with a bunch of idiots who know nothing (a bit like the House of Commons hoho) and all you could do to combat that is look at the thigns that traditionally are supposed to encourage a well informed and interested electorate such as limits on the donations candidates can recieve, limits on the amount of money that can be spent on campaigning, improve education, more refenerndums, more accountability of elected officials, etc.

I think maybe you are being optimistic.

true,jamesdownwell,null,null,"This question comes up on the British subreddits from time to time and downvoting definitely suggests large support for the monarchy. 

My personal opinion is that a move to a republic would be better for society in general and do wonders for the ingrained perception that the upper classes are intrinsically 'better' than the masses. I also like the idea that any child born in the UK could have the dream of being the Head of State and a figurehead for the country, which is unfortunately not the case now. 

I would never dream of replacing Elizabeth right now as I think she has been an exemplary Head of State and I can't think of anyone that could come close, Royal or otherwise. That leads us to the potential problem of Charles who has been known to get involved in things he really shouldn't. 

There are a few misconceptions that people throw around such as ""President Blair or Thatcher"" which ignores the fact that many republics are not Presidental like France or USA. We only have to look to our Irish neighbours to see that. Another is the strange idea that a move to a Republic will somehow instil a collective historical amnesia or ""breaking tradition"". Alfred, Æthelstan, Elizabeth I, Robert Bruce, James VI &amp; I and Victoria won't be erased from history just as the French can remember their kings of old. 

I actually live in a Republic and while it's not perfect, it certainly creates a distinct level of fairness in society and it's link to the nation which is absent from the British psyche.

true,skinnyhulk,eng-kent,Kent,"Having dealt with goats for both conservation and for meat, the other issues would be 

* Larger vegetation would still need to be removed manually

* Goats (contrary to popular opinion) are very fussy over what they eat 

* Access to water

* Biosecurity a lot of rail is very close to agricultural land

* Safety of Stockperson

* Stocking density:- this is the main spanner in the works, judging by the amount of current vegetation by railway tracks in West Kent, it would require a very low density of goats approx 6 per Ha, however  [London Alone](http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=7843) has 4000 Ha of railtrack and network rail manages [30,000 hectares](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/1034.aspx) of railtrack vegetation. So 6 *30,000=180,000 goats required just to meet a mimimal stocking density.  but a density of nearer 12 per hectare would be better to remove the vegetation. But I shall go with minimal density for simpler maths

There are approx [80,000 goats in the uk currently](http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/vetsurveillance/species/goats.htm) so we would have to more than double the number of goats in the UK.

Now because goats are rather  sociable little fuckers they will all tend to bunch up so how do you keep them reasonably far apart over large distances? Answer you can't. Now if we are to assume we use the rather unpopular version of stake and chain the goats that would require approximately 180,0000metres of chain just to keep each goat staked to the ground within a 10 metre radius, it would also require 180,000 water troughs and 180,000 stakes to be driven into the ground. Now what would happen if a goat came loose of its stake and the chain ended up laid across the track.

Now we come to my final point, on average in an agricultural setting it requires an experienced stock person to look after the goats. Fair enough you may say... BUT one stockperson in a farming setting can only suitably look after approx 600 goats in various fields assuming a SMD (Standard Man Day) 8-6 O'clock and with a vehicle.

**Assuming the chain method**

 Now said stock person won't be driving a train around at 1/2 mph, so that person has to walk.  600 goats, 10 metres apart equates to  6km of walking or twelve total, but that does not include any supplementary feeding in the winter that is just a ""hello goat"" and off to the next one. So after a week each goat will have to be moved further up the line which means each goat must be untied and moved, I wont even bother to calculate the amount of time required  to undo and move 600 goats.


**Assuming the standard ""free roam method""**

Still requires one stock person for 600 goats but for that person to adequately check all 600 are alive would probably require walking about 10 km minimum (goats are very active) and water stations would need to be placed far enough apart that the goats would not congregate in one area 1 goat may not derail a train but I bet 600 would fuck it up.

**Part 2**
 But I haven't addressed stocking density yet with my figures, well
assuming we follow that each side of the track is 10metres then the length of track needed to meet a stocking density of 6 per Ha  (10000m^2 ) we need 6 goats for every 500 metres, which means that for the stockperson to check 600 goats he/she would need to walk 50km to check them and a further 50km back totalling 100km or 62miles.

This to cover the area of network rail would require 300 experienced stock people to check the animals. 
But ain't noway anyone is gonna walk that amount of miles perday so lets drop it to 10 miles or 16 km. That now requires us to have 1875 stock persons to check said goats
Wages would have to be at least £20,000 due to the added danger of working around railway lines and a management structure put in. So just for stock staff it now costs £37,500,000. Now assuming we can buy all 180,000 goats today at todays price [£130 each](http://www.ukgoats.co.uk/sale2.html#bou) that equates to approx £23,400,000 and that does not account for the price rise that would occur due to a purchase of that size.

Hay and feed cost per goat per year work out to roughly £45 quid (basing this on my own costings for about 300 of the fuckers and growing my own hay) 

Typically a good replacement rate for livestock is from 5-15% but I think it is safe to assume a 25% replacement rate for railways, that increases the annual cost by £5,850,000

£8,100,000 per annum for feed
£37,500,000 per annum for stock persons
£5,850,000 for replacements
Sub total
£51,450,000 per annum

Total for first year not including replacements 
**£69,000,000**
and has not included management structure vet bills, increased replacements or employer expenses neither employee expenses, nor associated costs with complying with regulations on keeping livestock.  


Network rails current maintenance costs for all railway maintenance are
£2,467million. However I cannot find any figures specifically for vegetation removal.

true,maybelying,null,null,"Rory did live a nice long life, though.  The paradox didn't wipe out the fixed point of his death, because the paradox was that he died before that fixed point occurred.  The paradox wiped out the angels and their operation because they couldn't handle the energy it created.

The doctor can visit his past companions, but even with ten's farewell tour, he didn't visit them in their own past - the exception being Rose, which he really shouldn't have done but didn't care, because that was the only way he could revisit her.  It's part of the same reason timelords aren't supposed to revisit their own timeline;  they can, but it can carry consequences.  Every time the Doctor revisits someone connected to him, it is from a future point from where they last interacted with him.  And knowledge of their death creates a new fixed point for him.  He has never revisited a companion that has died.

I'll agree that it was a bit of a lazy ending, but it fits within the canon that has been established.  Besides, there has to be some limits to what a time traveler can do otherwise each story would just the protagonist using time travel to keep repeating an action until they have the outcome they want.  The Blinovitch Limitation Effect is one of the barriers the writers created a while back, it's a bit of an ambiguous universal principle that prevents time travelers from being able to repeatedly visit the same point in space-time.

1) Rape Complaint from the female who is prepared to attend court, rare in itself.
2) Sleeping ""victim""
3) Video evidence and a cocky defendant.

You argue an unconventional point - that the Police play judge and jury. This is an uncommon point of view to be held by a member of the public. I'd hazard a guess (based on a decade of experience) that had this been binned by the police there was an equal chance the victim would be pictured next to the headline ""raped on CCTV, police did nothing"".

Personally I think this defendant is full of shit, but I don't have the case paperwork and the messages sent between victim and suspect; my inherent mistrust of everyone and cynicism also factors in.

However it is for the above damned-either-way viewpoint and my classical view that it is the Jury's decision not the Police's that I hold firm in my opinion that charging this chap was right. For the record I make charging decisions daily and am entirely objective when doing so, proper justice requires my peers and I to make decisions based on the information available at the time.

Everything hinges back to Sir Robert Peel's principle that the police should not usurp the role of the judiciary. We are fact finders; I NFA more jobs than charge only because most jobs are so hopeless it's a waste of public money to proceed.

The Doctor and Clara follow a signal to a mysterious place called Christmas Town.  It turns out that Christmas Town is Trenzalore. All of the Doctor's enemies have gathered there to kill him (like in the Pandorica Opens).  They want to prevent him from saying his name because that will somehow bring back the Time Lords.  For some reason that's not entirely clearly, the SIience actually teams up with the Doctor and are on his side. The enemies are afraid to attack because they think he will say his name, so it's a stalemate.  The Doctor realizes he may be stuck there for hundreds of years, so he sends Clara and the TARDIS back to earth. The Doctor ends up staying on Trenzalore for 900 years.  During that time a Weeping Angel grabs his leg and turns it to stone, so the Doctor amputates it and gets a wooden leg.  He also finds a Cyberman head that he carries around and calls Handles.  Plus there's a wooden Cyberman.  And all through out the episode the cracks from Amy's wall are present.  Finally, they use makeup to show the Doctor aging, so he looks really old. In the end, a mysterious woman (I forget her name) brings Clara back to see him.  The Doctor explains that he's in his 13th and last life.  It's explained very quickly and simply.  He reminds Clara that the Hurt Doctor means he (Matt) is really 12, and then says the 10th Doctor wasted a regeneration due to ""vanity"" issues.  He walks out into the field and expects to die for good. One of Amy's cracks opens in the sky and showers him with regeneration energy, so he's able to regenerate again.  It comes from Gallifrey ""with love"".  His regeneration is explosive, more so than Tennants.  Clara is far away and doesn't see the actual transformation.  Later she finds the TARDIS with the door open, walks inside, and sees Capaldi.  As for the Doctor choosing a face from the past, I'm not sure that it mentioned in this episode.  That may very well be the plan, but the reason may not be revealed until Series 8.  In fact, I don't think it's reveal in this episode where the regeneration energy from Amy's crack gives the Doctor one new life or a new cycle of 13."")

A note here: Mickey was never considered a companion.This is based on the opening credits where the companions have been listed as well as the Doctor (CE, DT and MS). Also on that basis the Master and Jackson Lake are companions as well as the fact that they were crucial in aiding the Doctor in defeating his enemies (Lord President Rassilon and the Cybermen, respectively). A case can also be made for Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart since he made appearances in the classic series well after the 'U. N. I. T. era' of Jon Pertwee.

Neither does thinking you are the best driver in the world ... so there you go.

My point is, it doesn't *matter* how good a driver you are, the skill is in anticipating what *other* road users will do. The faster you are travelling, the slower your reaction time to anything that might occur OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.

Bombing along a dual carriageway at 70 when the posted limit is 40 might be perfectly ""safe"" for you individually. But you can never guarantee what other road users will do. Hypothetically, let's say a driver on the sliproad is merging into the dual carriageway, and the posted speed limit (which he is observing), is 40. He maybe can't even SEE you yet (dual carriageways have a lot more curves than motorways, as they are basically upgraded versions of existing roads), and assumes it's safe to merge because any drivers will only be travelling at the same speed as him i.e. 40.

Then ""Mr Safe Driver"" arrives, bombing along at 70, and sideswipes the other driver, because his reaction time is just a fraction of a second and he's possibly got nowhere else to go.

All of the Doctor's enemies have gathered there to kill him (like in the Pandorica Opens).  They want to prevent him from saying his name because that will somehow bring back the Time Lords.  For some reason that's not entirely clearly, the SIience actually teams up with the Doctor and are on his side. The enemies are afraid to attack because they think he will say his name, so it's a stalemate.  The Doctor realizes he may be stuck there for hundreds of years, so he sends Clara and the TARDIS back to earth. The Doctor ends up staying on Trenzalore for 900 years.  During that time a Weeping Angel grabs his leg and turns it to stone, so the Doctor amputates it and gets a wooden leg.  He also finds a Cyberman head that he carries around and calls Handles.  Plus there's a wooden Cyberman.  And all through out the episode the cracks from Amy's wall are present.  Finally, they use makeup to show the Doctor aging, so he looks really old. In the end, a mysterious woman (I forget her name) brings Clara back to see him.  The Doctor explains that he's in his 13th and last life.  It's explained very quickly and simply.  He reminds Clara that the Hurt Doctor means he (Matt) is really 12, and then says the 10th Doctor wasted a regeneration due to ""vanity"" issues.  He walks out into the field and expects to die for good. One of Amy's cracks opens in the sky and showers him with regeneration energy, so he's able to regenerate again.  It comes from Gallifrey ""with love"".  His regeneration is explosive, more so than Tennants.  Clara is far away and doesn't see the actual transformation.

Nothing to do with political correctness, you're just pretty much saying ""immigrants/refugees bad"" and I disagree

How is the UK going to shit because of immigrants/refugees? 

Yep that's how accepting refugees works; everyone accepts droves of them into their homes. By the same type of reasoning, since you're so passionate about not letting refugees in, I wonder how many you have personally stopped. Are you patrolling the borders not letting anyone in? 

You're original comment was that more Jews weren't accepted because of how bad refugees are, when I'd already said anti-Semitism played a significant factor in this decision. 

Of course you can say whatever you like, I just wasn't really up for arguing with someone with an axe to grind about immigration in a thread about Jews in Britain.

How about the swear word 'bollocks'? I could imagine that it's use could be confusing to outsiders because it has different meanings:

Bollocks - nonsense/stupid/bullshit or a term of general disgust. ""What do you think of that?"" ""It's bollocks!""

The bollocks - It's good. ""How was the gig last night?"" ""It was The bollocks!""
