true,zalloy,null,null,"I don't mean that somebody could lose their house while away on holiday. That would be silly. What I actually mean is if someone's got a house, and they don't live in it at all (it isn't their regular home, or holiday home, they don't rent it, it isn't on the market for sale) for say,  3 years, then something needs to happen. 

They should be notified that the house has been vacant and unused for an extended period of time, and they should have to define to the town authorities what their plan is for the home.  Maybe they wish to renovate it, or hand it down to their children, or whatever. Maybe they still have a use for it. Some people don't. Some people will let a house sit idle for over 5 years, doing nothing with it other than paying taxes, and the place gets run down from years of disuse. Don't you think something constructive should be done with those properties?? I mean, even if the town gives the property owner a subsidy in exchange for use (not even ownership) of the property as a shelter for homeless, wouldn't that be better than just letting the place sit idle??


In some states, in the US, they have what's called ""adverse possession."" In states that have that law, if a person finds an abandoned house, moves in, keeps the place up, paying all taxes and so on, and they stay there for an extended period of time (usually 7-10 years), the house becomes legally theirs. 


Oh, BTW, to answer your question. I never go on holiday. Simply don't have the money for that. I live paycheck to paycheck. I rent an apartment, and I don't own a car.

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"So your logic is that if people need jobs they will appear?. Jobs are created when people have money to spend. People do not have money to spend at the moment and jobs are not being created. The fact that people are unemployed will not create jobs because those people are not able to put money into the economy. People who are unemployed already don't pay taxes. they can barely survive let along set up some business venture to 'create jobs'. 

Just saying 'they always have an opportunity to find ways to make money and thus create jobs' does not mean anything. Your saying that in the face of the facts. Unemployed people cannot just create jobs.

There is alot of money going around at the top, but the rich do not spend their money. lowering taxes wont make them suddenly employ lots of people when they already employ the minimum amount needed to run their business. regulation was cut before and we got a recession. Slashing taxes for the lower and middle classes is an idea, but the people at the top already have the money to spend and slashing their taxes wont make them spend anymore. 

Why would you slash people's welfare when they reduces the amount of money being put into the economy?. Poor people spend everything they have because they have to and thus it goes straight back into the economy.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; The single biggest misconception about the UKIP phenomenon is that it is all about policies: that potential UKIP voters are dissatisfied with another party’s policy in a particular area (usually Europe or immigration), prefer UKIP’s policy instead, and would return to their original party if only its original policy changed.

&gt; In fact, in the mix of things that attract voters to UKIP, policies are secondary. It is much more to do with outlook. Certainly, those who are attracted to UKIP are more preoccupied than most with immigration, and will occasionally complain about Britain’s contribution to the EU or the international aid budget. But these are often part of a greater dissatisfaction with the way they see things going in Britain: schools, they say, can’t hold nativity plays or harvest festivals any more; you can’t fly a flag of St George any more; you can’t call Christmas Christmas any more; you won’t be promoted in the police force unless you’re from a minority; you can’t wear an England shirt on the bus; you won’t get social housing unless you’re an immigrant; you can’t speak up about these things because you’ll be called a racist; you can’t even smack your children. All of these examples, real and imagined, were mentioned in focus groups by UKIP voters and considerers to make the point that the mainstream political parties are so in thrall to the prevailing culture of political correctness that they have ceased to represent the silent majority.

&gt; UKIP, for those who are attracted to it, may be the party that wants to leave the EU or toughen immigration policy but its primary attraction is that it will “say things that need to be said but others are scared to say”. Analysis of our poll found the biggest predictor of whether a voter will consider UKIP is that they agree the party is “on the side of people like me”. Agreement that UKIP shares their values and has its heart in the right place are also more important than policy issues in determining whether someone is drawn to the party. The idea that UKIP “seem to want to take Britain back to a time when things were done more sensibly”, and that “the bigger parties seem more interested in trendy nonsense than listening to ordinary people” both elicited stronger agreement among UKIP considerers than the party’s policy that Britain should leave the EU.",0,1362234218,null,0,false,0,c8oemg4,t3_19itj2,t1_c8oemg4,t3_19itj2,null,1431459199,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;So your logic is that if people need jobs they will appear?

No, they are created when there is need for the job. If people want something doing they'll pay someone to do it.

&gt;Jobs are created when people have money to spend. People do not have money to spend at the moment and jobs are not being created. 

People don't have money because the government taxes them too highly.

&gt;The fact that people are unemployed will not create jobs because those people are not able to put money into the economy.

That's true, but by claiming welfare they're draining the taxpayer. I recommend unemployed people try to earn money and the best way to incentive work is to cut welfare.

&gt;Just saying 'they always have an opportunity to find ways to make money and thus create jobs' does not mean anything. Your saying that in the face of the facts. Unemployed people cannot just create jobs.

Unemployed people don't create the jobs, they find the jobs. If you start a business you're finding a job. The customer is the one creating the job.

&gt;There is alot of money going around at the top, but the rich do not spend their money.

They do, even if they're just putting it in an investment it's still being spent.

&gt;lowering taxes wont make them suddenly employ lots of people when they already employ the minimum amount needed to run their business.

They invest where they think they'll make a good return, usually in other businesses. Banks aren't lending so investors are more important than ever. Your argument here is quite a typical one I hear from socialists, but it's completely flawed.

&gt;regulation was cut before and we got a recession

So I'm assuming you're blaming a lack of regulation on banks for the recession, that's fair enough, but what does that have to do with regulation in other areas?

Humans who lived under Islamic governments played a major part in our history many moons ago, and they were persecuted heavily for it. Everyone talks about the ""mathematical"" and ""scientific"" contributions that Islam made to the world, but those things weren't Islam, those things were contributed by people who happened to live under Islamic governments. And those Islamic governments damn will did all they could to block or stop those scientific developments, they certainly weren't helpers! It's a bit like saying that since Einstein is a Jew, the Theory of Relativity is a Jewish contribution to science. Infact a lot of the people living under Islam who came up with scientific developments were Christians and Jews anyway and were heavily persecuted.

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"&gt;People don't have money because the government taxes them too highly.

The rich have alot of money to spend, so reducing their taxes will not effect how much money they spend. Also by this logic it is then stupid to cut welfare since the poor have to spend all the money they get and this will mean they will have less to spend. 

&gt;That's true, but by claiming welfare they're draining the taxpayer. I recommend unemployed people try to earn money and the best way to incentive work is to cut welfare.

The facts show that these people are **already** looking for work but there are not enough jobs to go around. that is a fact. you cannot dispute it. all you would do by cutting welfare is decrease the amount of money being spent on the street (and thus keeping other people in jobs) whilst pushing people in starvation. why is helping the poor to survive a drain on the taxpayer whilst healthcare is not? or the army is not? 

&gt;Unemployed people don't create the jobs, they find the jobs. If you start a business you're finding a job. The customer is the one creating the job.

How do you propose that unemployed people 'find a job' by 'starting a business' if they have not got enough money to survive? how can you start a business if you do not have enough money to eat?

&gt;They do, even if they're just putting it in an investment it's still being spent.

I'm not saying they don't spend any money, i'm saying they spend alot less of it than people who are poor or middle class. People who are poor or middle class have no choice but to spend their money. If the rich are already not spending alot of their money then cutting their taxes won't make them spend more.

&gt;They invest where they think they'll make a good return, usually in other businesses. Banks aren't lending so investors are more important than ever

How groundbreaking; people invest where they think they'll make a good return. great. But why would they invest if people are not spending money? investors cannot create demand. A business exists to serve a need and if people are not spending then that need is not there. 

Why don't you try making an actual argument instead of just saying that investors invest. 

&gt;Areas like employment and planning are a massive pain for many business, while regulations on certain industries have made it completely unprofitable for small businesses.

That's just not true. like i said before the demand is not there. If business can make money then they will. if some business are put of by red-tape (that protects workers and the consumer) then there are plenty of others that will take their place and make money.

Completely agree, would have made my life at that job a hell of a lot easier, or redundant! 

&gt;Anyway, so the website says that they'll switch you to direct debit once they predict that you'll pay off the loan within 2 years. As the end of the financial year is approaching I guess that's when they'll find out. How smoothly and dependably does that work? Is it still worth giving them a call when the new financial year begins (or before)

As dependably as the tax system, so it works fine for most people, but there are always going to be unlucky people.

I will use the 12/13 tax year as an example to explain the process.

SLC will receive your details (your p14) from HMRC anywhere from early April 13 all the way through to December 13, even into 2014 in a minority of cases. (the delay could be down to HMRC or your employer)

If your loan outstanding is £3000, and you p14 says you repaid £2000 in 12/13, the system would send out a letter to your home address, (so make sure your details are updated) inviting you to start repaying by direct debit as you are now within 2 years of repaying your loan. You would then call SLC, with the payslips for the 13/14 tax year so that SLC can work out your loan outstanding. 

Your DD would be setup for the average of your payments from the previous year. The DD will be setup to start in 3 months from your call, in the meantime SLC will send notification to HMRC who will forward to your employer a request to stop taking SL deductions, this can take upto 28 days. 

The main hiccup which can happen here is that someone along the line fucks up and you end up having a SL deduction out your pay and by DD. SLC will send notice again if this happens and can refund you if you send your payslip to prove you had a deduction when you shouldn't have. Then it is smooth sailing.

If you don't move onto DD and you overpay, SLC will only be able to send the stop notice when they receive your tax file and so you can overpay by over a year. (e.g you fully repaid in april 2012, but deds were taken all the way through until your tax file was received in August 2014.)

Let me know if you need more details somewhere.

This isn't about downloading the latest spider-man - although, seeing as you're bringing it up, I object to the current model in hollywood whereby the poor bastard who *wrote* the amazing spider-man (or bastards, in this case, as three were on board to write the screenplay) probably saw a fraction of the earnings that the studio, the director or even the actors did. That film has made over $729 million to date...The way residuals work, is that the writers see roughly 8 cents *per DVD*, and nothing for digital downloads.

As it happens, in the case of The Amazing Spider-man, Vanderbilt, Kloves and Sargent are probably seeing slightly better residuals than most writers in hollywood, but when you apply those kind of earnings to a film like...I don't know, let's pick 50/50 out of the hat, the writers would see relatively little simply because the studio it's being released under is shafting the writers, and shafting them *hard.* - and it's no different for the music industry; Unless you're selling a shitload of music like...Jay-Z for example, you're seeing jack shit for your labours, simply because after the advance for your recording fees and living expenses, the label takes *those back* out of your paycheque, and more often than not, people who sign up to the sony/syco label (that's x-factor winners, by the way) you're seeing jack shit for your returns unless you're Leona Lewis or Kelly Clarkson. The problem with the entertainment industry as a whole, is that everyone...And I mean *everyone* except the actor, director and execs are getting royally shafted  on the principle of greed and taxes.

I flat out refuse to pay absurd amounts of money for my blu-ray; fuck that. I can and will often by the (much cheape, by the way) digital download from abroad, not pay the UK government tax, and will often download my TV shows and music if I can get away with it, largely because I've *bought the fucking things anyway!*.

Cae in point, my friend - I have pretty much every metallica album that's ever been released (even the shit ones). Now...Even under current law, because I've opted to download copies of my albums in FLAC from the internet, rather than rip and metatag them myself, I'm a pirate. Because I flat refuse to pay £145 a year, despite the fact that I *always* by the DVD collections of the documentaries and doctor who and instead opt to just download the TV shows after they come out, I'm branded a pirate.

And you know what? That's often the case with *many* (and by many, I mean a large majority of the people in the communities I frequent) of the people I know. I'm sick of people flat out labelling piracy as theft, especially when they're ignorant about the simple incompatibility between current Hollywood thinking and the digital age.

Install a telephone extension and move the router to somewhere more central

Assuming your router has Ethernet sockets buy a long Ethernet cable and run it round your walls to your computer.

Again assuming Ethernet sockets, buy an Ethernet-over-powerline kit and plug it into your mains.

Buy a wifi extender.

The cheapest and easiest is probably to buy a telephone extension kit, the most reliable is to run a length of Ethernet cable.

&gt;Am I wrong?

Yes. In the case of the song, if you really weren't going to buy it, then literally nothing is lost. Literally nothing. In the other, a tangible thing has been taken. So it's entirely different.

There was enough demand to want it, but not necessarily enough to pay for it. If I could easily duplicate my friend's Aston Martin for free I'd do it right now, but I wouldn't be willing to buy one even if I had the money to do so, as I don't think it's worth it. To some people this applies even to £0.99 (per individual song mind!)

Chelsea leading 1-0

The anti-Benitez cauldron predicted by the media didn't eventuate.
A world of difference from previous matches. Team working hard, crisper passes, multiple players running hard off the ball in attack. Fluid play like the start of the season.
 
Great work from Ba on numerous occasions, holding up the ball combined with good touches, some sorely-missed physicality up front. Shots from Oscar, Ba, nice free-kick attempt from Luiz. For once it seemed like we were dictating the pace of the game, the midfield in particular running the game nicely.
 
The goal came from a sublimely well-worked corner, great service from Oscar, with a nod-down to Ba who slotted easily.

Defence hasn't had much to do, but several short sharp passes working out quickly from defence, switching quickly to 
a running attack, not getting bogged down in midfield or uncertain in the last third like before. The Chelsea counterattack is back up and running. Our attacking moves are coming from multiple threats, not so Mata-reliant as in the past.

WBA not threatening for their part, longballs to an isolated frontman well handled by our defence.. 

A lot of touches here and there to remind us what talented and skillful footballers are on this Chelsea team. Enthusiastic effort from Luiz as usual.

Overall, a very positive half after a trying week, love it when Chelsea plays in this style. One nil up, could have been more.

&gt; The problem is the legal side of this is being decided by crumbly 90 year old men in hilarious wigs, who have no concept of what the internet, downloading, or in some cases, fire and the wheel actually are and what they do.

This is complete nonsense. It's not literally true, and neither is the underlying principle true;

* the judge in this case, Arnold J is 51 (average age for a UK MP in 2010 was 50);
* judges in English civil courts don't wear wigs;
* the specialist judges dealing with these issues very much understand what the Internet and downloading are about.

I know the press love to hate on them (for fairly obvious reasons; tending to stand up for people against newspapers, being an easy target, not being able to fight back) but the UK has a pretty awesome senior judiciary (although the magistrates are a bit dodgy).

There are two reasons why these blocks go in place;

* There is no one willing *and* able to challenge them - this is a problem with just how expensive the English legal system is, and, sadly, I have no idea (short of nationalising it) how to fix this;
* The law, written by pro-copyright lobbyists, embedded via international treaties, says this has to be done.

If you want to do something about this, complain to politicians; MPs, MEPs etc. - make them realise just how silly the laws they are passing are. If you can, join, support or donate to the various organisations opposing these laws [disclaimer, I 'work' for one of them], groups who are trying to build up the resources in terms of manpower, money and research to fight the pro-copyright lobbying.

&gt; All the time they want to keep on throwing money at placing blocks online, carry on, it's less money they have to spend on wrecking 12 year old's lives for downloading an album.

Sadly, this isn't the case.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;The rich have alot of money to spend, so reducing their taxes will not effect how much money they spend. 

They spend most of their money. Unless they keep it under their bed then it's being spent.

&gt;Also by this logic it is then stupid to cut welfare since the poor have to spend all the money they get and this will mean they will have less to spend. 

Welfare is money that has been stolen from someone else. It isn't money that they should have to begin with.

&gt;The facts show that these people are already looking for work but there are not enough jobs to go around. that is a fact. you cannot dispute it.

Because they're either not trying or they're living in an area with very low investment. Tax cuts would help.

&gt;all you would do by cutting welfare is decrease the amount of money being spent on the street (and thus keeping other people in jobs) whilst pushing people in starvation.

Coupled with tax cuts it would increase the amount in people's pockets.

&gt;why is helping the poor to survive a drain on the taxpayer whilst healthcare is not? or the army is not? 

For a start welfare recipients are not ""the poor"", the poor are the people that actually work but have very little to spend after tax.

Healthcare does have many problems, particularly the illiberal way it's funded. If we want to have a state funded system at least charge people for self-inflicted problems like obesity and smoking complications.

The Army provides a vital service to the Realm.

&gt;How do you propose that unemployed people 'find a job' by 'starting a business' if they have not got enough money to survive? how can you start a business if you do not have enough money to eat?

Initiative. It doesn't take much to get a small loan if needed. The government actually provides them now too, but they're unfortunately restricted to the young.

&gt;I'm not saying they don't spend any money, i'm saying they spend alot less of it than people who are poor or middle class.

I understand what you mean but that's just not how finance works. They spend all of it, even if they put it all in a hedge fund.

You seem to be really fixated on the rich, when I have only been advocating cutting taxes from the bottom up. I want taxes to be lower on the poorest people yet you seem to have changed the entire argument away from that to the hypothetical of tax cuts on the rich.

&gt;But why would they invest if people are not spending money? investors cannot create demand. A business exists to serve a need and if people are not spending then that need is not there. 

Tax cuts at the bottom would increase consumer confidence which would increase spending. But really that's not the point that I was making. There is money going around both the British and world economy that can be tapped into by good products and services.

There was a time before the Ipod existed, but then some intelligent blokes invented it with investment. By taking money away from investors we really minimise our growth which makes everyone poorer. Perhaps the Ipod could have been a British invention if there had been more investment in that technology.

There's demand for many products that don't yet exist, we need to be funding the development of these products.

&gt;Why don't you try making an actual argument instead of just saying that investors invest. 

Your argument seems to be that investors don't do anything, not even invest. If you had your way I'm sure they'd be taxed at 75%.

&gt;That's just not true. like i said before the demand is not there.

The demand is there, but the running costs and stupid regulation make the business less profitable and more bureaucratic.

&gt;If business can make money then they will.

So a company wants to build a factory to make a product but the regulation makes it far too expensive, the planning stage can take years, then what happens? It goes abroad. The demand is still there, it's just being supplied by foreign competition.

&gt;if some business are put of by red-tape (that protects workers and the consumer) then there are plenty of others that will take their place and make money. 

Most regulation doesn't do anything of value, employing someone is a massive pain in the arse for no good reason. Do something wrong and you'll get destroyed in an industrial tribunal.

Regulation forces you to ask permission before you save a cookie on a computer, there's some controlling the fuel efficiency of cars and one banning incandescent light bulbs.

If you find your connection has really slowed down again, then go into your router config page and disconnect from the internet from there. Don't make the mistake of repeatedly powering down your router from the mains as BT will think your line is unstable, and will reduce your ip profile which controls the max speed you can get. Basically just keep disconnecting from within your router till you find yourself on a better gateway. Normally only takes a few disconnects to get onto a decent one.

The last, large 'seize'ing of land in this country was by Oliver Cromwell - not the Royal Family. And was done with Parliamentary support. Even the Highland clearances were done with parliament support. The majority of the land the Royal Family owns today was taken from other landowners or 'aristocrats' (way to stay objective) who'd come into debt. 

This is all aside from the point that the Royal family haven't flexed their muscles in over a century, and they've atrophied. They're largely ceremonial, and do their job as figureheads really well. The Queen has incentive for long-term success if the country, whereas Parliament is all about the short-term, until the next party gets in and screws it all up.

It's far from a perfect system, but it's what we've got and it benefits the country to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds a year, which cannot be replaced in a republic.

Whilst the bit you're quoting might make you, as a UKIP supporter, feel like your intelligence is being insulted because of you don't hold that specific view on immigrants, it's obvious that it is an issue, however small, for most UKIP supporters and thus is worth mentioning. 

Additionally the quoted paragraph itself doesn't seem to be that inflammatory. It seems to just be painting a picture which displays that there is *serious* dissatisfaction with the way immigration has gone and is going. That it is not an insignificant issue. 

I don't see a way they could have put it across much nicer or with the same word count whilst explaining the peeves of a UKIP supporter on immigration so well. If you don't hold any of these sorts of views on immigration and such or you're worried about being perceived in an extremist manner I can sympathise, but this isn't painting UKIP as extremists on this.

There's is however big debate about how artists are going to get paid for what's out there on the internet already and these are the people IMO leading the way. 

As Billy Brag said recently: "" the record industry in Britain is still going down the road of criminalising our audience for downloading illegal MP3s. If we follow the music industry down that road, we will be doing nothing more than being part of a protectionist effort. It's like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube.""

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"1. They don't, your ignoring facts and logic. If somebody is earning £1,000,000 a month it is practically impossible (yes i know it is actually possible) to spend that every month. They save it, keep it to pass down to their children etc. I'm not saying they don't spend any money, they do. They spend alot of money. But if you are already earning say £1,000,000 a month and you spend £500,000 of that a month then having a tax cut that gives you an extra £200,000 will not make you spend anymore. Also, the way the rich do spend their money it tends not to go straight back into the economy in the way that the poor do; i.e by spending it instantly on things they need.

2. With regards to your point about welfare being money that is stolen. By that logic all tax is stealing money. People have no choice about being born into a society, people have no choice about part of that society they are born into and because we do not have enough jobs to go around people do not have a choice about being unemployed. Given that is the case and that these people are then expected to live by the rules that govern society, and to contribute to the rich's of those people who run big buisness when they do have money, why is it stealing if we redistribute people income so that the poorest can survive and then make are society a healthier society? If we did not do this then are state as we know it could simply not exist. Why should the masses in poverty accept a system in which they are forced to starve? You would have revolution on your hands. Society could not exist in this form for much longer. people would not accept that their fellow citizens were forced to starve because of an accident of birth.

3. With regards to you saying that people are not trying or they are living in an area of low investment. If i play along with your obsession with investment, then the whole country is a low area of investment because their are not enough jobs in every area of the country to go around. So then what is your suggestion? the the unemployed invest the money they do not have into business?

4. with regards to what when you say welfare recipeints are not the poor. So then your definition of 'the poor' is not how much money an individual has? People on welfare are almost always worse of than those who have a job unless they have children to support in some circumstances.  If you do not define poverty based on how much money you have then you are simply to illogical to argue with. 

5. Having an army protects the state, which ultimately means it protects citizens of the state from coming to harm. But cutting welfare puts those citizens back in harms way and what your suggesting would lead to their death. So why is it logical to pay tax for one thing that prevents death but not another thing that prevents death?

6. Initiative is not an answer. Initiative does not change turn crap into gold. Initiative is just a cop-out. Pretty much the only loans people on welfare can get are pay-day loans that put them into more debt. People on welfare can certainly not afford to get a loan big-enough to try and invest or start a new business. Even if they could, the majority of new business's fail (not because of red-tape, because of free-market principles) and so the majority of them would be put back into even further debt. 

7. because the rich already have enough money to invest in products and yet you seem to be suggesting that all they were waiting for to invest was just a little bit more money. That does not make any sense. That is my argument, i understand that investers invest but why give investers more money to invest (when they already have enough to invest) if the demand is not their they can build as big a business as they want, it won't have any customers. That's why you cut the tax's at the bottom and not the top. cutting tax's at the top is just a waste of money. The fact is that demand is not their at the moment because people are being squeezed and have less money to spend. This in turn is leading 'investers' to not want to invest. 

8. Regulation is not making it to expensive. If a company is big enough to supply a country whilst basing itself somewhere else then in that case it will always choose country's like China were it can basically treat the workers like slaves. In that case it will still sell its product in this country but build it in the other. If it isnt big enough to do that then it will base it in this country and we loose nothing. Country's always go abroad if they can afford it because we do not pay are workers £1 a day. It's not the regulation that push's them away. 

9. One thing that regulation does is protect the average worker from the exploitation of employers. We shouldn't say that companies need not be held accountable because it might discourage them from running their business. If they don't like it they can fuck off and other people will form a company to meet the demand. 

I'm sure their are unreasonable regulations, but that is not an argument against regulation.

Ba had a good goal today, but the setup by Luiz was even better IMO.

Foster was great for WBA today, basically single handedly kept them in the game by not allowing to many goals. Without him, we had three goals, easy

man of the match was hands down foster, runner up oscar. he was everywhere today. it looked like rafa had the 3 rotating more than usual to shuffle up their defense, which seemed to create more space with a lack of wingers, very good plan.

3/4s of a trillion sitting un-utilised in cash reserves is a bad sign. It shows a lack of direction and confidence of FTSE100 companies. As the article I linked to suggests, if those companies invested just £20bn of the £750bn in reserves, that would represent 1 per cent growth to the UK. 

We've been sat idling around 0 per cent, even negative, growth for several years now. Time for large companies to take the initiative.

EDIT: Also your point about what banks are doing with their money is also problematic, since the consequences of the banking crisis has been a generally elevated state of financial risk, particularly with SMEs.

The laws, policies and similar are being decided in the closed-door meetings between the lobbyists and the politicians/ministers/civil servants.

The attitudes of the big industry groups are similarly being formed at boardroom meetings in a handful of companies (maybe ... 6, globally?), on the basis of discussions with a handful of 'umbrella' lobbying groups (maybe 4, globally?) with a key dozen or so people setting the various agenda. While these groups see ""stopping the illegal pirates!!"" as their top priority, it is going to be very difficult to make any real progress in terms of opening up the heart of these industries (particularly TV and film) to artists/creators with new material (or wanting to make a bit more money), to tech companies with exciting new (or old, now) ideas for distribution systems, and to consumers, who want nice stuff to play with.",0,1362246061,null,0,false,0,c8oh59s,t3_19ife9,t1_c8oh59s,t1_c8ogdpj,null,1431460405,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

**If you're downloading music, films etc. without permission, you are probably breaking the law and can be sued.**

**If you're doing it a lot, and uploading, you may also be committing a crime and could end up in prison.**

**However, there have been very few cases on it, no full trials against individuals, so it is a bit unclear.**

And no, I'm not a lawyer (yet). Sorry.

When you download a file (even merely viewing it in your browser) you are creating a copy of that file on your computer.

UK Copyright law says that a copyright owner - someone who owns the copyright in a particular work - has the exclusive right to copy that work. This means that;

* if the file is protected by copyright, and
* you download/copy all or a substantial part of the file, and
* you do not have a licence (express or implied) to copy the file, and
* none of the specific ""permitted acts"" apply

you have infringed copyright in that work.

On the first point, things won't be covered by copyright if they're not ""original"" or if the copyright has expired (unlikely in most cases, but may apply to old (pre-60s) sound recordings of even older music, some books etc.). There's also some stuff about precisely what can be protected, but it is fairly broad.

On the second point, substantial is decided on a case-by-case basis, but looks at the quality, rather than quantity of what is being copied.

The third point; express licences are the easier to deal with (i.e. when you tick a box agreeing to conditions, or when a website has specific licence text) but it has been suggested in court that, when it comes to the Internet, if a copyright owner puts stuff onto the Internet themselves (without restrictions) she gives an implied licence to anyone to copy it for personal use. But that may be very fact-specific.

The fourth point; limitations on copyright in the UK are fairly narrow (but should be being expanded soon). There is no general ""fair use"" provision like the US, but there are exceptions for research and private study, criticism, news reporting and review, and educational use. But these are pretty narrow and unlikely to apply to unlicensed file sharing. 

So... **what happens if you infringe copyright?**

The default position is that the copyright owner (and any exclusive licensee) can sue you. They can recover damages (in theory, of an amount to compensate them for the loss they have suffered, in practice, no UK online file-sharing case has ever had damages assessed at trial), they can get an injunction (to stop you doing it again), they can seize ""infringing materials"" (such as CDs you might have burnt) and a few other things.

But that's just the civil liability. There are also **criminal offences**.

Under copyright law itself, there are a couple of criminal offences. Mostly they related to infringing copyright ""in the course of business"", but there is one for communicating works to the public (another kind of infringement), not for profit, but to an extent which prejudicially affects the copyright owner. This offence (or rather, a slightly different one - see a bit later) has been used to prosecute and convict people for file-sharing. However, those cases all involved guilty pleas (so no trials) and in most of the ones I'm aware of, the prosecutors relied on the wrong offence (one for dealing in physical objects).

Given this, we don't really have a definition of what amounts to ""prejudicially affect"" so it isn't clear whether every-day unlicensed file-sharing falls within this offence.

There is also a non-copyright offence called ""conspiracy to defraud."" This is a really nasty law (and there have been calls to repeal it for years), which is incredibly broad. Some have argued that unlicensed file-sharing goes against this law (and one person has been convicted of it for running a linking site - but that case is pending appeal), but there haven't been any definitive cases on it.

Bale in the free floating role. Livermore over Parker. Jake is more controlled in his movement, whereas Parker runs himself all around the park leaving Dembele to fend for himself. Arsenal's strongest point right now is the center of their midfield, so I think having a more controlled central midfield would be better against Arteta, Wilshere, and Cazorla. Also, Dawson over Caulker as he is better experienced in dealing with the high emotions in derbies.

How much of the budget would you like to be spent on welfare? Would you rather we made more people unemployed to protect the already generous Welfare programme for the unemployed?

It would be more fair on our citizens lives if we spent more of the budget on creating useful tax recipients such as solders and creating real wealth and an opportunity to export for our manufactures, builders and their suppliers.

I think it's crazy that we spend this kind of money a year on Welfare yet we're groaning at the cost of the Aircraft Carriers and Trident II, when their **total combined** construction cost will be barely twenty percent of our **annual** Welfare spending. Let alone all the money it takes away from housing, infrastructure, power stations, railways and airports.

If we really cared about our Citizens lives and their future, we should be investing more in the economy and it's competitiveness, creating jobs/opportunity, more housing as well as reducing the cost of living such as energy prices (more cheap domestic power) and reducing tax/VAT (especially on oil) that helps fund our bloated welfare programme.

I'm not completely against Welfare, but if we didn't have it and someone suddenly suggested we spend £170 billion a year on it, I would think they were mad.

&gt; **Andrew Marr**: And you said, “Will you as Prime Minister undertake to implement whatever Leveson
asks?”

&gt; **Hugh Grant**: That's correct

&gt; **Andrew Marr**: And what did he say?

&gt; **Hugh Grant**: He said, “If it’s not bonkers, I’ll do it.”

and in the Andrew Marr/David Cameron interview on the same show:

&gt;**Andrew Marr**: Since we've just had Hugh Grant, I should probably start by asking you about that. You told him that if what Leveson suggested was ""not bonkers"", you would implement it. Is that still the case?

- Find out quickly what experience the Uni will arrange for you in your first year, if it isn't a lot, continue to volunteer at the school. It's all about experience in teaching, so the more you can get, the better. The more varied the experience the better too, so if your current school has got you in say, Year 5, make sure you ask them to do a KS1 placement as well. As well as this, try to do a range of tasks, from sitting in on lessons to taking small groups. Also, if you're in a position to do so, volunteer for field trips/residentials; they're excellent opportunities.

- Other than that, make sure you add as many strings as possible to your bow. What I mean is, additional qualifications or things for uni might offer to get. In particular, anything in ICT or P.E. Primary schools are crying out for ICT and PE specialists or anyone who can offer anything in those areas.

- Guzan runs out and starts to swing his leg, looking like he's about to punt the ball and/or Bale 80 yards

- Bale sees his career flash before his eyes, makes a split second (read: millisecond) decision to shield his leg

- Because of the sheer speed at which everything is happening, Bale is unable to get his legs back underneath him and goes sliding across the ground.

- Bale doesn't call for a foul, complain, or feign injury...instead, he simply looks disappointed in himself for missing such a great opportunity and gets up

A loss in this game for us I fear will make top 4 quite a long shot unless we really get our shit together and beat some of the top clubs.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"How did you draw that conclusion from that passage? If anything it just demonstrates that Nazism was a jumbled and bastardised chimera of other systems and ideologies. He clearly hated communists, and internationalists in particular, thereby apparently rejecting the lateral conception of society, of class being the fundamental divider, and instead obviously choosing a vertical divider in nationalism, where borders and race are the dividers. 

However we know that socialism does not have to be internationalist, look at Bukharin and Stalin's 'socialism in one country' and 'revolutionary patriotism' . Look at Ba'athist socialism too, which sought a pan-Arab state largely defined by perceived ethnic unity, and Tito in Yugoslavia. Hitler's bizarre definition here draws both a lateral and vertical divide, where he sees the state, race and class as inseperable, not in opposition. Don't forget that part of the way he excited popular opinion against Jewish people was to highlight the class divide between the 'productive' working Germans and 'stateless' Jews. Also don't forget that whilst the Nazis allowed private ownership of the means of production in a nominal sense, it was controlled and appropriated by the state in the real, substantive sense, and that all people and belongings served 'social' and state ends rather than individualist ends.

So all that quote shows is that Nazism was a weird hodgepodge, or rather appropriation, of both left and right, and intellectually has no indisputable, emphatic location anywhere.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Paypal is a great way of getting your money frozen then losing it, they're a bunch of crooks. 

Long story short; 5 years ago, small underground niche dance record label setup to promote DJ's and their gigs so minimal sales, lots of DJ artists in different countries to pay differing small amounts to ( max was £600 for a remix if I remember correctly  ) you're talking; Germany, Canada, Italy, Hungary, Switzerland, France etc. etc. 

Paypal seemed like a much better way of doing this without using cheques or transferring using pain in the arse IBAN numbers. So I transfer about £8000 into a newly created Paypal business account where you can send each artist an email with a private link and they can get the money themselves with their own Paypal accounts.

The emails all go out from the Paypal site and ( get this ) they send an email accusing us of money laundering and freeze the account. We obviously complain, but they want all of our accounts, sales figures etc. to prove we weren't. Of course some of these being remixes, small digital distribution agreements and - oh it's a long story I don't have all night, let's say a ton of small transactions to sift through to even begin presenting a case; they just made it an impossible task. 

Then in a barrage of increasingly heated emails with Paypal our login stopped working and our emails went unanswered. Silence. 

To add insult to injury you do some digging to see what action you *can* take against them, and you find out that there are literally thousands of others in the [same boat.](http://www.paypalsucks.com/) 

As I said, bunch of crooks. Some cashless society that will be.

Considering the counter advert was done by an institution that holds the bible as its central doctrine, and said bible contains a quite final solution to the gay problem, I think it is safe to say there was spiteful intent.

true,PTRJK,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; In Britain today, most people aren't on welfare. Therefore, the government can say 'It is the welfare system that is the biggest strain on the economy', and people buy into it because it is an easy answer.

But it is the biggest strain because [it dominates the UK's budget](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/dec/04/public-spending-uk-2011-12-interactive) each year with a cost of around £170 billion... and it's obviously not the easy answer. The Government will be demonized if they touch it, which is why they barely have compared to a department like defence which is being cut by around a half since 2008 (£67 billion to £37 Billion).

People aren't doing anything wrong by claiming Welfare but it is far to generous, unreasonably expensive (poorly allocated however) and should be cut. Would you rather we made more people unemployed to protect the already generous Welfare programme for the unemployed?

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; As for the anti-gay community it's a dubious community at best usually backed by some quite extreme ideologues.

I said the ex-gay community.

&gt; Human sexuality is nothing close to being hard programmed and changes over time. None standard sexual experimentation is nothing to be ashamed of. It certainly isn't a disease that has to be ""gotten over"".

The prevailing consensus in the psychological community is that homosexuality is hard wired and cannot be changed. But I agree it is not a disease. 

&gt; Considering the counter advert was done by an institution that holds the bible as its central doctrine, and said bible contains a quite final solution to the gay problem, I think it is safe to say there was spiteful intent.

It's safe to say that the advert was aimed to challenge the consensus that one should accept one's homosexuality. This is hardly spiteful, even if it is misguided. The advert certainly doesn't constitute a threat, which is the cogent point. 

&gt;  Stonewall was challenging people to ""get over"" a prejudice, the Christian group was encouraging people to ""get over"" a sexual preference. I'll grant you that it is an attack on homophobia and this is quite a difficult edge case, but it isn't an attack on ""ex-gays"". 

I don't think Stonewall did mean to attack ""ex-gays"", my contention is that both sides have the right to express their argument so long as they are not being threatening towards one another.

Once the dust settles we will have a little more inflation as they talk down GBP but not much. What we will be left with is a low wage economy where most people can't afford a home. After all, most people can't afford a home now. Interest rates will return to ""normal"" 4%+ and the UK will be a shitty, fairly poor country.

I think the inflation already occurred, people mistook this for wealth, and now we are simply one rung down the ladder, the top rung being the first world and the bottom rung being the third world. The UK is afterall in a multi-decade managed decline.

ps this excludes all the problems we will have with demographics and energy, which will make 2008 look like a tea party

Biology and sociologists would disagree. I'm pretty sure anyone can be conditioned to get a sexual response from [almost anything](/r/confusedboners). Children with no concept of gender have much room for exploration.

I did not draw my conclusion from that passage, but from reading history books. I merely used that passage to show that the term 'Socialist' in the Nazi's name is clearly a misnomer. From Hitler's own words it is patently obvious that *he* didn't want it to mean anything that we would even remotely recognise as socialism now.  

I reject these revisionist versions of the Nazi's position on the political spectrum. Yes, they co-opted *some* popular ideas and terms from the period – as you point out yourself, it is in the nature of despots to bolster their positions by whatever means they have at their disposal – but the overwhelming majority of Nazi policies were extremely Right wing. From their belief in being a superior race, having the right to subjugate their perceived inferiors, to their unbridled nationalism, and almost everything else in between. There is consensus amongst the majority of serious historians that they *were* from the far Right.

My point is that pushing an ex-gay agenda is immoral because arguably ex-gay isn't really possible.

I'd like to distinguish between not-gay and ex-gay. If you're not gay, that's fine, but if you're ex-gay then you're pushing the idea of 'curing' therapy rather than just the idea of straightness in itself.

It's hard to condemn being ex-gay and proud in and of itself, but if you start to take ads out etc then you're pushing an agenda that makes other people miserable.

The article is about ex-gay, so I assumed you meant ex-gay. If you just mean straight people, that's fine (though I hardly think we're so downtrodden as to need an ad campaign).

Because it's true. The biggest fascist political party in this country by a country mile is the BNP and they are based on white nationalism. They got half a million votes last time around which was a small percentage of the total but still represents the biggest fascist threat to this country. If you look at other countries in Europe they have similar figures, although Britain is lucky not to be in as bad a situation as Greece at the moment with Golden Dawn who came out of nowhere to become a significant political force in Greece.

Communicating to the public (i.e. uploading) to an extent which prejudicially affects the copyright owner is a crime. While so far no prison sentences have been given for this (a suspended one in Scotland, fines and community service in England), it carries a maximum of 2 years in prison. As no cases have been argued (all guilty pleas) we don't have a definition of ""prejudicially affect"" but it would probably involve quite a bit of downloading.

Alternatively there's the offence of ""conspiracy to defraud"" which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. This has been used against people running sites, but never against anyone for just sharing (uploading or downloading). SOCA thinks it can be, as do some of the private enforcement groups.

&gt; substantial is decided on a case-by-case basis, but looks at the quality, rather than quantity of what is being copied.

Copying from a work - say a book - is only infringement (ignoring other factors) if a ""substantial amount"" is copied. Collecting societies used to say n-hundred works was too little, but then the CJEU ruled that a few words (5, out of a newspaper article) could amount to a substantial amount if they were a key part.

So what matters is not how much of the thing (quantity) you copy, but whether you copy an important bit - the bit which has the ""value"" or something (quality). It's a bit wishy-washy for now, until courts flesh it out.

You'll notice you don't generally get the charge when shopping with a big chain but you will if you're shopping with a smaller retailer. This is only because the Banks charge the smaller companies more.

The more card transactions you have as a retailer, the lower the cost per transaction. Some companies have no transaction fee at all, as they have such a high number of customers it's more important to the bank to make their card useable in any instance.

American Express, for example, is notoriously hard to use in shops due to its higher than average transaction fees.

With all banks, not only do you pay a fee for the actual transactions, but also for the card machines. Once you have a certain number of customers the bank will make the card reader available for free.

There is also the matter of Islamist terrorism, which [is a threat in this country right now](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-21545773).

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"Fair enough, but even then, as a supporting statement the passage you cited certainly doesn't support your conclusion that they were 'indisputably' right wing. You're definitely right in rejecting the dense assertion that because they were the 'National *Socialist* German Workers Party' that hurr durr they're anything like a modern socialist party. ""Look! Look! They both say socialist!""

However you can't call people trying to look beyond a frankly inadequate binary system to describe Nazism 'revisionist'. A great many Nazi policies were right wing. Some of them are indeed absolutely indisputably so. However many Nazi policies were from the other end of this binary political spectrum- they were highly anti-capitalist, against the free market, with a stated aim to 'destroy' the capitalist system, and allowed private enterprise as long as it supported the aims of the state and could be subject to state direction.

The real crux of debates like this is whether concepts such as nationalism and racism are fundamentally right wing. People over the last 60 years have claimed so, as you do yourself above, and perhaps this is where there can be said to be 'revisionism' in terms of how people define the terms of debate. However there have been racist left-wingers (probably on the balance of history less of them), and of course left-nationalism is, although again rarer, an existent phenomenon- so the Nazis cannot be declared right wing by definition of being nationalists and racists. And subjugating other peoples is definitely not a purely right wing phenomena, just a glance at the USSR  demonstrates that.

What it serves to show is that the terms of debate are inadequate and have been appropriated for lazy political ends. If people can, through labelling, show that that the Nazis, or the BNP, are politically a long way away from themselves then they must be doing something right, and the further away you are from them the better you must be.

In trying to label an organisation that indeed carried out some privatisation of state services 'socialist' purely because of their name is stupid and the result of significant spin. However to label them entirely right wing is also the result of mental gymnastics, as you have to ignore the fact that the means of production were, although not directly nationalised, suzerain to the state and 'the volk', and also the directly anti-capitalist objectives of the party (many of which continued even after Rohm was removed from the situation). It does nobody any good because it allows odious figures like Nick Griffin wriggle room in distancing himself from his spiritual kin.

On the subject of the Left at Sussex, it's interesting you say that the teaching is genuinely impartial. Obviously I never experienced political teaching there, but was reasonably connected to the students union via friends and so on. I'm extremely fond of Sussex, and very proud of the strong leftist tradition amongst the student body but I often found/find the culture exasperating at the same time. [This](http://www.danielsinger.org/swift.html) article sums up the biggest problem with the left as I see it - that is that it is so currently so riven. That is most visible in those factions which you mention - the sort that will call you a conservative for reading Tim Bale, etc. I see it now with some of the communications that are being put out abut the current occupation. It's clearly (in my opinion) a really valid cause and I back their motives 100% but I find it really frustrating to read *some* of the material that the students put out on the subject because it frequently smacks of self-conscious ""revolutionary"" rhetoric which I feel weakens the message because it makes it easier to dismiss as students 'playing' at being activists. Not to do down what the occupiers are doing generally, of course, and this is far from being a problem local to Sussex. I feel that even fairly media aware commentators like Owen Jones are susceptible to it when they use classic Marxist terminology like ""the workers"". The difficulty is that the majority of people who this refers too don't self identify with that label and so the Left is crippled by a lack of ability to galvanise a lot of the less highly politicised middle classes (and indeed working classes) around a shared identity.

true,Duc_de_Nevers,cnty-ni,Norn Iron,"&gt;I'm ex-forces, you're ex-shooting for sport. Would you agree there is a massive chasm between using a weapon for target shooting and using it against another human being knowing that it could end their life?

Yes, certainly with the type of shooting I did, which was very slow paced.  The focus was on control of your body and your breathing to try and ensure precise placement of your shots, a far cry from a self-defence situation in which you have a very short window in which to think and act.  There are faster-paced disciplines, such as Bianchi, which require rapid target acquisition and firing, but I never took part in these.  Even if I had, though, I suspect that I would struggle to use a firearm in self defence.  I was drilled in range discipline to a point where it became instinctive, so actually pointing a firearm at a human being would be hard for me.

Then, of course, you have the massive psychological difference between a controlled range and a life threatening situation.  I remember seeing a picture of Aldo Nadi (probably the greatest fencer of the early 20th Century) taking part in a duel with sharp swords.  His form, normally perfect, had completely gone to hell, simply due to the stress of being in a life-threatening situation.

&gt;And if you do, would you agree that unless you're prepared to do that it makes the whole point of carrying one ""for self defence"" utterly futile?

Yes, and if you aren't prepared to do so carrying a firearm may well make such a situation worse if your assailant manages to disarm you.  I remember reading about the 21 foot rule some time ago, which is based on some research in the US that found that in the time it took for the ""average"" police officer to draw and fire their weapon, an assailant could cover a distance of 21 feet.  These are people who have received at least a modicum of training in how to respond to an attack; how much greater is this distance going to be with a panicked, untrained individual?  You would need to be drawing your weapon on everyone crossing over to your side of the road on the off-chance they were attacking you  to be sure of defending yourself.

Aside from the economy, imigration is the single biggest issue concerning likely UKIP voters. Imigration into the UK is almost solely down to EU migration. Without reconsidering Britain's position in government, no government can really affect the migration rate from Europe. 

Separating these issues and getting wound up about the illegal immigration is really stupid. Illegal immigration is a nice political tool, but it's just not relevant to the figures - it's a tiny percentage.  Yes border control is often inept, under funded and crap, but even a highly funded system would never be perfect.

The heart of the matter is: Is easy migration for UK citizens (for retirement, travel, business etc.) worth tolerating migration from less developed countries?

Everyone would suddenly start buying guns if they were legalised for one reason or another. Some would buy because guns are cool, some would buy to exercise this new liberty, and many would buy because they would anticipate that everyone else would own a gun.

I'd fall in to that last camp: I would trust myself with a gun, but I'd not stretch to trusting anyone else with theirs. I'd probably never take it out of the strong-box, but I'd want the comfort of knowing that I'd be on an equal footing with every one else. The legalisation of guns would be on every newspaper, all over social media, it'd not be something that'd slip under the radar;  if guns were legalised in the UK I'd expect in the early years following legalisation that ownership, particularly among males, would be higher than in the US. 

As much as I don't like the pro-gun American lobby, they're right in as much as having a gun *is* an equaliser, they're just wrong about guns creating a safer society.

EDIT] All that said, I'm struggling to imagine a scenario where I'd use my hypothetical gun a in real life scenario. I mean, no-one would really want to murder me, and if I were to be robbed I'd not want to be carrying a gun.

This just isn't true. The UAF aren't golden themselves, but to make out that the 'EDF'(lol?) are 'mostly behaving themselves' is just a lie. If you have ever been to one of their protests or even watch some youtube videos you will see that they are not 'well behaved' and most of them are just drunk hooligans who use the protest as a cover to cause trouble and get into fights. 

Normally if they cant get into fights with the UAF they just end up getting into fights with themselves.

Again claiming that the EDL do not hurl vile abuse but just 'behave themselves' is just a gross fabrication of what actually happens. You dont even have to research hard to see how untrue this is.

&gt; Another irony is that it is this politically correct outlook of speech codes and offence-taking that is the midwife of Clarkson’s stellar success in recent years. How else to explain how a mildly amusing TV car-show presenter with bad hair became a television and publishing superstar? All he has to do is act as a spokesman for everyone annoyed by the real and perceived petty restrictions on our freedom driven by the new illiberal liberalism and he has a guaranteed audience. Really, organisations like Unison shouldn’t demand his head, they should demand a cut of his earnings. (A variety of trade unions, quangos and campaigning groups might also consider sticking an invoice in the post to Larry David and Ricky Gervais, too.)
&gt;
&gt; Whether you like Jeremy Clarkson and Stewart Lee is a matter of taste. (I like them both, but rather less than I used to.) The real difference, the real cause of the outrage about Clarkson, is that it is assumed that his audience is too thick, too Neanderthal to get that he doesn’t really mean it. So stupid are his fans deemed, in fact, that some commentators must have expected bands of Clarksonists to go out marauding the next day and, deprived of guns and ammunition, start spitting on strikers in contempt. Clarkson’s followers are believed to be as devoted and literal as some of the more fervent disciples of an earlier JC.
&gt;
&gt; Stewart Lee’s liberal audience, on the other hand, is assumed to be educated and cultured; they ‘get’ irony. Where Clarkson is a thug and a bully, Lee - and other liberal comedians like him who indulge in ‘black’ humour - are deemed to be edgy. That’s no reflection of reality, however; that’s just liberal self-congratulation, a censorious version of masturbation.

As for his management at Tottenham, I think he did a great job. He's a very particular type of manager, hailed for his 'man management', but silently rebuked for his poor tactical awareness makes him somewhat unique. Also the fact that he's illiterate only exacerbates his reputation for poor tactics. For example when losing to Villa 1-0 at the end of last season, despite completely dominating the game, and being a man down, he decided to sub on another defender to bring us back to a 4-at-the-back system! 

He was brilliant for players like Modric, proven ability, mature enough to have established their own system and style of play, and he simply made Luka, Rafa, all the Spurs players happy, motivated them excellently, while nurturing them individually too. The differences, however, between him and AVB, are becoming more and more clear. Partly due to the success of Bale. Gazza explained in a recent interview that AVB has been amazing in sitting him down, and really going through how Gaz can fit AVB's style, what he can do best for the team, how he can deal with 2 defenders, or even 3, and also be able to draw players away from his teammates. I attribute, and in fact, so does Gareth, his inspired form to AVB. G-Baz even compared AVB to 'arry, saying that Redknapp simply told him to play how he wants, to have free reign over his play, and go out and ""express himself"". For these reasons, as time goes on, I have become less fond of Harry as a manager.

In the end, it came down to Levy wanting a younger manager, who is more tactically aware, who will bring in youthful talent, as opposed to buy big. There's a funny Redknapp press conference where he explained that he asked our highness, Daniel, for Tevez and Cahill, but he got Louis Saha and Ryan Nelson. Classic. Whilst this season, we seemed to have brought in youth, potential, and bargains in the form of Gylfi, Moussa, SuperJan, Clint, Hugo and, of course, Lewis. All absolute bargains. And despite this, we still only spent about 10 million, deducting transfers out. If we had Champions League football, we'd be 30 million up in the form of TV money! Imagine! 

I think at the end of the day, I still love the melty-faced, lovable gent, 'arry. He did us well. But with AVB in, I believe that Danny made the right decision. He can take us to the next level. He's the long term solution to a problem I didn't know was there. With the new training ground, new stadium on the way, a new manager, with his own system, and bringing in his staff and some great new players, we look a different team to the one that laboured onto the field in the 2nd half of last season.",0,1362275011,null,0,false,0,c8oospn,t3_19juzt,t1_c8oospn,t3_19juzt,null,1431464126,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

This coupled with companies wanting to make money meant that they were able to sell drinks and low prices, thus spreading the holiday cheer more. But now it's not even about celebrating the patron saint it's about drinking.

You could conceal a knife and walk into a room and kill someone, however we see almost every week (in the US) how a gunman can conceal multiple guns and kill multiple people before being stopped.

All four are now mounted professionally and hanging on my wall. My second time in New York City, when I got to go back and look at them in person again, I bought a book full of letters from Vincent to his brother, Wil, and read it a few times. I loved Vincent, and the song Starry, Starry Night has given me rich feelings. And DESPITE already knowing him and loving him and loving his work, I still cried when I watched this episode. To see him personified, and to see someone portraying his emotions. And the song and the curator's description... All just amazing. One of my favourite episodes by far.

Americans have enjoyed this liberty for a long time, and that's fine. That's their thing, but it's not **our** thing. We aren't no dumbski's, donny (not that American's are ""Dumbski's"", it' a reference towards one of the best mafia films to ever exist; made and starring Americans).

I don't know the date that they first enjoyed this ""liberty"", but it's not the same epoch that we live in now.

So, by hypothethizing that we were able to ""bear arms"" in this society, it would probably be a bad idea.

Yanks (If I can call you that, sans disrespect. It's shorter; call me a leprechaun if you like, or a ""Leper"", I don't care), haven't abused this system to no end, but it seems to be a right thatcan be respected (judge each case on its' merit) but there has been no rampage.

In the United Kingdom, when someone ""home invades"", we get pissed and call the police. Regardless of if that works, we do it anyway.

If we start letting arms (just talking about ""intruder"" - ""proctector"" circumstances), I think this new liberty of force will mostly end in lawsuits and ""claims"" (God damn, if we don't like a good claim [Note to Americans: Most of our adds are about trying to profit against someone!  We even don't have erectile dysfunction ads to clear the tension; we have graphic car-crash ads, even during tea-time. Yeah, shit be real here.)

For me, my worry, is that we would be authorizing the wrong people to caarry a piece, for reasons that they have interpreted incorrectly (Sorry; the rest of the world; We have extreme WANKERS all over), and after that, fuck knos qill happen.

**UPDATE ON OPENING TIME. GET THERE EARLY!**

Hello all!

Well it's been quite a few weeks!  Two stunning last minute goals from Dembele and Bale gave us two superb away results at Lyon and West Ham. Both will live long in the memory, especially Gareth's at the Spammers, absolutely stunning stuff and 3 points we well deserved. Here it is from a Spurs fans perspective behind the goal!:-

Onto this weekend and the visit of that lot from Woolwich. Lets hope we can keep 11 men on the pitch this time, we are in great form and owe them for that result earlier this season....

Come along to watch us send them back down the Sevens Sisters Road with a nice 7 point cushion between us!!!

Ian at the Kings Head is once again kindly opening for us!:-

The London Parliament is a mess that is not fit for purpose in the modern world. Scottish Independence is the only viable route to reform for us. We'll have a PR-based government in contrast to a Westminster that isn't even willing to try the AV baby step.

The main difference that I can see is that beams do not have a ballistic trajectory, which you have to compensate for when moving between different ranges.  Pistol bullets travel more slowly that those from rifles, due to the shorter barrel, so the trajectory is a bit more pronounced.

Also, with a firearm, there is the tiniest fraction of a second after you pull the trigger when the bullet is in transit in the barrel, during which movement by the shooter can affect where the projectile ends up.  A lot of practice and training goes into controlling your movement before and immediately after the trigger is pulled, so I would be disappointed if they didn't include a very small delay in between activating the beam and registering the hit location.

So that leaves handguns and fully automatic 'assault' rifles as being illegal.   If someone in the UK wanted a firearm there are sufficient options available for them to scratch that itch already. 

And when handguns were legal in the UK it's not like everyone had one and the ebil socialists took away our guns... the vast majority of the population of the UK remained unaffected by that legislation.   If they didn't want one then why would they want one now when their are still a plethora of options (that the majority don't make use of) available?

But ""criminal"" is not a category of person. They don't self-identify as criminals. They're not in a club. It's just a descriptor we give to ""people who commit crime"". For a start, we are all criminals e.g. we all sometimes drive a little bit too fast, or rip CDs for our friends, or download stuff we shouldn't, and other crimes that you personally don't think should really count. For another thing ""non criminal"" is not a category either, if you mean by that ""people who never have and never will commit a crime"". So if you run background checks and determine that my cousin Bob is not a criminal, therefore it's safe for him to own a gun, that doesn't mean he never ever will commit a crime with it. He might get into financial trouble, borrow from some nasty people, and one day decide that robbing the post office is the only logical solution to his problems. Or he may come home and find his girlfriend in bed with the milkman and shoot them both in his rage and fury. That's not because he was secretly a criminal after all and he never should have been allowed to have a gun in the first place. It's because it's a mistake to think of ""criminals"" and ""non criminals"" as populations of people. 
So it's a mistake to imagine that criminals and non-criminals are discrete populations of people, or that it's possible or desirable to sort people that way. ",0,1362302469,null,0,false,0,c8ouvox,t3_19jog1,t1_c8ouvox,t1_c8opf6y,null,1431467101,49,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,49

This gives the following:

* On the Ethnicity tab: total white: 4887435 (out of 8173941 = 59.8% of Londoners are White)
* On the Country of Birth tab: total UK-born: 5173201 (out of 8171465 = 63.3% of Londoners are British).

No surprises in my team.  The biggest decision is at centre-back.  IMO, Caulker is a no-go as he's positionally probably the weakest of the centre-backs at the moment (understandably, given his age) and our line needs to work the offside trap perfectly with the pace of Walcott against us.  Gallas might even start ahead of Dawson, to give us more pace.

Lennon's form has dropped recently and I've considered bringing Siggy in, which would also narrow the pitch and help us with numbers in the middle.  However, Lennon's defensive work is as good as any winger in the world, IMO, and he will be important today in keeping Monreal honest.

Farmers in my experience, over here have guns for the sole purposes of sport shooting and vermin control (though I would say most have them for the former reason and some can be a little too obsessed with it). Also in the UK all gun owners must have licenses for each gun that they own and are checked on regularly for any mental health issues and violent conduct. This does not happen to the same extent in the US. The licensing process also requires an individual to provide references for the them-self and often this is done by someone they know that already owns a gun.


Any shoot that I've been at, all participants make sure that no one has drank beforehand and would not hand a gun to someone they didn't trust. If anyone was noticed to have any suicidal feelings or that they have any notion that they need a gun for self-defence they would probably be reported by their friends to the licensing authority (and I do know of case where the latter situation has occurred).

true,YankshireRose,eng-durham,Durham,"What a load of nonsense this article is.  There are 6 million non-military American expats.  1,700 of them have renounced their citizenship.  Wake me up when this is an actual news story and not some puff piece designed to freak out expats about filing taxes before the 15 April deadline.

You only owe tax on your income if you earn more than $72,000 a year.  You file a form 1040.  It's completed in much the same way the same form would be completed if you were stateside.  Does it suck that you have to complete a return, even if you don't actually owe any tax and don't have a penny of income you've earned stateside?  Yes.  

On the other hand, the expats I know fall largely into two categories: people who moved here to be with their spouse (vast majority) or people who came here for work.  The first category seem to be stay-at-home moms, students, or people with normal (read: not high-earning) jobs.

Of the second, much smaller category, most of those people are here on transfers.  Because they aren't permanently settled here, are based back in the US, are paid in dollars in accounts back home, and may not even spend most of the year here, they pay US taxes anyway.  Usually the company they work for takes care of their tax arrangements for them.  There are people who move here for love and have higher-paying jobs, but they are very much in the minority.  In other words, this tax issue isn't fair, sure, but it only really impacts a very small minority of expats.

If I gave up my American citizenship, I couldn't vote in US elections.  It would make things more complicated for me on a personal level.  Inheritance can be more complex for non-resident non-citizens, for example.  If I ever wanted to go back, for whatever reason, I could.  British citizenship means the same sorts of things for me as well. It makes life a lot easier for me, and it's a reflection on where I am settled.

""Hard"" information in background checks would be the sort of information on a PNC, which shows convictions and cautions.  However, each police force maintains ""soft"" information databases of differing levels of depth.  If you are drunk and threateningly shouty on the street in front of your ex's house and the police are called, there's a record of that information.  Who came, what they did, what you said, how often this has happened, etc.  It's part of how different agencies can track things like domestic violence allegations between partners in divorce or custody proceedings.  People can make all sorts of allegations, especially when children are involved, and it's important to get a better window on the facts.  Police officers aren't perfect, but they generally do join the force because they want to protect vulnerable people.  I've been amazed at the extra mile some of them will go to disclose information to a relevant agency, if they feel that information will protect a child or a vulnerable adult from further harm.  This information is not available to the general public, and specific protocols are in place to share the information.  You must also have given permission for this information to be requested by the investigating authority, and there are very tight controls.  Your employer could not request this information, for example, even in the name of an eCRB... but yes, it's out there.

You clearly have no experience of running a retail business. You certainly have never been to the wholesalers shops buy stuff from nor been involved in deciding the pricing.

Its 20p maximum charge if they use the card machine once a month. Judging by how much I found the very same parceltape for in a pound shop they made enough markup to cover the 20p and then some. In a town with massive unemployment, businesses closing left right and center where they sell a fairly niche product in that town that people can get cheaper elsewhere that they'd have been happy for any business they got.

&gt; Also, an item priced less than £5 has a very low profit margin

Actually low priced items under £5 tend to have the highest profit margin which just demonstrates just how little experience you have of retail purchasing and pricing. That bottle of Coke or Mars Bar you buy at the local shop or petrol station will have &gt;100% markup.

If you want to confirm the rental part? Now you know approximately how much money you've got to play with, have a look through Rightmove. In my neck of the woods there are a properties that are affordable for claimants on JSA, but most of them are from landlords who won't rent to people on welfare. So the actual pool of properties available to claimants is actually on the low side. 

Add into that, an unfortunate abundance of claimants, and you have a situation where landlords, based on our data, are increasing the price of shared accommodation properties faster than other types of accommodation. 

Shared accommodation rents have increased by approx. 10% in the last year, compared to a decrease of 2.5% for one bedroom properties, for example. Again, that's only in the immediate area in which I work - it'll differ in other parts of the country.

Now, assuming you *can* get a property? Most of them aren't exactly spectacular. I know student accommodation is hardly totes amaze, to turn a phrase, but the state of some shared accommodation leaves a lot to be desired.

As for financial costs? I assume you're factoring in utility payments [gas, electric, water rates], and the fact you can't supplement - legally - your income,where as students can get part-time jobs, to bring in a little extra money.

More importantly? Being on JSA looks to potential employers as if you're sitting on your arse doing nothing, irrespective of if that's true or not.

Such reasons include:

 - ""It's not very much"": Not the point, it's not what you agreed to.
 - ""It won't really affect you because of how you use your phone"": Not the point. For all you know my circumstances (and hence how I use my phone) might be about to change and I might have chosen this tariff for precisely that reason.
 - ""We're allowed to per the contract"": Please advise me which clause in the contract allows you to. (Always have your contract to hand when you ask this question so you can rebut it immediately).
 - ""There's nothing in the contract to say we can't"": No, but there is something in the contract to say that if you make changes, I have the right to break it without penalty.
 - (if you aren't directly with O2/Orange/Whoever but instead go through a billing provider like Phones 4 U or Carphone Warehouse) ""This is being forced upon us by the network; we don't have any choice"": Not my problem. If they are thrusting a change upon you that forces you to do this to all your customers, I suggest you raise it with them.
 - ""Every other network does this"": Not the point. I don't have a contract with any other network, I have a contract with you.


By the way, your comment about emphasising that you realise this is not the fault of the person you're talking to: Excellent advice. An awful lot of call centre staff seem to take such complaints as a personal insult and if they do that with you, you've immediately lost the battle because why would they want to help someone who's called up just to insult them?

Once you break it down, the argument that the welfare budget should be cut because it is the biggest strain fades away, since the majority of it goes into areas that nobody would dream of cutting (pensions). 

On top of that, the idea that are welfare programme is generous is a joke. Their are only 4 other countries in europe who have lower unemployment benefit than us. Job seekers allowance is £60 a week.

But private landlords catering to students. They can be a lot cheaper than private landlords catering to the general population. Maybe they are shitter properties and they think maybe students don't know their rights so well. And also I think some are trying some tax loops which is a  lot easier when you can get a student to pay in cash who doesn't need to pay council tax. Okay tbh IDK.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"I understand what you're saying, and agree to some extent with your points about the Left/Right spectrum being too simplistic a method to analyse the origins of a political movement, but I nevertheless still feel the concerted effort from the Right, to try and shift blame for the Nazis onto the Left, is outrageously disingenuous. I can understand their desire to distance themselves from the most extreme implementation of their ideology – I'm sure most on the Left would prefer not to be associated in any way with the worst examples of communism, but there is simply no denying that communism *is* the product of Left wing ideology. 

Of course, Leftists often try to blame Western capitalism for the failures of communism – and that argument does carry *some* weight, in that almost every communist experiment ever has faced external interference from capitalist forces; the USA's illegal supply of arms  to the Contras in Nicaragua, for example – but that signally fails to explain the worst excesses of *powerful* communist regimes in Russia and China, or atrocities perpetrated by dictators like Pol Pot, Kim Il Sung, etc..

My point being, that describing a political movement as Left or Right may ignore nuance and inevitable ideological crossovers, but there is a strong historical precedence for doing so – especially when the movement in question is extremist at its core.  

&gt;The real crux of debates like this is whether concepts such as nationalism and racism are fundamentally right wing. 

I don't agree that *is* the real crux of debates like this – and it's not what I've been trying to say. My contention is that it's the *supremacist* mindset that is fundamentally Right wing. Nationalism is too broad a concept to be ascribed to the Left or the Right as a whole. But there are two distinct forms of nationalism: one arising from the desire to escape perceived oppression or exploitation – see separatist movements like the SNP, Basques, etc. – and the other arising from a sense of regional/racial superiority. The former can't really be said to be Left or Right in any generalised way; but the latter is noticeably more favoured amongst Right/Conservative thinkers – you know: the 'My country right or wrong' brigade – and decried by Left/Socialist thinkers. So although nationalism generally is a cross-spectrum concept, I don't think it's unreasonable to describe the supremacist form of it as being Right wing.

As for racism: well again, I don't think it is fundamentally Right wing, but an inevitable consequence of their form of nationalism rather than an underlying principle of their ideology. In their case, it is a symptom rather than a cause, if you will. Racism, at its heart, is just the human expression of an instinctive animal trait to fear and distrust outsiders. There is an inherent evolutionary imperative for most animals to exercise extreme caution when dealing with unknown members of their own species, because they are frequently a significant threat to their very existence or the continuation of their genetic line. Thankfully, human civilisation has made our own interactions with others far safer, thereby giving us the confidence to overcome our natural instincts. But nationalism that seeks isolation from – rather than co-operation with – outsiders, panders to these instincts and therefore breeds xenophobia and racism.",0,1362315465,null,0,1362315746,0,c8ow6t0,t3_19fric,t1_c8ow6t0,t1_c8onpoq,null,1431467677,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The problem is that for every one of them there are many more who *aren't* highly competent or *aren't* highly skilled or are outright malicious or simply stupid...and it's somewhere between very hard and impossible to distribute guns to the former without distributing enough to the latter that everyone becomes less safe.

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"&gt; I also have a worry that I will get to my 40s and not understand the technology that ""the kids"" use.

I don't think this is irrevocably tied to age. The reason so many middle aged and older people find technology difficult to use is that they don't *start* using it until it's unavoidable.

For example, my mum (early fifties), and my brother (18) both still use basic mobile phones, and have zero experience with touchscreens or apps... Where does it look like the future of home computing is going? Yep, touchscreen PCs and app based user interfaces. When their current computers finally needs replacing, this is likely to be the most common option, and they're going to struggle hugely learning to use it because it's *too* different to what they're used to. It won't be in any way intuitive to them because they haven't experienced any of the between stages. And that goes for both of them, regardless of age.

Fair enough, it never even occurred to me to buy a smartphone until a year ago (I'm 24), and I was the among the last of my friends to use social networking and even texting and email, but once these things started to become dominant, I started using them. When the next evolutionary stage came along, I always had a decent enough working knowledge of the old technology to form a foundation for learning to use the new. When I bought my new computer and it came preloaded with Windows 8, I had enough working knowledge of my smartphone (apps, swiping to do stuff) and Windows 7 (Microsoft terminology) to figure out how to use it pretty quickly through a process of educated trial and error.

The other big problem for my mum especially is that she's never really learnt how to formulate an effective search term, or find the most appropriate result, which means she can't simply Google the problem like I can. I am trying to teach her how to do this, but it's a long process.

Depending on what level you're at now, you might not have as in depth an understanding of how it all works as you get older and other facets of life take precedence, but there is absolutely no reason getting older should mean you can't *use* at least the most dominant forms of new technology.

TL;DR Learn to google properly and keep aware of major changes as they happen, and you'll be fine.",0,1362321119,null,0,false,0,c8owwf3,t3_19j7xb,t1_c8owwf3,t1_c8omlsz,null,1431468014,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

£20k is a 12.5% deposit on a £160k house, which is the average price according to the land registry. It's doable. Of course if you have a partner then it's much easier to save and repay a mortgage, it's not all doom and gloom.

I daresay there are other, more benign, reasons for market researching, that one might more fairly describe as ""genuine,"" but I think they are far fewer in number than the other type. Certainly, that's been my experience.

Well for a start, for the second [third?] year running we have the highest percentage of closed shops, for a town of our size, in the country. Our councillors blame this on the sampling data not taking into account ""correct borders"".

They said the same last year.

The town centre contains a statue to the great Duncan Edwards [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Edwards] - the only people who ever seen to notice it, are real Manchester United fans, who'll have a look at it, whenever United are in the area, before nipping over to his grave, which is just up the road.

The place is full of discount stores - indeed, such is the prevalence of them that:


1: A recent[ish] BBC Programme, *Pound Shop Wars* featured the opening of a new 99p store... in Dudley.

2: We're home to the first Poundland in the country to permanently reduce their prices to ninety five pence.

The first passes the highest peak in the mountain range - Pen-y-Fan, and with only a short detour you could take in waterfall country at the head of the Neath Valley (check out Sgwd yr Eira - you can walk behind it!). The second passes Craig y Nos castle and the fanastic caves at Dan yr Ogof (try to ignore the tacky dinosaurs!). The third takes you closest to Carreg Cennen, though I'd imagine you'd have to loop round to Llandeilo once you cross the mountain to reach the castle - I have no idea how good the country lanes are around there. 

You'll get the best views of the mountains from the first route, the second will be quieter (once you're past Hirwaun at least), and with the third there would be less of a detour.

You're spoiled for choice after Carreg Cennen. The roads are pretty good and the scenery pretty beautiful through Powys. Alternatively you could head up through Lampeter to Aberaeron and head up the coast from there. I think I'd recommend that route - Aberaeron is an absolutely beautiful fishing village. Aberystwyth is also an interesting place to visit, and if you're lucky with the weather you can get fantastic views up the coast to Snowdonia.

The buidlings aren't very pretty but we did get bombed pretty badly during WWII.  We still have a nice medieval quarter next to the Cathedral ruins I suppose.  Most of the listed buildings aren't kept up very well and have become dilapidated.  The old Grammar School in the city centre near the Transport Museum) has boarded up windows and is covered in graffiti.  As a History student it makes me sad to see how little respect and attention is given to quite important landmarks in Coventry's history.

As far as shops go, we have a Primark and a Starbucks.  Most people just train hop to  B'ham for proper shopping.  The parade near my house has about 7 charity shops.  The butchers and the grocers closed down during the recession.

I live next to a small park and we have the War Memorial Park too.  All recreational spaces in Coventry seem to be used for recreational drug use and not much else.

Your typical Coventrian does not know that the letter T exists.  Water becomes WOR-ah and so on.  I am one of the lucky few with the ability to enunciate correctly.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"No, it's not misleading that it's named that way. It's called the European Convention of Human Rights because it sets down a series of minimal requirements that European states have agreed to be necessary for a fair and democratic society.

You can of course go above and beyond those duties, but there are exceedingly few legitimate reasons to violate any article of the ECHR. Even the whole prisoner voting rights fiasco is nothing like as bad as the press made out: the state *can* deny prisoners the right to vote, but it must justify doing this based on the specifics of that prisoner - rather than purely because they're in prison.

&gt; I would appreciate some sort of list of what ECHR has actually done to benefit the average UK citizen.

Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK, copy and pasted from a previous comment I wrote:-

* Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
* Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
* You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
* It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK)
* You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
* Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
* Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
* Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

&gt;  Myself, and 99% of the UK population aren't qualified to make a decision on this.

Whenever people from other countrys ask me where I live I tend to say Leeds because people have actually heard of it, I actually live in Wakefield which is rather close to Leeds but without the hustle &amp; bustle, jobs, prosperity etc.

Wakefield is famous for 3 things really: 

* ""The Westgate Run"" Which was apparently the longest club crawl in the UK. I find this hard to believe really, they must be using some really vague measure.
 
* 1 of 3 Towns operating in the ""World Famous"" Rhubarb Triangle.

* Wakefield Maximum Security Prison which is the largest Prison in the UK, depicted in the rhyme ""Here we go round the mulberry bush"" and host to those fabulous pillars of society Charles Bronson, Harold Shipman &amp; Iain Huntley (/sarcasm).

Speaking of pillars of society our most famous export is that cruise ship worbling Jane Mcdonald lass!

That's you.

&gt;If somebody is earning £1,000,000 a month it is practically impossible (yes i know it is actually possible) to spend that every month. They save it, keep it to pass down to their children etc. I'm not saying they don't spend any money, they do. They spend alot of money. But if you are already earning say £1,000,000 a month and you spend £500,000 of that a month then having a tax cut that gives you an extra £200,000 will not make you spend anymore.

When you put money in the bank or a hedge fund, where do you think it goes? It doesn't just sit in a vault, it's actually spent somewhere.

&gt;With regards to your point about welfare being money that is stolen. By that logic all tax is stealing money. People have no choice about being born into a society, people have no choice about part of that society they are born into and because we do not have enough jobs to go around people do not have a choice about being unemployed.

It is stolen, they take the money from one man's pay cheque and give it to another guy that didn't do anything to earn it. If someone takes 30% of my income without my permission I would call that theft. Just because the thief doesn't have a job it doesn't give him a right to rob me.

But again, you're going back to this idea that jobs are finite. There's plenty of wealth going around and you can tap into that. Don't talk about employment as if it's something you can only find in a job centre.

&gt;Given that is the case and that these people are then expected to live by the rules that govern society, and to contribute to the rich's of those people who run big buisness when they do have money, why is it stealing if we redistribute people income so that the poorest can survive and then make are society a healthier society? 

Because it's not your money to take, earn your own.

&gt;With regards to you saying that people are not trying or they are living in an area of low investment. If i play along with your obsession with investment, then the whole country is a low area of investment because their are not enough jobs in every area of the country to go around. So then what is your suggestion? the the unemployed invest the money they do not have into business?

The country is lacking in investment because the government taxes too much so no one has any money to spend. But it's also because too many people have lost the motivation to start businesses. Schools teach kids to leave school, attend university and then find employment at a large company. If everyone did that how would there be any large companies?

&gt;with regards to what when you say welfare recipeints are not the poor. So then your definition of 'the poor' is not how much money an individual has? People on welfare are almost always worse of than those who have a job unless they have children to support in some circumstances. If you do not define poverty based on how much money you have then you are simply to illogical to argue with. 

The poor are the people with very low incomes. You keep calling welfare recipients ""the poor"". They may be poor but they are not the vast majority of the poor people in this country. Cutting welfare does not hurt ""the poor"" it hurts the welfare recipients. It's quite a ridiculous attempt to create class warfare. I bet you call bankers ""the rich"" too.

&gt;Having an army protects the state, which ultimately means it protects citizens of the state from coming to harm. But cutting welfare puts those citizens back in harms way and what your suggesting would lead to their death. So why is it logical to pay tax for one thing that prevents death but not another thing that prevents death?

Come off it, this is ridiculous. The Crown isn't there as a safety net, it's there to defend the Realm. people need to take responsibility for their own finances.

&gt;Initiative is not an answer. Initiative does not change turn crap into gold. Initiative is just a cop-out. Pretty much the only loans people on welfare can get are pay-day loans that put them into more debt. People on welfare can certainly not afford to get a loan big-enough to try and invest or start a new business. Even if they could, the majority of new business's fail (not because of red-tape, because of free-market principles) and so the majority of them would be put back into even further debt

How much do you think it costs to set up a market stall? Not that I've ever done it, but I wouldn't imagine it was much.

With hard work anything is possible.

&gt;because the rich already have enough money to invest in products and yet you seem to be suggesting that all they were waiting for to invest was just a little bit more money. 

More money means more investment. There's not point where they suddenly stop investing, that's not how finance works.

&gt;That is my argument, i understand that investers invest but why give investers more money to invest (when they already have enough to invest) if the demand is not their they can build as big a business as they want, it won't have any customers.

You're not giving them anything, you're letting them keep their own money. There are plenty of customers. There are 7 billion people on the planet.

&gt;That's why you cut the tax's at the bottom and not the top. cutting tax's at the top is just a waste of money. The fact is that demand is not their at the moment because people are being squeezed and have less money to spend. This in turn is leading 'investers' to not want to invest. 

I agree, I have been saying this since the start. You started talking about tax cuts for the rich. I want a tax allowance of £15,000.

&gt;Regulation is not making it to expensive. If a company is big enough to supply a country whilst basing itself somewhere else then in that case it will always choose country's like China were it can basically treat the workers like slaves.

This is the dumbest thing you've said yet. Regulation makes it incredibly expensive, I already explained why.

China is still fairly expensive, but it helps them that we've made ourselves uncompetitive. If it was cheaper and easier here then more would be produced here.

&gt;One thing that regulation does is protect the average worker from the exploitation of employers. We shouldn't say that companies need not be held accountable because it might discourage them from running their business. If they don't like it they can fuck off and other people will form a company to meet the demand. 

Except that I don't want to get rid of all regulation, I want to get rid of silly regulation. Just because something empowers the worker doesn't instantly make it a good regulation.

&gt;I'm sure their are unreasonable regulations, but that is not an argument against regulation. 

Now you're just erecting a straw man.

All one would have to do is cut off the bar and excess barrel and said pistol would be exactly the same size and be as concealable as the factory produced gun in the first place.

The point is licensed gun owners have no wish nor need to conceal a gun so banning them didn't make sense. It is the unsavoury characters of society who have a need to conceal and that is just as easy to do that now with a long barrelled handgun (and a cheap saw) as it was pre ban with a standard length handgun.

true,jvallis,pertwee,Pertwee,"I would agree with this if we had witnessed the show suffer. There have been slight changes to the show to make it more palatable to a contemporary audience like the occasional shift from Sci-fi show to Drama (I'm thinking The Girl Who Waited and The Doctor's Wife which are still Sci-fi but more focused on relationships and the emotions of the characters) and the show's format (a welcome change I think, I cannot imagine waiting 4/6 weeks or longer for a story to conclude.). 

Part of the joy of these slight changes is being able to share a show you fundamentally connect to with other people who are perhaps, more casual viewers and yet, if you want, you can still learn and investigate the whole universe down to the tiniest detail and essentially know the show (something that I love).

Looking at the year ahead I think will give a clearer indication of how the show has changed. As more is revealed about the 50th anniversary we should be able to mark how much the show is similar or dissimilar to the 'cult' viewing we love. The BBC knows that Doctor Who has a devoted fan base who have followed them for the past 30 or so years but as much as the show is about the old fans, it is also about the new.

Okay maybe I haven’t drawn a conclusion and in a drunken rambling gone nowhere but this is what was in my head and you’ll have to endure that.

Will they ever understand how much it sucks to be beaten up for being a nerd? Maybe not. But perhaps people give them crap about other things. Everybody stands against popularity in one way or another.

Nobody can control what time period they're born in. People shouldn't have to suffer to be considered a nerd. This ""my sufferings were greater than yours"" isn't a good argument because it just belittles what these ""younger"" nerds went through because it ""doesn't compare"". I'm a newer nerd and what I'm hearing from you, is that the crap I went through doesn't matter because I didn't get physically beaten up. And because I didn't, I can't be a nerd the same way you are.

edit: Maybe you feel like the true meaning of what it is to be a nerd is being diluted by all these newbies who didn't have the same experiences as you, but I think that the definition of nerd is different now.

His runs were often mistimed, so he ended up in an off-side position more often than not. Unfornate, yes. Bad, maybe. But at least he's trying to help set something up. Create space.

He does this the whole game long. Getting on the end of long balls, distributing them onto other palyers. I'm fairly convinced that Ade as a starter makes the other 10 players far better than the contribution of Defoe can make. 

When the ball was cleared out from the back, it was often aimed at Ade, who had decent succes with containing possession of the ball.

The UK economy is out of balance. It has been out of balance since Margaret Thatcher took the reigns off the banks. She deregulated the banking system, Labour went along with it, and now here we are. 

The banks went crazy and started to make shit loads of money due to their new freedom. However, human greed came knocking. Human greed said to the bankers: 'Maybe we can get more, more, more'. The banks pushed it so far that everything collapsed.

Meanwhile manufacturing was declining in the face of a rising Dragon (China) and public services were sold for bottom dollar. The economy was heavily weighted towards financial services.

However, this isn't the entire story. In 1964 a film by the name of 'Mary Poppins' was made by Disney. In one scene, when the father tries to force the kids to open bank accounts, the old bank manager sings a song. At the end he collapses and says: 'If the banks of England fall, England falls'.

The last reason on your list is wrong, and actually the reason why most people who live in London stay in London, and the reason they put up with all the other things you listed. London is probably the only place in the UK where for most people you can literally find a job tomorrow if you become unemployed. There was no recession here.

Also, there are large parts of London that aren't like you described. You've used a very stereotypical impression of London which makes me think you've only seen it for a few hours as tourist. London has some of the biggest green spaces and parks of any city in the country, and a lot of people live and work outside the tiny square mile area of central London in greater London, where for example they can walk or cycle through Richmond park past the deer on the way to work in the morning, work in a lovely office by the river in Richmond, have some world class food for dinner and then conveniently get a taxi home in the evening.

The idea that girls dressing as Leia is attention seeking is pretty annoying to me. I've heard this one before. Geek girls who don't actually like the franchise, they just want attention by dressing that way. Maybe they're not nerds/geeks at all, they just liked the costume design and wanted to use it. Maybe they just recently became a fan. Who knows. 

But so what if they don't know the difference? I'm a huge Star Trek fan but I haven't seen all the episodes. Everybody should be allowed to enjoy the franchise without having to establish their nerd/geek cred first. Otherwise it becomes the reverse of what happened back in the day. Older geeks start policing younger geeks.

This particular example really bugs me though. I just hate it. Some person with a passion for creating clothes and doing cosplay pours hours of work into an outfit they like. They take pride in it. They want to have fun wearing it, and they want to present their artwork to the world (like a painter) but then they get shot down and called an attention seeker because they don't know the franchise well enough. And it always happens to female cosplayers more too. Urgh.

The only kind of respect I give to the older nerds is that they must really know their stuff. But nobody knows if the people of today would've suffered like you did if they happened to have been born in your time period. They could've been you for all anybody knows.

Yes, there are always going to be some people who piggy-back on the title for attention but that applies to any subculture and it doesn't mean everybody is doing it. Or even a fourth of people. I expect only a small fraction do this. So when such a small fraction of people are ""phonies"", I don't find the justification that ""some people are just attention seekers"" good enough.

Also can i just say that the only reason you would have a Katana on display is for the cosmetic reason. It's still a weapon, it was too designed to be functional during times of war. The only reason people see them differently is because Hollywood and storytellers have glamorized them to such an extent we find them fascinating to look at. 

Maybe in a hundred years from now we will have new types of weapons and people will look back at the old ones and think wow for the technology they had back then this is really impressive. 

Just because something gets a lot of bad publicity doesn't mean it is bad, just because gangs use them doesn't mean they should be banned. 

I personally find them beautiful to look at, all of the intricate details that go into making them the Assembly of them all of these things are works of art in their own right, the advances in accuracy the rifling the ability to get a tiny firing pin to strike the end of a bullet time and time again and actually survive. 

Also the fact that you say there is no beauty in the history of guns shows a clear lack of education from where they began. (No it wasn't the war that made us make them) please do some research and then think again about what you have said.

Yes it's true we wanted to make a more deadly and powerful gun, we also wanted to make them with the best materials we could, we also wanted it to go further and be more accurate. This has meant that we have learned a lot about making things smaller and more powerful (not just weapons) we have been able to make tools more accurately, such as scalpels. 

Guns have also helped us with machine pressing and they have enabled us to machine to even finer tolerances. These advances has helped us out a lot. If we hadn't invested the time in making things smaller and stronger the computer you are using now probably wouldn't work or even exist. The mobile phone you have would be huge if it was even a thing at all. 

Let me ask you this if a gun can kill a person can it not also save another. The gun just gives an advantage when it comes to the fight or flight response we all have, and have had for many years.

However, ""You no longer are just ""uneducated about the game"", you are dumb and just plain wrong."" ruined it for me.  You perch a bit high on your horse in thinking this way.  Otherwise, I totally agree, people that expect Ade to be scoring wonder goals from outside the box with beautifully executed volleys don't understand the type of player he is.  He isn't a player like Falcao who could potentially score with any touch he has in the opposition's half.  I don't think excessive criticism of Adebayor is warranted at this point, because of what we had available, he was our best bet to play well against Arsenal.  However, I do think criticism is warranted in general from him.  No, he isn't scoring goals, which is perfectly fine because his role doesn't concentrate around that specifically.  However, he also hasn't necessarily been great at what he has been expected to do either.  His hold up play has been extremely hit and miss since he became the only striker we had available.  His touch has been quite mediocre.  Too many times has he attempted to control the ball and accidentally put the ball feet in front of himself.  I personally thought Defoe looked good for when he was on, especially in his passing and movement for once.  I don't think either is suitable for what we aspire for.  Adebayor of last year certainly could be wonderful in the Champions League, but if we truly aspire to compete in that as well as maintaining top-4 finishes every year, I don't think either Defoe or Adebayor have been good enough to warrant not looking for a better replacement.",0,1362344267,null,0,false,0,c8p32u4,t3_19ldu9,t1_c8p32u4,t3_19ldu9,null,1431471078,30,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,30

Steal from old ladies? This story is from second-hand experience: someone from Sandy Row (another Protestant inner-city area) decided to rob old ladies. He had to wear a big board and walk around city centre on the weekend or else get kneecapped. 

Kneecapping is a lot more regular than the statistics would show, nearly everyone won't report it though.

If you would like to educate yourself then watch www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckrycABiJDE&amp;t=100

Anything not crafted in this way is not a real katana, as i said in an earlier reply you can make something that looks 'like' a katana from any curved bit of metal but the difference is that it isnt made from steal that has been folded many times to give it an incredibly hard outer edge for cutting power with a slightly softer inside that makes the blade able to be so long without being brittle, the curve of the blade comes from the crafting not just because someone decided it 'looks pretty'. The fine crafting of the sword is something that enables it to be treated as a piece of art the way in which fine china is differentiated from cheap cups and plates

People the world over that know anything treat katanas as art pieces, They are controlled exports as art pieces by the dept of culture in japan.

Guns were created as efficient ways to kill lots of people, quickly and en-masse, you dont stand toe to toe with your opponent and challenge them, you fire at them from safe distance. 

A guns parts are cast, which is why they can be printed, people have already printed guns that have worked briefly but they usually fall apart pretty quickly because the plastic doesnt hold up to the forces whereas cast metal would. The most complex part of a gun and the only part that couldnt be cast is the spring

These are the reasons that guns overtook swords as weapons, their simplicity enabled them to be mass produced and not having to stand toe to toe meant you had less risk of loosing soldiers. The difference is that the only way a gun becomes a collectors or display piece is if it belonged to a particular person, its not in itself at all special only by association from its owner.",0,1362347148,null,0,false,0,c8p3zen,t3_19jog1,t1_c8p3zen,t1_c8p1z1l,null,1431471543,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't think that's entirely true.  The main piece of anti-discrimination legislation is the Equality Act 2010, which is specifically limited to 9 ""protected characteristics"": age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage/civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, race, religion/beliefs, sex, and sexual orientation.  It also only bans certain kinds of discrimination, such as refusing employment or services based on these characteristics, and has a lot of exceptions.

The ban on discrimination in the European Convention on Human Rights is more open-ended: it has a similar list of characteristics which finishes with something like ""or other status"".  However, it only bans discrimination with respect to the other rights guaranteed by the convention.

&gt;In the United Kingdom, the Crown Estate is a property portfolio owned by the Crown.

Basically, she owns the crown estates but chose to sign them away to the government for her reign. When Charles succeeds, he could choose to not do so (each monarch must do so - the Queen's decision wouldn't carry over to Charles) and thus they would once more be the monarch's private property.

Anyway, I know he's young, but I personally do not see what others see in him.  I think he started the season pretty well and was actually playing with some confidence.  But my dark lord, has he been poor recently.  I just honestly can't name a facet of the game where he shows great ability.  His finishing has been poor (missing several sitters), he's misplaced many passes, long shots end up in the stands far too often, rash tackling, lack of composure, not very technical, poor first touch, and yeah he certainly goes missing.  The only real positives are his determination, heart, passion, confidence, and his awesome celebration!  I do think that his mental attributes will take him pretty far, but not at a consistent starting 11 level.  Again, this is just my opinion based on the few opportunities that I have seen him play.  I really want him to succeed  at Liverpool, but I think we need to stop comparing him to a young Gerrard (not saying you are, but many people on this sub have in the past).

So it's really just a question of what. Clearly I make no bones about believing they were of the Right; just as I freely admit Stalin's USSR and Mao's China were of the Left. So it's true that I baulk at any suggestion they were of the Left – and it especially irks me when the misnomer in their name is cited as evidence of such – so perhaps I am inclined to overstate their Right wing credentials when I encounter that.

You're also quite right that these extreme movements have more in common than not.

I'm a former HMV store manager and previously a Virgin Megastore manager. I know what our margins were, and this was 4 years ago when I left HMV to move to a fashion retailer. CD prices have actually fallen, yet still have the same margin. Gone are the days when they would make £5 from a £16.99 cd.

As far as smaller items having a bigger profit margin, that's true to an extent, depending on the item. Game retailers make more money off of the generic brand accessory they have generously added to your bundle, than the £300 console itself.

I was referring to actual small transactions as opposed to buying one cheap item. If its a branded item then the margin is generally quite low, which is why corner shops are noticeably more pricey than a Tesco or ASDA.

The legislation was blocked *at the request of the government*.  So, it was not the Queen or the Prince abusing their powers, but the government making use of normal constitutional procedure to kill bills that they didn't want to debate.  No undue influence here.

&gt;…and also pointed out that the Queen was directly pressing ministers about Abu Hamza…

As far as I recall, her comments on this were pretty much limited to clarifying that he had broken no laws that would allow for his arrest.  There was no attempt to direct or change policy or legislation.  Can you provide a reliable source that states otherwise?  If not, then there is no evidence of undue influence here, just the Queen asking questions in a briefing.

&gt;…and we know that Prince Charles has a ""spy"" in the Cabinet Office…

Not much evidence of anything here yet; the only person running with it is Guido.  Certainly no evidence so far  of this unnamed employee influencing policy or legislation.  We'll just have to wait and see.

I have mixed views about private healthcare. I had really bad stomach aches for about 2 years. The NHS was terrible at diagnosing what was wrong, 10+ GP visits plus hospital visits. When I got private through my new job I got referred to a specialist who ordered a colonoscopy next day and I got diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. 

I was very impressed with the service so decided to stay with the consultant for treatment. BIG MISTAKE. He just ordered a barrage of tests and way more colonscopy's than I really needed (each one was charged to BUPA at £1,200 a pop). They are really unpleasant and couldn't understand why I had so many. Found out later the clinic was in financial trouble and has since gone bust. A worrying aspect of bringing private money into healthcare. The medication he put me on was also pretty shit. I kept getting worse, and rather than up my treatment I just had more testing. I got more and more sick and ended up having to be rushed to hospital and almost had to have my colon removed. 

The NHS had far more resources to help me and I ended up getting put on a medication that isn't covered by BUPA purely based on cost. I've got a team of NHS nurses I can call at any time, and have been in great health ever since. 

tl:dr, I think private is great for diagnosis, simple procedures and treatments.

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"&gt;When you put money in the bank or a hedge fund, where do you think it goes? It doesn't just sit in a vault, it's actually spent somewhere.

But that's not the point you made is it. your backtracking. you said that if you give people more money they will invest more. now you are saying if you give people more money then there will be more money in the banks and the banks will invest more. you change your answers when your proved wrong and ignore the points i make.

&gt;It is stolen, they take the money from one man's pay cheque and give it to another guy that didn't do anything to earn it. If someone takes 30% of my income without my permission I would call that theft. Just because the thief doesn't have a job it doesn't give him a right to rob me.

One again here you are ignoring my point. Are you telling me that you believe all tax is wrong? This is an argument that all tax is wrong and yet you only seem to be arguing that tax that goes towards welfare is wrong. will you please explain this point you are making. if your answer is that you do not think all tax is wrong then you have to justify why you think tax that goes towards welfare is wrong in a way that doesnt actually argue against all tax on principle, which is what you have just done.

Also, although the amount of Jobs change over time, the amount of Jobs available are finite. You ask how much it would cost to set up a stall. the answer is to much for somebody who does not already have a job. How much do you think it costs to buy the produce and rent the space etc? The fact is that you are clearly ignorant of everyday life and you keep showing that.

You need money to start a business. Often in the form of loans and investment, but you still need money. This is unattainable to most people. 

Do you believe that everyone who is unemployed can successfully start up their own business?  Even if they could afford it which they cannot. 

I have another question for you; why does the 'crown' defend the 'Realm'?

&gt;The poor are the people with very low incomes. You keep calling welfare recipients ""the poor"". They may be poor but they are not the vast majority of the poor people in this country. Cutting welfare does not hurt ""the poor"" it hurts the welfare recipients. It's quite a ridiculous attempt to create class warfare. I bet you call bankers ""the rich"" too.

I never said they were the vast majority of poor in this country. you said they were not the poor and i said they were. now you have changed your mind. poverty is defined as living on less than a certain amount. it's not based on the source of your income. People on welfare have a low income. Just because that income comes from the state it does not disqualify them as the poor. Also, given that the majority of our welfare budget goes on the working poor, cutting welfare would hurt the 'poor' as you define them much more than the 'welfare poor'. 

&gt;More money means more investment. There's not point where they suddenly stop investing, that's not how finance works.

So you think that people keep on investing for ever, no matter how much money they have? you think the reason the rich do not invest now is because they do not have enough money? Idiot. You don't think they care about what their is to invest in?? You have a 12 year old's view of economic. you explain things via meaningless words without actually attempting to explain in detail how something might work.

If your so sure about your economic plan, take me through an example of someone who is given £60 a week on welfare and how they find a job via starting up a business. Also make sure your example can apply to all the unemployed, you quite obviously have no understanding of supply and demand.  


&gt;You're not giving them anything, you're letting them keep their own money. There are plenty of customers. There are 7 billion people on the planet.

Have you heard of the idea of the social contract and do you believe in it? Also, those 7 billion people on the planet have to be able to afford the products being sold to them. 

&gt;China is still fairly expensive, but it helps them that we've made ourselves uncompetitive. If it was cheaper and easier here then more would be produced here.

Do you or do you not think that we could ever compete with the wages of workers in China? If the answer is yes, do you think we should? If the answer is no to either of these questions, How would we remain competitive on these terms as you have previously said? 

&gt;Except that I don't want to get rid of all regulation, I want to get rid of silly regulation. Just because something empowers the worker doesn't instantly make it a good regulation.

Obviously this would entail another conversation about what we think is silly and non-silly regulation. Lets just assume we would disagree.

It absolutely would.

Human rights aren't political rights, generally. When someone says freedom of speech is a right in a modern democracy, they're not talking about the right of an every day person to go into a town square and say they hate tories or lefties. 

It is **always** the edge cases.

When an individual says he's not a terrorist, but he ""gets"" al-qaeda. 

When someone had a pretty fair trial, but the CPS were sloppy with one aspect of the prosecution.

When a definite and unquestionable paedophile was prosecuted based on evidence that was obtained illegally.

All of those are things that the public would, politically, be quite mixed in their opinion. 

The British constitution has few normative 'rights', and of those almost none are known: the British constitution and common law acknowledges **some sort** of right to free speech, but it's ambit has never been defined.

Beyond that, Parliament can utterly lance through **any** British right people have. And most people don't care so long as it doesn't affect them. 

The biggest merit of the ECHR is that is secures rights for the poor, downtrodden, immigrants, 'sexual deviants', or whatever other group isn't politically shielded from legislative abuse.

true,FallenFaerie,tardis,TARDIS,"I want to preface this by saying that I am by no means an expert on bipolar or depression. I speak only of two particular cases in my life to offer insight to how I view these differences. I know very well that every case can be different no matter how similar they are in theory. And I definitely cannot offer any medical help or otherwise. If you need help, seek professional and proper help. 

Bipolar is a bit different but usually closely related. The way I see it, in bipolar, every up is met with an equal down and every down is met with an equal up. Think of it like a wave with a midpoint of zero, down are of course negative numbers and ups are respectively positive numbers. If a bipolar hits an up with a party or friends being over and reaches 20 while hanging out, they will most likely immediately crash out later with -20 to bring the scale back to 0 and bringing themselves back to what they call a lucidity period. 

Experiencing bipolar for a bit myself, there is also a bit of a time equality needed to keep the scales balanced. If I was happy at 20 for 3 hours, I usually needed to balance that out with 3 hours down at -20. The math gets a little fuzzy and reality doesn't follow exactly balanced, so sometimes I'd only dip down to -10 after a 20 up, and something happy would swing me up again. And that's where the main trouble of bipolar falls. It's really difficult to cancel out a death in the family which could go down to -100 for the sake of numbers. Because that death lasts a really long time in your mind, adding more and more negatives each time. And it's hard to balance that out with something equally up when in a case like that people are usually reminding you of that down and not being able to do much in the way of bringing you up.

From how I saw depression, it does have it's ups and downs because depressed people can (but not all of them) feel happy and inspired even during their overall depression. Depression is definitely focused more on the downs. They find the negative in everything because (scientifically) they have a chemical imbalance that is lacking or pushing away the happy chemicals from getting into their brains. So they actually have this mental loop of negativity causing more negativity over and over and usually can't break it without a lot of training or with medication. So (if you like numbers) they have loops of a -1 down hitting their minds, causing a -2 to tack on, and then a -4, and -8 and then jump to a -16 and suddenly they are just crying uncontrollably and can't get out from this growing negativity. 

And sometimes they just exclude themselves, crash and fall asleep under the weight of it because that's all they can really do against it. And that's what I saw Van Gogh portrayed as doing. 

**Spoilers Ahead**

When I saw Van Gogh's pumped up times and happiness, I attributed that to having the outside help and support of his friends. When I saw Amy's excitement about changing Van Gogh's life and stopping his suicide and then the major disappointment when nothing changed, I saw reality. Van Gogh and found a bit of hope like many people do after inspiring talks and support of good friends, but then I saw regression which is very real and very powerful when he no longer had his friends to fall back on. Loss is a very powerful thing and in the episode, Van Gogh lost something very close to him.

**TL;DR** Bipolar and depression are similar but different in specific areas. Bipolar focuses much more on a balance between up and down, whereas depression focuses more on an inescapable negative loop. And overall I thought the portrayal of Van Gogh's depression was very real indeed. ",0,1362352416,null,0,false,0,c8p5myj,t3_19izls,t1_c8p5myj,t1_c8otsjk,null,1431472358,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/mayday/

&gt; The idea for Mayday came to us one night when we were watching Crimewatch. A heinous crime had been described and the man responsible was of unusual depravity and evil. The public were duly asked to contact the studio if they knew of any persons who lived in the vicinity of the horror who matched that description. Later, during the update, it was revealed that three people had called in, each naming a possible suspect. Assuming that one of the names led to the man described, that meant that there were at least two other people who knew someone they believed was capable of committing a terrible crime. We found this fascinating.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"Leeds. Not as awful as Welthaupstadt Morley where I grew up. I live in a student area (which is horrid) with idiots (which is horrid). The city centre is alright though. There is usually something going on and we have a big pedestrianized area in the middle so there are often street musicians and the sort of things that, on a sunny day, make somewhere really feel like a nice place to live. Unfortunately sunny days in West Yorkshire are about once a decade. A lot of the smaller, alternative shops seem to be vanishing, meaning that most shops are either boring franchises or horribly overpriced or both.

With a new, huge shopping centre about to be opened, and an arena nearing completion, hopefully Leeds will see a bit more money coming into it so things can continue to develop and lease prices on retail units will drop a bit so alternative places can flourish again. The problem is that pedestrian foot traffic is king and quite a lot of places in Leeds, even centrally, see very little of it. Shopping centres sabotage themselves by asking for tons of money to lease them and expecting massive companies to move in. What they ought to be doing is asking for less money and casting their net more narrowly to make themselves a 'destination' for a particular subculture. The Grand Arcade and that Cube place are more or less completely empty and get almost no foot traffic whatsoever. If they chose a target market, and advertised themselves as 'Leeds' Best Destination for' whatever the target market want, shops of that type would rush in and they'd end up much busier and fully leased.

true,tfw13579,flair8,,"To start, the beginning of your post was absolutely unfair and because of it, you had no credibility to back up your argument. There is a reason that there have been so many Ade haters recently and its because Adebayor has been crap. Saying that I don't understand football because of it is completely unfair. 

I won't criticize a player without backing it up, so here it goes. The obvious reason is that Adebayor has been terrible with his finishing as of late. He has missed sitters and it has cost us from time to time. For your second point in judging him, I disagree that he has been good at holding up the ball. I believe that he has been absolutely terrible about it. Time after time, a bad touch or a little bit of laziness will cause him to lose the ball that he should be holding up with ease. For example, right before he gets a yellow, he takes a terrible touch, losses possession, then proceeds to take out whoever stole it from him. For it to happen as much as it does is inexcusable. Every now and then he'll do it well, like your example, but the majority of the time he does not.

To judge him based on your third point, I would also disagree with your statement. He makes some good runs every now and then, like the one you pointed out, but he strays offside way to much for a lot of them to even matter. I counted that he was offside about 3 times in the game, and there were countless other times when he was off and it wasn't passed to him because of it. I wouldn't mind as much if he worked hard to get back on, but he doesn't do that. He has been too lazy this season and it is something that can not be forgiven for somebody with his talent and for the amount he has been paid. 

I would much rather have Defoe on the field then him because he actually thinks. Defoe is just as good at making runs as Ade and also stays onside much more often. It is also nice to have a striker that can actually pose a threat to the other teams goal. His hold up play isn't as great but he compensates by getting into better positions then Ade.

true,Lit-Up,cnty-uk,Republican,"&gt;Most people vote for the party not the person, that means we will get whichever shit Labour or Tory put up.

[No, you wouldn't. The Irish presidency was contested by three candidates from major parties, and by five independents. All you need to contest the election is get support from 20 members of parliament, so it's pretty open.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_presidential_election) The debate itself is fantastic as it really makes the nation think about where they are existentially and who they want representing them in this important role. The election occurs every seven years.

The current system of monarchy actually perpetuates the shit that Labour and Tories put up generally. This is because  the institution of the monarchy is the source of all power in the land. A key feature of the constitution is the continuation of arbitrary, unlimited and unaccountable power - all of which derive from the Crown. Most of these are exercised by the government, some continue to be exercised by the Queen. The Crown is what gives parliament and government its power, the monarch hands most of her personal powers directly to the prime minister, or allows ministers to exercise her powers through the Privy Council. The institution of monarchy gives unchecked power to the central government. The people barely get a look-in, being given only the occasional chance to participate in the formal political process. Reform that and we might have a better democracy.

&gt; Anybody that wants to be elected to President will have to whore themselves out to the media and lose the quiet dignity that the Queen so uniquely possesses out of anyone in public life.

Actually, the royal family does whore itself out to the media. The ruling class in this country have an abundance of power, influence and PR at their disposal. In fact it was Mark Bolland, former press officer for Prince Charles, who said in 2005 that ""the Windsors are very good at working three days a week, five months of a year and making it look as though they work hard"". He was of course part of that, it was his job to create that impression.

&gt; William is clearly a very capable, modern and bright man. And even Harry's military career is impressive.

Of course your impression of this is totally mediated by the royal family whoring themselves out to the media.

I'd venture that your admiration of the Royal family has more to do with you clinging to icons which you perceive to constitute your national identity. Perhaps elements of Britishness which are people based should be celebrated, rather than people who have their spot on the hierarchy because they emerged from the right vagina in the right order.",0,1362355901,null,0,1362356085,0,c8p6ogb,t3_19kvcc,t1_c8p6ogb,t1_c8p60cg,null,1435575746,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

true,ZZZBestInvestor,null,null,"When reading this please bear a few things in mind- for the purposes of helping me avoid writing an essay on the subject I will make generalizations. I am not being critical or negative of you nor your mother. Also, I read the Guardian.

The UK has a housing crisis and under utilization of existing housing, both private and social, is a big part of the problem.

The government is going to start reducing your benefits to account for the benefit in kind that is you living in a house that is larger than you require- note that I am making a  big assumption here that you are in social/council housing based on the fact your mother is on benefits.

In large parts of the country people get a better quality of life if they choose to take benefits and take council accommodation rather than get a job. In some situations the increase in quality of life is quite considerable.

People that work and have low paid jobs and also have to fork out for private rents get the shortest straw of all in our septic isles. If these people want a council house and there isn't one available then the local authority has to house them elsewhere, if they are deemed to be part of an 'at risk' group'- with private landlords or even in hotels and B&amp;B's. This is ruinously expensive. The gov cannot house multiple parties in a single council dwelling.

The new gov initiative is aimed at encouraging people whom are on benefits to either move to more appropriate council housing or to rent out their spare rooms to help reduce the housing crisis.

You can get £4000 or so a year tax free under a government scheme if you take in a lodger. If you took on a tenant, you could make more, but it would be subject to taxation and would legally make you a landlord. It may well also change your mothers welfare entitlements.

Am I concerned? No.

I think its an issue of necessity and that the Gov. has made a very fair, if unpopular, decision.

Why should someone get benefits and a larger house than they need? It is poor allocation of scarce resources and as importantly, not fair on other taxpayers.

That last part is the real issue for me. If someone has decided to kill you, they probably will - there's not a lot you can do about that. Having a gun to defend yourself is no good if the attack is a complete surprise.

Having a gun or a knife just gives a false sense of security - maybe you'll piss someone off that you wouldn't have otherwise.

Syria has been historically diverse with different religious groups living together and intermarrying but the sectarian nature of this particular regime (Alawite) has created and nurtured sectarianism as a survival mechanism. The Syrian regime aimed to concentrate power among the Alawite minority (via economic corruption, nepotism in the military and in government) and suppress the majority Sunni population as well as other non-Alawite minorities. 

Bashar Al-Assad began diversifying his regime by introducing more Sunnis into the military in an effort to prevent unrest but this was too little too late. Looking at the Syrian opposition, it is far more inclusive and diverse than the Assad dictatorship which relies heavily on a small number of Alawites and those close to the regime. There are legitimate concerns about foreign jihadists in Syria funded by Gulf states but these groups played a far bigger role in Libya than they are currently playing in Syria and Libya elected a secular, democratic government which had far more women elected than we have in Parliament. The current Syrian Transitional Council is more liberal than the Libyan National Council was and the influential role of George Sabra (a Syrian-Christian) as well as other minorities indicates it can act as a credible transitional governing body if the Assad regime were to fall.

Had to sell Ade and Dempsey to buy damiao though, cant say theyre missed too much. I don't like to play Sandro and dembele together in the mid because they both have high attacking and defensive work rates and they get gassed before a full 90 and I find large gaps in the mid when they're running all over the place. Usually one with Parker and one with Pogba who you can get on loan from juve for cheap.  bought schelotto in January I think, play him on the rw and he's a beast. Also snatched up Jovetic in my summer window and have been playing him at CAM, he's a 94 right now...enough said really. Score plenty from through balls to bale and Lennon, Jovetic scores from outside the area like its nobodies business and damiao does well cleaning up in the box and blasting in an occasional header.

&gt; Talk Back being Talk Back, however, it wasn’t long before sectarianism came into the equation and the punters wanted to know how the suicide rate breaks down between the two communities. **Eventually it transpired that Catholics are slightly more likely than Protestants to kill themselves.**

The problem is very evident in that the list system works in first come first serve, which is unfairly arbitrary and leads to people signing leases for houses they have never seen. While the letting agency might in the long term unify student housing under one central banner I feel it is far more likely that it will just add another competitor to an already confusing system. 

My policy is instead to create a unified list that would be created and publicised through the union, run by students but allowing the letters to manage their own lists on the website with photos and details of the house collected from the current tenants where possible. I have talked to a entrepreneur that has tried to set up something similar already but encountered some problems, mostly with letters not being happy with the extra work it may involve. However, as Association President I would be in a unique position to lobby Residence Business Services to come on board and as the single biggest letter in town, what they do is very influential to the others.

One thing not mentioned here is the absolute dearth of 2 bedroom (or for that matter 1 bedroom) properties available for the people being coerced to move out of 3 bedroom properties (which there are many more of), which means a lot of people in this situation don't get the option of moving to a smaller place. 

Likewise it makes no accomodation for special circumstances such as disability. For example a three bedroom house occupied by a married couple with one child, where one parent has a serious disability and has to sleep in a hospital-type bed in an adapted bedroom. All three rooms are in use, but according to this policy - that's too bad. Same if the house has had tens of thousands of adaptation for disability living - the policy doesn't make provision for it.

""If a bipolar hits an up with a party or friends being over and reaches 20 while hanging out, they will most likely immediately crash out later with -20 to bring the scale back to 0 and bringing themselves back to what they call a lucidity period.""

A manic episode is not caused by friends coming over.  It's a hormonal imbalance in the brain that is often caused by no outside influences and that description makes mania seem like it's just happy to be around friends.  That's extremely wrong.  Mania is scary and uncharacteristic and bizarre.  Sure, it can lead to increased desire to engage in social situations, but it can also lead to extreme anger and hate for people you would usually love.  In addition, a manic episode is not met immediately with an equal and opposite depressive episode.  It's possible that that can happen, but never guaranteed.  Nothing about Bipolar is guaranteed.

Also, you can't just be ""bipolar for a bit"".  If you have it you have it and if you don't you don't.  I'm actually a little offended by the way you're describing it.  You are very very misled in many of the things you're saying about it.  It's an intrinsic part of one's life that will be there forever.  

There is nothing about Bipolar disorder that is balanced.  God I wish there was some predictability or balance to it, then maybe I could get control over my life.  

People with Bipolar can suffer from years of deep dark depression without experiencing any stability or mania.  Then suddenly out of nowhere can find themselves in a severe manic state.  Or they can rapid cycle with severe ups and downs and uncharacteristic mood swings within a month, week, or day.  To re-iterate, however, the ups are not met with exactly equal downs hardly ever ever ever.  

The reason I said that Van Gogh in this episode reminded me of Bipolar was because it was a representation of metal suffering and each of us who experiences it is going to find something to relate to in it.  

His excited bouts of creativity and motivation coupled with his very sudden bed ridden fit throwing met with also his severe anger swings reminded me a lot of the confusion and suffering that comes with Bipolar swinging.

Two of my good friends have left Australia to move to Sheffield and I think they like the 'smallness' of it. One of them lived on Eccy road for a year and he loved that it had everything he needed.

Tesco, the nursery tavern, botanical gardens, eccy park and when he needed it, a bus to town.

I think because we come from a small-medium sized town then Sheffield is like a small step up from that. The issue they are having though is finding work. Its really competitive as locals and students are all looking so its proving difficult for them at the minute.

Having said that, we used to work in a warehouse that was 2 hours from the hostel we stayed at in melbourne so they're OK with commuting. Its crazy how I used to moan about it taking 30 minutes to get to work whereas now it takes me a minimum of an hour on public transport to get to any job aha.

You are right that ups and down do not always follow each other immediately nor do they cancel each other out perfectly. I was hoping to get that across in one of the later paragraphs. I will have to go back and change my wordings about some thing.

I do think that it is unfair of you to claim that I did or did not have bipolar. I was never diagnosed, true. But one can never fully understand how another feels no matter how they write/explain it and no matter how many corrections to those writings or explanations. And I'm sorry that my ""a bit"" wasn't more clear and precise for you. Again, we can never fully understand what a person means no matter how much they edit their words.

You are right though that your interpretation of the show is just as valid as anyone else's and I'm sorry that you took my explanations as if I was shooting those down. I meant to correct only because I thought Van Gogh, by history's sources, depressed though I and they could be wrong.

Depression and bipolar do have their overlapping so sometimes it is increasingly difficult to diagnose which one a person has. I do however feel that it is wrong of you to attack my experience without knowing me. Though, I assume you felt attacked yourself and again I am sorry about that.

I felt that tying the ups and downs to specific events could help explain things but I guess I didn't clarify that often these feelings come out of nowhere.

true,Agoldsmith1493,eng-kent,Kent,"Omg really, right can i just say before we get started the only thing that holds 3D printing back at the moment is the materials that are used, a CNC machine milling each piece of plastic to form a gun is **NOT** a 3D printer it is a **CNC** machine. Also if a 3D printer could use flexible materials then a spring could be printed.

3D printers use a special powder to create a model layer by layer building it. There are 3D printers that don't use powder however they grow the piece in the same way. 

Also can i just say that you could print a Katana given that the printer could use the materials that are used and at the right temperatures. The quenching of the metals does not make it special. The only difference being that the annealing is done by people not in huge factories, this process is the same that is used by hammer manufacturers. The hammers have a hard outer shell however the inner core is soft to allow for flexibility. 

Also what your doing by saying it has to be crafted in a particular way to make it a real Katana is false. It just so happens that the technique used happens to be the best method for making metals that are both hard and ductile all in the same piece of metal. It's all about ensuring that the crystals of the metal are aligned in a specific way. Yes the fact that a Katana has been made the same way for many years may be impressive to people that don't understand the methodology but to someone that does it's nothing more that simple engineering that given enough time and patience and the right materials anyone could make. The curve of the blade is also put there because it increases the surface area of the striking edge, it also means that the weight of the sword is closer to the center line of the pivot point thus making it easier to hold even though they are still heavy.

Also guns do not have to be owned by specific people to be a collectors item, yes there are guns that sell for stupid amounts because of this however there are guns that were made that are rare nowadays thus making them collectors items, this also pushes the prices up. I know what your trying to say but it's complete nonsense, a Katana is a weapon of war made for the same reasons as a gun to help protect the soldiers that are using it. It was made with the same intentions and the methods of making them were changed over many years for the same reason. To make the perfect weapon to kill someone one that isn't going to shatter when you hit it onto metal one that is ductile in the core yet brittle and hard on the outside. This is the same for guns first there were revolvers that were good until your opponent could get off more bullets quicker that you could. Then there were magazines created that automatically loaded the next bullet while the previous cartridge got ejected from the barrel. Then there were guns that were created to help reduce recoil and that could fire thousands of rounds a minute. 

The only reason you see Katana's differently from guns is because you have romanticized them along with many others. This is the reason guns are seen as bad and immoral. I mean seriously your more likely to get killed or hurt from a sword unintentionally than you are a gun because swords are kept sharp whereas guns have safety switches. Where's the safety on a Katana? it's nothing more than exotic metals beaten, quenched &amp; then annealed in such a way that it makes it the perfect weapon, just like a gun!",0,1362361541,null,0,false,0,c8p8cym,t3_19jog1,t1_c8p8cym,t1_c8p3zen,null,1431473617,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,littlewoo,null,null,"You can always pay someone to do it, but if your family is all from the British Isles, it's usually not too difficult. 

To start out with, get together all the information you can. Write down everything you know about your family tree -- names, birth/marriage/death dates and places, of your parents, their parents, their siblings, and so on up the generations. Other good information is addresses, occupations, and christenings, if applicable. Spend some time with living relatives asking them for all that stuff, too.

If you can get back that way to people who were alive before 1901, you can search the census data for them. The more information you have about the person you're searching for, the easier it will be to find them in the census, obviously. Once you find your person in one census, you'll find details for everyone else in their household. You can then start looking for the person's parents by looking for the person in older censuses until you find them in a household along with their parents. 

Once you've got names and rough addresses for a person, you can start to look on parish records and the like, for christenings, marriages, and funeral records. Between the census, and the birth/marriage/death records, you can get a pretty complete picture of the person. 

If you get stuck, your local genealogical society can probably point you in the right direction, or your local Mormon family history centre can be a good resource too. They have consultants who will cheerfully help you (free, but probably with ulterior motives) every step of the way.

We have limited housing in the UK, and housing is exceptionally expensive. It is principally unjust to take tax money away from people in poor areas who have to pay for their own housing to give it to people in rich areas who live in far better houses than those paying the taxes purely based on the fact that it would be difficult to make them move.

While your circumstance is difficult, the fact is that the state is effectively subsidising you to have a spare room which no-one uses at a point when plenty of people are trying to find houses.
