I just don't know. It's all up in the air. It seems entirely possible that we're spending to replace Bale, but it also makes sense that we're spending to keep him. 

It makes sense that personally Gareth has lots of reasons to go, but as many to stay.

We have 100m reasons to sell, but loads to keep him too.

Madrid have no reason to spend that kind of money, other than compensating for PereZidane's tiny penis' (peni?).

AVB's latest interview suggests that no deal has been struck. But he also seemed entirely deflated and hence could just be lying through his teeth.

He did say he expects to see Gareth at training tuesday, and Ancelloti doesn't seem amazingly keen on him, but that's no real hint into whether a deal is or isn't being struck.

Nothing is logical, likely, unlikely, predictable. It's all wild speculation.

His quote from what he was thinking before this match. This was right after his absolute hero Gary Speed died. 

""I was determined to play against Chelsea on the Tuesday. I had to play. I needed to do something to try to escape what had happened.

There was a minute’s applause for Speedo before the Chelsea game. I stood in the line with the rest of the Liverpool players. I felt OK. Then the Liverpool fans started singing his name. It was real to me then. That was when I started crying.

The Chelsea supporters didn’t sing his name, but I don’t expect that from them. They’re not the type of fans I’d want to play for.

‘I’m going to play fucking well tonight,’ I thought. Chelsea couldn’t get near me that night. 

It was one of the best games I have ever played. We won 2-0 and I set up both goals. Kenny Dalglish took me off 10 minutes from the end and gave me the biggest hug when I got to the touchline, which is typical of him.

Where Gylfi has been played this year is as a ""10"", playing just off the striker, centrally in our 4-2-3-1.

Basically, I think we'll be better off with only one of Dembele &amp; Paulinho, (true two-way CM types) and one of Holtby/Gylfi filling the other CM role in front of Capoue/Sandro. This will give more space for Soldado to drop off into &amp; pull the D-Line around, and give our midfielders more chances to run into the play from deeper.

The title chasing sides wouldn't want him because he's too inconsistent and ineffective most of the time, while the teams lower can't afford him as I'm sure DL would put a big price tag on him if anyone were to come in for him.

Hardly. A few religious nutters getting to troll everyone is hardly going to gain the attention of any bad government. [This is the reality of American ""Free Speech""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_speech_zone). I could go on at length about the past 100 years of US government interference and subversion of any ideologies they disagreed with. They've had numerous political purges, one every 20 years or so. Certain political ideologies e.g. socialism are practically criminal. Part of the reason the UK film industry exists is because half of Hollywood moved to the EU during the political purges. Today's spying is a continuation of long-term government policy on monitoring and controlling public opinion, all that's new is the technology. 

If you honestly believe that free speech actually exists in America in reality I suggest you read up on [the history of their legal battles in this area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater). The current precident is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio), note the wording [imminent lawless action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action). Who defines what is and what is not lawless? 

None of these legal wranglings are described in the constitution. The legal precedents override it every time. Fighting for civil rights is very worthwhile but fighting for a constitution is a political red herring.

Remember, Paulinho had enough solid chances that on a better day he might have had a brace, or even a hattrick. He was good but could never really find Soldado in front of him, making clever runs nearly all the time. The awareness of those runs is what will improve over time.

Each one of his shots, except one or two, he was in the right place to have a crack over the choice of passing. He got the distance shots on target, giving a taste of his confidence that will hopefully be translated into a bucket load of goals from outside the area, with many assists before season's end as the team's chemistry increases.

We may not have been incisive, but damn, we showed glimpses. The moment we bring Soldado into games regularly, the sooner we will begin to decimate teams.

RM doesn't need Bale they just want him so they can match the Barca move for Neymar with a sizeable purchase.
I'm convinced bale wasn't ready to move until the fee got so high it couldn't be turned down.

Hell, in the current situation you hardly have to be Kennedy or Khrushchev to play hardball in this one.  Levy has all the power and there are probably only 2 things that can force his hand Joe Lewis and Gareth Bale.

If Lewis (who for a £90m deal is going to be getting daily updates on the situation) were to say ""sell"" Levy would then have his hands tied, but i personally don't see Lewis stepping in at this point, he has never done anything but showed complete trust in Levy and how he works so it is unlikely he steps in.

Bale could say he refuses to play if he isn't sold, which could be possible....but he has smart people who i am sure are pointing out a couple things to him.  First if he refuses to play, he loses his paycheck. Second, his marketability gets flushed down the toilet.  Its one thing to be the reigning player of the year and the potential world record transfer.  Its something else completely to be the twat who pouted and refused to play.  He refuses to play and he won't be the record transfer, he refuses to play and suddenly the sponsors aren't as excited to have you represent the product. Which costs you huge sums of money both immediately and down the line.  It is still a possibility but it is literally the nuclear option and unlikely to be used.

Combine that with a stifling defense and that's a points producing machine. With Suarez, Sturridge, Stevie, and Coutinho amongst others on the field it's not unrealistic to expect 2+ goals a game from them. Of the players that went out this summer, Downing and Shelvey were the only two who scored for the club last season for a grand total of 4 goals (in the PL). I can say with confidence that Luis Alberto and Iago Aspas will combine for more than 4. 

Adding a quality CB and/or DM is definitely the way to go. Wisdom is very young and be honest, do you really trust him against the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal, and those 2 other clubs? Kelly is good, hell maybe even great, but he doesn't have a proven pedigree. That leaves us with three proven quality CBs. Should one of them pick up a lengthy injury it could get ugly. If it's Lucas the midfield will risk a complete shut down.

I don't know that anyone would consider him a world class keeper, but he's young and certainly has the potential to get there. Experience counts for a lot more than youth in a goal keeper, and he's got plenty of time to accrue more of the former. I know a lot of fans have come to expect talent rivaling any in the world from out players, but that's not always realistic.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"this isn't very good for cherry-picking a period of time, I'm sure if you took the best 20 games for a number of teams they would be comparable to this number of points.


However having said that this indicates that if Liverpool can put together a complete season without any major drops in form (which is incredibly difficult for even a title contender to pull off) then they have the quality to finish 4th or even 3rd. But like I said before there are probably several teams that could say this even the likes of Southampton or Swansea were close to this ppg for stretches of last season and Newcastle the year before


edit: Southampton only 1.56 ppg for 12 matches, Swansea 1.67 ppg over 12 matches, but Wigan 1.93 ppg over 14 matches 2 years ago to avoid relegation and Newcastle 2.06 ppg over 17 matches in the same year


Also on closer inspection 7 of Liverpool's 12 wins in this stretch were against teams either relegated or in the survival fight (5 or fewer points above 18th) additional wins came against Stoke (+6), Fulham (+7), and Norwich (+8); so in reality Liverpool were just beating up on the weak teams. This isn't new to anyone but I thought I'd provide the proper context for this


For additional context here are the best runs for the other top 6 teams:

Manchester United - 2.66 ppg over 29 games including an 18 game unbeaten run averaging 2.78 ppg

Manchester City - 2.33 ppg over 18 games

Chelsea - 2.23 ppg over 13 games

Arsenal - 2.44 ppg over 16 games 

Tottenham - 2.31 ppg over 16 games

Everton - 1.88 ppg over 17 games

Liverpool - 1.89 ppg over 19 games (2.00 ppg over 21 games including 1st 2 wins of this year)


What I find scary is that both Tottenham and Arsenal are capable of challenging for a title if those ppg totals were extented over a full season and Chelsea had a 7 game winless streak which nullified their hot start (22 of 24 points in 8 games)


Conclusion: If Liverpool perform at a level on par with last season but are more consistent they could improve their points total by 10-15 but will still lag well behind the rest of the top 6 asuming they are also similarly consistent performers",0,1377498456,null,0,false,0,cbvha7a,t3_1l2km4,t1_cbvha7a,t3_1l2km4,null,1429697459,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

My situation was a little different from /u/ChipsAndCurrySauce. 

1\. I met my British SO. Yes, we have a bona-fide relationship and have been married just under six years now.

2\. We got married IN THE USA. It's important to note this. It's easier (or at least it was then, not sure about now) to get married in the USA.

3\. We applied for a spousal visa. This is different than a fiance visa, which you cannot work on. I got it within two weeks (again times now may vary, this was in 2007). I moved to England on a spousal visa. We had to prove we were in a relationship, so we printed out 200+ e-mails, pictures, and a few other things. This first visa was around $1,300 + shipping + plane ticket (but is probably more now). I could work on this visa. 

4\. After two years passed, I had to apply for a second visa called Indefinite Leave to Remain (also known as ILR). This one was around $1,600. It's a settlement visa. 

5\. Two years after that (or was it three years haha) I applied for British Citizenship. That was about $2,000 including other fees. 

The longest to get was the settlement visa, I think that was 4-6 months. I had a friend from South Africa and hers took about a year. Another friend from Malaysia and hers took about 1.5 years. 

Keep in mind that it's hard to go between jobs within visas.

I assume you're referring to the requirement for a weapons export license to export encryption software that used keys over a certain size from the US that existed until 1999.

&gt;""oh look, here is a new encryption standard that sounds complicated"" - ""we made it"",

That's not entirely right either. The software that became DES was developed by IBM with advice from the NSA. The main problem with DES was that it was limited to a key of 56 bits. It was replaced with AES in 2001. AES was not made by the NSA.

I think it's fair to say that AES is considered broken now. 

&gt; ""look, here is the clipper chip"",

Clipper was a key escrow system that meant keys could be held by the government. That they wanted this perhaps shows that the algorithms were secure enough to cause them problems and therefore if you keep your keys secure your encrypted data should be too. 

&gt; ""look, here is the pentium bug"", ""look over here, this is the CPU ID""

I'm not sure what you're referring to here. 

You might like to read 'Crypto' by Steven Levy, it was published 2001 so it's hardly up to date but it has a good history of modern crypto.

They like to hide in temporary crevices, too, so most encounters involve moving something (a pillow, a cup, a book) and having a hairy, brown, very leggy thing shoot straight out at you like the scare moment in a horror film. Even if you *like* spiders, it's startling.

The reason for the fuss is because our country's largest, fastest spider tends to spend this time of year with the (smaller) males roving around looking for females to mate with, and the (comparatively massive but still only a few inches across) fertilised females then looking for somewhere nice and warm to rest all winter. So the average British householder, who has not seen a spider bigger than a coin all summer, is suddenly being surprised by fast spiders which are at first twice, then three times the size of anything they've seen all year.

true,socks,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"This is political-speak for:  I think I agree with and know how people feel about military intervention when there is genocide and when there is a a grand scheme to remake the world.  It's well phrased.  

What the politicians in the US and UK won't normally tell you is how much the military industrial complex is willing to bribe the political establishment for military intervention in international conflicts.  What they won't tell you is that these interventions are seen as part of a complex series of methods of funneling tax dollars into the pockets of the politicians' investments.  And they want you to think that any comments about the financial implications of military intervention is just liberal-speak for 'turn the other cheek.'  The 'conservative' is now an ironic term that actually stands for taxing and paying for political investments, whereas the conservatives want you to think that it is a term for a sensible government of the elite and the reduction of the size of government. 'Conservative' is an oligarchical corporate tax and spend business model.  

The US, and perhaps the UK, are already at war with Syria, if one has kept up with the news about the military interventions of the US, Russia (for Syria), Israel (for personal interests and with US money), UK (it seems) and others in the sovereign country.  These interventions have escalated the problem, and now the US and UK have decided to increase their support of the intervention. 

What should Cameron have said?  He should have said that he would restore and improve UK medical and social programmes and thereby improve businesses, that he would not corporatize government policies - funeling tax dollars to corporate interests, that he would work on diplomatic solutions in all cases, rather than so-called military solutions.  Notice that the military interventions by the US, UK, Israel, and Russia are further destabilizing the region (Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc).  Notice that the US spies on the UN (in the news recently), and that there have been almost no peace summits or peace talks in many years.  These were common-place in the 70's and 80s.  

TL; DR:  Cameron's intervention is the same as Blair's:  because the US and Israel want UK intervention, and because of the financial benefits of the political tax and spend engine that helps make the masters of war rich.

eh, I disagree. They overthrew a democracy but it wasn't until 1979 when their own regime got overthrown that Iran became theocratic. It was immeasurably wrong and the justification given was bunk, but the state that got installed wasn't significantly worse than the one that already existed.

my personal opinion is that if you did that, business would just rebuild back to its original state and carry on from there. Automation saves money but it cuts jobs, so any industry interested in saving money will naturally tend to cut jobs and increase unemployment. As for building business, I don't think it's as simple as setting up an office block in a field and hoping business happens in it. I think we're going to have to wake up to the fact we've made things *too* efficient in the near future, and now there are going to be people permanently unemployed.

Alright, calm down, no need to chew my arse just because I made a point of clarification that Alyxe was ambiguous about.

&gt;The problem with your first sentence is that we already have an article (see OP) where military force is being planned. Doesn't really seem like it matters what the UN observers find.

&gt;The problem with your second sentence is that it just isn't accurate. Nobody has been able to pin this on anyone, except handwaving and circumstances.

I fully expect the plans to be thrown out if it turns out the rebels did it, but if the UN inspectors say the regime did it, we'd be caught with no plan to enact. Making a plan for war isn't the same thing as going to war. You can scrap the former at a moment's notice.

true,spras1,uk,London,"It is true that not all military interventions have been 'failures', but failures for whom? In regards to Libya being handled 'relatively well' - the problem was that it denied real independence, thus undermining the thrust of the rebellion itself. One of the preconditions for arming the Libyan rebels was that they do not renegotiate the EU oil contracts made by Gadaffi. They were forced to cede their right to do as they wish with their own oil. 

Now, as I said: Syria is not Libya. The Syrian military is large, well-trained and well-equipped. There is no possibility of a repeat of Libya. This is of a different order altogether. We know full well from Iraq and Afghanistan that when the West invades it a) Goes well beyond military targets and causes huge damage to civilian infrastructure as well as directly killing civilians themselves, on a massive and terrible scale (whether this is on purpose of accidentally is not relevant,  it will not be possible to avoid it even if we allow for it not being the intent) b) Tends not to leave. The Syrians know this, since when the West intervened next door in Lebanon it took 20 years to get rid of them again.

If anyone thinks the US and Britain are going to go in to Syria for any other interests than their own they are deluding themselves. This is an attempt to make sure the Syrian uprising is directed towards ends agreeable solely with the West, with nothing to do with the self-determination of the Syrian people (and will probably take the form of a pro-Israeli puppet state). 

Now of course oppressive governments should not be able to use chemical weapons without risk. Unfortunately, the US and UK use conventional weapons on other countries without risk quite frequently. I fail to see the great distinction between the two. Chemical weapons are, perhaps, a more terrible weapon. But either way lots of innocent people are going to die and it seems to me an irrelevant distinction whether that comes at the hands of Assad or Cameron and Obama. The fact is we have no neutral arbiter to enforce (the supposed 'risk' that should accompany these things) international law (or moral precepts); the UN is not this - the powerful security council is a victors club from WW2, a group of the most powerful imperialist states who do not have the interests the worlds peoples at heart (whatever that might mean or entail).

After a year of of bitter fighting with limited support the rebels forced to take help from wherever they could get it.

It's now been two years and we have a dictator with chemical weapons who's fighting for his life, rebels that are equally vicious and so divided that they fight each other and some of whom may have chemical weapons, and then you have the vast majority of the population who sits there getting slaughtered by both sides.

If troops had gone in earlier then Russia wouldn't have had time to provide modern anti- aircraft missiles, the Syrian troops wouldn't have significant combat experience, the rebels would be much more open to Western help and the population wouldn't have suffered as much. Assad would have been forced out without any non-Syrian having to enter Damascus. 

The worry if we go in now is whether we want to conquer before passing onto a civilian government (unlikely because of lessons from Iraq), set up safe haven zone and commence a bombing campaign across Syria, or just use air power alone (possibly complicated by airspace issues, though Turkey may allow us in). 

Even with Assad gone, the rebels now have connections with less than desirable groups.

Our intervention in Libya is an example of how it can be strategically done right to limit civilian deaths. There will always been civilian deaths, but the potential cost of allowing chemical weapon usage would be far higher.

If I hear back that they won't pay my tuition fees I am appealing the decision and sending in evidence of my person am issues.

I know full well what some Brits have done in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that is not an indictment of the behavior of the army as a whole. Also, I understand how western bombing can and does lead to recruitment for terrorist groups, but that should not be taken as an argument against the entire concept of intervention. Look at the NATO strikes in Libya if you want an example that went about as well as was possible under the circumstances.

I say it is a tough issue simply because unlike in Libya, where it was rebels against a leader who was undoubtedly worse than they were (see the Lockerbie bombing if you are so concerned about terrorism), in Syria both sides are clearly breaking the rules of war. The fact that we subscribe to those rules of war, and do our best to punish our soldiers when they break them is what gives us moral authority. It is what makes us the good guys, even if political leaders were wrong in ordering the invasions. 

For that matter, what is being discussed is not a ground invasion, but selective bombing of hard materiel from naval ships. Materiel that is used to kill enemy fighters and civilians alike.

I said more ***disciplined*** defenses. Organized isn't my point.

The aim of a False-9 formation is basically to make sure defender's have trouble marking the 'striker' because he also falls deep to recieve the ball and link up play with the midfielders. The only time this works is if the defense actually falls for it and follows the 'striker' deep into midfield, opening up new gaps for the onrushing midfielders to exploit and score goals through. Re-watch the Hull City match for reference, Torres actually played a very False-9-esque game.

Now, as for why this wouldn't work against more disciplined defenses: Because they are disciplined. Simple as that. They are defenders who will not get drawn out of position half as often, simply because they know where they should be on the field at all times. Sure, they may goof up occasionally, but hanging on the hopes of that goof-up happening is the same as hoping it happens while playing a standard formation with a true striker.

That being said, the fact that Syria has a well-trained military is actually an *advantage* for the US and UK. Our militaries are still cold war forces, built from the ground up to take on a standing military. Look at the Iraqi conflict as an example. Coalition forces took the nation in a few days; the Iraqi army simply crumbled under superior American and British land forces and aircraft.

I don't think there will be much of a military problem when we intervene. Even from a humanitarian standpoint, bringing the constant state of war to a final close would probably save more lives than it may cost and finally give Syria a chance to rebuild.

That being said, if we're *arming* rebels, we're literally funneling weapons into the hands of Al Qaeda and other Islamic fundamentalists. A rebel victory means an Islamic government and, by extension, is *very* bad news for the religious and ethnic minorities of Syria.

Honestly, I have no idea what the best move is here. It seems like a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't problem.

true,spras1,uk,London,"&gt; I think it may have worked early on in the conflict

I'm not sure why someone who is not necessarily pro-intervention would have even wanted to intervene early on. Early on the driving force was a popular revolutionary movement that held high hopes for democratisation of Syria. All early intervention would have done is derail this, twist it towards purely Western ends and create a puppet state (precisely what has happened everywhere else the West has intervened). So it would have created a lose-lose situation from the point of view of the Syrian people

&gt;That being said, the fact that Syria has a well-trained military is actually an advantage for the US and UK.

It is not an advantage compared to Libya where it was possible to do most of the attacking from the air with *relatively* minimal military commitments. The point is Syria is a whole different kettle of fish. It's military will not simply be crushed with a few bombs from places. We are talking about substantial, medium to long term military commitments on the ground. It is also the fact - whether anyone likes it or not - that clearly not the entire country is behind the rebels. We are talking about intervening in to a civil war situation. This will not be over quickly, and it will not be over without large casualties. What we're talking about here is a possible full scale invasion and occupation of some sort. An Iraq, not a Libya (and the reason they've held back for so long on this is because they know this full well!). Yes, in Iraq the military crumbled in a few days (not so likely in Syria I would add, but even if it was my point will stand) but a civil war ensued for years. Now, I'm not in the business of stacking one set of bodies against another in order to determine the best course of action. However, what proponents of intervention will have to get to grips with is that Syrians will be swapping Assad's gas for Cameron and Obama's bombs. A lot of Syrian civilians are going to die. At the same time any hope for a democratic Syria with full rights of self-determination will be placed permanently off the table ('permanently' as in for any foreseeable future). Everything that people have died for so far will be lost. 

&gt;That being said, if we're arming rebels, we're literally funneling weapons into the hands of Al Qaeda and other Islamic fundamentalists. A rebel victory means an Islamic government and, by extension, is very bad news for the religious and ethnic minorities of Syria.

There is a possibility of oversimplifying the situation. It is questionable whether these forces are dominant in the rebellion, or even how large they are. Certainly larger now than they were, since the popular components has been largely crushed now. 

I don't know what the best move is either. What I do now is that a very bad move is to invite imperial powers in to Syria. They will make things worse, not better.

If we weren't going in the US wouldn't. It doesn't want another Iraq and, like Libya, it wants others to take a leading role alongside the US to temper it's reputation as a warmonger. The US is always put in an awkward position in these situations. The Syrian people are being systematically slaughtered. The only country realistically that can stop them is either an enthusiastic pan-European army or the US. Given the first is hugely unlikely the US with support from others is the only hope we have of stopping genocide from happening (depending on how you would define it, it's already happening). You can't criticise the US et al for not intervening in Bosnia and Darfur then tell the US it's a threat to world peace when it suggests intervening in this situation. Either you are in favour of intervening in situations like this or you have to accept that you are willing to let Assad do whatever he likes to the people who have been unfortunately born into the country he's taken over. 

The MOD has a budget for a reason - for this reason. Bringing the other useless things this government has done is irrelevant.

Wilfred Owen

Dulce Et Decorum Est

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of disappointed shells that dropped behind.

GAS! Gas! Quick, boys!-- An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And floundering like a man in fire or lime.--
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.

If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,--
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.

true,spras1,uk,London,"&gt;You appear to be under the impression that I'm supporting another foreign led government change as in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm not, never have done

This is the net result, whether you support it or not. As I pointed out with Libya, even though US/Britain did not lead the charge in regime change (restricting themselves to a supporting role, probably not possible in Syria) even this came at a price for Libyans.

&gt;but there's already a civil war and a humanitarian disaster happening.

Which is going to be exacerbated, not solved, by Western intervention

&gt;Libya? Of course there were still civilian deaths, but the number was drastically less than what could have been had we gone in on the ground.

I've pointed out several times that a Libya is not possible in Syria. This will most likely involve ground invasion of some sort, or at least extremely heavy bombardments which cannot be restricted to military targets.

&gt;What does it matter how much blood is on our hands? 

Because it tell us that the US and Britain are not forces for global 'good'. They do not act to save lives. This is why I find it baffling that they are continually resorted to as a force that is supposed to do exactly this, when the evidence is the opposite. It's not a case of blaming 'everything' on US/Britain but of apportioning blame where blame is due. Yes, right now they aren't responsible for Assad (Russia can have that one, at least in part). But if they intervene, they will very much be responsible for the ensuing chaos and should rightly be blamed for that. (Although I should add that both the US and Britain are, over the long-term, hugely responsible for the present state of the ME)

&gt;These weapons have limited usage in war other than to kill as many as possible (where manpower isn't an issue) and instil fear of annihilation.

I'm not in favour of chemical weapons, quite obviously. But, once more, you're talking about two countries with some of the largest nuclear stockpiles in existence; implacable supporters of the rogue state of Israel, also a nuclear power, who has recently used white phosphorous, is involved in ethnic cleansing etc. As for 'fear of annihilation' the tactic of 'shock and awe' has been a pillar of Western military strategy, which is precisely to deploy the fear of annihilation and cause submission in the face of overwhelming force. This is what Western intervention will look like. We're talking about exchanging one fear of annihilation for another fear of annihilation, that's why I say the distinction ends up becoming a bit elementary. Death by gas or death by bombs? That's the choice being given to Syrians.

I'm not talking about anyone washing their hands. But not washing our hands means right now forcefully pointing out that US and Britain are going to make things worse for Syria, not better. The reason I say this is not from a position of 'not my problem'. It's because I do care.

The only intervention I would've been tentatively in favour of was arming the rebels *without conditions*. Of course, the West will never do that.",0,1377530217,null,0,1377530566,0,cbvmubz,t3_1l3rg1,t1_cbvmubz,t1_cbvmpwj,null,1429694785,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* Over the course of an infinite period events with frequencies greater than zero occur an infinite number of times. That's to say if a dictatorship in Iraq only caused one wrongful death each year then over the course of eternity it would result in an infinite number of deaths. Of course this is rhetoric, but I do wish to stress the point, how many deaths due to inaction would it take to justify action? Do the figures we're trying to balance have to look purely at death counts, can it not factor in what were the continuing human rights issues that would have had a similar cost though not as immediate (political prisoners/maimed torture victims/disappearances?)

* It's very likely that were Hussein to die of natural causes while still in power that the entire country would fall in to civil war. Either adding a huge cost in civilian lives, or a similar military cost for the west in NATO peacekeeping forces while we struggle to establish a democracy in an extremely unstable political climate.

* If you're going to argue against Iraq, argue against it's cost. However, such stories are rarely unbiased. A lot of the troops involved in our occupation were from our standing forces.

true,kopking08,null,null,"The internet brings together all manner of fans. So any arsehat can be a LFC fan just the same as they can be a Chelski fan or Man Shitty fan or a ManUre fan.

We're all mixed in a pot. So even if we all support the same club, it doesn't make us all the same type of fans.

What I've noticed more than anything else these past two windows is that there are a lot of fans who have no financial sense and would rather have us emulate the Man City's of the world than the Dortmunds. They aren't invested in the ethos in the club, they're just pissing themselves for us to get CL - as if that'll even be enough the first season we achieve it. 

Perhaps its been too long since we all were there, but last time I checked being in the CL isn't a trophy and it isn't a title. Its money and prestige. But only such that you can continue to push on. 

Without consolidating our gains and knowing what team we are, they'd have us piss money away on the next Youtube Legend they think will be the clubs savior. The higher the markup, the better they assume the player will be. They haven't learned from the club and their competitors transfer failings. They haven't learned it isn't a value for money market. They just want to FEEL like we're moving ahead, never mind that outlaying money unwisely could cause us to stagnate or regress.

Honestly, I think of everyone who shit themselves over Sigurdsson and Dempsey. If we'd signed either of those lads our last summer would be as much of a joke as the one we signed Downing, Hendo, and Adam. 

Instead we were wise, we waited, we even suffered a bit for it. But in the end we got our men and are primed for the future with stars at two of the most important positions. 

In-fighting might not solve anything, but there are fans who know football and there are fans who should just go and support City. 

Loving the club doesn't mean accepting its failures unequivocally, as much as it doesn't mean only feeling good about the club if they're shelling out transfer fees over 25 million pounds.

There's a balance between criticism and support, between tough love and love. But too often the internet, being the great equalizer it is, puts fans who don't get the difference right next to those who do. And so there's some tension there. But thats the case not just for Liverpool fans. There isn't a club I see on broader Premier League forums and boards that doesn't have a tension between Mickey Mouse fans and the real fans.

Nearly every smart fan feels a need to say they're sorry about all the dumbass fans who support their club. So its a reality of the internet.

But I look forward to the end of the season when Willian has done some amazing tricks but had no end product, to ask my fellow fans: really? You really thought this lad was going to get us to 4th?

 You could argue that without out it our country does not stay as wealthy but I can't see how much of the profit obtained from the Iraq invasion will ever reach me directly.

Eden Hazard comes in second for me, the two time French player of the year was exactly what we wanted when we went for him. He hit the ground running in the prem and will only get better.

Thirdly, it's Oscar. Now, this was hard for me as somewhere inside of me says he is our second best, he plays phenomenally well in most of his games. He is on average our highest travelling player in the 90 mins we play. All this from the guy ""Too small for the prem""

Fourth, I'm gonna say Kevin De Bruyne. We done the right thing in keeping him at Genk and bringing him back when he was favourable for first team football. Very good for his age and I hope he keeps up the form from Pre-Season.

Fifth for me.. Schurrle. A good acquisition for Chelsea. Has the ability to run it in or hold the ball up, many a good trophies coming his way.

Last I'll go with Moses. If this was a post about our whole team, he'd be around about here anyway, never seemed to like what he does, he's lightning quick yet doesn't have the confidence to run in behind defenders, nor play a decent cross in.

In the top 20 scorers United had 2 (1 in top ten and 1 in next 10), City had 3 (but none in the top 10), Chelsea had 2 (arguably as Ba came midway in the season and Lampard takes their penalties), Arsenal had 2 (both in next 10), Tottenham had 2 (one in top and one in next), and Liverpool had 2.

Borini is not our next expected goalscorer after Suarez and Sturridge. It'd be Aspas.

Whereas le Fondre, being his clubs top scorer, had to at least be expected to score the second most goals.

Basically, point is, Borini scoring 5-8 is exactly a fine contribution for him. The best clubs distribute the goals widely amongst their players and we actually have enough attacking talent and creators to see that happen. If we were a club that played a 4-4-2 I might agree with you, but we get goals all over the park because of fluid movement of our 4 attackers.

Property is inherently a limited commodity, restricted by the size of our island and still further by green belt laws and planning permission. 

It is totally meaningless to talk of housing in terms of ""the free market"" because the government inherently meddles in the cost of housing.

They do so by printing money and setting the Bank of England's lending rate and in tenancy protection laws (which make property investment more or less profitable for landlords).

&gt;Or Britain (and I presume you've Israel in your sights here) sneak in, totally avoiding detection by enemy forces and launch a multi point chemical attack, with all the logistical problems that come with such a thing, and then disappear without a trace?

Where did I suggest that? I said they'll end up helping the rebels when they attack Assad, those rebels who in my opinion are most likely to have used chemical weapons.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"It was a dark and stormy night.

Our young heroine was returning alone from school to the family home. Her sole objective was to reach the television as quickly as possible to get her fill before her strict mother returned home, as the standard daily question would always be ‘have you finished all your homework and tidied your room?’ before any TV privileges were allowed. Of course she had not, but she knew that if she got her viewing in quickly enough, she’d have a good hour or two alone with the children’s TV of the day before the evil mother returned home, felt the back of the still-warm TV set, and either slapped her on the back of the legs or removed a privilege such as sitting in the garden until dark drawing and looking for the family of hedgehogs who lived there, or spending a few hours out on the BMX with friends until her 9pm to bed curfew. What was the pointing in doing things the wrong way round? After all, boring adult TV started at 6pm, so it was important to break the rules as watching the news and boring documentaries were not where the fun was at.

So it was a dark but possibly not stormy winter’s afternoon, the house was parallel to a thick row of very tall trees separating it from a busy A road, so it really was a gloomy and eerie feeling when she entered, unusually, through the front entrance. 

At this point it’s probably appropriate to mention that our heroine had recently been allowed to watch terrifying films by an irresponsible sister who resented being forced to watch child-friendly programmes when babysitting and instead watched whatever she preferred, films such as Nightmare on Elm Street and Child’s Play. Even though our heroine was frightened and would often half-hide behind a pillow, she could not bear the humiliation of admitting to the group of cool kids who wore lipstick, had boyfriends and went to discos and suchlike that it was really, really scaring her, so she would put on a brave face so that she wouldn’t seem uncool to the ‘grown-up’ teenagers, and refuse to leave the room and face the possible humiliation of being called a child.

So our heroine does what you’d now expect of such a lazy, disobedient child and closes the front door, discards her schoolbag on the floor of the porch, and without so much as even reaching for a light switch paces across the living room toward the television set. You could never tell what lengths the evil mother would go to in order to uncover the child’s disobedience, she probably had neighbours spying on her, so we can imagine the child probably intended to sit in the dark with the curtains drawn to give the impression that nobody was home.  After all, she often spent hours in detention for something or other after school, so this was perfectly feasible. 

She was mid-pace across the living room when, out of the corner of her eye, something appeared to move. That something surely could not have been one of the family cats (Bilbo and Baggins), because it appeared to be at least at shoulder height, which would be feasible if a cat had jumped onto the mantelpiece, but not in the *centre of the room*. Now we can only guess what was going through our heroine’s mind at this point in time, but I think it’s reasonable to assume that she thought Freddy had come to get her, as her sister had almost certainly told her he would on many occasions. I believe her reaction was a reasonable one, one that we see in the animal kingdom all the time as a defence mechanism to imminent threat: her bones turned to jelly and she crumpled into a heap on the floor, giving a pathetic ‘aaahhhhhhhhhh’ whimper as she went down, it has since been since learned, in slow motion. 

How long she was unconscious for only the history books can tell us, but what she woke to will never be forgotten. It was to a baffling shriek of an adult male; this confused our heroine because it wasn’t the terrifying attack sort of shriek she’d expect from a horrifying man with knives as fingers who was going to rip her to shreds in her own home whilst she stood defenceless, without so much as having watched a single episode of Hartbeat or Byker Grove, but that of a man who was laughing so hard that it came out as an unnaturally high piercing sound until it settled down into a more human sounding set of uncontrollable belly laughs, sniggers and snorts.  

The lights came on and the man, who had risen from a nap on the sofa, revealed himself to be the child’s stepfather; she had been well and truly caught in the act, his face was streaming with tears of laughter and he was holding his side in pain, as he was unable to control his laughter and therefore had given himself a stitch. 

The utter, utter bastard.

I may be use the term heroine lightly, but bastard, not so much, as he’s still fond of recounting this story to this day.

Not witness-free clearly, but the one that sticks in my mind the most, other than the usual stupid things that I do on a daily basis such as burning breasts due to ironing dresses whilst wearing them, etc. There are far too many of those to begin to recount the best.

I've decided I'm going to do all 11 doctors (and the 12 when we know what he looks like. But I also want 12 enemies. I have been printing them out and iterating the designs somewhat as well.

The picture isn't in any particular order. In fact I scrambled them up a bit. You can make a bit of a game out of guessing which ones are which and then checking to see if you were right.

The key is: (Left to right, top to bottom)

* Two
* Dalek
* One
* Nine
* Ice Warrior
* Sontarin
* TARDIS
* Zygon
* Eight
* Five
* Uh... I forget
* Six
* Cyberman
* Four
* Ood
* Three
* Seven

Seven has his question mark umbrella that you can't see in that view. I gave Six an open umbrella because without the colors in his costumer I didn't think there was much to distinguish him. Any pointers to improve any of them would be welcome.

I want 12 monsters so coming soon is:

* Ten
* Eleven
* The Master (classic beard)
* Silurian
* Weeping Angel
* K1 Robot

I might be wiling to swap out K1 if anyone can recomend something better. K1 was only in one episode, but I loved his look and the episode was cheese-tastic.

So far this has been a great project. I've been learning a ton. Each piece only takes about an hour to do, so their not a big deal each, but en total the project is massive. But I'm really enjoying it.

Oh, and the game rules are coming together in my head, but I'm still up for suggestions.

I think the general feeling at PSG is that he didn't really live up to his price tag, but that's what happens when you're played out of position. I feel like his game time will be limited somewhat this season as well, as a result of both Lavezzi and Lucas being in front of him and terms of wide players, and their system containing 2 strikers since Cavani arrived, so there is no chance of him playing his preferred no.10 role. They also have a roughly €100m expenditure so far with only €6-7m in return sales, so may want to offload a player with a high value who would be unhappy on the bench.

But don't even try and act like our Government hasn't got a hand in this, we've been destabilising and meddling behind the scenes in the middle east for decades.

With your use of the prefix ""upper-"" you might be trying to make a distinction, placing him into a sub-category, but you really shouldn't. 

Cameron is amongst the nation's richest 1% and although he may not be in the top tier of that category, he's far enough into it to justify things like offshore trust funds (which many other members of the 1% don't employ).

Whilst I agree there are elements of ""breeding"" and ""heritage"" to being ""upper-class"", with the widening of suffrage, actual aristocratic titles have become redundant in the last century or so. Decisions are no longer made by peers in the House of Lords, and ""anyone"" can buy themselves an effective political lobby group - anyone in the actual (de facto) aristocracy, that is.

My own view is that catholics will be in the majority quite soon BUT most of them are perfectly happy with NI staying in the UK. The republic can not afford us (the british government subsidise us to the tune of 9 billion a year), there will be no united ireland anytime soon. 

The big issue for the future will be education and jobs.

Catholics are now in the majority at Queens and UU, and there are more catholics at school age.

In the future a lot of professions that are currently majority protestant will switch to being majority catholic (law, medicine, civil service etc) due to force of numbers. At the next election Belfast with be a majority nationalist city and SF will likely take the first minister post. 

Combine this with the fact that a lot of protestants students go to Scotland and England to study and many do not come back (the sensible ones you might say), you have a real brain drain of leadership in the protestant community. 

The flag protesters are going to be even more irate when they realise the taigs are taking over. 

If maybe tempting for some nationalist to get some satisfaction out of these stats, but really it does society no good to have an extremely troublesome minority flaring up every few months, it is killing our tourism industry.

Normally I would be quite a positive chap. I like living in NI, like most people I just want to get on with my life in peace. If we had complete stability we could have near full employment, for example our tourist industry is 1/10 of the size of the republics. 

There is no leadership in the loyalist communities, middle class protestants have abandoned them (and largely abandoned politics) we just have a mob lumbering from one incident to the next. I see the flags as a symptom, the real issue is education, lack of employment, a perception that they are 'losing their culture' - it may be all bollix but they believe it. 

The sensible amongst us will say that these sectarian headcounts are a really bad idea, we should be aiming to boost the prospects of everyone in our society, but sense seems to go out the window here.

The future does not look good, these 'protests' are going to rumble on for years. To me they are the number one issue in NI but our so called leaders do bugger all to try and find a solution. 

I know it is easy to laugh at these protesters, a lot of it is really farcical, but we need to find some way to engage with them to try and resolve these issues. The alternative is a cycle of unrest that will only get worse.

David Moyes has proved time and time again that he knows how to run a football team.

Willian has a lot of ability and very well may be head and shoulders better now than Downing ever will be/or was.  *But we don't know yet*.

They are middle-class but I would say they are most likely lower-middle or middle-middle. 

&gt; I honestly don't think it's meaningful to talk about someone who went to Eton and who, due to hereditary wealth, has never needed to do a single day's work in his life, in the same category as them.

He isn't in the same category and, as you point out, being upper-middle is a huge leap from middle-middle. Not the same category at all.

&gt; Cameron is amongst the nation's richest 1% and although he may not be in the top tier of that category, he's far enough into it to justify things like offshore trust funds (which many other members of the 1% don't employ).

True, but wealth isn't the prime factor in determining class. Someone could inherit vast wealth and still not be upper class. For example, Romeo Beckham will most likely inherit millions when his parents die. He won't be upper class though. Likewise, the Duke of Westminster could lose everything and be penniless (unlikely, I know) and he would still  be upper class.

&gt; All that aside, Cameron can trace his ancestry to the King of England, so you're really just picking straws about his great granddad being a bastard.

true,sneakyi,lfcflame,,"Just because some supporters have different opinions on various aspects of the club to you or this article does not mean their opinion is less valid if put across in a well constructed manner.

A problem I would have with this article is the assumption that we should be content that both our manager and captain think the current team needs 2-3 first team players to compete in a real way for 4th place, and the club isn't backing them in the transfer market. 

There is value in the stabilisation of the club but the owners could definitely do a little more to support the manager.

The argument is often polarised into 2 camps, the reality lies in the middle ground, as is often the case.

FSG have a good idea of how to stabilise a club and increase revenue streams.  

They did put debt of 50million they used to buy the club on to the club. They said they would never do this. The club debt has risen to 100million now.

They have put their faith in a young manager. They got burnt by Comolli in the transfer market but he was their choice.

BR has built a decent squad on very little money in relative terms. FSG have spent 45 million net on the playing squad since they bought the club.

This is hardly massive investment in relative terms.

The manager wants some quality added to the first team and the owners seem unwilling to bend from their new transfer methods which means we are not very competitive in the transfer market. 

Spending on a scale comparative to Man City etc is totally unreasonable.

That doesn't mean the owner's shouldn't push to get certain high value players which the manager sees as perfect for his team.

The manager sees as perfect, nevermind what internet bloggers and fans think, the opinion that matters on playing staff should be the managers. 

As I say, look between the lines of the 2 arguments if you want to garner a reasonable opinion of the situation. 

The polarising of the argument is just tribal dick waving.

The first direct regular savings account pays 6% on the balance, however

so it's actually paying 3%. It also only lasts a year, then reverts to a 'normal' low interest savings account.

""Ulster"" at least as originally conceived died when the old stormont dissolved, and was arguably doomed from the start. The new 'power sharing' Northern Ireland will probably last a good bit longer, at least as long as the (soon to be) new catholic majority don't have a compelling reason to want to begin the transition. 

Heck, even if NI joins the republic, it'll probably be a separate 'home rule' state for a good generation or two. Sinn Fein probably don't want to lose the 'power', and the political establishment in the republic would rather keep them as well as whatever is left of the unionists at arms length. So I can't see 'Northern Ireland' vanishing any time soon.

But the key thing is we no longer have a large majority who would say no simply due to 'loyality to the crown' or a fear of 'rome rule' or whatever reason no matter what the benefits may be. 

If there is an overall benefit to being in the republic, we're soon to be at the stage where most people would at least listen and perhaps vote that way out of self interest. (In the same way a lot of Catholics at the moment would vote to remain in the UK for the time being, not out of a lack of desire for eventual unity, because it might mean higher taxes and a financial hit in the short term).

There are plenty of upcoming disruptions where events may just turn out such that we find ourselves thinking we might be better off under the wing of the Republic. UK leaves the EU and cuts NI off from all that European Aid? Scotland leaves the UK and England isn't in the mood to pay for our cushy civil service jobs any more? Investors and companies keep creating jobs in the republic but never NI thanks to a better tax regime and more stable link to EU markets?

Its ridiculous how many dumb fans have entered the game, who would rather pay a shit ton on some foreign youtube sensation who's not proved shit in a top league. 

Moses has proven himself to be dangerous IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE. Same as Sturridge had. He just isn't given a chance because Chelsea are run by a guy and manager who have no interest in developing talent. 

Honestly, all these young English lads are given the worst advice signing for these teams. How good could Adam Johnson or Jack Rodwell or the endless English talent have been if they'd just been smart and gone to a club that would actually give them game time and a chance to rise to the top.

What does Moses add to our front line that we lack?

Pace, power, and directness. He is EXACTLY the type of tactical addition we need. He can score goals. He can assist. Anyone who watched the Villa game will have noticed we had trouble stretching their backline because no one has that pace. With Moses in the first 11 Gerrard could get some joy from long balls and Coutinho and Aspas could occupy the space to be found when Moses stretches the back. 

Not to mention he's young and value for money. 


I'm not ignorant to the fact we'll eventually need to sign a couple world class players to lock down 4th. But I think many fans are wrong to assume we couldn't get 4th just by improving incrementally and adding hungry players. 

Last January, how many would have thought we'd be discussing Sturridge and Coutinho as world class players? I don't think Moses will get to that level, but surely he's better value and more proven than Willian.

With an improved finished and the usurping of Arsenal or Tottenham in the table this fall (and the overall season) we can be in a better position to sign top talent in January or next summer.

You weren't suggesting this but I've read a lot about it'd be better to just play Sterling. I think he'll get game time no matter what. But what fans have to remember is even though he came on strong at 17, most players don't fully mature until 20. So he'll likely be roughly the same type of player the next 1-2 seasons.

So their goal has been to help rebels. However has time goes by the rebels and become more and more jihadi. Two years ago they were talking about ""freedom"" and  ""democracy"". Now all they talk about is Sharia and massacring anyone not from their branch of Islam.

In the mean time the Syrian went from losing battle to battle to stabalising it's frontline to taking back areas. The UK, US, Turkey and the Gulf countries have already tried several schemes to help the rebels. From giving them billions of dollars, giving them weapons and helping them co-ordinate attacks. All of this hasn't really worked.

The area where the attack happened is in Eastern Damascus. 5 months ago Croatian weapons given to rebels trained by the Americans were running around the area taking out tank after tank. However in the past few months they got stopped, trapped, had their supply line cut and have been facing their area of control being chipped away slowly. In essence they were going to lose and lose badly. This attack happened conventially when the Army was beating these rebels.

This in my opinion is a last ditched effort by the UK and the US to change the state of affairs in Syria. Their guys are losing and they want to attack the Syrian Army and weaken it. That way they can help the rebels win.

true,kid_boogaloo,null,null,"&gt; I'm also not sure if he fits in Roberto Martinez's long-term plan either and the Blues boss deployed him in a deep midfield role against West Brom, which negated him.

&gt;Fellaini is best when he is marauding forward from midfield, unsettling defences, and scoring goals.

This is why journalists who don't watch Everton week-in week-out shouldn't be commenting.  

Despite a short spell at the beginning of last season, Fellaini has shown that his best position is holding midfield.  He played their the entirety of 11/12, and for the second half of last season and was exceptional. 

Yesterday for instance, he completely negated West Brom's attack,  all they could muster was weak attacks down the wing because the centre of the pitch was a fortress.  He also had ample opportunities to break forward and got involved outside of our opponents box. 

Under Martinez we seem to be hoofing it forward much less, which was the only reason Fellaini was really good up front.  I would much rather have him win headers in midfield to restart our attacks than have him knock down speculative balls in the opposition half just for the centre backs to clear.  

20 mil would be fair if he wants to leave, but I deride the assumption that he must surely want to leave just because he plays for Everton.

It says it all that I've heard almost no Evertonians say that Fellaini's best position is up front, yet I consistently hear it from casual fans and commentators.

For most degrees, including PPE, it is finals only, with material covering the previous 2+ years of study. You sit a set of prelims at the end of first year. Thereafter you will do a 1-3 papers every single term, and will sit an exam on each one of those papers at the very end of third year.

For instance, I may do a paper in the first term of second year called ""20th Century British Political History"", or ""Aesthethics"". At the end of 3rd year I will have to sit a specific exam written for that particular paper. 

There may be a thesis involved somewhere, but for PPE these are optional, and will count for no more than 1/6th of the degree (possibly less, I can't recall how many papers PPEists actually do).

For History, my subject, it does get up to a quarter on coursework (via one thesis and one extended essay) However, that is fairly recent, and was the result of the research-led emphasis the subject has.

Personally I would rather have had more exams, simply because it is incredibly rewarding for bright but lazy people, who write quickly like me. It basically condensed the entire degree into a couple of weeks hard work just before the exams. 

It was totally unrepresentative of anything other than my ability to cunningly plan exams.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"&gt; But we don't know yet.

This is the approach I take with transfers or potentials transfer, I try be a bit more laid back as in ""look we got a player, what he did before might have been great/bad, but he's with us now and it's what he does for us that matters now"". I try not get excited about potential signings until the player has signed with us and I can see what he brings to the team when on the pitch. I didn't get excited about Mkhitaryan, Costa or Willian (I might have got a bit excited by Papadopoulos though) because what I've seen of them has been very limited to the Champions League for Micky and Willy and a couple La Liga matches for Costa. I watched a video or two of each on youtube but I could make a highlight reel of myself playing 5 a side looking like Messi and I'm by no means a good footballer, I don't pretend to know loads about a flavour of the month player after watching these videos because they only tell half the story. I can be shown all the positive stats and whatnot but I'd rather wait and see what happens on the pitch after they sign for us, football isn't played on paper. Rodgers has mostly impressed me with his signings so far so I trust his judgement when he identifies a player, I didn't have that in Kenny or Hodgson, Rafa was more of a mixed bag however.

&gt;just can't even consider that they may not be 100% correct about something that it's not even possible to be 100% correct about

I think it's important to be open minded regarding other peoples opinions, myself and kopking08 had a debate the other night in relation to the owners backing Rodgers over Willian, we both had our points about the situation and kopking had some good ones that made me sort of reevaluate what I thought of the situation the day after (I'm still disappointed by it though :P).

I have my beliefs about certain things at the club but not all are absolute, I am open to having my mind changed on things if people present their points and reasoning behind them, if they can get me thinking then it's not a bad thing. I'm not the best debater to be honest, but I don't see it as a way to tell people that what I think is right, rather I see it as an opportunity to learn or open my mind, more than anything.

Debating through presenting points and backing them up is healthy, resorting to personal insults and whatever is not.",0,1377542306,null,0,false,0,cbvr218,t3_1l4837,t1_cbvr218,t1_cbvps06,null,1429692819,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The game is at a complete stalemate after halftime. At this time it is 1-1.  Goals from Rvp and Lukaku (subbed in).

RVP then suffers a slight injury that takes him out for two games at which point he is replaced by Rooney. At the 89 minute Chelsea fail to score from a set piece and the ball lands on Rooney's feet. He has a completely blank expression on his face and smacks the ball into the back of the net. United's net.

To see it in purely left / right terms is therefore rather misleading - it points the way to how the USA might have developed as a more egalitarian society. Note how the film uses Despotism as the reverse of democracy, not communism, which is the term that might have been used if the film had been made ten years later.
At the time arguably Britain was - in the terms of this film - pretty well heading down the despotism route, with information, power and land ownership in the hands of The Few (The BBC, centralised government, and the old land owning gentry).
Whereas the 1960s &amp; 70s saw much of this British 'despotism' being undone, the last ten years in Britain feels like a reversal, with information being controlled (try getting an objective view of the Syrian situation), power (virtually all politics is right of centre)' and ownership (by faceless offshore corporations) now tilting us a long way back on the 1946 scale.
What we are experiencing currently is a huge shift in the respect scale. This is not to say that British society has always been accepting of 'the outsider', but we are now being coerced into victimising the disabled, the immigrant, and the 'different' among us.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Ah I enjoy this one... *""The Royal Family are German""* fallacy. 

The Royal family are no more ""German"" than they are ""English"". The thing with European royalty is that they are a minority group who bred selectively for upwards of a thousand years... e.g. German princesses married British Kings, French Kings married Dutch princesses and so on -- as that was part of how diplomacy worked in that era. Although occasionally newcomers like the offspring of wealthy tradesmen may have entered into the group, for the most part they remained an aristocratic elite. In that respect, they are not unlike the european Jews, who also bred selectively. Hence why although they lived across europe, they identified primarily as Jewish and retained a distinquishing set of physical characteristics. So the term *""blue blooded""* is not entirely wrong, in many ways royalty (and at one point almost all aristocracy) are effectively their own distinctive group, that transcended the borders that defined the rest of us. So you can call the Queen English, German, even Russian... but in reality what they are is ""noble"". The Queen certainly doesn't identify as German, nor does Prince Philip identify as Greek. Nor can either speak the languages of those nations (though the Queen can speak French quite fluently - ironically one of the european nations to which her recent genetic connection is actually fairly weak).

To give you an example using your own example - while Prince Philip was a Greek/Danish prince, he is also the oldest surviving relative of Queen Victoria (a *""half english/half german""* woman who famously married a *""German""* Prince) and is by extension even related to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia... 

**tl:dr** - the royal family have more in common (in terms of ancestry) with other european ""nobility"" than they do with ""The English"" or ""The Germans"" as an ethnic group. The notion they are Greek or German is entirely false, and infact British monarchy haven't ever identified as German - though Prince Albert and Queen Victoria probably spoke at least some German privately, their descendants almost certainly didn't given the events of 1914-18.

Torchwood was created by Queen Elizabeth **specifically** to combat the Doctor, as well as similar threats to the British Empire. It comes up quite a bit more in the Torchwood show that they are against the Doctor. While if you haven't seen all of that series and weren't paying attention you might think, ""Torchwood?! But that's run by Jack Harness who is a companion of the Doctors!"". While this is true, in the Torchwood episode ""Fragments"" we learn that Harkness was captured and tortured by Torchwood, in attempts to flush out the Doctor so as to destroy him. Jack, knowing the Doctor may be the only one in existence to ""fix"" his condition of never being able to die, figures he must wait around at Cardiff (for over 100 years) to ever catch up with the Doctor again. What better way for a man who can't die to spend his time than to work for Torchwood, who are actively seeking him out? Jack may be the Doctors friend, but Torchwood certainly is not.

Personally, it isn't really even as important if you don't approach with an open mind--that is ideal, of course.  But approaching a topic, even one you feel strongly about, with the understanding that it is not a factual debate and there will never be a proven right or wrong opinion is important.  I don't know how many times I've gotten into back and forths with people on Reddit about opinions where they insist that I am simply wrong, and that I'm stupid for thinking a certain way.  It's an opinion--there is no definitive proof.

I think there are a ton of really good posters on the sub, though, and these problems are nothing new to the internet, supporters, or people in general.  Absolutism is a plague of discourse and I think that the media climate these days does not reflect the correct attitude.  So often in punditry--news, culture, etc. and sport--the person who is most brash or makes the boldest claims gets heard the most. Why it's popular to be loud and the most severe in your statements--positive or negative--is beyond me.  Moderate views are often the most accurate, so why reward someone who can't see both sides of an issue?

Just because the rebels are in disarray, it does not then follow that Assad is not a madman.  How can you expect that rebels in such disarray could have launched such a logistically complex operation as a chemical weapon attack?  It was Assad.  And his use of them makes him a madman.

You seem desperate to use any number of increasingly wild theories as to why it would be the rebels who are in 'disarray' who mounted a gas attack, and not the man in power who a) has chemical WMD and b) stated he would use them.

&gt;You clearly don't know anything about this conflict and are not understanding what I'm saying yet you're getting all the upvotes. It's fucking insane.

I have a very good understanding.  Just because I have reached a different conclusion to your own, it does not then follow that I do not understand.  I feel you are wrong in your conclusions, however I don't doubt you've read lots to do with the situation.  The problem, I feel, is that you have formed a conclusion and are desperately seeking validation in wild hypothesis.  You'd be better served to look at the situation without any preconceptions.

Finally, you are being downvoted because you place a man, Cameron, as being worse than someone who is gassing people to death.

Example:

A large housing estate is being built in Taunton. At the same time, building work in town has reduced car parking spaces and there is no plan to build any other car parks elsewhere. The town council has made their opinion clear: they see people taking the Park &amp; Ride in.

Okay, I can understand that. Except that it's too far to walk to the Park &amp; Ride from this new housing estate - and you'd have to cross a number of very busy roads. It is necessary to drive, and in driving you go straight past an out-of-town shopping centre that boasts:

 - Sainsbury's
 - Halfords
 - Mothercare
 - Bensons for Beds
 - Currys
 - Staples
 - PC World
 - Homebase
 - B&amp;Q 
 - A cinema
 - A bowling alley
 - Pizza hut
 - A pub
 - An Italian restaurant
 - McDonalds
 - Ample free parking

He's tested the West before. During March, 30 died in Khan Assal, just west of Aleppo, from a suspected chemical attack.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"A neighbour kicked our door down at 5 or 6am one morning and put a gun to the bf's head, and after a large amount of gibbering managed to proclaim that my bf had stolen 12k in dole cheques from him. 

...because of course having 12k in dole cheques as a single man in your 20s is *perfectly* normal. 

We were both stark naked and had only gone to bed an hour or two beforehand as it was his birthday and our local had a very late lock-in. 

After what seemed like forever and an awful lot of screaming in his face on my part, I managed to wrestle his gun-arm down from the bf's head and slowly moved him out of the flat by continually pushing him against the chest until moved back a step at a time, whereupon he promptly went downstairs to his gf (who had been screaming up the stairs at him the whole time) and toddled off to bed. 

Turned out he was a petty criminal, known to the police and off his head on drugs. I can only assume the money amounted to 12k because he'd been stealing other people's dole cheques.

He later apologised to us via the police and said 'I know it wasn't your fella, it was a black man.' He'd managed to get CCTV footage from the dole office over the weekend (we'd bolted to my parents) before making this apology, claiming he'd seen the man who'd been cashing his cheques. Oh: the police kept us both in for 12 hours the next day, getting me to describe in painstaking detail the layout of the flats so they could send an armed squad in to arrest him. Then they called me on Monday and they said 'oh, in the end we decided to just see if he'd hand himself in over the weekend and he did.' Nice. 

As an additional bonus, we shared the same landlady, and as he was the son of a friend of hers, she refused to kick him out, so we had to leave instead.

- Did not agree with the false nine. If you're going to play a false nine it means you have to dominate the midfield, and we didn't even do that.

- Schurrle and Terry for me were our best performers. 

- Hazard may need a break. He looked flat and out of ideas. Hopefully Willian can fill that gap. 

- Lukaku needs to play

- Defensively very solid. United could only get a clear shot from 24+ yards out. All day for Petr Cech.

- Ramires needs to work on his passing. Seriously. 

- Overall not a bad result. A point at Old Trafford is always welcome, we just have to make sure we get maximum points when they come to the bridge

The thing is, even though there were the massive waves of immigration I talked about, there has been a consistent trickle of Irish immigrants. One side of my family came over during the civil war in the 1920s and one of my parents came over in the 1970s/1980s 

 A lot of them were doing itinerant, or part time Labour and sending the money home (rather like the Polish community today), so the links and cultural exchange to Ireland were still relatively strong ( stronger anyway than the parts of the diaspora that were on the other side of the world in America and Australia where they developed a more distinct Irish-American and Irish-Australian culture).


Family is lot more important to that community I would say (maybe due to the nature of the diaspora, maybe due to the emphasis on the family unit in Catholicism), they often stuck together. They'd meet the Anglicised, settled Irish immigrants at the local Catholic church and Catholic schools and pick up the local culture and bring it back with them. And these settled Mancunian-Irish would obviously support United because the link with Catholicism was a lot stronger. However, very few people pick their clubs based on religion any more, unless they're absolute scrotes - one of my parents is Irish Catholic and choose to support city because of the pretty blue kit and Colin Bell.

Many Irish people still support United because their parents do and their parents did because of the links to the family that came back to Ireland I presume, and brought some Manc culture with them.

Edit: Also, to address why you never see Irish Liverpool fans any more - it's because Liverpool are currently shite ;), the Manchester clubs attract glory hunters because we are shit-hot at the moment.

**[""Tripoli is braced for armed confrontation and threat of a coup as rebels mobilise across the country and blockade key oil ports""](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/libya-rebels-muslim-brotherhood-blockade?iframe=true&amp;width=100%&amp;height=100%)**


Libya today is on the verge of a second civil war, as groups in Cyrenaica and Fezzan agitate to secede from the Muslim Brotherhood government in Tripoli. The central government is weak, and clashes between armed groups stocked with heavy weapons still occur in Tripoli. Little success has been made in disarming the hundreds or thousands of armed groups throughout the country, despite attempts to integrate them into the fledgling army and police force. 

Oil exports have plunged 70%, with instability, political conflict and infrastructure damage inhibiting the recovery of the country's oil industry and overall economy. The Libyan government's control over oil production is so tenuous that they have had to [threaten army action](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/15/us-libya-oil-idUSBRE97E10Z20130815?iframe=true&amp;width=100%&amp;height=100%) against local groups attempting to sell oil independently.

Further, there have been profound consequences for the region. Muammar Gaddafi's weapon stockpiles have been thoroughly looted, and proliferated throughout the region - including Mali, where Gaddafi's Tuareg mercenaries helped instigate the collapse of the central government and the rise of Islamist secessionists. Libyan revolutionaries and heavy weapons, including missiles and MANPADs, have been smuggled into Syria to fight the government, further fuelling a wave of sectarian conflict throughout the middle east.

This is off the top of my head. /u/G_Morgan is correct in asserting that Western intervention did the job it was supposed to do - it overthrew Muammar Gadaffi and averted his plans to sell oil in currencies other than the U.S.D. However, the assertion that ""nothing"" went wrong in Libya after Western intervention is far from the truth. 

Finally, the instability and chaos throughout Libya in the aftermath of Western intervention has made Western powers [wary of intervening in Syria](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Chaos-caused-by-Libyan-war-delaying-intervention-in-Syria-313803) for fear of similar consequences.",0,1377551591,null,0,false,0,cbvuehs,t3_1l3rg1,t1_cbvuehs,t1_cbvi7ij,null,1429691237,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I've lived in Winton, currently live kind of between Winton and Charminster. You'll have to look up property websites for the price of professional living rather than student living because we don't pay council tax and you will if you're not here for the university side of things. 

The areas are nice, but quite studenty. Southbourne is pretty nice but quite far away from the town centre. Apparently Boscombe is rough but I don't spend that much time there to really see that. I don't know Poole at all, so I couldn't tell you much about that. 

Cheapest food - there's an Aldi in Wallisdown and Boscombe, there's a lidl in Winton. There's also an Asda at bournemouth train station. As a student I find these places to be the cheapest but other people might have better ideas. 

Home utilities - Wilkinsons in Winton are really good for cheap yet quality furnishings. There's also quite a lot of Charity shops like British Heart Foundation and Sue Ryder care, where you might be able to find cheap second hand furniture. 

Best internet I have is with Plusnet. 120gb a month and very speedy. They do a totally unlimited for like, £40 a month or something. Unfortunately internet is included in my rent cost so I couldn't tell you what the price is. Again, I suggest doing some googling and checking out reviews for the best plan. My experience with Virgin media is awful, I really wouldn't go with them if you end up in Winton. 

Cultural info? Uuum don't queue jump? Please and thankyous are always appreciated? Don't tell young children that Father Christmas doesn't exist? I'm kidding with you, I really don't know. Have good manners I guess. 

Cars - They're expensive. I don't drive and that's the reason why. Obviously drive on the left, keep your tax disc up to date. Remember to have an MOT once a year. Not allowed to drive without insurance or a valid MOT. Google these terms if you don't quite understand :)

Places to live - I suggest googling some ""frequently asked questions"" that you should ask when viewing a property. I.E. Do you have a gas safety certificate? How do you turn on the heating/hot water (sounds silly but so many people don't ask and then don't know how to do it with their system). Has this house had damp before? Etc. etc.

You can be a model or an actor, but your parent would have to sign every contract for you. You are not allowed to do nude modeling or be in porn because of the risk of exploitation of children if this *was* allowed. At 16 you're still pretty much a child, having sex is one thing, having sex on camera, for money and all the rights belonging to a third party is something else entirely. 

Viewing pornography is entirely different, firstly it is not illegal to watch porn if you're under 18, the same as its not illegal to drink if you're under 18. Its only illegal to sell porn (or alcohol) to someone who is under 18. This law is also widely regarded as pretty stupid, if the lib dems had got into power it was one of the things they were going to change. The only reason it hasn't changed is because no one is fighting to change it, no one really cares.

Moses is a proven Premier League quality player, definitely of Europa League quality. He has had 2-3 years of PL experience and is still only 22. He would've had the best coaching available to him at Chelsea, learning from and training with players like Hazard, Oscar and Mata can only do good.

People used to this know that you can turn off slightly before the queues start and it'll take 10 minutes to get to the sea front instead. This points to awful traffic management rather than the roads being filed to capacity. The greens solution? More cycle lanes (this traffic comes from out of town, locals use the less busy roads so this does nothing), £4 an hour parking and useless 20mph limits that can't even be enforced because the enforcement equiptment isn't accurate at that speed.

Going down the promenade you're presented with peeling paint, ugly traffic calming measures, grubby fish and chips, death trap stair cases (thankfully closed off now).

a TL:DR from the article itself:
&gt; Unionism has a short window of opportunity, before these kids grow up and vote it into oblivion, to come to an honourable settlement with their fellow Irishmen and women – but there is no indication yet that that reality has yet sunk into the consciousness of the leaders of unionism. 

The thing is, alot will also depend on the Nationalists.   If they want, once they have a majority, SF could start actually attacking the ""culture"" the sectarian-protestants are so worried about.   Some of it (eg. banning the hanging of sectarian OO/terrorist flags) I'd applaud.    Some things (banning certain parades etc.) could cause the fleg brigades to go ape-shit.   I can forsee a situation where we return to the troubles of the past, but with roles reversed.

We have a short window where we must share power, and I believe it is now that our politicians must act to preserve our peace for the future.

I personally believe almost all of our politicians are incompetent bigoted fucktards.

You could perhaps argue that not all of these players are up to snuff, but a good amount of them had success at decent-sized clubs in top 5 leagues and fizzled due to moving to a club that wanted them for squad players, not starters.  Unfortunately it is symptomatic of football. The top clubs want top reserves and that isn't good for the careers of footballers who need starting player minutes to continue to develop.

Looked like the game plan was to control the game which to Utd standards, we did. They had low shots on goal and none of their strikers got a clear cut chance. Most of the game they were cornered in the sense that attack came from the right via Valencia/Young.


We fielded our fastest players: Hazard, Ramires, Schurrle, Oscar, KdB in hopes of a quick counter but lacked that little bit of passing accuracy and Mata to conduct the attack centrally. That said, if we played Mata, centrally we could've been exposed. Oscar did a great job tracking back, as did Ramires.

That's weird, because you absolutely cannot do that now (and I can't find any evidence of it having changed recently), legally your parents would have had to sign the mortgage agreement, and place the property in a trust for you for when you turned 18. You both cannot apply for a mortgage or any form of loan if you are under 18 and you cannot own any land even if you buy it outright if you are under 18.

Something must have changed, but I'm not sure it has...  

Also you're downplaying the role that your parents (or another trustworthy adult) would have if you are arrested, 

&gt;If you’re under 17 or a vulnerable adult, the police must try to contact your parent, guardian or carer.

&gt;They must also find an ‘appropriate adult’ to come to the station to help you and be present during questioning and searching. An appropriate adult can be:

Not all of our politicans are incompetent fucktards. Some know *exactly* what they are doing, and they aren't doing it for the good of us all, or even necessarily the communities they represent, it's for their narrower agendas.

In one of those surveys they do every year they discovered that since the flag riots kicked off the whole Irish/British national identity question had become more polarised, i.e. less northern irish, more british and more irish responses. While not a proper census level survey it did get me thinking that some elements are likely counting on this polarisation happening both now and in the future for their own political gains. And we've seen how easy it is to provoke certain groups.

Either way, there really is only one way to combat this and thats to really push on the middle ground, and shift as much support as possible to the moderates (NI21, Alliance, SDLP). Because whatever the future holds, it really should be negotiated, discussed, and as detached from 'street politics' as possible. Sadly, after the last year I wonder if the damage is already done and we're just going to have to put up with a certain level of pointless violence every time someone doesn't get their way.

true,DaveMcElfatrick,,Coleraine,"I like to think that the homogenisation of Northern Ireland (something completely viable, considering the Protestant brain drain and the eventual clear Catholic majority) will bring consensus of what Northern Ireland actually IS. Northern Ireland, right now, has no strong, unified sense of identity- rather it is a clashing plurality of colours and creeds, which doesn't do much for tourism when both 'tribes' are bickering over the identity of Northern Ireland. However, I firmly believe we'll see consensus with a clear Catholic majority, and with that less conflict in the long run. Of course, loyalism will go down kicking and screaming like a rat trapped in a corner, but that will eventually die down.


Derry's an excellent microcosm of the scenario. A largely Catholic city with a vibrant, unified sense of Irish culture, tinged with a minority Protestant/Orange culture that has no qualms with the consensus; the Royal Black Institution having no sense of fear in being able to practice what they see as their culture without any threat. We saw that at the fleadh, when loyalists bands happily took part in an Irish music festival. This will eventually happen all over Northern Ireland. Loyalism, as we know it now, will eventually be consumed by the consensus and it will have nothing left to fight for. When they feel like the land is no longer 'theirs', they will quieten down. Perhaps then, the hate demonstrations we see today in many loyalist areas will take a backseat to the colour and pagentry of the marching season. This is when it will become a tourist boon.


Northern Ireland will slowly be rebranded as a part of Ireland that is also part of the UK. The protestant community will perhaps embrace their Irish heritage once again, while Catholics will feel comfortable in being an Irish part of the United Kingdom. *If* the timing is right, and the republic can support the north, then eventually Irish unification may happen, but that's a while off yet.",0,1377558251,null,0,1377583689,0,cbvwogs,t3_1l4k1l,t1_cbvwogs,t1_cbvpik4,null,1429690103,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

For one, Further Maths is a big step up from Maths. When you just take Maths (at least on my course), you take Core Maths (with two exams) then a module exam (Mechanics, Statistics or Decision).

I'm not raising any cause for alarm, but the fact is, they were very sloppy at times and physically outmatched, especially in the first half.  I've been saying that our biggest weakness is inexperience and it showed today.  Our front four of KDB, Oscar, Hazard, and Schurrle are all under 22.  Hazard wasn't playing particularly well in the first half, although he was better once Torres came on.  Schurrle was almost invisible when he was up top, KDB wasn't very effective, and Oscar was probably are best attacking player and he still didn't get more then a couple of weak shots.  Even if we intended to defend and counter, we were failing.

Once Torres came on and our top four organized themselves in a more conventional manner, we had some decent control in their half.  The game opened up much more and it was a little more back and forth.

true,Legitfront,null,null,"The start of the season at a new club is always the same, making them believe. These ""kids"" just played in the Champion's home ground and walked away with a point, a pleasant experience and one they will remeber next time.

Mourinho builds teams, he makes them believe they are invincible at home and undefeatable at their rivals home ground.

That takes work, it means that your players can't lose away games at rivals and have to win at home. Thats why Mou always plays it safe at the start with a new team and will play with a 3 man defense (or less) at home if he is losing. 

What if Chelsea played for the win and lost? Would it help their confidence knowing they risked it but lost? The league is a marathon and knowing that if the champions can't beat them what chance do the other teams have of doing that?
Chelsea will now ""know"" that when they step on a pitch the game is theirs to lose. That confidence is the mark of Mourinhos teams and that of champions.",0,1377566059,null,0,false,0,cbvz8tz,t3_1l58jz,t1_cbvz8tz,t3_1l58jz,null,1429688906,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

We have social standards in real life and if a gooner walked up to you in the street you wouldn't abuse him.

They defaulted on a large (GBP68m?) loan at the beginning of this year, which was taken out in the first place to cover the player salaries they weren't able to pay.

Last financial year they had a 40m euro shortfall which had to be recouped through player sales - this season is likely to be even worse as they have no extra non-transfer fee money coming in than before and they missed CL qualification for the first time in three seasons which means GBP20m+ off the top of their revenue.

I've heard some speculation that the debt problems are so large that there's almost no point in them selling players as it won't make enough of a difference. However it seems Bankia and the board are willing to pressure the chairman to sell (as per the Soldado transfer) and bring in cheaper replacements.

I'm not sure why you think you're smart, yet you won't even attempt to argue your viewpoint.  I didn't say Downing was better or that his body of work was necessarily better, but he has a *larger* body of work to prove *his value*.  Downing isn't a £35 million player, but I think there was as much, if not more, evidence that Downing was a £20 million player as there is that Willian is worth 35.  

Downing, in 405 appearances in the EPL has scored 40 goals and has 69 assists.  Willian has scored 40 and has 68 assists in 254 appearances, with the vast majority of those appearances being in the Brazilian, Ukrainian and Russian Leagues.  His CL/EL performances are decent as well, 10 goals and 14 assists in 56 appearances, but he had rather pedestrian years until last season when he scored 4 and assisted 4 times in the CL. Willian's numbers are better, no doubt, but he's not proven a whole lot on a large stage, and they aren't the numbers of a £35 million winger who is supposed to add attacking genius to a side.

Also, I wish I could find Downing's historical chance creation numbers, as those were supposed to be among the EPL's leaders during his time at Villa.

I'm not saying Downing is better, has head a better career or will ever have a season better than Willian, simply that Willian is not Maradona or Zidane as so many seemed to think.  He is a young player who is still raw and has still never played a sustained season in a league with top players.  The whole point of my post is that Willian is no more a lock to perform with Chelsea than Downing was with Liverpool, yet you seem to have attempted, and failed, to claim I am saying he is better.",0,1377571615,null,0,false,0,cbw15m4,t3_1l4837,t1_cbw15m4,t1_cbw09fb,null,1429688015,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It's not part of their remuneration for NHS services.  GPs aren't obliged to fill in paperwork for their patients unless it's something like declaring someone medically unfit for jury service.

Also, it's not just ""a note"" - it requires pulling the patient's case file and can take a decent amount of time to complete properly, particularly if the patient has a complex history or you don't know them very well because they never come to their appointments.  Most GPs are self-employed and time spent filling in paperwork is time spent not seeing patients and bringing in money for the practice, which of course costs a lot of money to run.  

Like many things doctors are asked to sign, such a document is officially certified by the doctor as being true, based on that doctor's probity and good standing within the profession.  Furthermore, a condition for eligibility to remain on the medical register is that you only sign what you know to be true, so you can understand why a doctor would need to check his or her facts carefully.

Similarly, if a person appeals an ATOS decision, any costs involved in investigating the appeal, including those incurred by GPs and the NHS providing evidence, should be paid by ATOS. It is unfair to expect the patient, the doctor or the state to meet the cost of ATOS' failures.

Currently as far as I can tell there are no negative consequences to ATOS for incorrectly ruling that a disabled person is fit to work.

Also, a winger has to be evaluated on goals and assists, for me.  That's his main job.  What would you say is their job otherwise?  Tracking back?  Making space for others with their movement?  Maybe those other duties are also their job, but they sure as shit aren't worth £35 million--which was another of my main points.

Also, I love how you say what amounts to, ""Willian is really good, 4 srs, lots of managers wanted him.""  Hooray, I guess?  Lots of manager didn't sign him is the truth.

And again, please show me one world class winger who doesn't score or assist others who score.  Maybe someone like Claude Makelele didn't score or assist, and perhaps Xabi Alonso or Andrea Pirlo don't fill the stat sheet, but they aren't wingers.  Willian is a winger--it's his job to score and assist.  He is a forward.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think the issue is that we are really looking for a combo player, and both Pastore and Banega are almost combo players but not quite.

Look at Willian and Bernard aside from being Brazilian they could both play left wing and CAM which for what we want to do (or seems we want to do i should say) that is perfect, means when we set up in a 4-2-3-1 they can slot behind the striker and in the 4-3-3 they can move out to the wing and still be a creator.  Problem is there just aren't many of those available now.

Banega is a deep lying CM and he does that well, I think he could slide up into a no.10 slot but i don't think he has...well the intangibles to be really effective there. But could pace the team from deep (provided he doesn't do something stupid off the field).

Pastore is a true no.10 who hasn't seemed comfortable out on the wing and while i think he could move back i think the same thing goes for him as Banega...he is just missing that...something that would allow him to be good in the deeper role.  But he could be that dynamic disruptive influence behind Soldado.

Neither are my first choice but i wouldn't be upset if we ended up with either.

Pjanic (as utterly impossible as it seems to be at the moment) to me is a complete want as a player, he isn't someone that you would move up the pitch but he is Modric-like sitting deep and could be a complete maestro for the pace of the attack.

Eriksen is interesting to me because i think he could move deeper (though i think it would be a waste of some of his abilities) but could excel at the no.10 when linked up with any of the Dembele/Paulinho/Sandro/Capoue.

true,captainlavender,smith,Smith,"Some unscary episodes (I am NOT vouching for their quality, only their relatively non-creepiness):

The End of the World

Aliens of London/World War III

The Long Game

Bad Wolf/ The Parting of the Ways

The Christmas Invasion

Tooth and Claw (warning: werewolf)

School Reunion

Love and Monsters

Army of Ghosts/Doomsday (sort of)

Smith and Jones

The Shakespeare Code

Gridlock, though that's a bit more subjective

Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks

The Lazarus Experiment

Partners in Crime

The Fires of Pompeii

The Sontaran Strategem/ The poison Sky

The Doctor's Daughter

The Unicorn and the Wasp

The Stolen Earth

Journey's End

Planet of the Dead

Victory of the Daleks

Vampires of Venice

Vincent and the Doctor

The Pandorica Opens/ The Big Bang

A Christmas Carol (this seems like an episode kids would enjoy)

The Curse of the Black Spot

Let's Kill Hitler

The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe (another standalone)

 and I can't speak to series 7 since I only saw it once and have forgotten much of it.



**To particularly avoid** (at least, according to my personal scariness standards):

The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances

The Girl in the Fireplace

Rise of the Cybermen/ The Age of Steel

The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit

42

Human Nature/ Family of Blood

Blink (dear god, Blink)

Utopia/The Sound of Drums/ Last of the Timelords

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead

Midnight

The Waters of Mars

The Time of Angels/ Flesh and Stone (depending)

Amy's Choice

The Lodger (big time)

The Doctor's Wife

The Rebel Flesh/ the Almost People (not so much for adults, but kids might get upset)

The God Complex



**Some episodes are just very sad**, and those you might want to avoid also, or read up first and then decide:

Father's Day

The Girl in the Fireplace (again)

Army of Ghosts/Doomsday

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (also again)

Turn Left

Journey's End

Amy's Choice (also also again)

Vincent and the Doctor

The Impossible Astronaut (well, the beginning)

The Doctor's Wife (a moose once bit my sister)

The Girl Who Waited


I have to reiterate the warnings, though. Many of New Whos' finest episodes are on either the scary list or the sad list, and the ones on both are uniformly superb. Of course, if the kids can't see them now, they can always watch them when they're a bit older.
