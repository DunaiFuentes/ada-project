true,TheMountebank,null,null,"It doesn't seem confusing at all to me. 

Births are generally not spontaneous - they're planned, although sometimes the plans do go awry. People don't generally just order a midwife as if they were ordering a pizza, they will have spoken with medical professionals for a long time up to the birth itself. 

Most women who enter labour are capable of getting to hospital without NHS assistance - generally via taxi or someone else driving them in. A large number do call up for an ambulance out of panic/inability to get in otherwise/poor advice etc, so it's not a rare event. Chances are it's a 30 minute job for the ambulance to drop her off at the hospital. It's not a great use of the ambulance crew's time, but considering how often they ferry drunk people to a&amp;e, it's not the worst. 

If the woman requests a midwife to attend her at home when she starts giving birth and it's not a planned home birth, then chances are a home birth is not a good idea. The home won't have been checked for suitability, the midwife is walking into an unknown situation and that's going to be detrimental to the health of the mother and baby. 

If a woman requests medical assistance at the time of her birth, and those offering it decide the best route is to get the woman into hospital (likely by ambulance if the woman is unable/unwilling to use any other method) then I think it's on the woman if she doesn't want to attend. Dictating your own medical care is fine up to a point, but you can't expect everyone to be at your beck &amp; call just because you don't agree with the medical advice. 

If the home birth is planned, this changes of course. But I still don't think someone has a ""right"" to that, it's something that needs to be assessed and decided by those it is being asked of.

Instead, it was seized upon by colonial powers, whose repression tarnished the beneficial ideas that they had transmitted in the Ottoman era. After that, came the Cold War, and the cynical powerplaying of the USA and USSR (both as bad as each other despite Russian rhetoric against imperialism and US rhetoric for freedom) was basically the death blow - once more, the chance for self determination was missed.

Yeah, something like that. See http://www.just-eat.co.uk/ for some examples. If you're on Gilbert Road, it's probably kinder to your heart to grab a pre-heated meal/pastry from the Co-op on Histon Road. It would have to be a pretty poor kitchen not to have a microwave and/or oven and that's all you need to grab frozen ready meals from the Iceland on Histon Road, too. They'll be £1&amp;ndash;£2.

&gt; Are there are any car share programs near the University?

The University is delocalised throughout Cambridge. If you're expecting a walled off campus, or even a single area you can point to, you may be disappointed. That being said, zipcar.com operates a micro-hire business throughout Cambridge.

&gt; Is renting a car the only way out?

You can bus (cheap, long, uncomfortable, inflexible) or train (expensive, long, uncomfortable, inflexible).

&gt; I did see one Top Gear challenge where the guys bought sub-100 pound cars. Are these still possible? :)

The car, yes. Road Tax, MOT and insurance, no. Insurance will be especially expensive if you don't have a UK licence. (I think, based on people's moans in the lab.) And the likelihood of getting a £100 car through an MOT is small. You may note that Top Gear generally buys cars for under a hundred pounds but _drives_ them in countries with less stringent traffic laws.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"It's possible (stress on *possible* since none of us know the full details) that the cyclist was to the left of the car (perhaps even in a cycle/bus lane or just near the curb), so if the car stopped suddenly he would not hit the back. The car suddenly moved left without indicating or checking mirrors and the cyclist was not far enough back to avoid this unexpected manoeuvre.

It is a bit like if you were on a two lane road, in the left lane, and near the back of another car which is on the right lane. You're very close behind him, but you're on the left, so it's fine. If he were to suddenly move into your lane without indicating or checking it was clear, then you'd be in trouble.

Obviously this is worse for cyclists because they are more vulnerable, harder to see and many drivers on the left lane will forget to check their left side for cyclists/motorcyclists when turning left or pulling over. It's just a matter of not being used to the possibility of a small cyclists on your left even though you're in the left lane.

This is a common occurrence and many people die every year when a big truck and an unfortunate cyclist meet under these circumstance.

It's not the case that either party is fully at fault. Drivers should try to be wary of cyclists passing on their left but they might miss them if the cyclist is going fast or in their blind spot. Cyclists should be cautious around large vehicles especially approaching junctions and should be aware that any altercation is more likely to hurt the cyclist than the driver.

In this case, it's impossible for us to know if the cyclist was too close to the car for safety or if the driver was the one who pulled over into the cyclist's path suddenly. That's up to the courts/insurance companies to figure out.

One thing is for sure though. The driver is a fucking asshole for laughing in the injured cyclist's face and driving off.

Your suggestion that cyclists just ride around blindly without taking safety very seriously is rather mean spirited. Most of us are very aware of our mortality on the bicycle and we do our best to stay safe without a giant metal cage to protect us. I hope that when you drive, you will maintain a proper level of caution for the more vulnerable road users, even when they are not following the rules like they should.

The real constraint on government spending is the economy's capacity to absorb it before raising prices. That is, if it were to allow labour to become scarce through spending too much, inflation would be the result.

That is the real constraint, and one that Osborne has left the UK woefully below, leaving millions out of work - billions of potential infrastructure/welfare improving man-hours of labour forever lost to us, now in the past - all for concern over the imagined financial constraint of the UK government running out of pounds.

Walking around the floating harbour is really nice, and there's a couple of really nice places to stop along the way.  

Start at M Shed, as someone else mentioned, then there's Brunel's Buttery for an awesome bacon sandwich, then the SS Great Britain.  Go on past there and you have the Cottage Inn (pretty reasonable), the Nova Scotia (not sure) and the Pumphouse (expensive but really nice) for a drink.  

Come back towards the city centre and you have the Grain Barge, owned by Bristol Beer Factory, a pub on a boat with a great view from the upper deck.  Stumble your way out of there and it's a nice walk back towards the Harbourside where there's a ton of big, noisy chainy type places to eat and drink (there's some good places there really).  

Then just across the footbridge there's the YHA hostel, which is in a great location if you want to party.  Definitely looks like the kind of hostel I would want to stay in if I wasn't too old and grumpy for sleeping inn a dorm and didn't live 15 minutes walk away.  They might even have private rooms?  Other hostels are Rock and Bowl near Broadmead and 007 Backpackers in Bedminster (a bit of a walk).

That's my suggestion, although there are a ton of cool places around Stokes Croft and Gloucester Road area.  This gives you a different view of Clifton and the suspension bridge from below.

Oh, and make sure you go to St Nicholas Market, it's nice just to wander around and smell all the different foods there.  Even as a committed meat eater, I have to say the falafel there is amazing.

That might explain why, in The Five Doctors, it is the 1st Doctor (the youngest, least experienced) who comes across as the wise/smart one - the others are simply playing along because they remember that's how it happened (sort of like parents humouring a child).

Plus, in The Five Doctors most of them are kept apart until near the end, so they would still have to get through those bits without forewarning, and they wouldn't know exactly when the events were going to happen.

At least, that's my way of retconning bad writing from people who assumed that older == wiser, rather than noting that the younger-looking Doctors were actually older.

This idea makes battling an earlier Doctor particularly interesting (if the Hurt-Doctor is a pre-9 one); the later, ""good"", Doctors may remember all the evil things he will do and will be able to stop him from doing them, but they can't, because doing so would create a paradox. They would know how to defeat him in the end, but would have to let him carry out all his evil plans first. Plenty of opportunities for more angsty-Ten, and frustrated-Eleven.

Also what happens when one of these trains in the tube breaks down? How do you get people out? Flood the entire system with air effectively shutting it down, and then cut a large section out around the train? So each time a train breaks down you'll lose the whole system for hours or days, and shut a large chunk down for even longer while you reconstruct it.

And before you reply with ""just make the trains bigger!"" well as soon as you do that the whole system needs to get far far bigger, bigger pumps, bigger tubes, and you lose a lot of speed too.

Yes I have worked zero-hours contracts previously but my personal experiences are irrelevant when talking about the *concept* of a zero-hours contract and the *potential* risks associated with them.

Well no they actually aren't weasel phrases at all, because I'm committed to a number of facts at the general level. Zero hours contacts guarantee you zero hours. That's a fact. The number of hours vary. That's a fact. The nature of flexible contracts means that you have to use flexible statements to accurately reflect their reality.

&gt; As a young adult you need to work two days to earn what you would through JSA.

That's absolutely true but it overlooks two key problems:

 1. Zero hours contracts guarantee you no income
 2. There are more considerations regarding unemployment than you have personally experienced.

**From [this link](http://www.alrakoba.net/articles-action-show-id-31201.htm):**

&gt;Al Bandar returned to the spot light with an open letter directed at the secretary of the Sudanese Communist Party, Muhammad Mukhtar al Khateeb on the 20th of February which gradually spread throughout the media outlets.  The letter accused members of the Sudanese Communist Party in London with collaborating in activities of preaching atheism with support from Jews, according to the letter.  The writer used the evidence of the support of the party for the apostate Nahla and helping her with atheist activities and other undercover  secret sabotage activities aimed at overthrowing the Sudanese government.


**From [this link](http://www.alrakoba.net/news-action-show-id-91264.htm) which is an interview with one of the leaders of the Sudanese Communist Party:**

-The media has recently been flooded with accusations against the Communist Party for converting the girl Nahla to Christianity, what have you to say about that?

&gt;We are not a religious party, we're a political party and our position towards all religions and beliefs are equal.  The positive behaviour of people is that they should not offend any personal belief but to respect it.  In our party we have Muslims and Christians and some belong to Sufi groups and every creed within the Sudanese community.  Thus we have no position towards converting people towards Islam or Christianity because that's not the concern or the objectives of the party.

-But the letter that was sent by Dr. Salah Bandar was a warning about the behaviour of some of the members of the Communist Party and their behaviour in London.

&gt;I was out of the country when the letter was published but I doubt the objectives of any party is to spread Christianity.  

-Dr. Salah wasn't talking about the party in general, but about the specific incident in London [that of Nahla].

&gt;I think this issue has been fuzzy from the beginning.  There are people who have enimosity to the Community party and they try to make up stories.

-Who do you mean?

&gt;Those who oppose us historically.

-But the letter came from someone within the party (there is an assumption that Salah Bander is a member of the Communist party).

&gt;Salah Bandar is not a member of the party and does not align with us politically.  And I speak generally and say that whoever has animosity to the Communist Party has to find something more structured to attack us with because the party has nothing to do with religion.

They are not treated very well. I have seen staff come in to work, only to be told they are not needed, go home. So not only did they not earn anything that day, they have spent money to find out they wont be getting paid today.

No say on shifts, at all. The threat of reduced or no hours is used to control them. Every day I see staff told to stay until 1am (normal finishing time is 10pm for them). There is no public transport at 1am, taxis cost time and a half. 

Don't like it? Refuse to do it on the grounds that you don't fancy a two hour walk in the wee hours? Oh well, no more hours for you.

They purposely keep far more staff on the books than are needed, purely to keep them easily replaceable. There is also no sick pay, no holiday pay, and there pension is shockingly bad compared to mine.

However, within our judicial system in order to find someone guilty of rape the prosecution needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act was committed. When the accusation effectively boils down to one persons word against the other, then the person in question cannot be found guilty. This does not mean that the person in question has made up the allegations, it means they cannot be substanciated to the level whereby it is enough to justify the state taking away that persons liberty.

Yes, we need to change how seriously the police takes rape, but that does not justify continuing to ruin the lives of people the court has not found enough evidence to convict.

true,steveok,null,null,"In my few months of experience, the pubs in Cambridge provide either a good eating environment or a drinking experience - they're rarely good for both. I prefer the drinking type, so I'd recommend:  

**The Elm Tree** for a large Belgium beer selection, solid ales on tap, and a very nice atmosphere. It's clear that the people who own the place are legit lovers of drink; though it gets plenty of tourists in the summer, I've always expected to walk in and see people playing a pen and paper RPG. The best part: its outdoor seating is in a pleasant alley that is perfectly aligned to catch the sun until very late evening. Great place to drink.

**The Free Press** just down the street from the Elm Tree and has a nice garden as well as a quiet atmosphere. People say it's among the best little pubs in Cambridge.

**The Devonshire Arms** is another good, quiet pub. Was only here once but I've heard it mentioned as one of the better places to drink.

**The Cambridge Blue** has a huge outdoor seating area, plenty of room indoors, and a long line of taps. Their beer selection is very broad as well.

A quick note, however: with the exception of the Cambridge Blue, there may be better places to go to meet people. These are mostly my favorite places to drink alone (sob).

Everything is expensive here. Make your own meals, use Gumtree or second-hand shops for everything that you don't absolutely have to buy new, and hold out for deals if you can.

true,hemm1,null,null,"I'd like to see some numbers; how many peoples lives are *actually* 'ruined' by lack of anonymity? What does that even mean? Do other countries have anonymity systems, and what are their relative rates of the relevant statistics?

This topic is massively dominated by emotive thought, and declarations that particular policies 'obviously' do or do not work. For instance, multiple people in this thread have already declared that the advantage of encouraging other victims to come forward is negligible, but it isn't remotely obvious to me that it's true. On the flip side, the reason for the policy is a general fear of false rape accusations, but how common are these and how often do they reach any given stage? 

Other than that, how would anonymity even work? Is a rape victim not allowed to tell *anyone* who raped them until the conclusion of a court case weeks or months later? That seems unfeasible, the information will clearly come out, so then how is its dissemination limited? How does the potentially innocent accusee avoid the reputation damage this policy would be intended to avoid?

Ultimately, this kind of thing seems to me like a knee-jerk reaction to a fear that I'm not convinced is statistically justified. I mean, it might be very reasonable and a good idea, but I'll believe it on the basis of statistical evidence rather than hype surrounding a small number of highly publicised cases.

I've told this story here before, but I have a French DJ friend who was accused of rape in 1998 and got fucking hell for it. It's a long story, but the gist is the girl had been lying all the time and it was merely a case of her boyfriend finding out that she'd got off with him one drug fueled night and her making shit up as an excuse to get her out of trouble. 

The boyfriend dragged her down the police station and from that point on the lies just got deeper. 

Once the press ( and I will add that this was just local press ) got hold of it he lost his flat, his work, his reputation, he got a kicking, the lot. It turned into a damn witch hunt and all because he was presumed guilty from the off. 

And to be honest, I started believing it too. 

It was only when it went to trial and she broke down (before the trial) that the truth came out. 

So yes, I believe they should get anonymity.

true,brettvirmalo,crest,KONE|2015,"I wouldn't disagree with any of that (disclaimer: it is ""working"" but not yet effective).

I have not dissected the numbers, but I don't think the increased possession has resulted in a proportionate increase in chances created. 

Also, a slower buildup allows more defenders to get behind the ball, closing space for players like Coleman and Mirallas who benefit from space and one on one situations. This slow attack is a huge factor when playing lower-table opposition, because this will be their game plan anyway (11 behind the ball and counter attack).

The Pienaar-Baines combination has not looked as good as last season thus far, as they seem less inclined to push forward quickly all on their own to take advantage of space and numerical advantages. I think the possession game is why Baines is off pace to match his amazing chances created numbers from last season (he should be ahead, considering the opposition thus far). 

Not against the approach (actually quite excited to see it blossom), but it is yet to pay real dividends in my mind. I think it is unrealistic to believe that a new manager can have any new system up and running smoothly in one preseason and four real games. 

The strikers are the easy target to blame (though they obviously deserve their share), as their failings are the easiest to spot.

The FA would much rather just ban the use of the word 'Yid' than have to explore the nuances of why it's acceptable for Spurs fans to use the word 'Yid' in a positive way but it's unacceptable for opposition fans to use it as an insult. It's a tricky situation for the FA because they have lots of initiatives about eradicating racism from football and want to be seen to be doing something.

If it was a small or medium company it was probably the manager hiring who saw it and decided you were not suitable/didn't like xyz

If it was a large company, it could have been an auto-reject from CV scanning software (Taleo et al) because you didn't have the right keywords.

Some companies will hire on a rolling basis (i.e. the first person who ticks boxes gets an interview) others keep the applications open until X date - they will hire someone then reject others. Some will reject instantly. They could have an internal candidate in mind and are only going through the motions.

At this point you sigh and move on - it's the company's loss for not wanting you. Best of luck and can I suggest /r/resumes if you want someone to look over your CV.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; The UK government borrows only pounds. As the UK government will at all times be the safest entity that one can loan pounds to, it gets the risk-free rate of interest, a rate that for short-term debt is decided by the Bank of England.

As I've said before, I am not an economist, sadly I think I should have taken it for A-level as I do find the maths interesting, but a lot of your post is very wrong.  I'll try and expand on bits of it, but I do feel like a charlatan as this threads topic is incredibly complex.

The UK government borrows all sorts of money, some of it, indirectly.  They also can not stop a secondary market, that is the Sterling being traded by other people.  See George Soros for a good example of this.  The rate for short term interest isn't just dictated only by the BoE, it is an effect of what the market will bear.  For example Greek Notes.

&gt;When you are ensured the risk-free rate of interest, ""debt costs"" just aren't a relevant factor. They're only an issue if you there's a limit to how much you can borrow, for the UK government borrowing pounds there just simply isn't.

A note,t-bill,bond whatever.  They all have a payment to be made.  If you simply inflate away that payments worth, then the market will not be interested in buying them.

Let's not forget that a few years ago the market decided that **McDonalds was safer than the US treasury** based on the CDS spreads!

&gt;The real constraint on government spending is the economy's capacity to absorb it before raising prices. That is, if it were to allow labour to become scarce through spending too much, inflation would be the result.

No you can have high inflation whilst having unemployment.  See Labour's attempt before last to run the UK or Greece or Argentina or Vietnam.

&gt;That is the real constraint

It isn't.

&gt;imagined financial constraint of the UK government running out of pounds.

A bond default can be terrible.  Ask a Russian or Argentinian how they feel about it.  The Russian example is about as good as it has ever been done, yet the consequences would have been terrible if it wasn't for the commodity wealth they have.

However, I think most people agree that a spending stimulus would have been a great thing to be able to do back in 2009.  But the debt level and cost of managing it is high, plus we have a lot of indirect debt PPI and the like.

true,NEWSBOT3,null,null,"when i said did the maths, i spent about 3hrs before giving up because it was 2am and my brain hurt. Bear in mind that the two time periods arent really equal - essentially what you need to compare is 10 years of deposit saving, 20 years of paying a mortgage (assuming you pay it off early), and then 10 years of dumping most of your spare income into a pension vs 40 years of a pension at a much lower rate. 

You have to make a LOT of assumptions/averages too. In theory, you could put in 200 a month, self-manage your pension and put it into the highest performing funds. There are funds that pulled in 30% last year, so in theory you could invest for 15-20 years , retire at 40 and live on 2500 a month for the next 50 years. It's insanely risky, and if you managed to pull it off you could probably sell a million books on how you are the best retirement planner ever. But it's also incredibly unlikely. 

here's a very very rough set of calcs i did on my lunch break;


**Pension**


so you have to make a lot of assumptions, in practice you average about 7% on a pension fund , and to get that sort of income at 60+ you need to put in a few hundred a month minimum for the best part of 40 years plus.

assuming that 7% over 40 years, you'd have a pension pot of 1.4million pounds. Which, it turns out, is enough to buy an ok house nice nicely and STILL have a decent monthly income (roughly 3k a month pre-tax assuming you spend 50% on the house).


**now the house buying route.**


If you put £200 a month into building a house deposit and get 7% on it every year, you'd have 47.2k after 10 years, Thats' probably enough for a decent house deposit. Lets say a 250k house (iirc just over the current UK average price), so you get a 80% mortgage. However, on a 20 year term that 200k mortgage is going to have payments of at least £1600 a month (using http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-overpayment-calculator#result and a 7.5% rate). Now obviously you arent paying rent during this but you have maintenance, house costs etc. According to Zoopla (http://www.zoopla.co.uk/property-advice/rent-or-buy/) - its so close on the line that I'm going to assume you dont have any savings during this time (because they werent spent on your house etc).

So now you are 30 years in, you've got a house. You've now got 1.6k a month you didnt beforehand that you could put into your pension. Lets assume you put in 1.4k of that every month for 10 years.  That give you a 330k pension fund - which is ~ 634 a month. So having that house has cost you 2.3k a month in income. In this example its' come out clearly in the favour of the pension, which makes me suspect i've missed something but my brain hurts and lunchtime is over.

my actual IRL approach is kind of both. What i want to do is get a pension fund over 30-35 years and save up for a house deposit and pay it off ASAP once i have a mortage. Assuming everything works out as i hope, i should have the house paid off before im 45-50.

however im still struggling with various debts and being underpaid as fuck at what i do, so these things might not work out. Would be nice though.

Regardless of whether actual Christians or Jews are even involved.  This is done to rouse the emotions of Muslims.  Atheism is still not a very common idea amongst Islamic communities, so it wouldn't ring the same bells as saying ""Christians and Jews are behind this"".

true,hotcod,null,null,"There has since the financial crises being a historic raise in those who are underemployed. Our economy reacted to the crisis by spreading the work around more people instead of simply shedding jobs. This is a perfectly sensible thing for companies to have done economically speaking but it's something that hasn't really happened to such an extent before and is why our employment numbers throughout ended up higher than expected. What this means is that there is less of a correlation between number of people being employed and the hours being worked. 
 
To put it simply if every full time job was suddenly split into two part times jobs you'd vastly increase the number of employed people without an actual increase in the hours being worked. The upshot is that straight up employment numbers really tell us nothing about the economy and we really don't know what such a drastic change in the way people are being employed means for our economic recovery. 

In *this* case when the government is touting this as proof of their economic policies working it's valid that we look to see if that drop is due to their actually being drastically *more* work or if it's the result of the increased use of part time jobs as a multiplier to the an increase in job hours. 

Now I think there's no doubt that the economy is doing better and I'm not arguing that these figures don't reflect that but the huge drop isn't in and of itself important.

Even if it *is* an insult - which I don't agree that it is, in itself - hasn't it been pretty universally agreed upon that you're allowed to insult yourselves at the very least, if not others?

Are we going to tell Yiddish people they're not allowed to call each other ""mate"" now, which is pretty much it's literal translation (mate, fellow, friend)?

Outside of [The Y Word](http://www.kickitout.org/1307.php) I've never really seen anyone seriously argue this, but notice how that video does it? They're saying we shouldn't call ourselves that because it ""encourages"" chants like the Auschwitz-gas-em-again chant. Which is a reasonable point; they probably wouldn't be shouting that if we weren't called Yids. But how is *their* racist chant *our* fault? Why are *we* the guilty party for using the term in a positive context instead of the idiot racists chanting encouragement of genocide?

If we acknowledge that Yiddish people are allowed to use a word in their own language without it being offensive, we acknowledge that context matters. Hitler chants and seig heils using the word Yid are racist. People cheering and calling themselves yiddos are not.

No fan I've ever talked to has been offended by it, and no Jewish (or even non-Jewish person) has ever been more than curious about why the phrase is used when they first heard it; after a quick explanation it's either a laugh and ""Ha, I like that!"" or a simple ""football is weird.""",0,1378907321,null,0,1378907689,0,cc65qg4,t3_1m5xyy,t1_cc65qg4,t3_1m5xyy,null,1429501877,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Romania 0 - 2 Turkey

He played the full ninety, and seemingly won more aerial duels than the Hungary game which is great considering it's his weakness. He typically locked down his man plenty when it was his responsibility, too. Unfortunately he might have had a chance at stopping the first goal had he timed his jump appropriately. It was still pretty perfect placement, though, right between Vlad and Goian. Yilmaz does unfortunately have a few inches on Vlad. The 2nd goal was opposite Vlad's side so there's not much that could be said for his role or lack there of in it.

Turkey looked like Romania did against Hungary. Turkey really wanted it more, shot accurately and drew more fouls. Vlad frustrated Hungary so much he was able to draw 4 fouls as a defender. This game he had zero. 

Vlad had a better game against Hungary but that's alright. He's still the captain of a great team at the age of 23. Here's hoping the starters do well enough to get him a few minutes against Norwich.

I have friends who support Liverpool, Chelsea, Man U, Arsenal, Tottenham, Juventus, Bayern, and have come to the realization that the vast majority of the European football club supporters in America only support traditionally popular (Liverpool, Man U) or 'big money' (Chelsea) clubs.

In the immediate circle of friends I have that watch and enjoy our game, I'm the only one that doesn't support one of the bigger and traditionally more popular clubs, which is at times insanely frustrating, particularly during transfer windows when they're all talking get about how excited they are about being linked with big name players and the prospect of Champions League football, and we're stuck with holding on for dear life to the good players we have and what a dream it would be to be able to even be in the conversation for a CL spot... 

Basically this is a plea for any Blues that might be close to my area to rescue me from the insanity that I have to deal with every day only being able to chat football with Chelsea and Liverpool supporters. HELP!!

I think it should all be public record but then I think we should be more grown up about it rather than jumping up and down. Though I don't like the contrarians either such as /u/3danimator who proclaim a girl accusing someone of rape is a 'cunt' and a 'bitch'.

This is a ridiculous response. Huge differences there. Child porn, slave labour, child soldiers and assassins all inherently violate the rights of other people. Nukes don't, so would put them in a different category. Ships, planes and guns also don't inherently violate anybody's rights.

&gt;There has to be morality in foreign policy, both in terms of who you do business with and what businesses you are in doesn't there?  

But we do. We only trade with allies.

Otherwise, you're going to be in the worst business with the worst people (as we have historically been).  Absolute realism in foreign policy is a road to the abyss.  And to say others will just take our place is a cop out, albeit under the current global system it's obviously fantasy to believe we can reach global agreement on distribution of resources, and what trades humanity finds acceptable - whether or not it will ever be possible to reach unanimity on a one size fits all moral framework under a different system or to live with multiple systems is another matter entirely.

&gt; Right, but if we are one of the largest manufacturers of the best stuff, we sell to our allies. That means for the 'bad guys' to develop their own stuff or buy from smaller manufacturers costs a lot more and takes longer. Nobody is trying to unite the entire world, but making that the UK has a massive stick to wield can help to protect us and also helps stability.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I lived in Italy for a few years.  Some cultural differences I noticed.

* Personal spacing is much different in the two countries.  Italians like to stand a lot closer to each other than Britons.
* Britons don't really do cheek kissing to greet each other (this is more complicated with women, though).  Greetings between men will either be shaking hands, or, if you're friendly a head nod or ""all right?"".  Incidentally, if somebody asks ""how are you?"" or ""all right?"" as a greeting they are **not** asking you how you are.  The only acceptable response is ""good, thanks"", or a variation on that.
* Italians don't mind PDA (public displays of affection).  In Britain it's generally frowned upon to be vigorously kissing your girlfriend/boyfriend in the street.
* Italians walk a lot slower than Britons.  They also spend a lot more time eating.
* We queue for everything.  We don't queue in silence.  People talk on the tube to each other.  They don't tend to talk to strangers, same as in Italy.
* Be prepared for grating misuses of Italian in everyday life.  You want a single *panini*, not a *panino*.  Don't comment on this.
* If you go for a drink with colleagues you most likely will be using a ""round"" system, where a single person buys all the drinks for the group, with each member taking it in turns to buy.  If you do not want to buy drinks for everybody eventually you **must** make it known early.  It's considered really bad form to have people pay for your drinks and then you leave before buying a round.
* The British use sarcasm, understatement, word play and talking in circles in ways you are probably not familiar with.  The British barely ever mean what they say.  Often people will start a conversation about something completely different in order to eventually get around to the point that they really wanted to discuss with you, especially if that something is in any way negative.  Directness is considered unnecessarily Teutonic.
* Punctuality is more important than in Italy.
* It's considered polite to say ""thanks"" to a bus driver when leaving the bus if you have to walk past him to get off.
* Tipping: I usually leave 10% for good food service.  Taxi drivers will get an extra couple of pounds, or I'll round the fare up to the nearest note denomination.  Takeaway delivery I'll give a couple of pounds to.  Hairdressers I'll sometimes tip if I've had a complicated cut or we've chatted.  In London my tips may be on the low side.  It differs depending on where you are from.
* You hail taxis in Britain on the street.  Black cabs with a yellow light are available to hire, ones with the light out are occupied.  Private hire cabs look like normal cars but will have a special license on the back.  They're only available for hire via phone/internet booking and won't stop for you on the street, normally.  Stand at the side of the road and put your arm in the air to hail one.  If they drive straight past you without stopping, then you are too close to a taxi rank for them to stop without being accused of queue pushing by the other cabbies.  Follow it to find where the rank is.

I wouldn't really worry about it, though.  London is pretty diverse and there's loads of Italians there.",0,1378912313,null,0,1378912545,0,cc67ccy,t3_1m6a0w,t1_cc67ccy,t3_1m6a0w,null,1429501126,41,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,41

What I mean (maybe I wasn't explaining myself well) and I know this as a former recipient of housing benefit myself that if you stay at home, your parent gets no contribution with regard to housing benefit from you.

If you move out, you get the space, freedom, but now in addition you get extra benefits on top of your existing ones (JSA in my case, but DLA for some) to essentially pay for your housing. However this creates a disincentive from (efficient use) of housing stock because you lose the cash housing benefit allowance if you live with family. Nightmare!

What I would advocate personally is a fixed housing allowance per person regardless of whether you are living with parents or opt to move into a house share or opt to apply for a council house.

This means there is a tangible benefit to sharing with family, which gives a fair reflection of the actual economic costs. (e.g. it is a real cost if we have 5 houses being used by 5 individuals vs 1 house being shared by 5 individuals). 

For those who still want / need somewhere else to live - the option is there, but for those with the flexibility they could choose to use housing stock more efficiently and would find themselves better off. It's the same decision anyone has to make with a car currently: it's a massive benefit if you get one, but it has a cost. Some people prefer to save the money, some people don't.

That's pretty awesome! So they weren't upset about the legal stuff at all?

As you said, the interface could use updating. It looks pretty dated on my iPad TBH. Maybe do an iOS 7-style update?

The audio quality is decent in most cases, but I think some clips could do with better editing to remove laughter and other stuff (e.g. the ""people bounce back"" and ""Ahaaa!"" have some noise at the end). Also normalize the volume.

But as a soundboard app I'm not sure what other features would be needed. Here's one though:   make it possible to queue up  clips to sort of build conversations. If you also added the ability to add pauses inbetween them then people could make (and maybe even record) their own fake conversations with Alan, a la what he did with himself in *MMMwAP*.

It is a reply, to a reply about equating discrimination of homosexuals to reduction in benefits.

&gt;I can't actually believe you just wrote that sentence. What kind of idiot are you?

One who is trying to explain the difference between inaction and action.

If you want to try and suggest that a reduction in benefit, is akin to state sanctioned beatings, which the context of your reply makes clear, then I'm going to use such simplistic reduction.

Also your sexual orientation doesn't enter into it.  It is more a case of perspective in how to rank and qualify suffering.

I know you say that it puts you off that Matt Smith doesn't feel connected to Eccleston/Tennant, but honestly I always felt like they didn't quite connect with the rest of Who. Sure there was stuff there, but a lot of it was very self contained.  Matt Smith, on the other hand, has felt like(At least to me) he is much more connected with Doctor Who as a whole. When I see his performance, I see the performance of the character that has been around for 50 years.  From the way he acts to even the things he says, where some small comment references back to Troughton or Colin when they were The Doctor.

Other than that, I'd say keep an open mind and keep moving forward. After all, you're judging a new actor playing this role after two episodes!

Ugh, that dreck. 10 was an angsty, teenage Doctor. If he was human, he'd listen to emo and write terrible poetry. 

&gt;Why was there so little connection to the last series?! 

Because it's a new series, new people, new approach, new mindset. If you have a panic attack with this update of the show, how do you think people felt when an entirely *new* *Doctor Who* appeared in 1970? You went from a Doctor who played the recorder to one who drank wine, dispatched of his enemies with martial arts, and shouted down people he didn't like. 

Every time - literally, every single time there's a new Doctor, new companion, new TARDIS, whatever - people have similar reactions to yours. ""I don't get/like the change, it's so different, it's not my *Doctor Who*, I guess I'll find something else to watch, the new guy needs to go, *Doctor Who* used to be good, but not anymore"", et cetera, et cetera. 

Suspend everything you thought you knew about *Doctor Who* when embarking into a new era of the show. You enjoyed Tennant, great, but there's a new Doctor in the TARDIS, and a new guy writing stories. Things are going to be different, for better *and* for worse.

true,misterjames_,eng-kent,Kent,"I understand what you're saying but I do disagree on the point of sexual assault and rape not being worse than murder. Both are abominable crimes, don't get me wrong, and someone has to deal with the devastating consequences.

But, rape and sexual assault are commonly seen as worse than murder because the victim has to live with the knowledge of the atrocity that has been committed on them. Victims of rape and sexual assault often go on to suffer from mental illnesses and, in some cases, suicide. Victims often feel 'dirty' and 'impure' and, due to society, believe that they were assaulted because of something they had done - society shouts that they deserved it because of the way they were dressed, for example.

The same does not apply for murder victims. The victims do not have to deal with the same after-effects that rape and sexual assault cause. Of course, families and friends have to suffer as a result, but after some time, in most cases, it simply becomes like any other death. Families respect their dead throughout their lives. Some will incur mental illnesses, such as depression.

Both are atrocities and for the reasons I have outlined, I would argue that, at the very least, rape and sexual assault are crimes that are on a par with murder, if not worse.

On the topic, I do believe that rape suspects should be granted anonymity, especially in cases where high-profile figures are involved - the case should be undertaken on the low - as the public can, indirectly, influence the outcome of the court case. People are in contempt of court daily with the things they say without knowing so.

- offering additional value added services (cleaning, etc.)

My previous landlord when I was in a shared house actually did all four of the above.

But there is definitely an element of unearned profits, for a lot of landlords - this doesn't make them NOT a small business, but it makes them a unique kind of small business - it's not just a happy-go-lucky free-market phenomena. We could say that doctors and dentists are just small businesses, but they are *extremely* heavily regulated just because they have the potential to do great harm. They are a different kind of enterprise.

The fact that most landlords aren't professionals but simply do it on the side to supplement their income I think speaks volumes about how being a landlord is unique compared to other businesses.

I just find it utterly absurd that some people feel we should be forced to say to rape victims that we'll shut down a key way to produce a conviction because in some cases the public can't pull it's head of it's ass.

This was certainly how it worked under the last government. Of course, the difference is that, under the last government, people on Welfare to Work schemes were given extra jobsearch and employability training, and put in for CSCS cards, health and safety courses and other things to boost their chances of finding work, as well as being screened for basic literacy and numeracy problems (it is quite astonishing how many people have managed to muddle through to their middle age whilst being functionally illiterate, which obviously makes it almost impossible to find work in the modern day and age). Under the current administration, people on WTW schemes will be lucky to have phone contact with an adviser once a month.

In this hypothetical where the market stops loaning pounds to the UK government, are they still loaning pounds to businesses and individuals?

Because consider this. Yes, a government can voluntarily default on debt even in currencies it controls despite having no real difficulty borrowing more. Yes, it is foreseeable that when the government is threatening to do this, as America was at the last self-imposed debt ceiling debate, that some may consider McDonald's slightly safer in terms of default risk (ignoring that a US default would likely destroy the economy, taking many businesses with it).

But humour me this. What if instead of playing debt ceiling games, forever threatening to default, a currency issuer instead made it formal policy to sooner print than default should the need arise (and lets be fair, many market participants would already assume this to be the case, especially in Japan). With that pledge in place, there would never be a safer entity you could loan the government's money to than the government, for if they print it'd affect you all the same *no matter who you lend to*, but everyone else may default in addition to that risk. Therefore the government would get the cheapest lending *always*, irrespective of its debt position.

Now your counter example was Greece, however Greece borrows something it does not control, the Euro. This makes all the difference in the world, it makes the government a mere currency-*user*, just like you or I. eg if Japan were borrowing Euros they would have gone bust long ago, but they don't, they borrow yen do they continue to get the risk-free rate despite having books that don't make a lick of sense. The UK would certainly have no sooner run into problems.

&gt;No you can have high inflation whilst having unemployment. See Labour's attempt before last to run the UK or Greece or Argentina or Vietnam

Of course. Labour is just one potential supply side constraint. In the 70s for example it was energy, leading to inflation worldwide as labour was left idle. Argentina/Greece are/were import constrained thanks to policies to devalue their respective currencies and/or tight capital controls msking trade very difficult.

&gt;A bond default can be terrible. Ask a Russian or Argentinian how they feel about it.

Both those countries were borrowing foreign currencies (and/or their own currency at a fixed exchange rate, making it effectively just a proxy for a foreign currency), they are not at relevant to the discussion over a monetary sovereign that borrows onky its own free-floating currency.

&gt;Simply speaking we'd borrowed too much money before, and during the good times, squandered it, rather than invested it.

The government would have run into no difficulty borrowing more had it wanted to and it would have kept hundreds of thousands in employment by doing.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"Can you give me an example of it working like that?  Because debt is only really issued in pounds, because pounds allow 'something'.  What you describe is simply inflation.  Inflation of that kind is in a way a partial default, it means that the PDV is less.

The market, believe it or not, doesn't follow the currency that strictly, otherwise arbitrage appears.  The effect is that all they can do is create mass inflation, whilst the money market still doesn't like the underlying.  Now there was a very interesting experiment in having an inflation free currency to correct this very action in Argentina.

The problem is why does the government borrow money?  It is to pay for something, which ultimately costs will rise if the underlying cost is subject to the same inflation.  This is what happened in the 70s with state funded wages.

&gt;they borrow yen do they continue to get the risk-free rate despite having books that don't make a lick of sense.

Not really, they are paying ahead of the inflation enough for investors to consider it a worthwhile return.

&gt;Both those countries were borrowing foreign currencies (and/or their own currency at a fixed exchange rate, making it effectively just a proxy for a foreign currency), they are not at relevant to the discussion over a monetary sovereign that borrows onky its own free-floating currency.

But what about anything we import?  Ultimately we are so reliant on having imports of things such as energy.  Look at the market of inflation bonds, rates and fx.  The relationship is complex, but it is bounded.

&gt;The government would have run into no difficulty borrowing more had it wanted to and it would have kept hundreds of thousands in employment by doing.

But that borrowing costs money.  In fact just the fact Brown was gone resulted in us saving money, people who have money to invest were not confident with his 'prudence'.  Now as for it keeping hundreds of thousands employed, that is speculation.  It could have resulted in hyperinflation.

The thing is you appear to reject that servicing government debt is a cost.  It has to be.  Even if the money is 'created' by printing more of it.  That results in de-valuing everything else.

""Chelsea are tempting fate next season - with a new home strip featuring gold in recognition of London hosting the 2012 Olympics.

The Blues are unlikely to pick up even a Premier League bronze this term, currently lying four points behind third-placed Arsenal despite having played a game more.

But their new look seems to indicate they will finish first in 2012/13, with the club crest, and the the logos of sponsors Samsung and kit manufacturers adidas all in gold.

Also gold are adidas' iconic three stripes across the shoulders, the ‘CFC’ motif on the rear of the neck and the piping around the arms and neck. Shorts and socks also feature golden triple stripes.

The club say the gold theme is ""reflective of the year of sport and celebration in the capital in 2012"".

Rose's dad dying was a fixed point in time which means it has to happen. And when you try to prevent fixed points from happening bad things happen. 

This will be furthered explained in Season 4. 

&gt;The Doctor mentions ""this isn't right"" because he knows how history will play out (i'm assuming) but how did this change come to happen? how did the Slitheen appear at a point in history where they were not supposed to be? 

Remember when Rose absorbed the Time Vortex at the end of season 1 and said ""I can see everything... all that is... all that was... all that ever could be"" and the doctor responds that this is what he sees all the time.

So, the Doctor can see what the future should look like. Also, he has traveled to some place before so he knows what the place should be like at that time.

Only if you knew what they were likely to do with it.

Argos sells knives to anybody who is legal to buy one. If someone over the age of 18 buys one and stabs his mate with it, it isn't Argos' fault unless he said ""I'm buying this to stab somebody"". The only person accountable is the guy who does the stabbing. Selling military hardware or software to other countries is no different as far as I can see.

Also please stop ignoring the rest of my post. Not all ""weapons"" are offensive. And not all countries we sell to are bad. Stop trying to make it sound like we only sell guns to Saudi when we actually export worldwide.

I think the bedroom tax is a bloody stupid policy that was clearly supposed to be a spot of base-rallying rather than a sensible approach to welfare, but I also think it is incredibly bad form to do, as the UN have done:

Issue a press release before an official report. This is the biggest sin in my eyes; nobody with an interest in human rights overriding their interest in making headlines announces the results of their study before the results actually come in. It's classic academic misconduct and you can be fired for it in the private sector.

Fail to contact relevant government departments for comment before publication. This is also pretty bad, especially since the UN reporter seems to have had a clear bias going into the study (she contacted many, many anti bedroom-tax newspapers but only met one government official).

Use anecdote rather than data as the basis of a submission. This is secondary to the first point though; we literally don't know on what basis the UN are making this charge, so how on earth are we supposed to respond to it? And when the report is in, without sensible data how are we supposed to react? A list of anecdotes is not a workable data set for government.

Use deliberately inflammatory language which fails to get at the nuance of the situation (even if the bedroom tax abuses the rights of the disabled, it does not abuse the rights of the fully abled, and the UN does not make the clear at all).

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"The single-letter frequencies match up quite well with English (see below), even the bigram frequencies are about right for the first two at least (th, he). But the most popular letter ('e') doesn't match up with the bigram data. Unigrams say 'e' is almost certainly 'Q'. But bigrams say the 'h' is most likely 'Q'.

That makes me think there is a single-letter substitution cipher and a permutation cipher on top to mess up the bigrams/trigrams.

The input is 143 characters long so unless it's using a block length of 11 or 13 I think it's unlikely to be a block cipher. Plus, a block cipher would mess up unigram frequencies.

I might have a crack at permuting it a bit to get the bigrams/trigrams right, but actually the input length is probably too short for bigram/trigram frequencies to be of much help.

She issued a press release at the end of her visit to give her immediate impressions because [that's a specific part of the procedure which UN rapporteurs follow](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/CountryandothervisitsSP.aspx).

She did actually contact various government departments:

&gt;I have had the opportunity to meet with numerous Government officials, including some Ministers. In England I met with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Work and Pensions, the Homes and Communities Agency, the Department for International Development and the Manchester City Council. I also met with officials from the Department of Housing and Regeneration from the Welsh Government. In Scotland, I met with the Scottish Government, including the Housing Services and Regeneration, the Housing Supply, the Homelessness and Equality Policy Departments; and with the Scottish National Housing authorities and Planning and Architecture Division. In Northern Ireland, I had the opportunity to meet with the Department for Social Development, and with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.

Given that the [DWP confirm she did indeed meet with a very senior official](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24046094) I see no reason to doubt any of the other meetings existed - which leaves one wondering precisely how little Grant Shapps understood about this situation before shooting his mouth off.

She uses anecdote rather than data as the basis for her submission for two reasons. The first is that this is **not** her submission, but rather her immediate impressions upon the conclusion of her official visit. The second, rather more important reason is that the government has gone to considerable lengths to make it rather difficult to find official values for the following quantities: total number of individuals affected by the policy; of whom total disabled; total provision of available smaller homes ; number of sanctioned individuals with access to a smaller home; expected savings from policy in benefits bill; expected administrative costs of policy; planned construction of smaller social housing over this and next parliament... and so on and so forth.

&gt; Shopify is what I'm set on, it provides everything - hosting, support, payment gateways etc - you only need to supply a domain name and set everything up, they do the rest.

Be warned, Shopify (and also most similar websites) is primarly aimed at people selling a very limited range of items, but selling large numbers of each one. If you have more than a hundred or so SKUs they reach untenable levels, but by that time you have a significant investment in your existing webstore and won't want to change. This limits your growth potential quite a bit. The main alternative is your own webhosted site, possibly using Magento as a framework (though there are quite a few decent alternatives, Magento is simply one of the most popular so I use it as an example). This is technically (much) more difficult but potentially cheaper and more adaptable to your needs.

Also, Amazon. Really take a look at Amazon. There's some good things there if your products aren't some ultra-niche items that come without UPC/EANs.

However I suggest looking into what sort of stock control system you wish to use first.

true,Flobblem,derbyshire,"From Derbyshire, alreet youth?","Poverty does cause crime, because people lack the ability to procure basic needs and thus turn to crime to do so. To ignore this is to ignore reality.

Inequality causes many different types of crime. Poverty is in part caused by inequality. 
Unemployment is in part caused by economic inequality between the ruling class and the working class. 
Racist attacks are due to inequality that is both historical and still alive within institutions such as the police, and within education. 

Lack of social justice leads people to believe that they are not represented in the current system, that they are being treated unfairly, or leads to people realising that certain people in our society are treated more leniently by the law than others. This can cause someone to become disillusioned with the system. People like this who do not then discover some sort of political outlet (due to the inequality, poverty and lack of opportunities afforded to them) can go on to commit crime as a way of venting their anger against a system they see as having let them down. A good example of this can be seen in the London riots not so long ago. 

You are correct in that the vast majority of people work very hard in order to attain these material goods, but what of those who are unable to afford them? 
We are told to consume from the time we are born until the day we die.
We are told that only material things can make us feel whole; that if we do not have these things we are worthless. 
And yet so many people in this country are left unable to engage with this societal fetish for consumption due to an economic crisis caused by those who will never have to worry about being able to afford the neccessities of life.
In this situation, surrounded by such rabid enthusiasm for consumption does it not stand to reason that some people would resort to crime in order to take part? We are communal beings after all, so the drive to participate in mass culture is a strong one.

To conclude, suggesting that crime - that complex and many faceted aspect of society engaged in by all classes but only deemed truly awful when committed by the working class - is simply caused by people who aren't scared of the structures of control put in place by their masters is reductionist, reactionary and frankly ridiculous. Furthermore it lends weight to a fallacy which is actively damaging to society as a whole, and leads us further away from being able to solve the real causes of the problems in our society.

Edit: in this post I am only talking about working class crime, as the crimes of the ruling class would be a much bigger topic.

BTW, a complaint is a separate process. You send an email to their complaints department and quote your claim reference number so they can investigate. Complaining to the same people that handle the claim is not the way to go.
Google your local council and ""complaints process"", theirs usually four steps. Then you get to go to ombudsman whom can change policy/things for rest of claimants....

There is of course the orthodox church's who are closer to the RC church theologically but argue over things like where the church should sit (Rome/Constantinople). 

So more or less Yes if its not Roman Catholic/Orthodox its Protestant/Reformed.

The Catholic church is the name for the entire church, of denominations, which is different from the Roman Catholics which are just the one sect (ish).

However I don't think that really changes the overall thrust of what I was saying, which was that the language was inflammatory. You are correct investigators hold a press conference at the end of their visit, but you are insinuating that it is reasonable to use this press conference to announce findings from the report when that *isnt* necessarily part of their mandate - 'impressions' is not the same as 'findings' or 'results', and I don't think the distinction is academic. Since the report hasn't been published, calling the bedroom room tax a 'human rights abuse' is a little premature, surely?

The point about data is very well founded. I work in a field where that sort if obfuscation happens all the time, so I am we'll aware of the difficulty she would have faced. On the other hand, that is no excuse for bad science; if the press conference had announced, 'The UK is being deliberately obstructive in my search for answers on this topic' it would have been far harder for the Tories to dismiss her, particularly since they have signed up to the treaty saying they will NOT do this. It feeds into my larger point that this sort of shit-stirring might be great for making headlines, but is going to solidify the government position on the bedroom tax totally (which is the opposite if the outcome you and I both want). I'm all for bringing the hurt in bad government policies, but if you're going to back the government against a wall you need to be absolutely sure you know what you're doing, because I suspect this has many moderates agreeing with the Tories. I know I'm literally going to wash my mouth out with soapy water after writing this, but they are 100% right to complain to the UN over the handling of this investigation.

With regards to meeting officials, I actually just heard Eric Pickles on the news confirming he had met her, but he claims it was only for a couple of minutes.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Poverty does cause crime, because people lack the ability to procure basic needs and thus turn to crime to do so. To ignore this is to ignore reality.

Poverty does not cause crime. Many people massively poorer than criminals do not steal. Look at crime rates for the very poorest. Furthermore, the benefits system provides a safety net so that people are able to procure their basic needs. To pretend otherwise is to ignore reality. 

&gt; Inequality causes many different types of crime. 

Really? So all the law-abiding people who suffer from inequality are what? Inequality is an excuse that some criminals might use to rationalise their criminal behvaiour but it is not a cause of crime. Otherwise why aren't the crime stats loaded with wheelchair-bound, short, overweight ginger-haired women?

&gt; Lack of social justice leads people to believe that they are not represented... A good example of this can be seen in the London riots

Nonsense. The London riots began as a gangland backlash against a police shooting of a violent career criminal and escalated into principally acquisitive crime and vandalism by feral youths when they realised the police did not have sufficient numbers to curtail their behaviour.

&gt; ...surrounded by such rabid enthusiasm for consumption does it not stand to reason that some people would resort to crime

For most people, no, of course not. What you are saying is absurd. Most people who can't afford a Ferrari don't go out and steal one. But criminals do. You are confusing cause and effect, which is why your entire argument fails.

&gt; suggesting that crime ... is simply caused by people who aren't scared of the structures of control put in place by their masters is reductionist, reactionary and frankly ridiculous

Whoa there, Engels! You might not understand why phenomenological reasoning here is valid, but that doesn't make it any less so. You attempting to excuse criminals from their crimes ""is actively damaging to society as a whole"".

I've spoken to many people, some on benefits others in work. But one of the most impressionable people I've ever had the pleasure of listening to is an Afghan friend of mine. He grew up as a minority in Afghanistan during Soviet and Taliban rule, so he knows what real poverty and hardship looks like. He moved to this country a while back to find work and he's run a number of small business in his time here. One of the things he keeps trying to drum into my head is just how lucky I am to have been born in such a wonderful country, a country with such opportunity and stability. This gentleman is living proof that hard work will get you anywhere in this country.

By contrast everyone on welfare I've ever had the displeasure of speaking too is self-centred, arrogant, apparently above menial work, unambitious, complacent, lazy and they always seem to blame other people for their own problems. In some ways it isn't their fault, the problem with welfare is that it allows them to stay in this state of perpetual idleness, if welfare didn't exist there wouldn't be a welfare trap for these people to get stuck in.

* Goodbye Pond

* Clara?

* A Turbulent Flight

Episode 5 (*The Angels Take Manhattan*) had a great, tense atmosphere and the second, third and fourth tracks in my list were some of my most anticipated; I've watched the scenes with them in quite a few times (and the episode itself I've watched frequently too) and I love the music each time.

I loved Clara's theme since I first heard it. Good beat to ""A Turbulent Flight"" during the plane sequence.

Episode 7 (*The Rings of Akhaten*) was a rich one in terms of music, so it's nice to have those tracks in. ""The Long Song"" went terrifically with the Doctor's speech, and it's a track that would not be out of place in the regeneration.

The start of episode 13 (*The Name of the Doctor*) was brilliant when I first watched it, again, in part due to the music in the scene.

And of course, one I hadn't mentioned in the list; a runaway favourite...

Also as soon as I was okay to drive with a non-instructor (i.e. my dad) then I drove everywhere - pretty much every if I could. In all weathers both day and night.

I passed first time (unlike both my parents!) but it took a very long time for me to get used to roundabouts and pulling out - that's the hardest bit - learning when is safe, learning when is not safe and learning when its okay to go.  

Lots and lots of practice - as much as you can.

And once you pass - KEEP DRIVING! Do not stop practising! 

Gear changes are tricky - sit in the car while its parked up and just keep practising changing gears - you'll need it on a large roundabout when you  hit it in third and realise you need first!

Find a large long empty car park and practice speeding up and hard braking - learn what the car can and more importantly can't do.

Do not be too precious over your car - get one that's a bit damaged and expect that you will scrape it. 

Trust your instincts - if they say stop then stop.

Remember - moving the steering wheel at 60mph is VERRY different to moving in it at 30mph. High speed = subtle movements. I learnt that the fun way... scared the hell out of my poor dad too.

If you are driving without an instructor then make sure they are fully aware they are there to be your instructor - they should be watching the road and your driving as much as the instructor would - if not more. They should not be on their phone or chatting or drinking - they are effectively driving.

Remember you have a Learner sticker so other drivers know you are learning - if they toot their horn then its their problem not yours - learner will stall at lights or roundabouts - its how you learn.

Rape suspects in the UK *had* anonymity from 1976 until 1988.

It prevented the identification of *serial* rapists, because rape victims who *until the 1970s* had taken courage from the actions of other victims of the same rapists who came forward after the first accusation was made public *stopped coming forward* because they didn't know that their rapist was under investigation and didn't know that their testimony could lead to a conviction.

Imagine for a moment the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Set in place the scenario of him being alive and under investigation. Imagine the *utter lack* of any kind of national outcry as the story changed from ""National treasure revealed as multi-decade child-raping monster"" to ""Police are investigating allegations that a BBC employee may have sexually assaulted a young girl"" and the subsequent absence of any corroborating accusations.

Hell, let's take it back to the 1970s while the anonymity law was in effect, and ask whether he might have been brought to justice during his lifetime if the various investigations into his behaviour had been more widely-publicised and more victims had come forward.

Look, I understand that being under suspicion of a rape one didn't commit is an absolutely ruinous circumstance and if this were merely a question of preventing one particular harm, then this wouldn't even be a contentious issue.

But the fact is that this has been tried before, here, in the UK, and it *didn't work*. It had the unintended consequence of actively protecting the very, very worst offenders —serial, *habitual* rapists— from being brought to justice.",0,1378935622,null,0,false,0,cc6fz7r,t3_1m64gc,t1_cc6fz7r,t3_1m64gc,null,1429497029,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,LevitatingCheesecake,null,null,"Companies pay LFC to stick their logo at the bottom of the website and various other places, and if they cough up enough they’ll be allowed to publish PR pieces in the news section (like Jack Wolfskin used to). Companies that sign promotional contracts with LFC will either pay a flat fee with bonuses relating to the number of hits any page with their logo on, a flat fee with bonuses from the number of hits their site gets from Liverpoolfc.com, or a flat fee with bonuses for both. A few might just have a flat fee which is calculated from the expected number of hits the LFC website gets.


The club will be able to charge more if can make potential clients think that the number of projected hits is as high as possible. You may have noticed recently that the LFC twitter feed has had a change in emphasis. MOTM is chosen by retweeting rather than an on-site vote, a load more pictures are tweeted and they have weekly competitions. This is all part of a strategy designed to increase the number of projected hits, as they can say they have x number of twitter interactions per week and y number of links from twitter to the official site, which they use to calculate an artificially high ratio of twitter interactions : website clicks through twitter, allowing them to charge more. They’ve also made a load of foreign-language twitters to attract users who wouldn’t normally follow LFC on twitter and therefore keep the all-important ratio as high as possible. There has also been a conscious effort to copy the hugely successful tactics of the likes of like Mostar by posting shitty instagrams with quotes, or graphics from that Thai bloke that the website did a feature on last year.


Now, back to 9/11. Obviously an emotive subject, and a very famous one at that. Thousands of lives affected. Picture retweets are not only more valuable, pictures are more noticeable as they not only appear in the popular tweets section, but popular images too. Overusing YNWA also encourages fans to use #YNWA in response to just about anything, which allows the club to point to its own hashtag when negotiating. The LFC America account is notable in that it is in English, and designed to crack the American market – there is no real need for Americans to have their own LFC twitter, they can follow the English one. The whole point of it is to gain as much ‘murican support as possible. 9/11 is a great opportunity for retweets etc because so many will blindly retweet it. LFC used to just have a simple tribute on the website each year, nothing large-scale, just a tribute. Under FSG, who have attempted to maximise commercial revenue, anything that can get hits is exploited (Hillsborough is not exempt from this oversaturated coverage, Heysel is to a degree because it’s a period of club history that they don’t want to educate people about). Interviews are broken into segments and released individually, and stuff like 100pwstk is brought back as it will generate more unique hits as people try to learn about the club.


The website and social media arm of the club is designed to make money, not educate fans. Sure, they have good intentions some of the time and at least they haven’t stooped to Daily Mail’s attempts at promotion, but there is a clear tactic, which is to make as many people interact with the club as possible over the internet. I don’t have a problem with it most of the time, it’s usually informative and tastefully done, but when they attempt to get hits by reminding the world that they care about 9/11 when so few clubs bother with a message, I feel embarrassed.

true,Batcatsheep,null,null,"I think the key in a 3-5-2 are the wingbacks. They both need to have an amazing workrate and exceptional stamina, or the formation will fall apart. They need to be able to run up and down their flanks aiding in both defensive and offensive duties. The CDM's will be the same, they need to aid defensively and offensively aswell. 
An 3-5-2 have many options for build-up play. One scenario, you could see the build up play going through the middle, up to the AM who will find the killer ball to the attackers. The ball could also be passed to either of the wingbacks, who will run up the flank and cross it to one of the strikers (preferably the targetman). I think the 3-5-2 is traditionally played with a striker partnership of a poacher and a target-man. 

I think Juventus are the team who are the most succesful with the 3-5-2 at the moment. They have all the right players to make it work. A VERY strong backline in Chiellini, Bonucci and Barzagli. Two workhorses in Vidal and Marchisio, who track back all the time, and aid in offensive plays. They also get quite a lot of goals. And then there's Pirlo who is the playmaker. I think Juventus' 3-5-2 is inverted, where instead of an AM, they have Pirlo sitting behind the CDM's utilizing his long-passes. And then there's the two strikers. Juventus have just acquired  Llorente and Tevez. Llorente will be the big target-man while Tevez will be an all around striker, who will pick up loose balls in the box, and score.

That being said, I heartily disagree. Adebayor had a poor season last year, but it seems like you're taking offense with his prima donna attitude. I have to ask if you read the quotes from the article. He's pretty humble when speaking about the team the fellow strikers. He doesn't complain once about bringing in competition and actually says he prefers it when there's a battle for the spot. 

Speaking about how he has historically had to battle for a spot.

&gt;At Tottenham, there was already [Jermain] Defoe for years. Today, there is Soldado, who is a very good player and who I also respect very much. I hope he will score many goals for the team. There are stats that speak for a man in football. Today I will not tell you that I’m stronger than Soldado or Defoe or [Erik] Lamela. Do a Google search, you will see the goals I’ve scored in my career.
“We are now four in the attack, I do not know who ranks first, second or third but I know at the end I will be the first and that is the most important. Two years ago, I was top scorer and best passer at the club. Last season was not great, it is true. I do not want to relive that this season but there is no revenge or anything. This season, I have not started yet but rest assured that when I start I will be working very hard.”

You can also look at the letters that are frequently together in the cipher text (iq, qe, etc.) as these are likely to represent something like 'th', 'er' or 'an', which are commonly together in English.

As fluid as our front 3 are creativity/finding players won't be a problem it's just the CB's have everything to do with something like this working or not and it would take time to get it in working order.  Problems someone just jumping in to this run across are either the CB's being too withdrawn and losing numbers in the opponent's third or the CB's being too aggressive and getting caught out with just one at the back.  It looks great on paper if everyone does their job and more importantly if you have the correct type of wingbacks/CB's, as we happen to have.

If I saw someone who did only digital paintings I wouldn't fear for his artistic progress or assume painting in real life would be some enormous insurmountable leap of progress—the skills would probably translate fairly well.

I went to an animation school once and read animation blogs a lot at the time and this guy from Pixar when on a huge rant saying only people with talent that work at studios should call themselves character animators, and that anyone, like students, who uses the two-word phrase simply to denote they, well, animate *characters* is sullying the name or trying to make themselves sound more elite than they actually are. That drove me nuts. 

I don't wanna be that guy.

true,Tetzel,,"Manc. ","'The Disintegration Loops' by William Basinki. It's the 'soundtrack to 9/11' and it's very nice ambient music.

&gt;In the early part of the last decade, William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops was the sort of music you passed around. Once you heard it, you wanted to tell somebody about it. There was obviously the sound itself, so hypnotic that it was immediately understood as a classic of ambient music. But there was more to it. 

&gt;The Disintegration Loops arrived with a story that was beautiful and heartbreaking in its own right. It's been repeated so many times that Basinski himself has grown weary of telling it: in the 1980s, he constructed a series of tape loops consisting of processed snatches of music captured from an easy listening station. When going through his archives in 2001, he decided to digitize the decades-old loops to preserve them. He started a loop on his digital recorder and left it running, and when he returned a short while later, he noticed that the tape was gradually crumbling as it played. The fine coating of magnetized metal was slivering off, and the music was decaying slightly with each pass through the spindle. Astonished, Basinski repeated the process with other loops and obtained similar results. 

&gt;Shortly after Basinski digitized his loops came the September 11 attacks. From the roof of his space in Brooklyn, he put a video camera on a tripod and captured the final hour of daylight on that day, pointing the camera at a smoldering lower Manhattan. On September 12, he cued the first of his newly created sound pieces and listened to it while watching the footage. The impossibly melancholy music, the gradual fade, and the images of ruin: the project suddenly had a sense of purpose. It would become an elegy for that day. Stills from the video were used for the covers of the CDs, and eventually, the hour-long visual with sound was released on DVD. The video is included with the four volumes of the music and two new live pieces in this lavish and impressive box set. 

That's the story behind it.

10/10 BNM from p4k.

This is the first song (there's only 2), with the aforementioned video of 9/11.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYOr8TlnqsY

there's another song that 11 minutes long called Dlp 2.1 but youtube doesn't seem to have that track.

Anyone else a fan of ambient music? I must play Music for Airports at least 5 times a week on buses and at home for when I'm reading.

Other ambient artists I like apart from Brian Eno and William Basinki:

Fennesz

Gas

Helios

Stars of the Lid

Tim Hecker (his new album is GOAT)

I haven't got a source; but how about a bit of 6th form level mathematics?

Let's call inflation 3% over the 8 year period.

    (1+0.03)^8 = 1.26677

Let's then call the average wage, £25,000 p/a in 2015 (assuming no wage increases over the same period).  What wage would that be in 2008 pounds given the 26.7% inflation?

    x * 1.26677 = 25,000
    x = 25000/1.26677 = 19735.23

25000-19735 is about 6300.

I am curious why anyone would ever consider buying Royal Mail (obviously it depends on the IPO price, but as a growth share it seems a dead donkey, with no real scope for much in the way of healthy dividends either).

The problem with Royal Mail (as I see it), is that they are contractually obliged to handle all the low margin crap, like letters. Meanwhile they have massive headwinds with massive competition stealing away their courier business.

They've done well to arrest the huge decline in recent years (although I believe the goverment (or rather taxpayer) absorbed a mere 8bn pension deficit to keep them chugging along). 

They do have a very strong brand, and great infrastructure, so any successor would need to be capitalising on this heavily. But even then, in terms of where they can go from here, I'm not so sure even after privatisation.

It's amazing how many people I know claimed to be working class because they had an ancestor who was down the mines. My parents both one from very unremarkable backgrounds but they're definitely not working class any more 


But then again it's more than that in the uk isn't it? Class in the uk isn't just how much money you had; that new social class thing on the BBC (precariat etc) use the professions of your mates as a metric. Middle class can conjure quite different things; for example most people would see Kate middleton's family as upper-middle/upper paying for expensive boarding schools and living in the south east in a nice house but to the (remaining) established upper it's carol 'wings to manual' Middleton because her or her mother worked as a flight attendant (can't remember which). The distinctions between old money and new money could take all day. So I guess it's the social implications of being middle class - the implications of climbing up the ladder, keeping up with the joneses, debates about school catchment area etc. which seem much less generous than the idea of social collectivity that the working class have held onto (not saying its definitive but that's a popular idea)

Also it could be that especially in the south east or London traditional 'middle class' incomes don't go as far as thy used to anymore

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt;Can you give me an example of it working like that?

They all work like that. I do not know of any free-floating currency issuing governments that cannot issue short term debt at an interest rate of the central bank's choosing. Do you?

I mean, think about what that would mean. It'd be banks loaning to other banks whilst passing up opportunities to loan to the government short-term for a similar or higher interest rate. Why on Earth would they do that? If the government were to print it'd affect them the same no matter which entity they loan to - if the government were to default it'd likely destroy the economy, an irrational option for a government to take. So why would they ever sooner loan to a bank than the government?

Of course the most standout example would be Japan, they're testing this more than any other. Quadrillion yen of debt, higher than the GDP of China.. and yet still there's a queue of people looking to loan yen to the Japanese government. Of course there is, what else could they possibly do with it that would be safer?

&gt; What you describe is simply inflation. 

Printing and selling bonds is inflation now? Bonds = money? Japan's undergoing ruinous inflation?

I'm sorry, you're going to have to explain that further for me. Whilst I actually agree that bonds may as well be money, inflation-less deficits are easily possible. Just look at the US or Japan right now, both are barely touching their *minimum* inflation targets despite record deficits.

&gt;The problem is why does the government borrow money?

Because the non-government has saved money.

It's as simple as that.

To understand, consider this. Money is created through debt. You're the private sector, I'm the public sector.

If you decide, as the private sector, that you want to lower your level of savings, you can't do this by trading within yourself. That just changes the composition, but the net savings do not change. The only way you can *decrease* your net savings is by handing more over in taxes to me than I pay in expenditure. In boom times, when the private sector is debt-happy - this is what we see. The government seems to have more money than it knows what to do with, surpluses are easy. Look at the USA under Clinton (massive private sector debt bubble) or Australia under Howard (massive private sector debt bubble). Even when these governments splurge, due to the non-governments not desiring to increase their level of net savings (they'd rather spend it), the governments budget continues to be in surplus regardless.

Deficits are the opposite. The only way the private sector can en masse save the government's currency is if the government spends more than it taxes. If they succeed in net saving, the government *will* run a deficit. It's the only way the accounting can work out. In fact, as the government cannot control the non-government's overall budget it's fair to say that the budget is determined largely endogenously, that is, *by the system*.

That's why every single measure Cameron takes to reduce the deficit seems to be self-defeating. There's no surpluses despite continual cuts, because the non-government continues to net save due to times being bleak.

We simply can't all save at once, and when it comes down to a tug of war between the government and the non-government over who gets to save and who is forced to dissave it tends to be the sector with the millions of individual budgets that wins out over the single budget largely determined by automatic stabilisers. In parable form, this is explained [here](http://heteconomist.com/parable-of-a-monetary-economy/).

&gt; But that borrowing costs money.

Interest payments merely go to whoever is saving in pounds. That's what interest payments are - the subsidy on savings we all receive on our bank accounts when rates are positive. It's just rather than the government choosing how much to subsidise savings the BoE does, but it's a policy decision regardless.

Of course monetary policy is indiscriminate - *anyone* saving in pounds receives this subsidy, even if they're a foreigner. That's just the nature of monetary policy. Nevertheless, it's hard to consider it a ""cost"" in any real sense if the government can simply sell more bonds at a rate of the BoE's choosing (and for short-term debt, it always can - I challenge you to find me a counter-example).

&gt; It could have resulted in hyperinflation.

It could not have. Hyperinflation is when spending **far** exceeds what the economy can support, and normally is brought about by a massive supply side shock (eg Zimbabwe/Weimar/Hungary) combined with a ridiculously massive introduction of more spending (eg Zimbabwe/Weimar/Hungary).

I don't know of any situations where private sector demand has collapsed leading to high unemployment and massive excess supply where the government attempting to fill that output gap has lead to inflation, let alone hyperinflation. I mean, do you have any examples? And why would this be the case? In a competitive marketplace, firms sooner expand than put up prices, for otherwise they'd lose market share to those who do. I just don't see how it could be the case, nor do I know of any examples of what you're arguing.

I mean, we all agree that if the private sector were to borrow money (creating it in the process) and spend sufficiently for full employment that we'd be there without much fuss... so why do you believe that if the government were to borrow money (creating bonds in the process) and spend sufficiently for full employment that we'd instead see hyperinflation?",0,1378944576,null,0,false,0,cc6j2gs,t3_1m3o1j,t1_cc6j2gs,t1_cc69taw,null,1429495587,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In most cases, the reality is, there will simply be the testimony of the two parties.  Do I think we should prosecute such cases?  Where the victim testimony is compelling, I think we are obliged to, but naturally, such cases are very hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt, and there is always the risk of false accusations (which are nonetheless rare) and false convictions (which are rarer still).

Personally, I had a fair few. I think maybe 25 to 30 in all. But there is no right and wrong number. See when you and your instructor feel is right.

&gt;How can I combat the nervousness that always causes me to fuck up in lessons?

Remember that your instructor is there to provide a safe environment. The fear of fucking up is much worse than actually fucking up. 

So you miss a gear change and stall? So what! You're a learner - it's expected and it is how your instructor makes their living.

&gt; Should I be a little scared of my instructor?

Not at all. Remember that you're both people. She's going to try and remain as professional as possible. As I said - it's her job to let you fuck up and then tell you why you did. 

&gt; Are there any learning-to-drive tips that I should know?

Practice. If your parents have a car or something that you can [get insurance on](http://www.collingwoodlearners.co.uk). Use that as much as you can between lessons. 

Tilt your rearview mirror ever so slightly off-perfect. Not a huge amount (you still need to see backwards). But just enough that when you look behind you need to maybe raise your head an inch or two. It makes it more obvious to the examiner/instructor when you're checking behind and the little nod sticks with you subconciously (i still do it years after passing).


Good luck!

true,rq4c,null,null,"&gt; They said they had examined a number of key areas, including the primary argument against anonymity of suspects - that publicity of a person's name often prompts further victims of an offender or witnesses to an offence to come forward.

This appears to be the principal issue.

Would addressing this another way lead to broader agreement for anonymity for all?

Can we discover what it is that prevents people from coming forward 'unprompted', and then fix it?

It is often said that victims do not come forward because they fear that the police will not believe them. So is it an issue for the police to answer?

Of course, what victims probably mean is that they fear the police will 'dis-believe' them, which is different. 

It is not for the police to believe or to dis-believe. It is for them to record all statements, gather any immediate evidence, and then to determine if there is anything further to investigate.

If all victims and witnesses of crime came forward regardless, then two independent accusations would most likely lead to an investigation. No need for publicity.

Legal process should effect justice, it should not promote injustice.

**EDIT Challenge 2**

One of the primes to the above key contains ascii.ww.whtsisilguoectsrehsri.eocu./klbtehcely

Jiggle that around a bit and it becomes: www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/bletchley

Second answer was bletchley.

**EDIT Challenge 3**

Challenge 2 gives us:

Modulus (37:c0:04...) 

public exponent (0x10001)

private exponent (13:5b:5d...) 

1024 bits

Stick it into a handy dandy RSA decryptor and we get:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/enigma2013

Answer 3 is enigma2013

**EDIT Challenge 4**

I didn't recognise the picture. Stuck it in www.tineye.com and it turns out to be a computer used for ciphers called ""Colossus"". This is answer 4.

Unfortunately I have no fucking idea what answer 5 is because I can't seem to find a clue for it. So I'm stuck :( I'm unfamiliar with how Colossus works, presumably I need to do something with the prior challenges and how colossus works to come to an answer. Research ahead I think.

If anyone works out the answer before me please do let me know :)

**EDIT:**

On second thought, I'm going to trawl around all the british newspaper websites with ""www.fjisogsaga.co.uk/colossus"".

Given the last clues all had this pattern, the final challenge is probably out there on another newspaper site using the previous answer as the url.

**EDIT**

Found it. www.standard.co.uk/colossus

Last answer is **secured**.


***

**Extra edit:**

There's some oddities in all of this and while I didn't do anything with the previous challenges they've put on, some research shows there have been secret challenges in other years that were significantly harder. These were all relatively easy. Going to dig around and see if there's any oddities, probably in the RSA key, maybe the exif data on the colossus image, or the code that presents that image, or the code behind any of the pages here, or that which submits answers. There's probably something else going on here, I'm much much more interested in digging up any possible leads on something like that, these weren't tooooo difficult really. Just had to research what you were looking at and it takes you down a rabbit hole. I know nothing about any of the above. The first one looked something similar to enigma code from some documentary I once watched so I looked up ciphers, the second RSA one I just looked up RSA stuff, this led me to knowing about the info in that for the third one, then 4 and 5 were relatively easy.

I'm not.  I'm not even claiming we are indiscriminate.  We discriminate quite a bit.

You probably want to look at deaths + ~~fatalities~~ injuries per fire over time. The number of fires in London has been declining... so normalizing for per fire gives a better sense of whether or not things are improving or not.

You also probably want to look at response times... how soon the first pumper arrives, how soon the second pumper arrives. I strongly suspect fatalities and injuries to correlated highly with response time (the slower the response time the more deaths/~~fatalities~~injuries). 

If I'm correct in my suspicion then response time is the best statistic to use to determine whether or the fire service has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse.

Even in an educational setting though, this would be disruptive. If I were teaching a class I would want to be able to identify my class - how can that happen if half / all of them are completely covered besides their eyes? Should they be made to wear large name badges that can be read from anywhere in the room? To sit in certain places and never move so that they are known to me? It's not an ideal situation.

true,txteva,null,null,"&gt;She wants a security deposit and the first rent deposited at a realtor before sending us the keys for our first visit. 

Are you asking her to hold the flat for you (i.e. not allow others to view) before you visit? If so then its a perfectly reasonable request. You say you are being sent the keys for the visit - if so then I would certainly expect to have to pay a deposit - what if you refuse to send them back? Personally I would not take money until I had met the person directly. Prehaps she could send the keys to the estate agent or letting agent (realtor is an American term) and not to you directly then the agent can do the viewing.

Once you agree to rent then a deposit and first months rent is common before you move in - some people will just ask for a deposit and then first months rent is due on move in date. Some places will ask for 6 months rent as a deposit if you do not have a job. 



&gt;She just wants a 30 days notice before we move out. Here it's 90 days.

This would be common for most places (normally if you pay weekly then you give a weeks notice, if you pay monthly then you give a months notice).




&gt;She wants to rent the place for ""at least"" two months. Usually renting such a place here in Germany is unlimited.

Renting can be for 6 months, 12 month contracts or can be a rolling month contract where there is no set term and either party can cancel with 30 days notice.

I hope you're referencing, at the very least, final year undergraduate students. Post-graduate students are in academia for a reason, if they wanted to work on these kinds of systems they could, but instead they're pursuing masters and doctorates.

As students we are in university to be educated in computing of which part of this are the methods of producing large scale systems such as what the government require. Unfortunately not all of that can be taught in a 3 or 4 year course and we still spend a lot of time in the first few years of work learning a lot; project managment, team working skills, documentation, testing. The list really does go on.

While I agree that there are some students who when assembled together in a team could most certainly produce a system of a high enough standard for continued governmental use, the logistics of assembling these students together would take a lot more effort and possibly cost just as much as a standard contract.

In 2007 (Ken) it was 54 fire fatalities. 

In 2011 (Boris) it was 56 fatalities. 

2008 was clearly a lucky year at 41 since it wasn't repeated and the average through the whole of Kens term and Boris's is more like 55. 

The stats are completely meaningless. One bad house fire with a family of 5 and it throws the stats right off. 

For a city of some 8 million odd, 50 odd fire deaths a year is astonishingly low. 

Boris probably should have pointed out that when the stats are that low the % increases look a lot more drastic.  

You can technically say that under Boris fire deaths went up 36% and you'd be completely right. However it's a misleading statistic because of how small the number already is. 

For example, if you have 2 deaths in one year, then 1 death the next year you can truthfully say that you've reduced the fire deaths by 50%... But really it means nothing because that could just be fluke.

In saying that I had a similar experience to you, 2000 miles just over a year on a small bike 3 days training on a 650 and breezed through my full test I couldn't believe it was so easy.  Edit:  When I say 3 days, first day was mod1 training, second day was a bit of training then mod 1 and third day was a bit of training and then my mod2.

**TIPS**

* Be confident - you have the experience, people pass the test with much less so you are at a massive advantage to them.  If you think about it there are people going through the DAS with no background at all and passing so they are not expecting you to be an expert rider, all they expect is for you to be safe. 

* Listen to your instructor - he/she will be full of handy tips, one thing my instructor did was take me down a 20mph speed limit road I did not know about the day of my test.  Just so happened on my independent ride I ended up on it.. what a life saver.

* Ride how YOU ride - don't ride how you think the examiner wants you to ride.  It is hard to keep up a riding style that is not yours for the whole test and you will eventually trip yourself up.  If you are not safe riding the way you ride maybe you need to think about more training as you want to live to be an old rider.

* If you think you have made a mistake - CARRY ON, I thought I was making mistakes all over the place as I was being very over critical of my own riding when I wasn't really making any.

* Most of all have FUN - treat it as a day out, you know you can ride the bike just relax and have fun riding a bigger bike for the day.

**MOD 1**

* This will be a cake walk for you - Just remember every time you stop and move off to do your shoulder checks.  You will have a good grasp of the maneuvers from your time on the road.

* Listen to the examiner.

**MOD 2**

* As I said ride how you ride, try not to be too critical of yourself and relax.  Don't worry about the examiner just ride as if he/she is not even there.

* Ride positively.  Example:  On my test I came around a corner to find a learner driver sitting at the set of red lights before turning on to a dual carriageway.  When the lights changed the driver moved off VERY slowly and entered a national speed limit area.  I overtook the learner very soon after entering the road and checking everything was safe.  They want you to ride positively and safely not like a timid mouse.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Caesar was the weird combination of a genius, megalomaniac and an impoverished noble. The upper classes hated him. The man grew up with ordinary people and associated more with them than with the men of his birth right. Everyone knows that Caesar seized power to effectively dodge a  trial. What they rarely know is what he was being tried for was violating the sanctity of a holy day so that he could pass laws that redistributed land.

There is no doubting the megalomania part though. At worse Caesar would have been banished for his crimes or barred from public office. He stole control of the republic because he believed he was obviously the best man to run it. If there was no conflict and he had been allowed to run for Consul in absentia as he asked then he'd likely have never done it.

There is a lot of propaganda around the emperors. Domitian is another who's name has been partially cleared. In at least that his previous status as a Caligula or Nero has been undone. Lots of historians now credit Domitian's economic reforms and focus on the Limes Germanicus with creating the conditions that allowed the 5 good emperors and the golden age of Rome to occur. While still acknowledging him as an autocrat.

This said Nero is another who's reputation is out of sync with his actions mainly because the Catholic church spotted him as an early persecutor of Christians.

Context sensitive rules sound like a decent idea - but could be needlessly complicated quite quickly. If they're worth stopping at all in a school, there shouldn't be an exception. If you're at school - they're banned. I doubt safety is the sole reason involved - look at it from a teachers perspective. How can you keep control of a class when you can't actually see who is who? If a fight breaks out amongst children, how can you tell who was involved? 

A child or adult wearing a balaclava wouldn't be allowed on school grounds unless it was removed. If that's a fact, then it should apply to *all* clothing that covers the face. Its religious connotations should not mitigate that. 

With regards to intolerance - there's more than one kind of intolerance. I don't think the argument that faces should remain uncovered to ease identification, communication and interaction with society is intolerant. What concessions have these people had to make?

Romelu is the only one who will leave undoubtedly next year. This gives us a whole year to look for a striker and presumably we will spend whatever money we get next year on the new striker.

But I think you'll find that much of the frustration that comes with train delays is the complete lack of any information or updates as to what is happening for perhaps hours on end.

You'll just be sitting (more likely standing because there aren't enough waiting seats) at the station, just watching the arrival board as the estimated arrival time of your train keeps changing again and again. *19:30 delayed to 19:45.* OK, no problem, but it is now 19:50. *Update: 19:30 now delayed to 19:55* and so on.

And 90% of the time, the staff won't tell anyone why the train is delayed so much. You're just left wondering what the hell is going on out there. Especially if you're already in a train. The train will just stop in the middle of nowhere for an hour. You're crammed like sardines in the aisles and no one thinks it wise to inform the passengers what is happening.

I don't think there's anything wrong with adults watching what is essentially a children's show, as many can reach across the generation. This obviously applies to Doctor Who as well, otherwise it wouldn't have the huge adult fanbase it does.

Where I absolutely agree with him is how seriously some of us can come to take it.  We may want it to be written more seriously, we may want it to be some champion of social issues, we may want it to be written for adults...but it's not.  It's a children's show. I know a lot of people around here get offended when you say that, but it's true.  It even boggles my mind when people complain that Moffat writes the show too much like it's a children's/family show. Well guess what, mission fucking accomplished.

I'm as huge a fan as anyone, and even I can admit that much.  It's a children's show, and it's written for children. Can it be enjoyed as an adult? Most definitely, but as Mitchell states, it's most certainly is a fringe benefit. The fact that we can enjoy it, and enjoy it on the level that we do, is simply a bonus.  The fact is, whether we want to believe it or not, the show is not written for us. It's not written for people aged 18+.

Although anyone that does want a more adult Doctor Who, there is hope. I can say it until I'm out of breath, even though my words often fall on deaf ears.

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"&gt; as a growth share it seems a dead donkey, with no real scope for much in the way of healthy dividends either  

I'm not sure here. Right now it's profitable, and that profit has to go somewhere. They might pump it into expansions that are unprofitable, but they might be successful. And if they don't surely it will be a dividend stock? I'm expecting the latter but I'm interested to see what an ambitious CEO could do here.  

&gt; The problem with Royal Mail (as I see it), is that they are contractually obliged to handle all the low margin crap, like letters.  

This is an important. When the announcement was made I'm sure I remember a mention that it was an obligation for 5 years, but now [this article](http://postandparcel.info/56830/in-depth/royal-mail-privatisation-going-ahead-a-briefing/) suggests it's going to be ongoing with OfCom overseeing it. While it's a problem for keeping profitable, it also keeps them well known and in operation. It's also worth considering the possibilities here - if they're contractually obligated to make certain journeys six days a week, they could deliver other services along those routes (for instance, groceries or other goods to retail) for a price that undercuts their competition because they need to make at least part of the trip anyway.  

&gt; Meanwhile they have massive headwinds with massive competition stealing away their courier business.  

I think they've been short-sighted here in that they've treated their courier business the same as their letter business, in that you need to find a post office or depot to send it. If they collected parcels like their competition, and had local depots for collection (closer than most couriers) if they missed you, with the infrastructure already in place there's no reason they shouldn't be more competitive here. I'm interested to see how the private sector addresses this.  

Maybe my idea of them (expanding out to compete with drop shippers and couriers of anything) is a little ambitious, but they are profitable even with the public-sector bureaucracy on top. If they just keep going as is, and don't make any stupid mistakes, that profit (theoretically) has to be pumped into either the share price or the dividends. I agree they're not as sure a bet as other privatizations, but even those have their problems (such as United Utilities not being allowed to turn off water for non-payers). I think I'll take a bite, but I'll wait to see what the IPO is, I may wait for a few months.

I have no sympathy at all for anyone who decides to jump in front of trains, nor do I have any sympathy for Southern Rail and their 'rolling stock issues'. This is a problem that comes up 2-3x a month minimum so for a company that is turning over £100 million profit in 2012 (before recent fare rises) to not have backup plans that can kick into action quickly is a farce. (perhaps buses being a pretty simple answer)

There are also other solutions to be offered - walls between track and platform akin to the ones we see on the tube - or take Japans route and fine the families of those who do jump. Both perhaps would be classed as drastic action, if it solves the problem then I am all for it.

The train companies also offer little to no information on what is happening, the most you receive is an automated transmission over the tannoy

It appears the article is saying that we should all stop and think about the way we react when these incidents occur and we need to have more sympathy for the families of and the people who jump - it is something I cannot do. The regularity of these problems is a headache for thousands of people on top of an already heavily crowded and old rail infrastructure that we pay more and more for every year. As pointed out in other comments these delays can affect many people in many different ways whether it is the staff who deal with the mess after or someone attending an interview (that's without thinking about the countless other scenarios) so for me personally I do not see the need for compassion for a (rational or irrational it makes no difference) jumper, there are far more pressing situations in this world that require our thoughts. Heartless? Maybe, Realistic in the terms of something NEEDS to be done? Definitely 

This is a topic that as a daily commuter into one of the main stations I find interesting, I know many people who completely agree with my point of view and I know many who prefer to look on the other side. Perhaps sadly there are far more who would agree.

I've heard the US netflix is considerably better, but I've got to be perfectly honest and say there's more on netflix UK than we will ever be able to watch in our lifetime.   Then again, we are not avid TV users, weekdays usually too tired after work, dinner cleaning etc to do more than veg on sofa for an hour. Weekends we are usually busy so again, maybe an hour or something.  'power' TV users might be more inclined to feel it's not got an amazing selection.

I guess if you are not too fussy about the latest releases it's fine. I do believe there is a way of accessing US netflix in the UK via use of a VPN/proxy - but I'm the type of person who would google it and follow instructions but not understand it ;-)

&gt; First and foremost the government is selling something to raise money. The UK government—as a result of spending more than we could afford for decades—is in massive amounts of debt. This will help that.

Totally understand this, but as RM is now making a profit, surely long-term it would make more sense to keep it nationalised and plough those profits into paying off debt? If you sell it, you only get the money once, not ""forever"".

&gt; Second is a belief that private companies, with a motive to produce profit, will be more efficient (to reduce costs) and be better at giving customers what they want (to increase revenues). Whether this makes sense given Royal Mail's near monopoly is questionable.

I don't get this one. Yes, in theory, this makes sense, but why can't the current ""owners"" make the same changes? Most of the previous privatisations haven't exactly ended up fulfilling this belief either.

&gt; It also allows Royal Mail chance to make decisions based on commercial sense, rather than be bound by the whims of ministers in whitehall who, for example, may know that a decision is bad but don't want to be seen making a U-turn.

See, now this is a problem with MPs ... they'd rather continue with a bad idea than look bad on paper. Sad.

We would have Holtby free and clear if we waited, he was already signed to a pre-contract to us. We wanted Holtby on the roster but i don't think we wanted him enough to agree to anything like a buyback clause, why even risk the possibility of a buyback coming up where if you just wait you get him with no strings especially when Holtby was so highly regarded around Europe as an up and coming prospect.  At that point Levy had all the leverage, we wanted Holtby but we didn't explicitly *need* him last winter. We were going to get him for free and Shalke was going to get nothing and would have a player on their roster who was already committed elsewhere (which traditionally turns out poorly for the team) if we waited so we paid a small amount of money and Shalke went and brought in Michel Bastos as a ""replacement"".

I can't see Levy agreeing to a buyback even in a limited situation because Holtby was so highly regarded, it would be an unnecessary risk.  We wouldn't put anything in where it was a situation where a player ""works out"" who would determine the category for a player ""working out""? What if Shalke viewed Holtby not starting as ""not working out""?....Shalke would want some sort of defined ability to buy Holtby back, be it a timeframe or a right of first refusal and Levy wouldn't likely agree to anything that puts Spurs in a spot to potentially lose out on a large sale.  

For a player like Holtby who was so highly regarded around Europe (this is a guy who was mentioned as a promising young CM along with Eriksen) i think Levy would just take the gamble and pay, odds are 2-3 years (when he is still only 24-25) down the road even if he doesn't work out you will still break even (given we paid so little for him) or turn a profit (whether he was free or cheap).

The buyback clause is a complete non-starter for me, there would be no reason for Spurs to agree to it as there is absolutely no advantage for us in agreeing to it. ",0,1378988521,null,0,false,0,cc6tctz,t3_1m7rpr,t1_cc6tctz,t1_cc6t1d8,null,1429490641,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Governments can’t stop the business cycle; there will always been booms and busts. If not for a credit crunch the recession would have been caused by something else at some point. The failure of successive governments not to save during the good times so that they could survive during the bad is the real mistake by government—whose debt we're talking about—and the reason we’re now having to borrow so much. 

Only in uncompetitive or cartel-like markets can private companies increase prices at whim. That’s why we have the competition commission (although if you ask me they don’t do enough). Otherwise companies have to take the market price and do their best. Mail won’t be a competitive market, hence my caveat. Stifling competition? Really? You think board members sit around and say “right, we need to increase revenues, how can we stifle our competition”?

Shareholders whims are pretty constant: increase profits.

Edit: I should highlight that I am against privatisation for RM. For most markets I would prefer private rather than public, but the key requirement is competition. Unless you can introduce genuine competition then you’re just creating monopolies. Private monopolies, I agree, are terrible things. If we must have monopolies they should be public. That said, if someone can figure out a way to privatise royal mail by somehow splitting it up into many different pieces – like Lloyds and TSB are doing but into many more peices, I would be for it.

The money you save may or may not be greater than the money that Royal Mail could bring in, but it is certainly a lot less risky. What happens if everyone stops sending mail because the older generation die out and everyone’s now sending e-mail? The value of royal mail decreases, and the government ""loses money on its investment"" because it had the chance to sell it and didn't. Do we really think the government should be gambling on the future of industries with public funds? If someone has to risk their money, isn't it better it's shareholders?

The current owners can make the same changes. The point is that without the profit motive they are not as motivated to do so. Many privatisations have done this effectively: Rolls Royce, BA, BAA etc. But, as I said, the key is competition. Only with competition is there an external control on prices. 

I agree it’s problem with MPs. But there’s other political things that can conflict with the best interests for the end user. Take, for example, the amazingly low number of teachers that have been sacked in the last few years. Instead of getting rid of bad staff, they just get moved around.

So this stems from the Utopia episodes and the first Master arc.

Let's assume that Captain Jack WAS still alive in the human survivors. It is entirely possible and in fact was hinted at. So at the time the events are occuring there's 2 Captain Jacks out there at the end of the universe. One of them happens to go to Utopia and gets changed into a Toclafane. However, being Captain Jack and cleverer than most, instead of following the Master he decides to go off on his own, maybe using the time rift to go back to a much earlier point in time where he starts to live out his life as ""The Face of Boe"" (since he his now literally a face). Eventually he grows up to be a bigger face (I'm not sure how). This would also explain how the Face of Boe knew that the Doctor was not the last Time Lord and was able to tell him so. 

Another theory that stems from this of mine, is that at some point in time The Face of Boe faught the Master and won but couldn't kill him, so instead he trapped him with the fob watch and gave him the name ""Yana"" and left him on a beach (in the same place the Face of Boe is from)

The films available are a lot better I find the films load quicker (may just be my internet)

I tried Amazon Prime for a month but decided to knock it on the head as I don't buy enough monthly to make the most of it and without the Amazon Movies perk that you get in the states it just seemed pointless. 

Google Music is great in the UK same features as the U.S so nothing to complain about there it is definitely a must have if you are an Android user. 

I would say that calling the UK versions ""abysmal"" is a bit of an exaggeration sure, they could do with some work but over time they will improve. Also if you are semi tech savvy there are many work arounds to get the US versions if you so desire.

The fans care about 9/11, and sure, most of those who work for the club do as well. There was probably a genuine effort to commemorate 9/11, but it got caught up in the 'you must post it with a shitty graphic and try to maximize content' rule that got implemented a few months ago.

The club is a business. It is a business that has made huge strides in social media in the past few years. Have a read through of [this](http://www.trufflenet.com/success/strategy-audit/), it's a really brief outline of the social media plan.

Or [this](http://www.sportspromedia.com/guest_blog/inside_liverpool_fc_thinking_global_acting_local/), which shows how Liverpool have been using social media to make as much £££ as humanly possible.

From the above article is a great little bit that shows how marking significant cultural events can have such a big impact in terms of fanbase, and money generated:

&gt; Liverpool দলটারেকখনওপছন্দকরতামনা, ম্যানইউ'রসাপোর্টকরিদেখেএক
&gt; প্রকারঘৃণাইকরতাম।কিন্তুআজকেএইদলটাওমনেরমধ্যেএকটুজায়গাকরেনিলো!

&gt; The message was in Bengali and posted on the Liverpool FC Facebook page by a Manchester United fan. Translated into English, it said: ""I never liked Liverpool FC. Actually, I used to hate this club because I love MUFC. But today LFC have taken a place into my heart! Massive respect to this club!”

&gt; The date was March 26 2013, Independence Day in Bangladesh. Earlier that morning, Liverpool FC's Bangladeshi Twitter correspondent had posted a message in Bengali from the club to our fans on the @LFCBangladesh Twitter account wishing them a happy independence day.

&gt; Rabi, the country’s second largest mobile operator, even shared a post on Facebook, announcing: “A great gesture from the world-famous English football club Liverpool FC, wishing all Bangladeshi Liverpool fans on our Independence Day”.

&gt; That original tweet - and the incredibly positive reaction to it from both LFC and non-LFC fans - quite neatly illustrated Liverpool FC's recently launched international digital strategy. Think global, act local – entertain, expand and, most importantly, engage.

Picture RTs are valuable. Notice how the club does [teamsheets](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BSsVWWLCMAAQ1Hm.jpg) now?

From LFC Bangladesh, in the last month alone:

[Hashtag Mignolet #Beast](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BSC3EELCIAA-uL1.jpg)


The club saw that twitter users like MostarLFC were getting huge numbers from these types of posts, so decided to go out and copy them. It worked.

It's what Ian Ayre said. He's selling fans in lucrative markets a product. The golden rule of social media is engage, engage, engage.

It's a very structured set up which would be best for someone who's never been anywhere in Africa before and wants to do hands on labour on a very specific project.

The smaller, independent organisations tend to take you to projects that are complete and the fee would go to the day to day running of the project.  You'd also book your own flights etc.  From time to time they might have enough cash put aside for a proper building project but I think most people would find they'll spend their time teaching etc. rather than doing manual labour on a big project.  What they are left with after the cost of hosting you is significant but its not going to cover a huge project.

true,artismyhustle,cnty-england,The civilised south.,"&gt; Henry VIII - responsible for the reformation in England, founded the Church of England, introduced a progressive tax system and promoted a parliamentary government. Laid the groundwork for the Royal Navy that would ensure 400 years of prosperity.

None of these things are remotely of the calibre Washington or Lincoln Achieved and he butchered most of his wives. 

&gt;Elizabeth I - took a country that was almost a vassal of France and Spain and secured it. Saw off the Spanish Armada, standardised the national currency and brought about nearly 50 years of stability. Largely responsible for the secular state that England became. Not to forget the patronage of the Arts that gave us Shakespeare.

50 Years of Stability, well that sweet but Washington's peaceful transfer to John Adams has continued to the present day and Lincoln saved the Union in the only time of massive political crisis. You'll noticed that the transfer between monarchs is usually a very unstable affaire. As for the secularism, well Washington and Lincoln were presidents and one of them co-founder of a constitutionally secular country. Elizabeth I is Queen, a very non-secular idea in itself, and the head of the State Church. Somehow the word 'secular' and Queen Elizabeth don't quite go together...

&gt;Victoria - completely changed the role of the monarchy from one of dictating policy to an advisory role. Turning it from a near reviled institution to one that was seen as essential to the country. Reigned over the Empire at its zenith, and had probably the single biggest cultural impact on the world for a non-religious figure.

Fucking hell, what does he think ""housing bubble"" means?

A house is the same house as it was ten years ago; there is absolutely no reason for them to have outpaced inflation.  They are not an investment, they are a place to live.

If house prices dropped, then rentals would drop, if rentals dropped the poorest would benefit most.

So then, why have house prices gone up?  Simple supply and demand; the NIMBYs of the world, hand in hand with the government, have put an effective halt on any significant house construction.

Learning through play is a key part of this in early years.  Assessments are done while a child is playing or taking part of an activity.  Let's say child A is drawing a picture of Mummy.  You can ask A about parts of the body and judge their knowledge that way.  This goes into their assessment files at the end of the day as you notice them hitting their educational markers.  Open-ended questions are encouraged, such as children asking about the sky say, or why there are no dinosaurs.  This can lead onto a topic of dinosaurs where you can encourage children to do research and activities.  Maths can be done while setting the table for snack e.g. how many plates do we need for this table.

Sorry for all the examples, but that's a little sample of what we had in the nursery I worked in.  The CfE is certainly good for younger years which is more fluid because of the learning through play, but it does seem to be a bit too hazy for later years (or it was while I was working in education).

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","I'm not looking to convince anyone of anything - I'm certainly not egotistical enough to *know* that I could talk someone out of suicide or convince them to change their methods. 

However the blog piece in question plays on the loss of life, of the tragedy of the individual and how rude others are when they're unhappy with the train service. However it cleverly overlooks the selfishness of suicide in this manner. 

I did say suicide is tragic. In fact it's the first thing I said, as I believe it and as I knew it was necessary to say it because folks like you come along shouting ""ignorance"". You're not the first person to point out that suicidal people are not thinking logically so I invite you to read other comments here to catch up on how you're a) right and b) that doesn't alter that choosing *this* death is a selfish act. 

&gt; The only purpose this line of reasoning serves is to upset families who see their loved ones death spoken about in such callous terms 

What about the train driver and their family? What about the people who had to clean up the scene or were sat at the front of the train and maybe heard a 'thump' of flesh on metal colliding? Do they get any consideration? 

What it seems you're forgetting about suicide by this method is that it affects many more people than just the dead person and their families. It is public. It is messy. It needs cleaning up. Tens / hundreds / thousands of people may be affected during the hours it takes to clean up and sort out the mess. 

As I said before, it *is* tragic that anyone feels unable to cope with existing and feels the need to end it. I am actually in favour of allowing assisted suicide in the UK and have been following Terry Pratchett's case with some interest as he campaigns for his right to die as he chooses - unfortunately he has Alzheimer's. However you are asking me to mince words - to put up and shut up - and pretend that someone choosing to die in this manner is not being selfish and that they're not affecting many more than just themselves and their relatives. 

My heart goes out to families who have had to deal with suicide and to those who feel suicidal. A number of friends of mine have and possibly do practice self harm - I do not make light of their situations. 

That doesn't alter the selfishness of choosing to throw yourself before a train. ",0,1378998295,null,0,false,0,cc6vz1m,t3_1m8id3,t1_cc6vz1m,t1_cc6vmbc,null,1429489420,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4
