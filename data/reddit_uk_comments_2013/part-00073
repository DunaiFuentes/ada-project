Villa don't really do hold-up though, it's more 'lob it and pray', so with a more active midfield giving him more outlets he might be better at this.
* Rubbish pass completion. Averages around 60% I think. It seems like he's not fully aware of the kind of passes he's actually capable of. This point and the last mean we'd lose possession often with him in the team. Once again, having midfield players in better positions might improve this side of his game.
* To complete the trinity of possession-wasting: he is caught offside more easily than any other player in the league. I realise getting caught offside occasionally comes with the territory when playing off the shoulder, but considering how deep Villa play this is just silly. This is his weakness I'm least confident of him being able to correct in a better team.

I'd be happy if we got him, but I do think he's overrated. I think we have better options at the fee he'd command even if Villa do go down. Aubameyang, for example, would probably cost about the same, is almost as big, the same age and just strikes me as a better player. I also think Benteke would be a little wasted on us because we play few high balls and few crosses of late, so his main talent - his insane aerial ability - would not be put to full use.",0,1366027817,null,0,false,0,c9fjgde,t3_1cde5o,t1_c9fjgde,t1_c9fi81j,null,1431551764,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

I've seen some worthwhile comments of yours over the last week or two, but I don't believe this is a useful interpretation or understanding of the concept of a ""social contract"".

*[The Social Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_social_contract)* questioned the ""divine right"" of the king's rule, and talks of citizens banding together to form democratic government (which did not exist in Europe at the time the book was written).  

So now the ""democratic"" government assumes authority over the citizen, and it enforces that authority with police and prison - that side of ""the social contract"" is well-enforced, and the citizen does not have the choice to consent or decline the ""contract"".

Thus when we talk of ""the social contract"" it's only meaningful to talk of the moral obligations of the rulers.

The citizen has no recourse against a corrupt state, and the state only has the moral authority to rule if it does so actually in the bests interests of the citizenry (and not just in claim).

true,benmuzz,derbyshire,Derbyshire,"Sorry I was being rather facetious. But I've always heard a different side of the story. Many of my family were builders. Dirt poor, always out of work due to the nature of the trade, and living in a council house. Without Maggie's reforms their progeny would likely have followed in the same pattern, stuck at the bottom, destined to pay for their council house 10 times over in rent by the time they died. Instead, my great grandad was able to buy the house that he'd lived in his whole life, and suddenly he was on the property ladder. Thatcher's deregulation of the banking sector brought international competition and changed it from an exclusive old boy's club for toffs into a competitive meritocracy. Two of my uncles moved down to London and were able to get jobs in trading, and quickly became very well off. My dad, who remained a builder, loved maggie because she released the stranglehold of the builders' union (previously, you could hardly find work unless you were a member of the union. People were joining their babies to the union to ensure they found work when they were of age). Then when she took all the council red tape out of the business regulations, my dad was able to start his own small business, employing young apprentices, which wouldn't have been possible before Maggie. He'd never been able to get a loan before (the snooty banks didn't give them to people in the unstable trades) but with the newly competitive banking market he was able to get one and fund his new business.

Basically, according to my family: before she came along, everything seemed designed to keep the poor man in his place. Afterwards, anything was possible.

Some places had a hard time of it, but she definitely helped the poor, that's why they left the Labour party in droves to vote for her. The socialist policies never gave the poor what they wanted: a chance to better themselves.",0,1366030966,null,0,false,0,c9fk1qo,t3_1cc4gd,t1_c9fk1qo,t1_c9fj51z,null,1431551412,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

It shows that most people earn 10-15k after tax.  However the mean average will be considerably higher.

So if you take the mode average it is 10-15k, but the media average is considerably more, the mean average even higher.

So whilst the 'average' might have been £244k, the most commonly sold might be just £80k.  For every russian oligarch buying his mayfair shagpad estate, that counts as £50M or whatever, this means that if only 100 homes were sold that week in London, the average price would be £500k per home higher.   This is why the mean average is meaningless.

Also we have geographic issues, someone has moaned that £35k isn't enough a year, and someone from Cornwall commenting that they'd love to have that.  Each geographic area will have another set of what is average house prices.

Our social welfare system delivers benefits relative to a combination of your income and situation, so if you’re on low income with a family support you could be entitled to any number of different benefits (low income support, council tax relief, child tax credit, housing benefit, etc). 

As I said, many people are having to cope with no pay rise at all. A 2% pay rise should be considered reasonable, particularly as it comes on top of the raising in personal allowance (which would have a bigger impact on people on low incomes).

true,novicegrammarian,null,null,"You bring up a really good point about intonation, and I appreciate the feedback. That is actually the holy grail of speech synthesis--NOBODY can make a model of intonation that works (yet). In synthesis, intonation is known as part of a bunch of non-specific phenomena in speech called ""prosody."" Prosody includes things like pauses, intonation, and so on that don't get associated with just one sound but with a sentence or a text overall. Prosody is hard to model because it is dependent on semantics and individual people and so on, and that's really difficult to capture. The rise and fall is the pitch contour, or technically, the F0 contour. Unfortunately, the jumpy pitch contouring you hear is a result of the recordings of my voice. I am terrible in a sound booth. :) 

The synthesis system in the experiment is actually a state-of-the-industry unit selection system. It is not as refined as you would have in the industry, and the industry uses some hacks so that it's never really bad for them. The system used for the experiment was Festival, a research system at the University of Edinburgh almost 20 years back (a total dinosaur written in multiple programming languages, but still one of the best research systems). To make the voice, which used my own recordings, I used the multisyn suite of tools for Festival. These details are just FYI, and not important to knowing how the system works.  

The state of the industry is unit selection synthesis; or in laymans' terms ""recording a lot of sound and cutting it up and rearranging it cleverly."" 

Here is how the state of the industry in speech synthesis (the tech behind Siri on iOS, and other voices) works: 

1) First, a professional voice talent goes into a recording studio and records many many hours of a script with the most generic intonation possible, one specially-scripted sentence at a time. This ensures that many repetitions of most of the needed sounds are captured. 

2) Then, the recordings are hand segmented into sentences and a model of the speech sounds in each is made using a restricted form of speech recognition. Using this model, each sentence is then assigned a sequence of single-sound-level labels.

3) The labels are used to cut the recordings into tiny single-sound pieces. There are multiple pieces or units for any given label, and the collection of all the units is the unit database.  

4) At synthesis time, the synthesis system calculates a ""cost"" of picking certain pieces. If I want to say ""Hi reddit"" I need to have the sequence of sounds [h, i, r, @, t^, i, t_cl, t]. The lowest ""cost"" is the best cost. The system looks at two subcosts, the target cost and the join cost, to calculate the cost of any sequence overall. 

The target is my sequence of needed sounds, determined by the system's text analysis mechanisms. The lowest target cost would be the exact sequence [h, i, r, @, t^, i, t_cl, t]. A worse cost would be [b, ii, r, @, t^, ih, t, z]. Target cost asks ""how much is the sound clip I am choosing like the one it's supposed to match in terms of what kind of sound it is?"" 

The other subcost is join cost, which is a measure of how much acoustic difference is between the units themselves. Is the pitch different? Is the shape of the sounds different at the edges? Is one sound much louder than the other? This is where my voice failed; there was SO much variation in pitch and loudness that there weren't enough GOOD units at the same level to move to the next sound imperceptibly. It is good to speak expressively in real life; it is bad to speak expressively when recording for a unit selection system. 

Recall, there are MULTIPLE units (pieces of sound) for EACH label in the target sequence. Finding the sequence of units that best matches the target AND joins together well is not easy to do because you have lots of possible sequences that could be the best one; the one that lowers the cost the most. Long story short, you use a dynamic programming strategy called the Viterbi algorithm, which looks at all the possible first sounds in the target, calculates all the costs of joining to all the next possible sounds, and picks ONLY the lowest cost one and chooses that. Then at the next step for the next target sound, it does the same thing, and ONLY picks the next lowest cost, and so on. 

4) Now that you have your best sound sequence possible from your unit database, cross-fade the sounds together and play them! Voila!

I really appreciate the feedback though, and that you took time to take the evaluation!! I love to tell people about the work I'm doing; I find it really interesting. ^_^",0,1366037620,null,0,false,0,c9flsvu,t3_1cbyuk,t1_c9flsvu,t1_c9f9fzx,null,1431550584,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"I've never understood BTL landlording.

You pay £150k cash for a small flat and charge £600pcm for rent.  Assuming permanent occupation and the rent being correctly paid, that's 150 000 / 600 which is 250 months.  250 months is nearly 21 years.  21 years before you make your money back... *what is the point*?

You'll have other charges, like landlord's insurance and an insurance policy on everything in the flat that's yours like some of the furnishings and fittings.  You might also have fees to pay if you're using a letting agency.  If the flat is mortgaged, how much would you have left from the rent each month after that's been paid along with everything else?

People say ""It gives us an income!"", but wouldn't you be better just keeping the original £150k and not spending it in the first place?  Again, I fail to see the point in going down the BTL road- the only way in which it might work is if the property was given to you for free, or you inherited it; maybe you're gambling on the price of the property increasing so you can flog it for a modest profit.

Moffat is running the show. 

Look at the credits to 702: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship: 

Episode Crew
Produced by
Steven Moffat	 ....	executive producer
Caroline Skinner	 ....	executive producer
Marcus Wilson	 ....	producer


This was not an episode written by Moffat but he is still the Executive Producer. He is the EP of the show and the showrunner. It has been stated in many interviews. He took over the position from Russell T Davies, notably one of the first people to be referred to as Showrunner within the BBC. (SOURCE- http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Head_writer).

That said, EP, Co-EP and Associate EP are all titles in name only. Generally the Line Producer is in charge of the financial end of productions. The ""writers"" are given EP, Co-EP, Associate EP and Producer credits. 

Caroline, I imagine, worked in a capacity similar to a line-producer, shouldering ever responsibility with the exception of creative development, which would fall to Moffat. (Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/doctor-who-caroline-skinner_n_2875668.html)

I speak with any authority on the matter because I work in American television as an EP's assistant.

What I'm getting at is that, by and large, his companions have been from the present (Classic Who's present being the 60's-80's)  At least in New-Who they don't go into the near future (The Rebel Flesh being the only example I can think of) they go into the far flung future.  The tech they are exposed to would radically change the present and change the way humanity  grows.  From what I've seen The Doctor is trying actively to keep humanity on it's own path and not really introduce elements of alien or future tech.  (Army of Ghosts/ The Long Game)

When Adam wanted to bring back all that juicy info for monetary gain, the Doctor was... less than pleased.  It's that kind of thing.  When Martha joked about recording Love's Labor's Won he gave her this look that said absolutely not.  Churchhill wanted the TARDIS to win WWII and The Doctor wouldn't let him have it  (Granted, he DID let him keep the Dalek cyborg who's name is escaping me right now)

In general I feel like the Doctor holds to keeping humanity on it's own path and not really giving them too much of a boost up.  Because he could have just revealed himself to them, given them all his knowledge and tech, and let them fly out among the stars so much sooner than they would without it.

true,TheQuangleWangleQuee,devon,The Shire,"Ah see this is the thing, I can completely understand why it is that some people liked her. We always go through our families and how they had been effected and so as I have said many times before, I can really see why some people thought she was great. However, it was different for different tiers of people. See, with builders, that is a relatively strong profession,as long as their are houses to be built. The problem with Thatcher was that she was encouraging council houses to be sold off, which worked out well for some people, but then again for those who couldn't afford to pay off their mortgages the houses got re-sold back to housing associations who continued to make money, continued to privatise, and therefore rent became a lot higher in the long run for those who couldn't initially afford the houses. The miners, the steel-workers etc who had completely lost all of their jobs, and then were offered no back up to this. I have always thought that people should come before profit, and that isn't particularly what Thatcher was doing, she was motivated by a declining economy (which wasn't even as bad as the recession we are in today) What should have been done was to sell the houses, but then build more and more council houses for those who couldn't get on the property ladder. Now we are in the situation where it has never been harder for a first time buyer to get their own house. People were compelled by her strength of character, and yet this backfired for a lot of people. If anything, the 'poor' man became completely worse off, because they were being forced further and further out of the new system of politics. I think there are probably a lot of reasons to like her, but her moral stance was atrocious, and I can't see why people would chose someone who would rather claim that the ANC were a terrorist organisation and would never rule south Africa, condoned a coup her son attempted in equatorial guinea,covered up Hillsborough for her own political gain and associated happily with some of the most notorious leaders at the time such as pinochet.

Not really. They could use any reason. And HADS is recurring for a long time. Deal with it.

- The claw scenes were utterly laughable and destroyed what suspense had been built up to that point. Were we supposed to take it that he would crush their heads or something. It gave the actors nothing to work with.

Do not agree, I think it was nice and good-tasted. But just opinions diverging here.

- The characters were totally one dimensional; the captain with the solemn responsibility, the ambitious first officer who'll betray them, the quirky professor type (""What about Duran Duran?! HAHAHA Im such a light-hearted character"").

They needed a lot of characters for this specific plotline. They did well with the story and the time they had in hands.

- They dug him out of the ice, some moron unfreezes him, and THEN he turns out to be the alien leader. Talk about serendipitous.

wtf It actually wouldn't matter that much if it were a Ice Warrior warlord or a general soldier. They just did it so they could add some - guess what - depth to the character, giving it some backstory.

- The Doctor and Clara just appear out of nowhere, heading for somewhere else again (this trick is getting REALLY tired now.)

And for the past 50 years, I suppose.

- and they pull the same old trick of the Tardis disappearing. If Gatiss can't be bothered to write stories around the Tardis then he shouldn't be involved with this show.

TARDIS has disappeared a thousand times in a thousand different circumstances. And for the sake of fiction, TARDIS is quite a - guess what again - deus ex machina. If it were around all the time, there would be hardly any problem for the Doctor to fix in more than 5 minutes.

- By far the worst of all, the alien was a martian. A BLOODY MARTIAN.

yeah c'mon gatiss why did you create the ice warriors like that
Oh, I'm sorry, IT WAS DONE IN 1967. Get a bloody TARDIS to complain with Hayles, as I_Am_The_Slime's said.

Why should you care about a family who never cared about yours? who watched Police beat down people protesting after she more than happily told them that she was taking away the only jobs they ever knew.

I don't feel sorry for her that she got thrown out of office. I don't feel bad that she had dementia, plenty of better people with such an illness would deserve my sympathy.

He usually puts reactions and emotions (but the Doctor's, of course) aside, unless they are useful for something. That's how it worked with Amy and Rory, and that's how it was working with Clara until this episode and the bodies in the room - that shocked her enough to not follow him.

Although I kinda miss this ""normal people doing extraordinary things"", I think Moffat's doing a nice job in his alley. If he could get some of that it would get very close to perfection.

And, regarding the ""far too familiar too quickly"", that's easily explainable: we don't know for how long they have been together. We saw hardly two years of Amy and Rory with the Doctor, though they were together, certainly, for at least 10 years. The same thing happens to Clara here. We see them trying to arrive at Vegas, but we don't know how long they have been together, and how much he has explained to her.

That wouldn't be a stop and search?

https://www.gov.uk/stopped-by-police-while-driving-your-rights/overview

&gt; The police can stop a vehicle for any reason. If they ask you to stop, you should always pull over. You’re breaking the law if you don’t.

&gt;If you’re stopped, the police can ask to see your:

&gt;driving licence

&gt;insurance certificate

&gt;MOT certificate

&gt;If you don’t have these documents with you, you have 7 days to take them to a police station. You’re breaking the law if you don’t show the requested documents within 7 days.

&gt;The police can also give you an on-the-spot fixed penalty notice for many minor offences and make you take a breath test in certain circumstances.

&gt;You can also have your vehicle seized if you’re stopped on suspicion of driving without insurance and for some other offences.

**Edit:** 

Getting closer to the answer I'm after, they can stop and question you at any time, just want to clear up the entire ""Am I being detained or am I free to go"" line being relevant to UK Law

&gt;Stop and question: police powers

&gt;A police officer has powers to stop you at any time and ask you:

&gt;what you’re doing

&gt;why you’re in an area and/or where you’re going

&gt;However, you don’t have to answer any questions the police officer asks you.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Lest people forget how the Liverpool Chairman (John Smith) tried to blame Chelsea fans for Heysel because he claimed he heard 'Southern accents'. There is an awful lot of bad blood that most of the newer supporters aren't even aware of

It angers and offends me that so little attention is paid to Heysel. 39 people (almost entirely Juventus fans) crushed to death due to Liverpool fans charging them and helping to cause a collapse. Liverpool fans always trot out the 'the stadium was decrepit and dangerous' line, which while true doesn't excuse the act nor does it account for the people crushed before the collapse itself. A dozen or so Liverpool fans charged with involuntary manslaughter, English teams banned from Europe for 5 years (partly due to pressure from Thatcher, that famous friend of football)

I only know one Juventus fan well, he was a teenager in 1985, who has mentioned numerous times how Juve and Chelsea shared a kind of bond in the aftermath, both feeling wronged by Liverpool trying to shift the blame. His account of the Champions League game between Liverpool and Juve some years ago is fascinating. Liverpool made an attempt at an apology, the response was simple... ""We will never forget, fuck you""

This is the kind of thing I want people to read up on, certain clubs have shared histories or crossed paths that will forever affect their relationship.

&gt;Surely, if addicts just ask the doctor for heroin, there would be more available? Heroin addiction could rise.

Nope. Doctors would only prescribe for people who were already addicts. 

This would mean that people who wanted to start using heroin would likely have to source it illegally, but they would find it much harder to get hold of because the illegal supply would have dried up.

&gt;Although heroin addicts still wont hold down jobs. So they'll still be dependant on benefits outside prison, due to their addiction that the government now facilitates.

Benefits are much cheaper than prison. And because a proportion of addicts will stop, some of them will start working and paying tax. 

&gt;Isn't methadone prescribed to addicts to ween them off heroin? I just don't agree that the state should support peoples addictions to hard drugs, such as smack.

Yes, and it doesn't work all that well for everyone. 

&gt;What about cocaine? Should that be prescribed by a doctor at a cost to the tax payer so people can enjoy their Saturday nights?

Probably not. Most cocaine users are well off. Legalise, tax and regulate it. ",0,1366047470,null,0,false,0,c9fpbn8,t3_1ccgxm,t1_c9fpbn8,t1_c9foh8p,null,1431548925,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"If I recall correctly from my uni days, when looking at assets you account for the rise in the value of the asset as well as the annual dividend or yield.

So if you paid £100,000 on a house:

Annual Return = ( £5,000[rent] + £5,000[market value increase] - £2,000[servicing, agency costs, legal costs] ) / £100,000

Annual Return = 8%

The unique advantages of owning a house vs other security:

*  able to 'rent seek'. Everyone needs a house. Extremely regulated and restricted new supply. If incomes go up, so does your return without adding any value yourself. This is a win win.

* historically have been resilient to long term price crashes. This is why banks don't mind loaning people tens of thousands of pounds, because if they have a house they always have something of *some* value.

The unique disadvantages of house vs other security:

* fucked in the case of a bubble or price crash. Property ownership sums only work long term, if you are looking to flip then you are in the speculation game, and could be setting yourself up for the worst year of your life.

* vulnerable to relaxed building regulation, or tenant protection law. Housing is a key factor people need to *live*, and understandably people are upset if you are fucking them. In theory, it only takes one angry mob to get the government to change the law to introduce an anti exploitation law. Though in practice most of the government are in the same property owning club, but its something to bear in mind. (Compare if you will to if there was a limited supply of water that you owned and the mob decided you were being a dick about it - the government would mandate you had to sell at a certain price that you might not be happy about.)",0,1366047760,null,0,false,0,c9fpfkh,t3_1cdsds,t1_c9fpfkh,t1_c9flsxy,null,1431548874,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

People take this to mean shes connected the Rose in some way. Never mind the rose in Asylum probably being a reference to Carmen which is the opera the music was from, The Rose and Crown being a genaric name for a pub, and lots of people having roses in their homes. Also the importent line from Hungry Like the Wolf probably being ""I am Lost I am found"" not the wolf part.

As for the helmet, you need to buy one that fits. Each helmet has a different internal shape so you need to try on several and get one that fits you. Personally it's the one area where I think spending a bit more would be worthwhile.

I'd also spend a bit more on some more protective gloves.

As for he bikes they're all fine for learning and commuting. Personally I'd get a Suzuki RV125 Van Van as it would be a lot more fun. I'm biased though (see my flair).

EDIT: Forgot to say, for the CBT find a school that doesn't charge extra if you don't complete it in one day. If you say where you are people may be able to recommend a school.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I'm 25 if you care (with a degree in finance), but honestly it is not cheap to build a house, and it's not going to get cheaper. Environmental concerns and NIMBYs will only make it more expensive. Look at the global trend for property, the general exception was the US which went completely nuts. Large companies with next to costless borrowing on huge landbanks of developable land will not sell to you at a 'market rate' because they set the market rate. They will sell to you at the rate that makes them a huge profit.

Houses in the UK are approximately 30% overvalued by a typical 'I can trade this for any other security in a costless, information-free manner'. But obviously if you can't afford to sell, you can't afford to sell.

We are in a bubble absolutely, but that doesn't mean the bubbling has to 'pop' tomorrow, or the day after. Look at Amazon, overpriced for about 8 years before it came back down to fair values.

I'm not going to advocate building castles in the sky, but at the same time most people will go broke betting against the property market if they're waiting for it to normalise.

See Japan and the Nordic countries, both offer interesting insights.

But there were people doing the pushing and shoving and the crushing, which seems to be forgotten. and they were liverpool fans. They make it look like the fans themselves could do nothing about it but they still piled into the stands and caused a crush.

I am not with Liverpool, and I never will be, I think it is a detestable club with a history of foul play, appauling fans who think they are more poetic and beautiful and lovelier that everyone else because they won a few championships when they could kill the game by passing back to the goalie.

But my heart is with those families outside of the footballing world, as more often than not, the people who die are not the ones who cause the trouble.

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"In terms of the bike I would go with an order of preference of Honda CG125 - Yamaha YBR - Suzuki EN125. I have to admit I'm slightly biased because I had an old Honda 125. Honda's are rock solid. Say whatever else about them you like but they're stupidly reliable. In terms of 125s other than reliability they're all much of a muchness. The handling is all fairly neutral and speed / acceleration doesn't really vary either. 

On the equipment front. I would budget more. Seriously. If the bike you get is mechanically sound and safe then it doesn't really matter too much how much it cost. It'll do the job. When it comes to kit, well that's where you may want to consider spending your mullah. Good kit is the difference between enjoying your ride and wanting to kick the bike into a pond and walk. 

I would look for a different helmet. All that is between your skull and the floor is your helmet, so you want a good one. Whilst it needs to fit you and be comfortable I would budget more here. Also if you go for a full face one rather than a flippy uppy one then you'll get more for your money (especially if you're going to spend under £200). It doesn't need to a be a shoei or arai to be a decent helmet but the fit and finish probably won't be as good and the fit and finish makes a fair difference to a helmet. If you've never ridden a bike you don't realise how much things like  wind noise, water getting into the helmet, comfort, ease of cleaning etc really makes a difference. I'd say save up a bit, get a more expensive helmet rather than buy a cheap one now that you'll want to throw away in three weeks. have a look on the sharp.gov.uk website which rates helmets above ECE, find a few you're interested in, then go to a shop and try them on. AGV, HJC, shark  all make helmets tend to be fairly good value for the money and have decent safety ratings. Also between those three you should find something that fits your head shape. Box helmets are bit more budget and that does show in the fit and finish but some of them do have good safety ratings. However a more expensive helmet will degrade less over time because it will be built from better materials. Make sure you try a helmet and find it comfortable before you commit to buying it. A good fit is important for both comfort and safety. A helmet can't do its job properly if it doesn't fit. Understand how a helmet should fit too. A lot of people try on a helmet that's too big for them and think its great. It should be tight. It should press on your cheeks, you shouldn't be able to easily move your head from side to side or up and down. A correctly fitting helmet can be surprisingly tight, but over time will be shaped by your features so it will fit like a glove. I really can't stress how important a good fit is enough so go to your local motorcycle shop and try on as many helmets as you can. 

The jacket and trousers should be reasonable although perhaps not the most water proof and again, the devil is in the detail with the fit and finish. However it should provide good protection but I would consider investing in a back protector. either one you wear like a back pack or one that fits in the jacket's back protector pocket.

Those should be some fairly decent boots that will do you year round. I personally prefer ones that are a bit taller but that's more of a personal thing than anything. 

Gloves, you may want to consider spending a bit more here. You don't have to go crazy. You don't need carbon fibre knuckle, leather from a rare breed of cow's backside,  all singing all dancing, Italian manufacturer gloves. At the same time, you do want some decent gloves. They really do make all the difference. If you come off, you will put your hands out to try and save yourself (natural reaction, you do it when you fall over). Also when you're riding you drive with your hands a lot more than in a car. You have the clutch, throttle, front brake, indicator, lights, everything is in your hands except the gear stick and the rear brake so decent gloves are worth the investment. You want pair that allow a reasonable amount of dexeterity that are made from solid materials. Leather palm at least if not the whole glove, knuckle armour (seriously, a stone to the knuckle, not nice, road crap has a habit of finding things like eyes and knuckles), good fastenings at the wrist are a must. Held makes some really nice gloves. Personally I have about 8 or 9 pairs of gloves. Admittedly I've been riding for years now and I have a problem when it comes to trying not to purchase new bits of bike kit but gloves are important. 

Yeah, you've over budgeted a bit there on the MOT and tax. However be aware of things like tyres, oil, sprockets and final drive chain etc. If you buy a bike where the consumables are worn down you'll only end up replacing them so if you have to spend a bit more to get a bike in which those things have more life in them you'll probably end up saving money. 

Edit. I notice you haven't budgeted for security. Motorcycles are rather prone to being nicked unfortunately. You're about twice as likely to get it pinched as you are a car. The extra bad news is 125cc get targeted a lot because they're popular. Be careful when buying. A good chain and padlock are a must. A lot of chains are useless, you want something which is nice and chunky, something like an almax. A disc lock (especially ones with a built in alarm) are good too. things like smartwater are great and don't cost much. A lock, chain and decent anchor point are the only thing that will stop someone loading it into a van.

If the FA could retroactively do something about something like this, why would foy even give a shit about getting his calls right? It disenfranchises and lowers the referees standards.

2- retroactive action would set a dangerous precedent. The FA allowing themselves to go back and deal out cards would give every club in the league legal precedent to petition the FA to review every single call a team would deem ""unfair."" This would mire the game in a huge bureaucratic mess where the handful of bad calls in EVERY game would need to be reviewed.

When I started biking I just had a helmet and that was it, rode around in trainers and t shirts. How I never seriously hurt myself I don't know. Its not to be advised. I've seen people who have come off not wearing gear who look like they've slid down a cheese grater.

On the CG, it does make some difference yes. I'd say though, if its a post 2000 then you'll be fine. Before 2000 they're kickstart only rather than electric start (from 2000 to 2003 they've got both) and they were front drum brake rather than front disc brake.  Drum brakes don't stop quite so well as disc brakes. In terms of fuel gauges, all fuel gauges are cack. Especially on motorcycles. About as much use as a steak house at a vegetarian conference.  Trust in the mileage reading. Plus the CG has a reserve on its fuel tap. Your fuel tap or petcock to give it its more proper name, will have different positions and you'll normally have an on, off and reserve. The reserve setting is fed by a pipe which is lower down in the fuel tank than the one in on position. So if you're petcock is in the on position, you run out, you can switch over to reserve and you've usually got about another 50 miles on reserve. When you do fill up remember to switch it back to on, or the next time you run out, you really will run out. That said running out and having to push the thing to the petrol station is practically a rite of passage.

When referring to minimum wage alone, people will be getting **less** value for their ""increased"" currency amount.

Money is a currency. The amount (ie the number itself) of that currency holds no bearing on what value each lowest factor (ie a penny) actually represents and bestows. For example, $1 does not equal £1. The number shows how many pennies or pounds you have, not the value of those pounds and pence.

So, while the amount of pounds and pence you get from minimum wage has increased, the actual value will be less than before the additional 12p, due to inflation.

This means that while the amount of currency you earn has went up, the actual value (the entire reason for currency to exist) has decreased. The 12p increase results in a cut to what value you were receiving previously.

The number (for example £5 or 50p) is just an arbitrary number that is representative of the actual value. If the value it represents goes down and subsequently reduces the buying power in comparison, what you can gain from your currency has been cut. It has been decreased. It has been made less. It has been reduced.

How is this not a simple concept to understand?

The full line he said was ‘I agree…about the extremities of pay and the fact much of it is grossly insensitive and downright immoral.’

He also said:

‘I think it’s mad that the members of the boy band New Direction made £5million each last year. I think it’s crazy that many of the footballers are routinely paid £10m a year to pay football.

‘I don’t believe it’s the Government’s job to stop that. I also don’t think it’s any of my business.

‘But I do believe it is shareholders jobs to stop counterproductive excesses in their companies. Shareholders should exercise their responsibilities over companies.’

First, people aren't forgetting anything, they're acknowledging the situation.

This is what we've been fighting the the last however many years, and what finally came to light quite recently. **The supporters who died were not to blame.**

For more info, I highly recommend you you check out the /r/soccer thread about Hillsborough on the front page. There is a first had account in the comments, as well as plenty of discussion about what exactly happened: http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1cdpk6/24_years_ago_96_people_went_to_a_football_game/c9fjihv

This is also a good diagram of what happened: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7992845.stm

There has been plenty of external examination into what exactly happened (as I'm sure you've heard)--and they've determined that not only was there a police cover up but also the fans present were *not* to blame. 

I get you dislike Liverpool. I get that you feel bad for the 96 who died. But when you say ""What else would they be if they didn't absolve themselves of all blame and tell everyone"", that's just hateful.

For well over one hundred years at common law. [Here's a decent summary on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchoate_offences_in_English_law). Arresting somebody who hasn't actually committed a crime is fundamental to a huge number of police practices - otherwise police would be unable to act to act pre-emptively on, for example, bomb plots.

In this instance, the question is about the quality of police intelligence and the severity of the potential crime. Based on a balancing of those factors, the police action may be unreasonable.

They're necessary to allow police to prevent many serious crimes and [they've existed for a long time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchoate_offences_in_English_law) - attempted murder or conspiracy to defraud are both arrestable offences, for example, as they should be.

The potential issue here is that the police appear to be acting to prevent a relatively minor crime and on relatively meagre evidence. However, it's not an absolute question but one of degree. The clarity of the issues isn't helped by people like Ken talking about Orwellian thought crime (which makes it sound absolute).

How justifiable this action is depends on what level of violence the police anticipate and how good their evidence for that is. If, for example, a number of people have been planning to arm themselves then it's quite right that they be detained. A more grey area would be if they're planning to jump in front of the hearse - there would be potential for huge disruption and possible danger. If they're planning to wave some placards in a designated protest zone then there's obviously no way they should be held in custody.

I'm very uneasy about this, particularly if it becomes the new norm, but I don't think we have enough information to say that pre-emptive arrests would not be justified.

It's quite simple, if we really feel the need to force people into full time work, find them a full time, paying job.  We don't need to because there's quite enough people unemployed to fill them all, it's skills and training that's lacking, and of course, the unemployed can't afford it, and the companies don't want to invest in people any more.

Same goes for the bedroom tax, it's a reasonable idea, if only there were enough smaller places to move to, as it is, it's just another sneaky way to pay the poorest less than they need to get by and blame them for it happening.

Just as building factories and homes costs a lot and produces no revenue until finished, young recruits are a drain on resources and contribute little while they're being trained. Sure, the potential benefits after a few years are great (as with new infrastructure), but what if the economy slumps again? Or what if government policy changes and all your workers end up in another sector or working for a competitor? The economy may be recovering (if slowly), but it is in a state of great flux and great uncertainty, and people don't like making long term commitments in such an environment. 

On the government's part, pumping money into the economy won't necessarily help, and may hinder investment. Why would a company invest now if the government might give them a subsidy to do the same thing next year? Who's going to make a 10 year commitment on the basis of government money that might dry up after 2? Many large businesses are sitting on vast piles of cash at the moment, but so far seem unwilling to do much with it until they can be more certain of making acceptable returns.

They're not particularly easy to understand, and they often result in 'thought crimes' - crimes where what you think creates the offence, and your actions are only used to convince the jury of what you were thinking. So, essentially, it is criminal to plan/intend/try etc to commit a crime - and on that basis we absolutely *can* arrest people if we think they're going to commit a full crime (and in many other circumstances).

The requirement for most of these offences is, understandably, fairly high (not least because the maximum sentence is typically the same as if you actually had committed the full crime in question).

true,KarmaUK,null,null,"Well, this is part of why there was uproar about the Tories' retroactively changing the law to avoid paying back jobseeker's money they'd been conned out of.

If you've heard the name Cait Reilly, essentially she was volunteering at a local museum, it being relevant to her degree, and the work she wanted to get into, and she was 'advised' at the JobCentre she'd have to stop volunteering because Poundland wanted her for a workfare placement.  She refused, on the basis that she's already volunteering somewhere that would aid her search for work, and lost her benefits.

What's riling me a fair amount is the current system's dislike of anyone who volunteers, goes looking for extra education, training or does anything to help themselves outside of directly just constantly applying for jobs.  There seems to be a grudging acceptance of volunteer work, training and education in the style of ""Well, I suppose you can do a bit of that...IF you fill out this form, AND make sure it's not more than a few hours a week, AND if we think it might have possibly got in the way of a potential job that we imagined, then we get to kick you off benefits!""

Essentially they'd been told it was mandatory when it wasn't, and it's very selectively voluntary, it's very easy to say or sign the wrong thing and find out you've agreed to something, or be pressured into it.

It's not 'mandatory' so long as you don't need your benefits to live on, basically.

The daft thing being, if we're being so lazy and there's jobs out there, just put us in the jobs, don't create unpaid placements for us, let us bloody work for pay!  If we then don't perform to standards expected by an employer, they can fire us, and we'll lose the job and our benefits.

Or, put us on useful training schemes while we're on benefits, and just cover the travel and expenses, and we'll do that.  Just don't put us in Poundland and expect people to believe we need to be there for six week's full time, for 'training', when so many reports have come back saying they're just giving all the shitty work to do because they're not even needed, but they've been taken cos it's free labour.

I'd like to break into IT, put me in the tech support dept taking calls for a couple of weeks for no pay, while I'm on benefits if you like, let me prove I can do it, so long as if I'm not taken on, I can take away a statement saying I'm capable, and a reference to take to the next job.  Don't put me in Tesco for six weeks then quickly print out a shoddy A4 'certificate' saying I've completed my training course in trolley pushing and floor mopping.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not above doing those jobs. I'm above doing those jobs for no pay.  I'm not above doing something that will actively improve my career prospects for no pay, however.

I realise this is the very essence of TL;DR, but I just feel the current system isn't helping anyone to find long term, fulfilling work, and as has been the case for decades, is an effort to make the figures look smaller at the expense of the actual people involved, including the staff at the Jobcentres, some of whom really want to help, and are hamstrung.",0,1366068408,null,0,1366069139,0,c9fx2i9,t3_1ceri4,t1_c9fx2i9,t1_c9fwzv3,null,1431545203,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

Donna would never have allowed the slaughter of the Silence, Rose would never have formed the plan 'let's grab a gun and force a silurian to help us through blackmail or violence' as her first, instinctual resort if she found herself in Amy's place in *The Hungry Earth*. 

But anyway, yeah - you are not alone (I was gonna just put 'you're not alone' but what a missed opportunity that would have been...), in fact I think you might be me. Also, I too am optimistic about Clara - rest assured she's just as touching, adventurous, brave and compassionate in Cold War - without wishing to give too much away (I'll spoiler tag it just in case, but I haven't gone into detail) [this scene where...] (#s she's talking with the old friendly guy after the thing she's found traumatic has just happened) really touched me.",0,1366074865,null,0,false,0,c9fzfkq,t3_1cfazp,t1_c9fzfkq,t3_1cfazp,null,1431544017,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

For some reason, it seems it's always the fans that started watching with the relaunch that hate on Amy.  I'm not sure why that is.  Amy is definitely a ""classic"" companion in the sense that she's there as a proxy for the audience.  A modern-day human who can point at things and ask ""what's that, Doctor?""  Some companions have been more ""colorful"" in various ways, but the really weird ones (Leela, Turlough, Mel) don't really serve the story as well has having somebody who is relatively ""normal"" whose eyes the story is being told through.

And not every companion has to be particularly smart or otherwise exceptional.  They provide the Doctor with a moral compass (which he sometimes lacks rather severely), and anything else they do to help him is just bonus.

Amy was impressively brave and a bit of a thrill-seeker.  Where some companions (Rose, Donna) hopped on to the TARDIS because they were unhappy with their lives, Amy genuinely craved the adventure for its own sake.  She was living her childhood fantasy.  An extended night-before-the-wedding party.

She also had one of the more interesting back-stories of any companion to date, a back-story that ended up getting re-written multiple times due to ""the crack"", The Doctor, and several other events she ran into while traveling with him.

And let's not forget that she made more than her share of noble sacrifices along the way, her last being the decision to say goodbye to her best friend forever to ""die"" with her husband.

Plus, it doesn't hurt that she's stunningly good looking.  That hair was amazing.

I love Clara, and I'm really looking forward to seeing the Doctor puzzle out just what her deal is, and my favorite companion will probably always be Romana, but Amy is near the top of my all-tiime list.

(Disclaimer:  If I had been watching the series via BBC-America and subjected to all those voice-over teasers that everybody found so annoying, maybe my position would be different.

Of course, she should have just bitten the bullet and broke up with him directly.  Thankfully, I think things turned out better for them both because she left him.  I don't think he would have ever progressed so much as a person had she not.  

However, I also agree with the comment that there is a big different between leaving your boyfriend and leaving your fiance on your wedding night.  I mean, when you think of it, even before the Doctor reappeared in her life, Rory had been through a lot with her.  He had been her friend through childhood, which means he stuck by her when everyone thought she was crazy due to her obsession.  So already, he's pretty awesome and not deserving of her desire to escape him.

Which means that she really shouldn't have been marrying Rory that day in the first place, if she was having a lot of second thoughts.  For me, it's just another example of her putting herself before anyone else.  

I agree that Rose handled things with Mickey badly.  Probably her biggest flaw as a character in my book.  She should have broken up with him as soon as she realized that she didn't want anything outside of the Doctor (which didn't take long).  However, her mistake was made out of love for Mickey.  She didn't want to hurt him and thus dragged it out way too long.  Not saying she was right, just that her heart was in the right place.

So far as Clara goes, she does stick pretty well inside the ""pretty but brilliant girl"" trope that they have going, but I like the mystery around her, and though I can't put my finger on it, there is something about how she feels about her parents, and the way she talked to Mary in ""Rings"" that really makes me like her.  Also that she didn't freak out when she lost track of the Doctor, even though it was her first time on an alien planet.  

Just going to put this out there as well: there should be a dude companion.  And I mean, a solitary dude, not just a guy that is there because of their girlfriend/wife (much as I loved Rory).  It almost always ends up being a romantic debacle, and I could do without that (provided he was a straight dude).  I have kind of always wished they would bring back Adam Mitchell from the episodes ""Dalek"" and ""The Long Game"" (the guy whose forehead opens up at a snap).

First, I'd like to say that I feel terrible for the people who died that day and their families.  No one should ever die at a football match. 

Having said that, it's not mutually exclusive to feel bad for the victims and still feel disdain for present day Liverpool fans. They're the worst.  364 days of the year, they act like they're better than every fan base out there, let alone us, whom they regard as plastic scum.  Then, one day a year, they demand solidarity from the entire English footballing world and act holier than thou to any club that doesn't properly commemorate their tragedy that, by the way, now transcends fandom and is the tragedy of every football fan. 

Then, of course, there is the Heysel disaster and everything that happened there, which EnglishMD already did a good job summarizing (seriously, read LFCs official take on it here: http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/heysel. It's about as whitewashed history as it gets especially about the reaction of Juventus fans which is pretty much the opposite of what happened).

true,AncientSummoner,k9,K-9,"For me, it is different.
Rose: I loved her because she was spunky and energetic. Her love for the Doctor is real and deep. What I don't like about Rose is how almost every Whovian loves her and wants her back. I don't. I think her time is done. It was well spent and proved to be epic and unique. Let it be and and stop comparing new Companions to her.

Martha.....Martha, Martha, Martha....I don't hate Martha, I hate what the writers did to her. Martha had the potential to be one of the most independent, smart, resourceful....but they threw that out the window after episode one and focused more on the rebound, teenage love aspect. ""He doesn't love me, rose this, rose that. Why can't he see me, that I am in love with him? O woe is me, woe is me."" I hated it so much. I wanted so much to love Martha because she was the exact opposite of Rose and I wanted that to shine! But nope, had to go with the rebound. Poor Martha, she will never get to shine as brightly as she should have.

Donna, now Donna is, in my honest opinion, THE best Companion the Doctor has had in a very long time. She was witty, daring, smart, and so very human. She didn't LOVE the Doctor. She wasn't all fangirl over him. She was a true Companion in every sense of the word. Donna saved the Doctor from himself, from becoming heartless and angry. She will forever be the best Companion and I will miss her so much. I am sad over her ending because it leaves little to no room for a comeback.

Amy became a combination of Rose and Martha. Loves the Doctor, is hurt he can't SEE it. She isn't entirely useful but she was willing to do anything for the Doctor, to help him. People don't like how she was willing to ditch Rory on the night before her wedding, but what people seem to forget is that weddings are scary as hell. The sudden realization that you are about to be fully committed to another human being....it doesn't mean you do not love them, it just means you are afraid you aren't as ready as you thought you were. This is a very human reaction and that is why Amy was a good companion. She's human, resourceful and quick witted. 

I can't say much on Clara yet. I do like her, though.

Now for the other Companions. I'll be brief.
Mickey - hated him, sorry Mickey fans, I just didn't like him at all, so annoying and whiny.
Jack: Loved him, wanted to see more of him (literally, damn you cameras....could have aimed lower....)
Rory: I hated him at first then I loved him, it's weird. He is the only companion to have done that to me. I thought he was going to be useless, the whiny guy like Mickey. But no....no he wasn't. He became a fully fledged Companion in his own right and kicked ass doing so. ",0,1366083764,null,0,false,0,c9g2rm5,t3_1cfazp,t1_c9g2rm5,t3_1cfazp,null,1431542446,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Someone intended to be perceived as primitive by our standards paired with someone obviously superior.  Honestly, I think Leela is far more representative of how a contemporary person would act in that sort of a fish-out-of-water scenario.

I get your point about the companion's role being a proxy for the audience, but I'm not sure I necessarily agree.  A good companion should be integral to the story, not just a conduit.  The relationship between the doctor and his companion should help shape the doctor and make him more interesting, otherwise the companions just become generic.  The wider the gap between ""normal"" and not often leads to perceptions of those companions being either the worst, or the best.  It's probably testament to the strength of the franchise that everyone can view the same characters so differently.

As for Amy, I think I would have preferred Amy as a companion, or Rory as a companion, but I don't think I really like Amy with Rory as a companion.

Then again, I'm very forgiving of flawed yet good characters when I can understand the reasons they make the mistakes they do.  And with Amy, I totally sympathize.  I really enjoyed watching her character go from the girl who ran off the night before her wedding to go on adventures into the woman who gave up any and all future adventures forever to be with Rory.  She wasn't perfect; she messed up.  She shouldn't have tried to sleep with the Doctor the night before her wedding, but I get why she goes for it.  She reacts emotionally to things, and that means she doesn't make the right choices all the time.  And I'm okay with that.

I also love the way her relationship with Rory develops.  They're two people who are so in love with the other and yet neither believes that the other could possibly love them that much in return.  Rory thinks Amy's in love with the Doctor long after she realized that Rory was the one for her, and Amy tries to push Rory away because she thinks he'd be happier if he found someone else who could have kids with him.  But eventually, somehow, they finally both accept each other's love, and it's wonderful.

I can't speak to your literary taste, I was merely making a suggestion based on the fact my comment 
&gt; is the weirdest thing [you] have ever read.

Also, I don't see how you could possibly construe *me* as the ""asshole"" here. I'm doing very little different from you.

You're asking if there are any single, available ladies who'll be coming along so you can try and get your end in.
I'm asking you if you're coming along to see if I could get my end in. Not so much different about that. You can't turn round and blame a guy for trying when there's supposed to be a ""young, good looking and promiscuous(and confident)"" fella around. 

Although, if I am doing one thing better than you I'm adding a bit of the personal touch by asking you directly if you're interested or not; instead of just carpet bombing the community and hoping for a hit.

So really, I don't see how I'm an asshole just because I'm asking you if you'd be interested in ""the sex"". Either we're both assholes, or neither of us are. Talk about double standards. Is it that you hate gay people, or is it that you've never been with a man?

If you won't have access to a car or a motorist friend who also likes zoos, go to London Zoo instead. Take the train to Paddington and then go by Tube (if you're under 26, you can get a card that gives you a 1/3 discount on almost all rail travel in the UK).

By the way, Oxford University doesn't have a campus, it just owns a sizable proportion of the buildings in the city centre. A lot of people arrive in Oxford, try to get directions ""to the University"", and get entirely lost - find out where you're actually going first.

true,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,"It's a bit of a complicated issue really. As we are now acutely aware due to the placebo effect, your mental health and your belief in the treatment you are being provided plays a massive role in your recovery. With this in mind, it is often the case that doctors find themselves in a position where they are unable to diagnose a cause for a reported illness (either because the cause is unknown or because there isn't really anything wrong in the first place), and in these circumstances it can often be beneficial for doctors to have the ability to proscribe treatment for treatment's sake. 

The NHS, as a health service provider, needs to weigh up the cost of leaving a person untreated and likely to return, taking up more time and resources, against the cost of proscribing homeopathic treatment and essentially allowing the patient's improved mental state to be the real cure.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; And where is this? Oxford providing you shine the Don's shoes? I've got a friend in ""postdoc"" at St Andrews. He earns £21k.

First, you've just demonstrated you haven't a clue what you're talking about.  A postdoc at Oxford on a (say) EPSRC-funded project is likely earning a very similar wage to a postdoc in Strathclyde on an EPSRC-funded project.  Salary is not commensurate with the prestige of the university when it comes to research council funded positions, it's almost standardised (up to whatever the project authors can get past the referees) across funding bodies.  Further, non-research council funded positions at the likes of Oxford and Cambridge typically pay **under** the odds, as their fellowships also include bed and board.  Keep pretending you do have a clue, however.  I'm sure second-hand knowledge passed on from your ""friend"" will get you through this debate.

Second, it's my second postdoc, if I was a senior RA I'd be earning more.  I was earning exactly the same elsewhere, under a different funding body (EU's FP7 framework --- actually slightly less now I think about it due to €/£ differences).  My girlfriend would also be earning the same in her field if she pursued a postdoc, again under a different funding body (in her case the BBSRC).  I'm familiar with expected postdoc salaries of at least four funding bodies (EPSRC, BBSRC, NERC, and EU's FP7, I'm also subscribed to two German academic jobs mailing lists, an American one and a general one covering my research area --- and guess what, they all agree with me, not *you*), and mid-£30k seems about right for all of them.  Your friend's salary isn't typical for a postdoc salary in the physical, mathematical, biomedical or clinical sciences (who pay more again still, as these postdocs will typically have a PhD and a medical degree), at least those funded by the typical research councils or supranational bodies like funding through the EU's FP7 programme.  Sorry they got fucked over with a shitty salary, but that's their problem (of course, there's every chance that they're not really a postdoc at all, but a research fellow, who chose to sacrifice salary for the prestige of getting a competitive fellowship).

&gt; Chances are your University Principal is earning 10x that for fewer hours while doing no teaching or research, most students locked in a broken lift with him wouldn't recognise him.

Doubtful.  He may be earning more than me, but he probably works longer hours and has less holiday.

&gt; The University Court laugh at life of the mind jobsworths like you. You are a meal ticket for them.

Who gives a shit?  I'm in my job because I enjoy it, and it's got flexible working conditions.  If I wanted to leave for industry and better pay, I would.

Further, as for ""crowing"", I'm doing nothing of the sort.  I'm simply stating that the circlejerk that *you* were a party to about the poor salaries of academics is completely laughable.

I put up with the moments up manic OTT crap because they throw the moments of pathos into sharper contrast, and every so often they just plain work in their own right.

true,gtpm28,null,null,"I think a lot of it is just her and Rory's character arcs - they have to be a rubbish in the beginning so they can grow into better characters. 

When we first meet them, Amy obviously still really immature - she keeps all her childhood toys and lives in her childhood home, she's working as a kissogram when she has the capacity to be an author (and possibly a perfume designer), and we see in Amy's Choice that she thinks married life with Rory is going to be really boring. She's just not ready to be married - and this culminates with her trying to shag the Doctor (also I really don't think she was ""in love"" with him - she really explicitly states that it's not about that) - she wants to have a fling with someone exciting and strange before, as she sees it, she ""settles down"" into a boring life. And as the 5th series progresses, she's forced to grow up a bit - and really get to understand Rory and her feelings about him better.

Rory basically needed to toughen up a bit - because when we first meet him, he's nice, but everyone walks all over or just ignores him - Amy, his boss, the Doctor. If he married Amy when we first meet him, it wouldn't really be a marriage of equals. He turns into a much more confident character as the series progresses. I mean yeah, Amy can still boss him around - but you get the feeling that he could boss her back if he wanted to.

As regards the divorce stuff - I think it was a combination of the writers wanting a big start to the season and trying to force the characters to have conversations they couldn't have normally have. I also think Rory comes off really badly in that as well - the whole ""I love you more than you love me"" is just Rory being a prick. But at the same time - it's conversations the characters needed to have - after that point, their romance arc is pretty much done - and they've more or less reached their full maturity as characters.

Last week it was a full 10 degrees hotter in neighbouring Phnom Penh, so it's not as bad as it could be!  The hot season (late Feb to May-ish) does push us Northern temperate types to our limits though, it takes years for your body to really learn to cope (for the first few years my skin revolted quite revoltingly), and I'd be up in the hills or on the coast if I could afford the time away from the city.  The humidity makes it feel many degrees hotter.  It obviously helps not to be doing anything very physical.  Anyone who labours physically in this place has my total sympathy, if I manage to do one major physical task or journey in the heat of the day I'm very proud.  Of course, you adjust, you sleep through the hot hours, and do most stuff at dawn and dusk.  

Having said that though, it's only for these few months, the rest of the year is pretty pleasant once you've got used to it, especially the cool season from Sept. - Feb, once the rains have stopped, and the rains are a welcome relief which really are more enjoyable than annoying most of the time (short, heavy and predictable).

&gt;Does sound pretty amazing smelling the stuff being fermented though. One of those things that makes Britain seem very...unalive.

One thing you could never accuse Vietnam of being currently.  It'll change when everybody has their car (assuming global warming and/or peak oil don't put paid to that), but up until recent years, the fact that most everyone was riding push or motorbikes made the city very interactive and human, as does the crowding and the general lack of any sense of personal space or privacy (a very mixed blessing, but it has it's good, community enhancing side).  I mean, obviously the complete lack of zoning is another mixed blessing.  Anyone can open any old business unless it generates complaints, and that means a lot of small scale pollution and sometimes danger, but it adds to the sense of ""bustle"" - they're steadily being driven out by the chains and multinationals though sadly.",0,1366109647,null,0,false,0,c9g7pih,t3_1cbk38,t1_c9g7pih,t1_c9g6t02,null,1431540046,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

By that standing therefore, there is a significant difference in inflation rates between before and after Thatcher took power. This is likely attributable to her policies.

Just looking at the graph you can see the results clearly as well, the 70's were rife with high inflation, unlike the 1980s. Whilst it did fluctuate to points equal with the 70s, they were the highpoints of the 80s and the low points of the 70s. 

Comparing single points in time such as when she arrived and left is futile, considering how much inflation varies.

&gt; 

&gt; Vince Cable today accused many firms of not paying apprentices the minimum wage for their work as he lifted it to £2.68 an hour.

&gt; The Business Secretary also moved to “name and shame” companies breaking National Minimum Wage laws. But he stopped short of backing the “living wage” for London of £8.55 an hour, amid fears it could push up unemployment.

&gt; He admitted globalisation appeared to have pushed down wages of low-paid workers while allowing bankers, footballers, top managers and entertainers to earn huge sums. In a speech to the Institute of Directors, Mr Cable also said average wages have fallen by around 10 per cent since 2009 and unemployment could rise in coming months.

&gt; The Low Pay Commission recommended the minimum wage for apprentices should be frozen, but Mr Cable  instead opted today to increase it by 3p an hour.

Also, you can give people a placebo, and tell them it's a placebo, that it has no active elements - and it will still have an effect.

Therefore, it is _not_ trivial that homeopathy pills will have the same effect as any other placebo - despite them all having no active ingredients.

As I recall he was given a child's life sentence, or ""at HM's pleasure"" or ""until he was considered safe to society"" and at the time of sentencing it was expected that he'd be eligible for parole after about 10 years. After this 10 years or so a ""hard on crime"" home secretary got in and, after a few years of rejected parole applications, he was told he could forget release for the duration of that government. So another few years of this and he's got a reputation for not handling this disappointment like a model prisoner should.

He was released in the last year or two, but at one time he had a Phd lined up and the parole board declined an easing-back-into-society release schedule because they said he hadn't demonstrated that he was making steps to rehabilitated himself. And he was like, ""well, I got my O-levels, in prison, I got my A-levels, I'm really proud of myself, because this is big progress from the kid wot got locked away; so I got myself a degree [might have been 2, even] and I got myself on a Phd program. what do you want me to do to demonstrate that I'm bettering myself?""

This is all just from memory, mind. Look it up for yourself and you'll get a more accurate picture, but the blog posts I read made a personal impression on me of how broken and dysfunctional the prison rehabilitation system is.

You might say ""oh, well, he was in so long because he 'handled his parole disappointments badly'"" and you might accuse me of glossing over that, but I have the impression he was better behaved than than many inmates. Not only that, but I think it's pretty understandable to handle things badly when you're facing the promise of another 10 years inside, especially when you've already spend half your life behind bars, being told ""you'll be out by the time you're 25 or 30, mate"".

I imagine with your example of the milling machine, that the advent of the more modern machines have removed the need for thousands of manual jobs, but in turn have only required several hundred new jobs in the machine-manufacture / software / service maintenance industries.

It makes me wonder if we're bound on a course to a future where having a job at all becomes rarer and rarer.  And building and taking care of the machine automation is performed by a smaller and smaller set of employed people.  I suppose the best you could hope for in that case is for the 'employed class' to become more and more lazy and require ever more low skilled workers to do jobs around their home (an area machines aren't terribly good at).  Either that or the low skilled masses demand the government subsidise jobs for them that otherwise wouldn't exist.

true,whereisnsfw,null,null,"Not really all that easy to explain but I'll have a go:

1. With reference to the government we are operating on what is known as a budget deficit. That means that more is being spent by the government than it is collecting via tax revenue. This means that year on year we are having to borrow more and more money. This is a problem because it means that a greater proportion of our total earnings is spent on interest payments for our national debt. 

2. The UK economy as a whole is experiencing a period of near stagnation; we are not growing as an economy. Growth is important for many reasons for example employment. If you are running a business and you don't think that you will see growth for the next year, you won't employ anyone new. This brings me onto my next point. 

3. Confidence. There is low confidence in the world economy in general. People are not sure what is going to be occurring in the next few years for example the fall of a eurozone country. This is important because if people are not confident then, just like our business owner in point 2, they won't invest their money. This means we don't see any growth in our economy. 

4. Low interest rates are present at the moment in an effort to increase demand in the economy, primarily via consumption of goods and services. Low interest rates mean that people with existing debts will see their monthly payments fall (assuming they have a floating rate mortgage/loan) which means they have more disposable income to spend buying things in the shop which in turn boosts our economy. It also means that those wishing to borrow money to purchase something new will be able to do so for less. The problem is with low interest rates is that people are less willing to invest their money in the UK which reduces demand for our currency. This means that the value of the pound falls as it has done for the past 4 years. Before the collapse in 2008 we had a $2 pound (£1 = $2). Now it is around £1 = $1.50. This is not good news for us since we import so many of our goods, what with us being a small island and all. However it does mean that companies that export will see their produce appearing artificially cheaper on an international basis. 

That is a brief introduction as to what is going on at the moment. There are further issues such as banks not lending to small businesses and also the issue of quantitative easing however you can look those up if you wish to do so. 

TL;DR The economy isn't growing. We have debt. That sucks. ",0,1366120749,null,0,false,0,c9g9sks,t3_1cgj02,t1_c9g9sks,t3_1cgj02,null,1431539064,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,timbstoke,null,null,"For starters, have the employer cover the cost of any benefits the worker is receiving during their experience. You've immediately saved millions and silenced the ""taxpayer subsidising private businesses"" argument. 

Second, give the worker some kind of increase in their benefits while they're there. After all, you're taking away 8 hours a day that they should be using for Job Seeking - what they're getting during that time shouldn't be called Job Seekers Allowance. It doesn't have to be a huge increase, but it's inherently wrong that they're getting nothing in return for their time and effort. 

Third, require that companies participating in the scheme show evidence that some actual training that serves a function in the workplace is being provided. If the only roles available are unskilled labour, then you're not creating jobs, you're reducing them by allowing paid employees to be replaced with ~~employees~~ workers on benefits. (Edit: employee implies pay, and rights)

Fourth, keep tabs on the progress of both claimants going through the system, and businesses taking part. Ensure that businesses are only entitled to have a certain percentage of the workforce provided by the scheme. That limits the scope for legitimate jobs being replaced by workfare positions. Remove companies from the scheme who consistently fail to hire any of the people they are training. 

Finally, remove the mandatory aspect. Right now, you don't have to enter workfare (although the jobcentre staff will try very hard to hide that from you) but once you're in, you can't leave without the risk of losing your benefits. That's just asking for workers to be abused, because employers KNOW they can't fight back without being left destitute. 

Now not all of those suggestions will play nicely together. For example, if you're going to insist that the company provides training for a skilled role, then you can't simultaneously insist on minimum numbers of employees being taken on at the end of the training, because the more skilled the training, the higher the percentage of candidates who simply won't make the grade.

true,dearbluey,null,null,"Well, I'll try and address some of your points.

1) ""He tries too hard....always overacts..."" - It might seem that way at times, and I understand why you'd think that.  David Tennant has a big theatre background, and actors who come from theatre tend toward bigger gestures, bigger face-pulls, bigger and more flamboyant actions.  Because, you know, they're on a stage and people farther away need to see them.  That being said, the Doctor is a role that this can definitely work for.

2) ""He lets Rose get away with dumb stuff....Rose is always in trouble...gets him killed and he forgives her...."" - The alternative to this would be to restrict the actions of his companion(s) to such a degree that they are virtual prisoners.  He lets them do things because he is not their god, not their dictator.  Take away enough freedom of choice and you don't have a companion anymore...you have a slave.  Also, when did Rose kill the Doctor?  When he regenerated from Eccleston to Tennant, it was because he chose to save Rose from dying herself.  He made that choice, because he cared about her.  She didn't kill him.

3) ""The tenth doctor suffered from poor writing and character development..."" - When you have a group of people writing, there's always going to be some chaff with the wheat, but for the most part I can't agree with you here.  Poor character development?  The Doctor, when Rose met him, was an angry and slightly bitter soldier of the Time War.  After that, he came to care again, rollercoastered up and down the path of morality, suffered hope and horror and loss at the discovery of and death of the Master, had his conscience rekindled by a succession of companions, developed his guilt and anger into a short lived belief that he was going to be a godlike figure (in the Waters of Mars) and then came to terms with a rapidly approaching death that he was able to open up and speak frankly about with Wilf.  He died, once more, making the choice to save a single person.  No development?

4) Too many Slitheen episodes?  There were only three in Doctor Who, and that was because of a two-parter and then one to tidy up the loose ends.  Out of the...what, 48? 49? episodes Tennant was in, three can hardly be described as ""too many.""

5) The Weeping Angels.  Look, you might not find it scary, but that isn't to say that others don't.  There are so many things that are subjective in this world - music, art, literature and yes, fear.  Look at the sheer number of phobias there are out there, and those are just the beginning.  Whilst it's true that there are fears that are practically universal (barring some who are always outside the norm) different things scare different people.  You can certainly judge people for being ""wusses"" if you like, but that shows an unwillingness to accept that other people are different to you.  You say to try watching a scary movie?  Which ones?  Some people find some scary movies to be dull, or campy, or just funny.  Others find them terrifying.  Fear. Subjective.

I don't know who plans funerals, but it was planned yes.  She was the longest-serving prime minister in modern times (past 1900s) and got those votes for a reason (even if people think she made a conscious decision to close down what was in fact an industry killed by overseas labour costs).

Even if we ignore the domestic situation, she had an enormous positive impact in global politics, particularly with regards to the USSR.

A state funeral means that the body lies ""in state"".  I believe the majority of the cost for tomorrow is security.

An 83% top tax rate was ridiculous. It needed cutting. 

&gt;Thatcher missed the opportunity to create a £450bn nest egg for the nation.

Very annoying, but hindsight is surely 20/20.. The Norway scheme was in its early days at the time. 

&gt;Right to buy

Thatcher fucked almost everyone on that. The people that bought their council houses were given a golden goose by Thatcher at the expense of every generation that will live after. For that, I won't forgive her. At the very least she should have used the proceeds to build more social housing. 

Housing in this country is fucked now. 

&gt;The consequent boom in house prices means they are now 300% higher (in real terms) than in 1959.  If the price of a dozen eggs had risen as quickly, they would now cost £19.

I am so angry. 

Why can't we start building social housing again? It surely makes sense now that interest rates are low.

He is really, really good and I would love him to stay... but it might be hard to find a position for him. 
It will be hard to fit him in the pivot as his defending skills are not the best and from his body he's nearer Oscar than any other good pivotplayer. 
So, we would have to use him as CAM - and he surely would be a sensationel CAM...but not as good as Mata(maybe better than Oscar though, don't know)
He is no winger too, even if I think he would start for us on the wing because he's probably a better winger than Oscar and Moses isn't someone who has a save starting spot either.

Well... so, if we buy Schürrle - we would have a another really solid winger, which would make it again more difficult for de Bruyne... and we're constantly linked with other players too who are probably better options den KdB on the wing.

Still wouldn't sell him because KdB has great potential but I could see it happening... especially if Dortmund wants him. 

And in the end: I just sayed that we aren't like Arsenal who develop their talents, it's just we buy &lt;20 year old players ALL THE TIME and they rarely get first team football ever. :)

Public debt is right now is something close to 74% of GDP, with government borrowing running a deficit at around 7.5% of GDP. 

&gt;how long it will take to get out

We'll no doubt always have some level of debt, which isn't necessarily harmful so long as it isn't exorbitant, like it is now. The government once estimated that their plan would eliminate the UK's budget deficit by 2015-16, however that seems unlikely now, even by their own admission. The [OBR's](http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/about-the-obr/what-we-do/) relatively recent projections place for the deficit 2016-17 at 3.4%, and 2.2% the year following that, with public debt past 2016 in excess of 100% of GDP. So realistically we are talking about nearing end of the decade before we could be running a surplus (and remember we'll still have much existing debt despite running a surplus).

The ""austerity"" is a product of now having larger interest payments to make.

The solution is quite obviously not to start spending more.  In fact, the solution should have been to cut once and cut hard, get spending under control fast and then start building again.

The suggestion that the fix for the mess we're in -- caused by too much spending -- is more spending is just insane.

Now... that being said, the ""austerity"" has fallen very unevenly across departments, with local government taking the brunt (central government knowing full well, that they won't be blamed for local government cuts).  If the IMF had any financial sense at all, they would be telling the UK government to fix their ever-increasing deficit to get borrowing interest reducing rather than increasing as fast as possible.

Every pound spent on interest is a pound not spent on public services.  Every deficit funded pound spent on a public service this year is two pounds that can't be spent on a public service next year.

My short-term suggestion: prioritise jobs.  Suspend/cancel all capital expenditure.  Any government employee that interacts with a member of the public during the day should have their job ring fenced.  As horrible as inflation is: print money instead of borrowing it, at least printed money doesn't come with a loan agreement.

Now, that money that we have borrowed isn't free. We have to pay the people we borrowed it from money each year to cover the fact that they can't spend the money in question on things they want to spend it on, like sweets or luxury ships. The problem is that the amount that we pay to these people is based on how likely we are to pay back the loans and the money. If you aren't able to prove you can pay it back, well, you have to start paying a much higher rate. As we are so far in debt, a marginal increase in that cost can be the equivilent of the defence or education budget.

All three main parties agree that this needs to be paid down so that we stop borrowing lots more than we raise in order to show that we can manage the debt in question. The issue is over how we do this. The Government think we need to prove quickly and effectively we can manage by making deeper cuts than the opposition proposed and relying on the private sector to make up the shortfall. The opposition think that we would not risk higher rates by borrowing more over a longer period in order to keep more jobs and investment.

Now, the biggest problem is that our nation is dependent on providing services and stuff to other people, most notably the Eurozone. As a result, we can only really recover when we are able to sell stuff to them. As they are struggling due to an even bigger reliance upon debt, its doubtful how much what our government actually can do to solve the problem.

So, theres the issue. We are spending a lot more than we have, we have a lot of debt, and unless we want to spend billions more on interest payments we have to do everything we can to applease the international loans people so we can keep our low rates. Its also almost impossible to recover while the people who want to buy our stuff are struggling.

true,calgil,judoon,Judoon,"Amy is my favourite, although paradoxically I agree with every complaint you have against her. One reason I like her so much is probably because the writing and character building in the Moffat era has, I think, been so much better than before. I also think all of her 'bad points' are good points. She's human, and fallible, and makes mistakes, and sometimes is an asshole to the people who love her most - isn't overcoming those things, and even accepting them, part of the reason why the Doctor chooses and NEEDS to travel with humans? As much as I liked Rose back in the day, in hindsight her character lacked resonance because she could do no wrong. Always 'good', never messing up, and hey the Doctor was in love with her! That's boring and unrealistic. 

Also Martha...eh...she was atrociously dull. I think the great disservice to her was shoehorning in an unrequited love dynamic - she left proudly, but not really on 'good' terms with the Doctor. Rose, the love of his life, gets separated by dimensional walls. Donna tragically has her mind, and changed perspective, erased. Amy sacrificed her 'life' to be with the man she loved, choosing to give up the other man she loved. Martha walked off because a guy didn't fancy her. Hardly equates.


Also want to quickly point out, I don't like Clara much at all yet. I think she's smug and barely has any real dynamic with the Doc. It seems as though he's interested in her as a scientific curiosity, not as a person - which is all he ever seemed interested in, with Amy. Also in 'the Cold War', I don't know, it's like Clara was just in the way? At one point she's vying for the Doctor's attention, because she's scared or something, and he just kind of brushes her off, realizes that's rude and soothes her, then goes off to do something. She's an object for study until the mystery is solved. This only relates to Clara as Clara, though. Oswin was fantastic and Clara Oswin? was also interesting. So it's not the actress. I think she just needs time to develop into something interesting because I'm not happy so far.

EDIT: Further point. I think s5, 6, 7a benefited from two companions with their own dynamic. Clara at the moment seems like she could do with a Rory of her own, to bounce off. Have a horrible feeling the Welsh Sontaran will be used in future as the comic relief third guy, rather than a real character...but maybe Clara will come into her own, and a 'Rory' won't be necessary.

In Asylum of the Daleks, the doctor removes the bracelet protecting him from the nanites in the air.  At this point they Daleks are starting to convert him.  What we are watching is his subconscious ""dream"" as the Daleks attempt to convert him.  Clara is easily explained by talking to him via Pathweb.  What is impossible is not Clara, it is the fact that the doctor is under Dalek influence from the Nanites.  This is supported by the following events:

- In ""The Bells of St. John"" The Doctor knows the location of the people without Clara telling him (she tells the satellite head).  Yet the Doctor knew where to send the satellite head he controlled.  Could be that he looked at the screen, but assumptions are a dangerous thing watching Dr. Who.

- In ""The Rings of Akhaten"" he outright says it referring to opening the door.  When Clara asks if he can open the door he says ""Technically? no. In Reality? No.""  Then he opens the door.

- In ""Cold War"", the song ""Hungry Like a Wolf"", a reference to Rose, not sure where they are going with that yet.

As well, this is the 50th anniversary season, if they want to do a throwback to previous incarnations of the Doctor without breaking canon, it needs to be something like a dream, or at least not reality.

There are still a lot of details friends and I are working out, some of this is based off other theories, some is our own (or at least reached the same conclusions as others independently), but all in all it explains the questions that we have asked.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;For starters, have the employer cover the cost of any benefits the worker is receiving during their experience. You've immediately saved millions and silenced the ""taxpayer subsidising private businesses"" argument.

But it would only strengthen the argument that companies are using the scheme to pay workers below minimum wage. Currently the idea is that the workers aren’t being paid, so not taking the place of full-time paid employment. The cost to the company of looking after them during their scheme is mitigated by the extra work that gets done. If you make the company fork out to pay for people they don’t really want to employ, which company is going to sign up to the scheme?

&gt;Second, give the worker some kind of increase in their benefits while they're there. After all, you're taking away 8 hours a day that they should be using for Job Seeking - what they're getting during that time shouldn't be called Job Seekers Allowance. It doesn't have to be a huge increase, but it's inherently wrong that they're getting nothing in return for their time and effort. 

I’m not opposed to the idea of offering an incentive, but let’s not kid ourselves. We’re talking about long-term unemployed; people who have been on jobseekers for a year or more. Taking away the time they’d otherwise use for jobseeking isn’t likely to make much difference at that point (particularly given your employability is meant to drop off a cliff once you’ve been unemployed for six months). Plus they *are* getting something for their time and effort; that’s the entire point of the exercise.

&gt;Third, require that companies participating in the scheme show evidence that some actual training that serves a function in the workplace is being provided. If the only roles available are unskilled labour, then you're not creating jobs, you're reducing them by allowing paid employees to be replaced with employees on benefits. 

But this isn’t an apprenticeship scheme; I don’t think anyone is pretending it is. The point is to try and remove the taint people get from being out of work for an excessively long time, and to try and help them with their self-motivation by getting them active again. It’s not really got anything to do with training them for a specific role or trade.

&gt;Fourth, keep tabs on the progress of both claimants going through the system, and businesses taking part. Ensure that businesses are only entitled to have a certain percentage of the workforce provided by the scheme. That limits the scope for legitimate jobs being replaced by workfare positions. Remove companies from the scheme who consistently fail to hire any of the people they are training. 

I’d really hope some monitoring was already being done, just for the sake of evaluating the results of the scheme and if it’s worth continuing. But you are right.

&gt;Finally, remove the mandatory aspect. Right now, you don't have to enter workfare (although the jobcentre staff will try very hard to hide that from you) but once you're in, you can't leave without the risk of losing your benefits. That's just asking for workers to be abused, because employers KNOW they can't fight back without being left destitute. 

The scheme isn’t meant to be compulsory (although it seems jobcenter staff tend to bully people into doing it anyway), but I don’t think the system would work if you did that. Take someone who hasn’t worked for a year, tell them to turn up at 8am somewhere for a month, and what’s going to happen? Chances are they’ll stick it out a week, maybe two, then give up. Trust me; after being inactive that long your motivation is none-existent. If there is no consequence to giving up half way through, you’re very likely to give up half way through.

Unfortunately I’ve not seen any results which suggest this scheme is achieving anything, so it should probably be dropped in favor of something else. What that ‘else’ might be, I have no idea. The problem of the long-term unemployed is an extremely difficult one to deal with.

true,iruleatants,null,null,"1)Rose was an excellent base character. She wasn't super bright, but she had her moments. she cared more then anything about pretty much everything. Her compassion was amazing, and then she had moments of complete badassery (My favorite moment will always be when she looks into the tardis). Plus, she was damn fine :)

2)Martha was a very interesting character choice, and I liked her for many reasons. Namely, she was smarter then the other companions, and she stood up for what she believed in. she didn't really stand out amazingly as a companion, but she certainly had her moments of awesomeness.

3)Donna. I can't stand her and I am so happy she can no longer be in the show. She was the most annoying person on the planet. Loud, self entitled, and uptight. She constantly yelled every single episode at the stupidest things. I only liked her in ""silence in the library"". Like all companions, she had her moments of awesomeness, but between that, she just sat there and yelled at the doctor every second she didn't get her way. I felt like she was a spoiled child more then half the time.

4)Amy was an amazing companion. You are absolutely wrong about everything except for the period where she got stuck in contamination. First, she started off waiting 12 years for the doctor. Thats more then any other companion bothered to wait for him to come back. She has a very substantial personality, that you literally skipped over out of desire to hate her (I guess).  Lets start with episode two, where you see the absolute kindness of her. She outsmarts everyone and saves the lives of a magnificent creature. Then we move on to a very emotionally touching scene where she saves everyones lives and turns a person human by talking about liking someone so much that it hurts. Then we move on to her trying to sacrifice herself to save the doctor when she thinks her hand is stone. She also outsmarts everyone again by pausing the angel on the blip in the tape. She summons insane courage to walk through a group of angels without being able to see.

Yes. She does fall for the doctor. but reality check. That happens to be every single girl... ever. Hell, I'm a guy and I would fall from him. Simple girl grows  up all alone in a boring, simple town. Mysterious, sexy stranger comes, sweeps her off the world, shows her absolutely everything amazing in the world, and does some awesome, badass tricks. Yeah, she didn't stand a chance. But then comes the episode ""amy's choice"" where she blatantly choses rory over her own life. From that point on, its sealed that she cares just as much about rory. Remember how Rose just forgot about mickey? Amy blatantly chose rory over the doctor, and resolved her internal conflict. That is the part that truly won her over for me. Finally the girl chooses the nice guy.

She makes some mistakes, sure. Do you remember when she is captured by the silence and talking about her hero coming to save her? Remember how she was talking 100% about rory and not about the doctor like the writers BLATANTLY lead you to believe. 

She isn't perfect. Hell, if the love of my life disappeared for 32 years, I would be pissed all the same. thats 32 years of wondering where the hell they are. Complete and utter abandonment. You don't get over that in 5 seconds. Sorry. Yes, she makes a mistake and gives up rory because he wants kids and she can't give him that much. Guess what, that should have solidified your perception of her being a fully rounded character, unless you can't put yourself in that kind of position. she didn't do it because she wasn't able to confront him. she didn't do it because she was traumatized by the silence. She did it because she could never bring herself to face that look of disappointment on his face. That would have completely and utterly crushed her more then anything else in the entire world. More then being abandoned for 32 years, for having their child taken from them, and from losing rory. To look the person who you care the most about in the entire world in the eyes, and see disappointment, is something no one in the world can stand. That scene solidified 10000% that amy was a completely built character. She was as human as it gets, and there relationship was alive and real. In my eyes, she is so far the best companion, simply because she was properly built up, and fully developed. All of the companions before her (as far as the 2005 reboot) failed to be built up to this point. They were great, don't get me wrong. But we see every single side of amy, and we see her literally grow as a person in multiple episodes. The other characters do not have a backstory like this. She started out as a little girl dreaming of being safe, to a young adult wishing for her imaginary friend to come and rescue her from a mediocre life. This is something billions of people can relate to. Then we have a girl caught in a conflict between the exotic, mysterious stranger, and the safe, and caring best friend. She makes the best choice there. She struggles constantly with moral dilemmas, Can she shoot a child to safe the greatest person to ever exist? (Could you, to save the doctor?). 

finally. Clara.

I loved her from the second that she was introduced. But these last 3 episodes? Meh.

First episode of this season. 10000000000% predictable ""Most important leaf in the world. Currency are objects with meaning. Obviously she is going to sacrifice it"" ""Tells girl that nothing will go wrong, something goes wrong, she feels responsible"". ""doctor in trouble, she goes back to save him (Aka, every companion ever)"". Yes, she has been great. But there is no character building. Nothing to separate her from rose/martha/donna. The built us this entire mystery about how she is impossible, and are focusing 100% on that, instead of who she is, and how she acts. I loved the snowmen episodes. she was clever, witty, and caring in that episode. Taking care of the children gave her a great backstory. But in the second part of the second, they glazed over her relationship with the family completely, in return for her being too caught up in not knowing how to use the internet.

Needless to say, I love her, but I want them to build her more, and better. she ever said the ""its bigger on the inside"" like all of the other companions. Too much focus on her mysterious capacity to die twice in a row, and nothing on the rest of her life/story.",0,1366126751,null,0,false,0,c9gbpz9,t3_1cfazp,t1_c9gbpz9,t3_1cfazp,null,1431538155,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

That's the idea. But that's not what's happening. 

&gt; If you make the company fork out to pay for people they don’t really want to employ, which company is going to sign up to the scheme?

I personally think it's better that companies choose not to participate than increase unemployment further by replacing their staff with unpaid workers. 

&gt; this isn’t an apprenticeship scheme; I don’t think anyone is pretending it is. The point is to try and remove the taint people get from being out of work for an excessively long time, and to try and help them with their self-motivation by getting them active again. 

The threat of being made destitute is motivation of sorts, but it's certainly not an effective way of getting a motivated worker. People are remarkably inventive when faced with adversity, especially when combined with the resentment that is bound to occur if they feel  unjustly treated. 

What we have right now is people being forced to work with a near certain knowledge that there is no job, or even improved chances of getting a job, at the end of it. All this will achieve is people turning up and doing the absolute bare minimum of work required to not get thrown off the scheme. Some will seek to redress the balance through 'accidental' stock damage etc. The inventive ones will keep their eye open for opportunities to turn the situation to their advantage - for example by engineering a workplace accident or a sexual harassment claim that could result in a nice settlement for them. 

Not to mention the fact that, if you have the massive power imbalance whereby you're forced to turn up to ""work"" on threat of homelessness, you might not **need** to engineer a sexual harrassment claim if you find yourself working with the wrong people.

Amy's exposure to the cracks meant she could remake things as she remembered them - her parents, the Doctor, Rory. This includes 'real' Rory instead of Auton Rory, possibly a new amalgamation of the two beings - she remembered both, so the new universe has both.

The only event erased is the Big Bang itself. As soon as the new, identical universe comes into existence, everything (past and future) is the same as it was, except for that, which was averted. Even the effects of the cracks themselves do not prevent people from having existed, just puts a perception filter - as IF that person never existed, though the consequences of their lives continue. And future iterations of that person cease to exist, but that's self-evident.

Will I get anything out of this volunteering which will help me find paid work? If yes, why? If not, please explain why you are volunteering.

How will this volunteering help your job search?

How long will you be volunteering for?

Do you have a contract with this organisation?

How can we contact you about jobs or interviews whilst you are volunteering?

Would you be able to attend an interview within 48 hours of us asking you to go? If not, why?

Following all these questions is a section marked 'office use only' which essentially outlines that if the Jobcentre does not accept your reasons for volunteering, you are able to be referred for stopping your benefits.

true,spudboyblues,present,Mata,"Contrary to what people have been saying about this, I really support this move if it in fact comes to pass. For starters, thankfully they didn't take the swap deal with KDB; but this move in no way jeopardizes De Bryune's future at the Bridge. KDB and Schürrle are two different types of players; the former is more of a playmaker/runner combo, while the latter is more of a winger/kind-of-striker combo. They're both very versatile, but I would imagine that they'd fill different roles; for instance in a 4-3-3, I would imagine KDB would play in the midfield three while Schürrle would play as one or the wide men in the front three. It's important to note that difference. 

As far as who will be let go and why it matters in relation to this deal, I can see: Marin, Benayoun, and Malouda all leaving this summer (not to get started on the Lamps issue), and between Schürrle, KDB, Piazon, and Moses backing up Mazacar, our squad will be much deeper and versatile than it is currently. Look at Man U/City; their benches are very deep, which is why they are where they are in the table. Having a rotation involving players like Marin and Benayoun - who are, let's face it, not quite top quality depth - has really cost us this season, IMO. Whether we should have even been in that situation is another debate entirely, but we're here now. 

Incidentally, I think that if this signing happens, it might indicate that we aren't in for a big-name striker for the summer and - as we should - are trusting Lukaku. Schurrle can, in a pinch, fill in that role. Which means we can focus more resources on bulking up the midfield and CMs. Thankfully.

&gt;Economists' numbers.

I guess you are reading a different Economist to me.

&gt;The only argument is that she destroyed the unions and allowed a failed industry to die. 

Well she forced a lot of industries to die and manufacturing out of the UK. Coal was not dead at the time but the union model was. It isn't dead now either which is why the UK imports so much.

&gt; Short term it was bad for a lot of people, long-term it's only been bad for those who've refused to move out of their former mining villages

It would have been nice to move but the prices in the areas with jobs (London and the SE) had already taken off.

&gt;exceedingly good for the vast majority of the population from rich to poor - wealth grew faster than inflation for all classes of people in her terms.

Really?

You have to remember that Thatcher was extremely good at spending the wealth that others had built up. She was less good at creating wealth herself and lousy at long-term planning.

The problem was that with her 'reforms', she had no transition plan. It was purely protecting the interests of the haves. The have nots were engineered off the unemployed statistics faster than she could claim ""Labour isn't working"".

What I particularly detest about her is that she was not democratic and disbelieved in the consensus. She attacked rather than reformed democratic worker's representation as well as destroying the system of local authorities. It was her military cuts that ended up sending the wrong signal to Galtieri, triggering the Falklands conflict.

OTOH, she was good at improving foreign relations and engaged positively with Gorbachev and some of her privatisations were ultimately very successful, ridding the industry of rent-seeking monopolies.",0,1366128729,null,0,1366129078,0,c9gcg9m,t3_1cgf1j,t1_c9gcg9m,t1_c9gbmsa,null,1431537811,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The relationship between 10th and Rose was a very human love relationship. Passion, insecurity, heartbreak. It was the type of relationship the 10th, as a rather human Doctor, would have.

The relationship between 11th and River is very different. It's more flirty, but also more childlike and innocent. They're married, but often it feels more like two young children playing house. Not, importantly, in the sense that it's fake or not real or something stupid like that. But that it's a more innocent and childlike love. Not as weighed down with passion and emotional baggage and sexual tension would be another way to put it.

(I actually really like how if you rewatch some of the scenes with the young River Song, especially ""Nights with the Doctor"" you can see how who is the child and who is the grown-up started out with the Doctor as the grown-up and ended up switching later. I feel the show isn't always great at making these things obvious, or being consistent about them, but if you look for it there are moments when it really works)

I think 11th did come to love River (TATM made that pretty clear imo), but it is the type of childlike semi-platonic love that is at times hard to distinguish from close friendship.

true,LeTouche,num30-away,,"Rose is not adequate cover for LB, he's simply not good enough, and I doubt he ever will be. Benny. We'll see. There've been rumours that we might be in the market for someone, but I've no idea how those will shape up. I'm hearing we're in for Alderwield, which might allow us to use  Jan at LB permanently. Gallas will likely go, although he's been offered an ambassadorial role at the club, so we'll see, again.

That's the defence covered. In terms of midfield, I can, sadly, see Scotty or THudd going, one of the two. But it depends if we're going in for Moutinho again, or if there's another player, perhaps more used to a 4-3-3 system, that we can find. I don't see Dempsey leaving, not at all. He's good, proven in the league, has a lot of experience, and is great in important moments. He's a decent player, though, again, we'll see. I'd like us to find a pacey winger as backup, or to utilise Townsend, if he's good enough, so that may change things.

Strikers... I just wouldn't have the first clue. If we're in for a striker, I'd like us to keep the two current ones to avoid lack of depth we had this season. But if one goes, we'll surely get a top quality striker. We'll see. It is all speculation. I don't think a striker will leave, even if one comes.

Finally, Bale, as you say. Well, I don't really see him leaving. A combination between his daughter, his BT (is it BT?) contract, and his 4 years on his contract for us, I don't see him going. Plus, Levy.

So she's always a surprise to him, which is a pretty unique thing. When he heals her wrist in TATM, and they fix up the Tardis, I think we see that they've had a lot of time together that wasn't in episodes- because it was just them together! Just their marriage! Not a story. (Which yeah, I'd say started for him well after their wedding, but the other way around for her... or something. I'm still confused on the weddings.

I don't think the relationship between River and the Doctor is a romantic one, at least not from his end. If you want to get technical - the wedding was not valid. It wasn't the Doctor, it was the Tesselecta, he didn't tell her his name, and so on. Even if we put the ""wedding"" aside - he's just not 'there' emotionally, he doesn't trust her as far as he could throw her if he has any choice in the matter and whenever she appears she annoys him more than anything else. 

Personally, I don't think the Doctor is or should be romantic with River. I don't think he was or should've been romantic with Rose either. Yes, there was that ""Rose, I..."" moment, but the sentence was left unfinished for a reason: so that all the fans could enjoy their own interpretation of their relationship. 

In my mind, if  the Doctor was ever going to have even the slightest chance of being romantic with someone, it could've been Idris. That was the only time I ever got the actual utter love vibe from him, as in - I want to spend the rest of my life with you. And he will, in a way.

Don't know about moving Jan to LB either, he doesn't look that great when he is there, he doesn't quite have the pace for it.  It'd be silly to move our best defender currently to a position he is less familiar with, especially since he joined the club specifically to play CB. 

 I wouldn't be shocked if Parker and Huddlestone both left, though only if we have a replacement lined up for at least 1 of them.  Dempsey will likely stay until at least the winter, where he will only have 18 months on his contract.  Don't expect him to see through his entire contract with Spurs. 

I also am unsure about strikers.  Levy would hopefully realize we need a better than average striker if we truly want to be in the Champions League, or make a good performance of it if we do make it this year.

Future employers are much more likely to view you in a positive light if you've demonstrated that you can hold down a job / turn up on time / not get fired.

As someone who has managed and fired employees myself, I find this exceedingly hard to believe. 

My experience was with contractors and we could never get enough good people with the required skillset, but we took on pretty much everybody and anybody.

About the only thing we cared about when I was involved in managing people was *can they do they job?*

Yes, obviously we cared about *will they keep turning up every day?*, but that's really not something a curriculum vitae will actually tell you.

The only measure of performance that mattered a jot to us was how you performed in *this* job. We'd try and treat our guys fair, and trust them to look out for us.
