This isn't a one-or-the-other situation. He doesn't want to do panel shows because he felt he was being censored.

&gt;I take a totally different interpretation to that - the BBC have stopped asking him on their panel shows, and when they give him an opportunity to redeem himself with a slot on Comic Relief, he makes a joke they can't air.

First off, he left his panel show of his own accord. Secondly, why on earth should he have to ""redeem himself"" in front of the BBC? I imagine when he got the invite for Comic Relief, he saw it as an opportunity for one last ""fuck you"" to an organisation he has no intention of working for again.

&gt;Whether or not you think he should be allowed to say these things, the problem is that he's making jokes about how a ""ugly"" woman swimmer is and about disabled kids and stuff.

I'm sure I'm not more in the loop at the club than you are, having not talked to anybody at Chelsea or even been to the club.  I've seen your posts here and enjoy them, you're probably more 'inside' Chelsea than anybody on the subbreddit, I'm just throwing my opinion out there from what i've read and seen.

You have to give United some credit here and acknowledge that they've done incredibly well at buying talent on the cheap and selling high while Ferguson's been there.  If that's been Fergie himself calling the shots and demanding the players then fair deal, though do you think the manager that takes over from Fergie is going to get the same 'what I say I get' policy that Ferguson was allegedly privy to?

United's recent recruitment history looks as if they almost always go the 'buy young and develop up' route (RVP being the glaringly obvious outlier).  You don't have to rub shoulders with Chelsea brass to see how their recruitment has been a bit different to Chelsea's.
We have spent big in the past for big name players and the perception is that it's Roman who gives the say.  Of course it's not as simplistic as that, but you'd be shooting the messenger if you think I'm a dick for saying it.  Of course it can't just be Roman playing 'Guess Who' with Chelsea's roster but you said so yourself nobody really knows.  Mou came in and instantly spent up big to build Chelsea's squad.  He did the same at Real.  If he were to come to Chelsea do you not think he'd do the same again?  If Roman is the one with the wallet and Mourinho is the one who has a history of coming in and instantly calling in the players he wants, at a cost of tens of millions, that's going to create a perception for recruitment.  An incredibly simplistic perception but one that gets bandied around about Chelsea since Roman took over. 

I'm going off the assumption that if Mourinho were to come back to Chelsea he'd have the same privilege it looks like he had when he first came to the club, and the one he had at Real, and the one that you say Ferguson had.

true,MagmaSuperstar,somerset,Wurzel County UK,"I wasn't implying everyone should be black belts, in part it was pointing out the fact that size isn't everything in terms of defence and secondly illustrating martial arts as a secondary option of self defence. Black belts aren't the only people in a class like that that can defend themselves. Also as a side note we can't expect everyone to know how to properly handle a gun under stress which is just a recipe for trouble in a lot of cases.

With regards a hidden firearm if you have one on you the temptation is going to be to use it, even in situations which don't require it because the mindset is 'I have this for self defence so I'm going to use it' when honestly the best way to avoid violence would be to scream for help and run.

I've never said I support a culture with a complete lack of defensive firearm usage in fact I've said the opposite numerous times, it was an illustration of the justification for telling people what other methods they can use in reply to your previous comment. It's justified because of laws and an idea of proportional response.

So long as your argument isn't solely that self defensive firearms are good because the simple fact that good guys can shoot bad guys will sort everything out then we agree. It's one particularly simplistic argument I hate not the idea of self defensive firearms usage in certain situations, as again I have said in just about every post I've made.

Summary: Self defensive firearms usage is justifiable and positive in SOME situations, it is harmful and damaging in others. Don't pretend it's as simple as good guy vs bad guy and that stops crime since the average person (good guy) is liable to misinterpret situations, panic and behave in unpredictable ways when under stress and this should be taken into account then we agree.",0,1368285993,null,0,false,0,c9wrt6f,t3_1e2ovg,t1_c9wrt6f,t1_c9wquq6,null,1431227766,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So instead RTD focused on a version from a parallel universe, where they were made on a parallel earth by a company called Cybus industries.  They eventually made it to our universe.  Every time a Cyberman shows up through Tennant they're the Cybus Cyberman.

In terms of how they're different; functionally they're not; they behave the same way(well, RTD tried to give them a Dalek-like catchphrase: ""Delete!""). But the viewers see the entire history of the Cybus Cybermen, from their creation to their arrival in our universe, to their destruction. At no point do they get away, escape earth, build a space empire.  When Moffat took over he didn't want to mess with any of that, so he just switched focus to the Cybermen that had been in our universe the whole time. 

If you're not the sort of person who notices or cares that band of refugees without space travel(Cybus Cybermen in their last appearance) suddenly have a whole fleet that the Doctor and Rory can blow up two seasons later it doesn't matter at all.

Bland and generic. It has lots of chain stores and there is nothing personal about it. There's also a huge lack of greenery in the main shopping area.


**The history of Liverpool**

No, because it looks nothing like the rest of Liverpool and while that isn't a bad thing, it clashes. Going to Liverpool One is like leaving the rest of Liverpool and going somewhere else.

More affordable housing would be better than expensive apartments.

I think there is an issue with public transport around Liverpool One. The nearest train station would be Moorfields, but this is still a five minute walk away. While this isn't very far at all, for those with disabilities, it is. Similarly, there is no road access to the centre of Liverpool One, the nearest road being near the Albert Dock and then having to climb a lot of stairs. While I'm not disabled myself, I think disabled access is very important and having a drop off area for cabs in the centre of Liverpool One would have been very useful.

You're absolutely right, you are a whinging postman.

I can't control how British Gas, Scottish Power, BT or Virgin address my mail, no matter how hard I try.  I'm sure, if you're honest, that you've had the same problem.  It takes me six phone calls just to get them to stop using my neighbours meter readings!

Not that any of this is relevant, I live in a house not a flat but you still deliver post to me that is clearly marked for the flats down the road.  That's got nothing to do with my house number, has it?

Now, on the other hand, you are being paid to do a job.  If you can't do it properly then you don't deserve the pay.  If you spent a little more time concentrating on which floor you were on (and a little less time figuring out which envelope my T in the Park tickets were in) then half of these addresses wouldn't be a problem for you.

Anyway, delivering to the bottom of a stair sounds like quite an achievement for you.  Most of the time, even if I open the door to you, all I get is a card saying that you're sorry you missed me and my parcel will be available for collection sometime tomorrow at the depot.

true,MagmaSuperstar,somerset,Wurzel County UK,"It's mainly why I despair at gun control arguments, if there's ever an area of policy that shouldn't be decided in a shouting match or through hyperbole and spin it's firearms control.

I grew up on a small farm, my dad has guns for pest control mostly. I've never killed anything but I grew up using air rifles to shoot at cans and tried my hand at clay pigeon shooting. My skill at the latter varies depending on the location of the trap relative to my position but generally speaking I suck.

My support for restrictions on guns comes mainly from the way I was taught to use them by my dad, he had a total no tolerance policy when it came to misuse. You obeyed his rules to the letter when you were handling a gun, any gun, or you didn't use it simple as that. At times this has brought me into disagreements with American gun rights advocates, the viewing of it as a constitutional right doesn't really exist in the UK. Their attitude is people have a right to own guns on a 'shall issue' basis, whereas I see it as something you have to prove you're responsible enough to use. Driving license style testing like the example you gave.

One issue is many people I've spoken to who support bans on guns or seriously tight gun restrictions have never been near a gun in their life or been around the sort of people who have. On a semi related note a lot of my dads friends own guns, typically shotguns but also rifles, and I don't think I've ever heard any of them discuss a gun as a means of self defence.

But my main point was that if you can't get any kind of consistency in how shit's addressed, at least put your flat number on your door. I would estimate that 40% of flats don't have a number on them. Which means I have to stand there trying to figure out if the flat on the left is number 3, or the flat on the right. I would love to have the time to do that, but out walks are timed to the second, and I simply don't have the time.  Plus, what happens if (god forbid), you need an ambulance, and THEY can't figure out which flat called them?   
I'm not making excuses for shit delivered wrong if everything (including your house) is labelled properly. As I said, I'm delivering to nearly a thousand addresses every day, and I've been on a different walk every day for the past two weeks. I'm bound to make mistakes.   
Now, as far as parcels go, we hear that complaint a lot.

And on top of all these, you have to consider that many foreigners are totally unfamiliar with the addressing systems in Europe in general. I'm not saying they should not learn it (they live here) but I am saying that its not easy for them.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"Try reading more international news and the BBC's biases will become very apparent. Just contrast the reporting on ""regimes"" verses the dictators we like. Gaddafi is a great example, the BBC switched to supporting him between 2001 and 2009. Check their archives and compare the words used to describe either his ""government"" or ""regime"", all depending on how the UK government felt at that time. The moment we started selling him weapons in 2002 they were printing fluff pieces about his social programs &amp; avoiding the words ""dictator"", ""torture"" and ""regime"" entirely. Post-2009 almost every report made use of all three words. 

Just this morning they were saying how wonderful the Pakistan election was until ignoring the violence became impossible. No mention of the widespread corruption being reported by foreign networks. There's no mention of the reports that women have been prevented from voting in the north west of the country, in fact the article is saying how great it was that women can vote! Last time they were saying that (2008) it wasn't true then either; many female-only polling booths had 0% turnout. 

Given the BBCs reporting you can expect ""our guy"" to win this election; if the reporting of the elections legitimacy were negative then it would indicate that we do not like who will win. 

Alternatively, take a look at the Syria reporting. Earlier in the week they had a headline about a ""massacre"" of 40 rebels, this piece was on the second-tier front page headlines for the majority of the day. Two days later it was reported that the rebels had been caught using chemical weapons, a far more serious war crime. This was relegated to a text-only headline on the 4th or 5th tier for a few hours but only on the ""World"" page, not the front page.

Teignmouth on the other hand is lovely - a fairly pretty seaside-y small town close enough to Exeter to be able to get out pretty easily if you need to.  Not sure if the railway gets there but Newton Abbot is very close and buses around the Torbay area seem pretty good and regular.

Property prices in the town are above average for the area but are more sensible in Newton Abbot, Torquay, and especially Paignton and Brixham.  Bear in mind the traffic if you live that far out, as Torquay gets clogged very easily and it can take ages sometimes to get a short distance.

You're also very close to the moors, the bright city lights of Exeter and &lt;cough&gt; Plymouth if you must, and lovely lovely lovely Totnes with the best record shop I've ever seen is close too.

Pretty much solely because of this he knows he should probably trust her because not just anyone could know his name. Now fast forward and drop her periodically in his life. For the most part he still doesn't know anything about her, who she is, why she knew his name. She acts like theres a thing between them but its not explicit so I mean what can he do but play along awkwardly not really knowing. Fast forward and he knows who she is now, from all his past experiences with her he knows a lot of their future, their off-screen adventures so in a way he needs to keep up the sudo-relationship because he knows its in his time line. So forced is a good way to put it.

TL:DR 
She knows everything about him and seems to have had soo many experiences with him he hasn't had yet and therefore his timeline forces him to be in a relationship not by his own choice

A lot of us, including some liberals like me, don't like the big federal government. We like the thought of being able to enact laws within our own state, where there is more contact with the constituency. If you can get in contact with a national senator or a national representative, that is a huge fucking deal. But it's much easier to get in contact with your representative at a local or state level. I knew a guy who wrote a bill with a state senator once and it's not a big deal. Enacting policies at the state level is what conservatives like, and some liberals like me like too. But of course, a majority of liberals are stupid fuckwads and just have to see everything they believe in legislated to people all the way on the other coast.

Why do I mention this? Because the federal government has so many fucking agencies that they have more power than congress itself. The agencies are what we feel are the tyrants. We don't vote for them, they get appointed. 

And this is reminiscent of the civil war for us. The civil war, despite what you learned in history class, was not for slavery. It was a fear of Lincoln and the republicans drastically increasing the power of the federal government through taxes, military, and even abolition of slavery. History is written by the victor. Despite being more racist than lincoln and the North, the south had the right idea. They were right, Lincoln, the racist fuckwad, drastically increased the power of the federal government and completely took away power from the states for a while. Now, some things the southern states did were wrong in the issues of race for a great while. But after slavery ended, the beauty of the States is that you can move away from a state you don't like. And it's very easy, even now. (Well, maybe not now if you have a job and all). But blacks could have migrated very easily to the north, which a great many did. 

The issue of gun control and all becoming federal, and them legislating and executing control of the people at the federal level where very few people have any say is what we hate. And yes, that is why people fear the need to revolt. 

&gt; enter into a civil war against the largest military force on the planet?

You fail to realize that the majority of the military are conservative/libertarian and would never fight against their own people. Plus, the government can't and won't bomb its own populace. If it did, it would just gain more enemies. It would be guerrilla vs. conventional warfare, and we all know who wins. You can't stop guerrilla resistance very easily, hence, Afghanistan.

&gt; For the average Briton it's more important that everyone has their freedoms restricted for the good of all than for everyone to have those freedoms to the detriment of society

I don't see that mindset in the U.S. at all, except for a select few. When I was young, and was/still am a leftist, I thought liberalism advocated for the most freedom. I always saw freedom as a great thing, and freedom shouldn't be sacrificed for security. I now realize liberals are usually the ones who feel the opposite way. Of course, conservatives like to legislate morality at times, but liberals as a whole here support big government more. To me, being a liberal meant having a social safety net that requires little sacrifice of freedom. While keeping shit legal and allowing the people to have what they want. I guess I'm really just a ""liberaltarian"". 

&gt; Rather than ""I am free to control my destiny"", American individualism is frowned upon as an ""I got mine, fuck you"" attitude.

I think you'll find that [conservatives](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/conservatives_more_liberal_giv.html), who generally have this mindset, give far more than liberals. It's not that they don't want to give, they don't want to give through government. 

You earn something? You're free to do what you want with it, and a vast majority of those people donate a great much to charity. So, it's not really an ""I got mine, fuck you"" attitude.

true,defiantchaos,,"Your finest San Pelligrino ","Not as big as /r/malefashionadvice but there is /r/europeanmalefashion which I also follow. 

I tend to stick to classic styling, usually an athletic cut to fit my frame better. No graphic tees. 

Layering is pretty important. Watch, belt, shoes, etc play a bigger part than I had realised anyway.

 I'm not exactly loaded so I take advantage of shops that usually do 2 for a tenner on plain tees that have a decent fit and are built well. Pretty good for practicing layering with a cut you're comfortable with.  On the opposite, I also take time in buying more expensive items that I know will last a long damn time.

A tip I picked up from another redditor somewhere was this ""Never wear something that has more personality than you"". I make sure to follow that whenever I am shopping and it has definitely made me dress better and actually get compliments (which is pretty new for me).

Edit: Forgot to mention hair styling, facial hair and general grooming takes play too. A different haircut can completely change how people perceive your face in terms of shape as well as matching the 'look' you're going for with whatever you're wearing.

Warwick proposing to Clara at the last minute came from nowhere.

So the Doctor fancies Clara now? Urgh, spare me.

The Cybermen have been extinct for 1000 years. And yet they have weaponry and protocols, still intact and ongoing, for defeating them. Clearly the planet implosion Emperor deus ex machina was designed for an Emperor who was on a planet with a Cyberman, to defeat the enemy and escape...but surely it hasn't been used for 1000 years. So why was Warwick so confident the spaceship would pick him up in 20 seconds? I would think 'Shit probably nobody even knows about this protocol anymore. They might not come.'

It WAS incredibly obvious that Warwick was the Emperor. If people didn't realize it, why did nobody bat an eyelash when Tamsin Outhwaite called him 'sir'? 

Sick of the 'impossible girl' thing now. Doctor's diatribe at the end really did not need to happen - we GET IT. It added nothing new.

All in all, terrible episode. And I never usually say this. Only saving grace was the prequel episode which came afterwards. Not that that actually revealed anything, but created some anticipation for Name of the Doctor next week.

true,M2Ys4U,eu,Manchester,"&gt;You still haven't given anywhere near a compelling reason why we shouldn't have a vote on it

I'm not saying we *shouldn't* have a referendum, I'm trying to explain why we *haven't* had a referendum - they're really rare in the UK.

&gt;the EU is an infinitely bigger issue for the voting population than AV ever was

It's [really not that big of an issue](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BJ_rkA_CYAAELrh.jpg:large) in absolute terms, if you believe the polling data; it hasn't been an important issue for more than 10% of the population for the last 8 years.

&gt; so even by your own measure - it exceeds the requirement for a referendum.

I haven't really set out any measure of a requirement for a referendum. All I've done it state that UK-wide referenda are rare, so rare that there have only ever been two. I don't think that not having a referendum to date has been ""denying"" anybody anything, it's how the constitutional set-up of the UK has worked to date.

Of course with a constitution that relies heavily on convention attitudes do change, and the attitude towards this has been changing slightly as evidenced by the statutory referenda if powers are transferred away from UK government to the EU in new treaties.

&gt; I think that's where it all falls down for me, people keep trying to belittle those who talk about leaving the EU but are wholly unwilling to allow democracy to decide it.

I think that the idea that the UK should withdraw from the EU should be belittled. The rhetoric (not to mention that outright lies[0]) that the anti-EU crowd throws around is terrible at times.

I'm perfectly content to have a referendum on this issue, provided that it's a fair and honest debate about the issue.

&gt;How you can reconcile the EU being this great democratic organisation whilst simultaneously denying the people of a country inside of it to decide whether it's worth it is beyond me.

&gt;Of course, we know the answer is that pro-EU people are terrified of the outcome of an EU referendum so they'll do anything they can to ensure one doesn't happen. Whichever side of the debate you're on, you should be willing to have a conversation about it and should be confident enough in your convictions that you can put across the positives to attain a stay-in result.

I'm not claiming that it's a ""great democratic organisation"" - I said in my previous reply that the complaints about the democratic deficit are correct. For instance, the Council of the EU is completely opaque and needs to be opened up. The Commission probably shouldn't be the only body that has the right of legislative initiative and the state of lobbying in Brussels is ridiculous, for a start.

What I am saying is that, compared to the alternative (Westminster) it is a *more* democratic institution.

And, as I said above, I'm not saying that we shouldn't have a referendum, as long as the debate is fair and honest.


(Although, the irony of having a plebiscite to show that British parliamentary sovereignty and not European pooled sovereignty reigns supreme is amusing to me.)

Same thing with the 50th anniversary eBooks the BBC have been releasing - I pre-ordered all eleven; of the four that have been released so far only one was interesting, and that was due to the fact it contained both The Master, and a tonne of Lovecraft references.

Otherwise, they have to fill out the slip, fill out their own cards (if it's not on PDA), take it over to the den (where we drop packets we can't deliver), and then potentially deliver it again anyway when you ask for a redelivery.  
I've been accused of just what you are saying, but believe me, I have never, ever taken out a slip instead of a parcel. It just simply doesn't make sense. You won't get away with leaving parcels at the depot, anyway.  
One thing that CAN happen (which maybe explains what happened to you?) is if the driver delivering a large parcel can't get into your building at all. He's only supposed to ring YOUR flat, whereas the postman delivering letters can ring every flat he's got post for. So the postman winds up getting cards for all the parcels where the driver couldn't get into the building. Sometimes it can take an extra day or two for the card to make it to the postman's frame.

“No man in this country is under the smallest obligation, moral or other, so to arrange his legal relations to his business or to his property as to enable the Inland Revenue to put the largest possible shovel into his stores.  The Inland Revenue is not slow – and quite rightly – to take every advantage which is open to it under the taxing statutes for the purpose of depleting the taxpayer’s pocket.

I have to confess that I do my best to avoid Frankie Boyle. This is no mean feat because he seems to be ubiquitous. I don't know that his comedy is a reflection of his personality (there is no reason for me to suppose that he is not a reasonably intelligent man with political opinions) but I do think that it is carefully base in its offensiveness. By that I mean that the nature of the offense comes, not from an attack on a belief etc, but from an excessive amount of crudeness. This is not true for all of his material, but it is true for enough of it that people mistake crudeness for 'being controversial'. 

Now, I am not suggesting that he be censored. I have chosen to turn off my TV rather than watch him. I think that this is the best solution for anyone who feels offended by anything really. After all, I have the right to be offended, but that right does not extend to shutting down the source of the offense. (Indeed, in the case of the Harvey Price joke, the only people who were really empowered to be angry belonged to his family).

There is clearly a market for his work. He sells out stadiums, books and DVDs. However, it is slightly galling to hear him talk about his comic output as if it were something that is largely rejected by the mainstream. Being vilified in the Daily Mail is not enough to make him a renegade comedian. 

That is pretty much all I mean when I criticise him.

It seems as though the EU have created a problem (the euro) which can only be solved by giving them more power. I'm assuming the creators of the euro weren't stupid people, they must have known it wouldn't work in the form it was introduced in, but I also think they knew that they couldn't introduce it with all the powers it really needed to succeed.

If they'd tried to introduce the euro with debt mutualisation, fiscal transfers and shared budgets which are required to make it work then I don't think enough countries would've agreed. So instead they introduced it in a half baked form, but they knew that eventually all those countries who are members would have to give up those extra powers because it wouldn't work without them.

The thing is, these are really important powers, once given away they pretty much can't be got back. Once they're gone, they're gone for good, so I really hate the idea that this decision, to join the euro was made by alot of countries under false pretenses, they were told they were joining a currency  when in fact they were committing to much much more than that.

But more broadly, it very much feels to me as though once you've transferred a certain amount of power away from a national parliament like Westminster then really you no longer have a country anymore, you've got a province. We've been a sovereign nation for centuries, it feels like to just give that up in return for a few economic benefits is a really stupid thing to do.

But that's just my opinion, I don't think many other people think like me, as long as their life's a bit better in the EU then they'll be quite happy to integrate further and further until the UK doesn't really exist anymore.

&gt; What does Jimmy Carr take that makes you think he is morally obliged to give some £1-2 million of tax per year to everyone else? 

Didn't specify a figure - just that it should be a fair amount. 

&gt; Why does the fact he shares an island with us mean we are entitled to a share of his wealth?

What seriously? Serious question? Um because every single day he enjoys the trappings of a shared society that is paid for by everyone. If he is in peril the military &amp; police will defend him. If his house is on fire the fire brigade will put it out. If his kids need educating the state will offer. If he is squashed in a car he will be mended by an A&amp;E department paid for by taxes. His 'customers' are supplied by that same society, the roads they travel to his gigs are paid for by that society, filling the civic centres that housed his early gigs - need I go on? EVERYBODY enjoys these things and therefore *ethically* everyone should contribute. If you dont want to then fine - piss off to somewhere where you dont enjoy the benefits. 

&gt; Here is the judgement handed down by Lord Clyde in 1929 with regard to this issue: “No man in this country is under the smallest obligation, moral or other, so to arrange his legal relations to his business or to his property as to enable the Inland Revenue to put the largest possible shovel into his stores. The Inland Revenue is not slow – and quite rightly – to take every advantage which is open to it under the taxing statutes for the purpose of depleting the taxpayer’s pocket. And the taxpayer is, in like manner, entitled to be astute to prevent, so far as he honestly can, the depletion of his means by the Revenue.”

You have mentioned that you dont think the law equates to ethics but again you cite legalities to make your case against the morality of not paying taxes. Either way the judgement is by one person, in 1929 when the complexity of the law and financial instruments was very different. The law is different now too. There are many principles that mean you can't simply take a technical loophole and exploit it, and now there is general abuse legislation which will prevent even further avoidances / evasions. What some guy said about it in 1929 is hardly the be all and end all of tax ethics.

true,vitaminbillwebb,troughton,Troughton,"I tend to like my *Doctor Who* weird, so I'm likely to pass up some bonafide classics in favor of episodes that skew that way. 

Actually, while Netflix is missing the sixth Doctor altogether, the remaining episodes are a really good selection. 

1. ""The Daleks""
2. ""Evil of the Daleks,"" but ""The Mind Robber,"" which is on Netflix is probably tied for this spot. Troughton has the dubious honor of being my favorite Doctor, while I hate most of his stories. These two, however, are solid gold. 
3. ""Carnival of Monsters""
4. ""City of Death,"" possibly the finest serial of the original series.
5. ""Mawdryn Undead"" or ""Terminus."" The episodes available on Netflix are ""The Visitation,"" which I didn't really care for and ""Caves of Androzani."" ""Caves"" is one of those bonafide classics I don't really care for. The usual take I hear from its fans is that, in comparison with the rest of the season, it's by far the best. That may be true, but it's also nihilistic, humorless (in my memory at least, but perhaps not in fact) and leads up to what, for my money, is the most abrasive regeneration sequence imaginable. In short, it may be a good--even a great--episode, but it's not good as an introduction to Davison's Doctor.
6. Dunno. I've not been able to get any Sixth Doctor stories. I'm curious what BBCA will choose to re-air for Baker II, given that his run is pretty universally reviled. The one I'm interested enough in to chance is ""The Two Doctors,"" and that's primarily because it features Troughton. Maybe they'll air that one!
7. ""Remembrance of the Daleks,"" a great serial that does continuity porn right. We get a ton of callbacks to ""An Unearthly Child,"" but missing them means missing exactly nothing of the serial's plot proper. 
8. Sigh. The TV Movie is your only option. I hear there are some good Big Finish Audios with McGann, though, and he was the Doctor used to perform a flash-animated version of the lost Douglas Adams episode ""Shada.""

I assume you've seen 9-11, but here's my breakdown.

9. ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances.""  It's odd not to include any Davies episodes in his era, though, so if I had to pick an ep. actually by Davies--and therefore more representative of his era--I'd pick ""Boom Town."" 
10. ""Silence in the Library/Forests of the Dead."" Again, though, to get the flavor of Davies' take on the series, I'd go with the two-parter ""The Stolen Earth/Journey's End."" That's one that really gives a sense of the massiveness of Davies' finales.
11. ""The Doctor's Wife,"" but we'll see how I feel after tonight.",0,1368304904,null,0,1368305416,0,c9wwvc5,t3_1e53do,t1_c9wwvc5,t3_1e53do,null,1431225300,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I have to point out though, that mentioning Cameron's background is not a criticism of his policies on, say immigration (or whatever he might want to criticize). All it does it give us some cracks about Cameron being so posh that... [insert lazy finish here]. There is nothing wrong with that kind of humour (as evidenced by people like Michael McIntyre who source their material almost exclusively from the banality of middle-class life) but it is hardly new, exciting, or inventive.

Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to mention that I have never read the Daily Mail and have been lucky enough thus far to avoid its online incarnation. That said, I do know that they are prone to whipping up nonsense stories about comics (Stewart Lee had this happen over his infamous Top Gear joke that satirized the show, rather than actually calling for the death of Richard Hammond). I did read the article, however, as well as seeing a brilliant Stewart Lee joke on the topic where, in an effort to reclaim the anger that Boyle talked about, he raged about coffee.

I have heard Boyle's joke though. And I thought it was crude, distasteful and, above all, lazy. There was nothing outside the mainstream about it. Indeed, it is the type of joke that your friend's loud and unwelcome friend might tell an unamused audience at the pub. 

Regarding your coupling of Boyle's and Hicks' names, I can only caution you that before you do so, you should listen to some of Hicks' material. If you have, and you still have not changed your view that they are producing the same type of material, then I have to tell you that you have not understood it. 

I direct you in particular to his last ever recorded show in 1993 at Igby's  - it is available on youtube. He died 3 months later.

It is impossible to listen to his shows when he is basically pleading with the audience to listen to him, to throw off the shackles of the everyday existence in which we find ourselves, to 'evolve ideas' and embrace what he saw as our true nature. 

Here is part of his 'just a ride' bit: "" It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money. A choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as ONE. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year, and instead spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many times over, not one human being excluded, and we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.""

His material is framed by his sincerely held libertarian and humanist beliefs. His routines contained material about events, like Waco, that profoundly moved and influenced him. The documentary about his life, American: the Bill Hicks story, will give you some insight into the type of individual he was and the way in which he brought himself to the audience not in a cynical posture but in the persona of the 'outlaw' comedian. This persona was a conflagration of the events of his childhood, his religious background, his deep love for his fellow man but fear that people would just remain satisfied with 'the ride', and his experience of rejection as a comic in the US which forced him to go to the UK, only to return a hero. 

Hicks' beliefs were sincerely held. The same may be true for Boyle, but I have the feeling that sincerely believing that a disabled boy had to be prevented from assaulting his mother is somewhat less noble.

All his money isn't the state's, for them to choose how much he can keep. It is *his*. Tax avoidance comes in a variety of different forms. You are avoiding tax when you get a buy one get one free in the supermarket. Is that wrong? Probably not, because you say so. But but, all those supermarket shoppers who gleefully fill their baskets with tax avoiding products used society, we should probably get on a moral pedestal and lambaste those people. 

Maximising the money you have is normal, and not immoral. Not any more immoral than asking for a pay rise, or seeking out a bank account with a higher rate of interest, or buying cigarettes and beer in a duty free. You might not like him avoiding tax, but to equate your likes and dislikes to morals with no real substantiation is laughable. Maybe I think it's immoral that you don't give away all your money above 10k. Why am I wrong?

I think this series hasn't been good. Moffat was a really good at writing individual episodes within a larger story arc, eg. Blink. And that larger story arc was what made Doctor Who especially good in my opinion. For example, the Christopher Ecclestone series had the BAD WOLF arc, where every episode eluded to bad wolf and the last two episodes really set up, explored and ended the series. 

I think that's what this last series has been lacking. Nothing is explored properly and as each episode is individual, there's no time to explore the events or really get involved.

The intelligence's weapon, Clara, managed to wipe away most of the information on the Doctor. Clara was an innocent girl until she got uploaded. Also, the symbiotic link the intelligence has with the man in Victorian London - forgetting his name - means his soul is also captured. He'll be able to reappear but it won't be the same man, more like a copy, similar to how Clara has been reappearing. The intelligence has a thirst for information on the Doctor and the doctor's memories seem to be a recurring theme - the power of them on akhaten, the library in the tardis and tonight, the fight for them with the cyber planner. The Doctor hides more than just his name, it's speculated that he is The Other, a time lord who worked with Rassilon and Omega, one with great power. If The Intelligence could duplicate him, it could create the Valeyard, the evil incarnation of The Doctor that aims to destroy him.

Media bias isn't particularly a problem unless it's widespread - in which case it's a consensus rather than a bias. And indeed the problem with the BBC is that it is supposed to be impartial, and you can't disseminate information without being partial, unless all you're doing is compiling a reference book. As soon as you start to give information shape and form you will distort it.

The BBC doesn't tend to invite the cranks RT specialises in - though to the Beeb's credit I've seen a number of interviews with leading figures of the BNP and EDL, and I suspect if there were a serious hard left in this country they'd give them airtime. I thought their handling of Nick Griffin's appearance on Question Time did them a lot of credit despite pressure not to give him a platform.

true,mateogg,tennant,Tennant,"I've thought about this, here's an answer I came up with, not saying its true, but I like it:

Why *a book*?

*  the Doctor certainly doesn't need it to remember, his brain is too powerful to need such primitive external memory support. 

* Even if he did, he has much better ways of storing and distributing information. Books for him are probably much more primitive than cave paintings are for us.

I think the answer is this: the Doctor is a bibliophile. We've seen his love for books before, The best example is when he goes with Donna to the library. Its not about storing or transmitting information. Its just about books. They are nice. Pretty. *Quaint*

Books are obsolete for Time Lords. If they ever wrote in books, the probably don't anymore. Who knows if the Doctor ever *wrote* in gallifreyan. The Gallifrey Encyclopedia from that episode is an example of how far ahead in information technology Time Lords were.

So the Doctor loves books. He loves to read them and apparently, he writes too. But not in gallifreyan. That doesn't make much sense, does it? I'm not saying he just writes in english, but maybe he writes in languages of civilizations that use books.

A bad analogy: haikus. Whenever I read a haiku in english, I just don't get it. The medium is not meant for that language. It just doesn't feel right.

I think that, if the Doctor writes books, its because its a hobby or an art, not for practical reasons. Maybe some day he wakes up (or not, since he doesn't sleep) and says ""huh, I kinda feel like writing a prose poem in mandarin today"" and he will. The book is not a tool, its just the result of an artistic excersise. 

Now, why write about the Time War of all things? Because its therapeutic. Think about how scarred nine was. He clearly has some issues regarding the War, and maybe putting them in writing helps him deal with it.",0,1368307575,null,0,false,0,c9wxm18,t3_1e55cf,t1_c9wxm18,t3_1e55cf,null,1431224946,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The increase in the value of a home also assumes that the increase is natural according to the market. Location is not the only thing that affects property prices. The house could have been a run-down shithole he got from a property auction, which he could have renovated/developed to double it's market value.

A new left back is definitely needed. Shaw is young, quick and improving all the time. Maybe a new Bale? 

We also need cover on the wings and Scott Sinclair would be a cheap backup winger, who could do a job for us when injuries and rotation arise. We all know we need a striker, Benteke and Bony are 2 great options to fit in the style of play. I like De jong, a young goal scoring midfielder who would be a better Dempsey.

I also think if we shifted Adebayor, Gallas and Dempsey we could even maybe fund a move for Gonzalo Higuain. A lot of talk aabout him moving on this summer.

They have to inform the press and PR departments as to who will still be playing the doctor in 2014.

true,calgil,judoon,Judoon,"The Doctor has pretty much given up the idea that Clara is the same as those other versions (just before jumping off the cliff in 'Journey', I believe). I understand there might be some residual feelings if there really were feelings back then, I suppose. It's not that it wouldn't make sense, just I personally hope they don't pursue a romantic angle any more (at least, not yet?), and the comments in this episode were just another step towards that. 

I could understand a couple of hundred years of being Cyberman-prepared...but 1000 years? I understand this could be handwaved by the Empire being a very long, very stable, futuristic regime. We don't have anything like that on Earth right now so it's hard to say whether information and 'mentality' would stick around for 1000 years. It is just a little hard to believe though. I think it would be more believable if the Cyberman were treated like the White Walkers from GoT. Sure there are stories which suggest the Walkers DID exist a long time ago...but by the time they reappear, they've been gone so long that they've essentially fallen into myth. Human nature is to move on, and move away from old fears. It would be akin to, in Westeros, having a 'White Walker Unit' within the Crows, and White Walker specific weapons always kept handy, after 1000 years or more. Eventually you just start to forget, and these old protocols accrue dust. If that presumption is rebutted, then I think we need to be shown MORE of the ever-ready mentality rather than just, 'oh lucky we still have these weapons here, amirite?!' (sorry for the stretched analogies if you're not a GoT fan)

Also I understand the need to set up the next episode, and towards the end of the episode I was looking forward to something like that. But all he did was repeat something he's said many times before - 'impossible girl'. Nothing new. What would I have preferred instead...maybe yet another accidental-Clara reference to something she shouldn't know, or a glimpse of River realizing she has to go to Trenzalore...maybe asking for a bit much, but I just think this was another case of Moffat hammering the same old catchphrase and motif instead of finding interesting ways to present the same mystery.",0,1368312776,null,0,false,0,c9wz1he,t3_1e4yiu,t1_c9wz1he,t1_c9wx8c7,null,1431224271,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

This is the building with the 8 on the door, then go to the second floor and it will be the second door you come to when going up from the stairs. The point if it that it does not require any numbering on doors, it ""just works"". 

Similarly 2FR means go to second floor and when going up from the stairs it is the door on the right. This should only be used when there are two doors per floor, hence 2F2 is the better standard. 

8/6 means the 6th door you come to from coming in the main door and then going up the stairs. This requires continually keeping count though.

Of course, there are blocks built by people with no clue on the Edinburgh standard so they put numbers on doors that follows some other pattern, if at all. 

BTW ever tried to do addresses around about the High Street etc? Now *that* is messed up.

That said I would be happy to have mailboxes on the ground floor. Why do we need to make someone walk all the way up every block when everyone is going down anyway?

The killing of the puppy is an interesting story in there too. Of all his diaries I think the Congo one is the most interesting as he talks about the failure of the revolution out there. And a quote I like from the Latin American Diaries that is the main mention of Fidel Castro.

I think as nice as it would be to get a big name striker I dont really see the need for one. Bony would be more than capable and I would still like to see Adebayor play with someone who is an actual challenge to his position.  Marin because although he has got little to no opportunities at Chelsea I still think he would play great with sigg &amp; bale. Two inside forwards who can move around and swap with the bombing left backs and a decent creative midfielder in Erikson. Facundo is great youth prospect at 22 and hitting his strike for Velez IRL not just FM13.

My thoughts anyway. No big money striker with to much pressure and a massive wage package. Our midfielders are going to grow and be the best in the league next year with tons of rotation chances.

true,glymph,null,null,"Thanks for taking the time to start this thread, the Edinburgh flat numbering systems are confusing and inconsistent and I take my hat off to the people who deliver our mail and everything else.

My door has my name and:

3F1
8/7 Street Street

...or something similar. The buzzer has the ""3F1"" format, so I tend to use that for anything I can (in case someone who is delivering a letter that needs signing for has to ring my buzzer), but certain institutions insist on using the numbering scheme in the post code database, which has the ""8/7"" format for my flat, and many websites only have this. Where I can, I put ""Flat 3F1"" on the line above that or in the Dominos pizza ""extra information"" field.

To add to the confusion, some flats use a single number in the post code database, and others use a 3-alphanumeric reference. There doesn't seem to be any consistency to it - I could understand if the council had one thing and the post code database had another, for example.

What's even worse is when flats are combined or split-up, as happened when I lived in Fowler Terrace a couple years ago - flat number 1 became PF1 and PF2, but I was in the next flat, so I went from ""Flat 2"" to ""PF3"" without moving, and everyone else in the block is probably now being forced to increment their number, because the landlady of the two ""new"" flats wouldn't consider something like ""1A"" and ""1B"" for the two rebuilt dwellings.

The best example of the confusion this can lead to is that when I moved into my current flat, I kept getting letters from my gas supplier saying I'd arranged to switch even when I hadn't - turned out they were getting me confused with the flat next door.",0,1368315605,null,0,false,0,c9wzt36,t3_1e4rz6,t1_c9wzt36,t3_1e4rz6,null,1431223909,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

Agree with the idea that Criscito could be a younger and potentially better Coentrao. I like the looks of Muriel, exciting player me thinks but sure Higuain would do. Sterling has some amount of potential as well but it would be a risk and thats if Liverpool would even think of selling him which is unlikely. Bony looks a realistic target too and wouldn't mind having him if the price was right.

true,armchairdetective,null,null,"At last, the thing becomes clear!

It appears that I have not understood what we did not agree on! What you seem to be saying is that these two comedians are equivalent because: a) they both do the same job b) they both have people who pay to see them c) they are both pandering to their audience. 

We also seem to disagree on what it means to be part of the mainstream and what it means to be outside it. If I understand you correctly, you seem to be saying that as long as a certain amount of individuals agree with you/are willing to listen to you, you are not an outsider.

Regarding the first point, I disagree that all comedians pander to their audience/tell their listeners what they want to hear. This may be true of some but it would mean that comedians follow their audience rather than the other way around. This is, of course, ludicrous. There is of course a complex interplay between the performer and the audience, as material is tested and worked and re-worked before it becomes locked in to an act. However, to pretend that the material is not (in most cases) a fundamental expression of the performer is akin to saying that an author considers what the public will want to read before s/he puts pen to paper. Artists and performers frequently talk about a feeling of 'needing to get something out'; meaning that their material comes from within rather than without (though, of course, it is generally a personal reaction to external events).

As to the second point, your assertion that the moment a group comes together it cannot be considered as being composed of outsiders *because there are several of them* is, frankly, silly. Throughout history, there have been groups that have been sizeable *and* in opposition to the status quo. 

You can think of examples like hippies etc. But also fundamentalist sects that spring up from major religions such as Catholicism, and even a group like the Manson Family. To say that Charles Manson was mainstream because he found people to support him would plainly be ludicrous. 

Finally, there is a distinction within comedy between the mainstream and those outside; this is where the term 'alternative comedy' comes from. Therefore, comedians themselves arrange themselves (and their audiences) into different factions. It is also worth noting that not every comedian tries to claim an alternative label (possibly because they realise that sexist, race-based, disability-based, spice rack-based etc jokes are not exactly challenging the status quo). 

I think that covers everything!

TL;DR: something is not mainstream just because it finds an audience.

I went to college for three years prior to University, which got me a BTEC in Software Development (read: Microsoft Office and Java) that I got a DistinctionMM level in.

Yes, the kids were annoying but I forgot about them most of the episode. I think it was just the writers' attempt at making this ""kids show"" somewhat relatable to kids and parents. Hence, the cell phone joke, the being unappreciative of going somewhere awesome. It was cheap but I get why they did it.

Yeehaw indeed. 

I would suggest you leave well and good alone but no doubt you'll mistake this as a invitation for a retort due to you're arrogant nature.

Britain for example mapped the genome, invented the measurements for time and navigation, invented penicillin, radar, the jet engine to name a few. The US on the other hand created the revolver (an idea stolen from the french by the way) the A-bomb (A german idea), video games and bubble gum.

[Theory](#s ""The Cyber-Planner personality possessing the Doctor in this episode, referred to henceforth as Mr. Clever, would have tremendous potential for making a return. Though the planet was destroyed and Mr. Clever was shorted out and removed from Eleven, in the final moments as the emperor's ship flies away, we see some floating cyber tech begin to flash. If we take this to mean that Mr. Clever survived, it's the perfect venue for his eventual return, but in a very specific way.
Suppose that during their time connected, Mr. Clever backed up or stored enough the Doctor's memories and 11's personality that he remains as we saw him, in terms of personality and knowledge. What if a few years from now, when he have the inevitable 12th doctor, Mr. Clever returns, in either a cyber body or human host that it's modified to LOOK and SOUND just like 11, and have Matt Smith briefly return to play the role in that story line. Maybe he's reconstructed the Doctor's erased history from the hole and memories he copied, as he implies during the chess game.
Sorry if this comes off as spit-balling too much. I just thought Matt's performance while he was Mr. Clever was amazing and I'd love to see more of it. And to see Matt Smith playing off whoever twelve winds up being would be a sight to see. Any thoughts on this? Was that stinger in the final moment just meant to be a the cybermen will return deal or could it be implying that Mr. Clever survived?"")",0,1368324733,null,0,false,0,c9x28pw,t3_1e5uev,t1_c9x28pw,t1_c9x25in,null,1431222690,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It's not an easy system to almost instantly alert someone of a goal, however watching a slow-motion replay is very easy. Soccer you do not have the time to watch a slow-motion replay, the ball could be on the other side of the field within 5-10 seconds.

Extremist alien law enforcers show up to catch the shapeshifting alien, but they can't detect the criminal because they've assumed human form. The Doctor needs to find the criminal quickly because the extremist law enforcers have put a whole bunch of innocent people at risk. In a final confrontation at a hospital (where the alien is hiding because it provides them with easy access to the resources they need for shapeshifting), it looks like the Doctor has failed because the shapeshifter has mimicked human form and evaded detection. But then the Doctor tricks the shapeshifter into assuming an alien form and the extremist law enforcing aliens are able to detect the shapeshifter and arrest them.

He uses his sonic screwdriver to amplify it, then uses it on the side of his face with the implants, killing off the cyberman part of himself. There's still the problem of the millions of cybermen though. They still have the bomb, but don't have the remote to start it. It's mentioned that it has a voice activated backup to arm it, but the problem is that the captain was dead. Then it's brought up that the Emperor's voice would surely be set to work. The girl reveals that she's figured out that Porridge is actually the Emperor. He is reluctant to start the timer for it since he's enjoying being incognito, and the moment he triggers it, his people will know where he is, and they'll transport him and everyone around him to his throne room on his flagship. He doesn't want to have to go back to being Emperor. But he starts the timer anyway, and everyone is magically whisked away to safety (Doctor mentions to have the Tardis also whisked away to wipe out a potential plot hole).

Since back then there was less division between the Crown and the state than today, they simply had the courts look at which royal land grants were functionally grants for the public good and which were grants for private use.  

They decided in the first 10 years that all royal grants of private right to waterways were null and void, that navigation was a public good.  And they decided that some tracts of undeveloped land would become public parks.  Otherwise, private leases of royal lands simply were rolled over to full ownership deeds.  

They had a constitution preventing ex post facto laws, which made going back in time and judging what was or wasn't the equivalent of Crown land land impossible.  So I guess it's technically possible that one could go back in time and judge what is or isn't Crown land.  But it's probably not advisable.

I was sent an article on Friday that said they got an actor for the 50th special to play the *real* ninth doctor, that Eccleson/Tennant/Smith had forgotten due to some sort of PTSD from the Time War, so *technically* Smith would be the 12th doctor if this is true.

*EDIT* Just as indiceiris said, the actor for the *real* 9 is John Hurt.

You need to NEED to see your heroes triumph, not merely survive. You need to NEED to see them realize their hopes and dreams, not just win a fight.

If you told a computer you were going to beat it in tic tac toe the computer would laugh at you because a computer is capable of computing every possible move in tic tac toe (hell even a human can do this easily) and either winning or forcing a draw. Same deal with Chess. Chess is a bit more complicated but what the doctor was proposing was small potatoes for any computer system. Whether the doctor was certain or not makes no difference. If somebody tells me that they will win at tic-tac-toe against anyone with utter certainty it doesn't mean that they are right.

The fact that everything always get solved in such a short time makes it seem like the stakes are much lower, and therefore less dramatic.

Also, I feel a change in the writing style too.  For example, some episodes... you can tell they came up with the title first and then wrote the story around a title, instead of starting from the story. (E.G. Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe)

I never saw the original three Doctor Who episodes.

They more than raised the money for their goal, and then reneged on it and even canceled Doctor Who for us. They even canceled Red Dwarf, Dark Shadows, Blake's Seven, and other BBC shows. I had to hunt down some BBC VHS tapes from flea markets, garage sales, and stuff to catch up on some stuff, but I could not find the original Three Doctor episodes.

I paid for a Netflix subscription because someone told me it had Doctor Who episodes, but only for like 9, 10, 11 and not the others. I was sorely disappointed, it was like PBS all over again.

Midfield: We NEED NEED NEED cover for Sandro/Dembele. I like Jordy Clasie (6m) or Kevin Strootman (11m). Also, a player that could cover the wings would be great. Callum McManaman maybe? Wigan's going down so he'd be cheap and he's looked great recently. With him and Townsend as cover, our winger depth would be amazing.

Striker: The most pressing need. I wouldn't be surprised to see one of Defoe or Ade leave this summer, meaning we would need to bring in two. I'm a big fan of Wilfred Bony (10m), Alfred Finnbogason (3m), Jackson Martinez (14m), Benteke (not sure, heard he has a release clause) and Aubameyang (10m). Any two of those would be great.

1. The beautiful scenes where the Doctor argued with himself and the ""Cyber-Doctor"". It was quite distressing, seeing him bicker with himself and being all evil. Like in ""The Waters of Mars"" where he does the Time Lord Victorious speech, he's all drunk on power and incredibly evil for a moment. All those arguments in the episode were incredibly ominous and powerful.
2. The way the BBC chose to make the interior of his mind look, with all the flying about of the circular Gallifreyan text. It was well done and visually stunning. Also, it makes me wonder how the Doctor really thinks. Over time, he has been more human that Time Lord, full of compassion and an overwhelming urge to protect humans, while deep inside he really is an almighty Time Lord. 
3. The way the Doctor is attracted the Clara, yet he can't tell why. Just the pure angst really captivated me. Especially the scene where the cyber-doctor tries to fool Clara and how he gets really close to her face, I was honestly expecting a kiss (and I was let down. Cries fangirl tears). I like how he absolutely adores her, and doesn't know who she is, and is trying to figure out who he is, and how he hates not being in control of his love towards her.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;If we want to live in a democratic society, surely 'capitalism' is a natural extension of democracy?

Actually quite the reverse.  Democracy almost inevitably eventually leads to socialism.  It's the exact reason that the founding fathers of the US set it up as a republic and explicitly decided that they had to protect the wealthy from the likely consequences of ""too much"" democracy.  All that shit from Franklin about two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch was just a coded way of saying that the poor will always vote not to be poor any more and there are more of them.  If you want to protect wealth you have to restrict the franchise and/or befuddle, confuse and keep ignorant the masses.  You can see this on so many levels today - from that UKIP woman's stupid comments about only letting the employed vote, to the pushing of crappy religious or corporate-led education, to the neo-liberal agenda being relentlessly pushed through every aspect of culture.

&gt;And, if we're to compete as notably some of the world best, most important financial services then we cannot slash profits off, funds that are then reinvested into the banks themselves that drive growth, because this is what other nations are doing.

I'll need a translation of this.

&gt;We can't stop international trade.

We could if we wanted to, but I'm not arguing for this.  And besides, trade and capitalism ARE NOT THE SAME THING!  Capitalism is a system of ownership, property and privilege, trade is markets.

&gt;So, socialism can't work

But it does, very well in so many areas of life and in many parts of the world.  In some ways, the world is more socialist now than at any point in its history.  You know those California high tech start ups which were innovating so much around the turn of the millennium?  Most of them were effectively communist.  Shocking huh?

&gt;it's just a flawed hypothesis

Is it?  Care to provide any evidence or is this just a pub assertion?

&gt;our international competitiveness would drop, it'd be expensive to do business in the UK and unemployment would rise significantly. 

The first true thing you've said.  It's hard to do socialism in a capitalist world where all the cards are stacked for big wealthy transnational corporations.  To some extent it's also hard to do socialism in a free market (the antithesis of capitalism if you like), where ruthless competition is the norm, because socialism is focussed on cooperation and sharing rather than competition and hoarding.  This is why socialism is generally internationalist.",0,1368340810,null,0,false,0,c9x62c6,t3_1e3awy,t1_c9x62c6,t1_c9x5ofl,null,1431220889,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Tardis is a framing device it's something that allows a Story in ancient Rome one week and a story in current day london the next. Since it's been heavily included it is generally like boom Time fixed things.

Keynesianism is a right wing economic position for example, just not as right wing as Monetarism or Austrian economics (Austrian is  bit of a weird case though, since they actually share many characteristics of Marxists which is why there seems to be a lot of traffic between the two).

My fiance and I had a conversation about this a while back and we feel like Moffat is sort of doing what Lucas did for the star wars prequels.  In both cases talented people completely misunderstood what made their product good.  Moffat wrote some of my favorite episodes, but when he became head-writer I feel like he lost the soul of what made his episodes so good and focused on the outer trappings. ""Oh!  We have a bigger budget, that means we can do more explosions/chase scenes/big cinematic views!"" ""This is a show about time travel! That means infinite plot twists!""

Sure, sci-fi writers make jumps, but they should at least abide by their own rules. Moffat, in general, does, whereas most of the time I felt Davies didn't even care.

To give one example, there's *Tooth and Claw*. Okay, the werewolf was trained and conditioned to dislike mistletoe oil, and the doors to the library are treated with it, so the werewolf can't come in. Those are the rules. So the werewolf crashes in through the ceiling! Okay, but if they leave the library, the werewolf will be trapped inside... but it's not. No explanation. Nothing.

(There's also the blatant implausibility. Okay, the diamond focuses the moonlight. Well, refracts it. Okay, so it reflects it somehow. And it's shaped specifically to do that! ...from the ground. So it can hit the werewolf if they're lucky enough to have it standing at *precisely* the right position when the diamond is thrown *precisely* at the right spot... again, on the ground. And it was! Victory.)

Besides, Davies relied on at least a partial reboot in *Utopia*/*The Sound of Drums*/*Last of the Time Lords*, and the only comprable reboot from Moffat I can think of at the moment is *The Pandorica Opens*/*The Big Bang*. If you're counting the Doctor deleting himself from history, Nine deleted himself from the internet, so there's that. Maybe it's a matter of scale, which is a fair point, but it's not without precedent.

In what way are you suggesting socialism restricts business?

&gt;If we want to put laws down now, saying every employee is entitled to a share of the profits, international companies who are looking to produce things here and create jobs will just go elsewhere. 

Socialism is when the workers own and control the business.  There are many examples of successful companies where this is happening.  When such companies are run well they can out-compete and out-perform capitalist companies.  What is better is that they have in-built protections against polluting, outsourcing, health and safety violations etc. and you don't get the insane disparities of income between the shop floor and the boardroom.  Think about it, if you ran your own company, would you outsource your job or relocate your factory to Bangladesh?  Also, I don't subscribe to [the vacuous idea that wealthy capitalists ""create jobs""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=CKCvf8E7V1g).

&gt;there's no need to live in fairyland thinking that a concept like 'socialism' can make our lives better and create a better society, it simply can't.

Well, speak for yourself.  Personally, I'd rather live in a society without bosses, with a more equitable distribution of natural resources and shitty work, where nobody gets a free ride because of the family they were born into and nobody is denied access to the things that make life wonderful.  I'd rather we used technological advancements and abundant energy to move towards freedom and plenty for all than towards a slave society based on privilege.

&gt;Let's be realistic, it cannot work. 

Let's be realistic, we can do better than capitalism.  Sure we have to learn from past mistakes, because we can do a lot worse than the status quo, but there are many many ways things could be improved, both at home and globally.

Fidel didn't really take credit for Che's work, he sent him to do certain things and Che did them. What Fidel did was support Che in his idea to spread the revolution around the world, he wanted to go to Argentina and start one there. They had people there waiting and the leader waiting for Che was killed. So off to the Congo he went. This had to be kept secret, and he was missed in Cuba, he wasn't on the podium for the 26th July celebrations, rumours were around that he was dead or in prison. Fidel was left with very little choice but to tell the country and the world where he was.

The thing that Fidel did that was interesting is using those that died to further the revolution, there is no real cult of personality around Fidel like there was for Stalin, Mao, Hitler.

I also hate the general right wing political assumption that our country is overrun by foreign scroungers, which is backed up by the shrieking right wing media, like the daily mail.

Of the people I know in the UK who are engaged with politics the response to UKIP is largely one of fear. However, UKIP themselves are not really a threat to anything, it's the panicked reactions of the parties which actually do have power that's worrying.

UKIP party activists (aka ""kippers"") have a tendency emit opinions along the lines of ""homosexuality leads to paedophilia (and/or bestiality)"" or that ""Afro-Caribbean people get more schizophrenia because they smoke a lot of weed"".

Look no further than Cold War and Crimson Horror though if you want to see how a great story can be rushed into a big let down. Two part stories are an integral part of the Doctor Who story arc each season. It slows down the pace of the show in order to present the viewer with depth and detail, and series 7 is SEVERELY lacking depth.

We are already at the eve of the finale and I really don't feel like the mystery of Clara or the Great Intelligence has advanced, twisted, or surprised me at any point. I think that is due to each episode having to be rushed along to fit everything for that story into the 43 minute time span. Doctor Who NEEDS two part episodes.

Clara is a TARDIS.

This correlates with the fact that the TARDIS does not like Clara. The Doctor's Tardis thinks that Clara might try to take the Doctor away from her. Additionally, In Nightmare in Silver, the Doctor describes Clara as being in ""a dress that's too tight"". This would be a perfect metaphor for Clara, as being a Tardis inside a Tardis should be a relatively tight fit. This also could explain why in the preview for the finale she says ""I was born to save the Doctor"". She was a Tardis literally grown to save the Doctor.

true,DiscoDonkey,eng-westmidlands,Birmingham,"Your figure of £50 million per day seems very skewed, and it definitely shows that you are a UKIP supporter. [Here's](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union) how much we spend in a year to the EU, now if we work out the daily spending for that we end up with £38 million (when rounded) per day, you may say that's not a big difference but your figure adds a whole £4.38 billion per year. Just to show you I'm not just picking and choosing figures from leftist news sources here's the [Telegraph's](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9643193/EU-budget-who-pays-what-and-how-it-is-spent.html) reporting on EU spending. What I particularly like about THAT article is that not only does it show that the true cost of the EU for the UK is €4.89 billion (£4.13 billion pounds) per year, which shows that the EU actually costs us £11 million per day. It also shows that our net spending into the EU is significantly lower than Germany's, yet Germany has the largest economy in Europe and has maintained its AAA rating, despite using the Euro, despite being at the heart of Europe. Clearly, then it isn't Europe that's causing us trouble.

Your point that 
&gt;EU law recently ruled we should close our coal power stations

Is completely bogus.  In this [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/9963385/Coals-final-chapter-is-not-yet-written.html) it says that coal power stations were given the oppourtunity to either clean up or close, there is no forcing anyone to do anything. The case study they give is actually from an E.On owned power station which is a German based company so realistically we did not own that power station, it was not state funded and it closed because E.ON saw it as cheaper than cleaning it up. Basically, the power plants cosed to protect the pockets of business men and not because of some vendetta the EU has against the UK.

Then you say that we should be all or nothing in our approach to membership of the EU, saying we should either be completely in or completely out. This seems deluded that you think that something like this could happen overnight. Integration takes time, there are currently 23 languages in the EU, if there was just one integration would be easier, not to mention the completely different cultures of different countries. An English person has very little in common with your average Polish person.

Finally, the point that I enjoy the most, 
&gt;update our nuclear capabilities and make sure we have a strong armed forces at our disposal

Net military spending according to [this website](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_2003_2015UKb_12c1li111mcn_31t) is at around £33 billion per year and rising. We don't get any of that money back, and you want to increase that figure?? Tell me what benefits does having a large army bring to the people living in the UK, please I want to hear it because aside from creating jobs (from which many are being laid off) I can't see the benefit of having a costly army for your everyday person in the UK. Then costing us tens of billions of plans in upgrading our nuclear capabilities, which will just sit on submarines and in silos, is just ludicrous. Look at all of the countries that havent been nuked who don't have nukes, it's just fear mongering, we are not in the Cold War anymore they are not needed. Instead, if we fear for the safety of our citizens from foreign powers, how about spending money building up nuclear defences and making sure we could actually survive a nuclear strike from a nation. Or, better yet don't put us at risk by fighting wars that we aren't involved with?

The idea that the EU is causing all of our problems is just wrong, examples like Germany show us that the EU isn't an impacting figure at all on an economy and growth can still be enjoyed, even when your currency is failing. We must look to areas within our own economy if we want to break free from spiralling debt and not just rely on scapegoats like the EU. I sincerely hope the the referendum votes yes to leaving the EU in 2015 just so people like you can see that it wouldn't fix anything.

Not really.

The company has only just turned a profit of £23 million in 2012 after posting years of losses -- such as a loss of £120 million in 2011, and much of the turnaround was thanks to the nationalisation of the pension liabilities so that the company no longer has that cost burden.

Most people analysing the company would say that it is quite inefficient compared to how postal services are run in other countries.

So, you have an inefficient company that has generally lost money and can only make a profit thanks to taxpayer subsidy of its pension costs.

Striker situation obviously needs addressing. Wouldn't be opposed to selling Defoe and Ade and completely revamping our strikeforce. 

Think we could use another left back, although wouldn't be utterly opposed to trying Rose as our starter there next season. Although if there's a chance Luke Shaw moves this window we should be all over that.

Also think we could use another wide player, ideally someone who could play as a wide man in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3. Townsend helps in the former but I'm unconvinced he can be the latter. Son would be ideal.

Hopefully we get to see a few players move on this season and AVB really build the side more into a team of his own making.

Parker, Huddlestone, Adebayor, BAE, Bentley, Jenas, Gallas

Don't get me wrong: This confusion is painful. I am OCD when it comes to these things and felt much better when I moved to a flat in a new tenement that had numbers on the doors, no discussion here. But you cannot blame the people living there.

I agree with your suggestion that tenants could make an effort and put the numbers on their doors. That will not solve the confusion, but make your job easier.

Also, our postie in Perth Street, on occasional days, would just dump anybody's mail in the hallway. Not cool.

Finally, living in Germany now, people have their name on the letter box. This has two great advantages:
1. No confusion about numbers and shit.

-If you like going out for a drink then spend a night going up and down the different bars on Waterloo Street and then pick either a 'chicken box' from a takeaway or a pizza from Paolos (their pepperoni is the best). Derry has a better pub atmosphere than club atmosphere.

-In the mornings find one of the bakery chain Dohertys and buy the following: Turnover, Sausage roll bap and chocolate gravy ring. It'll clog your arteries but the stuff is excellent.

- Find a drink called Football special. Only certain corner shops have it in stock (Its from Donegal and is like medicine)


- Seriously walk around the walls. Even if you don't want to go on a walking tour. If you take your time it can kill an hour or two plus some of the views are great. And don't be afraid of walking about the estates around it like the Bogside or Fountain. 


-A lot of restaurants in the city offer ridiculous deals ie 33% off. Keep in mind that most places serve very similar food so you never miss out going one place over another.


-The museum in the middle of town is really good if you want a concise history of the place; partially because it's small. 


-If at any point you're getting a taxi from one part of town to another, the fare will never ever ever be anymore than £5. Taximen will talk non stop to you if you want, but they can bump up fares if they know you're from out of town. Most people in Derry use taxis over public transport as well.

true,TheEphemeric,null,null,"Sorry for the long and slightly rambling post but Chelsea has a very exciting and turbulent history, so I feel a certain amount of detail is necessary!

Founded in 1905 in a very fashionable part of London, essentially because they wanted a team to represent the neighbourhood, won promotion to the top division in English league football after only two years. Chelsea developed a reputation for being quite a glamorous team and signing big name players, but no real success until the 1950s when the club won their first ever league title, and became the first English club to qualify for European competition (which our club owner had been instrumental in developing, however the football league ultimately barred us from competing as they didn't like the idea of European competition).

After that the club faded a bit until the 1960s and 1970s when the club became very trendy and fashionable with a number of celebrity fans, and went on to enjoy a fair bit of cup success including our first ever FA Cup and our first European trophy the Cup Winners Cup.

The late 1970s and 1980s saw the low point in the club's history when we got relegated to the lower league and found ourselves wracked by financial troubles due to ambitious stadium developments (the rise of a mini 'Chelsea Village' around our stadium Stamford Bridge). Then came along a man called Ken Bates who bought the club for the princely sum of £1 and returned us to stability.

The real turning point for Chelsea came in the 1990s, with the club now on sound financial footing thanks to the steady stewardship of owner Bates and the backing of millionaire and lifelong Chelsea fan Matthew Harding, which paved the way for the appointment of Glenn Hoddle, a massive star, as our player manager. This new look Chelsea went on to attract some of the greatest talent in Europe to the club like Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes, which later would lead to the signing of legends like Gianluca Vialli, Marcel Desailly and Gianfranco Zola, the last of whom is commonly considered the greatest ever Chelsea player (although Frank Lampard might have overtaken him recently). None of these coups would have been possible without the aforementioned backing of Matthew Harding, who following his tragic helicopter crash has had a stand at the stadium named after him.

This exciting spell in the 1990s saw Chelsea finally become a regular contender for honours, winning several domestic and european trophies in the later years of the decade, but in the early 2000s the club once again faced serious financial difficulties. In 2003 the entire existence of the club essentially came down to one game, the last game of the season against Liverpool. Win that game and we would qualify for the Champions League and claim the bumper cash pool qualification entails, but fail to win and the club would miss out, and likely go into administration, potentially meaning the end of the club. Chelsea did win the game, a late winner from Jesper Gronkjaer arguably saving the club.

It turned out this victory had even further significance, as qualification for Europe's elite competition spurred Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich to purchase the club outright, and begin a revolution that would completely change the face of European football, and result in Chelsea rising to become one of Europe's very best clubs. Which brings us to where we are today, in the years since Roman took over we've entered the most successful period of our club's history, gone on to win pretty much every trophy available, including our first ever league and FA cup double in 2010, and most notably our first ever Champions League just last year.

true,Boiiing,null,null,"&gt; I've heard about people having three exactly the same accounts (for example, three Lloyd’s current accounts with Vantage) and transferring the money about.

&gt;Surely if they have the same interest rate then it makes no difference compared to if it just stayed in the one account. 

The vantage accounts are high interest current accounts but like a lot of banks they want you to use them as your 'main account' to qualify for the benefits they come with. 

So you need to deposit a certain minimum into the account each month to actually get the high interest, and also have a couple of direct debits set up.

There is a maximum cap on the amount of cash balance they will pay interest on (this is a current account and not a savings product), so if you had 15,000 in one account it wouldn't all earn interest. However if you had 5,000 in each of 3 accounts, the 15,000 total could all earn interest. You need to ensure each of the accounts keep meeting the terms &amp; conditions to qualify for interest, so you need to keep putting money into the accounts. So people shuffle money between the accounts to keep them all active, without necessarily having lots of 'new' money introduced. And they end up with better overall rates than the top savings account. 

With other banks this doesn't always work - e.g. Nationwide's ""flex"" product and I think also Citi's, needs to have new money come in from another bank or a branch deposit to qualify as a main account and get the various exclusive benefits.

As mentioned by others this term of 'drip-feeding' in a savings context was generally for maximising your total interest by dripping in whatever maximum the high-earning account would take each month.

The dogma is that it's only violence when you break a Starbucks window...

People aren't being found not responsible for those deaths because the crimes were 'white collar' or 'running the system'. They're not responsible because we have hundreds of years of case law and statute establishing principles of causation and remoteness that are not even close to being met by these circumstances.

For example, if the Starbucks manager kills himself because people keep smashing up his business, the window smasher *will not* be responsible. If he goes and smashes up a bunch of other windows in anger, the window smasher *will not* be responsible.

Landlords compete on price and some do as little as possible to maintain the properties. I'd sooner see a scheme where if a landlord has a seriously below standard property where it's clear they've neglected their responsibilities the property is confiscated, the council bring it up to scratch and it becomes part of their housing stock.

Additionally BTL mortgages 6 months in arrears should be bought by councils with a bit of a discount - say 20% of market value. 

The other thing Osborne could do is dump his stupid new build scheme and instead match deposits for non-home owners by up to 10%. This will support the housing market and cause new builds to appear, and it'll help the chain.

Whatever is done, however, needs to be careful not to push rent prices up by much.

true,Fineus,null,null,"I can only answer from an IT industry point of view - otherwise - if we take a hypothetical candidate who has no academic skills, no experience in any industry and who hasn't worked in 5 years then I don't think applying through a recruitment agency would help them - they would be hard to employ in anything beyond basic roles requiring no key skills. 

From an IT point of view though, I would like to think that agencies can help. There is a distinction to make though: 

Is the person hard to place because they have very niche skills - but they do have skills? 

Or is the person hard to place because their skills are out-dated or not present? 

With the former - we will know companies that work with these niche skills that a person might not otherwise know. We can ""sell"" candidates into these companies even if they're not actively hiring - because we know they use these skills and that they're hard to come by. 

With the latter - we can suggest ways a person can improve or update their skill set but if someone has obviously not stayed current or is not as strong skilled as other candidates - we'll do what we can but in the end that's something every person has to worry about for themselves.

My advice to these people would be to keep your skills sharp and current. If you're staying with the same company for a long while then make sure they're training you in the latest technologies relevant to your work - make sure you're using them as well. At the end of the day we can make these suggestions but employers aren't so stupid that they won't pick up on you not having current skills relevant to the job on your CV. 

Speaking frankly (and making a generalization) - if you let your skills atrophy - you'll find a harder time finding new work.

true,Fineus,null,null,"I've found that CV's will differ depending on the *type* of job a person is applying to. 

An easy example is the difference between a Java application developer and a Web Developer. The former will have a very text based CV, the latter will be more likely to use a .PDF format and to make it more colorful / appealing to the eye. 

I will also mention that in my role I will actually 'bug fix' a persons CV if they have any glaring problems - correcting font sizes, formatting and so on. I won't ever add or remove content without a candidates consent but these minor changes are often essential in making a CV easily accessible and attractive. 

In general though I would suggest: 

* Make it easy to read. If I have to squint to see the text - or if it's a huge block of text - you aren't doing yourself any favors. 

* Pick a sensible font. Comic Sans MS is for children's projects, Times New Roman makes the document look old. Tahoma, Calibri and Arial are all acceptable choices. I'll change that for you if it's appropriate - but do yourself a favor and save us both the trouble. 

* Make it sensible and sane to follow. Think about what I *and* the employer want to see in your CV. Include all relevant information... 

* ...some people believe that sticking to 2 pages is essential for a CV. I've found this is only true in the case of graduates who generally have less information to include. For anyone else; *include the information* rather than worrying about document length. CV's of 3 to 6 pages length are fine provided you don't waffle and include exactly what you mean to include. 

* Include your contact details. Always. If I don't know where you're based or how to get in touch with you - the chances of me doing so drop dramatically.

* Play to your strengths; I want to know what you've done / where you've done it / who you did it with / how long you've done it for. 

* Search Engine Optimize your CV. The major job boards scan the profiles you give them and pick out the key words we search for. If you work with Java - make sure you mention it a lot - as well as any other technologies you work with that are relevant (Spring, Hibernate, J2ee etc.) 

In the end it's all about being sensible. Make it easy for the person reading your CV to read it. Don't assume we do or do not know anything. 

Does that help? Can I be more specific at all?

It's very hard to show that beyond reasonable doubt unless you have overwhelming evidence - frankly, you have to be quite stupid to leave that much evidence lying around.

Fraud is an offence based entirely on what's in your head - it's pretty close to a ""thought crime"" in that the exact same action can be fraudulent or not depending on what you're thinking. It's therefore a colossal waste of time and resources to try to prosecute without damning evidence.

Generally speaking, English law takes the view that financial matters should be taken care of through contract and civil law rather than criminal law.

The problem is that this requires a patent issuing authority that understands the fields in which they are permitting patents (and, generally, they do not with computing, I imagine it's similar with biotech), and that issues patents in pursuit of the above, which is also absolutely not happening.

true,littlesteelo,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I don't think the show has been good since the end of series 5. People have pretty much covered what I think of it in the other comments, but one point I will mention is regarding the companions.

They are becoming way too cocky and in-your-face. Clara is one of the worst for this, especially in the last episode. She seems to have an ego almost as big as Moffats, and the acting just seems really forced and awkward, like she is trying too hard to be 'quirky'.

Compare this with Rose in the first and second series (she got annoying later on) and you can see the difference straight away. She is just an ordinary person who travels with the Doctor, and there is a nice subtle story arc surrounding her in the second series (you will die in battle etc.). That was a really good way of putting it, since technically she does die. There was no deus ex machina, since the Doctor genuinely lost her. I would love to see Moffat try and make a series finale as good as Doomsday. 

Martha was slightly more annoying, but she still took a back seat to the main story, and the Doctor himself. Donna was much better, and is my favourite companion, since she was able to play both outrageous and emotional within the span of an episode. She is partially the reason series 4 is my favourite one.

Compare the RTD companions with the Moffat ones and it is obvious what the differences are. Right from the start it was all Amy Amy Amy, the girl who waited, blah blah blah. And just like Clara, she had a huge ego. She was no longer an ordinary character, but suddenly more important than the Doctor.

The same goes for Clara. The whole 'impossible girl' shite is the worst story arc in the new series. It isn't subtle, because it isn't really a story arc as such. Whereas the bad wolf and the Mr. Saxon arcs could be subtly introduced and hinted at, you just can't do this with someone who dies all the time. It feels like he is trying to do one story about Clara, but try and wedge in a Doctor Who series at the same time.",0,1368362153,null,0,false,0,c9x8olw,t3_1e54nz,t1_c9x8olw,t3_1e54nz,null,1431219654,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Owa1n,eng-Cornwall,DPRK,"There's nothing inherently wrong with genetic modification. There is a danger, with crops, that GM pollen may contaminate the crops of neighbouring farmers or that genes may 'escape' into the wild potentially creating uncontrollable weeds etc. depending on the characteristics of the genes.

These dangers can be reduced by eliminating the chance of cross-pollination by not modifying crops that will be flowering, although in reality there aren't so much crops that we can rely on to not flower. A better way would be to produce GM crops that don't flower.

The more worrying issue is the immorality of these large agrobusinesses such as Monsanto who carry out programmes with dire consequences for ecosystems, farmers and communities in poor countries.

Personally I think it's safer, environmentally to stay away from GM crops until mechanisms have been put in place to control the dangers. And it would be more ethical to stay away from GM crops until the power has been wrested from the hands of companies like Monsanto.

I'm currently a biotech student and it's scary how blindly pro-GM most of the scientific community are. They will scoff and dismiss anyone as hippies and tin-foil hat types for questioning genetic modification practices without realising that they pose a large risk to the environment and ignore the fact that GM crops have been used to enslave a lot of third-world farmers to huge debts leading to a boom in the amount of third world farmers committing suicide etc.",0,1368362395,null,0,false,0,c9x8pu6,t3_1e6e55,t1_c9x8pu6,t3_1e6e55,null,1431219639,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Another reason is its replacement, I'm pretty sure that because this skatepark is part of the community, after removing it, the local authorities should replace it with something of equal benefit to the community. The chances are they will say we will build you another skatepark that is about 20 miles away, where nobody can/wants to go.

And...

&gt;lower taxes

I live in Texas, and we don't even have a state income tax.

&gt;no huge NHS to pay for

We get free insurance through the husband's work, and I just purchase health insurance for my oldest boy through a private insurance company.  It is a lot cheaper than you would begin to imagine.

&gt;You can own guns

And this is a big one for us.  We not only carry guns for protection (not only against people, but being rural, we also have to deal with feral hogs, and once in a blue moon, we see something with rabies), but the husband and middle boy like to shoot for fun.  We just bought a ranch, and one of the higher ups on the list is to build a shooting range, where we don't have to worry about livestock getting hit.

But the flip side of it is that no matter where I was born into, I would have complied with the laws of that country.  Even here, people who fight the system too much can't get ahead.

In portions of the PL season as well, there was an appearance of ""if we hang around for ninety mins, we'll get a victory"". There were even a couple of fairly important games where as an outsider you wouldn't be able to tell it was an important game for the whole first half. 

Of course, this didn't apply to all players, but many of our big names coasted at times in the season, and we ended up losing games where we should have won. In fact, the only games I could think of where we were clearly outclassed were the Shaktar ones. Every other game we had our chances and lost marginally. Even the drubbing we got by Falcao we weren't outclassed, we just didn't put in a solid effort.

true,bluequail,null,null,"For us, it is.  My husband works for an exceptionally good employer, and by the 10 year mark, that employee and family get free insurance.  He starts picking up 50% of the cost by your 5th year with the company, and picks up an additional 10% a year until you reach the 10th year.  We pay $94/mo for coverage for my oldest boy, and his is pretty close to the same coverage that we have, only it has a $2 million max, where we have a $10 million max.  Oh, and he does not have, but we do have dental/vision coverage as well.

But I do recognize that we are lucky in that respect, and not everyone has such good coverage.  Sometimes it is a matter of what you would settle for.

Another thing, and you being there, I don't know if you can really understand.  But a lot of people just make a conscious choice not to buy insurance, or not to buy ""good"" insurance.  About a year and a half ago, maybe two years ago, there was a case on /r/assistance where a family sent their son to Hawaii (he went with friends as a part of a group)as a part of a graduation present.  While there, he broke one of the lower cervical bones in his spine.  They couldn't afford health insurance for him, but they could afford to send him on a $4000+ trip.  They could have covered him with health insurance for over 4 years for the cost of that trip, but chose to spend their money on fun things, instead of necessary things.  Heck, with the changes in the law, they could have covered him for free on their health insurance through their work, but chose not to do that.

For people who are truly poor, there is a state based healthcare coverage, it is called medicaid.  I know of a young lady that was hit by a car, and she had pregnancy medicaid, and she was in a coma in ICU (on a ventilator) for 11 weeks.  Because the accident terminated her current pregnancy, as soon as she was able to stay alive without the help of a machine, they sent her home, but her mom was able to get her on the regular medicaid, and they've admitted her back into the hospital.  But she legitimately qualified for this free medical.  It is there for people who are actually low income.

I can only feel so much sympathy for people (here in the US) who make a conscious choice not to purchase insurance, when they have the means to pay for it.  I get a little irritated when they complain about how bad it is, because it is available, but they decide that entertainment is more important than protecting their own health.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is pretty tedious. You've - for some reason - decided that people's tax is not an ethical issue - despite offering no actual logic to that effect (just repeating the mantra that people don't owe society anything, if they are abiding by the law then it is moral, except no abiding by the law is not the decider of what is moral wait what was your argument again?)

&gt; You cannot substantiate why tax should be at the level you think it should be, so you are in no position to say that someone who deems that they should pay 1% is wrong,

I can - just not as an exact % figure (i'm not an HMRC agent). The tax level should be what the democratically elected parliament *intends* the tax level to be - i.e. what society collectively establishes as fair. Parliament tries to create a legal framework to enact that but of course there are loopholes. When companies or people use the tax law and deviates from the intended framework it is unethical - because you are trying to pay less tax than 'society' intends you to - which is societies view on what is fair/ethical (the only relevant ethical view here). Of course there are plenty of cases where you can debate what the intended tax is supposed to be (IR35 for example, or Starbucks, or Google's UK operations) but in Jimmy Carr's case it is actually fairly straight forward deviation from what parliament intends. Strictly legal - well maybe (actually like a lot of stuff it is down to assessment by HMRC not a black and white rule) but insofar as it deviates from parliaments intentions therefore societies deemed 'fari' amount it is unethical. Nobody in parilament or HMRC would stand up and say that they created tax law intentionally to allow JC to use it in the way he has.

&gt; especially when their 1% actually equals more financially than your 30%.

Well i own a business so what tax I pay is not on par with a typical salaried person - but that's beside the point. The idea that someone pays more in cash terms means they are somehow more morally 'just' than another is daft. What are we saying that those that pay nothing are the worst offenders (despite having no money?) or that simply paying a bit more than - some magic number - makes everything OK. Like the business world typically treats services they sell, the more 'benefit' you get out of a service the more you contribute for it - e.g. model releases, TV broadcasting, selling businesses, selling houses etc etc - it is a well established principle. JC has benefited more from society than the average person (measured by earnings), he should contribute more to society. That is exactly how the UK tax law is designed, and its intended use.  

&gt; You seem to fail to understand that when you tax the rich and companies more, they just charge us more. We pay their taxes indirectly any way. 98% of FTSE 100 companies use tax havens in one form or another. Prices would escalate greatly, at our expense, and pension fund's expense.. The attempts to do so by charging 50% as Labour did only serve to push people toward aggressive tax avoidance schemes, who at 30% would probably have happily paid.

No i do understand that - i dont think we should be taxing people at 45 / 50% and I do think we need to keep corporation tax levels low to attract investment. I own a business - I do not want to be taxed more and I believe it would be counter productive. Case in point - non executive directors are now required to be taxed on a salary basis (instead of as a Ltd company consultant - which is very common) - the net effect is small companies find it more expensive to have NEDs and will drop them - bad news for small and medium sized businesses as strong boards are important. For the record much of this type of income is funnelled through Ltd companies - fair enough, but their basic tax rates should be paid. My business does - so do most people's. 

&gt;  It is next to impossible to raise taxes much above 35% of GDP

Well i believe the level is a bit higher than that anyway - but again - I would agree in the principal that keeping it low is good for the country (assuming we can spend less than our income).

An employee is repeatedly absent due to illness. Upon return to work, the employee notifies the employer that they were suffering from depression. The time is allowed as a reasonable adjustment on grounds of disability, as the employer is already aware of the employee's condition. During the welcome back discussions, the employee states that they are experiencing stress due to anxiety relating to a forthcoming promotion interview. They state that they have thought about killing themselves if they don't get promoted.

In that particular circumstance if the employer failed to refer the employee to occupational health, then it could be argued that they failed in their duty of care towards the employee. Employers have a duty of care towards their employees in the workplace even with regards to psychiatric harm.

With the pinko stuff I just meant that conservative Brits like to portray the Guardian as some kind of crypto- or soft-core socialist (or ""worse""), which surprises me because it seems an obviously liberal/social-democratic/center-left paper; nothing particularly socialist about it.

Re: your first paragraph though, I appreciate the point that we should keep in mind that all the mainstream media, parties etc buy into the current economic system - whether they want to soften it or harden it, they still subscribe to the basic underlying premises; and as such none of them are offering a systemic alternative. We don't disagree all that much, really. But I don't think that language works in such a way that you can therefore call them all right-wing and only, I dunno, the Morning Star left-wing. I mean, this basically gets into a semantic discussion, but left-wing and right-wing and variations like left-of-center, centrist, etc, are inherently relative terms. You can't *all* be right-of-center, not in the long run; that's kind of inherently counter to the meaning of the word. 

Parties, people, newspapers etc are left-wing or right-wing relative to their countries' political center, within their countries' given political landscape. Of course I also tend to scoff at anyone calling Obama left-wing, because America's liberals would be mere centrists at best in our countries' political landscapes, and Obama isn't even particularly liberal. His policies are comparable to those of the center-right in most of Europe. And such an international comparison can be useful to put things in perspective. But when, for a decade or two or more, in your country and across most of your continent, 90%+ of parties, politicians, media etc are all what you call ""right-wing"", you are kind of at war with language ... you know?",0,1368365988,null,0,false,0,c9x9a3e,t3_1e4fiw,t1_c9x9a3e,t1_c9x69di,null,1431219303,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,"Why?

Because Barroso’s federal europe is coming to a screen near you soon, starting with the soon to be economically converged eurocore, and that threatens our economic independence via caucused decision making managed by the ECB/EBU which is then foisted on the eurozone-outs.

To quote Gladstone:

“The finance of the country is intimately associated with the liberties of the country. It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired … It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison …That power can never be wrenched out of your hands… That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse – the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure – your main guarantee for purity – the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.”

Regarding caucused voting via the EBU:

“De jure incentives to take common position: This incentive is reinforced by the way the Commission’s ECB/EBA Regulations are currently drafted. For example:

• The ECB Regulation envisions the ECB acting as a coordinator of eurozone national supervisors, with the view for them to take a common position. The ECB has already dropped hints that it intends to actively discourage dissenting opinions amongst eurozone national supervisors.

• Through a eurozone caucus, some member states will indirectly boost their influence as their voting weight amongst eurozone countries is proportionally much greater than in the EU-27 (EU-28 with Croatia). This is particularly true of the larger eurozone member states.

• The safeguards proposed by the European Commission (see Section 5 below) leave the eurozone with the upper hand. Given that the 17 eurozone countries already constitute a simple majority, these countries would only need to seek the support of three ‘outs’ – whereas non-euro countries would need at least four countries.

De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.

Taken together, the EBA structure will therefore significantly shift the balance of power in favour of the eurozone, at the expense of the UK and other ‘outs’.”

If negotiation can separate EXPLICITLY the single market from economic governance then we may have a future in the EU, which is the result I would like to see. But if that cannot be achieved then we will be heading out for a nation is either:

1. a broadly sovereign state within the EU (As Britain might hope to be by retaining sovereign powers-of-the purse in a post-convergence EU)

2. a functioning part of a larger sovereign entity as the euro-core will become (As members of the post-convergence eurozone will become)

The only other alternative is being a dependent adjunct to a larger sovereign entity. A Sanjak, in short, much as Greece was and is again today.

Becoming an EU Sanjak is neither liberal nor democratic, so propose me a solution because otherwise we will be leaving…………",0,1368366269,null,0,false,0,c9x9byk,t3_1e6h3s,t1_c9x9byk,t3_1e6h3s,null,1431219278,-6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6

But if you look at another culture and think 'Well, they worship nature gods which is so stupid when everyone knows Christianity is the only religion that's advanced', but ignore that their religion helps the tribe keep balance with humanity and natural processes instead of in conflict with them. Or you think 'Wow, those Inuits are really stupid for building houses out of ice. Why don't they use brick and wood like we do? Our buildings are clearly superior to that!', but you ignore that the igloo enables them to responsibly fish and hunt by moving quickly before anything is depleted and that it's actually a really clever way to build a house out of very little. That's the kind of ethnocentrism that gets troubling. And of course those are just examples - I'm not accusing you personally of thinking those things!

Most normal people aren't book critics. Most normal critics read the books they criticise.

I'm typing on my phone, which is a great hassle. I should have put 'pretend' between simply and the. 

'Don't like, don't read' + 'End of story' - If you don't like the book you shouldn't read it or say anything bad about. No ifs or buts, end of story. 

As I already said, there are other reasons to read a book other than enjoyment.

Only the most dyed in the wool conservatives have the chutzpah to argue that front-loaded austerity is necessary to avoid high credit costs.

Others even have 'trips' that will notice if you're simply spamming a certain phrase. They use the same principle when we post adverts for jobs as well. 

It's a bit of a tight-rope to walk. Be sensible about including the phrases and have them where they count and it should be possible to include (for instance) ""Java, J2ee and Developer"" 5+ times on a CV. 

*Don't* spam a huge block of key words and hide it in a different colored font - just to get higher up the ratings. We'll notice and it looks amateurish. 

Another key tip here is to re-upload your CV fairly frequently when job hunting. Some recruiters may search for the *newest* CVs to fit their search criteria. If you've not updated yours in a month then it'll be at the bottom of the pile, even if you're still looking!

* 5 - I like Arc of Infinity a lot, Black Orchid is short but sweet and often overlooked if you ask me
* 6 - Haven't seen any sixth Doctor in ages, though I seem to remember Revelation of the Daleks was quite good. You could also watch the first couple of segments from Trial of a Time Lord
* 7 - Dragonfire is excellent and introduces Ace (not sure about others' opinions but one best companions in my eyes), Silver Nemesis is interesting

It was my first role in recruitment and their policy very much through me in the deep end (I hope you understand, I won't be throwing dirt by naming the companies I've worked for). 

Suffice it to say I was given an account manager who quit after my being there 3 months.. all my work for him went to waste and the client was lost. Next, the roles I was required to work were *very* far fetched in their needs (think ""someone who can make composite hulls for submarines, willing to work for a not-great salary in a wet and desolate corner of the UK""). 

When push came to shove, it was time to move on and since my degree is far more focused in IT than engineering anyway, that suited me just fine. I could've done things better as well I think - knowing what I now know - but that's life! 

To answer your second question... 

I can only keep things general as I don't run the business and am not privvy to the costs involved. But...

There's fairly good money in what we do - but we also do a lot of leg work that frees up the time of the companies we work on behalf of. Percentages will vary (we try to stick nearer 20%, but will work lower depending on the client and how likely we are to be able to fill the role). 

As you've said there - we don't see *any* money on jobs we do not fill. The jobs we fill - we see an agreed percentage of the final salary offered to the candidate. This money comes from the company and not from the candidates salary (so to candidates - we are free to use). That's our motivation to do a good job and find the best possible people for the companies we work for. 

As an indication of how we free up the time of the parent company; we recently recruited for a Software Tester position in the North West of England. We received over 300 CVs in a week. We didn't speak to everyone - but going through the relevant candidates and shortlisting for them was not a rapid task. 

Now imagine having not just the one role... but 10... 20 roles on. That's how busy it gets. We do prioritize based on urgency / which companies are most responsive to work with - but it's still a busy life. 

Being smart about that though - can wind up bringing in a very reasonable amount of money. My consultancy is not large (roughly 10 people) and yet we break £100k business every month. That's certainly enough to keep the company going, pay the employees (including their commission for jobs placed) and so on.

What was once snappy dialogue has turned into a companion who is utterly immune to everything happens to her (I noticed this regression in Amy too, turning her from possibly my favourite ever companion in S5 to utterly intolerable in S7).

Meanwhile, what was once an inversion of familiar tropes has turned into an annoying miasma of 'irony' hanging over the show. It's impossible to immerse yourself in Who now, because everything is self-aware and self-referential.

And the whole push toward standalone episodes has made the show weaker, not better. Journey to the centre of the TARDIS should have been a two-parter. Nightmare in silver should have been two-parters. What we are left with is trying to compress too much into 45 minutes, and that means character development can't happen. Now, we have people that we don't care about–when we find out a robot is really a brother, who really cares?

The reason that the Doctor Who movie was so terrible is that the show was tailored for what was believed to be appealing to Americans. I am getting the feeling that in season 7, they are trying to appeal to us Americans again. And, instead of complex stories that take a while to get my head wrapped around, we are left with dribble.

I'll re-watch The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon just because it is complex and mindblowing. I'll re-watch Human Nature/Family of Blood because of the characters that I actually come to care for. But S7–I can't think of any of the episodes I'll want to go back to re-watch.

The industry is sustainable but to be frank - ones career in it can go three ways. You're either successful and make good money, not successful and drop out, or you coast along with just enough to get by without being let go. 

The thing about recruitment consultancy is that it *is* a sales job. You don't need a lot of scientific, IT or engineering experience to do it. Consultancies could take their staff from a car sales job or high street retail. Only time tells whether someone will be an asset or a liability. It is somewhat cut-throat but not all companies operate this way. I've seen the 'revolving door' and managers who will work *very* hard to make sure their staff are successful - unsurprisingly I prefer the second of the two!

true,SewHappyGeek,null,null,"It is my understanding that ethnocentrism is not the same as disapproving other cultures' lack of basic human rights, one of which is to not harm people unnecessarily. So if you dismiss other aspects of their culture (ones that aren't inherently harmful, like music or dance) as inferior because they're different from your culture's, that IS ethnocentrism. And it's possible to take issue with egregious aspects of another culture without condemning the *entire* culture. 

For example, the CofE doesn't allow women to be bishops. Not only is this a very obvious example of a cultural and religious bias against women in positions of authority, it's a tremendous waste of potential. Why tell approx 50% of the population you don't want their help? Pointing this out and expressing dissatisfaction with it isn't the same thing as ethnocentrism. It would be incredibly unfair of me to dismiss the entire culture based on this policy alone. What about the food? History? The rule of law? The NHS? I have an issue with this one thing, but I cannot dismiss the entire culture - that is grossly unfair. 

So dislike aspects of culture which make harm acceptable, but try not to paint every bit of culture with the same brush based on one thing. Some things are surely of interest and value. Some things are reprehensible. This is true in every culture and nation, but refusing to see the bad in your own and constantly dismissing the good in others is what makes ethnocentrism so unpopular.

As it's a 'positive marking' system add as much flair as you possibly can to your essays. Aim for several ticks per sentence. Remember don't repeat yourself- use a synonym! Variety tells the examiner you have an extensive knowledge of vocab.
If your vocabulary is limited make sure you go over basic vocab for each topic- for me the topics are School, Environment, Home Life, Tourism, Health, etc. However the essay that comes up may put you in a scenario and won't be focused on a particular topic, be prepared if this happens.

Remember it's equally as important to cover the bullet points asked of you- you ought to aim for full marks in 'content' so ensure you don't forget to mention something you need to talk about.

My point was not to compare the level of bias shown, but to reflect that every news outlet has bias. 

RT is (partly) funded by the Kremlin, so yes they have to pay lip service to Putin. The BBC is funded by the licence payer which gives them a degree of autonomy. There is a reason why the BBC World Service is one of the most globally accessed means of means of news information in the world.

But if you think they the BBC is wholly without bias, and the the corridors of BBC HQ are paved with gold, you're living in cloud cuckoo land.

After the Boston bombings, there was a huge earthquake in the Sichuan province in China, killing hundreds. Fewer people knew about it because the same level of news coverage was not given to it on the BBC. 

There are actually good reasons for this which have to do with different types of bias you're obviously not aware of.

Firstly there is personal/institutional bias, where one person or an organization forces their opinions on the editorial team (Murdoch/sun, Kremlin/RT)

Secondarily, there is regional bias. This is largely self perpetuating, because we show more empathy with people and issues we can relate to. i.e. people who look/act like us, also democracies involved in acts of terrorism.

Regional bias also takes place on a smaller level at the BBC where issues are often more South-East/London centric.

This is bias. Remember, I'm not comparing the BBC to the fucking Pravda during the Soviet Union, just to say that we should all try and stay informed about the bias that exists in all news media outlets.

true,SewHappyGeek,null,null,"I'm not doing a very good job explaining. I apologise.

It's laudable to be pissed of with a culture denying human rights. And normal. It starts creeping into something more negative if you say this: 'Fuck their intricate art, linguistically fascinating language and multi-harmonic music. Those assholes think it's ok to circumcise young girls - everything about their culture fucking sucks. *And MINE is way better!!*' Dismissing the ENTIRE culture based on one thing and __insisting that YOURS is superior__ is ethnocentric. One aspect of their culture is extremely troubling, but thinking yours is somehow *inherently better* is what makes ethnocentrism so destructive. Somalia isn't the UK. Yes, female circumcision is awful. But just because a culture does something different from your doesn't make their whole culture shit. 

Ethnocentrism was responsible for some of the worst aspects of colonialism. 'Oh, those Native Americans don't worship Jesus and value the mighty dollar? Well, we better introduce them to the Bible and capitalism because *CLEARLY our ideas are WAY better than theirs*. Stupid fucking savages.' That's ethnocentrism. It assumes that YOUR culture is ALWAYS better than a different one. Our culture isn't 'better than' Russian culture, Italian culture, French culture. They're different. But still equally valid and worthy of consideration.

I think I'm trying to tell you that you probably aren't ethnocentric - you're a modern person with relatively advanced ideas about human rights. Or maybe you are - but ethnocentrism has a very particular meaning (mine is ALWAYS better) and I'm not convinced you really believe that.

Because we don't export 50% of our goods to the USA.

UK firms DO trade at an economic disadvantage to US firms, quite a substantial one based not just on weird regulations and legal codes, but the US government often blatantly bans foreign firms from bidding for taxpayer funded projects or defence contracts.

If Europe moves towards being a federal government, then it could easily do the same to the UK.

* I don't mind foreign cultures. What I have a problem with is people coming and refusing to integrate completely, and setting up their own societies within our society. Eg; [The Sharia law areas in East London](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9975937/Inside-Britains-Sharia-courts.html). I personally believe ""When in Rome, do as Romans do"" but I don't mind if large communities gather for celebrations once in a while. What I mind is when they try to enforce it upon others.

* I'll try and find a link, but I read a BBC article a while ago about immigration from the early 00's. It was something along the lines of 2million jobs had been created, and 1 million of those had gone to immigrants. Now, you argue that they're better at the job, but that's not necessarily true, at all. It's far more likely that they're actually under-qualified or poorly trained, but are willing to work for less, and for longer and so it increases the revenue of the company to hire them over some 21 year old graduate who thinks the world owes them £40k/year. I don't deny many immigrants are probably good at their jobs and well qualified, but there are a large proportion who are simply hired because they are cheap labour. If we withdrew from the EU and stopped the freedom of movement then we could pick the ones who would be useful, and keep the ones out who would artificially deflate the average wage.

* There are immigrants who take jobs and there are those who come here and live on benefits. People who specifically come here to take benefits and get free healthcare. It is not race specific, you're right, and we should deal with the British people who do it too, but the fact we let people come here just to do that is far worse. 

* It may seem like that, but actually, I just think it's logical. Every country I listed is closer to that of a ""typical"" immigrant (Eastern European/Middle eastern) than us. Surely it is only reasonable that they go to a country closer? I can understand why some come here - if they have family or friends, and while I may or may not agree with it (depending on the circumstances), that is more logical than just coming here when there are several perfectly prosperous and accepting countries before hand.

PPP is a perfectly fair measure if all the figures are in PPP, if I had gone PPP, Nominal, PPP that would have been an issue. In fact from the perspective of the British consumer PPP is the best measure. PPP is one of the ways of valuing British GDP. It is a perfectly adequate measure in comparing the value of the British economy in 2012 vs. 2007, in fact considering that UK consumers must purchase so many goods from overseas it is probably the best way of measuring GDP changes. 

Relative to the beginning of 2008 the British economy is more valuable.

true,atlwantsmls,num11,,"Bale and Parker are equally at fault for me for the goal we conceded.  It was Bale's man, and Parker was a traffic cone who didn't even move.

Dempsey played well and was exactly what we needed against Stoke.  A gritty, tough player with one focus: attacking the goal.  We were playing way too much tiki-taka and not direct enough, especially once Stoke was down to 10 men.

Adebayor was playing way too deep and should have been putting pressure on the back line creating space for other attackers.  Holding the ball up is one of his strengths, but he is such a force in the box and would create so many issues on a tired, stressed defensive line.

AVB did great with using a Vertonghen, Caulker, Dawson, and Walker back line.  It was our only chance in dealing with the height of Stoke.  I'm not the biggest fan of a Huddlestone, Parker pairing, but Parker's pass to Lennon which drew the keeper out and gave Dempsey the empty net is the exact direct play you need to make against a team like Stoke.  He should be credited with an assist for that play.

Hopefully this shuts up the people who think Dempsey is shit in every game.   Just like every other player, he has strengths and weaknesses.  His strengths (tough, gritty, direct, good attacking positioning) are something no one else on the team provides while his weaknesses (technical, creative, good hold up play) are what people expect him to be since he is replacing VdV.

I'm afraid so, yes.

a)  You are not the spokesperson for the whole of the disabled community.  My mother and many, if not most, of the other disabled people I know would be offended/upset if you called them a 'crip'.

b)  In the nicest possible way, mate, nobody cares whether you're disabled or not.  We can't tell, and, if you can use a computer, you must be expected to be held to the same standards as everybody else.  /r/TheRedLion is not your blog.

If you want to keep saying it, I can't really stop you, but, respectfully, please don't act like your feelings about it are representative of disabled people as a whole. I like to think we have a friendly atmosphere going on in here, so it would be nice if we could all agree not to use words that are potentially offensive/upsetting to some people.

I realise you weren't the one who posted the excerpt of your blog in the first place, and I don't have an opinion about the language you use there.  Obviously anybody who's going to be offended about it can just not read it.

This isn't something I want to discuss further, by the way.  I feel I have given my opinion, explained it, and would rather not get into a potentially argumentative discussion about it.

&gt; The chart also shows about a 6% drop in GDP a year after the 'start of the recession' (again they don't show when the recession started and I suspect they've fiddled with this).

The start of the recession is defined as the start of the first quarter of negtive growth in 2008, which is the literal definition of ""the start of the recession"". And the 6% drop can trivially be seen to be in agreement with the quarterly data you link - consecutive falls of 0.9, 1.8, 2.1 and 1.5% from the start of the recession gives a GDP value of 93.8%, or a fall of a little over 6% after one year.

Your question of what is ""Real GDP"" is a very loaded one - there are lots of definitions, and you need to be sure you're talking about the right one. The most common one used when talking about changes in GDP, and which was used in both the quarterly growth you link to and the Guardian, is change in GDP after inflation. And, yes, traditionally a recession is considered as two quarters of negative growth by that value, not falls in absolute GDP.

* People who do the David Beckham one don't repay it because they don't exceed the income threshold. So essentially it just places an even greater burden on those who actually do useful courses.


&gt;Surely we should be trying to lower the costs for universities by cutting red tape, stopping students suing them for ridiculous reasons and increasing student housing, so courses aren’t costing people £9,000 a year

* The £9k a year is still massively subsidised - the full cost per student (at least on a STEM course) is like nearer £20k due to the labs etc. - just look how much it costs in the USA. 

* I've never heard of student litigation and it certainly isn't a dominant cost

* The 9k is for fees alone so changing the student housing situation wouldn't help that.

* You have another loan of at least £3.5k for rent/food on top of that, (the exact size depends on your combined parental income, and isn't generous), as rent is often extortionate (mainly in the South) many students work part-time. But as the £9k is just for fees.


Ultimately Higher Education should either:

* Be funded entirely from general taxation (and the government should only fund students with good A levels to study worthwhile degrees) or,

* Everyone should pay their own fees with full interest and no subsidy (welcome to the 51st State).

As I believe that it's a worthwhile investment in the future of the country I support the former, but the situation we have now really makes no sense.

Why leave the kids alone in the first place when he already knew something was up?

Why would the emperor sit back all that time knowing that the whole mess would be cleaned up with no lives lost just by setting off the bomb he knew would be harmless to the humans?  Because they ran out of minutes for the show, that's why.

Why would Clara take so quickly to being a military leader?  She's a babysitter.

I agree that he was very deep indeed, but I think Stoke were creating just way too much pressure early on. They pressed with sometimes 6 men to get the ball back and Huddlestone and Parker weren't reacting well enough. Once Ade started to run all the way back though, we had a better time of controlling possession and eventually finding a rhythm and Stoke's pressure let up. Maybe this coincided with Stoke wanted to conserve energy, especially after scoring the early goal, or maybe their pressing was simply a product of the moment then and there with the crowd raucous and whatnot. But I felt Ade's dropping super deep was what got us out of that awful first quarter of an hour or so. */2 cents*

If you want to go the development route then you're going to need *something* to show you know the languages involved. If you can't have a degree then have a portfolio of work that sings. Take on unpaid work... take on an internship or freelance or whatever else you can. Anything that shows that you have the facility to code to a standard that other people can use. 

That path won't be easy and your main task will be convincing people that you have what it takes to hold down a steady job and to do it to the level they need from you. 

Alternatively if you want to work in IT but don't mind not programming - consider doing something like web development (which is much more visual and therefore it's obvious you can either do it or not) or IT support - which will involve talking to people (are you happy with that?) but you can pick it up from a fairly low level without a degree - indeed I had a housemate once who completely screwed his degree up but he did go on to get a role in IT support and through hard work I believe he's still happy with it. 

The main thing to remember - despite it maybe being difficult - is not to let yourself get bogged down by any negative moments you've had in the past but to focus on what you *can* do and on the future. If you come across to any employer as a risk... as someone who might drop out or fail them for whatever reason... they'll be worried. I appreciate how tough that is but I am sure you can see their point of view also.

They did go to court.  However, the banks eventually won in a Supreme Court ruling, and the Office of Fair Trading was not allowed to investigate the charges.  [BBC News article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8376906.stm)

**HOWEVER**

You may be able to claim at least some of the charges back as unfair because a) assuming you have lost income because of your illness, you are in financial hardship, b) you have become trapped in a cycle of bank charge payments leaving you unable to pay bills, and c) some of the charges may be disproportionate.

You need to apply to your bank in writing explaining why you think the charges are unfair.  If they reject your claim, you may have a case to appeal to the ombudsman.

Rather than retype a guide to the whole process, I hope you don't mind if I link you to [this page](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/bank-charges), which gives a full guide to eligibility, how to apply for a refund, and how to appeal to the ombudsman, complete with template letters if you're not sure how to write one.

Be warned, there is no guarantee you will get your money back, and even if you do, it might take a long time.

If you are still completely lost even after reading the guide I've linked to, it might be worth contacting your local Citizen's Advice Bureau, find out where it is [on their website](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/).",0,1368375019,null,0,false,0,c9xbfk8,t3_1e6pgi,t1_c9xbfk8,t3_1e6pgi,null,1431218289,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

But the other thing... about that representative democracy you speak of...

I would be more ""for"" leaving the EU if we had a decent representative democracy here in the first place. Disregarding the EU, a lot of countries in Europe (at least northern ones!) have better national politics than we do here in the UK.

Given the parties and people we've had in power here for the last few decades, I can't honestly see EU governance being worse at all. We're barely progressing, if at all - our politics is just a load of back and forth while getting nowhere. I'd rather Germany be making our laws as far as everything is going right now, anyway. They get a lot wrong - but we get a hell of a lot more wrong.

The principles of leaving the EU would be more sound if we weren't just left with something equally shit and elite-powered anyway when doing so.

Actually, empirically, worker's self-management (what's called autogestion) is both more efficient and more productive than a standard capitalist model - there are good studies on this carried out by capitalist corporations like Ford, although they are horribly embarrassed by them and have tried to bury them.  The only things against it are that it isn't more profitable (which is what capitalists really care about) and it places capitalists in danger of losing control.

Why?  What is intrinsically good about working?  Especially to make money for someone else and super especially when we're talking about socially unnecessary labour which requires heavy marketing or branding or artificial scarcity to carry through profitably. There are many places I could direct you for a more detailed consideration of this, but there are two fabulous resources which spring to mind -  Bob Black's [The Abolition of Work](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-the-abolition-of-work.pdf) and Bertrand Russell's [In Praise of Idleness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ZHf1h_YAw).

Edit: Gah submitted to soon.

&gt;Socialism would restrict businesses by slashing profits that could be put back into the business for it to grow. 

""Growth or death"" is one of the principle problems with capitalism and why it is coming to an end.  You realise the Earth is not infinite?  Nor do we have infinite energy nor infinite land nor infinite resources.

Anyway. Yes, I agree that there are a lot of small companies out there like that at the moment. In the very early stages, there are e few major concerns. The first and biggest is recouping your venture money. Setup costs for what I want to do are around £500-£700 before I can sell a single product. It's a not insignificant sum particularly in situations like mine. I still have no idea if I'll get the business grant money that I want from the Jobcentre. Another factor is being taken seriously. I have major issues with the fashion industry and the clutching at trends that it necessitates, and there are a lot of people being seriously ripped off. £60 for a t-shirt with a meaningless splotch on it is absolutely not what I'm interested in. I strongly believe in the creative process and keeping artistic integrity. But if you charge too little, not only will recouping costs be difficult without selling huge volumes, people will assume that they are getting something Primark-quality. I'm no capitalist, I honestly feel uncomfortable with the idea of running a business and I certainly don't want to squeeze every penny I can out of people. Depending on how well this goes, I'll be using what control I have to keep prices affordable, quality and ethical standards high, and try to help local designers get their work known.

The nuclear deterrent argument is no longer relevant because we are no longer a divided world, between communism and capitalism. We have states that are potentially dangerous with nuclear weapons but they don't have many and aren't going to use them. If we had a way to stop their nukes even hitting us we wouldn't need ours and we (the world that didn't launch nukes) could retaliate using conventional warfare. Also, consider this, ""an eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" Trident is something we don't need nor do we need to have it.

As for the example of Libya, it would have been a mistake to go to full blown war there, we intervened in Iraq and ""liberated"" the civilians but now the violence is as bad as it ever has been 10 years on.

Alonso - Rafa was in a sell-before-buy situation, and the squad needed more English players. Alonso had come off an injury-disrupted and sub-par season, so Rafa was going to sell him to buy Barry. It didn't pan out, Alonso went on to have an excellent season, but had already decided he was going to leave if Rafa had considered selling him.

Mascherano - Unhappy that Rafa was sacked, unhappy with the lack of investment in the squad. Saw the tide turning, and bailed.

Torres - Same as Mascherano, plus unhappy at being mistaken for Carlton Cole for half a season under The Hodge. If only he hadn't made his stupid comments upon signing for Chelsea...

true,Galerath,null,null,"As somebody who has worked in IT, and used recruitment agencies, I would like to ask what might sound like a cheeky question - **do you actually have any idea what the roles you advertise for entail?**

The reason I ask is that, in my experience, recruitment agencies tend to just scan CVs for the keywords on the job descriptions. I.e. if the Job description says they're looking for a C# Developer with 2 years industry experience, the recruitment agency won't even interview a Java developer with 5 years experience, despite the fact that Java and C# are similar enough for the experience to be translatable.

The net result is that developers get railroaded by their degrees and their previous jobs - I did a Comp Sci degree where we were taught Java, and this means it's almost impossible for me to get any sort of C based job, even if it's an entry level position, because the recruiters don't seem to get the idea that most high level languages are very similar and I could pick up a new one relatively easily. It's not like hiring a Mandarin Translator to do Russian Translation, it's more like hiring a Jaguar Technician to work at a Ford Garage - the skills transfer!

We don't have to kick people out of the houses they are living in, we could take empty houses instead. The state gives you property rights, and the state can take them away again.

To be honest though, I don't think we need to kick people out of social housing and I don't think we need to seize people's homes.

Then two months ago Laura also moved out and into a flat with her long-term partner. It happened quickly and Stephanie struggled at first.

You're entirely right, it sounds to me like this woman has had mental issues for a while. The family moving out would've left her completely in the lurch with a drastically reduced income; neither of which she could cope with. 

As well as this, judging by the spelling and grammar in the letter to her daughter she probably wasn't mentally capable of dealing with the financial rammifications of the tax in a rational manner or actually understand what was going on. 

Also, its a lot easier to tell your children that the suicide was because of the Bedroom tax; something they knew was causing anxiety, than to straight up say that the reason is because they moved out.

You might think someone is being penalised a ""mere"" £20 a week if they are blocking a three bedroom house but if there is a family in temporary accommodation that's awaiting a three bedroom house, you can be damn sure that temporary accommodation is costing the local authority a hell of a lot more than £20 a week.

As I've said elsewhere, you cannot just look at those facing the under occupancy charge as victims without ALSO considering those that the charge has been brought in to help.

The whole point of the charge is to encourage those people who are over occupying properties to move out so that those who actually *need* those properties can have them.

The two issues are deeply linked. I agree it's morally wrong to penalise people when there physically is nowhere for them to go - and the policy should be changed to prevent that - but it's also morally wrong to keep a family of three or four in a B&amp;B with a bathroom shared with everyone else in the establishment.

It's not just the recruitment consultant that is making this judgement call. With our agency at least - and I'd hope with any consultant worth knowing - they'd have a chat with the employer and discuss the role in some detail (and not just take an email specification). 

Employers *also* will say they want a straight Java or C# or (whatever) developer and not someone prepared to cross-train. *They* may not be interested.

I found JTT tends to have more surreal and / or political comedy whereas Glee was more standard observational / sexual. Glee feels much stricter about audience behaviour as well, they play a message at the start of every show telling everyone to turn their phone's off and not to heckle during the show which seems stupid, if the comedians can't handle a stupid comment or an erroneous phone call then they don't deserve to be on the stage.

I'd add that we had our work Christmas party at Glee last year and it was probably the worst one we've done. They sat us all in rows with a tiny table between two people, then made everyone wait an hour and half after the food had been finished, before they started the comedy which was really poor and lasted about an hour in total.

And indeed the lack of a thriving high tech sector of the economy to employ more STEM graduates.

FWIW, I'd actually tie research in much more closely with industrial policy. British science pursues everything at the same time, but if the country has no industrial presence in that area, there will be no offshoots, and no private jobs, even if there's an amazing discovery. One of the first Lithium Ion batteries was created in Cambridge, but we had no industrial expertise in batteries. Now, almost all Lithium Ion manufacturing, and all the jobs, are in Japan. It would be better if we focussed more on areas where we have a chance of getting our foot in the door. And indeed had a big pot of money to invest in industrial applications for emerging.technologies.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There's various elements - exam technique, picking the right subjects, learning the material, and of course natural intelligence. 

If you're a good A * student now, just keep it up. Work hard, do the homework, read around the subjects you're studying. 

When it comes to doing your exams, for the vast majority of subjects, it's at least 50% exam technique. History, maths, english. It's just about learning what the examiners give marks for and what they don't. You can also learn how to make the examiner pleased to be marking your paper (clear presentation, accurate grammar and punctuation, don't try and use superfluous language you don't need). They're more likely to give ""benefit of the doubt"" marks to a paper that is presentable and easy to read (which makes them happy) than one that is scrawled all over the place and hard to distinguish one word from the next.

If you pick the right subjects, you're more likely to get good grades. Think about not just what you enjoy (which is a key part), but also what teachers you could get, and what the course involves. Some choices were obvious for me (French - I believe you should always do a language at GCSE [and to be honest A level, which I regret not doing and couldn't honestly tell you why I didn't do it for A level], and I'm pretty much fluent). Some I had to choose between - I really wanted to do computing, and I was decent at it in year 9, but I knew I was better at history, and the history department in general was a lot stronger. 

Learning material is in all honestly, very easy. I spent about 2 hours revising the content of each subject in study leave, maximum. The content is usually pretty basic and if you've listened and done the work over the course it should come back pretty quickly. I wouldn't recommend being a cocky little shit like I was and not revising as much as I should've though, make sure you know it. The rest of my revision was just past papers, looking at questions and learning how to apply my knowledge to each individual question.

Natural intelligence is obviously not something you can change, but if you're a top student, you probably are reasonably intelligent already, so you're good on that one. A good memory helps too.

Essentially an employer can only hire a non-EU national if there are no suitably qualified UK or EU nationals that can do the job.

It's an expensive process to do this and it's certainly possible, but as a recent graduate with (I assume) very little work experience, what would you be able to offer an employer that a recent UK/EU graduate cannot?

I'm sure someone will be along shortly with the specific visa requirements, but it's going to be difficult for you.

You certainly *could* come as a visitor and see if you can find a company willing to sponsor you but be prepared to write it off as a long and expensive holiday rather than the start of your new career.

If 20 Hollywood stars organised a meeting with no press allowed inside and the theme of the discussion was kept secret to the world, the world press would be falling over themselves to gain access speculating for days on just what is going in there. When the worlds elite from politicians, bankers, financiers, defence, military, intelligence and even royalty meet in secret, there was literally no press for well over 40 years.

I think that its concerning that these people meet in secret because they aren't talking about Delia Smiths new recipe, they are discussing policy that may have effect globally. In particular, US senators that visit are already in violation of the Logan Act which is supposed to stop people meeting in secret while they're in office so corrupt dealing done happen.

As a very clear example of what happens inside these think tank and policy centres, take a look at this Guardian article.

The christmas episode was just detestable as it felt too.. forced, too much pushy to attract kids and be a storytale. Journey Into The Center of the TARDIS was.. mediocre, and copped out with a Deus Ex Machina, thats not a good story, thats terrible script writing. 

A lot of the problems are that the series has tried to summarise everything up in one episode, and thats brilliant, but when you have utter quality scripts that are too much to be forced into one episode, there's the problem. The pace is TOO romping. Too quick, no time for the audience to relax and take in whats happening. I tuned in 5 minutes late last night and the Cybermen were already attacking, what did I miss?! 2-parters are needed, as they give room for minor plotlines to develop and allow more laughs and character development, whilst having that extra 50 minutes to create stretching and elbow room for the audience to pause and absorb whats going on.

true,Fineus,null,null,"To be honest, I much prefer emails for keeping in touch over general matters. I'm sure this varies from person to person. 

The trouble with phones - both calling and receiving - is you have no idea what the other person is doing when you call them. I tend to find myself quite 'in the zone' when working through a search or whatever I might be up to - so if someone calls for a general chat about the state of the job market, I'd find it quite off-putting. 

If it were put in an email however, I could get back to that person at an appropriate time without being distracted. 

Generally I'd advise against ringing again and again without a good reason. It would be irritating. As an anecdote we had one candidate who really would call daily for one of our consultants... and who was quite unable to accept that that person was busy with other business or had to go. It almost became a running joke within the office because no matter how we tried to deal with it without being rude - this person would call again and again to talk about anything from their other interviews with other companies to the job market to how they were feeling about their current job. 

We *do* try and provide a consultative service (I mean, here I am) but ultimately we're not able to chat for hours without getting to a point. 

With that in mind - email is best for general questions etc. Anything specific about a job can certainly warrant a phone call but if you find yourself with many questions over and over, consider an email as well. 

I hope that makes sense, it's hard to find that line between articulating that we're busy - without implying that we're too busy to talk to the candidates we work with! ",0,1368385532,null,0,false,0,c9xejxu,t3_1e6fey,t1_c9xejxu,t1_c9xect3,null,1431216817,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

As you point out, this latter stage is what we're not very good at. There have been countless examples of British research that ended up being commercialised elsewhere. This is the stage we should be funding. 

Unfortunately the UK has allowed its industrial base to decline, and the UK doesn't like the skilled immigrants we'd need to help build it up again. So we're a bit stuffed there.

Tell me three years ago we weren't motivated to win the FA cup, tell me last year we weren't motivated to win the league. I think the problem that arose this year was from nerves. We were told only a league win was a success, then when that was impossible second and a trophy. I also think Mancini damaged morale when he basically said the difference was RVP. Whilst that may be true you can't say it! It undermined all of our players. City has had some fantastic coaches in the last 20 years; From Joe Royle and Willie Donachie to Mancini, Kidd &amp; Platt. The problem is now we don't just need someone who is good at coaching and working with what we've got.

What you're arguing for is the morality of the miser: even if there's no other need for the property, and even if the cost saving isn't significant - indeed, the process of rehousing vulnerable social tenants is likely to generate significant costs in itself - people should be brought down a peg, just because. I think that's a terrible outlook.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Trust me. I've taken a year long unit in EU law and they can't. 

[The case of Bidar v UK is decisive](http://www.eucaselaw.info/dany-bidar-2005/):

&gt;It concerns an individual of French nationality, Dany Bidar, who completed his secondary education in the UK. After that, he enrolled at University College London and applied for a maintenance loan. Even if he was granted financial aid with tuition fees, he was refused the maintenance loan on the basis that he was not “settled” in the UK. In order to be “settled” a person has to have lived in the UK for four years other than for the purposes of receiving full-time education...

&gt;The ECJ was asked whether a student applying for student loan in the UK could invoke the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality laid down in Article 12 EC Treaty.
ECJ stated that a student, during the residence in a host Member State, can rely on the right of equal treatment contained in article 12 EC Treaty ([Now Article 18 TFEU](http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_18))...If a student’s financial position changes with the passage of time, this cannot automatically have adverse effects upon his right of residence. Therefore it was unlawful to deny French citizen Dany Bidar access to student loans for maintenance purposes during his studies at University College London. However **it is legitimate for a Member State to grant such assistance only to students who have demonstrated a certain degree of integration into the society of that State**. The existence of a certain degree of integration may be regarded as established by a finding that the student in question has resided in the host Member State for a certain length of time.

In short, EU students must be charged the same fees as the citizens of the host member state [(Gravier v City of Liege [1985])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravier_v_City_of_Liege) but loans to assist with those fees and for maintenance are outside of the treaty and there is no obligation to treat them the same as UK citizens. Whether the UK government wants to treat them as UK citizens or not is up to the government. This case concerned maintenance loans only but as far as I know tuition fee loans are included as well. There's nothing in the wording to say other wise and even so maintenance loans were greater at the time of this case than tuition loans and so would have made up the bulk of the government's assets with foreign student. 

Even if tuition loans weren't included the EU says students need sufficient resources to not be a burden before they come here so most will not need a loan anyway. 

The European Commission says in Council Directive 93/96/EEC Article 1 that:

&gt;In order to lay down conditions to facilitate the exercise of the right of residence...the Member States shall recognize the right of residence for any student who is a national of a Member State...where the student assures the relevant national authority, by means of a declaration...**that he has sufficient resources to avoid becoming a burden on the social assistance system** of the host Member State during their period of residence, provided **that the student is enrolled in a recognized educational establishment** for the principal purpose of following a vocational training course there **and that he is covered by sickness insurance** in respect of all risks in the host Member State.

As a side note these are the same at the EU regulations on freedom of movement generally. It's found in Article 7 of Council Directive 2004/38/EC:

&gt;All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State for
a period of longer than three months if they:

&gt;(a) are workers or self-employed persons in the host Member State; or

&gt;(b) **have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members** not to become a burden on
the social assistance system of the host Member State during their period ofresidence **and
have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member State**

true,[deleted],null,null,"Agree. I think it's because a lot of the critics who write these kind of reviews are also aspiring novelists, and are a little jealous. It's also probably because they have a genuine appreciation for the sort of art culture that Dan Brown pretends he's referencing, and they don't like that he's bringing it down to a popular audience in such a blackface kind of way. For instance, anyone with even the remotest appreciation for art would never ever call a novel ""The Da Vinci code"" because that literally doesn't make sense. Likewise his analysis of The Last Supper is beyond farcical, and yet generations of readers are convinced that they're true because of the prelude to the start of the book where he claims nothing can be disproven. 

I actually enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and don't mind Dan Brown, but I can understand why people, and especially critics, despise him. For years there have been many quite genuine people out there trying to desperately bring the appreciation of old works of art to the masses, and then Dan Brown swoops down with the sort of crazy theory you would see on an insane conspiracy forum board and suddenly whole hosts of people visit The Last Supper just to see a Mary Magdalene who isn't there. I imagine if I'd spent my entire life studying art history and then have the population at large associate my field of expertise with the kind of nonsensical shit in Dan Brown I'd be a little annoyed too.

I watched about half of the first season Moffat did and gave up on the vampires of Venice episode. After that I tuned in a little for the next season which threatened to get interesting (the idea of the silence aliens was fucking awesome), but then it went out with a poof. Watched the first episode of the next season, didn't bother going back.

I have no intention of watching the new series.

Ultimately, it just comes down to one thing- Moffat isn't a good writer. He's capable of brilliant stuff, but I get the impression he needs to do it on his own time. When he's forced we get contrived plots, deus ex machina, lack of attention to detail, ill advised concepts, annoying characters and... it's hard to describe it but he's just not capable of creating emotional investment in the way Davies was.

true,Icanhazcomment,null,null,"Honestly speaking we paid the price for Torres's name rather than his ability because he was already on a downward slope at that time. He played a great last game against Chelsea but apart from that he was already under performing at Liverpool. Not to the extent as he did at Chelsea in the last season but you could see where it was going.

This season he has picked it up. Though we are trying to make the club recognized. Clubs like Liverpool, Madrid, United and pretty much every club which is said to be a ""big club"" right now has had these biggest names in football come and go through the club. It is more of a marketing and stone walling move rather than that players ability at times as often in their history Madrid acquired top players slightly on the downside of their career for exactly this reason so that whenever the name of that player is brought up it is directly linked to Madrid regardless of how good or how bad that player was for them.

To establish yourself as a big club and to capture large fan bases you have to have these big names like the Torres and the Shevas pass through your club and for that you have to pay the highest fee even if they are out of form or underperforming. It turned out great for us in a way, he was the key for us to getting Mata and then the Mata turnaround allowed us to get the rest of the Spanish lads as well, this is a huge reason why he was brought to Chelsea.

If you win the titles without having these recognizable players come and go through your club as soon as you fall down from your top spot everyone is going to forget you, you will not be the big club you would want to be, something Chelsea is still trying to achieve. But if you look at Liverpool they can be fighting for relegation yet every team will still go to Anfield still thinking they are facing a top 4 team.

But hey, a year ago everyone in Belgium said Benteke was not ready for the premier league. One year later and he scored 19 goals for a mid table club in his first year in the EPL. so who knows what will happen with Thorgan Hazard?

There is another hazard , the youngest one, Kylian, and he is incredibly talented. Many believe he is even better than Eden. I am not sure if he is on contract with Chelsea though.

Oh, and Chelsea has another hidden Belgian talent in their youth team. Charly Musonda junior. Amazing world class player, before he came to Chelsea everybody wanted him (Barcelona, Manchester City, Real, ..). He is not old enough yet for the first team, but give him a few years , maybe a loan and he will be amazing!

I prefer Our Millionaire Merchant Venturing Man of the People Mayor to be judged by standards of conduct I would expect from ANY public or civil servant. 

If a teacher, or DWP staff, or fireman told a member of the public ""now fuck off"" because they were irritated by them, and then denied saying it in a public meeting, then a video proved the contrary - I would expect that public servant to face disciplinary proceedings.

If they then tried to deflect the story by accusing the member of the public of harrassment, and refuse to apologise for losing their temper, I would be looking for them to resign.

Some of it stays up, and there is some deeper archive material, but small amounts in the grand scheme of things.

This happens because there's always adverts on the 4OD shows, and thus always new revenue to pay the rights costs for leaving stuff up. The BBC can't do that - every extra day stuff stays on iPlayer is more cost, and comes out of the same flat licence fee, and therefore means less programmes get made with the money instead.

And the BBC does make things available later commercially - it did via SeeSaw with ads, via MSN video with ads (both of which went out of business as not many people actually want to watch old programming), and now via Lovefilm and Netflix.",0,1368390867,null,0,false,0,c9xg5yk,t3_1e6jgz,t1_c9xg5yk,t1_c9xfnnt,null,1431216058,8,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,8

true,Icanhazcomment,null,null,"The problem isn't with Chelsea fans, Roman and even Sturridge, the problem is the way we are set up. It is extremely difficult for a striker to play in the current Chelsea line up. We are in a way playing a false 9 line up and replacing the number 9 with a striker which doesn't bode with the false 9 line up. I would say that if we replaced one of our strikers and played a midfielder instead using a false 9 system it would work out even better for us overall providing less gaps in the midfield and less goals conceded on counters which was one of our biggest weakness this season.

Our midfield scored 83 goals this season, defenders 28 and the strikers only 27 (21 from Torres). Our line up plays in such a way that even Torres becomes a wing player mid game and the midfield comes in barging in goals left right and center. However we do not play in that style of playing the odd man up and directly the attack through that one channel which was what Sturridge needed. Nor do we play in that style of what Torres thrived on at Liverpool which now Sturridge does.

Now Torres works with our new style amazingly. He is a striker who these days actually likes to go out on the wings and let others score if he isn't getting a chance. Sturridge was the opposite, he was the wide player who wanted to do the opposite and come inside to score, score and just score. He wanted to be the lone striker so badly that at times he stopped passing to anyone else which started all the selfish nonsense the people who only watch a couple of matches talk about. This not only caused his own performances to suffer but the rest of the team had to try to play in a style that they were not designed to.

He thrived at Bolton and we knew he would thrive at most clubs  and even Chelsea at that time but our style completely changed when Drogba finally left. Even though we were not happy to see him go we were happy that he would fit much better in another club getting the chance he deserved and thats why we support his move to Liverpool. A lot of Chelsea fans love Sturridge because he went to Bolton and got a great spot but everytime you put a mic to his mouth he used to talk about playing for Chelsea as that was his aim. This is what the Chelsea fans wanted too but it became obvious that the new Chelsea playing style would not work for him and in hindsight this worked out well for everyone. He would be sitting on the Chelsea bench not because he lacked quality but because the team wouldn't do what would click him and a player of this quality deserves to start in the league not rot on the bench.

Had he been playing as the striker in the style when we used to channel every attack through Drogba he would have run riot on the league playing for Chelsea but that is the kind of style Chelsea gave up after Drogba left and it has resulted in setting a new goal scoring record.

This is the reason Chelsea fans still wish him well and know that even though he plays so good, we cant have him until we change back to our old style.

You name Scholes and Giggs, then say offer Lampard a new deal with the same wage. A 34 year old, on a £150k a week is ridiculous. Giggs aren't anywhere near that amount, and with FFP coming in, it's an easy decision financially speaking. 

Drogba left because he felt it was time, in the Sky Sports documentary he said he would have stayed if we didn't win the Champions League, but with how we won it, he felt it was a fitting end to his career at Chelsea.

City have too good of a squad to stay out of the Champions League. In fact they should have won the league this season if they were consistent because they had no trouble against Chelsea or United. 

United on the other hand have a new manager but SAF is not going anywhere as much as we fans are thinking. He is still on the United board and I am pretty sure that he will be the one dictating most of the moves of United. Moyes will be in a way channeling Fergie's decisions until Fergie completely leaves United. I really doubt this will be a transition season for them and they might even win the league again.

Tottenham and Arsenal though do not deserve to be in the Champions League. Even if I put my hatred that I've grown up with for them aside, they do not have what it takes to compete in cup competitions let alone the biggest one of them all. I would bet right now that if you put Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham past the group stages of the Champions League with their current squads, Liverpool would still go further than them. Arsenal especially do not have a squad to raise a trophy, it does not have that mentality to begin with. Even if you don't have Messi or Ronaldo you mentality and will can still get you there which is what they lack. I know Chelsea players are called mercenaries but when things go to shit they put their heads together and they got the results and that is what a club who want the win does. 

Tottenham and Arsenal have this problem of losing to the better team. When they face a better team they will lose +80% of the time and that will never get you a cup if you keep following that mentality. To win a cup you need a team which even if it is not the best, can beat the best if it needs to. Look at what Wigan did to City just yesterday. I honestly believe the fourth spot for the Champions League should not go to either one of these. They are a betting mans wet dream and will lose at the most predictable time.

This is why every season they play for the Champions League spot and when they get there they don't know what to do with it. As soon as a better side comes they lose. Grow a sack and beat the better team, English squads will rarely be as good as other teams are now in Europe so if you are only playing for the Champions League Revenue, you are going to get knocked out on will.",0,1368392542,null,0,1368392774,0,c9xgoth,t3_1e759j,t1_c9xgoth,t1_c9xgbp2,null,1431215740,25,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,25

true,Froolow,null,null,"It's a lot more complex than you suggest - if both sides have ten pieces left that can each move to ten spaces then the first move could be to 1 of 100 spaces. The return could be any one of 100 remaining spaces, so 100^100. Then there are 100 possible counters, 100 possible counter-counters and so on, for a grand total of 100^100^100^100^100^100 moves. Which is a lot!

In fact, it's so many that even the best chess computers working flat out have only 'solved' chess when there are six pieces or fewer on the board (not per side, but in total). Even that takes a massive supercomputer a heck of a lot of time, so chess computers have to solve the game by ignoring obviously stupid moves (for example, if your queen is in danger the computer will ignore all moves that result in you losing your queen on the return).

Although the terminology was very confusing; 'checkmate in three' implies that there is *nothing* cyber-doctor could do to avoid checkmate in three moves (otherwise the opening position is 'checkmate in two', provided black plays like an idiot), so I don't know why he was panicking so much - either he had already lost at that point or good-doctor was lying.

Yes, I didn't change your words to fit my argument, I quoted your words practically verbatim.

We just happen to disagree about who is living off whom.

&gt; If you're born into any family, then you're entitled to your parents belongings when they die. 

That's your opinion.

I mean, it's an opinion supported by our current laws, but ""moral entitlement"" is a matter of opinion.

&gt; If you're saying that hereditary wealth is so terrible that it should be done away with completely, … what will you do with that money? Give it to the state? Seems rather unfair to me.

""The state"" seems to be the way we describe government when we don't like what it's doing.

The government is an institution that should operate at the will of the people.

So what ""giving money to the state"" means is something like ""deciding amongst ourselves how this money can most fairly benefit our society"".

I'm not going to argue with you, because I don't think we're going to progress the discussion very far.

I now tend to keep my statements on hereditary wealth fairly short and sweet, because all I hope to do is make people question whether or not we have to follow this status quo we've fallen into.

The way you talk of ""rights"", it seems to me like you're just talking about convention - about what's normal and common and what you expect to happen. 

I don't think the ""rights"" people grant to each other when trying to live and work together in a harmonious society need, any longer, to conform to feudal expectations.

Arguments for hereditary wealth seem to me like arguments for a de facto aristocracy.

It isn't going to be a selling point for BT to compete for sports viewers, it's going to be a selling point for BT to promote their broadband.

If you're already a Sky customer without BT broadband this isn't likely to look very enticing over Sky's sports package which, while it is a bit more expensive, gives you a lot more content.  On top of that, if you aren't interested enough in sport to already have Sky Sports, then you aren't going to be interested enough to pay BT £12-£15 per month for their sports offering.

Ultimately, I don't see much overlap between Sky Sports customers and BT Sport customers.  This is going to be most attractive to those people who already have, or are thinking about getting, BT broadband.  I don't see people cancelling Sky Sports en masse to add BT Sports.

With Hazard we have a player that, whenever he gets the ball, supporters of the opposing teams get scared, because the guy is capable of anything, he has that dangerous unpredictability about him. He can create a goal out of nothing. Under the right management, one can make a good player like Hazard be great.

And I'm not condoning the use of either but here are some facts: Bomb making materials in the UK are tracked electronically if certain ingredients are bought together, or separately on the same cards, accounts or addresses. There are ways to get around this such as only using cash but then the store is contacted for their CCTV tapes by MI5 or the police and plots even from the last month have been thwarted. We're very good at not having our citizens killed. In the US on the other hand, every man and his mum owns a gun, and even if they don't they can get hold of one generally with impunity and go pump round after round in to children and teachers.

As has been demonstrated in very recent history, a bomb in the US caused I think 9-12 deaths/injuries. Where guns on rampages total in the 100s. Statistically firearms are more destructive on civil soil. 

The labeling difference is important because ""terrorist"" and the ""war on terror"" hold connotations that it is something that can be beaten, when quite frankly someone will always be out to hurt people, but ""terrorists"" also get air time to spread their message, to *scare* people, which is the whole point and also leads to a lot of copy cats.

Treating them just as criminals is important, because it does not hold connotations of an ideology someone can get behind. It is a standard that very few people wish to achieve and most of all, they don't get much air time. It's addressed on the news the news like any thing else and then the football results come on and most people forget.

true,TedsBabies,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"When you say 'your words' you imply that what I said was related to what you are talking about, which it was not.

Mrs Bottrill was living off the people in the very purest sense. She didn't work, and had her food, utilities and accommodation paid for her by others. The rich man in my example works, and earns money to spend on what they like, and their offspring live off them alone, not the rest of society.

If it's an opinion supported by law, then it stops being just at opinion and starts being how it actually currently is. When your parents die, you get what is left to you. They could give it all to charity if they'd like, or you could get it all, it's up to them. But it is their money, and it up to them to do with it how they see fit.

The state is the government, and the government is the state. It should operate as the will of the people, but that doesn't give them the right to take money from private citizens without due reason. Taxation is a due reason; as that money is used to help the person it is taken from as well as others, taking all of someone money when they die is not, as the person sees no good from it. 

Also, it isn't giving the money to the state, it is the state taking that money from private citizens. To me that's just theft. Those people earned that money, and just because they're dead doesn't mean that the government has a bigger claim to it than their family does.

In this case, the only rights involved are that the government doesn't have any entitlement to take what is your just because you're dead. If that's normal and common that I'm glad, because that's how it should be. It isn't conforming to feudal expectations, it's conforming to what fair for each person.

Your utopia, where you could deny people the right to live in houses their parents bought is utterly ludicrous, simply because it implies that all money is public money, when in fact, almost all of it is private.",0,1368396551,null,0,false,0,c9xhxt3,t3_1e6be8,t1_c9xhxt3,t1_c9xhjl2,null,1431215151,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The hospital also offers a range of complementary therapies to patients, many of whom get a real benefit from attending.  Things like aromatherapy, acupuncture, some CBT, and meditation, which do have an evidence base.  Patients from the adjacent Beatson Oncology Centre come for respite between chemotherapy regimes.  There is a Zen garden and fish pond.  Don't underestimate how useful the above can be for some patients.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"A change in manager could be disastrous. Even when a manager leaves a club in relatively good condition, it can be problematic. There are some Barce fans calling for Villanova's head already after their Champions league debacle, and while that's obviously a bit rash, it's not too different from sacking Mancini after the season we've had. Obviously Barcelona's standards for success are different from ours, but the point remains. Look at what happened when Chelsea sacked Ancelotti, or when Mourinho left Inter. There's even reason for United to be concerned next year with Moyes taking over. 

Bringing in a new manager often requires a long transitionary period for that manager to be able to make the team his own (and when they don't get that time you end up with situations like Chelsea since the departure of Ancelotti). It means changing up the squad, and adopting new tactics, it means a new dynamic with the club hierarchy, if the manager is new to the league, it can take a long time to adapt, as it did initially with Mancini, it can mean money wasted on poor transfers. It's a significant change and there's a lot that can go wrong. It's not something you want to risk if you can avoid it. 

This years failings come down to poor attitude of the squad, which the manager can have a big effect on that, but ultimately can't dictate completely. Having a season like this should give the players a much bigger kick in the pants than a new manager likely would. The other problems we've had this year can also be adressed without a managerial change. The lack of formational flexibility and width is already being adressed in the form of the 4-3-3 set up that we're planning on switching to next year. Our failure to keep up with United's improvements can be adressed by spending some of the US TV deal cash we're about to get, and selling players who are surplus to our needs—whether because of their quality, or contract details—and replacing them with new ones.

There are definitely things that need to change for next year, but none of them require a new manager, and unless changing manager is absolutely necessary, it shouldn't happen.

true,StormySan,eng-westmidlands,Brummagem,"Homeopathy practice is the belief that you can treat an illness by giving very, very small quantities of the thing causing the illness. For example, to treat a stomach ache, you'd use something that *causes* a stomach ache. The diluting process is very specific - it has to be shaken in a particular way each time it's diluted.

Homeopathy holds that the more a concentration is diluted, the more powerful it will be. This results in most mixtures being diluted so much that there is a statistical near-certainty of there not being a single molecule left of the original substance. That's ok though, because homeopathy practitioners claim that water has a memory of what has been in it.

To the rest of the modern world, these people are what we call ""charlatans"". They're so good at selling water claiming it heals you, however, that they convinced the government to give them money to let them practise under the NHS. Because they're on the NHS, people who otherwise know nothing about them believe there's some substance to what they say, as, well, the government wouldn't give them money on the NHS if it didn't work, would they?

true,anxiousbadger,welsh,Wales,"Basically sympathetic magic.

Invented by a German 200-odd years ago who invented a system of medicine based around the idea of 'like cures like'.  So, if if you had a problem with, say, hyperactivity, you could cure it with caffeine (as it produces the same symptoms as the problem you're trying to cure).
Here's the mad bit - he thought that the more dilute a remedy is, the more powerful the healing effect.  So to produce a remedy you take a solution of the substance you are using, take a drop of it and dilute it in water.  Then you bang the vial against a leather book a certain number of times (called 'succusion' or 'potentisation' which lets the water 'remember' the substance) and repeat the process as many times as you want.
Nowadays it's mostly all automated and the final remedy is dropped onto a lactose pill and allowed to evaporate - the pill 'remembers' the homeopathic power.

Don't leave stuff on display in your car if you don't want it stolen.

Anyway, I used this map. (Filter for parking only (red tags) in the top right bubble.)

I looked for a 24 hour parking that was free and  the only one that met your criteria was Belper Road.

All the other 24 hour parking places have to be paid for. But some are as cheap as £6.

edit: By the way there are 2 Belper roads right next to eachother. The one with the parking is the Belper Road that joins Radford Road.

Yes. You're missing the fact that Moffat is physically incapable of seeing a dead horse without having to beat it until it's glue. That, and you're missing the fact that ""consequences"" don't exist in his vision of Doctor Who.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You seem to think that a television show needs to portray the most accurate depiction of children. considering the nature of the show, i don't think it's that big of a stretch to NOT depict a teenager as a little asshole. 

no where in the last two episodes has the subject of the loss of Angie's mother been brought up. considering the attention span of the children the show targets, i doubt many of them even remember that Angie lost her mother, therefore her bad attitude is completely unwarranted, in the most immediate context. 

the only instances which would cause Angie to become hostile during the show would be when people kept mistaking Clara as a relative, a mother or a sister, BUT the writers didn't bother expanding on those little occurances to put Angie's anger at the confusion into proper context for her outlash. All we see is Angie make a correction by saying, 'she's not my [blank]' and nothing more from that. so when she lashes out, there's no call back as to WHY she's lashing out, hence the reason why the character is really lame and seriously doesn't need to be that way.

&gt;Grieving kids act out in all kinds of irrational ways 

truth, but i see no grieving in these episodes so there is no justification for her attitude

furthermore, the last outlash from Angie is the most unwarranted. when she's speaking with the military leader and Clara comes looking for Angie. Clara simply shouts her name and comes running, but Angie just immediately see's red and screeches about how Clara is always showing up to ruin everything. What the fuck? When at all has Clara ruined anything, especially in the last 10 minutes? How is any of that justified at all? It's not.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again:

If the fate of the multi-verse is at stake, the Doctor will win, and nothing much will matter. The alternative is for it to be the final episode of the series, forever. Even if a paradox undoes the explosion, ultimately the episode ends with nothing changed.

If the village is at stake, then everyone can die, and the Doctor can do nothing but leave, and try to deal with the aftermath. Even if he mostly wins, you can get episodes like Vincent and the Doctor where the ""monster"" is defeated, but the Doctor doesn't save anyone.

For a while during Moffat's first season in charge, people seemed to think that he as actually going to go for the ""small"" problems, rather than the ""blow up the universe"" problems, and praised him for it. Then suddenly he discovered that blowing up the universe was cool, after all.

&gt; The latest season of DW has felt like a bunch of two-dimensional one-off stories that have nothing to do with anything, except at the end someone says ""doctor who?"" Or he wonders aloud why Clara is impossible.

Moffat is, apparently, afraid that we'll forget to be excited about the grand finale if he doesn't have the little ""remember the big plot"" line at the end of every episode.

&gt; If you feel this is as good as seasons 1-4 or even 1-6, I'm happy for you...

The best part of Bad Wolf was that it *wasn't* shoved in our faces at the end of every episode. Even ""vote Saxon"" wasn't all that badly done. Somewhere along the line, someone got the idea that things like that were the only way to do season-long arcs. Ever since, people have been obsessing over every continuity error and plot hole as the great clue to the finale.

It's not making the show better.

&gt; except at the end someone says ""doctor who?"" 

That's a very old joke.

Unless he turns out to be Steve, we all know that the answer is going to be said off-screen, or whispered to another character, and there will be endless gags about how that actor knows the answer.

Clara won't actually be explained, because there will be a mysterious force behind her existence, but she has a tight skirt, so no one will really care.

If there is an explanation, it will be a repeat of the ""Rose looked in the heart of the TARDIS"" thing where Clara jumps in and gets split through time to follow the Doctor - not to mention she's perfectly ordinary, but became special because the Doctor picked her up, and he picked her up because she was special. Or, in effect, a repeat of the ""Bad Wolf means nothing, but was the phrase Rose chose because it was the phrase she had seen"" paradox. But I'm *really* hoping I'm wrong about that, and we just get a ""there's a mysterious force following the Doctor around"" that will probably be the Great Intelligence.

tl;dr I'll watch it, but I don't expect to be impressed.

Saville was a celebrity who was never convicted, or even accused by anyone in that force area whilst he was alive.
He spent his time and used his reputation to promote crime prevention schemes, much as celebrities promote many things on a daily basis. This in itself does not suggest impropriety on the part of WYP officers that met him or were friends.

If the incidents were not reported then there can be no coverup.

As for the mention of rumours not being acted on; by fuck, nobody would be employed anywhere if that was decided based on the rumour mill. It's ridiculous to suggest decisions be made on rumour at that level, in a country where we ALLEGEDLY pride ourselves on FACT when considering matters of justice.

    why would the TARDIS recognise her self and yet at the same time not be able to comprehend such a small part?

Wibbly wobbly.

*unacceptable*

    If Claras mom is so important, why has she hardly even been mentioned?

For the same reason Amy's mom and dad weren't mentioned much.

*and where were amys mom and dad pointed to for being entirely important to the structure of the plot?*

    But the evidence presented for this argument isn't sufficient and seems over-thought.

Sounds like every fan theory, ever.

true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"He has all the makings of a top-notch striker, and I don't see how anybody could, at this stage, argue that signing him wasn't a good move. 

 He's got pace, strength and agility combined with a demonic shot, fantastic control and the ability to pick out a bloody good pass when he wants to. 

  When he first joined us he hit the ground running, and he was playing fantastically with Suarez. He's already shown that he can play in a partnership with Suarez or on his own, and with Borini now looking pretty sharp I think we'll see him playing more next season. What we have to remember is that when Borini was injured, Suarez and Sturridge were really our only strikers. Playing them both in every game without an alternate striker of sufficient class on the bench was both a tactical risk and an injury risk.

  He won't play every game next season - sometimes we'll need to play a more closed up game and in those instances Suarez will get the nod ahead of him as the lone striker. But in most games we'll be playing the fluid, open style that Rogers prefers, and I expect to see Sturridge playing alongside Suarez with Borini on the bench. The chemistry that has already developed between Suarez, Sturridge and Coutinho could see us scoring a hell of a lot of goals next season, especially with a couple of new faces coming in over the summer to fill a couple of potentially weak areas at the back and out wide.

  Personally, I think Sturridge and Coutinho, in terms of value, are two of the best signing we've made in the last ten years, possibly in the last fifteen.",0,1368406655,null,0,false,0,c9xl3ky,t3_1e759j,t1_c9xl3ky,t3_1e759j,null,1431213662,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I have not attended uni yet, I am going in September, however I can speak for the uk and based on open days etc.

There will doubtless be the odd twat around however I like to think that as a nation we are incredibly accepting. Universities love foreign students and if you choose to go to a bigger uni you will be far from the only American.

If you are attending undergrad it is inevitable you share classes with a 18-19 year old majority in your first year, this is unavoidable. However people of all ages may attend university here and many of the post-grad students will be around your age. When you apply for accommodation in your first year you may select an option staying the age range you wish to share with. If you do this you may find you are living and befriending other mid-20s people.

I don't see your age or nationality as any reason at all not to come here. Our education is fantastic and if you get teased a bit this will be mostly friendly as is part of the culture. It will cost you £9000pa tuition and roughly £5000pa for accommodation and our government will only provide loans to uk nationals. Private companies do exist though for this.

Is there any particular uni or course you are interested in? People here will be able to tell you lots about everything.

If you do decide to apply you will end up doing it through www.ucas.ac.uk
This also contains all the info you could possibly need.

Hope you found this at least mildly useful.",0,1368407180,null,0,false,0,c9xl9k7,t3_1e7pvn,t1_c9xl9k7,t3_1e7pvn,null,1431213584,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

And, we were being managed by a club legend who, though he had his issues as a tactician, was trusted and loved by the players, and was doing a rather good job figuring things out on the fly.

Fast forward to last week. In a crucial match against cross-town rivals Tottenham, sitting on a draw in the 80th minute, Rafa pulled off Oscar, who was playing extremely well, for Yossi Benayoun, who was completely unlikely to put us back on top in a game that we probably deserved to win. Winning put us through to the Champions League for sure and pretty much wrapped up third.

Let me reiterate. Rafa is probably the only manager in the world who would rather have Yossi Benayoun on the pitch for the last ten of a decisive match than Eden Hazard, Frank Lampard, Demba Ba, or, you know, anyone who was likely to score.
