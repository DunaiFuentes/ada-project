However, I don't have anything more than what amounts to a failed A-level (dropped out due to illness) . Why are so many employers requiring an arbitrary number of UCAS points to even be considered for an interview? 

On top of my good marks:

- Held down an IT job for 2 years during my studies. 
- Been selected for and completed an IAESTE internship as a developer in China. 
- Will likely have a paper on my undergraduate project published before graduation. 

The only thing I lack is a real portfolio, but I'm putting one together.  What gives with the UCAS shit?

Also, the Emperor didn't want to be noticed or found out nor did he want to blow up the entire planet with people on it over one Cyberman. It wasn't until the end when things were looking desperate, after the entire army was revealed, and everyone was sort of in one area that he could do it without risking killing innocent people. So while we do accept the fact that somehow the cyber army stayed hidden is ridiculous for the most part, it's also possible because humans do fuck shit up all the time. As for the Emperor, pretty much everything is explained in this: 1) He was staying hidden so not even the big ship and everyone knew where he was or who, 2) While he easily could have used that bomb at any time, it wasn't until everyone was in one place and things were at their worse with 3 million Cybermen that it was possible to do both detonate the bomb and save everyone, 3) errors happen and cybermen are rather clever now and managed to avoid being noticed for 1000 years so ""deactivating"" or keeping a small piece of cyber tech is completely possible, that or we retract back to people fuck up or both.

true,Jarsdel,null,null,"&gt;If Britain walked away entirely—the most extreme scenario—it would quickly see some benefits. The country would no longer have to transfer funds to the EU to subsidise farm incomes or poorer regions. Treasury figures suggest it would be £8 billion ($13 billion) better off each year. Food could become cheaper. Under WTO rules, countries may slash import barriers unilaterally as long as they do not favour some countries over others. Britain could do this for agricultural produce. It would regain control over fishing rights around its coast.

Where do I sign?

&gt;Switzerland does business with EU countries through bilateral deals, and by routinely aligning its regulations with those made in Brussels. To an extent, it can pick and choose. In the same position, Britain could drop some irksome labour rules. It could also move to co-operate more, and trade more freely, in some areas than in others. Switzerland has a comprehensive bilateral agreement with the EU covering trade in goods, but no equivalent agreement for financial services.

Switzerland shows just how good we'll be able to get it: it's a tiny market almost entirely dominated by the EU which surrounds it. We, a major European power that trades the world over, and sell less to the EU than it to us, have many times the bargaining power of Switzerland.

If the Swiss have a good deal, ours shall be outstanding. A good complement for the outstanding trade we'll be able to engage in with the rest of the world.

&gt;but you should find it fairly balanced

That I did not. The author engages in blatant and transparent scaremongering, with weasel words (a good deal is ""optimistic"", not being in is ""scratchy""), suggesting it would be harder for us to make deals than Switzerland because we're a larger country (what?), and pretending we wouldn't be allowed back into an organisation that contemplates members who don't even recognise each others existence.

Not true; if we leave will will only have to follow our own rules, except when selling abroad, where we will have to meet the rules of wherever we're selling to. If we sell goods to Canada, we'll have to meet Canadian rules for those goods. If we sell services to Japan, we'll have to meet Japanese rules for those services. If we sell something to an EU member, we'll have to meet its rules and EU rules, like we currently do for all our goods and services, even those we're selling into non-EU countries, or selling domestically.

&gt;the EU is an economic superpower

No it isn't; it's a few states, some of which are major economies, and all of which are damaging their economic prospects by binding themselves together. Economies are more powerful when unbound, as we should be.

&gt;with the potential to be a military one in the future

Do we really want or need to be part of a European military force? The EU will never have an army, only the goodwill of NATO, which we'll still be a member of when we leave the EU, just like America, Canada and Turkey are.

&gt;Do we REALLY want to suddenly find ourselves in competition with such an entity

Why would we be in competition with it? That's like telling Canada it had better become the 51st state, else it'll be in competition with the most powerful military on earth.

&gt;Whereas if we're within the EU, not only do we benefit

How, exactly, do we benefit? What benefit of membership will we be unable to get outside it?

&gt;but we can work on subverting it to our will (as every other country tries)

A pretty shoddy job we've done so far.

true,averyCOYS,num28,,"Here are my exact thoughts - 
 When you look at who we have out there, Bale is the right man for the job. He's been with the club for long enough and has started leading the lads even without the armband. If you watch to his interviews, you can tell how much he understands about the game and about football(undoubtedly due to how close he's gotten with Andre), and it is almost like having a manager out on the pitch; and extension of AVB. Also, as this season has gone on we have seen Bale become the most popular and talked about player in the world, and no matter how much attention/comparisons and awards he's received, he has always been so humble about everything, especially in giving the credit to his team and Andre. This kid has grown into a man and there is no doubt in my mind that the armband deserves to go from Michael to Gareth. 

There's only one problem. Time.

How long is Gareth going to stay with us? Is he going to stay this summer if we make the CL? Is he going to stay if we dont? I think it's safe to say he is staying this summer regardless. Is he going to leave next summer if we don't win the CL(gonna be a hard task). What about us finishing/not finishing in the top 4 next season? Will he stay then? 
The thing about giving someone the honor of strapping on that armband every game, is you have to know they will be on your squad for years to come. There is absolutely no way we can take away the armband from Daws next season if Bale ends up leaving. Andre must be completely sure that Gareth wants to stay here for years. 

In conclusion: Do I agree with your post about him deserving to be captain next? Yes I do, which goes hand in hand with Kaboul possibly replacing Daws in the next couple seasons.

No one said she had to be ""all sweetness and light"".  I just found her to be overly annoying and didn't buy anything about her performance.  I mean the scene where she screams ""I hate you!"" to the Cyberman was laughably bad.  Screenwriting 101 is that an annoying kid will kill your project.

Also, in your counter arguments you are basically adding elements that weren't really present in an attempt to justify the poor quality of the character.  I shouldn't have to care that a lot of scenes with the kids were cut out, because what remained onscreen should have been enough.

Neil decided to just skip the formalities of establishment and just get us to the parts he knew we wanted: new Cybermen, the Doctor's battle with himself, etc. Also seeing as the children will (hopefully) only be around/important this once there wasn't really need for introductions. We knew what was going to happen, mine as well just get to it.

I felt as if the episode began to go at a normal pace around when one of the women in the troupe was looking for the Cyberman in the basement of somewhere. Once that happened it seemed to slow down to normality.

But yes I agree the beginning felt lackluster as far as establishment goes. Again, that's been the entire season though.

This is the thing, why must they? Why would they suddenly now after all this time? There's absolutely no indication that this will EVER happen, at least in the foreseeable future.

And I guess that is where we differ in opinion - because from what I've seen of the EU, it has gone from being not very democratic to gradually more democratic as time has gone on. We have more elected representatives in Europe now than in the past. I think that with the EU we may finally even get a government that actually represents the people well even if it does end up being far more centralised.

Of course I may just be wishing - but then I'd say you are too if you think our national politics are going to be reformed suddenly after 100s of years. I pretty much completely and entirely gave up on our electorate after the joke that was the AV referendum.

Looking back over the last three seasons, two names keep popping up on generally-thought-of bad episodes: Toby Whithouse and Chris Chibnall. They did ok in series 5; Whithouse wrote Vampires of Venice and Chibnall wrote The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood. Both were decent enough.

In series 6, Whithouse wrote The God Complex. An episode I thought had potential in the first act then compeltely fell apart and disappointed thereafter. Chibnall didn't write this series.

Now in 7, Whithouse wrote A Town Called Mercy which I also thought had a good concept but just didn't deliver. Chibnall wrote Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and The Power of Three, again another two episodes that were generally not liked that much.

Then of course there's Gatiss. Victory of the Daleks, Night Terrors (which I've seen a lot say is the worst episode of the reboot), Cold War, and the Crimson Horror. VotD wasn't TERRIBLE but wasn't good either, and his series 7 stuff is meh.

Honestly the only good steady writer is Moffat. The episodes that most consider good or great have been guest writers. If that's the case, then I agree with you in saying it's mostly the writing.

Chelsea paid 18m for an 18 year old Lukaku and had another team sold Sturridge they would have made a whole lot more money but Chelsea let their players go generally cheaper so Liverpool got a bargain.

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"Contrary to what others have said in this thread, you *can* start watching at the current Doctor. Despite the huge back catalog, one of the great things about Doctor Who is one of the qualities that has helped the show survive so long: It's extremely accessible. You can jump in practically anywhere without much knowledge of back story other than the premise of the show. 


I do agree that you should start with the revival series, 2005 and onward. Classic Who is cool and all, but it really shows its age and might not appeal as much to newcomers. Also, to clear up a potential point of confusion, seasons of classic Who are referred to as ""Seasons"", while those of modern Who are referred to as ""Series"", e.g. ""Season 7"" would be from the old show, ""Series 7"" would be from the new.


Obviously stay away from season finales (as well as mid-season finales, which are only episodes 6 and 7 of this current series and the previous) and the back ends of multi-part episodes, but other than those you shouldn't have any problem getting into it. 

If you just want to get caught up with the current story arc on TV right now, start with the 2012 Christmas Special, then watch on up to the current episode. *Technically* the current arc begins with the first episode of this series, but it's so close to the end of the previous arc and the references to it are of such minor importance compared to how much it could potentially spoil of the previous companions' arc (unless next weeks episode changes something). Unless you don't care about that sort of thing, then go ahead and watch that one. Starting with the Christmas episode will give you the gist of the story element at the core of series 7b (the current run). If you want to watch more of the current Doctor, his episodes begin with series 5 (2010). 

If you want to *really* get into it, start with the 9th Doctor at the beginning of the revival from series 1. I think it's alright, but a lot of people say it's a bit rough going and it's kind of cheesy (and some of them definitely are), but it picks up. He's only around for the first series, which isn't much in the long run. That's why I'd recommend sticking it out, you might as get the whole picture.


The Tenth Doctor is really popular on this subreddit, which I think is because he's the one a lot of people came into the show in. He lasts from series 2 through series 4+. When you watch through his run, remember that there's five more episodes past the season finale of series 4. The last two are essential to close out his run.

One last thing is there's a drastic change in the show's feel from series 4 to series 5. The reason behind this is the entire production team and cast change, resulting in the change in style of the show. I think they're both good in their own right, but it seems to be a divisive topic among some people in this subreddit.

&gt;Technically, each fragment is part of a whole so even though the pieces are at different points of time and space, they should be “leading” the same lives. Hence why they would all have a daughter named Clara.  That’s why she keeps popping up in all these different places.

Especially this.

 I didn't have it all figured out exactly like that; there are a couple of variations, but I do think Clara is/part of the TARDIS, especially since

* the TARDIS ""always took him where he needed to be""...sort of like Clara was always where the Doctor needed to be. 
* We've seen the TARDIS be human-y before so it's not totally out of the realm of possibility. 
* And with the leaf thing...isn't the TARDIS like, infinite possibilities? 
* The TARDIS might not like her because it's short-circuiting (there can only be one TARDIS and I think she may be a bit of the jealous type!)
* Clara seems to be a caretaker cropping up throughout space and time, and that sort of seems to be the role of the TARDIS as well. It takes care of the Doctor as much as it takes care of the world.

Any cuts that have been made have been incredibly minimal and we're still running a monumental deficit (which was predicated upon unsustainable stimulus prior to the crisis). Your post is, quite frankly, ridiculously biased. New-Keynesian models of expansionary consolidation remain relevant and there's solid empirical evidence to back up consolidation arguments from papers by Alesina and Perotti for example.

The problem is that, as you completely ignored while answering the question, we're in the midst of a global recession where our major trading partners are also conducting austerity (albeit minimal) and facing demand contractions, harming our exports and making sterling depreciation very difficult.

In short, your post is deliberately ignorant and as someone with an undergrad and masters in economics, I don't think you should be making such broad statements as to what is accepted as consensus in economic theory. There are conditions under which expansionary consolidation is very much possible, whilst sovereign risk from debt is not some random idea plucked out of thin air, debt is an issue and risk premia on that debt will rise when that debt is not tackled.

Honestly, I'm not really sure why I've even bothered to reply to that drivel. You've grabbed a few news articles and apparently never read anything other than maybe glancing at Reinhart and Rogoff to see why they were wrong. But I'm sure you'll still reply with a bunch of talking points and tell me that I'm some crackpot conservative who just doesn't understand things in the way you do.

 The truth is, I'm just an objective onlooker who's spent 5 years of my life immersed in this crisis and I'm sick of seeing people like you wilfully ignore a massive literature on austerity and sovereign risk premia.

Referring to the original context, I would consider Wembley a poor example because pressure to leave the old Wembley alone was not successful.  A new stadium was built and it is now considered sentimentalism or nostalgia to complain it's not as good as the old one.  There has been no decline in attendance (capacity has increased after all) and football is as popular as ever.  If we are to draw parallels to Wembley, the parallel conclusion, that the space will be redeveloped and people will move on, runs counter to the OPs viewpoint and thus seems a conflicted analogy (since you could walk to the new skate park from the old one quicker than you could walk from one end of Wembley to another, I don't the change in site a flaw).

If I was constructing this argument, I'd pick an example of redevelopment where capacity decreased (since that seems to be a complaint of the proposed site) or led to decreased participation, success or community.

I suspect it wouldn't be as simple as that.  Homoeopathy has quite a long history, with a relatively interesting back story which I think people buy into; this might be one of the reasons why patients go for it.  They believe it will work for them, and it's almost as if the *real* medical value from the long consultation and exploration of various issues is then cemented by giving a ""remedy"" at the end.  

As you say, it's little more than a placebo, but arguably it *would* be lying to patients to just give them a sugar pill and tell them it was something else.

You wouldn't want Bale to go in for tackles to rally our troops when things not going so well and give up his position on the field where he can do a lot more damage if given the chance.

I mean, I'm not saying that Gareth isn't a strong personality in the dressing room, but I've seen a lot of interviews with Kyle W and JD who've said that Gareth is very immature. Not captain like right there.

A good captain is a naturally determined organiser, I'd say. So Ledley, Gallas, Dawson, players with experience who will and have put their teams needs above that of their own. Again, I'm not saying Gareth wouldn't do that, but still.

I think the humble thing is proof that he's not such a vibrant player in the dressing room. It's like, the captain is the manager on the pitch, so naturally, a defender, an organiser, a keeper would suit the role more so than an attacker, especially when Gareth has so many defenders to handle, you'd almost rather he focused on grabbing that goal than the rest of the team.

Captains set an example. When G-Baz was 'falling over slightly more aggressively than usual' these past two seasons, that's never a good thing. 

You have those classic Redknapp quotes about Parker, because he's perfect captain material. ""Puts himself about... puts his body on the line... he's everywhere... 'trific.""

I never said otherwise.

But locking someone up for 10 years is all punishment and no rehab.

A more sensible balance is needed, and frankly, in what way is society served by locking up a person for so long, when they carried out one crime and will probably never ever commit a crime in their life again?

What you also have to consider is that when a person is jailed, they are not the only person who suffers. Their friends and family are also punished. It does not serve society to punish innocent bystanders any more than absolutely necessary.

My cynical side is anticipating that next week's episode will feature someone attempting to assassinate the Doctor, the creation of a pocket alternate universe, and the Doctor pulling a loophole out of his ass to avoid being killed. ;)",0,1368431232,null,0,false,0,c9xrw78,t3_1e83ey,t1_c9xrw78,t1_c9xpsdi,null,1431175215,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

true,Verochio,null,null,"I’m not sure how things are done in the US, but in the UK you don’t have “a” (single) credit rating. Although companies like Experian and Equifax like to provide you with one, this will – in the most part – be completely ignored by lenders (unless they are particularly small). Each lender will build their own score cards, based on whatever variables *emerge* from a statistical analysis of **their own** past customers. As each lender generally attracts different types of people, it’s not impossible that you get a score of 999/1000 with one lender whilst getting a score of 400/1000 with another. Some things will affect your score with most lenders: missing payments is the key one. I really wouldn’t worry about what you are doing.

With credit cards (and overdrafts to some extent) banks don’t actually want the highest rated customers, as they just pay off the balance in full each month, so the bank can’t charge any interest or fees. The perfect customer (from the bank’s perspective) is one who runs a high balance, pays off only the minimum amount each month, and occasionally (but not consistently) misses a payment by a few days, so the bank can slap on a dirty great big fee. This is the person (at least pre-credit-crunch when I worked in the sector) most likely to be accepted for a credit card, not the person with the highest credit rating.

I'm guess that's because there are so many of them, it's a cut throat market, and being courteous just gets thrown out the window.

I'm looking for a job again, and what I see is most agencies contact me, discuss what I'm looking for, arrange an interview. I attend interview, suspect it didn't go so well or just not sure and... that's it. No feedback, no further contact with agency. I try phoning and they're on the other line etc.

OK, I get that agencies might be busy, but really? You guys can't make a short phone call to say, sorry no joy?

Some agencies do get back to me and let me know where I went wrong. They're the ones I like to deal with. They are sadly in a minority.

Some agencies contact me, take my details and... disappear never to be heard from again. That's quite common.

One email I received asked me to contact somebody to discuss career 'for free'. That brought up a red flag - 'free'? Never, ever pay for arranging interviews and why couldn't the person in question contact me directly themselves?!?

Another agency recruiter - who came across as a high pressure salesman - asked me to be exclusive with his agency - he could guarantee an interview with a few clients within a few weeks. I declined, he said he could not pass on premier employer details to me as a result. He said he would send me an email - I never heard from him again.

One agency asked me for references, so I would appear more attractive to companies. Really? So far, this has never been an issue, so I declined. Also most companies won't give out personal references anymore - instead they refer you to HR and will give out a generic ""yes he worked here"" reference.

Then there's LinkedIn. I've had a few contacts through LinkedIn, but never found a job through them. I often wonder if being on LinkedIn is a waste of time. It really is annoying when agencies do one of the following:

* contact you, ask you to add them as a connection
* ask you if you know anyone else who might be interested to contact them

LinkedIn tells us to only link to a person if you know them. Being contacted by email is not really knowing anyone. The real reason why anyone would do that is they want access to your list of connections to  contact people about jobs.

We lost an important game, and haven't really performed consistently well this season - but that shoulnd't be a reason to freak out and start sacking.  I think this calls for a shake up - sure, but of players.  

If we're building a world class team, we need to look at some of the players we've brought in - and some we haven't let go.  

Kolarov, Maicon, Lescott, Sinclair, Rodwell, Barry, Milner, Garcia, Dzeko etc. These guys are *good* players without a doubt.  I think Milner especially always shows 100% effort which is fantastic, but are they world class?  This is maybe a team that can win a championship if they all perform well - but in Europe?  Imagine this team agasint the current Bayern.  

I think two things need to happen: 

* Some players need to leave, and some new ones in to bring a new dynamic to the team - bring back the spark. 
* Some players need to have a long hard look at their attitudes.  Watching Bayern in the Champions League really highlighted some of the 'areas-for-development' some of our midfield has (not just them though) Yaya Toure, Silva, and a few others have been woeful at important times this season in tracking back, putting in a shift to help the team out.  This was really obvious in the final.  Seeing Ribery, Roben (CL) and others chasing back, putting in tackles and harrying just outside their own box before exploding back up the pitch to attack was amazing.  Why have we not got this?  Why is *fitness* something that's an extra for some payers?  

I think there are questions to be asked - *mostly from the squad, not the manager* - and I think Mancini **needs** to stay. ",0,1368435601,null,0,false,0,c9xsg8t,t3_1e7iv2,t1_c9xsg8t,t3_1e7iv2,null,1431174952,4,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,4

true,megamouth2,null,null,"I'm a Londoner born and bred, and I've been in relationships with two people from the US in my time. One of them had a British father and a mother from the US, and had lived in New York since birth, before moving to London at around 18 or 19 to live on her own, do her A-Levels, and go on to do a medical degree.

The thing with us Brits is that we do have a tendency to make a joke out of everything we see. To us, it's a bit of harmless fun, but judging from what I've heard, this now-ex-girlfriend of mine feels very intimidated by people who do things like talk about her accent, imitate her accent, or bring up other things about her being from the US. As I said, we don't really do it to attack people... we just do it to have a laugh, and don't mean to be rude in any way.

That being said, there is a *huge* difference in the cultures between the US and the UK. In the UK, we tend to be a bit more reserved. If something's wrong, rather than yelling about it, we'll probably just clear our throat loudly a couple of times, and if we get no assistance, we'll probably write an angry letter/blogpost/tweet about it when we get home. People from the US seem more open... and judging from what I've heard [and I mean this in the best possible way, I promise], they like to talk a lot. There's nothing wrong with that, of course - I love to talk, and sometimes human interaction is the best thing in the world. But people from the US seem a bit more... 'public' about it. Obviously, I can't generalise this to absolutely everyone, but lots of people in Britain tend to be more reserved in public. That doesn't mean, of course, that everyone has to be completely silent and stiff in public, but means that we tend not to 'air our dirty laundry' near the prying eyes of others. From what I've found, people from the US seem happy to talk about anything at any time in any place. And, if I'm honest, in a way, I admire that. If we point out any of these cultural differences, again, we're not trying to be mean. We're just either attempting to make a joke out of it, or we're just trying to point a few things out about our culture.

I, personally, don't believe in the stereotypical person from the United States. That is to say that I know that not everyone from the US is rotund, ignorant, and is perpetually yelling ""SPRING BREAAAAK"" at the top of their lungs. Granted, there are some people who must've hit every branch of the stupid tree on the way down, but that happens in every country and every community. Just like assholes: in any community, you'll have a few people who let down the rest of group -  and if you see any of those people who do act like complete and utter douchebags here, please don't judge us all based on their weirdness.

At the same time, we'd be grateful if you didn't believe all the stereotypes about us. No, we don't wear bowler hats, monocles, and use canes all the time. We don't jump off the train and immediately break into song about the station we've alighted at. We don't all drink tea, and we don't all say ""pip-pip, old boy, thanks for a spiffing meeting! TALLY-HO!""  [Sorry for shattering any dreams you *may* have had, there - but you'd've realised soon enough!]

No.
&gt; Are pints affordable without collateral up front? 

It depends on where you go. Central London might be a bit pricey, but I'm sure if you head to the London suburbs, you'll be able to buy a few beers without needing to re-mortgage your house. 

OH! Also, if you're drinking with other people, make sure you know and adhere to the drinking system they're using. If you're doing the whole 'rounds' thing, don't miss your round [there are a few other rules that were covered in a post somewhere before... I'll try and dig it out]. If you're doing the whole 'everyone buys their own drinks' thing, you're good to go. 

&gt; I asked about a diner where I used to get bacon sandwiches and sausage with beans from two elderly English women whose family had run the business for generations; I was told that it's been replaced by something like a fusion Israeli-Japanese-French concept restaurant.

That's okay, you can now change it up a little and get a snail-sushi sandwich with a slathering of humous.

&gt; Will I need a monocle for my monocle?

No. Though you might need a tache for your tache and tea for your tea. But you can cross those bridges when you get to them.

**EDIT:** [Here's the 'rounds' system I was talking about](http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/yu21u/hello_rireland_im_a_17_year_old_sophomore_at_a/c5zdtxm).

Independent of other purposes of a prison system, I hope we can all agree that one important aspect of any such system is the protection of the law abiding public - to which the reoffending rate is important.

So if we look around the world for the systems with the lower re-offending rates, is that a good way to find an 'effective' prison system?  I would argue that it is.

Which brings me to Norway: http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people

It appears to me that if the prison system itself see itself as an instrument of punishment, you end up with higher re-offending rates than when it sees itself as an instrument of reform.  There is no doubt that being sentenced to prison is a punishment (that of depravation of liberty), but that does _not_ mean that the sentence need to be made as punitive as possible.

(I note, for example, that the US reoffending rate is about 60%, and has a higher focus on punishment that the UK system, which has a 50% average rate).

So, ro ask a direct question: Assuming my observations stand rigorous analysis, there is a trade off between low reoffending rates, and a punitive prison system.

 I became a dependent alcoholic ( dependent is when it becomes dangerous to stop drinking ) after years of heavy drinking and drugs in the music business, it reached a head in March when I had a month off after touring and I drank myself stupid, it just turned into a major, way out of control issue. I just literally couldn't stop. 

Hadn't left the couch for two weeks apart from going 100 meters to the shop to buy more booze and became seriously ill  ( like, I was dying seriously ill, my liver was failing amongst other things )  my girl dragged me down to Paddington A&amp;E as she'd had enough, I personally couldn't see a way out. Rehab was way too expensive to do it privately, like £4000/week and NA just hadn't helped at all. 

Not only did they decide to help me ( they really didn't have to )  they moved me to Charing Cross hospital , decided to keep me under observation for two weeks and completely detoxed me on Librium. Possibly the hardest and scariest thing I've ever done in my life by a long shot. I could write a book about it. 

Haven't had a drink since and I've completely turned my life around. Went to another publicly funded [alcohol and drugs program](http://www.wdp-drugs.org.uk/) afterwards and totally sorted my shit out. I'm now fit, healthy, motivated and never been so driven in my life. Every time I think about booze and what it can do I feel sick. 

If I'd have tried to do this privately or we had a private system in this country I wouldn't be writing this now. That's about the size of it. 

FTR: I'm not asking for sympathy and/or any understanding here, it was completely my own fuck up, but as I said, they were under no obligation to help me out what so ever.  

Yet they did.

Plus everyone in work pays a 7.2% tax on their first 30 grand odd to pay the companies which have to carry the highest risk individuals (insurance companies can't turn down people with pre-existing conditions).  But there are numerous problems.  There are always those who won't or can't insure themselves despite the laws and fines imposed. Also, insurers will provide the basic package but refuse to insure or load the premiums for risky customers beyond that, so many people with pre-existing conditions get the bare minimum cover or pay through the nose.  The Dutch medical insurance market is also clearly oligopolistic.  Many Dutch people are surprised that their system garners the plaudits it does because they view it as slow and expensive.  Loads more about it [here](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/27/3/771.full), because the US were looking at it when they were rejigging their own system.

The German model is also problematic - it's more expensive than our own system and comes in a number of places lower on the WHO health care rankings (we're 18, they're 25).  They've also got growing numbers of uninsured people (several hundred thousand now), their sickness funds often run large deficits despite being supposed to be self-financing, they also have run-away costs and there are estimates it'll take 30% of GDP by 2020 and the government has been cutting back on coverage and introducing copayments as a consequence.

&gt; They also affect countless other areas such as emissions (which is a total waste of time if America and China aren’t cutting theirs) it forces shops to use metric meaning some staff have to be retrained, wasting money for no logical reason.

Emissions are hardly a waste of time, and if there is a problem with China and the US that's a separate issue. Metric is what we should all be using, the cost of ""retraining"" staff to know what a kilogram is is fucking trivial.

We can, if they're not being sent back to be tortured. It is only in extreme cases that EU law comes into it at all, and in those cases out own laws should be in line with the European ones anyway. Why the hell are we supporting torture by handing people over to the torturers?

true,circlesmirk00,null,null,"lol. There you go; couldn't argue or do your own research, so you reverted to talking points. Ignore the fact that we haven't ""front-loaded"" austerity, ignore points about default risk, and then make me do the legwork because you're too lazy. Here's some of the key references in the literature, presented harvard style because you're clearly one for rigorous academic study:

* Corsetti, G., Kuester, K., Meier, A., &amp; Müller, G. (2011). Sovereign risk and the effects of fiscal retrenchment in deep recessions.
* Giavazzi, F., &amp; Pagano, M. (1990). Can severe fiscal contractions be expansionary? Tales of two small european countries. In NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1990, Volume 5 (pp. 75-122). MIT Press.

I can't really be bothered to dig up some of the work on sovereign risk premia, but the Corsetti et al. paper summarizes the other literature anyway. 

As I said, there are two sides to the argument. There is also no true consensus although the current understanding is that fiscal consolidation isn't effective in producing growth when everyone else is doing it, but it could well be vital in avoiding significant increases in sovereign risk premia and thus low growth is potentially the lesser of two evils (the view that I subscribe to based on the evidence).

What's entertaining is that this won't change your warped belief of a one-sided debate one bit. You'll still pretend that ""basic economics"" tells you everything you need to know.

EDIT: Use Google scholar if you're struggling to find the papers. Not sure if they're all publicly available, if not, go and do a degree in economics, they'll probably give you access.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;We didn’t get to vote for the president for a start. We have signed plenty of treaties that hand power to the EU without being given a referendum, both extremely undemocratic.

So why not expand the EU in to a more federal like body in which we do vote for the president? Making the EU more democratic is as much a viable answer to this as anything else. The anti EU answer will pretty much boil down to ""but then we might not get our way, what is good for other people might not be good for us"". Which is pretty much a libertarian small government argument and you might as well ask why we don't just run government on a county level and the answer for both is the same, one that has largely been won in British politics which is why so many people who do hold these views are trying very hard to make sure ""it's not democratic"" is only ever framed as ""so we should leave"".

&gt;They also affect countless other areas such as emissions (which is a total waste of time if America and China aren’t cutting theirs) it forces shops to use metric meaning some staff have to be retrained, wasting money for no logical reason. Large parts of the health and safety regulations that come from Brussels are totally ridiculous.

The EU cutting emissions helps give leverage we have for something that *really has to happen* but no lets just give up on a important goal because achieving that goal might be hard to do. 

Metric is a better system and ""retaining"" is a short term one off cost. If it wasn't why the hell did we demicles the pound? The idea that first introduced in *1841* and taken up fully in 1971 two years before we joined the EU. 

Also simply saying ""there is a lot health and safety and that cost money"" is a reason to leave it silly. If that health and safety is a good thing then it's a good thing, if it's not it's not but that isn't an argument either way.

&gt;I agree with that, however if you have no right to be in this country we should be allowed to deport foreign criminals without being dictated to by other countries.

The ECHR was not something we joined because of the EU and it's something we actively sought to put in place. We chose it, it's as much our law as anyone else, the fact that it's part of an international agreement is irrelevant. It's not other countries telling us what to do with our criminals it's how we agreed our criminals should be treated and we agreed to that in a binding way. Again just because something is hard, or inconvenient, is not a reason for leaving it. 

Either everyone has human rights or no one does. Allowing the government to strip someone of those rights because they are a criminal should be terrifying. 

&gt;Why should we? Britain is in a totally different league to countries like Poland. I’d accept this if it was between equal partners like France and Germany, but it’s disgraceful we have to subsides the poorer parts of Europe without being consulted.

As above this could be used as much as an argument for a *more* federal EU. You seem to react to thinking you have too little of a voice is a reason to leave the conversation rather than find a way to speak louder. 

It's worth noting that we, and those you see as ""equal"" partners have a much bigger say in how the EU is run than anyone else. The public may not have been directly consulted but our elected representatives, both in the UK and the EU, have an impact on these. That you don't like the way it's going is just the nature in which what you want is not what the majority of those involved in a given community do.

Secondly, they're still tagged and have the freedoms restricted. As they were in a class D prison this isn't a huge downgrading of their status.

Of course it does.  However, how does that relate to wether a strong focus on rehabilitation (and, indeed, reform) is effective?  That's why it is discussed as a rate of reoffending.  There are probably some people that will never re-offend (no matter the prison regime), and others that will no matter what.  It's the ones in the middle that are reachable that we should be trying to reach - and the evidence is that it is effective.

&gt; ... and we are not Norway nor are we the USA.

I do not understand what your point is.  If you want to dismiss evidence from other countries, you'll have to provide some argument for that.


&gt; ... rehabilitation has failed time and again there and we need to look into protecting the public.

By the Norwegian example, we've barely attempted anything in the way of rehabilitation.  I don't believe that you can say it has failed, when it's not been tried.

&gt; I reject the scenario you lay out as it assumes that longer prison sentences effectively cause crime.

No, it does not.  Nothing I mentioned did anything about the _length_ of the sentence.  It was all about what occurs _during_ the sentence.  You therefore have _not_ addressed my point to you.

Of course most of us would rather they didn't because often feeling upset is a temporary thing, and they will feel better later.

The right to die argument is about people in chronic incurable pain that are not physically able enough to kill themselves.

I guess my frustration is that his minutes come at the expense of Sigurdsson, who I believe is a better all-around player. He hasn't been very productive as a goal scorer this season, but he's also struggled to play significant minutes and I still get the feeling that he's a better dribbler, passer, and shooter than Dempsey.

Climate change is real, and there's evidence for it - I hope you agree with that.

We are responsible for it, and our grandparents are, just as much as the Chinese and the Americans. 

Some photos of Beijing pollution have been posted recently [[1](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/28/the-most-shocking-photo-of-beijing-air-pollution-ive-ever-seen/), [2](http://imgur.com/a/CnXGL)] - a century ago we had such smog throughout the UK. At my school this was taught in GCSE history - in London such smogs were called ""pea-soupers"".

The people of China only want the same things you and I have. We burned billions of tonnes of coal, running steam trains up and down the country and smelting steel in Sheffield, building our economy.

You and I benefit from that today - the lifestyle you want to protect is built upon that. Don't blame Europe, China or America - blame your parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. And mine! My dad thinks that emissions control and environmentalism is nonsense, too!

When we tell China not to burn coal in their power stations, we're telling them they can't have power for their TVs or washing machines. You take these for granted, but these are new luxuries for the people there - many of their citizens still don't have them, and they are hard-won. 

The Chinese feel entitled to the same things you and I have, and we can't simply tell these people they can't have them. We can't say ""we were allowed to burn all that coal, but you can't"".

So the only thing that gives us moral authority over the Chinese is that we're cutting our emissions more than they are. Blimey, half of their emissions are for their factories making the consumer products you and I take for granted, anyway!

I appreciate that we have the ""defence"" that a century ago we didn't have the science to predict the effects of our pollution, but a hungry man doesn't care about such rationalisations.

We need to drag developing countries kicking and screaming, if necessary, into lower carbon emissions. We need to do that any way we can, and setting an example is the first and most important thing.

Climate change has already occurred, and it's irreversible - the only question is how bad it'll get, and nobody knows that. All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. The only question is of how fucked we are.

Saying that we should disregard our emissions just because of China is like shitting in the river because you're mad your neighbour's doing the same thing. Well, that ain't very nice for the people downstream, is it?

true,Owa1n,eng-Cornwall,DPRK,"Firstly these traits produced by breeding and selection are often governed by more than one gene, and yes those genes can cross with others but these genes involved with GM crops aren't always genes we want, with plants breeding/selection processed have usually involved removing the worst of a population rather than trying to cross pollinate, it's easier when pollen has a tendency to go everywhere. But GM crops can have a more immediate effect, example: there is a gene in poplar trees that controls the lignin content of the wood, it also happens to control how fast the tree can grow, some people have altered this gene so that it can grow really fast for use as biomass as they can harvest it quicker. This however, makes the trees really unstable which isn't much of a problem in the forestry rotations as they get harvested before they can fall over but imagine if this gene escaped (there are more factors at work to do with dominance of the gene and whether it is 'switched on' or not) and wild seedlings grew that had this trait of growing really fast but being really weak, the poplar species in question I believe are very common in North America so imagine a number of years after the gene had got out that loads of big trees started falling down of their own accord.

It's granted that this would allow more flexibility, but it's disingenious to assume that we could leave the EU, still have a free trade agreement and then do as we please.  Even other countries that are idealised in the way (Norway) have to abide by some EU directives - and worse still they get no say in them.

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"Where do you get the idea that section 13 only applies to males? It doesn't say anything like that

You're misreading section 9, it defines two offences, one of 'sexual touching' without penetration, the other with penetration. The part with penetration is explicitly defined as either way round.

In your scenario, let's assume we're talking about penis in vagina sex. The 16 year old girl is person A and the 15 year old boy is person B. Subsection two would apply, specifically part c

(2)A person guilty of an offence under this section, if the touching involved—
(a)penetration of B’s anus or vagina with a part of A’s body or anything else,
(b)penetration of B’s mouth with A’s penis,
**(c)penetration of A’s anus or vagina with a part of B’s body**, or
(d)penetration of A’s mouth with B’s penis,is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.

In this case section 9 doesn't apply directly since A is under 18. However section 13 creates a separate (but lesser) offence by stating ""**A person under 18 commits an offence if he does anything which would be an offence under any of sections 9 to 12 if he were aged 18.**""",0,1368451826,null,0,false,0,c9xusel,t3_1e8kmm,t1_c9xusel,t1_c9xulc0,null,1431173851,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; it forces shops to use metric meaning some staff have to be retrained, wasting money for no logical reason. 

I'm pretty sure the only people using imperial these days are vintage car restorers.

If you said that to any engineer or machinist, I'm pretty sure they'd laugh at you. 

If you're weighing your fruit and veg then you're using a digital scales, anyway - pounds and ounces have been scrapped in supermarkets already, it's too late to turn back the clock back now. 

I totally understand the emotional appeal of Triumph motorcycles and imperial units. But it's nostalgia. The idea of pounds, shillings and pence is quintessentially British, but I wouldn't like to be an accountant under such a system, or to write spreadsheet software. 5 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings in a pound, how many farthings is that? 

As it happens, [UKIP issued a statement \(albeit an informal one\) about imperial measures very recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metric/comments/1dxbsf/a_statement_from_the_uk_independence_party/), stating that shopkeepers should have the right to sell groceries in pounds and ounces, should they wish.

Superficially, this should satisfy you, but in reality this would only cost money or harm consumers.

I mean, let's say you're buying carrots, as you do every week for your pet bunnies, and the store offers a 1kg bag at £0.75p and a 3lb bag for £1. Which is cheaper? Can you imagine trying to work that out in your head standing in Tesco with the kids screaming and your car on a parking meter?

Let's consider trading standards and the [weights and measures](http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo) department. Now trading standards officers are going to have to carry two sets of scales and two rulers. Even if you have a single measuring tool with two scales marked on it (and I'm not sure this is enough for proper scientific and legal measurement), then it's going to have to be calibrated twice.

We have standards bodies in place to maintain the accuracy of measurements. If you manufacture rulers or engineers' micrometers then you can calibrate these against a [machined ""prototype""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_National_Length_Meter.JPG) which is recognised as the international standard for being 1 metre long. This is necessary, and a great deal of accuracy is necessary, because of the exacting standards of modern engineering. If you make automotive parts, they need to fit, and they won't fit in a high-performance engine if they're the tiniest fraction out. 

So permitting everybody to use pounds and ounces would require duplicating all that effort, work which is currently shared with all the other metric-using nations in the world. I mean, I guess we could share US infrastructure for this, but it's still going to be more expensive that maintaining a single measurement scale.

The UK metric association's FAQs look very good. I mean, obviously they're going to show their own bias, but they look well thought-out to me. They appear to be advocating further metrification (changing MPH to KPH on your car's speedometer, I guess), so I understand you wouldn't want to go for that. But their points make even stronger arguments, I'm sure, against going back and reviving the imperial units we've abandoned. 

*""Since Magna Carta in 1215 it has always been held to be the responsibility of the state to establish which weights and measures shall be legal for trade and to ensure that the law is enforced. It has not been the case since the 19th century that traders could choose for themselves which units of measurement they could use.""* [[Link](http://www.ukma.org.uk/what-about-free-speech) and [more](http://www.ukma.org.uk/briefing-notes)]

Its like arguing with a bunch of idiots demanding ""More money for everyone"" and anyone who points out that actually that cant and wont work, makes you a cold hearted monster.

true,gauchie,null,null,"I would spend some time looking at the [UKBA website](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/asylum/claimingasylum/) on claiming asylum to familiarise yourself with the process.

I've done some research on rejected asylum claims before and they're usually a result of what the UKBA perceive as incongruities in the story. For example, someone was rejected because they couldn't remember the exact date of a particular Cameroonian election (They had said it was 12 October when it was in fact 21 October). Similarly they may reject you if their 'objective' country of origin information (often out of date or uninformed unfortunately) demonstrates something contrary to what you claim. They also may reject your claim because they have some ridiculous view of how the world works. For example, there was a case of someone (I cannot recall where from) whose claim was rejected because he said that he received medical treatment while in prison and the UKBA's response was that it made their claim of torture incredible because why would a government give medical treatment to someone they tortured?

Looking at the statistics I've previously obtained from the UKBA, only 8 people from Lebanon were granted asylum in 2006-2012. This is out of 349 decisions that were made in that time. Five of those were given [humanitarian protection](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/asylumpolicyinstructions/apis/humanitarian-protection.pdf?view=Binary) which is available to those whose claims do not meet the criteria under the 1951 Refugee Convention but who face a 'real risk' of torture, inhuman or degrading punishment, the death penalty, unlawful killing or a 'serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict'. In short, it does not look like Lebanese applicants have been very successful in claiming asylum or humanitarian protection here. As far as the asylum process goes, having a genuine claim nowhere near guarantees your refugee status. Officers are set arbitrary targets to meet (last I heard it was 70-75% rejections) and given financial incentive to do so. If you have another means of migrating which won't put you through the traumatising process which can last many years with no certainty as to your status not to mention serious poverty as you are not permitted to work I recommend doing so.

I have found an [Operational Guidance Note on Lebanon](http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=4a2fc31e2) which is used by UKBA staff to make decisions on Lebanese claims. However it is from 2009 so I don't know if it has been used before.

I also recommend reading [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/feb/03/gay-asylum-seekers-pressure-prove-sexuality) on the experiences of other LGBT asylum seekers of the British asylum process.

There are other European countries where, according to the UNHCR, Lebanese asylum seekers have been *slightly* more successful: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Sweden. The US and Australia have better rates than any European countries and Canada's appears at first glance to be the best. Of 180 asylum decisions made in 2011 75 were granted.",0,1368454684,null,0,false,0,c9xviwp,t3_1e8pqq,t1_c9xviwp,t3_1e8pqq,null,1431173504,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Both can be equally messy in terms of hair and malting.

You seem to be under the impression that such a relationship is bad. Industry funding provides an incredible source of income for british universities, an invaluable source that helps to cement our place within the world's best research centres. Research undertaken with industry funding is not any different from publicly funded research. It's undertaken by the same scientists in the same buildings in the same labs and has to undergo the same peer review process if it ever wants to see the light of day. The fact is many companies share research interests with academics and hence these partnerships are a natural and very beneficial way of increasing research funding.

Take Shell, for example. There are many scientists in the UK that are interested in sediment dynamics, depositional environments, basin formation, basin inversion, petroleum formation and trapping amongst other topics. All of these things are investigated using grants from government bodies such as the Natural Environment Research Council.

Once we know the characters better (and we still don't really know Clara) the writers can use various forms of ""shorthand"" to communicate scenes in the 1-part episodes.  That's why, in my opinion, the s7p1 with Rory and Amy worked so well, because we knew those characters so well at that point.

I agree that industry finding will of course push research into areas that they are interested in - they would hardly fund research if that didn't happen. But what you're mistaken in is when you say other areas of research *won't* be researched. The government has a finite amount of funding available and that cash is highly competitive! It is given out in a nail-biting review process and only awarded to the absolute best proposals. Rest assured that public money is spent wisely (for the most part) and that money is not wasted! But industry funding means that *more scientists can be employed*. They fund PhDs and post-docs that would *never* be there otherwise. Departments would have half the staff they do now. With more scientists comes more ideas, more collaboration and better science! Our department has something like 45 new PhD students each year but less than half of those are government funded. Those scientists go on to compete for public money and push the boundaries of science in new directions, just like you want.

At the end of Bells, Clara is already hesitant to travel with the Doctor.

Of course, he researches into her life history in between, but she doesn't know that.  
  
Well, she finds out in Rings. And it very nearly scares her off. How would you feel of this very wary character that travels through time and space that, at the first time you met, already knew your name, thinks you know him from the past, guards you like a dog, is secretly stalking your life (think how she remembers he was watching her at her mom's grave), and taking you on adventures that make you sacrifice things you love and constantly puts you in fear of death?

I was with you until this part. Financial services are meant to be regulated and so when ordinary people go to a bank looking for a loan, it's not unreasonable for them to expect the bank and its staff to have specialised knowledge about whether the repayments and other conditions are suited to their circumstances (if not, why do they check your income etc).

Similarly if you went to a builder and asked them to extend your second floor bedroom 15 feet beyond the existing walls of the building, a third party would expect any sensible builder to say ""that's a massively difficult task and will probably have a net negative impact on the property"". Any builder who carries out the work would be exploiting the customer's lack of knowledge. And this potential for exploitation is precisely why industries are regulated.

And even if it wasn't a regulated industry you'd expect the bank to have made the necessary checks because there's something in it for them. They need you to be able to pay them back. That's what they're relying on. They've got safeguards in place in case you don't, but they're not a guarantee and seized assets can be difficult to liquidise for their full amount. 

People rely on the expertise of others because they simply cannot have the knowledge required to make a truly informed decision on everything. If a surgeon removed someone's lungs and then said ""well the patient asked me to do it"" he'd still be responsible for it because he has an obligation to his patients to give them the correct advice. Yes the patient was stupid for asking for their lungs to be removed but the ultimate responsibility lies with the one who has specialised knowledge and has an obligation to use that specialised knowledge.",0,1368461381,null,0,false,0,c9xxlvr,t3_1e8c2z,t1_c9xxlvr,t1_c9xt4e0,null,1431172451,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"**First Team:** Coutinho, Henderson, Kelly, Sterling (as an impact sub), Wisdom (part-time with PL loan next season). 

**Premier League Loan:** Shelvey, Wilson, Coates, Suso

**Championship Loan:** Yesil, Coady, Flanagan, Robinson, Morgan, McLaughlin, Ngoo

**Sell:** Pacheco, Spearing

A few caveats here. I argue for keeping Sterling, as I fear if he is loaned out, he will be vastly overplayed. At home, we can put him on a regime that suits him best. Wisdom, I think, would do well in the Championship, however, his versatility is very welcome and would guarantee enough first team football. If he proves himself, he could go on loan to a PL team next season. 

Ideally, both Flanagan and Robinson would benefit from a PL team loan, nevertheless, I just don't see it happening, in terms of a PL team willing to take them on. So Championship it is. 

Wilson and Coates are, I believe, reaching the 'last chance' stage and so, unless Brendan has first team plans for them, a PL loan is imperative. 

Finally, Pacheco has never really impressed me when playing for the first team and, at his age, it may be time to go. As for Jay, I love him dearly, but I just see him as a liability long-term. Ideally we would want someone who can challenge Lucas for a starting spot in that position.

You can jump in practically anywhere without much knowledge of back story other than the premise of the show. 


&gt;I do agree that you should start with the revival series, 2005 and onward. Classic Who is cool and all, but it really shows its age and might not appeal as much to newcomers. Also, to clear up a potential point of confusion, seasons of classic Who are referred to as ""Seasons"", while those of modern Who are referred to as ""Series"", e.g. ""Season 7"" would be from the old show, ""Series 7"" would be from the new.


&gt;Obviously stay away from season finales (as well as mid-season finales, which are only episodes 6 and 7 of this current series and the previous) and the back ends of multi-part episodes, but other than those you shouldn't have any problem getting into it. 

&gt;If you just want to get caught up with the current story arc on TV right now, start with the 2012 Christmas Special, then watch on up to the current episode. *Technically* the current arc begins with the first episode of this series, but it's so close to the end of the previous arc and the references to it are of such minor importance compared to how much it could potentially spoil of the previous companions' arc (unless next weeks episode changes something). Unless you don't care about that sort of thing, then go ahead and watch that one. Starting with the Christmas episode will give you the gist of the story element at the core of series 7b (the current run). If you want to watch more of the current Doctor, his episodes begin with series 5 (2010). 

&gt;If you want to *really* get into it, start with the 9th Doctor at the beginning of the revival from series 1. I think it's alright, but a lot of people say it's a bit rough going and it's kind of cheesy (and some of them definitely are), but it picks up. He's only around for the first series, which isn't much in the long run. That's why I'd recommend sticking it out, you might as get the whole picture.


&gt;The Tenth Doctor is really popular on this subreddit, which I think is because he's the one a lot of people came into the show in. He lasts from series 2 through series 4+. When you watch through his run, remember that there's five more episodes past the season finale of series 4. The last two are essential to close out his run.

&gt;One last thing is there's a drastic change in the show's feel from series 4 to series 5. The reason behind this is the entire production team and cast change, resulting in the change in style of the show. I think they're both good in their own right, but it seems to be a divisive topic among some people in this subreddit.

Torres: Actually a very good player when you look at it rationally

The truth is chelsea does not employ a system that causes strikers to strive (if you define thrive strictly as scoring goals). When a striker comes to chelsea they'll score less than at most other clubs. They won't contribute to less goals but a higher proportion of our goals come from our midfield. Drogba was the only striker who was able to continue to score a lot of goals at chelsea recently and even he was able to score more than 12 league goals in a season only twice.

Lukaku, torres and Ba are all very talented players and if we got wayne rooney he would play well but he wouldn't score a lot of goals.

I have absolutely no idea why this is, perhaps the silence are not about the name itself at all, but all about removing those who can answer? (ie: can read and wield the power of gallifrey and the timelords)

Thus, anybody who knows it is then a target. This is why the doctor tells everybody to never say it aloud (namely clara), he's protecting them. It's importance is simply that whoever knows it is then in danger from the silence.

EDIT: for clarity; I'm thinking maybe the silence simply want to wipe out the knowledge of gallifrey and those who can read gallifreyan as they posses the ability to then learn how to release the timelock or some other world ending thing. The only way to learn the Doctor's true name is to read it (unpronounceable) or the silence just to want to be on the safe side.

Walker-Dawson-Vertonghen-BAE

Parker-Dembele

Holtby

Dempsey-Bale

Adebayor

Use Defoe, Sigurdsson, and Lennon as game-changing impact subs.

Honestly, Holtby and Sigurdsson can be interchanged and rotated game on a game-by-game basis.

Of course. What would be the point of EU law if parliament could simply override it? The EU does involve a ceding of some sovereignty but it required the same from every country in the Union. Your rights are protected when living, working or trading in the rest of the EU because their governments have ceded some sovereignty too. Parliamentary sovereignty is a nice idea but it's completely impractical and not the reality. There's that old example of if parliament made it illegal to smoke on the streets of Paris it would be illegal in fact because Parliament is sovereign. Obviously in practice you have to eject that sort of idealism if you want to achieve anything in co-operation with other states. In the same way parliamentary sovereignty is an ephemeral pseudo-justification for disliking the EU. Any honest appraisal of the concept shows it doesn't stand up internationally.

I think either Wigan will win or Wigan will lose. A draw seems incredibly unlikely because it's pretty much meaningless to both teams.

Some people have a lot of worry about health, and part of their coping mechanism for everything in life is to medicalise it. The need a therapist to sort out their problems, which for whatever reason they've decide is not something they can cope with themselves. Some people have genuine incapacitating anxiety problems severe enough to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis, but I'm not talking about them. I'm taking about the worried well.

The problem is that these people aren't placated by been given bullshit diagnoses and treatments. They don't then become empowered to solve their problems. Quite the opposite: it reinforces their view that everything wrong with them is something for someone else to explain and solve, and not something they can do on their own.

I disagree. I think it's a tautology. In people without a defined illness if someone wants to kill themselves they are declared mentally ill. There are people who are never going to be happy who have nothing technically wrong with them.

There are people who want to kill themselves who fit the socially acceptable ""ill or disabled"" category who can have their _pain_ treated (even when their disability or illness  _is_ permanent) and there are people who don't fit in that category who can't. But treatability is a totally different argument to a _right to die_ - if we have a right to die it shouldn't matter if I am just going through a bad patch, it shouldn't matter if I'd regret it if I could regret after death - my body my choice.

As OP said, it sort of negates the whole ""running off with a madman in a blue box"" dynamic that has been a staple since day one.  And everything you said is exactly why people run off with the Doctor, because he is exciting, dangerous and unknown. And yeah, puts them in fear of death.  That's the whole point.  

The weekend adventuring thing makes her feel less like a companion and more of a tagalong.  It accentuates the idea that he's only associating with her because she's a mystery he has to solve.  That could be why Moffat is doing it that way, but again, that's not what companions are supposed to be.  They're supposed to be the Doctor's moral compass, the Watson to his Sherlock.  They act as a buffer between him and the cold, calculating, distant nature of the Time Lord and give him the spark of humanity he needs.

It doesn't make her a good companion, and it doesn't really make her character interesting.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;A democracy only works if you have the consent of the governed

What if the governed are misled by an errant press with an agenda to push down our throats? [Here's the blog the Commission is forced to maintain](http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/) to correct the many inaccuracies in the British press about the EU and the sensationalised and misleading stories it prints. 

What if a minor party on the right wing is setting the political agenda and forcing the Conservatives to agree with them to win back voters thereby lending legitimacy to their ideas? Furthermore, what if those ideas are [based on false an misleading claims about the EU](http://www.straightstatistics.org/article/ukip-gets-its-facts-wrong-europe) that mislead the public? 

What if the British people, [to quote the research group Ipsos-MORI](http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/650/UK-On-Europe-Low-On-Knowledge-Low-On-Trust.aspx), 'have low awareness of [and] low knowledge about' EU institutions and what if 'they do not feel they have enough information to make a considered vote in the referendum on the European Constitution'?

What if the British people are so lacking in knowledge and, because of a biased and sensationalist press, unable to get easy access to correct information about the EU that if one were to question the electorate what you would get in a very uninformed and broadly inaccurate response? What do you do then? The public doesn't know the answer; it doesn't have the information nor does it have the understanding and their 'consent' is meaningless even to them and objectively pointless. 

Democracy is the life blood of our country and there is nothing we should encourage more than referendums on important issues but what is the point of a referendum on a subject about which no-one understands and those who think they do have been misled?

Actually, it's one of the few endings in 7B which *isn't* a deus ex machina. Everything necessary for the ending to happen is established over the course of the episode: We know the past, present, and future are crossing paths and can interact with each other. We know the magnatron damaged the TARDIS. We know that the remote controls the magnatron. We even saw the remote control end up in the TARDIS control room at the beginning of the episode. Put those together and the ending falls out.

A deus ex machina ending, OTOH, is one where a solution to the problem appears out of thin air at basically the same moment the problem is solved. Take ""Nightmare in Silver"", for example. ""How are we going to escape?"" ""Turns out I have a 'summon warship that can teleport us to safety' button that has never been mentioned before.""

The Rifles march much, much quicker and do different drill from the rest of the Army and spell sergeant as serjeant. They also call a bayonet a sword. These are  just some regimental traditions they have tipping their hat to their history which is vast and unique.

Well a few quotes and such, one from Napoleon was ""Those men in the green tunics....Oh what i could achieve with 10,000 of them."" and "" I hate those Grasshoppers!"" The name given to the Greenjackets by the French as they would appear behind them, stab them and disappear just as quickly. They were the original makers of modern infantry tactics, from the 1600s!

Also Wellington said ""I know not what they do to the enemy, but Gad sir! They terrify me!""

They're a unique regiment. Have earnt more battle honours than any other unit. More Victoria crosses too. They stole most of the Eagles from the French and were the men who crushed Boney's elite troops in his last roll of the dice. They really are the reason we won in Europe and could then enjoy peace and go out and conquer.

They're the original snipers, first to use a Rifle not a musket (they could hit at 250 yard compared to a musket which would miss at 80), taking out the French generals. 

The Riflemen wore Green Jackets and black buttons not red coats like the rest. Using a bugle and not a drum to communicate something they still wear on their cap badge today.

*They killed a lot of Americans once  and the Americans said they'd get revenge on the perpetrators so they dipped their hackles in the blood of the dead Americans so the Yanks knew who they were.* Nothing came of it.

""On the 20th September 1777 at Paoli, light companies destroyed a vastly superior American force in a daring night attack.  The rebels swore vengeance and decreed than any British soldier involved would be killed – So those Regiments involved dipped their hackles into blood in order to stain them red as a mark of honour and to identify themselves as those responsible for this act –""

Also there's a painting of a Rifleman offering Welly a brew on the morning of waterloo. An odd thing to do at the time but very English.

Not to say in recent history they've been quiet. WW2 Pegasus bridge etc.. They're England's largest infantry regiment now. Currently some are serving in Afghanistan. They've been here before just it was in 1839 last time!

Oh and Margret Thatcher had to apologise to the French prime minister when **two** of them decided on the ferry back from Calais after a few beers that it was now their ship took control and pirated it.

I think it's actually the best episode this season. Unfortunately, that's a low bar to clear.

Overall, it's a pretty solid episode. My problems revolve entirely around the bridge-of-death: You establish that everyone will die if they stay in there too long, but then you stop halfway across to play tour guide? You establish that people can only survive ""for a minute or two"" but then write a seven minute sequence? Your method for avoiding being baked alive is to simply be in a different physical position while still being in the same area that will bake you alive (which is like thinking you won't get baked by an oven as long as you're standing on a different oven rack)? And, finally, a really egregious directing error when the Doctor runs *past* the brother hanging off the edge of the bridge and then yells at the other brother for touching him (despite having just put him in the position of being the only person capable of saving him).

They have been shit all season and if they are shit the last 2 games it is because whatever streak of magic they had last season has completely escaped them this season.

My feeling is that we don't really compete for the same players (remember we looked at and then seem to have passed on Cisse, Ba, Cissoko and Cabaye who they then signed), if we compete with anyone for the same players it seems to be Liverpool and Arsenal. Plus, how many players do you know that line up to go play for a team that is shit unless they are paid a ass-ton of cash (something Newcastle doesn't do)? And if you are trying to compete against other teams every notch in the standings you are up makes chances of you signing someone that much better. So there is limited tactical gain by throwing a game. 

If they lose it is just them being consistent this season.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;you never get an informed electorate

I don't think that's true except in an absolute sense. You may never get an electorate who are experts in the field but you at least need one who understand the institution they're voting on. The people who voted for the NHS knew it would be a health institution funded by taxes; it was simple to understand. The EU is not simple nor does it involve normal UK concepts. It has treaties and regulation and directives all of which are foreign to the average Brit. People don't know how laws are passed, turn outs for European elections are staggeringly low and people are unaware what are laws passed by the EU. People do not understand the EU nearly as well as the understood the NHS. 

And on referendums encouraging knowledge, the NHS referendum was not filled with campaign ads and 24/7 information, not all of which could be checked. That is the case to day. A referendum with encourage those with an agenda to pump money into an OUT campaign to persuade people who don't have enough information to make up their own minds. It's dishonest. We saw it with the AV referendum and it will happen again. Without wishing to resort to personal experience to prove my point as I know it's a poor way to argue but my own mother voted no in that referendum. I asked her if she could explain AV and she did a fairly poor job. It's not a coincidence that she reads the Daily Mail who on referendum day implored their readers to go out an vote no which my mother duly did. The referendum would be a new low in the illegitimacy of democracy. People would be voting for the agendas of a slim group of, as you put it, 'elites' who seek to impose their views on the public. We have a choice between an undemocratic vote or we educate the public and then have a democratic referendum which I will fully support. The public is not informed currently and the 2017 referendum will be a sham if it goes ahead. We may make a huge mistake.

true,reketrebn,null,null,"&gt;you really sound like you have no idea how research works.

That's quite rude - just because I disagree with the way it works now doesn't mean I have no idea how it does work.

I'm well aware of the process for research council grants, as you can see in some of my earlier discussion.

&gt;Can you seriously argue that 18 PhD students moving through a department is better than 45?

Yes, I can.  Too many PhD students means that they do not get the supervision required to help them understand how to do research in a proper and effective manner.  Even if you have enough staff for supervision, how many of those students are really going to go on to become academics or researchers?  By taking on more and more students, you end up increasing the rate of students who leave academia after completing.  It's a well commented upon phenomenon that postgrads are becoming ""cheap labour"" for researchers.  I would much rather have a small number of good students that I could encourage to take up real research, than to have many students that I can use to answer my small problems, but who will go on to other careers afterwards.

&gt;With more scientists comes more ideas, more collaboration and better science!

This is far too generic a statement.  More does not equal better, and moreover, more can sometimes mean worse.  Universities are, whether you like it or not, public institutions.  Is it right that we should be using a public institution to (for example) reverse engineer BMW's just because Mercedes wants to?  This is something that should be done in Mercedes own laboratories or workshops - and they can employ scientists there to do that.  Not in universities.

I am not advocating for industry funded research to disappear, I am saying it should not happen in a university setting.  These should be places of learning and independent thought and research, not ready made labs for industry to throw cash at to profit from.  In this scenario, the scientists are still there, still researching, still able to publish results, collaborate with other scientists etc.

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"Londoner here. I was in Canary Wharf at work when they happened. 

&gt;What were you thinking at the time? 

Jesus christ, I hope x dozens of people I know are okay.

I had pleading emails from my mum saying 'will you girls please come home NOW.' My response was 1) I have to be here for my boss who's coordinating our crisis management response and 2) leaving LATER is going to be much more sensible than early (most buildings had mainly emptied by 3pm, people just didn't want their employees around and a lot of people were shellshocked and very upset). My sister was working in the City and simply wasn't allowed to leave, they'd cordoned a whole chunk of it off for safety. I think I eventually left at 6/6.30pm. 

&gt;How were you affected after? 

Momentarily. For a few days. Londoners are sadly quite used to our City being bombed, I'd grown up with it being part and parcel of working in London. I was more affected by a near-miss train crash some years earlier, that freaked me out about being on trains for almost two years (I'd be jittery and on edge the entire journey), but after a few days of getting back on public transport, I was fine. We tend to adopt a 'fuck you, we will not be beaten' attitude and in a way, that collective attitude is quite comforting. 

&gt;Did your view on muslims change after? 

No.

&gt;Were muslims in your area treated differently afterwards? 

Muslim friends reported being eyed suspiciously on many occasions for quite a few years afterwards. Unsure about in my specific area. 

&gt;When did you first hear the bombs had happend? 

Quite early. My boss was responsible for coordinating emergency backup and flow of information for his department (or the company, I forget), and we got direct police info that others didn't until hours afterwards (most landline phones were down, it was impossible to get a mobile signal). So I knew they were bombings for quite some time and had to keep quiet: flow of information in the wrong manner can make people panic. 

&gt;How well do you think the emergency services responded?

As best they could given the circumstances. [This IAMA from my friend may help answer that question better](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17dx7n/iam_paul_dadge_london_77_iconic_image_hacked_off/) as I think I asked him about this there.

* Indian (or Pakistani?) neighbours routinely cooked strong spicy foods thick with onion that penetrated my apartment as well as detectable 2 blocks away *every afternoon and evening* ensuring I couldn't open my windows to let fresh air in (because the air was thick with curry) - but worried if I complained I might be accused of racism (look, we'd know when we are playing music too loudly, right, so why don't Asians know when they are cooking too strong a meal that will annoy neighbours?)
* every time I've tried telling a black guy off for anti-social or criminal behaviour he'll start following me, or shouting at me, or threatening me - so I've learned to leave black people alone and let them get away with whatever they want, be it jumping tube gates, littering, or listening to their music far too loudly

experience. Our business specialists help 
companies link business challenges to 
underlying processes and uncover the key 
improvement levers relating to people, 
processes, organizational structures 
and technology. Accenture’s IT and 
systems integration knowledge is equally 
valuable, enabling companies to use BPM 
Automation technologies to drive agility

&gt;Accenture’s process modeling design 
and implementation capabilities enable 
companies to install, configure and 
operate a business process repository 
to store key business artifacts such as

designing, building, and testing the 
applications that will automate these 
pivotal business artifacts into an agility

process quality and consistency

If I weren't more cynical, I would be convinced that there was some kind of competition between these companies to say the least in the greatest number of paragraphs.

I can explain some: 

&gt;At the core of these services is a powerful convergence of Accenture’s management consulting and technology experience. Our business specialists help companies link business challenges to underlying processes and uncover the key improvement levers relating to people, processes, organizational structures and technology. 

Very long way to say 'we help firms become more efficient' by optimizing processes, motivating and using technology to help productivity. Also, what is unique about them is that they identify the problems (management consulting) but also implement the solution (technology) which is the 'convergence'. 

&gt;Accenture’s IT and systems integration knowledge is equally valuable, enabling companies to use BPM Automation technologies to drive agility and innovation via the implementation of optimized business processes in processcentric, model-driven applications.

Lot of rubbish here. BPM essentially means using systems like SAP to automate tasks like accounting and payrolls IIRC. 

But that second paragraph you quoted is the worst I've seen. 

I will say Accenture is probably the worst when it comes to writing these drawn out explanations that are so vague.

Perhaps if those who wished to cover their faces were required to wear registration tags (and those tags could be checked by members of the police force) I would be happier (just like cars have registration plates to record offences).

Put boiling water in first, then drop the tea bag in. It tastes astronomically different in my honest opinion. After many hours of study, apparently pouring boiling water on the tea bag in the mug scolds it. Causing the taste to change. Brew for 2 - 3 minutes as usual.

OR

Put about a table spoon of cold or lukewarm in the bottom of the mug, put the teabag in and mush it about a bit. Use a teaspoon to shield the teabag and pour boiling water in, avoid directly hitting the teabag. Leave to brew for a good 2 or 3 minutes and it tastes better too!

OR

If you're after something with a bit of a bite to it, take a teaspoon of grouse whiskey and mix it in.

And Obviously...

The Tea pot is superior, where you can get away with using it, do it. Nothing tastes better than 6 bag strong 2 hour brewed teapot tea!

More interesting info for anyone interested! Everything this great Rifleman above me says resulted in the RGJ being nicknamed the 'Black Mafia'. Because of their skirmishing and flanking role on the battlefield, riflemen were traditionally taught to be far more independent and free-thinking than their red-coated colleagues. The tradition continued throughout the various rifle-brigades who gained a reputation for almost mutinous independence.

This philosophy has now been essentially adopted by the entire army, whereby there is now a chapter in the battlefield orders called the 'Two-up'. You tell your men what their bosses' boss wants done. Even if the whole plan goes tits up, the last rifleman, armed with nothing but his *sword* (Riflemen call their bayonet a sword, because the first rifles took so bloody long to reload, that they took a sword into battle) and his massive fucking balls, can still assault the last trench and win the fight.

*MORE INFO!* You know Cadet units? Where kids 13-18 can play soldiers? [1st Cadet Battalion, The Kings Royal Rifle Corp is the only cadet unit in the UK (although I have never been able to find another cadet unit *worldwide*) to have won it's own battle honour.](http://www.krrcassociation.com/history/cadets.pdf) Lots of cadets wear the battle honour of their regiment, but 1CBn KRRC won its battle honour through the actions of its *cadets,* and as such has a battle honour that only the young cadets are allowed to wear. The instructors and adults wear the Rifles cap badge, while the cadets wear the KRRC badge. During the Boer War 1900-1902 1CBn KRRC sent ~100 boys to work as stretcher bearers. Four cadets lost their lives. A memorial to them hangs in the office of the CO of B Company 1CBn KRRC.

That is literally untrue, though. I mean, you can keep saying it if you like being wrong about things. But it's factually false.

The controller is first seen at 02:20. It's seen in the control room at 03:10. The Doctor takes it from the salvage crew at 05:50. This is also the point where the Doctor explicitly tells us that the magnatron is responsible for the damage (in case seeing it happen a couple minutes before wasn't clear enough). The burn on Clara's hand (which provides the final catalyst of the solution), is established at 7 minutes in and reappears frequently. At 14 minutes we begin experiencing echoes from the past. At 27 minutes we explicitly see that past and future are manifesting in the present, including moments explicitly happening just before and during the crisis. Shortly thereafter, we establish that they're real moments and not just projections.

None of these things ""show up right at the end of the episode"". In fact, all of the key elements that will lead to the episode's conclusion have been established within 15 minutes of the episode beginning.

&gt; Why does he use it to stop the Tardis from blowing up the second time and not the first time?

This is addressed in the episode it. The Doctor says, ""I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure this time. I'll take it in there myself.""",0,1368476523,null,0,false,0,c9y357f,t3_1e83ey,t1_c9y357f,t1_c9y0d6c,null,1431169843,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Moffat is the only good steady writer. But even HE is suffering from his own ""no two-parters"" restraint. His greatest episodes (indeed, some of the greatest in the whole shoe) are all longer than 45 minutes.

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead - brilliant two-parter
Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone - brilliant two-parter
The Eleventh Hour - brilliant, 65 minutes long

His pacing has fallen apart since he started writing stand-alones. In Series 6 it caused the character development to fall apart, as too much plot was being twisted and resolved in 45 minutes.

The Bells of St John was excellent pacing for character and dialogue (a lovely refresher to Moffat's golden days), but it sacrificed story for that (wi-fi resolution was rushed and silly).

But this desperate attempt to paint UKIP as a racist party does everyone a disservice, because it actually stops legitimate scrutinty of the policies on which they ought to be judged and found wanting. I think if we had a sensible debate about it the outcome would be a realisation that UKIP as a party have some ludicrous policies... but they have a good point about the EU, and it seems now that whatever the future holds for the UK and the EU, there will have to be a re-evaluation of its democratic legitimatcy as it has long outlived its mandate, and is one of the least democratic organisations in the world.",0,1368478254,null,0,false,0,c9y3t0c,t3_1e995f,t1_c9y3t0c,t3_1e995f,null,1431169531,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

Mikel was arguably the MOTM in both our semis against Barca last year, and in the final vs. Bayern. He did this in his defensive midfield role, in a team that won the CL based on its defense. That should be a good indicator that he has the quality to play in that position. 

Depending on what system we are playing, Mikel is often not tasked by the manager to contribute to the offense beyond recycling possession. This hurts his image with the fans, who (fair enough) do not see him contribute to the attack. However, anyone who's seen him play for Nigeria should be well aware of his ability to significantly play a part in attacking moves...the manager simply has to instruct him to do so.

Because you rent, and by extension are basically a second class citizen in the eyes of the law and society.

The UK consistently scores amongst the lowest nations for rental conditions, which is alarming considering I think its now 7 million properties that rent.

I'm convinced that in the next 5-10 years the living conditions/legal rights of private renters is going to be propelled into the 'number 1' political issue that things like the economy and Europe currently occupy... especially as large numbers of people currently &lt;30yrs start to have children and are forced to raise them in the substandard shitholes that pass for rental properties.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"One of these days I may sit down and tear the whole thing apart. But I'll start by doing some commentary on the beginning of the episode and we'll see how far I get before I can't stomach it any more.

00:00 Very nice establishing shot.

00:07 Here's where the episode begins to fall apart. You've got Newspaper Man and his wife standing in a corridor at the Sweetville factory. The guy tells her to call the cops if he hasn't come back in an a hour. This makes no sense: If that was going to be the plan, he would have left her *outside the factory*.

00:30 Gillyflower and a bunch of women immediately walk out of the elevator. The elevator moves faster than it will ever move again and the entire sequence makes no sense once you understand what's actually happening in the episode.

02:15 We get the picture of the Doctor captured from the dead brothers' eye. Let's take a moment to discuss the sequence of events here (which will be revealed later in the episode): The reporter goes into the factory area, gets pushed into the venom, has an adverse reaction, flees, reaches the Doctor's room, dies, is removed, and then dumped in a canal.

Nothing about this makes any sense: Every other human who has an adverse reaction to the venom can't move at all (and even the Doctor can only stumble around like Frankenstein's monster). But this guy is capable of running full-out? 

Given the layout of the factory as it is shown in the episode, the guy would have had to run back down the corridor where his wife and Gillyflower are standing in order to reach the Doctor's room. That doesn't appear to have happened, although we might explain this as his scream being due to something else and his exposure to the venom only happening later.

Somehow his body is retrieved from the Doctor's room without anyone becoming aware that the Doctor is being kept prisoner in there. We could hypothesize that the blind girl took charge of the whole thing, but this doesn't fit with everything else we're shown.

Finally: The Doctor's room is kept locked. So even if you want to try to explain away everything else about this sequence, it still comes down to the same thing: It doesn't make sense.

02:28 We introduce the fainting joke. This might be mildly funny, but is very poorly handled by the director/editor throughout the episode.

02:32 Despite the fact that Madame Vastra clearly saw and reacted to the contents of the eye photograph just 15 seconds earlier in the episode, we now have a sequence in which the photograph is blown up multiple times and Madame Vastra reacts *again* as if the first reaction had never taken place.

02:50 The title sequence. Mercifully, the scriptwriter is unable to exert his influence here.

03:25 These next two scenes are actually pretty good. The carriage interaction between Vastra, Strax, and Jenny is hilarious. The rally against moral decay is creepy in all the right ways.

05:55 Here we get the first of many completely pointless scenes which have been inexplicably strewn throughout the episode. It consists entirely of Vastra explaining to Strax the plan which they just explained two scenes ago and which we saw Jenny putting into effect in the last scene.

06:27 Next we have a necessary scene of exposition (the blind girl is giving food to her ""monster""). But the scene is very awkward because it is so brief and so short on content.

07:10 And here we have another entirely pointless scene. It consists of a fainting joke and then Madame Vastra repeating the exposition about the photograph that we already heard earlier in the episode.

09:11 Jenny waits to ask for a distraction until after she has already started picking the lock. (I blame the director for this. Also for having them loudly discuss the distraction while standing farther from each other than from the people nearest to them.)

10:45 Vastra, having done nothing for more than a day, suddenly thinks to herself, ""I should go investigate the bodies."" So she leaves London and heads north again. (This scene isn't great, but it's serviceable. It should have replaced the pointless one we saw at 07:10.)

11:45 It is now evening again. We see Gillyflower distract one of her loyal servants so that she can feed Mr. Sweet. This makes no sense, because none of her loyal servants appear to be surprised to discover that Mr. Sweet is suckling on her tit later in the episode.

13:00 The Doctor's hand shoots out of the food slot very fast and disappears equally quickly, despite the fact that 30 seconds later we will see that he is barely capable of movement at all.

13:45 Jenny gets alarmed because something on the other side of the door is banging loudly. She offers a deal to let it out if it stops banging loudly... and interprets it banging loudly as agreement. This makes no sense.

16:30 The Doctor is shown to be capable of retrieving his sonic screwdriver and using it. This makes no sense. He could have escaped days ago without Jenny's help.

Honestly, I think Farage is living the dream, pal.

When I was a teenager I read a book about scientology, and ever since I've always had this whimsical ambition to start my own religion. I like to have a joke about it sometimes, about how anyone can start a religion, and how L. Ron Hubbard had his own navy, houses all over the place and all these followers giving him money.

When you see Farage, he's got such an expressive face, always laughing, [a fag and a pint in his hand.](http://i.imgur.com/HESP0HW.jpg) No wonder muppets like you look up to him. I reckon he just decided one day, ""people are such idiots - they'll believe anything. I'm going to make up a political party - it's going to be a mish-mash of all the worst populist nonsense, those idiots will lap it all up"".

So here he is, 20 years later with this wildly successful joke-political-party, and he's got clowns like you defending him. He just spouts lies, that are provably wrong, and you won't question them, won't even look up the facts for yourself, just because you want to believe his nostalgic-optimistic vision.

Most of us are caught in a rental trap where we pay more in rent than we would in mortgage... which prevents us from saving for a house deposit and so are forced to continue to pay high rents for substandard properties and next to no legal protection. 

What do you think the difference between the landlord and their tenant is? The £200,000 it cost to buy the property?... no. It's the £20,000 of deposit the landlord was able to put down that the tenant didn't have.

It shouldn't be up to one human being to be able to decide that another can't keep basic household pets simply because they are a 'tenant'. At the end of the day, the tenant is already legally obligated to return the property to the landlord in the state in which the recieved it or face financial penalities. So there is no need for it to be written into contracts that they can't keep animals... its degrading.

Tenants need the legal right to do what they want within the house they pay for. Landlords need the right to persue tenants that damage their property for the full cost of repairs (beyond the damge deposit) to prevent tenants having to put down huge deposits (which further prevent them from putting down a mortgage deposit by holding large amounts of money up in deposit protection agencies).",0,1368480568,null,0,false,0,c9y4oaa,t3_1e8sjc,t1_c9y4oaa,t1_c9y4hvv,null,1431169109,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

It is with regret that Manchester City Football Club announces that Roberto Mancini has been relieved of his duties as Manchester City Manager.

This has been a difficult decision for the owner, Chairman and Board to make and it is the outcome of a planned end of season review process that  has been brought forward in light of recent speculation and out of respect for Roberto and his extensive contributions to the Football Club.
Despite everyone’s best efforts, the Club has failed to achieve any of its stated targets this year, with the exception of qualification for next season’s UEFA Champions League. 
This, combined with an identified need to develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football at the Club, has meant that the decision has been taken to find a new manager for the 2013/14 season and beyond.Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: “Roberto’s record speaks for itself and he has the respect and gratitude of Sheikh Mansour, myself and the Board for all of his hard work and commitment over the last three and a half years. He has clearly also secured the love and respect of our fans. He has done as he promised and delivered silverware and success, breaking the Club’s 35-year trophy drought and securing the title in 2012. I would like to personally and publicly thank him for his dedication to the progress that he has overseen and for his support and continued friendship.""

Assistant Manager Brian Kidd will take interim responsibility for the remaining two games of the season and the post-season tour to the United States.

I'll give you an example. Let's say you and I have dinner one day, and we hug when we say goodbye. One of my hairs gets tangled in a ring you're wearing and yanked out. You don't notice, because it's only one hair, and don't remove it. Later that evening, you are killed after struggling with an assailant in your kitchen. The only retrievable piece of foreign DNA on your body is a hair caught in your ring. My DNA is already in the database for some reason. I must have done it!

However, the receptionist at work overheard you arguing with a colleague about some money you owe him the day before. That evening, a woman walking her dog saw a man matching his description ringing your doorbell. Your neighbour heard raised voices and the sounds of a scuffle through the wall. Suddenly it's not looking good for your colleague.

If I had been the colleague you argued with, then the DNA evidence would certainly be difficult to explain in court. But all those witness statements described a tall blond man, not a short dark haired woman. Although there is no physical evidence to link him to the crime, witnesses have given him motive and placed him at the scene. They all agree, and will be cross-examined for inconsistencies in their testimony.

Things like DNA can get there in totally innocent ways; even in the case of rape, semen could be present as a result of consensual sex, or a condom could have been used anyway. Ideally, you want forensic evidence *and* witness testimonies. But if there is only one, witness testimonies are much better at building up a full picture of events than forensic evidence. Even in TV shows, they will usually interview multiple witnesses as well as collecting physical evidence.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"In 1975 the general public was asked whether or not we wanted to join a free trade area within Europe. We did, because it was clearly a good idea and massively in our own economic self interest.

The British public's view has not changed. We would very much like a free trade area in Europe which respected the traditional structure of the nation state while ensuring economic dependance upon each other, preventing war and conflict.

But that is no longer what the European project is about. Now it intends to create a single European superstate with the ability to tax, spend and dictate laws for the entirety of Europe.

There are many benefits to that, and many costs.

The fact, however, remains that this new superstructure does not have a mandate from the British people, who whenever given the option between voting for Eurosceptics and Europhiles purely on the issue of europe have voted for parties unwilling to transfer additional powers.

If we are to be a good and productive member of Europe, then we must recommit to the project. If we are to become independent, then it will be because of the people's will.

I do not understand how anyone who both believes in the principle of democracy, that legitimacy comes from the people, and who recognises that the public need not see something as a determinative issue when voting for it to be of vital importance to them and the nation can be opposed to this.

Either we will return to the heart of europe with a clear and consise mandate for integration, or we shall remove the millstone from Europe while making ourselves the masters of our fate, the captains once again of our souls.

""The DfT said that driving into a bike zone when the lights are red is an offence. It carries a £60 penalty and three points on your driving licence (maximum £1,000 fine if it goes to court). Police have some discretion over which bit of the Road Traffic Act to use, but most likely it will fall under ""Failure to comply with a traffic sign or road marking"".

So driving into a bike zone when the lights are red is illegal. Although there is apparently a great deal of confusion among the police themselves. One thing is for sure. Booking drivers for this offence is not a priority."" [(Source)](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jul/29/cycling-advance-stop-line)

4) Filtering is great!. It's safer (for bikers), eases congestion, reduces traffic volume and carbon emissions when done correctly. When done poorly it puts yourself and others at increased risk, is likely to cause an accident and thereby cause huge congestion and further pollution.

When filtering you are many times more likely to be found responsible in the event of an accident, so please do it safely and remain conscious of other road users.

I have a few questions as a future UK jobseeker. I'm an American citizen working in the Silicon Valley area as a C# developer. I have about 5 years experience in the field (3 as a developer), mostly working in .NET, but I have a couple small open source side projects written in various languages--mostly Arduino C++ and Ruby on Rails. One problem, though: I don't have a university degree. How much will that set me back when I arrive in the UK? I'll be on a spouse visa, so work clearance will not be a problem. I will be doing OU when I arrive, for whatever that's worth.

My second question: I have a resume (errr, CV) updated and ready to go. Here in the Valley, you just have to update your LinkedIn and you'll get bombarded by recruiters. I'm guessing it's different over there, though. I should have the visa mid-July, and I'll be moving early to mid August. What's the normal process for ""starting"" to look (i.e. using a Resourcer, putting my resume on Monster/Dice, or applying directly to companies), and when should I do it?

He is the main striker with Suarez out of the way and with Coutinho behind, it's easy to see why he is scoring goals when you have little other outlets to choose from. 

Chelsea midfield players have scored in the range of 80+ goals this season and our defenders have nearly 30. Our setup means we do not rely solely on a striker as we are almost playing a false 9. 

Ba started off well until Colo broke his nose and unfortunately didn't have the same Zorres effect. Having Ba cup tied hasn't helped his number of appearances either. Again our play style is not the same as what he got at Newcastle where he was *the* target man. With so much talent around he may go without from time to time.

true,hazardousplay,present,Eden Hazard,"Torres is mediocre, and only has his goal count because of how many matches he's featured in. 15 goals in 49 appearances? It's not horrible, but it's also not what the primary striker of a team like Chelsea should be producing, and not the production we need. Not to mention he doesn't really perform against top clubs-most of those goals were against lower opponents.

Ba got the lion's share of his league goals at Newcastle with their setup, and hasn't performed nearly as well here. I think he'll do better next season

Lukaku is gonna come back and kick some ass, but he still needs time to really become a world class forward (say 2-3 years if he really works at it). 

Rooney is a strong, classy striker who can also set up goals just as well as he can score them. Plus he's good at holding onto the ball, which is essential to our system; it's been one of Torres' biggest flaws. He did 12 goals with 10 assists in the league this season at United, which is comparable to Mata's stats (11 goals, 12 assists) in the league. Not bad for someone overshadowed by van Persie. I think he'd slot in very well, especially if alternating with Lukaku.

It's always worth remembering when reading about Churchill's failings as a person that he was a product of his time. There was a good reason (by the standards of politics at that time) he was not a mainstream politician. His political failures are somewhat less... kind.

For example, Churchill's time as Chancellor. He came into conflict with Keynes over his policies. I apologise for the source, and especially the colour scheme, but: [here](http://freetheplanet.net/articles/134/the-economic-consequences-of-mr-churchill).

When he returned to power in the fifties he was instrumental in overthrowing the democratic nationalist prime minister of Iran, Mossadeq, and replacing him with an absolutist monarchy overseen by a cabinet of Iranian Nazis who he'd had imprisoned during the war for trying to set up a pro-Nazi regime in Tehran, some of whom were very closely connected to the Third Reich.

Being told ""they're so scary we blew up a galaxy"" and pointing to a black spot in the sky isn't nearly as effective as seeing first hand WHY these Cybermen are so powerful they'd be forced to take such a drastic measure.

If the Doctor had taken one look at the Cybermen's new abilities, agreed with the military protocol of blowing up the planet, then raced to get everyone into the TARDIS so they could escape, that would have been one thing.  But we don't have any sense of urgency beyond those set by what's immediately in front of us: there are a lot of cybermen, and a platoon of troops with one gun that works on them.  If this had been a fully outfitted force of soldiers, grizzled veterans who are scared witless by what they're about to go up against, that would have been one thing.

But again, even the regular cybermen would have been enough to overwhelm this group of people.  The sense of threat they tried to impress upon me failed because all I saw was the Cybermen tricking idiotic and cowardly soldiers with gimmicks and getting blasted as they walked one-by-one, single file into a big courtyard.

And when they finally got inside the gate, what do they do? March in step, **slowly**, toward the cowering soldiers and Clara rather than using their new superspeed to overcome the vastly outnumbered force in seconds.

It was weak, pure and simple. It was gimmicks that had no tangible effect or result, because the forces were utterly lopsided in power and skill : /  Seeing a single Dalek go through an entire facility's coordinated, brave, and well armed security guards without taking a scratch impressed upon me how dangerous they were.  Seeing the Sontaran invasion force fighting the UNIT military showed me how outmatched humans would be in such a fight, despite how hard we try.  These were cases where we were SHOWN how big a threat the enemy was, by SEEING them take out an otherwise formidable opponent.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I feel like crying. 

I mean, I don't feel too bad for Mancini, he'll go manage another top club, and will obviously do an incredible job, because he's Bobby Manc, but he won't be ours any more. He's a legend at the club, and we sacked him. This is a bigger loss than the cup final, at least emotionally, and perhaps practically as well—only time will tell.

Having said that, I'm not too scared of becoming another Chelsea. Mancini had a good three and a half years, that's more than AVB, di Mateo, and Benitez combined at Chelsea. It's still a poor decision, and I'm absolutely gutted, but it doesn't necessarily set the precedent of ""win or leave"" that everyone seems to be thinking it does. As long as they get someone good, and don't expect miracles out of the gate. 

It's still tremendously risky though. A few good signings and the desire in the players to not repeat last year would have secured us the title at least, and who knows with the champions league. Now, who knows what to expect. Rather than a few key signings in areas we need, we could be overhauling the whole squad this summer to meet the new managers taste. That can take time—even with the funds available to him, it took three years for Mancini to overhaul Hughes' squad—and who knows how it will effect the mentality of the squad.

The players are going to have to get a new manager to contend with, and whatever else is true of Mancini's relationship with the players, he was at least a known quantity to them. They're reaction to this season could have been predicted. They came here to win trophies, there's no way they were satisfied with this season and honestly that would likely compel them next year more than any new manager will. Now we have no idea how the motivational approach to this new manager will affect they're determination next campaign.

There's also the fact that our two main rivals are also getting new managers. Stability in a time of turmoil for them would have been a godsend. I expect United to have a harder time competing next year under Moyes, and who knows what will happen at Chelsea. They could blow through another two managers by the end of next year. This could have been our chance to know what the fuck we were doing, when no one else did. 

Whoever replaces Mancini will need to be willing to pick up where he left off, build off of what he's built. Our formula is so close to perfect. We just lacked the finishing touches—flexibility and a bit more grit. With Mancini, we would have gotten even closer next season, but who knows, he's always been a domestic manager, but we've got our eye on Europe. There is the potential for even greater improvement under a new manager than they're was under Mancini, but there's also the potential for a significant step backwards. With Mancini we could at least be certain of some improvement. Hopefully we get someone who will take us in the right direction—the one we've been moving. I'm excited to see who that man will be, but also a bit scared. ",0,1368488760,null,0,1368493062,0,c9y7kd6,t3_1e9roi,t1_c9y7kd6,t3_1e9roi,null,1431167747,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

We need this more than a defensive mid-fielder. Our midfield always finds a way. Some more depth would be nice, but even with this season's insane season, we got the job done against a variety of teams and playing styles. 

What we didn't do was have a striker up front who was feared by opposition and put us 1-0 up early on a consistent basis. Or even scored consistently throughout the season. Or even just consistently threatened opposition defences, even lower level ones.

I would much rather have such a striker and loan out Lukaku until he is one of these strikers. Chelsea is a hard team to come through as a youngster. Even if we were to develop him in-house, I would still prefer us to bring in a top striker to be number one choice with Lukaku as back up. Which isn't fair on Lukaku.

Things that annoy my wife:

The wind- apparently it's always windy in Bristol, no matter the force of it. It was gusting 42mph today, on a bike that is not fun.

There's never any nice weather- she's lying. We have a mild, temperate climate. Expect rain mind!

Service in shops- you may not get the friendly experience you get in the USA.

Service in restaurants- again, service is slack compared to the US and can seem slow.

Cost of living- higher than the US, I've noticed from when I visit.

It's hilly- can't change that

Things she/I likes:

Old buildings- go look at Bristol Cathedral; it'll blow your country's short history out of the water

Food- there are some amazing eateries here and I think some of the best in the UK

Bars- see above

Cycling- this place is hilly as fuck and some cyclists are just as bad as car drivers. If you ride, ride defensively!

Entertainment- fantastic theatres and music venues

Hope this helps! I love Bristol and I'm glad I moved. It's up there with New York on the scale of ""I'd move here right now"". It's a great place and thoroughly fun ",0,1368489110,null,0,false,0,c9y7oso,t3_1ea1fd,t1_c9y7oso,t3_1ea1fd,null,1431167689,18,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,18

true,LadySkywalker,null,null,"Hey, I'm going  as a graduate this fall and I already have an Msc from another UK university as an American. You need to realize that there is very little funding for us (Americans) unless you're applying for Phd programs. Currently, and without interest, I'm -$50,000 in from just my one year masters. Fortunately Edinburgh is cheaper than my last place but you will want to travel and you will have to buy many things that others don't have to worry about (such as bedding and heavier clothing). My advice would be, apply, and then immediately go the financial website and mark down every single thing you could possibly apply for and gather everything you need ASAP. Some of those things close in October, like Fulbright, so you need to be really organized when you decide to apply. Be aware that you must have proof of finance before applying for a visa. So do not wait until the last minute if you're getting a loan. On the bright side, if you can handle it and if you need to, a tier 4 student visa lets you work 20hours a week during term and 40hours out of term. You're also allowed to stay for up to 6 months after you graduate from a masters program or 12months after a phd. 

For moving, well, you get maybe 2 suitcases if you're lucky. If you really really can't part with something, ship it cargo on a boat and wait it out. Try and land early in the morning and NOT on a Sunday. Shops actually close outside of America, and sometimes they don't even open on Sunday. Grocery shopping is the same, and if you're lucky your kitchen will have some basics, like pots and pans and a kettle. Either way, they'll be tons of shops to get student basics along with, most likely, a student discount. (Still sorting out shops myself but you get the hang of it in like 24hours). I applied for graduate student accommodation. You can take a look at their website and their facebook to get an idea of the room situations. Some are full on flats and some are dorms. Regardless, this is the UK and you will not have to share an actual room unless you want to. There will not be bedding but there will be a mattress and all the furniture you need. And while we all love a good trip to the office supply stores, hold off on big school buys until you've got at least 1 reading list under your belt. 

As for actual graduate school, I would give it a think. I like your phrasing but if you're just toying with the idea of school, you may not be prepared. It is actual school, and it is rigorous. Edinburgh is a very good university and you will not just be lounging around. The UK education system is also different from ours. Depending on the department, you may find that you are taking more or less classes than you would in America. You are also expected to be more independent in your actual learning. Yes, grad school means independence, but the education in the UK system will have you teaching yourself more than you are used to. 

Socially, I wouldn't worry too much unless you have some seriously crippling social anxiety. The first week, or the week before first week (zero week), generally has a ""freshers fair"" of some kind where you can go around and sign up for everything that looks fun and try your hand at meeting people and hobbies and the like. Edinburgh has a great sports program as well and the gym website is worth a look. I think you'll also find that departments, especially at the graduate level, are a bit less formal 24/7 than in America. Coffee meetings in the morning and wine/port/scotch to celebrate small things happens more than it does at home which is rather nice. 

Hope some of this helps. And if it counts, I proper excited to be attending!

Ba is a tricky one because I think he still has his best to give to Chelsea, but I dont think he's the striker Chelsea need right now, he's not dangerous enough if that makes sense.

should be a good signing - with the contacts he's had in the game - i'm sure we'll bring in a few big names - get more attention - the situation at rovers is really helping us too - get some ex-rovers legends (dunn apparently considered coming over this year) - we're picking up alot of digruntled fans from there too - one guy's been a season ticket holder for 20+ years but he's just appalled at the way the club is being run.

it would've been great to come down to pompey to see the stanley game - shame your so far away!

true,yourfriendkyle,num19,,"Our system is changing now, but in recent years we beat teams with the following positives:

* More concerned with attack and flair than defense. While this is not always the truth, Spurs have had an air about them for awhile that they've wanted to play exciting football before effective football. 
* Quick Transitions and Counters jumpstarted by a deep lying playmaker (Modric/Huddlestone)
* Quick natural wingers crossing into a poacher paired with a more creative finisher (Keano &amp; Berba, Vdv &amp; Defoe/Pav), or a big targetman paired with a finisher (Crouch/Ade &amp; VdV/Defoe)

In the last two seasons, with the squad improving and getting better results, a more possession based game has developed naturally as opposition teams have a greater care to not be caught out against us. That transition this season has coincided with losing our two most creative passers, which has been the reason we have relied on Gareth Bale Football Jesus to score goals, as we are otherwise usually a pretty stodgy team at the moment. 

I'm not sure exactly what AVB has in mind, though I do expect us to be playing with a pairing of a natural and an inverted winger next season. I only suspect this as it has been a standard of AVB's and Mourinho's teams for years. For this to be truly effective we will need to have left footed LW to retain the shape and width and keep the CB's honest, while Bale cuts in from RW to score goals. This will be especially good for our team since we have a very fast and talented RB who can fill the space left by our inverted RW. This is why I think that a LB that is better defensively than offensively would be a better choice than a more offensive LB.

That last reason is probably the one that makes me think that Dempsey does not fit this team. With how the talent in this team falls, we really do not need a goal scoring LW. We have a much more effective goal scoring RW in Bale, and since Dempsey will naturally float inside, it clogs up the space that Bale needs to be effective with his pace. Siggurdson is a much more effective player at LW as he is much more of a support player who can make passes and retain the ball. Dempsey scores goals. Goals are important, but we have to play as a team, and sometimes what's best for the team is creating space for players that are better than you are. Dempsey is not as effective at this as a left footed winger would be.

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt;I prefer to reserve the label ""left"" for what left was always intended to represent

Well, once upon a day, before the Labour Party even came along, it was the Liberals who were left-of-center, even though they embraced capitalism too. So an appeal to history doesn't necessarily prove much on that count. I mean, in its original meaning, being ""right-wing"" meant supporting absolutist monarchy and the pre-1789 social order of the ruling nobility, so by that standard all parties nowadays are *left-wing*.

Terms like socialism, capitalism, fascism, environmentalism, even liberalism have a substantive meaning. Each of them can and have been used to cover a wide enough range of views, but there are some basic objective criteria. Eg, taking their lowest common denominators, if you don't support public ownership of some sort or other, you're not much of a socialist; if you don't support welfare state institutions and lowering income differences, you're no social-democrat; if you don't want to take measures to protect the environment, you're no ecologist; if you don't share broadly secular values and a basic acceptance of the market economy, you're not a liberal; etc.

With progressive and conservative, it's already a lot more relative, since their meaning depends on the status quo. If you prioritize protecting values of the present or restoring those of the past, you're temperamentally conservative, whereas if you feel that the world is not enlightened enough yet and needs to evolve further, you're progressive; but what that means depends on the time you live in.

It's like that with left-wing and right-wing too; if anything, more so. Those terms just don't have an inherent, objective meaning. Their wording itself indicates that their meaning resides in how they relate to the political center of a society. If there is a temporary shift right or leftwards it's fair enough to highlight that, at the moment, it seems like everyone's right-wing - but that requires at least some realistic reference point from a not all too distant time or place. I.e. arch-conservative minds across much of Europe could, I'm sure, for some time argue that nobody but them was really right-wing anymore because everybody else had started favouring parliamentary democracy over absolute monarchism and rule by the aristocracy ... but at some point, society had just definitively changed and new meanings of what was right-wing were forged. So what relatively recent time in Britain would one have to refer to in order to call The Guardian, The Independent and the BBC, say, all just right-of-center media?",0,1368494805,null,0,1368495450,0,c9y9ptw,t3_1e4fiw,t1_c9y9ptw,t1_c9xamq0,null,1431166734,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Well, we've gained a trait of scoring late, sticking out until the end, that's been fantastic.

We've scored more goals than last season, but not enough. New striker on the cards? Let's hope he can whip in more than a certain few lads who'll not be named.

A more integrated squad. Holtby, Siggy, Moussa, Sandy, Walker, Lloris, Verts are all a year older, wiser, better, better fit in to the squad. We do have a very young squad.

In terms of conceding, I don't know. I think having Sandro out has been a huge part of that. We've conceded more than the teams around us. We've conceded 10 goals more than Arsenal, who've been fairly notorious for shoddy defending this year, strangely enough.

I, personally, don't think we're there yet. We haven't the maturity in the squad. I'd say that where the end of a season should be a final surge, we often have been caught out, whilst we tend to have silly defensive errors, 'Tottenham moments' as I call them, all too often, especially on set pieces.

true,smokey815,num11,,"I think it's a definite possibility.

We need a striker, but if we can bring in a guy who can lead the line well and get us goals, I think Ade and Defoe are suitable at 2 and 3.

With Townsend coming back, we're in decent spot with our wingers.  If we somehow manged to bring in Son or someone similar, that would be amazing.

With CM it's weird.  If we bring in another guy who can play both going forward, but also cover defensively, I think we're set there.

With Kaboul coming back, we're fine at CB, and RB is set with Walker and Naughton.  LB is my only worry, it all depends on Benny and Rose.

More than confident in our keepers.

AVB is also a huge part of this.  He's been great this year, very few times it seems he's actually made a mistake tactically that cost us, and I expect to see that continue.

Overall, I'd say our first XI is at least close to top four material.  I'd say it's there, but there are good arguments the other way.  If we can get some solid depth, I could see a season where we compete very well with three of our four real competitors bring in new managers.

Always know your fastest alternate bus routes. 

Don't forget to walk around above ground to figure out the above ground distance between stations a lot of them are extremely close to each other (i.e. Leicester Square and Covent Garden) and sometimes it is just easier to walk with certain types of delays. 

ALWAYS look at the number of stairs a station has before deciding to skip the lift. 

Take up as little space as possible while on the tube, it makes everything easier for everyone.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Well, once upon a day, before the Labour Party even came along, it was the Liberals who were left-of-center, even though they embraced capitalism too. So an appeal to history doesn't necessarily prove much on that count. I mean, in its original meaning, being ""right-wing"" meant supporting absolutist monarchy and the pre-1789 social order of the ruling nobility, so by that standard all parties nowadays are left-wing.

I'd dispute that somewhat.  Left and right arise from the enlightenment and French revolution, they specifically refer to the seating arrangements in the then parliament, and - philosophically - to whether (as you say) one was in favour of monarchy _and hierarchy_ or against hierarchy.  The French revolution pretty much dealt with absolute monarchy and delivered a form of capitalism, which was intended to lead to more egalitarian less hierarchical social arrangements but has been less than a stunning success in this regard.

&gt;if you don't support public ownership of some sort or other, you're not much of a socialist; if you don't support welfare state institutions and lowering income differences, you're no social-democrat; if you don't want to take measures to protect the environment, you're no ecologist; if you don't share broadly secular values and a basic acceptance of the market economy, you're not a liberal; etc.

Agree with this pretty much.  What gets my back up is really when people conflate socialism with Statism, saying stuff like socialists worship the State or want the State to own everything.  This is a complete misreading of what socialism is about (worker ownership of the means of production). It's okay to refer to this as ""public ownership"" because collective ownership via a democratic State is one possibility (not one I would support as an anarchist) but to call it State ownership is to be too narrow and fails to see how State ownership by an un-democratic State is just another form of capitalism (State capitalism, as in China or the former USSR).

&gt;So what relatively recent time in Britain would one have to refer to in order to call The Guardian, The Independent and the BBC, say, all just right-of-center media?

David Tennant was always a fun, jolly Doctor, until, suddenly he EXPLODES with seriousness and emotion. Which, hey, it was awesome. I loved it.

Now Matt Smith! The way he can say something, or even whisper it, and it'll be just as powerful. Recently, as the OP is pointing out, he's gotten louder and bigger in his speeches.

He is putting on cloths, talking to the Atraxi, asking them to look at earths records and who he is...not shouting, just saying, hey, look....and then he closes it off with ""Basically....run"" And that does it, it invokes all the fear and furry of a timelord with so little breath.

Or is he just gambling here? Wanting to be back to the club where the club and the fans love him? Or has Abramovic sort of apologized?

I just want to know what is the possible deal or conversation these two would have had? Because after what happened the last time; I never thought Mourinho could come back and work under Abramovic.

true,notmentat,UnionFlag,London - Kawasaki ER-6n,"Hmm, I'm more worried about your school's answer than anything - they absolutely are allowed to teach you to filter, and they bloody well should have too - you're allowed to filter on your test.

I understand that officially you shouldn't over take the first car in a line if you're filtering - ie, not filter to the front of the lights as that's actually over taking, or something, but I'm not sure that is really an issue.

To add my tuppence to the others (and more or less giving the same answers...).

1: No, those boxes are for push bikes. Yes, most bikes will use them in order to get away when the lights change.

2: Yep, always between rows of cars, not cars and barriers.

3: There's no right or wrong answer really. In general try to filter back into the traffic - in my (admittedly only fairly short) experience, most people will give a bit of a gap for a bike as they know you'll probably be gone ten seconds later. There's always one or two that won't, of course. The trick is to be always doing a speed at which you can safely stop filtering in time if you need to.

4: Take it easy and take it slow. I didn't really filter much at all for the first few months - I just stuck in traffic. Until I was more comfortable with all the other things I had to think about. It was only recently that I realised I'd started filtering without really thinking about it. Just be prepared for the idiot who takes offence at you filtering and moves to block you.

Businesses make decisions about who to work with everyday, for all sorts of issues. If you don't want to work with a person, because of their sexuality or race or whatever, you could usually quite easily get out of it by claiming some other issue.

You'd be surprised how often if you're filtering through stationary traffic in a town, people will cross the road without looking. Bikes are pretty uncommon compared to cars but pedestrians will often think that if the cars are stopped there will be no other traffic. When you filter to the end of a queue, want to pull in and there isn't quite enough space, it quite often pays to stop to the side of a car and turn your head to give the driver a nod. In my experience car drivers don't mind you pulling in front of them, a number of gopro videos on youtube notwithstanding. Making eye contact when riding is helpful when riding in general too.

I also read in an advanced riding techniques book that you shouldn't pull out to filter unless you have a place in mind to pull back in.

A landlord could reasonably challenge any of the rights granted to the tenants by the AST on the basis that they were forced to sign the contract.

What you're talking of is the contract principle of duress. There are two main factors which determine the existence of duress, laid out in Enimont Overseas v Rojugotanker Zadar [1991]. These are (1) that the threat is illegitimate  (usually meaning unlawful but also pertaining to civil wrongdoings in tort or contract law) and (2) that there is a lack of a reasonable alternative to agreeing for the person threatened.

I think it's pretty clear that legislation in this case would be legitimate as in the eyes of the law there is no body more legitimate than Parliament. Furthermore, even if this requirement didn't exist it would be unlikely for the courts to  deem a contract voidable due to potential legislation like this as it would be assumed this would have been thoroughly considered by Parliament and Government and is thus an area of public policy.

Another option is, of course, Henderson and Suarez alternating in AM and Gerrard/Allen competing for the holding midfielder role but, judging by the reports, we are in the market for another AM.

I agree completely that it is the landlord's property and his right to do what he wishes with it. However, one of the most basic tenants of freedom is that they only extend to the point where it does not impede another person's more basic freedom.

In this case, the landlord has a basic human right to use his property. However, the gay tenants have a basic human right to be free from discrimination. In this case, the landlord is not actually affected in any way by his tenants being gay, except to be offended by it in his mind. However, refusing the tenants for being gay has a very real effect on the physical well-being of the tenants because they now have no where to live!

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think we are very close to being able to compete for a title but still need to make some additions to make the jump from CL contender to title contender.

As everyone has said, we need a striker.  Truthfully i think we could use 2 strikers (Bony/Benteke/VanWolfswinkle/PEA/Remy/Damiao/etc) that could rotate with either Ade/Defoe (i would vote JD).  We need goals and getting a single top striker really isn't enough and neither JD or Ade are true top of the league strikers (not sure any of the players we are constantly rumored with are either to be fair).  

Having seen teams just sit the entire team behind the ball completely shut us down because we struggle to create in the middle it wouldn't hurt to have a true creative force in the CM slot.  Mouts would fit this but i don't think we will pony up the cash they will ask.  Strootman is fantastic but seems like a young more talented version of THudd in that he is a big, physical CM who can really pass but (at least from what i have seen) you wouldn't put him on a list of quick agile CMs. Would love Erickson but seems like Dortmund are already speaking with him.  Would be a tough fill but i think a true deadly goal threat up top we could stumble our way through without a true creator in the CM slot.

Even with Townsend coming back we could really use some depth on the wings. A hamstring injury to Townsend/Lennon/Bale puts us in a shit position on the wings. Both Siggy and Dempsey can cover on the wing but neither are natural wingers, neither have the pace of a natural winger (especially if we move to AVB's 4-3-3), neither are true threats to breakdown a defender 1x1. Dempsey has a habit of drifting way inside and narrowing the attack, Siggy's ability to fire at the goal gets a bit wasted when we ask him to stay outside and hit crosses.  Son, Tello, Capel would all be nice cover and would allow us to move Bale around as well.

Benny/Rose at LB concerns me.  Benny was rough all season long, Rose looked fantastic at Sunderland. But neither looked a defensive force at LB which we could really use.  Maybe a preseason with AVB will get Rose to settle and defend better to go with his ability to move forward.

Really what it comes down to is we need more goals to start and a bit more quality depth all around mixed with just more experience by the guys we have in house already.",0,1368525374,null,0,false,0,c9yh1eu,t3_1ea9np,t1_c9yh1eu,t3_1ea9np,null,1431163213,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

They don't have a right to live in his house, no. However, the house is being offered up for rental as a product/service. Like any other product or service, it should be against the law to choose who you provide the product or service to **based on sexuality**.

If the landlord provided a different, valid reason, like they had pets, or a bad reference, or insufficient financial backing, then it would be fine. But refusing them based on their sexuality is as bad as refusing them based on their race because it is something that is out of their control and therefore cannot be blamed for.

The number one reason flying is safe is thanks to human flight crew, and their support structure (mechanics, engineers who built the aircraft and systems, ATC etc). 

While it's true that the leading cause of aviation accidents is crew error (which is misleading and I'll get to that later), many, many *more* accidents are avoided due to pilot's actions. It's impossible to quantify every potential accident that is avoided due to pilots, because they happen every day and are the result of judgement decisions and intuition displayed by the crew that a computer couldn't manage.

But even in demonstrable incidents - a time where an unforeseen incident occurred, the crew responded to it properly and saved the aircraft/occupants, the lives saved by pilot actions far outweighs those killed. The entire industry is very aware of how important pilots are to flight safety, which is why they still exist - manufacturers would not build aircraft with two pilots, regulators would not mandate passenger aircraft have pilots, insurers would not mandate it, and airlines would not keep buying them if pilots were more of a safety risk than a benefit.

true,blueb0g,eng-durham,Durham,"Oh dear. Bought into simple media portrayals a little too much, have we? Don't be so confident on something you know literally nothing about.

Pilots are *the* reason modern aviation is safe. Whether they are using the aircraft's tools to help them fly (whether that's a weather radar or an autopilot), *they* are the ones flying. Your use of the world ""automation"" betrays, again, that you don't know what you're talking about - there is no true automation in an airliner. Everything is controlled by the crew. The crew give it instructions and it carries it out. An autopilot is all fine and dandy, but without a competent crew to operate it, it will do nothing, and with someone who doesn't know what they're doing operating it, it will crash.

Think of it like a surgeon in a modern operating room. We are seeing the growing use of surgeons using robotics to assist in surgeries. Does this make the surgeons job any less important..? No! Without the doctor, nothing would happen, but the robotics reduce the workload and increase accuracy.

Automation allows pilots to do a lot that they would otherwise find it hard to do, as it can be very accurate. But it has not (and will never) replace the human crew. Also it must be noted that every single takeoff and 99% of all landings are done manually (auto-landings have actually existed since 1965).

So, your assertion that pilots are there only for ""back up"" is wrong, as they are required to operate and fly the aircraft. But at the same time, you are right, that a sort of back up is a major reason why pilots are so important.

Pilots are, as has often been noted, both the first and last line of defence against an accident. As such, they serve a vital role both in the operation of the aircraft (the first line of defence, ie not fucking up) and a backup against something going wrong and crashing the aircraft. As I wrote to the other commenter, there have been far more lives saved by pilots acting in ways in which a computer could not (UA 232, US 1549, BA 38, QF 32 and many, many more) than have been killed by pilot action.

The key difference however is that, for Westminster we don't vote on specific, we vote on a broad spectrum of the leanings of those involved. 

People didn't vote labour exclusively because they would introduce the min wage, they did so it made a statement that they would look after the interests of the lowest paid above their employers. 

People didn't vote Tory because they promised to cut spending, they felt at the time the economy needed to be prioritised, and they seemed most likely to do so.

Finally, if we leave Europe, how easy do you think it will be to get back in? How do you think the EU would sit with us being in and out every 5 years because we changed our mind?

The decisions made in Westminster are often, to some extent, reversible. We introduced tuition fees, if people think in 5 years that was a mistake, it would be relatively easy to reverse. Same with digital economy act, detention without trial.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Do you think a person rejected from a job application based on their race should have recourse to sue the employer for racial discrimination? Do you believe it should be left purely to market forces?

In a truly competitive market, where everyone, producers and consumers share the same information, then it might be reasonable to rely on consumers to boycott immoral companies.

However, even a cursory glance at the economy today will tell you that this almost never happens. This is because of two factors: lack of information and lack of alternatives - perfect information and unlimited alternatives being two factors absolutely necessary for a free market to work as expected.

An example of this is the market for petrol. The suppliers are an oligopoly and we cannot travel without petrol. So no matter how many people know how much we are being abused as consumers by oil exporting countries, we still have to buy it from them.

In the case of this rental, the rental market is really a sellers' market now. As a tenant myself, every year I have to find a new place and the price goes up (relative to inflation) and the quality keeps going down because landlords know that the demand is always greater than supply. Thus, we have a lack of alternatives for the homosexual couple.

Secondly, homosexuals are a minority group, which means they are obviously incapable of forming an effective boycott by themselves. They would have to rely on the public to help them. While most people would probably agree that discrimination against sexuality is wrong, it is unreasonable to expect that all these people will feel so strongly about it that they would forgo renting the property if the price is right because it is difficult to find a good place for a good price. Here, a lack of alternatives makes it almost impossible to form an effective boycott.

Finally, not everyone looking for a rental place in that area will have read the news about this case. Not to mention that the news article does not inform the reader about who or where the offending landlord/house is. So even if every potential tenant felt strongly enough about discrimination against sexual orientation to boycott the property no matter the price, no one knows which property they are supposed to boycott! Thus, a lack of information makes boycotting the offender impossible.

When something like this happens, where the minority doesn't hold the power to protect themselves, and the general public don't have the information and/or the will to protect the minority, the last recourse is for the government, acting on behalf of the apathetic public, to step in and create legal protection for the minority.

Lots of Labour voters want a vote to leave the EU, but view it as being less important than the economy, so they vote for a party which does to reflect their views on one important issue. The Tories are the same, they want to appeal to the centre so ignore the democratic wishes of their party members.

There is a clear majority in favour of a referendum, but those people care more about the economy, wages and health, so vote for pro-eu parties.

This is why things like party finance, gay marriage and the like have such problems getting implemented, because while the majority of the public sipport them it is unlikely to,determine whether your vote changes, incentivising politicians to go after minority factions who will vote on it.
