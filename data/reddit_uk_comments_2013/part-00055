support for other game modes (reverse draft, deathmatch when its out, etc)

bot should display stats calls in PM/notice to keep the channel tidier.

depending on wether or not the API can support this, but give the bot the game ID (or host a second, stats bot, whatever) and allow it to determine basics stats from said records like picks for example, so we could draw tables on which heroes are banned/picked the most, average game lengths, who's had the longest/shortest games etc.

a bot feature that triggers when dave hits the 700 bracket and automatically calls the samaritans suicide hotline.

true,[deleted],null,null,"By people like me, do you mean people who think it's clearly illegal and immoral for the press to run rampant and buy footage from people who do nothing but hound people day and night, irrespective of celebrity? The press as it is now, ruins the lives of many people that in quite a few cases have turned out *not* to be paedophiles or any other kind of sex offender; they've dredged up the hurt feelings and memories of families *just like* the Dowler family in the pursuit of the ""freedom the press"" and people ""having a right to know the truth"".

The truth is that out current press industry is cancerous, and *real* journalism is all but on life support; thanks to rags like the sun and the daily mail, people think that ""Journalism"" is reporting the whereabouts and lifestyle of every non celebrity out there, and a rolling publicity machine for the Cowell empire. The current press system has *too much* control over our political system, and in the name of journalism, have done things that we wouldn't accept from our security services - yet apparently, we're quite alright with some idiot with the cash to pay the right people doing in the pursuit of sating our own curiosity. It's wrong. It's more than wrong, it's bloody immoral, and I honestly find it hard to believe that people have actually down voted me for using the naughty child analogy when *clearly* these idiots with press passes lack the basic humanity and moral code (which they've traded in for more ambition, by the way) to recognise that they're doing and have done something wrong!

I'm not suggesting for a moment that we should censor the press. I'm suggesting that our press should be something *we* can be proud of, and those dirty, bent politicians in Parliament should *fear* once more. We need a code of practice because apparently, people like newscorp don't seem to know that it isn't ok to hack a dead girl's phone and bring hope to a family that is simply trying to get past their grief and get on with life, or shoulder responsibility for the death of people *like* Diana by buying paparazzi footage, instead opting for the easier route of feeding the paranoid delusions of Mohamed al Fayed. We should be *ashamed* of ourselves for buying a paper that spread so many lies that hurt so many people about Hillsborough, that *most* of the city of Liverpool won't buy the rag! They don't mind though - they don't care...They still get their lies, and their bile bought elsewhere in the country, and rewarded for their tenacity and ambition.

Journalism and free press is a beautiful thing. It's a sacred thing, and I genuinely do believe that; Journalism when it is about presenting the facts can be every bit as damning as a barrister, and can affect *real change* in society, but what we have is *not* a press to be proud of. And so they need the naughty step so the people who genuinely love their jobs, check their facts and have a real passion for reporting the important things instead of being a glorified gossip columnist can be allowed to grow and succeed in their field.",0,1363949513,null,0,false,0,c90ckfj,t3_1aqo4q,t1_c90ckfj,t1_c90bq1e,null,1431667216,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,KarmaUK,null,null,"What the majority of people should be asking is why we need to push people to look for work so hard in the first place? Yes, it's all very nice to make it feel like they're 'earning' their paltry £71.  

IF half of them did nothing, it'll only mean those who are wanting to return to work will get jobs easier, and employers won't be flooded with applications from people who don't even want the job, but are just ticking boxes.

I've recently had to sign on again, and we have to be willing to travel 90 minutes each way to work, for minimum wage, I don't drive, that's going to be a sizable chunk of my income, and also, with so many unemployed, do they think there won't be 100 people already applying from nearer?

I do feel like a lot of what 'jobseekers' need to do is mainly to appease those who don't want them to get the money in the first place.

While the unemployed so vastly outnumber the available jobs, it really isn't necessary to push them so hard.

Also, it's just another layer of stress upon them, forever living in fear that you'll suddenly be left with nothing because of an admin error, or some minor misunderstanding of the rules.

for instance, I asked if I really had to 'visit 5 employers a week' and he said 'oh no, don't worry about that so long as you do 15 activities a week, that's fine.'  I still feel like if they wanted to, they can claim I didn't actually visit employers, and therefore I've broken my written agreement.

I do a ton of jobseeking online and in the papers, but I don't see me getting taken on by just wandering into offices and asking, I feel a good cover letter and a CV to HR a bit more professional.

Also, what's with all the silly rules about education, training, volunteering etc? Surely if people want to improve themselves under their own steam, to make themselves more employable, that's a good thing?  If they can prove they're still looking for work, that should be enough, we don't need some limit plucked out of thin air.

EDIT: Obviously in a time where there's low unemployment, and many jobs to be had, we should push people a bit more, but it seems either a waste of time, or just picking on the poor to do it now.",0,1363951460,null,0,false,0,c90csc4,t3_1armb0,t1_c90csc4,t3_1armb0,null,1431667303,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,moonflower,null,Barmaid,"1. There's one subreddit which I make a particular point of posting in every day that I visit reddit, ever since it began last summer: there is a Counting To Infinity project happening in /r/counting and I like to participate ... it's basically counting, one by one, comment by comment, and we are up to the 43,000's now and it's surprisingly good fun for certain types of people, especially the sudden scramble to be the one to get the big round numbers 

2. I pick up interesting and quirky little bits of info all over the place, but I suppose /r/todayilearned would be the place to go looking for it ... perhaps the most surprising place to learn things is /r/WTF where interesting and rare medical conditions are often talked about in the comments, including by medical professionals who can give detailed info

3. I am currently a mod for this pubreddit, hurrah! and also /r/counting and also /r/equalityissues which is now abandoned ... I used to be a mod in various other subreddits and left for various reasons

4. A couple of people very kindly bought me reddit gold recently, and I find the most useful feature of it is that when I return to a discussion page, it highlights the new comments which have been posted since my last visit to that page ... that is *very* useful to me when I am following a huge discussion

5. About two and a half years ... I used to read reddit occasionally for about 6 months prior to joining, and as soon as I registered an account and started commenting and voting, I was immediately hooked

6. I visit /r/SubredditDrama because I enjoy watching internet drama, and also enjoy participating, so yes I've seen some gloriously entertaining fights, and particiapted in many too ... my all time favourite massive drama was the meltdown of /r/LGBT when the mods suddenly decided to purge the subreddit of all dissent and make it a ''safe space'' for approved opinions ... there was uproar for weeks and it would take weeks if anyone wanted to read the whole drama ... it's probably not as much fun to read it a year later as it was to read it while it was happening, [but here's a link to the first of a 3-part recap](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/qjn8w/recap_the_tale_of_rlgbt_part_i/)  
My favourite fight in which I participated was ['moonflower versus The Gender Pronoun Police'](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/qzp37/moonflower_rmuser_and_silentagony_debate_rumusers/) which was fukkin hilarious (I linked to the SRD discussion about the fight because that was also fun; the actual fight is the link at the top of that page)

7. Apart from reddit, I suppose the next time-wasting thing I enjoy on the internet is playing little browser games, like escape the room games and strategy puzzles ... basically point-and-click fun

8. Before coming to reddit, I spent most of my internet time in 'spiritual' chat rooms, and encountered many people with far out beliefs, such as people who communicate telepathically with aliens, and people who are reincarnated high priestesses from Atlantis, and astral travellers, and witches ... the internet is an amazing opportunity to talk to people who you might not meet in real life ... I always went to small internet communities, so coming to reddit was like moving from a small village to a vast city, and I felt a bit lost at first, but it feels like home now

The other two depends on what they say really.

Or to be more precise, how much of a benefit rolls in. I mean, much of the IMF saying that there was too much austerity was due to the fact that projecting multipliers is really tough and they got it wrong. If we went the other way and overestimated multipliers then it's a massive hole in future finances. 

Further, the problem is that in extending borrowing now, yields demanded will inevitably rise (they have been for us since about last June anyway). Debt interest repayment is already the third (?) largest source of government expenditure, so it could really start to crowd out future consumption or investment spending if borrowing were to become more costly.

I mean I absolutely wouldn't want to walk down the road and see signs like this, racist slogans, or even most Daily Mail headlines for that matter. But it is all very well to ban this and that, until it is something you care about that gets banned for being ""offensive.""    

For example, the guy who got arrested for holding a ""scientology is a cult"" sign. That was deemed by the police to be offensive so he was arrested under section 5 of the POA. I mean the court threw it out, which is good, but my point was about consistency in the law.

""But the claimant can't cook!"", I hear you say. Great.  
Train scores of unemployed to work as cooking and health tutors.  
If you want your benefits, you go to lessons.

Reignite the northern textile industries and have them supply welfare clothing.  
Use high profile designers, like they've done with Jamie Oliver for school dinners, so that there's not *too* much stigma, but having taxpayer money end up in the pockets of corporations that pay people with small hands a pittance to make clothes in a sweatshop that thugs shoot each other over is *not* a solution to providing ethical clothing to those in need.  
You used to be able to see perfectly fine with NHS glasses, and they're even back in fashion.

Restrict free NHS to those who have been here two years on a permanent residency permit.  
Create a subsidised government health insurance plan for those who wish to use the NHS, but are still working towards their two year mark, like those on work permits or pursuing residency.  
This way the poorer immigrants won't be marginalised, but there's no free ride either.

Dorms, not houses for teen mothers.  
Use these locations to provide healthcare, further education and child nursery support so that these women can be protected from abuse, gain worthy education and work skills and get the time to get out for work and socialise.  
This will free up many council properties, eject slacker dads who won't partner properly with the girl to avoid losing the free housing (yes, I know people that do this personally, not just on Daily Mail articles) and encourage women to further themselves in environments that do not currently do so.  

I'll admit some of these might seem a little right-wing to some, but some closer monitoring is required.

1. We offloaded Balotelli this season

4. Suarez has said he would consider offers from bigger teams

Then read my opening post, about how he is a proven striker, etc etc.

This has nothing to do with, ""duhh hey that player is good, lets buy them"" it comes down to the situation we are in and the statements he has made. Aside from the controversy and the hatred some people have for Suarez the pros he has (potentially over Cavani and Falcao), he is younger, a proven EPL player and probably wouldn't be sold for 60mil, which the price already put on Falcao/Cavani (IIRC).

It is similar to if Silva were to leave and Mata came out and said that he would like to play somewhere else in the EPL, perfect replacement and he'd probably fit well into the team, a la Suarez.

If Debenhams explicitly say the contract is finalised on dispatch, then you agreed to those terms when you used their site. Until the dispatch point, both the consumer and the supplier are free to back out of the deal. Once the item has been dispatched, then the contract is finalised and they'd be legally required to sell for that price.

Essentially, when you order online, you offer to buy an item for £X. The shop is only considered to have accepted your offer when it dispatches the item (providing it says so on its T&amp;Cs). In this case, Debenhams will reject all the offers and, almost certainly, refund the money.

Also, the only reason they can do this is that it's a buyer's market. Farmers can't just switch from dairy to poultry or strawberries, so they'll struggle on until the bank forces them to stop.

Theoretically, once enough dairy farmers have been forced out of business, demand will exceed supply and prices will rise - unless the supermarkets can find another cheap supplier aboad, or by making the process even more industrial.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"Not sure if you guys followed the Chelsea trying to buy Luke Shaw saga. He said he wasn't interested, signed a new deal with Southampton and plans to be there for a couple of seasons. The reasoning behind this is that in case he has a dip in form at the age of 18-19-20, Southampton won't just dump him out of the squad, something that Chelsea would do and write him off as a ""failed acquisition"". He therefore, will not think about joining a big club just yet. He wants to get the right game time, develop as a player and develop his game. That way, he gets to move to a club that won't write him off too soon, and Southampton get a big fee for him (15m isn't unrealistic given how he's progressing).

As for Spurs, I agree. BAE has had a big dip in form. He's become slower, and he's had enough game time to get back to his game. He's constantly out of position and unlike Walker doesn't have the ability to sprint 30m in 2-3 seconds to recover. We need a cover for him, and Naughton isn't an option. Danny Rose coming back into the squad from loan would be good enough, I don't see why people don't mention him more. He's quick, got a great foot, has become defensively solid with Sunderland and would be good to have back. Won't cost us anything and I'd rather NOT have Levy paying ANY money for a left back or any other position before.... drumroll....

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;I didn't say it would be easy, but isn't that what we pay the government and hmrc to figure out?

Not really, they don't have a remotely good track record.  It's an incredibly complex issue, which in such a simple hypothetical has no simple solution. The point I was trying to make is I very much doubt anyone can come up with a suitable suggestion for fixing it.

What it really comes down to is that corperation tax, is really silly.  

Another example? It would hurt our UK economy to not allow shipments of AnimusBrand mobile phones in.  They are the market leader in fancy phones.  They create a whole industry of mobile orientated applications, every big company must have a website that works on it and an app etc.  This innovation helps generate more sales in our economy whilst connecting customers in a more convient fashion.  Efficency has created a better living standard for us.

But this phone was made in China, Japan and Korea.  Designed in Korea, why should any profits be taxed in the UK?

So we have to have VAT or similar tax on purchases of the phone.

Now say I wanted to make such a device in the UK, its immediately a worse value prop.  Why would I?  I'd have to have a damned fine reason too given the costs.

This is why a high level of corperation tax actually drives away businesses being based here, which in term harms job creation.  However consumption of it is efficently and effectively taxed at point of sale via VAT.

If you tried to tax the cups as they were imported, I'd just import them via the brand new Irish subsidury, which is then in the eurozone, so free trade within.

Corperation tax is a tricky one, without it, foreign investors profit more from UK business.  Oh wait, thats great!  We want that.

Erm without corperation tax, a company that makes £100k profit and has one shareholder, would mean that shareholder keeps all £77k after their personal tax.    That's not fair.  If only we could have one unified income tax for all earnings, that would be super fair.

We've lost all those properties from the councils, who were obliged to [practice rent control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_control) and who could allocate them to the most needy (meaning everyone else would have to wait a few years for a council house). Instead people have to rent from private landlords, who are making profit for doing nothing.

There are those here who would take offence at my implication that landlords are fundamentally parasitic in nature and I admit that owing a second home isn't so bad when it's substitute for a pension, and you've worked hard to earn that equity. However there are increasingly few of us who will be able to afford even that kind of retirement provision, and at present the property-owning demographic is contracting (i.e. property is increasingly becoming an asset of the wealthy).

The council house sell-off was a massive redistribution of wealth from the public sector to the private - all these people who suddenly had a house worth more money than they'd ever imagined before, that helped fuel the 80's economic boom. Many of them blew their money and ended up now renting again! Others managed to wrangle this equity into second-homes, from which they're now earning income, an opportunity unavailable to the current generation.

Today's private renters don't have the security that council tenants used to have. Because council properties aren't available to ordinary working folks - as they were in the 60s and 70s - private landlords don't have to compete with the lower rents that the councils charged, so they can get away with charging more. The idea that you could lose your home and your dog just because your landlord felt like restructuring his investment portfolio - that really wasn't part of the public consciousness 2 or 3 decades ago, but now it happens [all](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/17l45y/can_you_help_me_rehome_my_cat/) the [time](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/16i2y9/my_friends_landlord_wants_to_evict_her_for_having/).

I could talk about this for hours - the thing is that you can't just put this in cash terms. Thatcher changed our entire society's *attitude* to social housing, too. 

Back in the day, *one third* of the population lived in council housing [[cite](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs)], and there was none of the attitude that we see today, about how society is ""supporting"" council tenants or that only the disabled ""deserve"" a council home. Having a council house was just something that was normal - for office and factory workers, for teachers and policemen - and you'd put your name on the waiting list and move in within a few years.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is where the whole ""immigrants getting council houses"" thing comes from, because 25 years ago, when I was a teenager, you were practically  entitled to a council house - any Tom, Dick or Harry could get one. Since Thatcher's sell-off this has become impossible, so obviously people look for someone to blame, and I'm sure many are unaware of how deeply they've been betrayed by their own politicians.

No, I suggested that gay people have a disorder of the libido from both a biological and a Christian perspective. I know it's upsetting and that's kind of the point. Christian beliefs made homosexuality immoral, treating the disease moral, while nowadays it's neither a disease nor immoral in the eyes of society.

However, the ""it's a disease"" and ""it's immoral"" are intertwined together in people's minds so we can't rationally separate them and discuss the issue.

Are you saying that it's the government's job to build houses for poor people to buy? Because that's what you're arguing for - you're practically advocating a soviet-style housing programme. 

Thatcher believed that the government has no place building homes - that's the job of Wimpey and Barrett, and that local councils had no place competing with them.

So when she passes the act which sold off all the council stock she ring-fenced that money and *prohibited* councils from using it to build more properties. 

Had she not done so, councils would have just ended up effectively competing with commercial developers, as they would have been constantly building homes to replace those that were privatised to their new tenants. 

Subsequently, by the mid-90s, councils were funding housing associations, whose properties were protected from right-to-buy because they were no longer owned by the council. But this was too little, too late, because councils' own stocks had already been totally demolished. 

Right-to-buy was the Enclosures Acts of the 20th century - it resulted in a massive redistribution of assets, and most nobody realised what a robbery this was until the bandits were clean away.",0,1363962997,null,0,false,0,c90eyy1,t3_1anggz,t1_c90eyy1,t1_c8z35gh,null,1431668331,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Great - finally someone to explain the economics of the issue.

We are told that farmers lose money when producing milk. So why are farmers still producing it - and in such vast quantities?

Based on what we are being told by dairy farmers about how much money they are losing, and the usual limit on the overdraft - all milk producers went bust a decade ago. Didn't they?

Or is there some hidden income from -- maybe the sale of calves and beef -- that is not being included in the calculations?

While it's necessary to ensure people can free express themselves, if that is to the detriment and damages the well being of more people than necessary, then that free speech is not more important than the well being of others.

This is an important point. Freedom of expression is important, but I think over time people have forgotten why it is valuable and therefore defend the idea of *absolute* freedom to express anything even if it is without any possible value.

I don't believe that a meaningful freedom of expression is equivalent to ""I can say whatever I want in any context without any consequences"". A lot of speech is empty and ignorant and that sort of speech doesn't have value, certainly not on the side of a bus.

What's more, when you protect expressions of hatred or intolerance over the rights of people not to be oppressed (and this is what you do if you allow people to be publicly homophobic through established advertising channels: you push gay people out of public life) that's wildly inconsistent, because one of the key reasons we need freedom of expression is so that people can speak up *against* the oppression of marginalised groups.",0,1363963287,null,0,false,0,c90f1v7,t3_1askpy,t1_c90f1v7,t1_c90dcv8,null,1431668373,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"For anyone interested, the full judgment is here: [Core Issues Trust v Transport for London](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2013/651.html).

The Court found (summary at the end);

* The Mayor didn't abuse his power (he wasn't really involved);
* TfL had an unfair decision-making process, its decision was inconsistent (with earlier decisions allowing the Stonewall and British Humanist adverts) and breached its own procedures.
* However, the interference with Human Rights was proportionate  as it protected the rights of others (gay people, in particular);
* Running the advert would itself have been illegal under the Equality Act, which gives TfL (and other public bodies) the aim of eliminating discrimination, harassment and victimisation etc. on the grounds of sexuality (something the Stonewall advert *supported* bt this one went against.

So TfL came to the right decision, but in the wrong way, and for the wrong reasons (caring more about publicity than the underlying laws).

The judge also noted that the Trust (bringing the challenge) couldn't argue certain rights as it was a corporation, and had no sexuality, and no right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. She also noted that ""ex-gays"" aren't protected under the Equality Act as being ""ex-gay"" isn't a kind of sexuality (the law refers to homo- hetero- and bi-sexual people, and covers current sexual preferences, not changing ones).

She was also fairly critical of the decision to allow the earlier adverts (Stonewall's ""Some people are gay - get over it"" one and the BHA's ""There is probably no God"" one) as they would also cause offence. But that was beyond the scope of the case, which only concerned the Trust's advert.

A key quote is this one, which sums up the proportionality argument against running the advert;

&gt; [TfL must] protect the ""rights of others"" who might be adversely affected e.g. gays who would be offended or upset by it; or who might be prejudiced by the promotion of an anti-gay message.

I'm not defending what Richard Littlejohn wrote, but this isn't like a case of phone hacking, he was just writing an opinion piece on some news. He did not demand people harass her and send her death threats.

This is not a case of inciting hatred, and bigotry isn't a crime. What would you have done? Have him fired? Imprisoned? Hanged?

When I said it was printed politely, I meant he phrased it as an opinion piece, not as a personal attack or rallying call for bigots everywhere to harass her to suicide.

It reminds me of the Australian DJ/Nurse thing fiasco. They played a practical joke on an unfortunate nurse, a little immature, but not evil.

I don't think the Daily Mail or Richard Littlejohn should continue in print, but calling for his head is the kind of reactionary crap and fingerpointing I can't stand to see in today's media. Someone always has to be to blame.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; on the other hand seems like an inconsistent ruling ala this. That offended a lot of people but yet wasn't banned. 

It was inconsistent, and the judge said as much. She found that TfL hadn't followed its own procedures and had been unfair to the Trust running this new advert. She was also critical of their decision *to* allow that earlier advert.

However, she wasn't in a position to rule on the earlier decision, and a major difference was that TfL was under a duty to help ""eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation"" in relation to gay people. Which this advert obviously goes against.

&gt; Plus since when did people in this country have a right never to be offended by anything?

There are some laws about being offended. There shouldn't be. As to why there should be protection in this case, a key bit of the judgment is [this paragraph](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2013/651.html);

&gt; TfL's aim was to protect the ""rights of others"" who might be adversely affected e.g. gays who would be offended or upset by it; or who might be prejudiced by the promotion of an anti-gay message. Advertising which promotes anti-gay views may interfere with the right to respect for the private and family life of gays, contrary to Article 8(1) [of the European Convention on Human Rights]. As a public body, subject to the equality duty, TfL was under a positive obligation to protect the rights of gays. In my judgment, this was a legitimate aim under Article 10(2).

It was also relevant that a corporation (the Trust) was running this advert, and corporations don't have sexualities, or rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Plus being ""ex-gay"" isn't protected under the anti-discrimination legislation, as that isn't a ""sexuality"" as defined.

I'm also a bit unhappy about this reasoning - the Equality Act one I'm fine with (that they should be promoting equal treatment, rather than discrimination) but not the offence one. The judge suggested that had she had to rule on it, she might have ruled against Stonewall's ""pro-gay"" advert and the BHA's ""probably no god"" one.

In fact, he explicitly said that ""I don't think it should be censored [..] They have the right to publish it"" and ""their right"" to ""publish this shit .. shouldn't be infringed"". So the way you center your whole argument on how he supposedly wants laws to ban this stuff seems like a rather elaborate straw man.

So what does ""complaints, uproar, dissent"" mean in practice? Well, I suppose you could have just asked him instead of jumping to conclusions, but ""complaints"" seems pretty straightforward. And uproar and dissent just means that decent people should voice the fact that they disagree with this filth, and do so openly and loudly. Write letters, write comments and blogs, spread the news of what Littlejohn's did, demonstrate, put signs up before the Mail's offices, whatever. 

Dissent is a long and proud tradition, in Britain as well. If anything, someone who is wary of laws to stifle offensive speech should embrace uproar and dissent as alternative response. I mean, what do you do when the BNP marches? Some will want to ban it; others will just want to hold a counterprotest. If you are against bans and regulations as approach, you should be happy that people would instead express their dissatisfaction in their own counterprotests - that is the freedom of speech way.

But the rest of your comment suggests to me that you're not interested in the freedom of speech angle per se at all. It's not that you want a world in which the Littlejohns and those calling the Littlejohns out have equal rights to speak out and have their voice heard as loudly as they please, whether it be in the Mail (for those who have corporate access) or in the street or on blogs and comment boards (for those that don't). It's that you want the Littlejohns to have the right to speak their filth *and not face any protest* about it, because protesting against it would be ""intolerant,"" since protesters would be ""demanding that their opinions be shared"". In the BNP analogy, your argument would come down to saying that the BNP doesn't just have the right to march, but has the right to march without facing any counter-protest.

Basically, you seem to interpret protests against what someone says as the suppression of that person's freedom of speech. But freedom of speech isn't about being able to speak your mind with the guarantee of not having to face any backlash about it. It only guarantees your right to speak your mind. If you say stupid offensive things, people are still going to have the right to be in an uproar about it, write complaints and express their dissent - and as long as they don't break the law in the way they go about it, you're still just going to have to deal with it.

So when it comes down to a proportionality argument, that might be just enough to make the difference.

Supermarkets don't just threaten farmers. They harm butchers, bakers, clothes retailers, grocers, and all sorts of community small businesses. Countless small retailers have been put out of business because people prefer cheap, convenient products by underpaid labour, to those produced locally.

Freedom of speech has had an interesting history in the UK - we've never really had it (under the traditional definition), but more recently have adopted the broader, but weaker ""freedom of expression.""

Excessive political correctness isn't really a thing. But some people seem to like using the suggestion that it exists as an excuse for being rude.

Minority rights are crucial in a free, democratic society. Actually, they tend to be called ""Human Rights"" in the UK and protect everyone, but minorities (although we're all in some kind of minority) are more at risk, so usually end up being the ones in court.

Hate crimes are far more complicated. Ideally it would be left as a matter for sentencing (when it comes to motivation etc.), rather than any specific crimes being needed - and I think that's mostly the way it works.

And this:

&gt;""I call it the “honeymoon period”.  When a player goes from the U21s to the first team squad, everything is brilliant, even if the player isn’t playing any minutes.  The challenge for the young player is what happens the honeymoon is over and everything becomes “normal”, Steven Gerrard becomes normal ...

And let's keep this in mind:

* Fabio Borini, 21-years-old
* Suso, 19
* Daniel Sturridge, 23
* Joe Allen, 23
* Coutinho, 20
* Jonjo, 21
* Raheem Sterling, 18
* Martin Kelly, 22
* Andre Wisdom, 19
* Jordan Henderson, 22

Now I realize some of the aforementioned players are not products of our academy but it's important to note how *young* many of our players are.

Remember the ""18-21 age bracket is the hardest to get through."" That's a lot of growing pains for Sterling, Wisdom, Suso, Jonjo. And a number of players have *just* turned 22 or 23. There's still room to grow there.

Ultimately, it's that dreaded word of ""potential."" We have loads of it and hopefully we'll start seeing results from that potential within a few seasons.

But in the meantime, I do hope that FSG understands that it will be a few seasons before all this potential is fully realized so that means we need to buy a number of proven, experienced, veteran talent that can help successfully bridge the gap between now and the future so we can win *now* AND win in the future.

In this way you internalize those rules, they become instinctual, and that frees up space to think about novel ways of applying them, or of inconsistencies requiring new rules.

The same for learning calculus for applying it to other topics, there are shortcut methods that you learn, as well as somewhat mysterious methods/algorithms for resolving particular problems. You internalize them through repetition. Once you are comfortable using calculus as a tool, you deploy it to understand electrodynamics, or you apply it in order to resolve the equations of fluid dynamics for the device that you're trying to build, or whatever.

You can say the same about learning languages, and the gap between understanding grammatical rules and actually being able to use them to speak to someone at normal speed.

And do you think it works?

Because earlier, it seems, you were saying that cockpissetc was wrong to deny that capitalism is the only system that worked because ""Show me one country where communism has worked"" - as if there's no other option than capitalism and communism. But now you yourself are identifying an example of a model that's not really either one or the other.

As for social-democracy not being an option outside of Scandinavia, as you wrote elsewhere, because it would only work in countries with ""relatively low populations and great deal of natural resources"" - what about Germany? It's not as social-democratic as Sweden, but a lot more so than Britain: more regulation, less inequality, more of a social welfare net. I mean, socialism it's not, of course, but they're far from just ""capitalism"" too.

Perhaps I'm misreading this sort of thing wrong - [it's the Guardian, but one example](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/14/insulting-section-5-public-order-act).

Now this thing means we have to define what insulting language is. And then we'd have to have courts decide if an individual _meant_ something insulting when saying something i.e. get inside their head.

That's awfully getting there for ""thought crimes"" in my book.

I'll add I'm all for charging people with verbal and physical assault when appropriate - I just don't subscribe to having the state become the arbiter of what is good or bad speech. Shouting something aggressively / getting in someone's face regardless of content is still verbal assault in my book.

Wanna give me the potential negatives of teaching kids about transgendered people at a young age instead of waiting till theyre set into the idea that youre either one thing or another?

EDIT: Gender roles suck and need to be stamped out, and the only way to do that is to start teaching kids that when it comes to acting like a boy or a girl, whether you have ""the correct genitalia"" doesnt matter a jot.

Kids are not capable of comprehending this stuff, true. But they will literally just go ""Oh, ok"" and carry on with their lives. The prejudices required to be hateful of people for differences are surprisingly unformed at primary school age. I grew up while in contact with a lot of disabled people, and I talked to them exactly as I talked to all other adults (I was a precocious little shit). At that age my mind was not going ""Eh, disabled, better talk slow and loud"" like so many people seem to do with disabled people. If you grow up thinking something is normal it's only when you're an adult (like I am now) that you realise that, ok, I grew up in a slightly unusual situation but that was perfectly fine back then so it's still perfectly fine.

I'd argue that the best thing possible would be for kids to be exposed to as much variety in the human spectrum as possible. The kids won't notice or care about the differences while they're kids, but in 10-20-30 years time they might come up against a similar situation and go ""Oh...

Young people can't afford to buy a place to live and are getting fucked over with high rent prices by the older generations and rich foreigners who benefitted from cheap property prices. Not these shitty pokey housing estates built in the middle of nowhere either. Decent, affordable homes in sensible places.

 - Transport links. I live near London and commute to work in central. My trains are -always - overcrowded and/or late and over priced. The tube is the same, worse. Busses are too slow because the roads are too congested. Driving is ridiculously expensive, and good luck parking. The only real sensible option is cycling, but I live a bit too far to be doing that. Plus cycling infrastructure is terrible and you risk your life with busses and cabs. Commuting is by far the worst part of my life. It is absolutely hateful and probably puts a lot of people off of commuting.

 - Promoting health in modern life. I sit at my desk 9-5. Go home and sit down for another few hours. Governments should be encouraging its population to be healthy. Make council gyms cheaper, reduce tax on healthy foods. Making cycling safer and more accessible. Honestly it makes such a huge difference to your happiness when you feel fit and healthy.

 - Rewrite the laws  and make them simple and understandable. Seriously how the fuck are people allowed to get away with so much tax avoidance? There needs to be no clauses. You earn x amount, you pay y, or you go to prison. No legal loop holes, no technicalities. Scrap all the bullshit laws we have now and make them understandable for fuck sake.

 - Fix the job center. I was unemployed for 9 months after uni. I went to the job center actually expecting some sort of advice and help.

Recruiters in the private sector are actually useful (albeit ruthless at times). But they do their job. The job center is a waste of resources right now and has the potential to be SO useful.

The UK is a haven for people wanting to sue for defamation. It comes down to the fact that the burden of truth is actually up to the defendant. In other words, if you get taken to court for libel then it is up to you to prove that what you said *isn't* defamation - rather than the complainant proving that what was said *is* defamation. 

In other words, if you went around saying that Richard Littlejohn is terrible at his job and is directly responsible for her death then you alone would have to find the proof linking his story to her death. And by that I mean finding a note in which she says it - nothing circumstantial; regardless of its potency. Richard would have to do nothing but turn up to court with his lawyer. Most defamation cases are settled out of court due to the ease for the complainant to win. This is the Justification Defense. 

There are other defenses, namely: Fair Comment (discussing a matter of fact as a comment - and not calling anything a statement.) I.e. ""It is my opinion that Richard Littlejohn is a callous bastard who is terrible at his job. I honestly believe that he caused her death"". It's based on real facts and it's clearly an opinion. However, if I were to say: ""I believe Richard Littlejohn is a pedophile"" then it wouldn't be valid under fair comment because there is no current news or real events to substantiate it.

There are also defamation laws covering Parliament and Government meetings which basically say anything in official records is privileged, and therefore exempt from libel (as long as you're a journalist).

In your previous comment you talked about RTB enabling people to own their own homes, and talk like this was inherently and so obviously a good thing (""I can't see why you'd think [otherwise]""). But most council tenants were perfectly happy and secure as such.

Thatcher's rationale was that, of course, in a capitalist society everyone should want to own their own home - and, of course, this is cheaper over the long term than paying rent.

But this depends upon everyone being the perfect rational consumer, which only exists in the A-level economics classroom and which is a far cry from the average labourer, who has an IQ below 100 and who left school at 15.

So owning one's own home is cheaper in the long term, as long as you don't get seduced by a slick financial services salesman who offers you a £30,000 partial remortgage on the property and it seems like ""free money"" because ""you'd be paying rent or a mortgage anyway"". So a remortgaged home ""owner"" who is financially illiterate and who blew £30,000 on holidays and a new car is far worse off, and far less secure, than he was as a council tenant. 

Now Thatcher would say that it's not our responsibility to nanny people who might make poor decisions, but I just don't see the need for the sell-off in the first place (unless it was to buy the tory party a bunch of new voters). 

The stock of council houses had been build up after WWII as a response to the shortages caused by bombings and returning soldiers and [post-war immigration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_1922#Post-war_immigration_.281945.E2.80.931983.29) - immediately following the war, government involvement in housing was *necessary*. 

I can see the case for no further building of council housing as Thatcher came to power, and I could even see the case for a controlled release of some of the stock into private ownership, but there was a decade or so there where it was like a flippin' gold-rush, and I see no need for it.

These council tenants had all the benefits of their own home - they were really very secure, you never got kicked out of a council house without a very good reason - but none of the responsibilities. Maybe it should be cheaper to own your own home, but council house tenants were paying a controlled rent to the local council, so if it was costing them more, it wasn't by very much, and they were also paying it to the body who fund libraries and meals on wheels, so they weren't losing out in aggregate.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"The BBC linked to the judgement which, if you really want to understand the decision, you should read (at least from paragraph 119). Here's some of the important bits:

&gt;The restrictions are consistent in character with the 
restrictions in the Ofcom and CAP Codes (although they are more comprehensive). 
On my interpretation, the aim of the Policy is that advertising on TfL premises, trains 
and buses should be neutral, uncontroversial and avoid causing offence to the London 
public. 

...

&gt;The decision was made 
too hastily, without hearing the advertisers’ point of view, and without careful 
consideration of the argument that Christian groups should be permitted to advertise 
in the same way as Stonewall and the British Humanist Association

...

&gt;In my judgment, the restriction in TfL’s Advertising Policy on advertisements which 
are “likely to cause widespread or serious offence” or which “relate to matters of 
public controversy or sensitivity” is necessary in order to meet the legitimate aims 
identified under [Article 10(2)](http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art10). In reaching this conclusion, I accord due weight to the 
judgment of TfL, as an experienced operator in the field.

...

&gt;The location of the proposed advertisement is highly significant. I consider that 
advertising on the side of London buses is extremely intrusive...Unlike posters, these advertisements do not remain in one place, and so 
cannot be avoided by a detour. Parents cannot protect their children from an 
inappropriate message. Although the courts have emphasised the intrusive nature of 
television and radio, at least the television and radio can be switched off. Not so with 
advertisements on buses

...

&gt;TfL’s decision-making process was procedurally unfair, in breach of its own procedures, and demonstrated a failure to consider the relevant issues...The fact that TfL had applied its Advertising Policy inconsistently and partially was 
outweighed by the countervailing factors against allowing the advertisement to run, 
namely: 

&gt;a) advertisements on the side of London buses are highly intrusive
 
&gt;b) the advertisement would cause grave offence

&gt;c) it was perceived as homophobic

&gt;d) it was not a contribution to a reasoned debate

&gt;e) leaflets, articles, meetings and the internet all provide an alternative vehicle 
for the expression of the Trust’s message

&gt;f) under the Equality Act 2010, TfL was under a duty to eliminate discrimination...Displaying the advertisement would have been in 
breach of that duty


...

&gt;There was no breach of Article 14 ECHR (the right not to be discriminated against) 
and the Trust was not protected under the Equality Act 2010....Article 9 ECHR (freedom to manifest religious beliefs) was not engaged...For the reasons given above, TfL’s decision could not be characterised as irrational.

I dredged all this up a few months ago after somebody else starting citing his work - sorry I don't have the will to do it all again.

Yeah the fact that alcohol is a big problem is not a good argument for making more drugs legal.

Not sure how you got from me not wanting to subsidise someone else's worthless job to me holding a grudge, but if you need the hyperbole to make your point then go ahead.

&gt;Have you ever been outside of the city? Maybe had a look at farms?

No I've never left the city and never seen a farm. Grow up. Yeah those £200,000 harvesters lined up, tens of thousands worth of livestock, beautiful countryside house with all the mod-cons and the 4 brand new Jeep's they drive around in, poor guys must be slumming it.

&gt;Being capital rich does not mean that you can just sell up and move on.

Why not? It's a seller's market right now, you can get at least what it's worth and usually more depending on the circumstances. Are you saying you can't start a new life with hundreds of thousands of pounds in the bank?

&gt;Let's flip this on its head: why should you be entitled to super cheap, and ultra-convenient supermarket products

I'm not entitled to anything, if we stopped subsidising farmers then good farmers would swim and bad farmers would sink, the market would expand and the forces would compete with each other for business. It's not like food prices aren't going up already anyway.

&gt;at the cost of other peoples' way of life?

Are you serious? Dang I've always wanted to go into Blacksmithing, how much of a subsidy can I get for that?

&gt;Countless small retailers have been put out of business because people prefer cheap, convenient products

No shit, who would've thought that people would gravitate towards decent quality, cheap, convenient and reliable sources of the things you list. Cost of living is through the roof atm, if you took the average family and forced them to buy exclusively from the independent businesses of old they'd be bankrupt within 6 months.

It simply cannot be true that every producer produces milk at a loss.  If a particular producer is losing money at a given price -- they should say ""no"".  That results in lower supply and hence higher prices.  If your competitor says ""yes"", well them's the breaks.

I suspect it's more likely that the marginal profit is negative, but the farm itself is profitable to run because of subsidies per acre.  In that case, it's the subsidies that are distorting the market, not the supermarkets.

Want to beat the supermarkets?  Innovate.  I am always amazed at the corner shops that say ""we can't compete with the supermarket prices"".  What are you doing competing on price then?  There are three ways to compete: quicker, better, cheaper.  In the context of corner shops: get some staff that aren't surly, rude, ignorant buggers.  Learn my name.  Say hello to me if you see me on the street.  Before my local corner shop owner sold up, after five visits he started (genuinely, not fake niceness) saying ""hello, old friend"", when I came in.  That is worth actually money to people.  You can charge what you like for beans if you make your customers smile.

From Thatchers view point and one I would agree with, that it is desirable for people to own their own home since it gives them more buy in to their community. Also it is a way for people who do desire to acquire wealth and aids with social mobility.

Aside from your condescending opinion of labourers it helped those at the bottom get a leg up. Several redditors have commented on how it helped them or thier parents and personally speaking I know a few people it helped. No one was forced to buy it was simply an option to do so. 

The reason why people should have been able to buy them is because for many they were home. They didn't want to move simply own the home they'd spent so long in. I have a family member in this position, she has no interest in moving but has lived in the same social housing for over 50 years now.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; It's a touchy subject and I tried to summarise it in two words, where there could be thousands. As I've said if you take a glance at Richard Moon's Journal on hate in Canada I linked, he tackles both sides on line drawing on hatred better than I ever could. However, it isn't really 'mine'. There are some ways of tackling speech that I think are probably best, i.e for example we don't need Nazi marches/ideology in our society, based on the context/history we have evidence to suggest how that speech ends up. Basically we need to be as specific and explicit to every case possible so that the scales are not tipped and free speech at large is not chilled. On the other hand if we do nothing, human dignity is at stake.

I read through Moon's summary which I agree does a good job of representing the various arguments and tensions surrounding hate speech. I don't want to imply that I don't think the prohibitionists don't have a point, but there seems to be a general move to protect people from emotional upset that while well meaning shows liberals at their most authoritarian. I don't think humans have a right not to be upset, and I don't think it's the government's responsibility to safeguard your self-esteem, nor pander to your sensibilities. I also don't trust the government to accurately predict ""how that speech ends up"", nor do I think they should engage in mediating the war of ideas.

&gt; It's a hard case and I said it wasn't exactly the most explicit or dangerous speech and that the penalty needs to be in light of that. Furthermore, it isn't bizarre at all that incitement can be seen as a crime. Although with critical thought, we humans could be seen to be free, humans are inherently a product of their surroundings. Liberal ideology asserts that education is key to combating negative speech and I agree but that just isn't the case right now and something needs to be done about it. Hate speech is a very loud voice in the public arena and often catches people, especially in economic and educational depravity unawares. Furthermore extreme voices can often drown out arguably more reasonable voices. If we do nothing, things can get bad. Incitement leads to action, whether it be harassment or murder or otherwise and the people shouldn't just be unaccountable. This especially applies to the media who have an obligation to society, because of their inherent influence.

The problem we have here is just who is deciding what constitutes ""negative speech"". At the moment it is the liberal establishment. The fact that I agree with them that racism is both immoral and illogical does not alter my contention that they have no right to dictate the state of play on the battlefield of ideas, which is pretty much what they are doing. Of course what people say has an effect on how others behave - there would be scant point in saying anything otherwise. But your line of reasoning diminishes the responsibility of those who actually commit violence and discrimination, passing off onto a person who has merely spoken in favour of these things. It also implies that it is not incumbent upon an individual to analyse the information they receive, a proposition that runs counter to any concept of personal responsibility.

This topic has also been touched on in a lot of threads, but it really depends on who the new manager is and what system they're going to want to play. If they're looking for a true 4-3-3, we *might* be able to get away with our current lineup plus Ake/Chalobah/McEachran/Essien/Romeu.

If West Ham or similar don't move in to take the ongoing costs the taxpayer pays those AND the costs above, wembley for instance costs around £10mil a year in running costs.

Do you think children find it stressful when they find out one of their friends has two mums? Or do they just go ""Oh, okay"" and get back to their Lego?

Nobody is saying you should sit down with children and explain the emotional and social implications of being trans to children. That would likely be quite difficult for them. But knowing that sometimes ladies prefer to be men and vice versa is only a difficult concept because of the social stigma we have created in our culture. Kids don't need to know about the cultural nuances at that age; tell them its a thing that sometimes happens and they'll accept it.

I personally knew several trans people growing up. My reaction to learning about their status was much the same as when I learned my babysitter was gay. I didn't give a shit. I assumed that everyone was the same until I got older and realised that some people considered trans people as something weird or terrible. I didn't understand.

Oh really? so do you believe as a child if they feel more comfortable as a girl you would support a gender re-assignment surgery, what exactly is the age in which a child can make an informed decision about its future and presence of genitals.

People like you wish to promote themselves as so tolerant and understanding and ""it makes no difference to me"", yet seem to not understand how impressionable a young child is.

Gender is not a social construct whatever the soft sciences would like to claim, just research evolutionary psychology.

Thinking children at any young age should be exposed to the complications of a tiny minority of individuals is to miss the point entirely.

Transgender is unusual and is not a clear cut choice in the same way as a haircut or a sexual preference, once you commit you cannot undo, and this may come as a shock but many transgendered actually regret the change they did, and wish to go back.

Again using this as a platform to tell everyone how ""liberal"" you are is to miss the point. transgender by definition is abnormal

5. A couple years, I've had many different accounts before but I like it here and so I'll stick with this one mostly these days. :)

6. Nah, not any particularly decent popcorn comes to mind with reddit.

7. I'm really shit at internetting elsewhere these days, I read a couple gaming sites and a few blogs. Usually I'm just redditing though.

8. Used to use a fair few different forums, usually musicy,telly-based or whatnot. Occasionally pop in to a couple now and then.

I assume Josh has a future at Chelsea along with De Bruyne as well.  I see Oscar or KDB taking the Lampard role, which means what we really need is a player like Mikel, but with more offensive skills.  

That role is exactly what Sami Khedira plays for Germany and for Madrid.  I know everybody has a massive boner for Modric, but he's not the answer. He's much too small and we already have players with massive talent along his skill set.

The concept of a musical episode's much more popular in America, but seeing how much Doctor Who's recently been taking notes from American television I doubt it would be difficult to cross the gap.

For highly-regarded science fiction see [Voyager](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Virtuoso_\(episode\)) and [Fringe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Betty_\(Fringe\)). For science fiction in general see [Lexx](http://lexx.wikia.com/wiki/Brigadoom) and [Sanctuary](http://sanctuary.wikia.com/wiki/Fugue). For fantasy, see Xena: Warrior Princess (pick [either](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bitter_Suite) [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyre,_Lyre,_Hearts_on_Fire)) and, of course, [Buffy the Vampire Slayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_More,_with_Feeling_\(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer\)).

I hope this was informative.

**EDIT**: And for comedy (which Doctor Who is, quite a bit) you can look at [Community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Holiday_Music), [Scrubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Musical), etc. etc.

£100 borrowed for 12 months at the maximum amount chargeable  (26.8% APR) will cost £15.20. Usually no penalties for repaying early either, in fact, most encourage it. They like to get members into the idea of saving.

Savings are usually based on a percentage of any profits made on the loans. For some unions, these can 0%. Others can be quite small. Some, however, can be substantial, it varies. Some are now moving to more traditional interest-paying accounts to tempt customers through their doors.

Additionally, if you scroll down to the savings section, and are fortunate enough to live / work in some parts of the country, or have a certain profession, you can get market-leading ISA rates (3-4%).

**ESSENTIAL EDIT:** 

&gt; Credit union savings have exactly the same protection as normal savings accounts; in other words, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme will pay back £85,000 per person, per institution. In any case, many credit unions limit the total you can save with them to £10,000.

Humans, though I guess the question could equally apply to any other species for which you claim homosexuality is a disorder.

&gt;preventing them from reproducing

Homosexuality doesn't prevent anyone from reproducing, it doesn't make them sterile - it simply makes them *less likely* to reproduce.

&gt;Group selection isn't widely accepted by evolutionary biologists, using it to explain something with the primary purpose of making people feel better is shaky ground at best.

Ah, see here you're shifting the burden of the argument. I haven't made a positive claim that homosexuality *is* beneficial to our species (or any others for that matter), I'm taking issue with your claim that it's a medical disorder. You seem to be fairly confident in that assessment and for that confidence to be justified you really need to rule out other possibilities. There is a possibility that homosexuality could be beneficial to a species, one would need to rule that out before claiming it's a medical disorder, otherwise you're just speculating. 

There's nothing wrong with entertaining the idea that homosexuality is a medical disorder, but your implication that it's a sure thing and claiming counter arguments are simply motivated by trying to make people feel better is ridiculous.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; condescending opinion of labourers

It's not a condescending opinion to recognise that some people are poor at managing money. Obviously not all people who are bad fall into the same stereotype demographic, but some do.

I recognise that acuity is not a product of class, but education probably helps when it comes to some financial instruments. Likewise, if you're looking for advice about managing your investments (""don't remortgage and blow all your money on something stupid"") it helps if you have friends and family who have experience with owning property (or whatever).

So sorry if I phrased that badly but it's true that a great number of people who exercised RTB were those who had no experience dealing with large sums of money. They basically had tens of thousands of pounds in equity plonked in their laps. 

I'm really not convinced that RTB *did* help people up - or if so, it has done so at the expense of the following generation. A huge public asset was transferred into private hands. 

I empathise with your point that one should be able to own the home one has spent decades in, but I rather feel it's an emotive debating point - the tenant who had lived 50 years in her council house had such solid tenants rights, was at no risk of eviction and so had no real need to buy. No worthwhile goal was served, therefore. It is only due to the council house sell-off that we now have such a shortage of properties that council tenants' rights have since been eroded (c.f. the bedroom tax). Likewise, sense of community was fostered by the fact that one would be allocated a council property on the estate on which one grew up - or one could continue bunking it in mum's spare bedroom until a closer property came up.

The people you speak of that have got a leg up - well, we can take /u/Hammyman as an example. He rents out at least 2 or 3 houses to tenants, at least one of them is an ex-council property. He has stated in this subreddit that he's basically operating as middle-man or buffer - the tenant is paying off the BTL mortgage to the bank and Hammy has talked in terms of assuming c £100k of risk. So basically, Hammyman's kids won't get a council house, because he's bought them all up to act as investments. That's alright, because Hammyman's astute investment means he can help his kids up the property ladder. But Hammyman's brother or cousin, who also grew up in a council house alongside Hammyman, he wasn't so financially astute, so his kids are fucked. We can all do anecdotes, but we can see the tory party perpetuating the politics of generational wealth inequality.

I could go on and on, really. I appreciate you generally approaching this discussion in a positive and constructive manner, and I'd love to talk this through with you over beer, because I think I might just be able to win you over, which I'm not going to be able to do here. This Act was fundamentally about making housing a ""free market"", and about not (as a general rule) having council houses any more.

You showed in an earlier comment that you didn't realise that Thatcher drafted the legislation *specifically* to prevent councils reinvesting the proceeds of RTB into new properties, and then backtracked and said ""oh, later governments should have rescinded that bit"". But it was too late by then - by 1987 1,000,000 council homes had already been sold (with the money all spent and gone). 

This isn't about someone who's lived 50 years in a property having the right to buy it (I find the GLC already had a general sales scheme), but the discounts of 33% - 50% Thatcher offered turned it into a Sierra Nevada fire sale. I mean, I looked up gold rush on wikipedia, and it says ""typically marked by …  a 'free for all' in income mobility, in which any single individual might become abundantly wealthy almost instantly"" - that's it right there! That's how it was! If you were around in the late 80s and into the 90s, you'll remember people making tens and tens of thousands on their properties.

That nice little council block of flats on Ladbroke Grove - I wonder how much matey made in the end, after he did a council house exchange with an OAP, so she could live nearer her kids in West Acton. For every person that made out like a bandit, someone else ended up coming up short. Someone else ended up paying off a mortgage on that property, and not only that, but *we the people* lost out, too. It was our children we robbed, in order to give these folks ""a step up"". We added a few folks to the middle class for a decade or two, but that's been eroded now, with widening wealth inequality again. But now the public is without this huge national asset which we sold off, homes for our poor and needy.

One final thing: the costs and benefits of the right-to-buy are measurable, if we're brave and determined enough. This conversation so far has been basically waving political philosophies at each other, and seeing which one sticks. But we could go around, knocking on doors, taking anonymous surveys, finding people who used to live in council houses, people who live in council houses now, people who bought council hoses and people who own council houses now. We can probably measure income and wealth and find out whether council house tenants are now better off or worse off, on average. We can determine which demographic benefitted most from RTB.

Firstly, this wasn't a situation where two people got intimate consensually and there was a problem when the expectations or understandings on which that consent was based were disrupted. That happens, it's forgivable and rarely illegal. No person should be expected to have sex because the other person felt 'led on' or because they felt like they should just give in because the other person was insistent. This was a prolonged and very deliberate course of deception and in the moral consideration of most people, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation, that's deeply immoral. I challenge you to find a feminist who would defend such conduct by a straight man; anyway, it's definitely not cool, not for cis or trans or straight or gay people.

Secondly, I was referring to consent. Rape through violence is not the same thing as rape through deception, but there is long term damage in both instances and the case mentioned by another commenter of the police who infiltrated activists groups is a parallel in terms of consent.

You told me my ideals are foolish, but not *why* they are foolish.  That gives the impression that you don't know why.  You don't know what they are either, you're just saying i'm a communist based on no evidence.  Like that's even a thing to be threatened by, this isn't the cold war.

I was not ""throwing it out the window"" I was just expressing that it had no *inherent* value.  The value of free speech is assigned and relative, hence why it is not a globally upheld concept.  The only reason *you* value it so much is because of where/how *you* live.

Some people have had different upbringings to you where free speech has resulted in harm being caused to them, such as the recent Lucy Meadows case.  It is natural for those people to potentially hold a negative value to speech being employed in this manner.  I daresay if people had freedom to victimise you regularly, you'd want someone to stop it.  If not, others would.

In any case, we do not hold the same value on free speech here as we do in the United States, and we have laws surrounding speech used to incite hate (which further demonstrates my point about assigned value).  Within the homosexual community, the suggestion that you can ""pray the gay away"" is quite offensive, for more detail as to why maybe ask one (just try to be tactful please).  Having such ideas broadcast on busses in public may not just *offend*, it can create an extremely negative atmosphere, potentially causing some gay men  to feel victimised and discriminated against.  Some might say it's comparable to having an advertisement saying that you can pray the black away.

I understand that an issue could be raised, but only in regards to her not having the help she needs/didn't seek help in regards to her struggles with her gender identity, but your comparison to foot-size is ridiculous.   

It's obtaining sex through deception which is the crime, and posing as a male to sleep with females and using a strap-on in a dark bedroom to carry out the crime, is a lot different than ""Sorry, I lied about my shoe size.""  

They just aren't comparable. The victims will most likely be facing, or are facing, emotional and psychological damage, whether it be shame, guilt or embarrassment.  

It is a crime to obtain sex with someone using deception, or ""fraud"". I would even go as far as to call it a form of manipulative rape.  


It might not be clear-cut as that, but it's certainly a lot more than ""Aww, but she was confused about her gender!""

Yes, she needed/needs help with her gender identity issues, but that shouldn't be a scapegoat. What she did was wrong.

Not at all, it would be the feeling of utter ""I have been tricked"". You're borderline implying that the victims are transphobic, which is a hugely skewed - and dangerous - opinion on the matter.   

If a straight man was blindfolded and was told ""You will now receive a blow-job from a woman"", received it, had the blindfold taken off him and found out that this woman was actually a gay man, and the guy flipped shit, would that make him homophobic or a bigot? Fuck no.

Disproven, Quote from the article:

&gt;But that was outweighed by factors against allowing the ad, **including** that it would ""cause grave offence"" to those who were gay **and was perceived as homophobic, ""thus increasing the risk of prejudice and homophobic attacks"", said the judge.**

So a bit more then.

&gt;going off on a random tangent which had nothing to do with the case.

Quote from you:

&gt;Everything you have you owe to people like that and until you move to Communist China your thoughts about a free society are meaningless, you're just one of Anjem Choudary's acolytes and you're done.

This had nothing to do with the case.  Although my ""tangent"" was related, as it was on the nature of free speech, which is related to this article.  You going on about me being a communist and making personal attacks wasn't related at all, it appears you were being more tangential.

&gt;The precedent therefore is that if you can prove that an advert or sign offends any group of people it can (and should) be banned.

Your opinion, your interpretation.  It appears to me that the precedent being set is not to have adverts that actively victimise another group.  Pro gay adverts are simply pro gay, they aren't anti-christian.  However, if the adverts were anti-christian then it would also be fair to ban those as well.  To be honest, I don't feel busses are a suitable platform for speech that negatively targets other demographics.

&gt;It has nothing do with gay people, 

Yes it does, gay people are mentioned numerous times in the article.

It's strange that you accuse me of not having read the article when you have chosen to selectively omit parts of it on numerous occasions.

You also haven't been able to demonstrate the inherent value of free speech.  Allow room for nuances, why does speech have to be a zero sum game?  Do you feel the freedom to antagonise certain groups is inherently more value than the freedom not to be antagonised?  We aren't free to physically attack people, why should we be free to attack people in other ways?  Surely it's better to foster goodwill between communities?

What then happened was a tragic accident of bullying gone too far,  but without intent to cause serious harm (on the evidence in the eyes of the prosecution, or they would have gone for murder not manslaughter). If he was a minor then involuntary manslaughter sentencing tends to be especially lenient.

I still think the sentencing is probably too lenient, but this person is an arse hole idiot not a murderer.

On that front, I thoroughly believe the councils fucked themselves over by selling off all their council houses back in the eighties and early nineties. Now instead of getting rent payments from council tennants, they're having to pay landlords as much as £1600 (in parts of London for a three-bedroomed flat, for instance) in the form of housing benefits. If they simply owned the property in the first place and charged, say, even as little as £400 a month rent, they'd be £24,000 better off in a year for _just one property_. Councils would have money and fewer people would even need benefits. The government would have so much extra cash they could even have tax cuts, or prop up even more failing privatised utilities and transport companies with subsidy so the bosses can still get their bonuses, or whatever else rightwingers would rather spend the money on.

Regarding other subreddit channels, there are other subreddit channels on Quakenet including Football related subreddits (which I won't mention here unless you really want me to).

In addition, there are more Football related chat rooms on Quakenet than there are on Freenode.

And that by writing that comment they were condoning and encouraging child molesters, helping people cheat the benefits system and trying to smuggle immigrants into the country illegally.

Not saying that people should go round to Nexxxeh's house and hurt them because that would be illegal but if they were not able to continue writing comments then it would stop child molesters, benefit cheats and illegal immigrants at the same time.

Obviously thats not what they are doing but its all too easy to write it up like that in a DM opinion column, which is what RJ has done.

Right, but the ban wasn't based purely on offence.

The offensive nature was a factor, but also were the fact it was homophobic and could re-enforce prejudices against gay people.  This is harmful.

I dunno, that doesn't feel particularly contradictory to me ... For example, in my idea of what a decent society looks like, there is no place for rabid racists of the BNP type. Unfortunately, people don't fit my idea of what society should be like - the rabid racists are there anyway. So now what? Well, I won't try to stop them from proving so ... but I also won't stop thinking that there shouldn't be people thinking like them. 

I mean, you can start arguing about semantics, of course... but I'm pretty sure railroadman meant that there *shouldn't* be a place amongst society for such abhorrent views. Just like the Littlejohns of this world believe there shouldn't be any place in society for, say, welfare scroungers or asylum cheaters or transgender teachers.

Deception as to quantity/quality/emotional state probably leaves consent intact, deception as to fact/nature/type/class probably undermines or even vitiates consent entirely.  So to take extreme cases, saying you're  good lover when you're not, wouldn't undermine consent and so couldn't be rape/assault, nor would saying you love the person, will still respect them in the morning etc.  Saying you're someone's legal partner when you're not (e.g. if they had amnesia) most likely would.  The situation is more grey in the middle, saying you are clear of sexually transmitted diseases, saying you are sterile, and maybe saying you share the same world view (which is what the under-cover police did).  Likewise, it seems that lying as to gender carries the same implications as lying as to being the person's partner, though you'd need to examine the exact nature of the decision here as it may be being decided on a different basis.  It might have implications for transgender people otherwise which seems very timely given what's in the news, and the law might be in need of some clarification on this given the state of the art/society etc..

So he had a form of payment the company would accept and yet he was raging so much he went to the press over it? Seems like a bit of an overreaction to me. And for what it is worth, this is what the bank of England has to say about legal tender and Scottish notes...

&gt; **Are Scottish &amp; Northern Ireland notes ""legal tender""?**
In short ‘No’ these notes are not ""legal tender""; furthermore, Bank of England notes are only legal tender in England and Wales.  Legal tender has, however, a very narrow technical meaning in relation to the settlement of debt.  If a debtor pays in legal tender the exact amount he/she owes under the terms of a contract (and in accordance with its terms), or pays this amount into court, he/she has good defence in law if he/she is sued for non-payment of the debt.
In ordinary everyday transactions, the term ""legal tender"" in its purest sense need not govern a note's acceptability in transactions.  The acceptability of a Scottish or Northern Ireland note as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved. If both parties are in agreement, Scottish and Northern Ireland notes can be used in England and Wales.  Holders of genuine Scottish and Northern Ireland notes are provided with a level of protection similar to that provided to holders of Bank of England notes.  This is because the issuing banks must back their note issue using a combination of Bank of England notes, UK coin and funds in an interest bearing bank account at the Bank of England.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"""Causing offence"" alone is rarely the deciding factor, though. It usually boils down to a judgement call about whether ""objective"" harm may ensue as a result of a particular ad. Each must be judged on its own merits. I – and many others, clearly – believe there is a significant risk that this *particular* ad would do more than merely cause offence. And therein lies the rub: some members of our society are vulnerable and need the rest of us to act on their behalf. I mean you wouldn't want posters depicting explicit sex or violence openly displayed for children to see, would you? No, a civilised society *has* to have boundaries. 

*'But who gets to decide what's acceptable and what's not?'* you may ask. Well politicians of course. They're the people we've elected to vest authority in on matters of public interest – and by ""public interest"" I mean *everyone* in our society, not just the majority. That they sometimes get it wrong by being overzealous or ruling with a bias towards their own political beliefs rather than the good of society, is just the nature of democracy I'm afraid. When they do that it's up to us to vote them out and get another lot in who'll do things differently. It's a far from perfect system, of course, but it seems to be the best we have for now.

Its like your suddenly a second class citizen and the money in your pocket, that you've worked for, is no good anymore.  You might have been spending it freely before because people and businesses usually do take it as courtesy.  If their bank takes it they'll take it and a lot of people who handle cash do tend to be familiar with Scottish notes (they're not that rare).   

Usually when its refused it happens unexpectedly at an inconvenient or awkward time, because someone is not aware of this courtesy - I got kicked out of pub whilst paying for a round of drinks by a Saffir bartender who kept my £30 (twenty and a tenner from two different banks).  He was going to call the police on me for passing dodgy notes, I obviously wanted my money back, and from his end it started to get a bit heated; ""crooked little shit"" I think he called me.

Sure you may think it is crap but it is nothing compared to what it has been in the past. Living standards are far higher, crime is far lower. NHS is far better as are the schools. Roads are crapper but you can't have everything.

You say you want to leave so how come you haven't already? £30 sees you in France in less than a couple of hours. Is it because you wouldn't have a comparable welfare state to prop you up? Is it because you're a typical Brit who hasn't learned another language? 

I've looked at moving to other countries but whilst they all do some things better than us, they also do some things far worse and the overall package doesn't make it worth moving. I could bugger off to France. I speak sufficient french to get by, the wife is progressing nicely, I could sell up here and move there mortgage free. But for example one downside is whilst the houses are on large plots of land and relatively cheap, they're also falling down and if you do them up, the govt taxes you which is why most are in a state of disrepair. Think internet access is bad here? Nothing compared to France

Maybe you should move from where you are in the country to somewhere else as someone has suggested. The town I grew up in is now a shithole.

If you'd prefer not to debate due to feeling under the weather I totally  understand.  I'm not attacking your opinion here just using it to outline my take on things. 

First of all its not a non-existent currency:
Its in circulation, its widely accepted, it has an economic and social value.  But its interesting that you said it is.  Part of the problem is that people have this perception of Scottish currency having less value than bank of England notes - implying its a sop to a bunch of chippy scots who are sensitive about their identities.  When really Scottish currency has been around for a very long time and the issuing of their notes has an fascinating history that people would do well to be aware of.  For instance what if Euros became more popular and widely accepted, acheiving parity with the pound and then becoming more ubiqitous so much so that multinational high street chains in the UK started refusing to take pounds due to a perceived risk of forgery?  

The risk element is an interesting thing; on one side you have a business that feels its necessary to refuse Scottish notes it feels are alien and possibly fake. On the flipside its tantamount to saying to a person that they are untrustworthy because their system of exchange tokens is regionally different, so by extension their values are seen as untrustworthy too.  It goes right to the heart of how people are embodiments of national values, and any discrimination of that is by extension a discrimination of their national character.    
The point I wan to make is that value in the form of money is symbolically massively important, and tied up with lots of things to do with identity, labour power and status in myriad ways. For instance- Bank cards are still distrusted by lots of older people for precisely the same reasons that your company refuses Scottish notes, they are seen as alien and inherently risky.

I think Welsh has got an uncool vibe with it, at least at school age. There was an English speaking school across the road from my secondary school and we were dubbed ""welshies"". And it was definitely uncool to speak welsh even in the welsh school. It wasn't until I finished school I realised how glad I am that I can speak the language.

Snobbery from native speakers is disgusting. Luckily doesn't seem too commonplace, but I really do harshly judge any fellow Welsh-speakers who are anything less than really encouraging to learners.

I will also look into simplifying and de-personalising my own spreadsheet so that I can upload it to the community next week.

A warning when it comes to spreadsheets: it can be easy - even fun - to set them up, the hard part is keeping them updated.
 
One thing I can recommend to make the effect of your spreadsheet designed budgeting system more real and self-sustaining is to set up different bank accounts for different things. 

As an example, I use the following system of accounts:

*Bills &amp; Distribution* – Where my monthly salary gets paid into and then distributed to the other accounts, leaving enough in to cover all bills and regular budgeted expenses. All my direct debits and standing orders come out of here, so I don’t really need to worry about them as I know I have enough in there to cover them. I make sure I leave one third of any quarterly bills in there every month so that they are covered when they come out. I don’t keep the debit card for this account in my wallet, as I would never use it. It has a small overdraft facility (a few hundred) in case a bill is slightly larger than usual one month.

*Regular Saver* - A high interest account where I pay in the same amount in every month. Never to be touched unless in a real emergency. No cash card. No overdraft.

*Short Term Savings Account* - For annual or infrequent but semi-predictable large ticket expenses, such as buying Christmas and Birthday presents or buying intercity train tickets or budget flights to see friends once in a while. This is also where I save for holidays. If I had a car, this would be where I would save for insurance, MOT and tax as well. Does have a visa debit card, which is normally not in my wallet, so I have to make a conscious decision to dig it out to use it. Intentionally does not have an overdraft. I do not feel guilty about using this account as long as I use it for the things I have set it aside for.

*Spending Account* - What’s left every month. I know I can blow this money during the month and not care. This is the card I carry in my wallet. I don’t have to feel guilty for using it. It doesn’t have an overdraft so that when it’s gone, it’s gone.

*Joint Accounts* - I also have Bills, Short Term Savings and Spending accounts with my SO for household cost and bills. Works in the same way as my personal accounts.",0,1364043546,null,0,1364045630,0,c90xx32,t3_1aq8xj,t1_c90xx32,t3_1aq8xj,null,1431677413,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Additionally there are [just under 1.6 million Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Religion) in the UK, so even if we assume all terror related arrests are from the Muslim community (which given the recent resurgence of the IRA is a big assumption), that's only 0.015% of the Muslim population implicated last year.

Parents, some of them are probably homophobic, nationalistic and hate all people who are different. Their worrying about children was probably more focused on their personal beliefs than actual bad influence.

Also, what was that guy's solution? So if anybody who decides to change his sex needs to completely change their life as well? Even change of job? Maybe that job was his dream... and in fact whole sex change and job and being ridiculed probably have led to his suicide and I bet DM played part in it.

Take a bunch of jobs that the government employ people to do that could be done by anyone, street sweeper, graffiti cleaner, rubbish collector etc.  As people retire don't rehire people to these positions.  Keep a core of workers who are great at their jobs and keep them on as supervisors and pay them more.  

Now people claiming unemployment benefit have to work a couple of days a week at these jobs to earn their benefit.  
Voila!  They are no longer a drain on the system.  It also saves the government money which they can use to increase unemployment benefit.  They are working but not so much they cannot look for employment.  People claiming unemployment benefit while also working on the side will probably stop doing it.  People will feel like they are contributing to society more and will be keener to find a proper job because hey, they're already working right?  Might as well get paid a decent wage instead.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; The basis on which I originally cited it was the part of your comment which I kindly quoted directly above the citation. Specifically you claimed that the gap between 80% of offences being committed by men and 95% of prisoners being men was largely explained by the nature of the crimes men committed.

Your link does absolutely nothing to state that a lower proportion of offences committed by women are violent as compared to the proportion of offences committed by men. 80% of all crimes are committed by men, but [returning to my original link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime) 91% of murders in the US are committed by men, and [99% of rapists were men](http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF). The reason why a higher proportion of male criminals are in prison is that a higher proportion of their crimes are violent. It's that simple.

&gt; I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that Ms. Grant would like those alternatives to custody to be used as alternatives to custody by not sentencing people to custody but using the alternatives to custody instead. That will necessarily reduce the number of women in prison, unless police are going to start picking some random women off the street to imprison in place of the ones sentenced to alternatives to custody.

I don't think it necessarily means that at all. I think you could equally say that there should be credible alternatives to custody for non-violent offenders who have been in care, have children who need caring for, and who have been subject to abuse in their personal lives. These are all factors that the article notes affect women more than men. They're therefore factors that are frequently important when dealing with women but not when dealing with the prison population as a whole (which is broadly male). So after identifying this group of people for whom prison sentences are undesirable and for whom current non-custodial sentences do not present a good solution, the solution is to develop more non-custodial options for judges.

Now, there is no suggestion that if a man had committed a non-violent offence, had mitigating factors such as abuse in his personal life, and was the primary carer for children that these proposed non-custodial sentences would not be an option for him. So they're not discriminatory measures - they're measures aimed to improve sentencing for a specific group of people, who happen to be disproportionately female.

Examining individual demographics can allow us to discover issues that would not be visible when looking at the population overall. If there's a fundamental problem in the justice system that affects women more than men, it's not sexist to address that issue. I do concede the article makes it sound as if women will receive special treatment in places, but I think that's due to a concise journalistic style.",1,1364051187,null,0,false,0,c90za42,t3_1auoq4,t1_c90za42,t1_c90xy23,null,1431678056,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

now, the two are inseperable. The little one fallows the big one everywhere and the big one loves it (though still has moments of frustration now and then). it's nto ""my little sister"" to her but ""our baby"".

Although, under the terms of the Coinage Act, which covers legal tender, you wouldn't be able to demand change.

My example is that if you went into a bar and set up a tab, had a couple of pints, so your tab was effectively about £6, if you paid with a £50 as legal tender, under the Coinage Act, you wouldn't receive any change. If you did, then your £50 wasn't used as legal tender.

It wasn't meant to - that's your side of the argument, remember? I'm arguing that differences in the proportions of violent crime are not sufficient to explain the disparity in sentencing that results in men being overrepresented in the prison population relative to the number of crimes committed. I fully accept that women commit fewer violent crimes and at no point have I implied otherwise.

&gt; 99% of rapists were men.

Women cannot be convicted of the crime of rape (except as participants when a man is present) in the UK or most of the US (where your statistics are inexplicably from).

&gt; The reason why a higher proportion of male criminals are in prison is that a higher proportion of their crimes are violent. It's that simple.

No, it isn't that simple, as the statistics in Philip Davies speech clearly lay out. You appear to be of the belief that a lie repeated often enough becomes the truth, or that ""it's obvious innit"" is a valid argument.

&gt; If there's a fundamental problem in the justice system that affects women more than men, it's not sexist to address that issue.

It is if you address it in a way that excludes men who are also affected.

What?

&gt; The problem with this conspiracy theory of yours...

You mean yours, right? Mine would be warfare to retain control over imperialised lands gotten through direct assault or cultivating various terroristic proxies whether it be juntas, factions, ""islamists"", and administrations sympathetic to western neo-colonial interests.

You aren't racist because you call out some muslims as being extreme, you are racist because you say things like ""muslims are extreme"". That's quite an extreme world view you have and I'm pretty sure if you were born speaking arabic you'd be exactly the type that you seek to rail against. You'd probably love it even more. You seem the sort of person that would get off on knowing that your wife is your property who has to walk around veiled and never in the company of other men. You'd relish the chance of putting to death your social rivals because you are god's preferred class.

Part of me thinks you are an elaborate novelty account, perhaps even one to ruin UKIPs online reputation. If earnest, then another part of me pities you for having such an empty life that you have to find joy in various phantoms of hubris like ""getting to bomb the French for a bit"".

Shannon will have anything to add to this statement.

*The statement reads:*
St Hugh’s College has advocated successfully for the University of Oxford, supported
by the Conference of Colleges of the University, to carry out a review of the present
Financial Guarantee Policy. On completion of the review, recommendations will be put
to the University’s Council and the Conference of Colleges for consideration. It is
anticipated that the process will be completed by September 2013.

St Hugh’s College and the History Faculty of the University of Oxford have jointly made
available to Mr Shannon a place on the one year MSc in Economic and Social History,
the course for which he originally applied.

Both parties have agreed to pay their own costs and no moneys have changed hands.
Both parties send their particular thanks to His Honour Judge Armitage QC for his
diligent handling of the case to date and his patience and generosity in affording the
parties sufficient time to reach an agreement. They also send their thanks to the Court
staff of the Manchester County Court, for their helpful assistance.""

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"there are a lot of factors involved, one of the main ones was the 'buy to let' scheme which was designed to make tory voters - basically moderately affluent people were given subsidised and incentivised to purchase houses as a 2ndry income, this did two things; it pushed up house prices and rent but also it turned a whole class of average people into property owning tycoons that had personal interest in property markets; hence why moneybox type programs obsess over how great rising rents are...  

The rich tories with massive property portfolios use the aspiring middle classes to justify rules, regulations and policies which massively benefit landlords and property investors pass without question.  Meanwhile the cost of rent is increasing which means people can't afford to live, which means society is falling to pieces - hence it getting to the point where people couldn't afford to pay their debts and so defaulted on loans so frequently the banking system needed an injection of cash to ballance it - however this has simply stopped rents and property prices falling, which means people still can't afford to live and are simply building up debts to default on again...  
  
The simple fact is the lowest earning people (those in social or lower-rent housing) simply can't afford to subsidise the mortgages of the aspiring middle classes - certainly in the climate of today where they're given very little help and almost no access to self improvement or social betterment; there should be significant subsidies in place for people owning a single home and systems in place to limit the buying of second properties as investments -certainly if the intention is to pay the mortgage by renting it out.

[The Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) particularly s.149 is relevant but unlikely to be helpful because of the exceptions in s.3 and 4 of Schedule 18 of the same Act. It excludes judges and the House of Commons from the public duty of non-discrimination. Technically the police are part of the executive and under the authority of the Home Sec. and i'm not clear if s.4 gives an exemption to the police by proxy; it certainly gives it to MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. 

There is a Directive from the EU, [Directive 2002/73/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:269:0015:0020:EN:PDF), known as The Equal Treatment but it is primarily focused on 'equal
treatment of men and women in matters of employment
and occupation' arising as it did out of [Art. 157 of the TFEU](http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_157) which only dealt with equal pay so is unlikely to have much effect. I have never read it all the way through so it may have some hidden instruction on it but I doubt it. The EU never likes to meddle in the criminal law of member states and rarely gets involved in justice system debates. The EU is not allowed to say what criminal sanctions should be only that there ought to be some. 

The ECHR might be helpful if you can establish that the government **may** have breaching another of your rights under the convention. Article 14 is what you could call 'parasitic' in that it can only be breached if 'hosted' by another possible breach of a different right. The other breach does not need proving. So what other right might have been breached irrespective of discrimination? Well, your best bet is Art. 5 which give us a right to liberty not to be detained unlawfully etc. Again you don't have to end up actually proving the unlawful detention only that you were deprived of your Art.5 rights lawfully or unlawfully and that it was because of discrimination. 

It might hard to show it was because of discrimination because men will be imprisoned for crimes they had been judged to have committed not because of discrimination alone but a good lawyer could make a convincing argument that while he was not convicted for being a man he was in fact *imprisoned* for being a man because if he had been a woman he would have got off with a less serious sentence. I have a sneaking suspicion the ECtHR wouldn't kick up too much fuss though because the scheme consists of putting fewer people in prison rather than more. The court would most likely ask the UK to extend the program to men in some form. 

Interestingly there is a discrepancy in that the Equality Act exempts judges from non-discrimination but the ECHR does not and there would probably be conflict over this if it was brought to court. Yet another reason why British law is not sufficient to protect our human rights at the moment and why the ECHR should not go or at least not until we have a credible alternative **already** in place before it goes. Screw you Teresa May.

I don't know what makes you think I'm a ""lefty"", some of the largest militaries have come from the pseudo-left. Perhaps you through that ""insult"" at everyone that disagrees with you. I'm an anarchist so left and right mean the same thing to me: centralisations of power that lead to abuse.

Not really, for a number of years you've said racist things on Reddit which is why people call you racist, but perhaps that is the wrong word. Supremacist better encapsulates your mentality, hence why you'd love to see people ""flying the English flag"" and so on. Your life must be so empty of meaning if you have to find it in the flapping of cloth.

&gt; immigration

I could take this topic seriously because Britain has some of the highest population densities of Europe but people like you are fixated on muslims and this is perhaps the most important reason you are racist. You likely never complain about non-doms owning all manner of things, the olympic village being sold to the Qatari royal family at a knock down price, dirty Greeks and Russians buying citizenship, the worst of British setting up camp in Spain, and to top it off you want to emigrate to America with the hope of being able to buy yourself a better life! The guy that hates immigration wants to be an immigrant! You are a joke of a man that suffers too great from pride, because it is only the humble person that can better his life as hubris generally already claims supremacy. Something tells me your life is shit to underwhelming, I imagine you don't drive the car you really want, or live in the house you want so you pine for the ""good old days"" that UKIP pretend existed whilst pinning many ills of the present onto the muslim threat.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"Which website?

Legal tender applies to debts (more or less). In the case of normal contracts for goods or services (such as buying something in a shop), what is required to be paid under the contract depends on the terms of the contract, but the default position is that any debt created must be paid in legal tender.

So when you go into a shop to buy something (a newspaper, let's say), you put some money on the counter, the cashier takes it, and you go your separate ways. Legally, what happened was that you made an offer (""I will give you this stuff for the newspaper"") and the cashier (acting as agent for the shop's owners, I assume) accepts that offer by taking the money. Thus you can offer anything you want (including coins, Scottish banknotes, foreign money, tennis balls etc.) but the cashier doesn't have to accept any of it.

However, if the contract creates a debt, then legal tender comes into play. So, let's say now you go into a restaurant and order a meal. By ordering that meal you are entering into a contract - you make an offer by ordering (""I will pay the price in the menu for the food"") and they accept it (by taking your order). That means that if they fulfil their side (by providing the food, subject to various implied terms), you now owe them money, and the default position is that you have to pay that in legal tender.

Now, when you come to pay, the restaurant can *choose* to accept something else (subject to the rules on variation, accepting less etc.), but the point of legal tender is that if you offer them the payment in legal tender, they *have* to accept it. But they don't have to accept anything else (because you owe them the money in legal tender, not in Scottish notes, or tennis balls etc).^1

Now, in terms of criminal offences, offering the Scottish notes may go some way to a defence (under the English ""[making off without payment](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/31/section/3)"" offence, it may remove the dishonesty element or the intention to avoid paying), but while you might be able to get away with that, you would still owe them the money - they may just have to sue you for it.


^1 If they had some sign up saying they accept cheques or credit cards, that would probably be enough to allow that kind of payment as well.

true,Sir_Fancy_Pants,null,null,"&gt;the point of legal tender is that if you offer them the payment in legal tender, they have to accept it.

this is not so: all legal tender is, is a recognised payment in order to avoid being sued for non payment in the courts, i.e a shop is entitled to refuse BoE notes and only accept tennis balls (if it so wishes), if you engage in this transaction (i.e the prices are all in tennis balls), criminal proceedings are different from civil proceedings (which was my original point).

I.e a shop can refuse payment of BoE notes, it just cannot sue you for failure to pay, if you do provide BoE notes, as BoE notes are considered settlement of the debt via the court, however if you were to have a contract in which all payment was expressly outlined as ""tennis balls only"" you would be able to sue not for failure to pay, but breach of contract.

As a completely somewhat related note; what do you know wrt to if you order a meal and pay for it (to both parties satisfaction), your legal entitlement to the remaining food, i.e my understanding is that the contract you hold in a restaurant is a service of dining, and not a specific order of the food, i.e you are not legally entitled to the ""left overs"" of the food you ordered (no one would actually in reality ever stop you )",0,1364058630,null,0,false,0,c9116a8,t3_1aun8r,t1_c9116a8,t1_c910u1c,null,1431678945,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This woman randomly overheard a private joke, not intended for her at all, not directed at her or any women in the hall. She then, breaking PyCon's T&amp;Cs and common decency, snapped a photo of the two people who made the joke and put it on her 10k follower Twitter account. One man, a father of 3, has been fired from his job for it.

She has, thankfully, been fired from her job for breaking the T&amp;Cs of PyCon and for not having any common decency.

This is what pisses me off most about the Scottish notes chat - the notes exist purely as an investment for BoS, RBS and Clydesdale. They are making money by giving out promissory notes rather than legal tender - and I'm supposed to take that on as part of my identity?",0,1364063404,null,0,false,0,c912hvm,t3_1aun8r,t1_c912hvm,t1_c910bid,null,1431679572,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Akinto6,smith,Smith,"* It's about a 900yo alien who travels through time and space in his TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimensions in Space) which looks like a 1960's police box because it got stuck like that while trying to fit in when the Doctor first landed on earth in the 60s.

* Instead of dying, timelords (The Doctor's race) are able to regenerate every cell in their body and transform into a new persona, with a different personality and taste but still essentially the same person (kind of like how your taste evolves as you grow up, only obviously faster)

* Okay if you're not sure if you're going to like Doctor Who, I always recommend two episodes you should watch before deciding it's not your thing, because as you've noticed Doctor Who can be hit or miss because of the wide range of writers and ideas that can be used in one episode. Try watching 3x10 Blink and 5x01 The Eleventh Hour. Blink is a Doctor-light episode, it introduces a character that's only featured in that episode who goes through the adventure with little help from the Doctor, it's not the standard for the show but it is an amazing example of how imaginative and well written an episode can be. The Eleventh Hour is the first episode featuring the eleventh Doctor where he meets a new companion and everything, so it's very approachable by new viewers. If you do not like either of these episodes, I doubt you'll like the show, but if you do like those episodes I recommend you start watching from series 1 (which aired in 2005) and stick through the bad or mediocre episodes because you miss out on way too much if you don't do that.

true,throwaway5192,null,null,"&gt; The point was to show that woman aren't batting their eyelashes to magistrates and juries to get off the hook as Hammyman suggested. 

But your statistics *don't* show that. They show that the female prison population has risen roughly in line with the number of women being convicted.

&gt; We should be alarmed because the female prisoner population should not be rising so disproportional to the male population when men are still overrepresented in all areas of crime.

It should if the number of women committing crimes is rising so disproportionately to the number of men committing crimes. Are you saying that women who commit crimes shouldn't go to prison because men commit them more? What bearing does men's crime rate have on this at all?

&gt; It could suggest women are being treated more punitively as more and more attention is given to female offenders.

Prove that women are being treated more punitively than men and I'll be suitably alarmed, I promise, but the prevalence of your sort of kneejerk reaction based on nonsense comparisons leads me to believe the opposite is more likely.

&gt; Seeing it as a flat increase in offending so therefore more prisoners is a huge simplification of the issue.

But the moment a cost is introduced for healthcare, people will notice. It's political suicide. Far better to preserve the veneer of free healthcare whilst privatising the everloving shit out of it.

The point here is that politicians want to privatise stuff, not to save money. It's just convenient to use saving government money as the motivation for privatisation. Making people pay rather than the government doesn't change the profitability at all. What it does do is risks politicial backlash. Why risk that for no extra profit?

It's simply not in their interests to instigate a US-Style system.

No sorry I disagree, and that goes against scientific usage of terms, they are *precisely* what make you the sex you are.

Oh, you were doing so well until this point.

If you have...as the UK does ...and as the US does ... a welfare nation where entitlements are provided, having open borders is a disaster.

You are begging for illegals to flood in and tank your economy.

We are dealing with big costs in the USA.  We graduate over 50,000 illegals from our public schools every year.  How do they even get IN to public schools?

And let's not BS... when I lived in Europe in the 80's there was a big problem with Muslim immigrants NOT blending in to the population and keeping to themselves. Often when I lived there large groups of Muslim boys would chase my friends and me down the street until we finally had to go in a McDonald's or something to escape them.  One new year's eve, they got ahold of my friend's younger sister and felt her up all over while she screamed.  Our guys DOVE over the crowd of them punching left and right to get to her while some of the gals flagged down police and told them what happened.  The police response?  Ah well...it's a crowd.

Either Europe is failing to assimilate its Muslims or Muslims are failing to be willing to be multicultural.

I think it's the second.

But no... there's no sense in a ""no borders"" attitude.  Because if that's what you want ... be prepared to have your welfare system collapse.

CAL is eternally a child in the library, so if Clara is a representation of CAL then CAL *has* changed her actual appearance for the embodiment because Clara is not a child.  This clip doesn't refute that CAL could have chosen any body form she liked to reach out to the doctor - including different ages.  I think if we're talking about a computer making embodiments across time and space, saying it's ""unlikely"" she would change her appearance seems strangely short sighted.


&gt;If it were a physical copy of CAL, the Doctor would recognize her as a child. Even if it were a different actor to us, the child should look the same to him in the show. 

I don't think the prequal girl is physically identical to CAL. The girl in the prequel (to me) is older than CAL was in Silence in the Library.  Even if she wasn't older and was identical - the only part of CAL the doctor saw was her face on a white blob - I wouldn't be surprised if seeing the whole person would make remembering the face harder.  If prequel girl is indeed older but exactly what CAL would have looked like at that age, (and Clara is obviously older than both of them) you can't expect the Doctor to be able to see a person only as a child and then be able to identify them at all ages?
