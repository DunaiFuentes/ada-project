true,pow-wow,null,null,"I find that Bistro Pierre and its sibling restaurants Bistro Franc (Hanover St) and Bistro Jacques (Hardman St) are nothing to write home about. There's been a lazy attempt to recreate a 'Parisian' decor but it has not succeeded. The food is OK but again, it's not really an accurate representation of Parisian cuisine and it's not exciting enough to make up for it. I think they charge too much for what they actually have to offer.

Bearing in mind you are 17 and probably have a limited price range, here's some nice affordable restaurants I would recommend:

VILLA ROMANA, Wood Street.

Family-run Italian restaurant. I've been eating here for years. The food matches up to (and often excels) that of the more expensive Italian restaurants in town. They have a wide range of carnivorous and vegetarian dishes on their menu. Even the pickiest eater could find something here to enjoy. They've gone all-out on the decor, complete with ostentatious murals of the typical picturesque Tuscan countryside- it's a bit tacky, but in a nice way. Very unpretentious. The waiters are all very friendly, especially that soft-spoken chap whose name escapes me. Casual dining, you don't need to dress up. I recommend the pizza.


ZORBA'S, corner of Leece St and Ranelagh St

Family-run Greek restaurant. Greek food is something that has never properly translated to Liverpool. I suspect the reason for this is that most of the Greek restaurants in Liverpool are actually run by Cypriots, whose cuisine is somewhat different (in the case of Romio's Restaurant), or perhaps that English people looking to recapture their holiday magic in Faliraki have forced Greek chefs to 'water down' their dishes into something the lowest common denominator can enjoy (in the case of the hen-night mecca that is Christakis' Restaurant).

That being said, Zorba's is your best bet for Greek food in Liverpool! There's a wide array of brilliant starters that are great for sharing. Lots of great meat and fish dishes. Vegetarian options are there too. There's great value for money here. You'll get a large portion for a reasonable prices. The decor is typical of English-Greek restaurants- lots of white stucco, pictures of beautiful islands, classical busts of philosophers. The staff are very friendly and won't look at you funny if you turn up in trainers. I recommend the spinach pie (spanakopita).


LUCHA LIBRE, Wood St

One of the most exciting places to eat at the moment. Real Mexican cuisine recreated passionately and perfectly. Their menu breaks down into 'Street Food', which is basically light lunch eating, or larger main meals. There's a great selection of starters and side dishes to go with whatever you choose. Check out the wall of hot sauces too. You can spend ages sampling the most interesting looking bottles (El Yucateco, the green one, try that). This is very casual dining- if you're comfortable with the prospect of accidentally spilling taco meat and salsa all over yourself whilst trying to impress your bird, then go here. Not for the faint-tongued. I recommend Tacos Al Pastor and the stuffed Jalapenos.


These are just three of my favourites. If you're looking for something else then give me a shout and I should be able to help you.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"While I agree that ""clinical, versatile"" etc would definitely sum up AVB type players for the most part, I would argue we need gritty, never-say-die players like Dempsey as well.

As a squad player, I think he's a great acquisition, and I disagree that he doesn't fit into AVB's system; I think as a left-sided cut-in scoring winger, he can do very well for us. Obviously he will never take Bale's spot, and Gylfi is younger and more talented.

But, as the above says, just dismissing Dempsey as a poor player who happens to get a lucky goal now and again is way too simplistic. Look at his scoring form the last 6 years in the Premier League; he's scored at least 6 goals in the league (his tally from this year so far) in each of the last 6 seasons; including 12 and 17 last year and the year before. You don't just accidentally score 6 or more goals in the Premier league 6 years running.

Also, I just want to reply to quite frankly moronic comments [like the top one](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1cxa0w/its_the_end_of_the_legal_system_as_we_know_it/c9kunml)on this thread.

&gt;Firstly, this gives the clearest sign yet that capitalism is eating its own children. Even the servants of capital - such as the police and now the lawyers . 

To be a criminal barrister do the following (it's outlined in the post at the top):

* Get very good Alevels
* Go to a law school and get **at least** a 2.1
* Pay for bar school (usually £18K or so)
* Do a year's pupillage, the first half of which you may not be paid for.
* Interview against other applicants and hope you get lucky. 

And what do these **capitalist swine** get for all this? For abandoning a career in the city (which, if they're good enough for the bar they're likely good enough to get), working harder than most students at uni and paying for an expensive postgrad?

**£16-17K per year**. 

That's about £3K more than a starbucks **barrista** working 40 hours a week would earn. A junior criminal barrister will be doing a hell of a lot more hours. 

Criminal Barristers are **not** in it for the money. A middle aged crim-barrister will make about the same as a primary school teacher. After the legal aid cuts, they'll make significantly less. 


&gt;Secondly, see how those ""professional associations"" like the Bar Council, the Law Society and the British Medical Association are really unions when push comes to shove

They're professional associations. The bar council serves the interests of Barristers. It has never pretended to be some sort of 'gentleman's club' and calling it a guild is stupidity on your part: defending their members interests is precisely what guilds were for. 


&gt;Well, we've moved far enough away from the carefully contrived artifice of procedural democracy in other ways and people have got used to the mask slipping periodically, so why not take it off completely and be done with it?

If that does happen it's because of **fucking people like you**

Legal aid barristers, as mentioned, can make at most the pay of a teacher at the end of their careers. 

The big multi-millionaire QCs you hear about do private practice, something that the legal aid cuts won't affect, and that is paid for by private individuals completely.

The whole issue with these cuts is because people **like yourself and most of the public** think that legal aid goes to champagne quaffing fat cats, it means that politically the bar association can do fuck all to campaign because the public hates them. 


The **fucking delicious irony** of this is that the sole thing keeping criminal barristers from matching the public image of them as rich bastards **is their principles**. 

These guys have all, to the last one, given up a far more lucrative career in commercial law, banking or corporate because they wanted to help people. 

The **sole** thing that kept these folks in the criminal bar was the idea that, after studying and achieving to a level that most of the country will never attain, they will get **at least** a semi-comfortable  middle class lifestyle later on in life. **After making less than a cleaner for the first 5 years of their life of course**. 

Now that the government has taken that away, why even bother? The lad who wrote the blog at the top of my post isn't going to keep working after the cuts. He's making the same now as he would as if he's started working after his GCSEs **right now**. Less than that?

Fuck it, he'll go to the Chancery and bill £1000 an hour for his services. 

And him and any other lawyer who ever gets in trouble will be able to afford the expensive representation. 


Edit: Just to be clear here. No one in the legal profession thinks there's a single bar. There's a criminal bar,a commericial bar, corporate bar, family (law) bar, etc.

Their opinions are generally odious, ill-thought-out, reactionary, and unfortunately very profitable, just like many Tory policies (such as this one).

That said, there is a modicum of evidence that suggests that excessive porn use (to the point of serious addiction) can modify your brain chemistry in such a way that normal sexual behaviour becomes more difficult, and your general well-being may be affected. If you want to see stats to back this up, the guys at /r/pornfree have some research they can point you to. A starting point is the ""your brain on porn"" film, linked in their sidebar.

However, it remains perfectly possible to enjoy pornography without suffering those ill-effects (just as it is possible to drink alcohol without becoming an alcoholic) and therefore knee-jerk reactions like this are totally inappropriate. Still, it's not worth dismissing the dangers totally out of hand.

&gt;If someone is seriously that determined to look at porn in public, then it's safe to assume they'll have at least 120GB of the stuff on their laptop they can look at instead.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I finished my joint course with Economics 2 years ago and unfortunately I don't remember what the textbook we used was, sorry!

With pills, while off the shelf meds like paracetamol have many competitors, the life saving meds for cancer treatments etc are covered by long patents I believe, meaning you can only get it from one place. This situation is already the norm today.

Under privatised health care, you would expect cheaper substitutes to be used when it comes to medicine and surgeons etc.

Say for example, I go in with a horrible throat infection. The best course of action of to be prescribed a course of strong antibiotics but perhaps these are much more expensive than a weaker type of antibiotics. A doctor would probably want to prescribe the stronger one because it is more likely to cure me faster.

But a doctor who has to micro-manage their budget and cut costs would instead opt for the weaker medicine, hoping that it would be ""good enough"". Perhaps in this case, the weaker medicine just takes longer to act and I feel discomfort for a week or two longer. No big deal. But what if it doesn't work? What if I'm already in a weakened and vulnerable state? What if the medicine is so slow that the infection spreads to my lungs and cause permanent damage?

The same goes for surgery. What if the surgeon and tools I am assigned to are not experienced/high quality enough? Maybe they came straight out of med school but they're cheaper to hire? If something goes wrong, a strongly worded complaint or company boycott isn't going to cut it!

See, it's a difference in basic mentality:

A government funded NHS has social well-being as its core mandate. Budgets need to be managed but if high expense is necessary, it'll have to be done. This is why it always seems ""inefficient"". Because good care doesn't come cheap!

A privately managed healthcare system has profit maximisation as its mandate. This goes right to the core of the concept. **The feature that makes privately managed industries efficient is the steadfast adherence to the principle of profit maximisation!** But you can't prioritise both profit and social well-being at the same time! So with profit maximisation, in an industry which deals in living necessities (ie. consumers *must* consume healthcare or die), quality by necessity must take a back seat, no matter how much you legislate it.

This boils down to the basic weakness with capitalism that people frequently don't realise. Capitalism will pretty much always lead to the most economically efficient result. We know this. What is does *not* do, is lead to a *fair* result. And by fair, I mean socially equal.

If there is one industry in all of humanity that should be *fair*, it should be healthcare. Poor people might be expected to eat less food, eat cheap food, dress in shabby clothes, live in crap houses, sleep in the cold, but for god's sake, they should still be able to expect decent healthcare. To me, that's a basic human right. This is why I believe that healthcare should not be handed over to capitalism and why I believe it shouldn't be privatised in any way.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; but i don't believe there is a conspiracy in Europe where research seems to be scientific and legit.

I agree.  Furthermore, I'd say that the majority of the work undertaken in the US is also of a high standard and scientifically rigorous.  

The problem is not so much the science that is done, but the science that isn't done.  Scientists don't get to choose what they can and can't research because those decisions are made by people who have been appointed with a particular goal - not to research the health risks (and potential benefits) of drugs, but to discourage their use.  Results that don't conform to this agenda are not published.  The NIDA are *not allowed* to sanction results that do anything but discourage drug use.

&gt; Scroll down to the mental health section to see what their assessment is.

They say:

&gt; There is growing evidence that people with serious mental illness, including depression and psychosis, are more likely to use cannabis or have used it for long periods of time in the past.  

Lots of correlation (which certainly demands further investigation) but as yet, no causative link.   If I recall correctly, it's estimated to be about 1% of the population who may be at risk due to genetic factors.  I think it's hard to justify the continued prohibition of cannabis based on scaremongering about something that is unlikely to affect the vast majority of users.  It certainly isn't a ""mental health timebomb"" by any stretch of the imagination (although I don't wish to downplay the potential risks to someone who is vulnerable - a friend of mine had a mental breakdown triggered by a caffeine overdose, believe it or not, and it wasn't fun).

&gt; To be honest it just seems to me like you want to find reasons to distrust all research because it is telling you in many cases what you don't want to hear. 

Not at all.  My apologies if I gave the impression of being anti-science, that's not my position at all.  I want to hear the truth, even if it's inconvenient for me.  Not to mention the fact that I have kids approaching the age where they might start experimenting with drugs.  I'd like to be honest with them and tell them what we do and *don't* know about drugs.  So far, I'm not convinced either way.

However, I am very much against the war on drugs because I think it's a pointless exercise that does more damage in the long term than the drugs themselves.  It especially annoys me that the war on drugs is hampering research that could give us the answers, even if they're not the ones we would like to hear.  Sure, I would love to learn that cannabis cures cancer and drinking beer makes you healthy, but I'm not going to stick my fingers in my ears and say ""Lah lah lah, I'm not listening"" if the science says something else.  If only we could persuade politicians to do the same.

The real danger is that the true risks of drug use (and there are plenty, even for the ""softer"" drugs like cannabis) are being obscured by hysterical scaremongering.  Furthermore, research that could lead to ""safer"" drugs is being thwarted.  One interesting line of research suggests that cannabis with lower leves of THC and higher levels of CBD are less likely to cause psychosis and may even help prevent it (CBD is thought to be the plant's natural ""antidote"" to the deleterious effect of THC).  Can I buy some of this ""safer"" cannabis?  Of course not!  Drugs are bad, m'kay!

true,[deleted],null,null,"The only reason I was privy to any of this was because I made friends with the IT department (consisting of one guy who I'm pretty sure was living the rest of his life on some sort of witness protection programme due to past company).  Most people working there were quite precious middle-class types who weren't really sure what to make of the 50something (sort of) crazy guy who worked like buggery all day every day in what was effectively a cupboard room - no windows - just servers.  

Anyway - I would treat him like a real person, and in return he did the same to me - which was novel for both of us (for him because of the above mentioned, and for me - because I was a low paid front line 'assistant' type).  I also knew a fair bit about computers and liked to party - where as he used to party - hard - and was now an IT bro.

Anyway, after a while we became sort of real friends, instead of work friends, and he would let me know about stuff that was fucked up - and not just *that it was fucked up* like you hear all the time - but *why* it was.  Of course he could only speak from the perspective of the IT department, but it made sense that it was the same for every department of the NHS.  

He would tell me how - if he could source this hardware himself, he could do it for a 10th of the price, but it's not a case of finding the better deal.  The NHS is locked into decade long (perhaps more in other depts.) buyer contracts with various companies.  The guy that started this subthread will be working for one of those companies.  Yeah - sure there is justifiable competition *within the contracted businesses*, but that barely means anything when you're spending 10x the amount for *item x* than you strictly need to, simply because you're not allowed to buy *item x* from anyone other than these predetermined businesses.  I'm not exaggerating either - he pulled up something he needed to buy from publicly accessible markets, and then he pulled up the same item from the list of places he was allowed to buy it from - the price difference was - upsetting.  As soon as I saw it, I realised that this is probably the case for every single thing the NHS buys - ever - which will effectively be making the NHS waste around 80-90% of its budget.  It must be said - I do understand the importance of having *trusted* businesses established when you're buying things for institutions like the NHS - but to use that mechanism as a device to make wild, and I do mean *wild* profit margins is not fine.

I also got a little taste of how the whole ""middle-management"" structure works as well.  I over-heard conversations between doctors about how pen-pushing box-ticking straight-out-of-management-school types just didn't understand how healthcare worked - and they were right.  Now, I'm not actually all in favour of doctors of medicine *running* the NHS.  It seems perhaps obvious that they should, but running an institution, and working as a doctor are quite different, and quite honestly I believe a lot of scientifically high-quality doctors could do with a healthy kick-up the arse regarding humanitarian requirements as opposed to injecting this and prodding that in order to keep something breathing.  That is perhaps too harsh, but my point is that there needs to be a balance between management influence and medical influence - and right now - there's *way* too much management.  The manager of my dept. seemed to spend most of her time in meetings about how the management structure was defined in the local area - as if anyone gave a fuck who was wearing the suit for the hospital they're currently getting surgery in.  There were staff meetings (involving peons like me) about which district now owned which hospital, or which 'patch' answered to which director... or what the fuck ever.  All I remember is I was getting the distinct impression that the management level had become dissected from what was commonly understood as ""The NHS"", and seemed to take on a life of its own - swimming around in it's bureaucratic aquarium, happy and comfortable with its established positions and titles and neat little brackets of sections of this and that.  All sharpened pencils lined up ion a row.

I should say, I did actually work in a fantastic hospital.  It provided great care and I (as a young man) was inspired to help as much as I could.  That said, I also worked in a community hospital, which as I understand is *much* different to ""main""(?) hospitals.  This is not a crack at the effects of this stuff on the patients, I'm not making wild conjectures about what the knock on effects of these events are - but - if my experience is anything to go buy, the NHS is contractually forced to rob itself blind, and the only people that might be in a position to do anything about it all seem to be hyper-jaded ""business types"", who swam from meeting to meeting, fill in forms, tick boxes, follow rules, and are generally so busy with everything else that they;re not actually doing anything at all.

So it strikes me the only real argument for independence is actually the cultural one... that if you honestly believe Scots culture is so constrained by being in a union with the English that the only way to really embrance ""being Scottish"" is to gain independence, then you should vote for it. Personally though I wouldn't so optimisitc about your future...

&gt;  I do want to celebrate who we are and what we are

I think an independent Scotland would be culturally reduced to little more than a pathetic pastiche of itself. A lot like Ireland, where the worlds impression of them is a carricature of Guiness and St Patricks day - a binge drinking festival that usually ends in sporadic violence. What are the Scots going to have? Ginger beards, wiskey and tartan...

At any rate, if you listen to Salmond you'd think independence was a panacea for all the ills of Scotland. It isn't and it won't be. I genuinely hope enough Scots realise that to vote no. Although now the seeds have been sowed I doubt we will ever hear the end of this. The SNP will just push referendum after referendum until they get what they want. It'll be like the neverendum's in Canada's seperatist Quebec.

One thing I would point out though, is if you think the 5 million people in Scotland with a fledgling government are going to dictate the terms of independence to the well established government in westminster, representing the other 55 million people - you are mistaken. If you vote for it, I've no doubt you'll get independence... as far as everything else goes, don't be so sure. The English might not be great partners, but it's better to have them on your side than as a competitive rival. For that reason I actually think independence would marginalise Scotland, economically and politically.",0,1366812491,null,0,false,0,c9lnlcz,t3_1cz0jq,t1_c9lnlcz,t1_c9lauec,null,1431445753,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But the very idea or the Cartmel Masterplan was to turn that around, and now we don't really know anything about The Doctor, for certain anymore, other than he is a madman in a box. We can't even be absolutely sure he's from Gallifrey, and only know he claims to be a Timelord - but even as River said, ""The Doctor lies."". We can't ultimately be sure of anything, unless we actually see it - and even then, history can be rewritten...

Mind you, I'm not at all saying The Doctor isn't a timelord from Gallifrey at all, I'm just saying there is nothing certain we can be sure of absolutely. That's why ""The Question"" is such a big thing. (And my guess is, it's only going to ask more questions than answer anything...)

The second part of this whole season has been The Doctor trying to figure out who Clara is, but it's a distraction from what WE should be asking, and should have been asking (and I believe Clara will begin asking very soon) since Trotter's Lane, London in 1963...

Trying to be rational, lets look at the pros and cons of this ban:

Pros-

He's become an unattractive transfer target to anyone in England (although I really don't think he'd move to a rival club in the BPL and he's still got 3 years left on his contract which he signed last summer.) 

Hopefully he'll learn his fucking lesson, I love Luis, despite all this, you cannot ignore the skill (and apparently he's a lovely guy off the pitch), but hopefully it means he'll learn that when he fails, the club fails. Because as a realist, Liverpool without Suarez turn from a mediocre team that can put in a great performance, to just a mediocre team. 

Cons-

10 GAMES? I think it's harsh (yadda yadda racism &lt; biting etc). In my head I was hoping 4 games, end of the season, start next season a new, but looks like the FA are playing hardball. This leads me on to...

How does this impact us next season, obviously game schedule hasn't been released yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if come the end of the first 6 games of the season, we'll have dropped points to either a mid-table club where he could've been the difference, or scraped a draw (or flat out lose) to a CL rival competitor, forcing us to play catch up in a top 4 charge (yadda yadda next year is our year, etc).

European clubs suddenly might be willing to alleviate us our troublesome striker (although we'd be mad to do so, no way could we replace him.)

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120629/07141319534/uks-3-strikes-plan-continues-to-grind-through-system-still-not-force-still-awful.shtml

The last legal challenges to the Digital Economy Act failed last year (the DEA is god fucking awful) so we are starting to see the actual ideas for the 3 strike plans they are planning to put in place in 2014 (I think).

One of the few ways you could appeal would be based on IP is not a person and that you didn't do it but currently that requires you to show you took reasonable steps to prevent infringement which is absurd. If you want to use the fact you open your network as to why it wasn't you who infringed on that network it seems like you'd be accused of not securing the network.

**edit**

I said
&gt;So it seems you'd under the current plans be held responsible in terms of strikes (which start with letters but may lead to sanctions after the US model) but I currently don't know if that would make you liable in a civil case of copyright infringement.    

&gt;In short you may be responsible for strikes on your network and have your access throttled or cut off but I don't think the content owners would then be able to sue you for it as well.

And that is wrong, strikes can be followed up with legal action. You can appeal the strikes based on the idea that an IP is not a person but given how that's currently being worded it seems hard. So it's likely you'd have to test the idea of liability for wifi in open court but given how the government is framing the ability to appeal the strike it seems like they'd want the same to stand in court    

**/edit**
 
The US is routinely holding up the idea that you are liable for an open network but no ones tested the 6 strike system on this point yet. Because their system is one based on voluntary agreement it works on the presumption of guilt and there is very little recourse because ISP don't have to provide you with service. My feeling is that we'll see open wifi shutting down or simply not bothering to fight bans as a result.

I'm rambling a bit but honestly we don't know and the DEA over here is a cluster fuck so honestly with the way things are going if you are not liable now you most likely will end up being so before long.

Also, from what I've read, Paraxel aren't off the hook yet. They seemed to have created a joint venture company which shielded the parent company from liability. It is this company which went under. 

Whether the link of liability to the parent company can be created depends purely on whether Paraxel knew what kind of procedures and risks the JV company Tegenero knew about. 

Effectively, all we know so far is that Paraxel stumped up the money for a completely independent operating company to carry out trials. It's investment was monetary, and it didn't know how the company was being operated (in terms of unsafe procedures, unknown risks). 

If talks are ongoing (which I believe they are) then lawyers may have found evidence to the contrary (i.e. that paraxel management knew about the risks). If that's the case then a court will happily join the liability dots, which is why I cna only hope Paraxel are entering into settlement talks if there's enough evidence to get them.

1) Demonstrable rule-breaking is a sign of bad character, regardless of what the rule is or how it is broken. Such a bad sign of character that an employer would be wise to act against it

2) This would only apply to low-skilled workers, as they're the ones who pose a threat to their own (and others) safety as they tend to operate heavy machinery.

The law surrounding drug testing in the workplace is foggy at best, if only because being under the influence of controlled substances isn't unlawful in itself. It is quite possible for someone to spend a lot of time with a cannabis smoker, and find they have inhaled enough for it to register in a drugs test. Similarly, someone can just as easily have been slipped a pill in a drink, and so on. Testing positive for trace amounts of a drug is obviously different to possessing it at the time. For this reason alone, it is unfair to draw a parallel between testing positive in a drug test, and having a negative character flaw.

As for heavy machinery, a risk assessment can only be based on someone's behaviour and sobriety at the time of operation. A risk assessment will ask if an operator is fit to use the machinery. If you are fit, but hold trace amounts of a controlled (or otherwise) substance, this cannot be held against you if the amount was low enough to not cause a reasonable expectation of impairment. With enough expensive machinery, any chemical could be found in anybody's body. This is why the likes of Airports and National Rail have particular dispensations in their by-laws that allow this, as it is certainly not a regular feature of workplace law.

If workplace testing was to become commonplace, all it would serve to do is make layoffs for management a lot, lot easier.

Complicating matters somewhat is that there are non-Jewish Spurs fans and Jewish people who don't support Spurs, but I would ask those people if they're more offended by opposition fans making gas chamber hissing sounds over a fairly tame self-defense mechanism.

He will have a big break, from now until mid September if we have no EL, he isn't a guy who needs breaks mid season, but in the long run it will help a lot as he will not getting break next summer.

He will probably get a lot of time to do solo practice and tune some aspects of his game (he has been doing freekick training and it has payed off, hopefully some shooting practice is next on list if our coaches have seen the number of shots he blasts over the goal from distance).

Sturridge can finally for the first time in how long have the striker position for himself, up to him to prove his worth and lead the line.

Lastly, he will have a lot of time to reflect, let's not forget how much he has changed, obviously he still has some issues, but on the pitch he looks a lot calmer and does less screaming/rolling around.

Temporarily withdrawing from the ECHR when it suits is a hideous idea and no sensible government should suggest such a policy. However withdrawing from it permenantly and insituting national legislation that protects our fundamental human rights could be a viable alternative.

A few points to consider...

I think it's more likely the FA took all of his disciplinary issues into consideration.  That is much more of a gray area.  I feel that if they took his ban at Ajax into consideration then they needed to do research into if that was the correct decision under the letter of the law.  It most likely was, but I doubt the FA looked into.

UKIP aren't racist. However I'd happily agree that many of their supporters are. People who are racist at heart but don't think they are will vote for a party that represents what they want but is still acceptable. That means Little Englanders will vote for UKIP.

However I don't think it's at all fair to suggest that because all oranges are fruits, all fruits are oranges, if that makes sense.

I'm dead bang in the middle of the libertarian right on the political compass. No party is even in that quadrant. The closest parties to me are UKIP and Libdems. I believe in personal freedom and a small state. I'm a classic liberal...

I'm also Eurosceptic because I think it's anti-democratic, statist, protectionist and inwards looking. 

I believe in reasonable immigration controls - but I recognise that immigration is overall beneficial for the country. At times I don't like either the Tory or UKIP tone about immigration. Sometimes I think they try to appease the Daily Mail too much. However I don't like what Labour did in the last decade with immigration where they conspired to mislead the public on it.

I think the EU contains countries which are economically very different and it's inevitable that people will try to find a better life for themselves. I don't like the right wing nastiness that is aimed them for it - why on earth wouldn't they? It's the human condition to try to better your life and your children's. The idea that these people should be resented for it is ludicrous. 

However I don't think it's the right thing for people to migrate to exist on the fringes of society for a better life. The difference between poor people in the UK and poor people in Romania is staggering, and it's understandable why people might come over here and be exploited on terrible wages rather than a worse position in their home country. Corruption is the enemy. At home, in the EU and especially in Central European countries. Over here it's behind the scenes, it's lobbies and it's directorships after government, but elsewhere it's flat out bribes, theft and thuggery. 

I don't consider myself to be racist. I do recognise that many people are racist and they'll vote for a party that suits their desires, and that may be the Tories, Labour or UKIP - whichever is banging the drum loudest at the time over immigration, but I don't think that makes those parties racist.

The BNP on the other hand have explicitly racist policies. That means anyone who votes for them is voting for a racist party.

true,shunt31,ni-tyrone,Tyrone,"Looks unlikely that they could derogate from the treaty.

&gt;Article 15 allows contracting states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the Convention in time of ""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"". Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:
&gt;
&gt;    1. There must be a **public emergency threatening the life of the nation**;
&gt;    2. Any measures taken in response must be ""strictly required by the exigencies of the situation"", and
&gt;    3. The measures taken in response to it, must be in compliance with a state's other obligations under international law
&gt;
&gt;In addition to these substantive requirements the derogation must be procedurally sound. There must be some formal announcement of the derogation and notice of the derogation, any measures adopted under it, and the ending of the derogation must be communicated to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
&gt;
&gt;The Court is quite permissive in accepting a state's derogations from the Convention but applies a higher degree of scrutiny in deciding whether measures taken by states under a derogation are, in the words of Article 15, ""strictly required by the exigencies of the situation"". Thus in A v United Kingdom, the Court dismissed a claim that a derogation lodged by the British government in response to the September 11 attacks was invalid, but went on to find that measures taken by the United Kingdom under that derogation were disproportionate.
&gt;
&gt;In order for a derogation itself to be valid, **the emergency giving rise to it must be**:
&gt;
&gt;    1. **Actual or imminent**, although states do not have to wait for disasters to strike before taking preventive measures,
&gt;    2. **Involve the whole nation**, although a threat confined to a particular region may be treated as ""threatening the life of the nation"" in that particular region,
&gt;    3. **Threaten the continuance of the organised life of the community**,
&gt;    4. Exceptional such that measures and restriction permitted by the Convention would be ""plainly inadequate"" to deal with the emergency.

true,victor_foxtrot,lfc99,,"Yeah, it doesn't make sense for **us**, sure.  But consider the following factors:

* After this incident, he's never going to get a fair shake from the neither the English press nor the referees ever again (not that he was to begin with.)  His behavior has obviously left a little to be desired, but if you were completely villified almost every day in your job, wouldn't you want to leave?
* He's one of the top 10 players in the world in his prime, and wants and deserves to play in the Champions League.  Unfortunately, LFC can't provide that right now but there are a lot of potentially interested parties who can.  Again, look at it from Suarez's perspective.  Would you rather play alongside Stewart Downing in an environment where you're hated for 120k/week, or for (arguably) the biggest club in the world alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, in the Champions League, for probably 160k-180k/week?  Sadly for us, it's no contest.
* A sale might not even be the worst thing for LFC.  No one here would deny that the squad is pretty shallow right now - would we be better off with one 50m player or four 12m players?  This isn't the NBA where one superstar completely drives your team.  Look at the players Newcastle was able to bring in with the Carroll funds.
* FSG is probably getting tired of this shit.  I live in Boston and can probably speak more intelligently about what FSG are truly like than 95% of the people in this subreddit, because they've owned the biggest franchise in the area for a dozen years.  FSG are **extremely** image-conscious.  The racism row with Evra was one thing (and I still think he was innocent of that), but this incident isn't going to fly with them, especially since he has a history.  I wouldn't be surprised if Standard Chartered and/or Warrior are getting a little pissed too - SC certainly wasn't psyched about the Evra incident.  Now I'm not saying they SHOULD have any influence on what ultimately happens here, but the reality is they probably have some.

That's not the assumption. What is known is that a woman can probably have children, is at the approximate age where them having children is likely, and that it would be crippling to the business, and so that that risk can not be taken. There's nothing hateful towards women in that, it's just biology mixed with a few silly laws, and a natural and intelligent reaction towards those laws by business owners.

&gt;Source - I am one. And I have no intention of having kids. Why is it right that no one would employ me based purely on my age and gender?

What do you mean ""right""? Right for whom? It's right for the business because they aren't legally allowed to ask if you intend on having children, and so don't know if you're an expensive liability waiting to happen or not. Hence you'll probably get passed up on for certain jobs.

Blame the government for coming up with paid maternity leave and making it illegal to ask if someone intends on having children.

Honestly, bottom line is they can always just say they judged you to be inferior to properly old/young women, or men, and the vast majority of times they're going to get away with it.

Social mobility in the UK, and elsewhere, largely depends upon education.  Equality in access to higher education (i.e. university) is a relatively new phenomenon in the UK, and something we only began to have in any real sense in the late nineties. Before then, people from working class families rarely went to university and, therefore, the higher paid jobs were closed to them.  The people shown in the Up series were born in the sixties, much too early to take advantage of the new trends in higher education.

Social attitudes also have to be taken into account.  In the UK, people are teased for being upwardly mobile.  They are not discouraged as such, but there are vast swathes of the population who feel that being working class is ""more real"", and will tease those they know who are.  I constantly tease my middle class friends about things like having as many cars as people in their household, having a special cupboard just for bread, and buying fancy supermarket brands.  Therefore, those who are upwardly mobile are unlikely to make a big deal about it for fear of being seen as showing off - especially if they're appearing on telly.

Again, as Tomkins states:

&gt;'Suarez has been singled out for who he is, rather than the crime he committed.'

[I mentioned the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1cvfah/fa_statement_on_luis_suarez_charged_with_violent/c9kcl59) that I wouldn't be surprised if Suarez was banned for 10 games.

The league and Champions League are interchangeable in terms of priority and reputation. Some seasons a club will be desperate to win the league back (see United this year), some the CL will take over (Liverpool 2005, us last year). The Champions League is the biggest trophy in European football, it's the European Super Bowl, if that helps.

The FA Cup is the main domestic knockout completion and usually third on a team's list of priorities. The Community Shield is a one off friendly/exhibition played in August between the previous season's league winners and FA Cup winners. The Football League trophy is the second domestic cup competition. The Europa League is like a diluted Champions League for European teams that haven't qualified for it. You either play in the Europa or the Champions League, you can't play in both at the same time.

If I were to order them it would go: 
Champions League/domestic league
FA Cup
League Cup

true,my-j,null,null,"I take your point, but is the objective of the legislation to create many small domestic banks, or is the purpose to protect depositors by preventing retail banks from getting involved in too risky ventures/trading  which is the domain of investment banking.


My understanding is that you are arguing against legislation because it will create small banks.   (maybe we are debating  different things).  I am of the opinion that the purpose of the legislation is not to create small banks but to limit their activities to the retail market.

I firmly believe that retail banks should stick to retail function and not get involved in investment banking.   If foreign banks  decide to participate in the UK market they will also be limited to the retail banking model.   They will face the same barriers.

I agree and think that too many small banks would not exist for long - consolidation or they would be bought out.     But again legislation is needed to prevent monopoly.    
Four or five big retail banks is healthier then  having one group  dominating the retail market.   

The retail banking model is not as glamorous as the investment model. and  competing in the retail market requires huge investment into brick and mortar.   Or they could buy an existing bank.   But  I dont think that we can ban foreign competition.

true,victor_foxtrot,lfc99,,"&gt; I think all Suarez has ever cared about is the fans of the team he plays for. He knows the boos from the opposition means he's doing his job and he quite frankly thrives off it. 

Agree with you there.  The guy obviously cares what he's making, but he does seem to care more about the fans than your average footballer.  And he quite clearly loves to get booed by opposing fans, which is a great trait to have.

&gt; Also look where Newcastle are now, not exactly where we want to be

True story.  I was just referring to how we'd still be able to bring in talent if Suarez does go.  For example, NUFC was able to bring in Tiote, Ben Arfa, Cabaye, Santon, Cisse, and Debuchy for 35.5m.  Yes, we overpaid for Carroll.  No, Carroll isn't nearly as good as Suarez.  But if the rumors of a 20m net spend this summer are to be believed, you could probably bring in some pretty nice talent for that plus Suarez proceeds.

&gt; As for FSG wanting to keep their ""image"", I wouldn't want to think about what images we'd see if they force Suarez out. It could turn into a riot if it was FSG's doing, American owners don't bode well here as it is. 

People would be pissed, yeah.  Here in Boston they shipped out a malcontent franchise icon in our equivalent of the January window - shocked the city, people were irate, and they only brought in spare parts.  But those spare parts addressed the team's most glaring need at the time (defense), and 3 months later we won our first title in 86 years.  FSG isn't afraid to piss off the customers to make what they feel is the right long-term call.  And frankly?  Anfield will be packed next season and for the 20 after that, the shirts will sell, etc etc, no matter if Suarez is here or not.  I'm not trying to side with FSG/SC/Warrior, but that is the reality of things.

&gt; I hate saying this since it happens every year, but next year will be our year. We won't win the league but we should be top 4

Have to say I agree with you.  Put it this way:
* We're in the first year under a new manager
* Our two most significant summer acquisitions were hurt all year
* Our first half would probably have been a little better if not for l'affaire Dempsey
* By and large we'd all say the team underachieved all year

And despite ALL that - if Suarez's winner at Goodison isn't wrongly ruled out, if Skrtel doesn't make that insane back pass, and Pepe doesn't lose his mind + Aguero hits a 1-in-1,000 shot - we're only 5 points out of the top 4 right now.  Have the team not totally shit the bed in the 2nd half at the Emirates and it's only a 2 point gap.  We're close, closer than is commonly believed.

My personal phone is on Three, and their coverage is very good and their data speeds are nice and fast.  Their customer service isn't known for being brilliant but to be fair the last time I spoke to them was when I ported my old number upon starting my contract, around a year ago.  This was a very painless experience, and I've not needed to ever speak to them since, I don't think.  Oh, that's a lie. I had to get a Nano-SIM when I bought myself an iPhone 5.  I walked into a Three Store, asked for one, they took my mobile number, gave me a SIM (along with adaptors to fit it in Micro and ""Normal"" SIM slots) for free, and told me that within a couple of hours the old SIM would stop working and the new one would start.  Surely enough, when I got home, the old SIM stopped working, so I put the new one in and it worked.  They're an excellent network overall and probably my favourite.


O2's customer service is reportedly the best, but their network is so shoddy that it's probably necessary that this is the case ;)

SAS are extremely elite; their reputation is earned and the US Military looks upon them as some of the best soldiers in the world.

That being said.

Force Recon Marines are a joke in the US Special Operations community. There's a reason that they aren't use that much by USSOCOM officials: they're usually a bunch of jarheads who happen to have a lot of physical training. When it comes down to it, Rangers are more likely to be sent instead of FR Marines. Mostly, FR Marines are used entirely by the Marine Corps.

I read an article several years ago where several special operation soldiers from the anglophone world were interviewed. The SAS soldier (operator?) said that the SAS refused to work with anyone but Delta Force or DEVGRU. They didn't believe anyone was well trained and experienced enough to keep up.

Delta Force operators are usually selected from Ranger Battalions. Their training is brutal, even by SAS standards. There have been times when no one made it passed selection and therefore no new Delta operators were available.

DEVGRU operators are definitely on the same level as SAS. One of the original operators wrote a book and said that them and Delta Force would usually have shooting contests. Delta Force would train for weeks, while DEVGRU usually sent hungover operators that would always out-shoot Delta.

DEVGRU selects their people entirely out of SEAL teams. SEALs are already highly trained, and DEVGRU selection weeds out weak SEALs and also helps their shooting.

Delta, SAS and DEVGRU all cross train often. They know that each one has something new to teach and something new to learn. They also know that they could all find themselves in the same spot at the same time, and need to know that the person next to them know their stuff.

Basically, a fight between a DEVGRU operator and an SAS soldier would either be a stalemate or a fight to both of their deaths.",0,1366829043,null,0,false,0,c9ltlmf,t3_19t6cq,t1_c9ltlmf,t1_c8r59ci,null,1431442921,5,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,5

true,cdm9002,null,null,"As a fellow Brit in the US I've thought of this. A lot depends if you are a legal resident or just on a work visa, and if you have a US bank account.

- UK person will have to convert GBP to USD and then wire it over to you, or put GBP into your UK account and then you'll do the exchange. Be aware of fees and exchange rate loss. Calculate and communicate the fixed fees and estimate of the rate using a known transfer site, e.g. transferwise or xe.com.

- Escrow, is going to be difficult because of being cross border. It would have to be people who you trust and trust you.

If you are a legal resident:

- Any income over $5k entering your US bank account from abroad will be flagged for potential investigation.

- You will incur a tax liability as it will be considered income. Depending on your employment status, and amount (over $400/yr) it will be seen as self-employed income and will have to be reported on tax forms accordingly. However, it can be written off as part of your self-employed business (are you taking a cut?) but you might still get hit with other states taxes on the gross income.

- you could then send it to your verified MtGox account and buy the coins, transfer them back. The whole process is going to take 3-4 days for UK-&gt;US transfer, 3-4 days for US-&gt;MtGox (cheapest method, or 1-2 for wire) or coinbase, then up to a day for MtGox processing.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;This is England not some banana republic dictatorship. 

Exactly. And this is why we have human rights. Your free to go and live in some shitty dictatorship with no rights but we decided back 1215 that that wasn't going to be here. You've been wrong for 800 years.

&gt;What if court decides a person is innocent and lets the person walk free and then he kills a innocent person. Then what? 

Right, so fuck court systems altogether. Your saying that because we can't quite be totally infallible we may as well not bother with having trials and a right to persuade people your innocent? That's like saying your not going to live forever so you may as well kill yourself now. Such unbelievably faulty logic. 

&gt;You are so blind in the probability that courts never make mistakes

You are so blind in the probability that the government never makes mistakes. The courts are not trying to please anyone, all they have in mind is applying the law as it stands. Unless you are utterly uninformed about politics, you'll know not a single year goes by without a politician lying, cheating or making a huge mistake. I would never trust them with the entire justice system in a million years. In fact the situation you want is exactly the position in the 'banana republic dictatorship[s]' you talk about. Why, you might ask, was Stalin able to imprison so many people unjustly? It was because there was no independent judiciary to oppose him and if they did he could use the police to unite the government's view with the judges' view. A dictatorship is, by definition, what happens when you abolish rights and hand governments the reigns of justice. Furthermore, who are you to say the judges made a mistake. By all means show me the legal precedent that shows they were wrong. They are not judging these cases on emotion but on law alone. 

&gt;Your fear of goverment plays right into the hands of criminals and terrorists.

No. Your embrace of the destruction of your own power and your own rights is what plays into the hands of terrorists. What happened after 9/11? Before 9/11 3000 people were alive who were not afterwards. If we left it at that it would have been the terrorists' only effect. Instead the US now feels it is allowed to assassinate anyone in the world without a trial, Britain has decided you aren't allowed to have the right to free speech, fair trial or right not to be tortured etc etc you previously enjoyed and nor am I. 

By trying to protect ourselves from a threat that makes lighting strikes look common, terrorists have not just effected 3000 people but millions and millions more and were doing it to ourselves! And now *your* suggesting that we make our lives even more shitty because of terrorists? No, fuck you. I'm going to live with all the rights I like because I'm not a deluded murderer in an imaginary holy war. I'm going to keep the rights *you* want to take from me precisely because I live in England and not in dictatorship. 

I don't give a solitary shit what happens to Abu Qatada but I'm not going to let terrified, totalitarian people like you take my rights away on behalf of him. I bet he'd love it if he could get away with not only costing us a tonne of money but also costing us our right to life, our right to free assembly, our right to free thought and conscience or our right not to be discriminated against etc etc. He'd love it! And the most idiotic part of it all would be he would watch us tear apart the rights that set us apart from the shittier parts of the world from the inside of a prison cell where he is completely neutralised as whatever threat he was. He's currently powerless to do anything and in the meantime your suggesting we dismantle our constitution is stop him.

true,MisterPhD,null,null,"&gt;All the Doctor managed to alter was the details of the fixed point. 

History is in the details, though.  There's a huge difference between no one knowing why the base on Mars exploded and three of the crew mysteriously showing up back on Earth, two of whom live.  

&gt;The Doctor didn't CAUSE the event.

I'm not necessarily saying he did.  This is a theory that I just saw, and kinda like, so I'll try and defend it.  The Doctor may not have caused the event, but he played his part in it.  He gave the crew information that they wouldn't have normally had, and changed how quickly/well they were able to react to the strange situations.  

I had this quote somewhere in my last post, so I'll put it in this one too.  The Doctor explains fixed points in time to the Captain at 29:34, prefacing it with 'this is only a theory', just like he did in the Impossible Planet/Satan Pit when he wasn't sure.

**""**This moment, this precise moment in time, is like...  I mean, it's only a theory, what do I know. But...  I think, certain moments in time, are fixed.  Tiny, precious moments.  Everything else is in flux, anything can happen.  But those certain moments, they HAVE to stand.  This base, on Mars, with you, Adelaide Brooke.  This is one vital moment.  What happens here, must always happen.**""**

Except, it didn't happen.  It became that base, on Mars, with only those infected with the Mars Virus.  And now, since he played his part, it's a fixed moment in time.  He can't go back and change any of those details, cause it would be crossing his own timeline.

Going back to the Pompeii example, later in the same episode, he references it.  I'm starting earlier than I need to, cause the music + Tennant acting = bliss.  Anyway, at 39:26, here's what's said:

**""**Imagine...  Imagine you knew something... Imagine you found yourself somewhere... I don't know, Pompeii.  Imagine you were in Pompeii.**""**  ""What the hell has that got to do with it?""  **""**And you tried to save them, but in doing so, you make it happen... Anything I do, just makes it happen.**""**

So while he may not have caused the explosion, he knows it's a fixed point in time.  Maybe the reason it's a fixed point in time is because back when the Time Lords were around, they deemed it so, cause with that moment, the human race moved to colonize in space (and the Daleks, even with their need to exterminate all living things, recognize that it's a vital part in the universe's history), which is the reason he gives at ~32:40

**""**That's how you create history.  Imagine it, Adelaide.  If you began a journey that takes the human race all the way to the stars.  It begins with you.  And then your granddaughter, you inspire her, so that in 30 years, Susie Fontana Brooke, is the pilot of the first light speed ship...**""**


Like I said, playing devil's advocate cause I like the idea, and I'm only using examples from Water of Mars, cause you mentioned the episode, and I was lucky enough that it had relevant quotes that I could use.

And you are right, its something that has always bugged me about the show: we see little snippets of the future in each episode that can have dramatic effects on how the universe works but we rarely see how they effect each other. 
Its interesting, because at one point, we are led to believe that the question, being ""Doctor Who?"" will be answered, as evidenced in the library the first time the Doctor meets River in his timeline, (the last in River's) she tells him something to make him trust her completely. i do believe the Doctor explains that she told him something that he can only tell the person he marries on his wedding day. upon further thought, I realized that as of now, the Doctor and River aren't married. River had the ceremony with a Tesselecta of the Doctor, and he never told her anything. 
The season finale, according to Moffat is a really big shock, where we learn something about the Doctor we have never known before. (im paraphrasing) I believe that we will see the actual marriage of the Doctor to River coming shortly. This is where we *perhaps* will learn the Doctor's name, which may be connected to the Last Great Time War.
Of course this may not be his *real* name, just another name similar to ""The Doctor"", which holds significance, but isn't his *given name* if you will. Either one of those names may unlock whatever is behind the ""Timey Wimey Curtain"". 
We know now that both Jenna Louise-Coleman (Jenna-Louise?) and Matt Smith are both signed for season 8, where the real shit, mayhaps another Great Time War or something on a scale such as that where Clara will be forced to make some sort of a choice. i really havnt given season 8 *that* much thought yet.

true,Chasmosaur,tardis,TARDIS,"You summed up the way I feel about the three of them.

Tennant obviously had a boat-load of fun with the role, but I never bought his ""I'm so sorry"". (The only time I really loved him was in ""The Family of Blood"" when he was railing against leaving the John Smith persona, and then how he came back to Joan Redfern so subtly malicious. He was awesome with that.)  He was good, but his schtick wore thin to me after a while.

I think Matt Smith was a brilliant choice visually.  With his unusual facial features and lanky frame, he is White and Nerdy, but he's also a bit other-worldly.  I think he's doing a better job than Tennant, but I get a little weary of the low-voiced menace thing.  If I've loved any character during his time, it's been Rory (and not just because I find Arthur Darvill yummy ;) ).  Rory was far more interesting - a great mix of strength, vulnerability and perception.

Eccleston - even with the lack of good material and the fact I'm not the biggest fan of Rose - I think is more compulsively watchable as Nine. It's because you never quite knew what his reaction was going to be week to week.  You could never have foreseen his joy in The Doctor Dances based on what you'd seen in previous episodes. And I think that joy seemed to infect the character going forward - it mellowed and softened him for his last few episodes.  I don't see that much of progression of either Tennant's or Smith's doctors.

Eccleston saw a character, and applied his prodigious acting chops to it.  Tennant and Smith seem to be applying personas instead - there's a subtle difference, but I think it shows.",0,1366836057,null,0,false,0,c9lwh8y,t3_1czzdx,t1_c9lwh8y,t1_c9lr7vz,null,1431441494,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

What I'm saying is that it DID happen. The base was still created, the base still exploded, and Adelaide still died. The only difference is where she died. The events DIDN'T occur. And this theory is that ""The Doctor caused the events and that is why they are fixed."" If that is the theory, then it's markedly wrong in this case. if you change the theory to ""The Doctor observing things makes them fixed"" then almost all of history is fixed, but that's not really true, because we've seen things make history change (time collapsing, etc). 

&gt;So while he may not have caused the explosion, he knows it's a fixed point in time. Maybe the reason it's a fixed point in time is because back when the Time Lords were around, they deemed it so, cause with that moment, the human race moved to colonize in space (and the Daleks, even with their need to exterminate all living things, recognize that it's a vital part in the universe's history), which is the reason he gives at ~32:40

Irredentism requires two (or possibly more) separate states, there is only one state in the situation at hand.

&gt;*The Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland ceased to exist in 1707, and were superseded by the UK. Wales, as a part of the Kingdom of England at the time of unification, became a part of the UK thereafter, and remains so today. It is a part of the UK, not of England* //

OK, I erred slightly, in saying ""which of *her* 3 kingdoms"" [emphasis added] instead I should have said which of the 3 kingdoms that were united in the UK was Wales?

So, the lands we now call Wales, fully annexed (as Cornwall say or any other region), were a part of England and so entered the UK in the treaty joining Scotland and England to form the UK. But now you're saying that Wales isn't a part of that kingdom any longer that it has somehow been de-annexed? What law was passed then to make this new Wales (which never before existed as a state in that form) a part of the UK?

&gt;*then I don't know what will* //

You can't end annexation. 

Even if you could you wouldn't end up with the area we now call Wales.

Perhaps a new state of Wales has been created and I missed it but there is no ""Wales established in $year by Act of Parliament"" that anyone's pointed me to nor that I've seen in passing but, like I said I've not studied the recent (last 20 years or so) changes.",0,1366839911,null,0,false,0,c9ly26r,t3_1cpfud,t1_c9ly26r,t1_c9lduv1,null,1431440749,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1

Or, since Time isn't linear, and instead is wibbly-wobbly, it was a fixed point because the Doctor already went there and tried to stop it, but failed. 


I honestly think Adelaide could have lived, though.  Like he said, she would just be there in person to tell her granddaughter the story herself. I think that she killed herself to spite the Victorious Timelord, or as a less cynical thought, to reign in someone who was ready to forge on and change the whole of history.

Maybe because he was told by the council that fixed points are points in time that need to happen, in this case cause it lays the groundwork for humans to colonize space.  It would be a theory because he doesn't understand it completely, just like his theory that nothing came before the universe, yet there was the Beast in the Pit who says different. 

&gt;why would the Doctor refer to the concept of fixed points as a theory?

Because he said Pompeii was a fixed moment in time, yet he found himself there, with a choice.  He had the choice of letting the Pyrovile take over the world, or letting the mountain erupt.  Obviously, you wouldn't let the baddies take over the world, but he did have a choice.  He could have stopped the mountain from erupting.  That fact makes his idea of a fixed point into only a theory, one that he doesn't understand completely.


I ramble a little bit in this post, and address things in a weird order, so I'm sorry if some of it's confusing.  Like I said, I'm not saying this is fact, just a theory that I like and am trying to defend.  I agree with you that I think fixed points are points that need to happen, as I let slip through in the very first thing I reply to in this post.  But, I went back and tried to explain it in terms of the theory.  In truth though, we don't know exactly what fixed points are, because fixed points are whatever the show runner says they are, and any show runner that puts fixed points into defined terms has the responsibility to make sure that every episode regarding fixed points follows those rules.  It's better for them to just have it as a vague thing, and call it a fixed point when they just don't want to address the possibility of accidentally changing something important.",0,1366840675,null,0,false,0,c9lyd11,t3_1d0kgw,t1_c9lyd11,t1_c9lwt92,null,1431440607,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Trying to move up the social ladder is seen as trying too hard; see Hyacinth Bucket (Bouquet) or even all of the media articles about Carol Middleton trying to move up the social ladder when Kate and Wills married. It's almost better to be *lower* down the social scale in some ways (though never TOO low) because then you're more 'real'.",0,1366841249,null,0,false,0,c9lykxn,t3_1d0i6b,t1_c9lykxn,t1_c9ls4sa,null,1431440503,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

Qatada is clearly taking advantage of the way our system work but our system works that way for a reason, as a protection. We just really have to accept that crap like this happens from time to time because if we bend the rules or break them or bypass them the rules become meaningless.

If the government thinks the law isn't working then they should work to change it by the process we have in place to do so. You can't just pick and choose with this stuff and it's frightening to me that the government could side step that process in anyway to set aside laws they otherwise want to keep the same for an individual they don't like. 

We already have a system in place that will hold them demotractilly accountable for their actions. Allowing them to say ""but it's just for this one bad guy this one time"" is allowing them to sidestep that responsibility to the law by both getting exactly what they want without having to face a black lash for changing the rules for everyone else. 

We have justice, not revenge, and we have courts and judges so people are sentenced by none involved, independent parties. Allowing what would be, boiled down, a public vote on which laws apply to people whom the public may has reason to hate (a terrorist bomber say) and are throwing that idea out of the window. It would no longer be a justice system. I'm not saying the public would be a party to that over all but it the very idea undermines the whole point of the system.

itself*: Premier League, at paras 168-173, Infopaq II, at para 42. The

In other words the use, even if unauthorised, is lawful because it's an act that isn't restricted by copyright, which is true because it's covered by the temporary copying exception, which applies because it's lawful use. Circular logic, gotta love it.

Im pro vaccine and my daughter is fully protected.

I remember when the whole thing came out, and the national media gave that nutjob so much press attention and public forum that it became ingrained in the British psyche the MMR=Bad. 

Measles wasn't as visible or as prolific during this time so Autism seemed like the greater risk. I imagine hundreds if not thousands of parents have wrestled with their fears of should-we-shouldn't-we when the kids hit their 1st birthday. It's not down to neglect. Just a bad decision. 

The good news is, that since this outbreak, there have been thousands of children whose parents have seen sense and vaccinated. 1,600 children were vaccinated last Saturday in my LHB area. 

Hardly a case of widespread child negligence. Just misguided concern and fear.

I'm lucky enough to live near Glasgow and the contemporary live music scene is recognised as being amongst the best in the UK and I can enjoy this facet of our culture regularly. There are summer music festivals all over Scotland in recent years celebrating home-grown and international talent. We have lively annual jazz, film and comedy festivals in Glasgow but they're largely overshadowed by Edinburgh's International Arts festival which is the largest in the world - IN THE WORLD! We have literary festivals, not as big as Hay-on-Wye's but popular none-the-less. There's national theatre, opera and ballet too if music, film, comedy or books aren't your thing. I was at the theatre last Friday enjoying modern and traditional Scottish music and story telling. 
If you want to endulge in traditional culture it's there - World Pipe Band Championships, The Mod (Gaelic cultural celebration) and Celtic Connections would be the largest all attracting attention from home and abroad. Celtic Connections brings together traditional and modern folk musicians from the whole world and really is a remarkable and enjoyable experience.

Use of the term ""strawman argument"" seems to indicate that /u/DundonianStalin isn't interested in hearing why one might want to target shoot, he's only waiting to make a judgement about the rightness (or social acceptability, or whatever) of target shooting.

Perhaps you've got to the heart of the matter, that ""feel the need"" makes an assumption of unnecessary harm. I don't think any target shooter, or anyone who wants to own legal firearm and who engages in internet debate on the subject, wants to harm anyone.

""A strawman argument"" indicates the matter is up for debate, but it's not a matter of debate if someone tells you they might enjoy target shooting - it's a statement of fact.

The only person comparing *the regulation* of guns to that of pinball machines or guitars is you. I compared an *interest* in guns to that of pinball machines or guitars.

I think perhaps stamp collecting or steam trains might be a better comparison, because I genuinely do find it impossible to relate to those interests. I find those hobbies ""irrational"", but I don't go around patronisingly asking ""why on earth do you feel the need?"". Just writing that makes me feel like I've turned into my father. 

You seem to be conflating your fear of gun crime with my interest in target shooting. The two things have no relationship at all.

I don't really care about the legalisation of guns, but I recognise that they have a potential harm to society - through thefts or if a legal owner goes nuts. But that is totally different and separate from why I might enjoy target shooting.

If you're really curious, and ""trying to understand the other side of the debate"" then I think you need to be a bit more open-minded. I'm sorry if that sounds like a criticism - I know none of us like to think we're not open-minded. But I just can't interpret what you're saying - I don't understand how you can't understand that other people might enjoy different hobbies to you.

Saying ""it's not in the nature of people in this country"" sounds particularly critical - like you're comparing anyone who might have an interest in target shooting to some kind of toothless wild-haired hillbilly.

I'd say proper positioning is probably the best advice for any new rider. If you position yourself aggressively in your lane, owning the space around you car drivers tend to behave themselves for the most part. This means staying just right of the centre line* (of your lane) usually.

Also, look through the cars ahead of you, you will be able to anticipate problems far better. Look for things like odd positioning and brake lights. This will give you a heads-up on what is about to happen.

One point, one question:

Point:

&gt;  I don't think any target shooter, or anyone who wants to own legal firearm and who engages in internet debate on the subject, wants to harm anyone.

I think that's the problem 'guns rights advocates' have.  Their internal monologue goes, ""I'm smart and safe, my friends are smart and safe, so I think most people are"".

The thing is that's not good enough when it comes to guns.  Think of any run ins you've had with dangerous, intoxicated, emotionally unstable people.

I'm glad that when my drunk neighbour is banging on my door complaining about the loud noises, when he's actually probably hallucinating or got the wrong house, he doesn't have easy access to firearms.

Question:  How about if the government allowed pistol shooting but you have to do it at a target range, at a licensed venue, you leave your gun there, and it's stored in a lock-up.  Would you be happy with that?

You should be if you just want to do pigeon/target shooting.  You get to do what you want and the risk of use of firearms on others has been minimalised.

At one point States were very fearful of the success of proponents of anarchism in selling the project, although such fears have receded as its popularity has waned since the turn of the 20th century.  Anarchism has been gaining in popularity again since the sixties though, and we're starting to see active propaganda against it again, as well as co-option from the right.

As for whether anarchist societies would consist of ""small, self-governing settlements"" or would devolve into chaos and disorder, I'd say not necessarily in either case.  There's no need for anarchist communities to be small, although it's easier to conceive of them that way.  For example, syndicalism is one method by which larger, industrial and post-industrial anarchist societies could be structured.  Historical large scale examples have also survived for years at a time, and have only been destroyed by deliberate action by external forces (e.g. anarchist Catalonia).  Smaller scale examples have existed for far longer without chaos or disorder ensuing, and ultimately, a large proportion of most people's day to day activities are conducted along anarchist lines without any significant problems.  People are still kept very fearful and infantilised by State powers though, because they are easier to manage and milk that way, so it'd most likely take decades to undo the damage which has been done in public schools, the workplace, through media, literature, other aspects of culture etc..",0,1366848209,null,0,false,0,c9m12z4,t3_1czu7d,t1_c9m12z4,t1_c9lq3zp,null,1431439324,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

What I mean is... when people set up a new trade treaty, or international agreement, or when new technologies are jointly developed by countries - your first port-of-call aint The Republic of Ireland. But you might just get onto The UK, France, Germany etc. - Major economies and global players that can raise the finance needed to get things off the ground. Not to mention having access to a global city like London (despite all the evils that London does to the rest of the country, we all have to accept the majority of our wealth is generated there - and that isn't going to change just because theres a blue and white flag over Edinburgh)... if anything you might see the economic policies coming out of the City of London being even more fiscally aggressive, since they don't need to 'hold back' for the sake of Edinburgh or Glasgow.

Don't forget - the reason Scotland ended up in a union with England was because they couldn't raise enough capital to fund their Darien Scheme in the 1690s... so funded it themselves with 25% of their national wealth. Inevitably when it all went tits-up 10 years later the effect of having over-stretched their capital power was to bankrupt the wealthy Scottish land owners - and by extension their nation. When Scotland joined the union in 1707 the rest of the UK was able to write off their loses thanks largely to the fact it's population was 11 times larger than Scotlands, and could absorb the hit. Its rather like Cyprus or Icecland with their oversized banking sectors - perfect modern day examples of why being a small nation is constraining.

&gt; My desire for independence is about our ability to determine our own future, to set our own priorities and make Scotland a fairer society and more prosperous nation

Personally I think Scotland does determine its own future and can continue to do that through devolution. I don't see how independence would really further that except in a few niche areas of little importance to peoples lives. In many respects, the potential economic and political isolation that could follow might actually see Scots ability to influence their own future diminished.

If it boils down to two wars that have now finished, which nobody in England wanted either, or Trident, a single controversial issue - I'd hardly say it justifies the risks of independence.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; At the ballot box Scotland's votes have not influenced the chosen party of a UK election since before 1945

I hear this a lot, and it simply isn't true. Take the most recent election as an excellent example. By not voting Tory the Scots, along with other parts of the UK prevented an outright tory majority... something they didn't want. Not getting what you voted for is not the same as not influencing the outcome. When was the last time Wales determined the outcome of an election? Or Northern Ireland? - what about Cornwall or East Anglia? Should they all vote for independence?

The issue of inevitably being a junior partner simply by virtue of being  about one 10th the size of the rest of the UK is a tricky one. I can see the allure of having a government locally that supposedly does precisely what Scots want... but I'm not sure that will actually be the outcome. The other 55 million people to the South aren't going to kick back and let Scotland get on with it. They are going to continue to throw their economic weight around... they did it in the 1600s before union and they'll do it again. It's inevitable. Just like Germany dictates to Greece and Cyprus. At least now you get a say in it. You can't help the fact Scotland is a small nation with limited punching-power. Being independent isn't going to change that - if anything its going to expose it because you won't have the economic or political backbone of the UK - and in particular access to the major financial centres in London.

true,jpwasson,1905,Eiður Guðjohnsen,"I think Pellegrini would be a great choice for us. He had incredible success with Real until he was basically forced out. He brought in Ronaldo, Alonso, Benzema (I think) and Kaká. (who was unfortunately a bust) His cup games were very underwhelming but he got a record 96 points that year in the league. Unfortunately this was while Barça was basically unstoppable and he still lost the league to them by three points. 

I love what he has done with Malaga. Finishing fourth last year and then qualifying them for the CL for the first time in their history I believe, and leading them to the quarterfinals. (And let's be honest, they should be in the semis, not BVB) The financial uncertainty at Malaga has surely had an effect on the team this year yet they are still in 6th and only 3 points out of CL qualification.

So based on his history I think he would be a fantastic replacement given the never ending funds he would have and financial security he would be given by moving to CFC. The key would be to give him time to make his impression on the squad and get them playing the way he wants. 

Another key factor in my mind that I think makes Pellegrini an attractive option is the possibility of us not qualifying for the CL this year. If, God forbid, we don't qualify then our list of prospective managers is drastically shortened. Mou would more than likely not bother coming back. I think Pellegrini would come without qualification and he would probably be our best choice.

true,strolls,null,null,"I'd better start by saying that I'm not a guns right advocate - I'm possibly just a ""rights advocate"" or probably more of just an internet arguer.

I only jumped into this thread because of /u/DundonianStalin's use of the question ""why do you feel the need?"" - I only ever seem to see that in gun control arguments, and I think you've explained why. 

I don't very much like the government telling me what to do, or assuming the worst of me. On the other hand, I'm a great believer in planning for the worst, so I can understand your point of view.

I'd like to practice target shooting, but I guess I'm just lazy - my interest is rifles, which are legal, anyway. I thought about shooting air-rifles to start with, then never got around to it.

I can *particularly* understand what you say about assholes and people with temper problems - I think the scary thing is how much like ordinary law-abiding citizens they can seem. I'm just imagining some of the people from this subreddit who like to spew profanities and insults at the least excuse - I can only guess you probably wouldn't imagine it from meeting them. I think that when the gun debate was posted here a couple of months ago I saw some apparently very sensible people admit to having temper problems - and not trusting themselves with guns, I think - which really surprised me. 

I probably fall squarely into the category of ""I'm smart and safe, so I don't care about anyone else"", so I'd probably rather not venture a response to your question about handguns and locking them up at the range. I can see your argument, but it seems kinda odd to own something but not be able to keep it in your house. I'd probably personally just rather do without, myself.

There are some really good replies to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1czu7d/uk_becoming_a_more_peaceful_place/c9ll548) which talk about gun crime and culture. I don't tend to think about crime very much, and I don't tend to fear it, so I just can't relate to statements like ""the Swiss gun crime rate is 10 times ours, 1 in every 2000 deaths"". I reckon I probably have 100 times higher risk of dying of cancer -  at least 1 in 20 I'd guess - so 1 in 2000 seems like a pretty acceptable risk, to me.

When you compare gun crime and homicide rates between different countries it seems really common to see these kinds of juxtapositions - we don't have guns, but we have a higher homicide rate. If you look at USA, Sweden and Switzerland, they have similar accessibility to firearms with radically different results - I've never been able to make a useful correlation from such national comparisons. I really sympathise with the comments about ""come to Middlesborough, mate, and see if you want the louts to have guns"".

I suspect that the UK is most remarkable for its low gun crime rate (or it's ""peacefulness"" as per submission headline), compared to other counties with comparable wealth inequality. It probably helps that we're an island, but in general I'd rather address poverty and stuff, as my specialist subject, before worrying about gun ownership rights.

&gt;It has not been fined for lying and breaching its contract, nor has it lost the job. Its public-sector business just keeps getting bigger as its share price rises. If a private company behaved this way to another private company over a contract, it would find itself in court.

&gt;The fiddling of figures was no mere accountancy exercise, it covered up real risk and a real human cost: terminal cancer patients not receiving home visits in time; the occasion when only one GP was available to cover home visits for the whole county; patients queuing for hours for proper clinical assessment.

true,OJSlaughter,null,null,"&gt;And that leads me to the second bad thing. The last chapter problem. The reveal that [](/s ""Joe Miller, the husband of Detective Ellie Miller""), was the killer, was a rather abrupt turn of events. Up until episode 7 when a person of similar stature was supposedly the guilty party, nothing about [](/s ""Joe"") stuck out and he was rarely seen on screen other than when he was [](/s ""with his wife and their children""). The motive behind it made some sense, but again, there was never any hint about it leading up to episode 7.

I didn't have a problem with this in the slightest. The show was thrilling due to what the investigation brought up within the small community and the characters that inhabited it; which, alongside the constant red herrings, made it a very enjoyable watch. The fact it was [](/s ""Joe Miller"") who was discovered to be the killer in the end was of little consequence (other than giving Olivia Coleman to show how great of an actress she was), it was the journey there that made it fun. I would actually praise the show for not pandering to peoples desire for continuity by placing little nods towards the actual killer early on, the story didn't need it.

&gt;One of two of the only bad things i would say about the show is that they don't follow part of the reason why The Killing's formula is so successful in the first place, and that is the attention to detail. 

I have never watched the killing but if attention to detail is a major selling point, then I won't be touching it. I should say I am normally not a big fan of detective shows.


&gt;Although some people are ruled out of the investigation, there are many lingering questions as to why they done what they did and more specifically where they were. [](/s ""For instance, Danny's [father] is revealed to be having an affair with another woman in the town fairly early on in the series, but the police point out that he still has 2 hours unaccounted for and it's never explained why. One of the other suspects, played by the surprisingly excellent Pauline Quirke, takes the dead boys Skateboard and later hands it to Danny's friend, who just so happens to be the child of one of the detectives on the case. Her motives for taking the skateboard and then giving it to the boy are never made clear. Also, one of the glaringly large ones, who was the man Danny was seen arguing with by the shop owner? Definitely not the man who ended up being guilty."") There are so many more of these instances and they are largely forgotten by the next episode.

I never noticed the thing about [](/s ""his father unaccounted two hours""), so I won't comment on it.

In terms of the Quirke's character. [](/s ""the reason she takes the skateboard is because she thinks he son did it. Maybe she took it in case it was evidence against him (obviously it was to make her a red herring). Why she gave it to Tom, I'm not so sure. I guess she wanted her son to finally be caught? She does mention to the police that she wants her 'father's son' to get help."") To be honest, I wasn't a massive fan of that character at all, she and [](/s ""her son, who basically shouted 'suspect me!' from the start,"") would probably be my strongest criticism of the show.

The ending of Broadchurch had a lot of power and I think describing it as lacking pace is unfair. It's emotional strengths and narrative strength over power the complaints you are making.

That's what i loved about the show too, that it brought out all the secrets of this community. This is something that happens in The Killing too, no stone is left unturned and this is what i mean by the attention to detail part as well. There are largely no unanswered questions.

I found Pauline Quirke's character excellent because her motives, when clear, were very good and great TV. Her connection to Nigel too was fascinating but again i feel like i'm left with more questions about the whole thing.

The only part that lacks pace is the actual reveal. The aftermath and how the people in the village deal with it, especially Danny's family, was excellent to watch. But if you go back and watch the previous 7 episodes, there are almost no connections to who we discover is actually the killer and it feels very underwhelming.

My mom showed up at my apartment as we were going to look at an apartment that evening. Instead of waiting in the parking lot for me, she came inside because the game was on and I wouldn't leave. My mom doesn't really follow the complexities of football, in fact she thinks it boring. Regardless, she watched the final minutes of the game over my shoulder, understanding the importance and emotion of the moment from my body language. 

Barcelona was pinging away at us, shot after shot. I just kept telling her if the game ends now we win, if the game ends now we win. Heart beating so insanely fast, voice cracking. When Torres broke away, and finally scored, I just remember busting out in tears, screaming and hugging her while crying. 

One of the best moments of my life and to be honest, so glad I shared it with my mom.

true,throwaway7898789,null,null,"Some differences (mostly language-related) that you might not already be aware of:

- You cannot write a person. You can write **to** a person; you can write a letter; but writing a person makes as much sense as typing a monkey!

- #\# is ""hash"" or ""number"", not ""pound"". £ is a pound sign.

- UK and US keyboards have different layouts. The letters are the same, but the layout of the keys, and position of symbols varies slightly. Most annoying is that "" and @ swap positions - See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_and_American_keyboards] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_and_American_keyboards)

- Spelling: -or / -our (color / colour), -ize / -ise (organize / organise), -er / -re (center / centre). For more differences: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences)

- Dates are in DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY format. Obvious when the date is 25/4/2013, but 5/6/2013 might be confusing.

- Times in 24-hour clock format (e.g. 17:30) is common. It is **not** called ""military time"".

- The shortened form of ""for example"" is ""e.g."", not ""Ex.""

- Our time zone is GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) in winter, BST (British Summer Time) in summer.

- You may be surprised by what can / cannot be shown or said on TV. We're much less offended by ""the F-word"" and visible nipples than you seem to be.

- We probably have hundreds of derogatory / swear words that you won't be familiar with, and may have trouble understanding how offensive they are. Some are UK-wide; others are specific to particular areas of the country. (e.g. wazzock, pillock, barmpot, numpty, muppet)

- Accents and dialects can be *very* localised. Someone may sound completely different (and use different words / grammar) from someone 10 miles away. The Newcastle accent (Geordie) can be particularly difficult to understand [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhHLmhchLrU) [Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwx0-oewjsM)

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"The same reason they don't outright outlaw placebo pills. If it works only because someone believes it will then does it not still work? The theory behind homeopathy is not so far off from how we make regular medications sometimes actually. A little bit of what ails us or an herb or other substance that can be engineered into a shot to keep us from getting sick in the first place that's how medicine works. 

That's what homeopaths do too, except they dilute those things so far that common sense says it should never work. Yet, for some people it does. It's probably a placebo effect, and I always thought so until I actually met someone who used it regularly and who had seemingly miraculous results sometimes using it. I'm talking kids down with SEVERE chicken pox, up and no pox anywhere in three days. 

I had chicken pox at the same time. I had a light case as a kid apparently and it was not enough to keep me from getting them as an adult again. I got them horribly bad. I was sick as the proverbial flea ridden hound. I didn't expect anything from her remedy. I only took it to be nice. Because she was trying to help, but in less than 5 days I was up, was not scarred a bit, and I was fine and for the record I had those pox everywhere. On my head, on my face, in my ears, up my crotch in places you NEVER want to have chicken pox. I thought I'd be scarred for life after that, I really did. Nope. 

Jury is still out, I'm still pretty skeptical that a solution of sugar and maybe one millionth of a part of something can really help you get better when you are sick but I can't deny that seeing that and experiencing it myself didn't make me a little more respectful of the practice. It was a pretty bizarre experience and it ran counter to every logical expectation I might have had. 

But who gets completely over severe chicken pox as an ADULT in less than 5 days? Yes, a doctor did confirm that they were indeed Chicken Pox and in my case very severe. But there were no meds you could take available at the time. This was a while back, before all the new meds they're using to ease it now. Back then all they had was Oatmeal baths and pink lotion to offer you. 

I still don't know quite what to make of homeopathy and I don't think I would refrain from regular medical treatment to have it but I'm not quite as intolerant as I once was of people who do that.

Anyone trying to escape that face is just not with reality.

This seems to be a common thread of debate with pro firearms people always comparing it to something not dangerous or saying that crime is in no way related to my like of guns. Tell you what I'm a history buff and I like reading about Tanks from WW2 but there's a jolly good reason why I am not allowed to own a German Tiger tank, sure I might not drive around in it shooting up the place but how is anyone else meant to know that.

I say not in the nature of people in this country because it's historically accurate, our police have never been armed and firearms have never been legal without a license. 

Dodging the issue, as I see it, with weak comparisons just makes me think there's something to hide. Guns and their regulation/legality are always linked, always, it's unavoidable for the same reason I'm not allowed to brew up napalm or have a freezer full of chemical weapons or drive to tesco in my armed Tiger Tank.

If you're just drawing with a No. 2 pencil you won't get that. To get the full dark darks and light lights you need HB pencils and charcoal and graphite etc. etc.

And I really do think you are on to a good start. As for the inaccuracies of the facial features and head shapes, there is no special advice. You must keep practicing drawing, specifically because it will help you learn to be aware of the spatial relationships between objects. You might notice that the tips of ears go slightly past the height of the pupils, and that the amount of space between pupils is the width of a mouth etc. etc. You might notice that you've made Matt Smith's head too long, specifically in the jaw area. The human eyes are in the exact middle of the head as far as height goes. Your second Matt Smith picture is better and more proportionate, though you shouldn't draw the full bridge of the nose. As the bridge becomes closer to the surface of the face, it becomes less pronounced and thus, does not need actual *lines* to define it, just shading.

Looking at your 9 and 10 pictures, it looks like you've skewed the face so that the facial features on the right side are slightly higher than the ones on the left.

Keep practicing those spacial relationships.

*Dear Virgin Media,

I'm really sorry for my Father in Law not paying his bill last month, but what with him being dead and all, it's probably slipped his mind. Some people, eh?

You, however, are to be publically commended for swooping in with all the sensitivity of a charging rhino and instantly fining him an extra ten pounds for having the unheard of nerve to be dead and therefore being unable to pay you (some people really have no idea of priorities do they? It's your profit first, THEN anything else. The cheek!).

You also win extra points for noticing his bank had returned his Direct Debit informing you he had passed away, THEN still slapping on a fine anyway. That's a special kind of meanness right there. Oh, and despite my wife telling you our sad news as well. I am intrigued - how exactly did you imagine him paying this extra fine from beyond the grave?

You also deserve a further honorable mention for promptly sending us next months bill as well. I'm simply not paying it, as ever since passing away, I have noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of television my Father in Law has been watching. I simply cannot think why that would be.

I might pay it if you can prove to me he's been watching any of your channels in heaven, but given that British Sky Broadcasting is beamed in directly from the clouds I think he's much more likely to be enjoying that. Your infernal cable pipes seem only to come up from the ground (same location as Hell - spooky coincidence) where I imagine your train people in the art of customer service.

I am bitterly disappointed in your attitude, probably automatically generated by machine and unchecked by any caring human heart. The only saving grace is that my Father in Law had an excellent sense of humour and is probably laughing his arse off about this as we type, giving you the Vs, waving ten pound notes around, planning to haunt you and enjoying the content of Sky TV.

At least at first you will find many of the locals incomprehensible.  When my wife (from London) comes up she genuinely cannot tell if the people chatting that we pass in the street are Geordies or foreign.  There are a couple of universities in the city though, so they're used to out-of-towners and most of them will pick up on the fact that you're American and make themselves vaguely understandable.

Black and white stripes good, red and white stripes bad.

Do not take your cues as to whether you should wear a coat from the locals.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; You've got to the point of just putting Scotland down, wanting to keep it in it's place

This ""putting Scotland down"" thing that we all constantly hear about is baffling. It isn't *putting Scotland down* to point out it's a tenth the size of the rest of the UK, and as such will never have the same economic punching power. Along the same lines, I'm not sure what *keeping Scotland in its place* really means. Scotland **is** a small nation and if independent will be constrained by that, in ways which people haven't considered.

To me at least it makes sense for the Scots to push for some form of maximum devolution. This would minimise the impact of being a small nation in the shadow of an economic giant, whilst simultaneously having the advantages of more direct control over policy. If nothing else... if independence really is the long term answer for the Scots, then devolution seems like the logical stepping stone towards it, rather than plunging head first into uncharted territory.

&gt; Didn't have to suffer policies that don't benefit us

Alex Salmond is a lucky man at the moment, because he gets the notoriety of spending money, whilst Westminster has the unpopular task of raising that money through taxation. This is another great reason to go for devolution, even if only as a stepping stone to independence. It would give Scots the confidence that their government and politicians are acting in their best interests. Right now, because the Scottish government has very limited powers to raise finances, and recives its money through a complex formula, it is essentially only doing half the actions of a government (spending, the other half being taxation).  

To be honest though, with the exception of a few single-issue controversial subjects like Trident I don't really see what policies you have to *suffer*, since just about all internal affairs are either already devolved or likely to go that way in the near future. Obviously the two recent wars were unpopular, but don't forget they were unpopular in England to - I certainly wouldn't paint the English as having a different set of views just because a government in Westminster made a bad choice - we all suffered that. I wouldn't let those experiences taint what is actually a pretty good foriegn relations/human rights record, particulary in recent memory with places like Kosovo.

&gt; I'm confident in Scotland's people and their ability to make it in the world without relying on aid and advice from patronising and ungenerous individuals.

I don't doubt for a second Scotlands ability to become an independent nation. I don't think any reasonably minded commentator on this subject feels that is the case.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Well, that's because you are wilfully ignoring the point I am making.

When it comes to healthcare money is lives, patients, nurses, doctors, everything. The doctors you hire need money. The drugs you use cost money. The MRI machine needs to be built, and that costs. Having clean sheets, decent hospital food, this costs money.

Now there are two ways of getting money. The first, direct subsidy from the state, the second, efficiency. When you acquire only what you need when you need it you can end up being far more useful and beneficial to patients.

Money is lives, and if you block innovation and efficiency you are resulting in more deaths and worse standards of living for people I hospitals.

i want an efficient, modern healthcare system free at the point of use. You are not superior to me. I only recognise the importance of the market in driving innovation and making things better for patients. I don't want to make money from it, I only want what is best for patients.

This is why I detest the debate about the NHS in this country, you have to toe an exceptionally narrow line or else you are evil and only want to make money.

The overwhelming majority of people who want to reform the NHS are motivated by wanting to help patients, myself included. Just because we recognise the merits of innovation and efficiency doesn't mean and don't drink the Cool-ade over the out of date structure we currently have doesn't mean we are only motivated by what is best for patients.

true,morninghash,devon,the bramblefuck,"I'm an American who has been living here a few years now and here's my advice:

1. Nice days are sacred. The summer is fleeting and the autumn and winter can be grey and wet and dark and miserable, so make the most out of nice sunny days in July-September. Don't take them for granted!

2. This country is incredibly unique and interesting. If you're willing to learn about the history and visit the sites, you'll get a much better appreciation for what makes the UK so special. Six months isn't nearly the amount of time you'd need to soak it all in, but in that time you can see some world class historical places. There are castles, abbeys, medieval towns, and a very famous wall made by a guy named Hadrian that are all within a train's journey from Newcastle. Yorkshire Dales and the Peak District are accessible from there too and worth a visit. York and Whitby are two gorgeous towns you could have a weekend in. Check out www.englishheritage.co.uk and www.nationaltrust.co.uk for some ideas.

3. Go to one cricket match, one rugby game, and one football (soccer) match while you are here. Sports here are kind of like microcosms of social classes. The atmosphere at each one of those will be totally different, they will all offer you a different window into the culture here. Your local teams will be Durham Cricket Club, Newcastle Falcons, and Newcastle United.

4. Go to pubs and have a pint of ale. Go to a number of pubs and see the different character in each of them. You don't live in cider country but the cider is great too. Have the local/smaller brewery stuff, the ale here is good and diverse.

5. Don't big yourself up. People don't like that. Also, don't compare everything to America. I can't speak for northerners, because I don't live there, but they have a reputation for being friendlier. But don't expect friendliness... people here won't go out of their way to be friendly; expect some standoffishness. Additionally, don't defend America's god damn gun laws, that's like the first thing people ask about and I guarantee you'll find yourself in that situation... just don't go there! 

6. Go see Scotland and Wales. Edinburgh is a world class city, one of my favorite places here. You can drive to the highlands from Edinburgh, but you'll need a car that you trust and you don't want to go there in the winter. Wales is the most underrated place in the UK; for a longer trip go to Anglesey or Snowdonia National Park. It's a beautiful place to visit.

7. Someone alluded to this already, but British people will always say something is shit. Don't take their word for it, it's usually not shit. If it is actually shit, a general rule of thumb is that *you can't complain about it*; the British have a strange sense of pride about the shittiness of things and by agreeing with them you're almost being insulting.

8. Learn to love tea. You won't have to try hard, you will just learn over time. Wait until you have three weeks straight of overcast, 40 degrees with drizzle weather and you'll be hooked on this warm, non-offensive and mildly stimulating beverage. You'll drink tea just for the sake of drinking tea.

9. Don't worry about all the cultural differences, just be respectful of people and 99% will be respectful back. You're there for six months, not a lifetime. Just enjoy the place as it is, travel to the sites that make it special, and don't be bothered by trying to fit in too much.

The Fascist and Communist regimes of the era were totalitarian. There was no concept of the rule of law. If the state wanted to make something happen, it happened. If it wanted to take your property, imprison you or execute you, then the courts would rubber stamp the decision. 

In the criminal justice system of the former Soviet Union, your defence lawyer was limited to giving good character witness. He couldn't argue that you had an alibi. Your guilt was an established fact because the police would not have arrested you if you weren't guilty.

So the ECHR was brought in to help prevent a resurgence of fascism, or an emergence of totalitarian communism. It prevents a system of government where ""because the state wants it to happen"" trumps the law.

&gt; Muslims Against Crusades believe that Muslims are not ""obliged to obey the law of the land in whatever country they reside"".[6] In 2011, the group proposed that Muslims should set up independent emirates in select cities in the UK, operating under Sharia entirely outside British law.

If you read the [first link](http://news.sky.com/story/1065276/muslim-convert-dart-admits-terror-offence) I posted about, dart himself admitted that he became an extremist after joining that group, in a documentary his brother made about him. So how can you say that you know his motivations better than he does? You may not be comfortable with the idea that religion can make people do evil things, but to stare the evidence in the face and call it something else is stupidity.

As for this point:

&gt; Aside from that, the purposes of justice (punishment of guilty and protection of society) are met without those details, so it's irrelevant there. It's also irrelevant for the general public as it makes no difference to the case - public interest is purely of a gossipy nature, as the knowledge changes nothing.

This is not the judicial ruling on their offences we are talking about, this is news reporting. The whole news industry is based on this 'gossipy nature', and to say that knowledge of the relevant facts of a case changes nothing is absurd. News reporters should be reporting the news, not censoring it, which the BBC does in every story that casts islam in a negative light. 

All religions have problems with extremists, but of the major religions, islam is by far the worst. They create an environment in which extremism can flourish, by following a holy book that advocates war, by promoting faith as a virtue, by revering martyrs and setting them up as role models, by promoting the idea of holy war, by casting non believers as enemies of islam and lesser people, and by giving extremist preachers a platform to keep spreading their hate to impressionable young people. They do these things, then act like these extremists have nothing to do with their moderate views.

true,TheMania,null,null,"The following (and a lot more from the PDF) all still applies to the UK despite not being the US:

&gt; Buiter just asserts that governments in the advanced
countries will face positive real interest rates on their public
debt. He does not explain why this should be so—especially for
the United States.

&gt; In economic terms, it normally should not be so for a sovereign borrower who controls her own currency and therefore
cannot default. Why not? Because to an investor safety is valuable, and because under capitalism making money ought to
require taking risk. There is no reason why a 100 percent–safe
borrower should pay a positive real rate of return on a liquid
borrowing! The federal government doesn’t need to compensate for risk. It isn't trying to kill off a high and intractable inflation. It also doesn’t need to lock in borrowing overtime; it pays
the higher rate on long bonds mainly as a gift to banks. [4]
Moreover, it controls both the short-term rate and the maturity
structure of the public debt, and so can issue as much short
debt at a near-zero rate as it needs.

Because there can never be a safer loan one can make in GBP than to the UK government, bond markets *cannot* move against the government, and so we can *always* supplement revenue with bond sales to fund a deficit.

Contrary to Cameron's mistaken beliefs, the constraint on a currency-issuer's spending is always inflation, not taxation revenue. If we heat up demand past what the economy can grow to meet we will end up with inflation (or assuming the BoE acts appropriately, higher interest rates), but as there's never a real risk of default the government will never have issue selling bonds for high prices (/low interest) - no free-floating currency issuing government ever has had issue selling bonds, not even Japan, another nation with little natural resources.

The whole move to austerity was out of concern for a never-before-realised hypothetical, that bond markets might come to be concerned about loaning pounds to the UK government. A hypothetical that doesn't even make any logical sense, yet concern for it is why the economy's been going nowhere for years. It's tragic..

I don't think capitalism has failed. It has been the greatest instrument of human achievement, bringing billions of people out of poverty and empowering the public far more than any government, union or revolutionary has ever done. It is imperfect and requires regulations by government, but that does not mean that it is flawed. The answer to people being above the law is not to hate capitalism, it is to stop them from being so. As a capitalist, the lack of moral hazard in the banking system horrifies me and I would have let the banks go under rather than bail them out, it was the state and government through corporate welfare that distorted the market, not capitalism.

So, that is my answer. Offer and accept hefty rewards, but empower the state and shareholders to hold these individuals to account so that when they fuck up they are sacked and can be, if liable, arrested for fraud. I have no problem with the rich getting richer and no problem with capitalism, but we need the state to ensure it is capitalism rather than corporatism.

Unfortunately as the left cant tell the difference between the two and the right either becomes too pragmatic rather than principled or becomes too principled to prevent corporatism (ie, why I am not a libertarian) this is never going to happen.

Add this *argument in principle* to the fact that a lot of pubs are tied to pub companies who often make more money out of property leases, because of property bubbles, and you'll see that it probably wasn't that the pub wasn't profitable but, rather, a Sainsburies was more profitable even if there was already a shop a quarter of a mile a way. 

In this sense we can see that as long as human behaviour is reflected in the markets (irrational bubbles, acting on incomplete information, a lack of foresight, unethical behaviour) we can't argue that *the market is always best* or that it will always provide what is needed for because of competition.

All I would say is that capitalism doesn't create poverty. We were all poor until 200 years ago other than one or two warlords. Poverty was the natural human condition until capitalism came along.

Now, you are only right on the driving people into poverty point if you believe that poverty should be judged in relative and absolute terms, which I dispute. In objective terms, capitalism has taken billions of people out of poverty, the fact that statistically this means our idiotic definition of poverty as a fraction of average wealth creates some idiotic outliers, but that should not tar the greatness that capitalism has created.

So, yeah, would you mind translating from strange sociology terms into a proper argument? I mean.

I went looking forward to seeing if the zombie infestation was caused by a bacteria or virus...it turned out to be a prion.  Prions only infect brain tissue, they aren't contagious unless you happen to eat the infected brain tissue of said zombie, also prions are fatal, there is no reanimation after a prion infection, you just go a bit mental and then drop dead, hence not a good zombie maker.  Not only that but they tried to claim that prions will infect organs, one by one.  They don't, they really don't. 

However the organ thing was crucial to the evening as it applied to the cure scenario.  We can use 3D printers to make organs out of stem cells.   Yes you can! But you have to use stem cells that either came from the person whose organs you are replacing or from somebody closely related to them otherwise...tissue rejection!  They kinda forgot that part.

Finally we had to choose which scenario we wanted:

- Cull the infected, some uninfected may get killed.

- Cure using the stem cell method even though all the organs will probably be rejected. (Literally no mention whatsoever of developing a vaccine from those who were found to be immune)

- Sacrifice by blowing up Edinburgh and the surrounding area.

Absolutely, but irredentism remains a good approximation of your attitude.

&gt; *OK, I erred slightly, in saying ""which of her 3 kingdoms"" [emphasis added] instead I should have said which of the 3 kingdoms that were united in the UK was Wales?*

I've already answered that: it was a part of the Kingdom of England. It no longer is. 

&gt; *But now you're saying that Wales isn't a part of that kingdom any longer that it has somehow been de-annexed? What law was passed then to make this new Wales (which never before existed as a state in that form) a part of the UK?*

That is precisely what I'm saying. Wales could not possibly be a part of a kingdom that does not exist in any case, and as I've repeatedly made clear, Wales is clearly constitutionally distinct from England and has been diverging from it since the nineteenth century. 

The law that was passed to make Wales a part of the United Kingdom was the 1707 Act of Union - in 1707, Wales was a part of the Kingdom of England, and that Kingdom in its entirety was incorporated into a larger union. I'm not sure what concept you're having trouble with, any more. 

&gt; *You can't end annexation.*

If a player with no track record of bad behavior did the same thing it would have been a 3 game ban. Keeping in mind Jermaine Defoe bit Macherano and only received a yellow card some years ago. 

The biting act of a 5 year old is childish, however harmless. At no point was there any threat of injury to Branislav, yet over the years of watching EPL I have seen professional/intentional fouls on players that have left the victims on stretchers. Branislav throughout this ordeal has acted extremely humbly by not pushing for Suarez to be punished, which I respect, but also expected.

If Luis decides to leave Liverpool (which I don't think he will,) I wouldn't blame him, because if I were in his shoes I too would feel gimped by the FA. His skill and desire to win is a breath of fresh air in this league, and the FA has not shown they would mind losing him to the likes of La Liga, Bundesliga or Serie A. For me the players I enjoy watching the most, as a pure spectator of the game regardless of team bias, are RVP, Luis Suarez, Juan Mata, Hazard, and Bale. There is already speculation of some of these players leaving for Real Madrid and the like, and the fact that some retards in reddit actually call Luis Suarez scum, and say they'd be happy for him to be out of this league will only set a precedent for many other international players, as well as the EPL, especially considering any team would be over the moon to have him as their striker, bar Man U.

So the first bit, employment is probably not relevant to a private block.  However about 12 years ago (sadly before my time) there were some working girls using flat 4 apparently.

But as for healthy lifestyle these things definitely do come up as does local community, sometimes its a case of provisions for cycling or children and such.  Given that most private tenants have by definition enough of a success to not need employment or education advice.

If they are wanting to foster a real community, then these are the things a community has an interest in.

How is asking someone what they think they could give to the society a bad thing?  How is promoting people to live in a healthy manner a remotely bad thing, plenty of buildings are finding ways of banning smoking often under that idea.

- Restaurants: The staff will generally return your receipt on a small tray along with a few mints - use this tray to leave a cash tip. Don't wait for them to collect it - they won't. Just leave it on the table when you leave. Also, forget percentages, this isn't america. £2-5 is more than acceptable. 
- Taxi's: Again, generally, don't tip. If you do, the accepted approach is ""keep the change"", which shouldn't generally be more than a pound or so. 
- Hotels: If you're in a posh place with a porter, it is acceptable to tip him if he carries your bags to your room. Otherwise, don't bother. 
- Casino's: Probably the most Americanised  of them all in terms of tipping culture. They will always have signs telling you whether they allow tipping. Many don't. If they do, just tip whatever you feel comfortable with.

true,TheMania,null,null,"Investors don't necessarily have a choice.

Cash in a safe is a completely safe investment option that returns negative real interest and there's nothing to say that other completely safe investment options will return more than that, at least not short term liquid investments.

We even see private sector bonds going for negative real interest today - Apple and Samsung borrowing at [&lt; 2% interest](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1d0ejh/apple_would_rather_go_into_debt_than_bring_home/c9lrmvv) with Samsung's bond auction oversubscribed 5:1. UK government short term bonds are going for negative real interest, as are the US's. As the Levy Institute article says, selling longer term bonds is not at all required by the government - it's a policy option, something the author claims is a subsidy to the banking sector (wouldn't surprise me).

It is important to realise that bonds don't actually hold up your wealth in any meaningful way, least of all short term bonds. Government bonds are some of the most liquid assets there are, you can exchange them for cash to spend virtually on demand. They're only a minor inconvenience for you vs simply storing cash itself, and when backed by the currency-issuer they're just as safe.. so why should you expect a positive real return?

As for investing in different currencies, we don't have a fixed exchange rate. Under a floating exchange rate you need to buy Euros from someone looking to buy your GBP, and to redeem your profits later you need to find sellers of GBP. Given a bit of thought it becomes clear - that cannot ever be considered a ""completely safe investment"". For you to invest your GBP in a Euro using nation, you're *depending* on finding more GBP available to you at a later date, that the GBP exchange rate has depreciated (or at least not climbed) whilst you were investing the Euros you purchased. The thing is, the moment that becomes a ""completely safe bet"" investors would all be doing it, all buying up Euros, pushing the exchange rate down to a point where it's no longer a completely safe bet that it'll remain down in the future. One example of this would be the yen - even when safe investment options in yen are all returning virtually zilch interest, people still buy them up. For them, investing in foreign currencies is still a more risky option.

Investing in gold has the exact same problem for that matter - to extract more fiat later you're depending on there being more people looking to buy it when you're selling than when you bought in. If it *were* a sure bet, the price of gold would have already been bid up to the point that it's no longer a sure bet leaving you taking some level of risk.

So now we're back to where we started - to make a real positive gain, you have to take some level of risk. The risk-free options - keeping as cash, lending to another bank on the overnight interbank lending markets, lending to Apple or Samsung are returning real negative interest and there's nothing much investors can do about it.

The above assumes that the central bank is targeting low interest rates, but this is a state we can bring that about any time we desire by running contractionary fiscal policy and that being the case there's no reason today to be concerned about the deficit due to interest rates rising in the future - they are always under our control.",0,1366896255,null,0,false,0,c9mch5y,t3_1d2lvr,t1_c9mch5y,t1_c9mbks1,null,1431433814,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Describing people as 'bigots' simply so you can bolster your own opinions (which without detailing *why* they're bigots is really what you're doing) doesn't really get anywhere or produce anything. And you compound the problem by, it would appear, using that label on anyone that doesn't agree with you.

&gt;And, regardless of that, my lack of tolerance for them has nothing to do with how and why I formed my pro-gay-marriage opinion in the first place. 

So...you're dealing with a lack of tolerance by exhbiting a complete lack of tolerance. Righto, always a winning approach. I do wonder how you formed your opinion when you don't seem to have investigated anything with regards to legal/ parliamentary/ democratic process, which leaves you sounding like someone that read a tabloid or two and assumed that was all that was necessary to start shouting.

&gt;You may have all decided that everything I say in this thread should be downvoted and reviled regardless of content

There is no content. That's the point.

&gt;but assuming I'm an unthoughtful and regressive fool is rather ill-informed and impulsive

No, that's how you're presenting yourself. It's not anyone else's job to make up the shortfall for you.

&gt;We both know I'm on the right side, from both an ethical and rational standpoint

Which does *not* give you license go off on ill-considered rants about how everything just isn't good enough and slag off the lawmaking process because it doesn't meet your individual standards. Being right is not a shield - just ask Peter Tatchell about how well his citizens' arrest of Mugabe went down; what you're doing is no different to people posting incorrect comparisons of pensioners' and refugees benefits on facebook - an own-goal trick that allows onlookers to dismiss a valid concern.

&gt;The mob assumption that I must be doing it for the wrong reasons simply because I voiced my opinion passionately is... bemusing, to say the least

Not sure about the 'wrong reasons' - I'd suggest the consensus is that you're just doing it wrong. Nothing causes problems like well-intentioned naievety, and I don't use that word lightly - the fact that you're suprised by the reaction simply reinforces this.

&gt;Sometimes folk just like to get on the downvote wagon.

If you don't want to encourage them, bring something new to the table. You've mentioned more than once about how carefully you've considered your opinion, but you haven't made that many (any?) posts in this thread which actually back that assertion up.

Also, I always feel kind of sorry for prorogation. It's the State Opening's poorer, more socially awkward and less popular cousin. Plus it's all the poorer for the lack of Thomas Dunlop du Roy de Bliquy Galbraith's name being read out.

If anyone's interested, there's [a history of Royal Assent](http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/lareyne.pdf) (expected to take place this prorogation) on Parliament's website which I thought was quite cool. Royal Assent given by Royal Commission was invented so that Henry VIII didn't have to assent in person to a bill for Catharine Howard's execution...

Also, initially prorogation [was designed](http://pp549.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/reforming-prorogation/) to prolong the life of a parliament; once all its business was concluded and all bills assented to (couple of months max), Parliament was assumed to die and so a new election would have to have been held to pass further bills. The Kings of England invented prorogation so that they didn't have go through the hassle of elections for a new parliament when they wanted more money (presumably it crossed their minds that the new one might also be more hostile to their agenda). It was part of the constitutional settlement of the UK back in those days - the King got some of his money, the Parliament got some of their grievances resolved.

We're lucky in the UK that prorogation is by convention only really used in non-controversial ways. In Canada it's been used a few times for governments to [avoid](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html) [parliamentary](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2009/12/30/parliament-prorogation-harper.html) [scrutiny](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/10/15/toronto-mississauga-gas-plant.html) - what's more, they don't even get the wigs and doffing; the prime minister simply advises the Governor General to issue a proclamation.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"I don't agree that 4-2-3-1 is here to say. To the extent of my knowledge, the board wants attractive football. I don't think they mind what formation  we play as long as we get results. Additionally, to say that nearly every top team plays that formation is an exaggeration. Barca play 4-3-3, and are going to win La Liga. Man U have already one the PL, using mostly 4-4-2. The fact that one of their strikers drops into midfield is an aspect of their style, not a formation change (it might better be referred to as a 4-4-1-1). Juventus are probably going to win Serie, and they play mostly 3-5-2. So out of the top 4 leagues (Spain, England, Italy, and Germany), the only league champions using 4-2-3-1 are Bayern (who next year have a good chance of switching to 4-3-3 under Pep). 

4-2-3-1 is a useful formation, but there's no reason we should be married to it. Our unwillingness to change formation has really been our downfall; we don't have the personnel to play attacking 4-2-3-1 correctly. The obvious weakness you have pointed out, in the pivot, on the wings, and up top. The problems go further though, as our defense is struggling with this system. Luiz is our only CB mobile enough to keep a higher line, so we seriously lack depth here if we insist on 4-2-3-1. 

We could play this like FIFA and change half the squad over the summer just to fulfill a formation we like, or we could play a formation that already suits our squad much better (like 4-3-3). I'm a believer that the formation should be a system that makes the best out of the players you have, rather than having players adapt to a formation.

Confidence absolutely is important - its most critical in consumer spending (the general public does not do a C/B analysis when they are buying a sofa, they generally go off their gut feel for stuff) but it is almost as significant in business. 

Any business worth their salt can drum up endless enterprises that have a projected positive cost benefit that far outstrips interest rates (which are historically low right now). But these need a confident management team to give these the green light to go ahead. In fact financially speaking cash is losing money sat in the bank as it is being outstripped by inflation - its a pretty low bar required to beat that. 

Chief Economist at Deloitte says about it ""The key to unlocking these cash piles is to give corporates a greater sense of confidence about the future.""  He is specifically referring to confidence in the gov and future growth - of course economic outlook plays a big part of that in the biggest of companies - but most SMEs are left with much more pedestrian opinions of how well they think their money can be turned into growth.

Obviously the Louvre etc attract more visitors than pretty much anything else in that location would.* But there are plenty of worthwhile museums that attract people, but not as many people as a supermarket the same size would ... and I'm guessing most of us agree that they should be kept open, and not sold on to a supermarket chain, anyway.

Not sure I would place local pubs in the same category as musea ;-), but I think that's the reasoning jazimov is going for - sometimes something can have a higher cultural value (and is worth therefore keeping open) than something else even if that something else would make more of a profit.

How you would apply a solution in the case of local pubs I dunno - I doubt voters would go along with subsidies for pubs. But there are places which have put licensing restrictions in place to keep, for example, big-box shops out of old town streets to protect their look, so I suppose there are precedents for regulation.

And all just because they mistakenly believe themselves to be some stalwart guardian of freedom and democracy. 

Well, here's some news. The royal charter offered by the government had enough provisions in it to ensure the press remained impartial without ministerial interference. It was by and large not much different to the sort of regulation that current TV and news stations have to undergo. 

To all the naysayers and press apologists, freedom and democracy are not defended by making up lies and hacking dead children's phones. Has there since those despicable stories came to light early last year any change in the press's behaviour? None whatsoever. They are still printing the same shit to try and sell papers at any cost possible without any regard to who they're victimising (recall the transgender teacher in the Littlejohn article who committed suicide).

Energy supply was privatised. Do we have the best energy suppliers in Europe? No. We have amongst the most expensive per unit costs in Europe and very little investment in infrastructure because private finance is not interested in maintaining a deteriorating non earning asset (infrastructure) even though it's vital for them to sell us electricity / gas via it.

Now we have yet another Tory government paving the legal way for piecemeal privatisation of the NHS. Look at the above two examples. How is this going to work out?

* No competition on price- when I go to Tescos I can see directly if costs goes up and can decide to go somewhere else. With American healthcare people never look at the price directly so they just pick a hospital even if it's expensive and then year on year their insurance has to go up as hospitals charge more.

Getting a decent manager should be top priority and far more important than any player. This will also largely influence what formation we will play and what players we need, if any. 

That being said we do need another holding midfielder to support Mikel. We can't keep playing Ramires beside him, because quite frankly he is rubbish in that position. I like Luiz in the DM position, but he is a far better CB and I think Oscar would fair much better here than Luiz.  I keep saying this but Paulihno would be a great buy, Fellani would be as well. I also agree we should be playing Chalobah a heck of a lot more. 

In regards to the attacking midfield, I disagree we don't need anyone. Schurrle will be a great addition if we get him and I wouldn't be opposed to that, but lets be honest, Moses is a great player and fits that role fine. Just because he has had a bit of a dry spell lately doesn't mean we need to panic and buy a new player.

In regard to strikers again, again we don't NEED to buy a new striker. Lukaku and Ba up front would be a lethal combination. Torres is good for tournaments when we need to rest the other two. Sure spending money on a striker would be great (I'll tell you this, no chance in hell Lewandowski is coming anymore so I would stop putting his name out there, and I doubt Cavanni or Falcao will come for cheap) but I put a lot of faith in Lukaku and recon next year is going to be his year.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Let's say we get 25m for him, in addition to cutting our wage bill by at least £5m PA, it gives us some serious purchasing power. 

If we looks at what we need, and what we can get for the price- we can not only replace him with depth, but quality.

Diame would be an amazing guy to bring in- like Fellaini he is gritty, tough, can defend and get forward. He doesn't have the goal threat of Fella, but for £3.5m (his clause) we can afford another player who does that. 

In terms of forwards, another player with a buyout clause is Remy. A pace merchant who pushes defences back (something that Baines and Mary Ellis absolutely thrive off), can finish and is available for £8m. Other clubs will certainly be interested, but Everton can offer a very attractive package to him. 

So that is £11.5m of the £25m spent in this fantasy scenario- with probably about equal spending on wages- but lets see if we can upgrade the rest of the squad. 

With Barkely coming good, Gibbo looking like a star and Diame there to sure things up; midfield is not a real concern. The wings are looking great, and the left and right back positions are attractive, especially if Coleman can keep up the form he has shown over the past 6 months...

That leaves CB and GK. With Heitinga surely on his way out, and Distin getting on a bit I feel it is time to invest here- Grant Hanley has been linked with us, and for me there is no better option. He is young, but if we are keeping Distin around for at least another year, he gives us depth and a bit more balance to our back line- a very Unsworth simple CB type, but still young and posessing quality... Could be had for a good price because I doubt he will be happy to spend another year in the Championship. Lee Peltier is a local lad who might be available on the cheap also. 

We do also need a keeper to replace Howard- Sean Johnson is a punt, but could pay off...Brad Guzan also another option. A bit tougher this position to make a decision on though. ",0,1366904135,null,0,false,0,c9mez9a,t3_1cwz55,t1_c9mez9a,t3_1cwz55,null,1431432634,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

People have such nice homes now with so much entertainment available within them and cheap, good quality beers available at supermarkets so you need to give people a strong incentive to go out.  Simply selling beer in a slightly darkened room is not enough any more.

The pub I work in is absolutely thriving because the landlord has moved with the times:

* He maintains great relationships with everyone in the pub so people have birthdays, engagements etc there. 

* He has a pool team, a football team, the people from his golf club have meetings there.  All weekly and all on separate nights.

* The pool table is actually fucking level and well maintained.

* The decor is kept nice and fresh and well maintained including a properly covered smoking area.

It is not a cheap pub but it has a huge amount of regulars because it is a nice place to go and the beer is well kept and served in the correct glasses.

Supermarkets are usually more convenient as you can buy everything you need and they're usually cheaper too. But you can't blame the Supermarkets for this. It's several generations ago the shift from local stores to Supermarkets happened and since then, every individual that has shopped in one has contributed to what has happened in stokes croft.

true,Mr_Jpg,flair5,,"Here's how it's going to happen:

Last game of the season, Chelsea are 3rd, Arsenal are 4th (game in hand) and we're in 5th. 

We're playing fantastic, but we can't get the goal. Defoe had a couple chances, but Sunderland have decided that it's a good time to play like ~~Barcelona~~ Stoke last season.

We've made 2 substitutions, Adebayor for Defoe and Holtby for Parker. Holtby has really livened the game up, but without Defoe a goal is impossible. Bale is playing, but he can't get through the extremely low-line defence. 

3rd substitution is announced, Huddlestone is on for Benny. We don't care about going into a 3-5-2 because right now it's a win or bust.

It's the 94th minute, and Huddlestone can't get into the game. But suddenly we see a new side of him, an aggression fuelled afrotastic one. 

The ball is played in from a Sunderland corner, but Huddlestone heads the ball out. Bale runs out to get the ball but a quick look at Huddlestone and he realises what is about to happen. Huddlestone taps the ball around the first slide-tackle and he begins to get into a stride. The second tackle flies in but Huddlestone simply runs through the tackle, not taking the time and effort to move out the way.

He reaches the 40 yard line and a slow clap begins. Each and every tottenham fan in the world begins clapping and chanting ""Oh when the Spurs"" and Sunderland can't comprehend what is happening. 

Huddlestone then smashes the ball with all the power he can gather into one final shot. The crowd falls silent, Mignolet dives as if his life depends on it and Huddlestone merely smurks. The ball travels at a record 132 mph, a thunderous boom is heard around the ground (light travels faster than sound) and the ball goes into the top right corner. Tottenham win 1-0, putting them 3rd and knocking Arsenal out of the Champions league altogether.

In fact, you'll find that teams playing one often will naturally transition into the other based on the flow of the game. A great example of this was yesterday, when Madrid ended up in a 4-3-3 for most of the game as Modric dropped deeper to deal with Dortmund's domination of the midfield.

What is the significance of this? The squad needs to play a 4-3-3 and a 4-2-3-1 are basically the same. If there is a difference, it is that the 4-2-3-1 doesn't demand traditional wingers, and in that sense, it suits our current squad better.

I'm not suggesting we blindly stick to the 4-2-3-1, I just don't want it to be demonized, as it is a good scheme.
