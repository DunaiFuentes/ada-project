You've shown no humour and even attempted to form vote brigades in your attempts to set people right. Use that subreddit for what it's meant for, a harmless bit of fun! Otherwise your behaviour is becoming embarrassing and you are in danger of becoming the joke. 

Lighten up, enjoy reddit and don't get riled up by satirical subreddits.

In order to own one, you must obtain a class III firearms license.  To do so, you must pay a high tax, have a gun shop that will act as a middle man when buying an assault rifle, submit multiple forms to the atf, and give your fingerprints and physical description to the police, as well as a mulitude of other forms.  (The same license is also needed to own any kind of supressor).


The AR-15, a common semiautomatic ""assault rifle,"" only looks like an assault rifle.  The AR in the name, believe it or not, stands for [ArmaLite](http://www.armalite.com/).

Armalite sold its AR-15 design to Colt years ago due to financial problems, and the name went with it.

true,riquiscott,tardis,TARDIS,"Copypasta from original post because I'm on my phone &amp; can't figure out how to link...

It's really not hard, just time intensive &amp;amp; requires patience. First, the shoes: cheap hooker shoes. No, seriously, don't spend a lot. The finish needs to be as smooth as possible, no texture, no embellishment.* These were regularly 14.99, knocked down to 8.99 cheap plastic ""faux patent"" tramp shoes I picked up a Charlotte Russe. 


Next, pick your design. You can do paper based (I've used comic book images for Wonder Woman shoes. The Pi shoes were wrapping paper from Think Geek) or fabric based. Honestly, the fabric ones are way better/easier. Spoonflower.com has any fabric you could ever want. The TARDIS and Firefly shoes are fabric wraps. 


Next, Mod Podge, scissors, SHARP Exacto knife, a sponge brush, towel and paper towels. Figure out the lay of the pattern on the fabric and how you want it on the shoe. The FF &amp;amp; T shoes I left the heel exposed because the color matched. If you can't match then you'll need to wrap the heel first. 


Cut out a wedge 2 inches longer and 1 inch wider than the heel. Coat the heel liberally with Mod Podge (from hence forth MP cause I'm getting lazy) Repeat for second heel, set aside and let dry (about 30-45 min depending on temp/humidity) 


Cut out an oval in your fabric large enough to cover the whole shoe, leaving about 1/2 inch hanging past the sole. Cut the oval almost entirely in half long ways, starting at the heel and ending at about 1/2-1 inch from the front top of the shoe. 

Coat the top front (nose) liberally in MP and start laying your fabric, eeking out wrinkles, bubbles, etc as you go. work around one side of the shoe. At the heel, cut your fabric so it goes past the middle of the back by about 1/4 inch. coat the other side with MP, lay down fabric. 


When you get to the heel, cut fabric to 1/2 inch, fold in half and lay over the overlap. Trim the top fabric 1/2 inch around the top. 


Cut triangles towards the shoe ending about 1/8 from the shoes every 1/2 inch all the way around. Coat the inside top of the shoe with MP and start working the triangles down. You'll need 2 or 3 coats to get it to lay down solid. 

Wait for the shoes to completely dry (over night) then take the Exacto knife and trim the bottom over hang right where the sole meets the actual shoe. 


Over the next 2 days put on coats of MP, allowing to dry completely between coats so it doesn't get milky. On cloth, I use 5-6 coats. On paper you need 15 coats MINIMUM. Once all coats are on, wait 2 full days then wet sand them smooth. 


First use 200-300 grit WET sandpaper and you are going to want to wet sand these babies. You know you are done with the 200-300 when there are no shiny or high spots left. Let dry. 


Wet sand again with 400-600. This will give you a nice satin finish. You can stop here or you can go 800-1000 wet sand for a higher gloss. 


All told, about 5 hours. If you want an DIY on the paper coated shoes, let me know and I'll type it later. But I've discovered the cloth ones are superior. The paper tends not to flex well with the shoe &amp;amp; you get cracks that let moisture in which causes the paper to peel off the shoe in places. Lots of wear and the paper coated shoes just die (an ugly death considering the amount of work that went in to them)

1. The Clara at the start of *The Name of the Doctor* was the original Clara who had not yet entered the time stream. 

2. The Clara throughout most of *The Name of the Doctor* didn't see the Doctor's future regenerations until she jumped into the time stream at the end of the story and was dead/destroyed/spread throughout the Doctor's timeline.

3. Prior to that moment, Clara had already seen many faces of the Doctor, all from his past, all of his past regenerations. That's where Clara's quote comes from, from the time when she had not been in the time stream, when she had not seen any future regenerations.

4. It's not possible for Clara to have seen John Hurt if he is a future regeneration, and if Hurt is a past regeneration than he was hidden from Clara. It's one or the other. 

5. If Hurt is a future regeneration, Hurt could be the 29th regeneration because Clara couldn't see the future because Clara was not yet spread across the Doctor's time stream.

My thinking is this: if you want a strong female character or a trans character on equal footing to the Doctor, wouldn't you rather it be someone completely new? Independent of him and with their own lovable traits and personality quirks? Captain Jack is a fantastic example of a progressive character who is distinctly unique and awesome in every respect!

Notice at around the same time certain state figures started making similar statements.  A sequence of leaks and murmurings.  America, Australia, Japan, Italy.    Not backing it up, or anything - just gentle prods to stay in the EU.  Or arguing why successive administrations in their own country would see it that way.  Or addressing how Free Trade Agreements between countries of all sizes are happening all the time, big and small.

In a name: Roland Rudd.  Roland Rudd, heavily connected to Peter Mandelson, James Murdoch, New Labour, big business, big oil, Bush doctrine, and all round Horcrux.  

Chairman of Business for New Europe, which Mandelson attends, and co-founder of Finsbury which was embroiled in the Mandelson yacht-scandal, Roland Rudd who was centre of the Mandelson *'Favours for Friends'* BAA scandal.  Rudd's connection in Washington: Sir David Manning (connected Blair-Bush and to the Iraq war), pops into the White House, and a statement is suddenly being made on an Obama visit.  Enrico Letta attends the Italian embassy in London with Mandelson and Rudd present, later he too warns against a UK exit.   Everywhere Business for New Europe goes, with Lord Peter Mandelson and Roland Rudd, the same message invariably comes out.

Never backed up.  Never punitive.  Just ripples of the Business for New Europe official policy which roll out.

Dan Hannan called him, Rudd, out on it amongst other things, like their backing the Euro a decade ago.  Rudd replied.  He pointed out that it was Peter Mandelson and the closed down Business for Europe that was pro-Euro, not the new revitalised Business for New Europe.  He argued about the extent of Hannan's EU contraction claims.  Never once did he try to address or deny that he was behind the lobbying these heads of state commenting on the UKs EU status.  Hannan pushed it, Rudd's response wouldn't go near it.  He argued that the UKs success in limiting the EU budget was grounds to show that the UK could reform from within.  Grounds which Mr Rudd was more than a tad premature to claim, as the budget was extended retrospectively.

How am I biased when the topic is about the DUP? SF has literally nothing to do with the link that was posted.

As for voting SF in, there are people who see the British army and the RUC as the true aggressors in Northern Ireland and much like the way Americans use it, the word terrorist is wheeled out by big powers to label people they don't like as insane murderers.

People can vote for whoever they want and the fact that SF are the second largest party in the country shows that a lot of people support them and have faith in them.

Institutions of power have changed. Being the master of the information disseminated from the government, or the church, or whatever institution granted enormous influence over portions of the public who only had that one source of information, from that one authority. I suppose this really struck hardest with the printing press, the medium with which we still consume much of our political input.

I suspect (I have no figures to back this up) that a significant portion of misinformation in Britain comes from a complete disengagement with politics. If all you read is the Sun, and you just flick past the sensationalist headlines then the small amount of politics you are absorbing gives you only one perspective. That one perspective is seldom challenged, frequently reinforced and becomes fact to those who consume only one source of news.

I'm hopeful that as the internet continues to thrive in all its aspects of sharing and connectivity we will see a more well informed public. It is much harder to limit what is available online and the empathy that can be developed through these two key functions.

Empathy is important for engagement in my opinion. The internet is giving us greater means to share experiences, and as this well connected generation grows up my predicition is a more progressive (dare I hope for liberal?) focus in Western Europe, that will hopefully pour money into investing in our future (education, science, social science).

So I think that we are not far from really being able to take another leap in terms of education and information, we just need ten or fifteen years for people who have grown up in this digital age to find themselves in positions of power. I have no doubt it will take years of rambling, but we are on the right track.

true,jdsnape,null,null,"Regarding the streaming, it does depend on what internet connection you have. If you have infinity, then the BT Sport and any extra tv channels you pay for will get streamed (but not ordinary freeview channels like BBC 1 etc.) and you want the youview box. If you have copper internet (traditional ADSL) BT Sport will come over freeview and you will need the vision+ box with a viewing card. 

The live TV is streamed using something called multicast, which means that it's supposed to be more reliable than the traditional point to point streaming that things like iPlayer use - but it's not something I've used as I've not got infinity yet :( The on demand stuff (movies) is also streamed and works really well in my experience.

The other interesting point is you say Madrid are desperate...well, so are Arsenal kind of aren't they??

There's nobody else really available of Suarez quality at all and as we speak they are being humbled at home by Napoli (who have Huguain, a major target) at home in the Emirates cup. Not to mention the fans seem pretty disgruntled.

In this situation it is most definitely a sellers market, his contract and unwillingness to submit a transfer request point to that. There hasn't been a peep out of him since he joined back up with the club beyond silly speculation. For example BBCs story on him thinking about legal action yesterday which COINCIDENTALLY happened to come on the same day Suarez was mentioned by Wenger.

true,Thyrotoxic,cnty-wales,Not actually Welsh,"I have no problem with them doing this, if they want to support an anti-fracking protest that's fine. But this sentence annoys me, it's a blatant lie.

&gt;Lush describes fracking as “a threat to our water, a threat to our air” which uses “carcinogenic chemicals” and causes “unacceptable side effects”. 

Fracking in this country does not use ""carcinogenic chemicals"", Cuadrilla's fluid contains HCL, a biocide, polyacrlyamide and sodium salt. Not only that but it is 99.95 per cent water and sand. 

* HCl is non-toxic and is used in such minuscule amounts that it cannot possibly harm anything. 

* The [biocide](http://www.dow.com/microbial/pdfs/Glutaraldehyde_9012.pdf) in use is non-carcinogenic and is in standard use for water treatment and has been for the past 50 years. It is often used in cooling loops which are notoriously leaky.

* Polyacrylamide is used as a flocculant in water treament processes (including for drinking water) and is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic.

* Sodium salt is well sodium salt.

So far those are the only chemicals allowed to be used by the EA. [Cuadrilla](http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/what-we-do/hydraulic-fracturing/fracturing-fluid/) themselves have only used polyacrylamide (friction reducer) and sodium salt (tracer) in their fluid, biocides are unnecessary as the fluid is pre-treated and dilute HCL has not yet been used (it's often used before fracking commences to clear any debris in the borehole). 

There is a debate to be had on fracking but it harms your position when you spout complete lies. 

Edit:After checking the [chemical disclosure](http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Chemical-Disclosure-PH-1.jpg) form the fluid is 99.95 per cent water and sand (98 per cent water), not 99.95 per cent water.

It's just a difference you are able to identify which you're trying to use as an excuse for telling people the UK can't, or couldn't negotiate a similar deal.  Not only do we have a Norwegian development minister saying it won't be a problem, we had the likes celebrated French intellectuals like Maurice Druon, good friend and honourary knight of the UK, who openly argued that it would indeed be better for both France and the UK if the UK were afforded elevated partnership status outside of the EU.  A majority of French people polled in January 2013 were okay with it; 70% in one Le Figaro poll.  As were a majority of German people; 80% according to one German broadcaster.  What they don't want is the UK inside the EU and cherrypicking or braking further integration.   Not to force the UK out, but that they thought a decision would be best.  They want to give us a deal.  The ALDE and the Spinelli Group heard a key proponent of EU federalism addressed the group after Cameron's Europe speech, and without animosity, said that Federalism should be planned for without the UK.  There is no animosity being projected from an EU exit, even though most leaders say they don't want to see the UK leave.  A majority of French and German people aren't talking of punitive measures if the UK does leave, certainly their manufacturers don't want to lose custom, - but time and time again the establishment argues no UK cherry picking within the UK, and more integration, which the UK can't deliver on.

Opposite from what you seem to be arguing, the pro-Federalists/closer-integrationists are seen to be almost keen to throw the UK a juicy Brexit bone!   

Of course, we already have a signed EFTA treaty outside the EU, some contributions would have to be discussed but 'without prejudice' under agreed terms, so using comparable standards that would be around an 85% reduction in costs, but there's scope for it moving slightly in either direction - but this would be the guaranteed fallback from which legally guaranteed *negotiations* would start around.

When I brush away the scrub and grasses around the fear mongering surrounding this topic, it's not a position-eating EU tiger that is revealed but more a cute, inoffensive, amicable putty-cat of trade but no political union.

How can you study a subject thoroughly without covering both sides? There are always at least two sides.

How can you define what morality is, what you believe, what is right and wrong, if you've never had the opportunity to be exposed to it. Truly exposed to it, not sheltered away like children. Violence, hatred, bigotry, conflict, sex, humour, love, envy, all of it. You can't say what is right for certain until you have dismissed all that is wrong.You can't dismiss it without evidence. You can't acquire evidence if you can't access it.

As would placing KDB centre and Oscar right by switching them in your lineups.

As always, you can't only think about them going forward, I don't really see how much you change about it being backheely (which I presume you just mean close passing movement by adding KDB, if anything you'd want Schurrle for dribbling and longer shots to add variance.)

Whether it's true or not is another matter. Liverpool football club is not for sale but if someone came in and offered a billion they'd jump at it so by that logic all the owners can say is we have no intention of selling - but they don't, they say the club is not for sale.

Look at Levy, he has said it a number of times about Bale. He is not for sale - if it comes to it, fine, he'll be sold but he will be getting €100 mil for him. Luis Suarez by all accounts should not be for sale at any price - especially to Arsenal, a direct rival for 4th spot. 

If he is pushing for a move then they have already lied to us about him understanding the clubs position on not selling. Every player may have a price, but the price for us to sell without a doubt our best player to Arsenal should be totally out of reach for them. 

It's not tangible. What is practically cementing Arsenal's position in fourth spot this year worth to us in cash?

The ship's Lynx helicopter also engaged seven Iraqi warships.[1] She spent the longest period upthreat of any coalition warship. As a result of her endeavours, her captain (Commander Philip Wilcocks) and flight commander (Lt Cdr David Livingstone) were decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross; the operations officer and flight observer were both mentioned in Despatches.

true,Eatingatwix,null,null,"It is difficult to discuss this without falling into a thousand euphemisms, half of which which mean that with a web filter turned on (by default) content is accidentally blocked despite being innocuous in nature. 

The Filter's stated role is to mostly block stuff that would be considered to be [mature content](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/uk-internet-filter-block-more-than-porn_n_3670771.html?utm_hp_ref=world) (huffpost), so we're talking about anything that would likely get a film bumped from a 12 to a 15. This with the addition of some general moral disapproval and removal of ""dangerous ideas"" that are TBD.

If we skip away from the ""this will never work"" arguement for now because most filters are laughably simple to get past, and go to content being blocked ""unintentionally"" we can discuss the nature of ""approved"" or ""unapproved"" content.

The way I like to talk about this is to begin by saying the only truly 100% effective Filter is what is called a ""white list"" that contains a list of everything that has been judged to be acceptable, and excludes everything else. In order to be disseminated on the public internet every page requires approval of its most recent updated changes. 

That is not what is being proposed currently. What is being proposed is a system of rules, to be applied in a blanket across all existing web content. These rules will state that any content that falls outwith these rules is forbidden from view. This creates an awkward situation where the content is not there for you to know that it is being blocked. This is called a ""black list"" where content is removed from the collective when it is deemed to violate the rules.

QED the government now controls your internet experience. 

You can't find out what is not available through The Filter because The Filter stops you from searching for that content. So through unitentional or incompetant systems and personnel the government has total say over what you have the capacity to view. This is not to say it is a malicious action (although it will be, it always is eventually in my opinion) or even with malicious intent, but the consequence of letting the government decide the parameters of the rules means that anyone under The Filter is already having their experience dictated. 

This Filter is there to block LEGAL content. Illegal content is already covered by law in most cases, the Filter is a social project, not safety.  

The steps from where we are now to where we could end up relies a bit on [nudge theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) (sometimes called political creep). The idea that small political changes, additions or subtractions to the law can go unnoticed or accepted by the public in order to achieve a greater goal. This theory is fairly ubiquitus, most laws that are passed in the UK are the first stage of something, the basepoint to jump from to reach your next goal. Movements are made of this theory, you go for what you can now, in the hopes that it will make what you want to get much easier in the future.

So the steps are:

1) Establish idea of Filter, get the conservative majority in England to go along with it by campaigning in tabloids.  
2) Bully ISPs into supporting the idea with threats of new legislation and branding business as ""immoral"" for opposing The Filter.  
3) Can go several ways or in stages but basically these three in any order:  
     A) Activate ""opt-out"" filtering on majority of UK services, compliance non-mandatory.  
     B) Likely rise in popularity of non-filtering ISPs.  
     C) Likely legislation, to require the opt-out register to be mandatory for all UK ISPs.  
4) System proves to be a complete and utter disaster. Although this effect will be low key, because that's what we're like.  
5) It is decided that the system requires repair rather than scrapping.
  
This is where we talk about how likely this is to fail, and there are several real world examples of internet filters that I will link to at the end that demonstrate this quite nicely. Firstly, as I stated earlier, most current generation web filters are so unsophisticated that a proxy can get around them easily, so easily any 12 year old could accomplish it. The result is parents assuming their children are safe on the internet and further backing away from their resposibiltiy of supervision and discussion, when in fact these children still have access to this content, but now their parents minds' are at ease becuase they don't have to engage with them about these difficult subjects.

That is to tackle the justification for this project. The ""unintended"" consequences and shortcomings of this filter are well known and admitted by everyone who supports them. Websites are blocked where there is no infringing content. 

How will they know they are blocked? When google stops linking to them because a hardware shop sells ""latex bonding fluid"" and their whole online business suffers? Or a twenty something, who uses the internet to check her emails and go on facebook, unfamiliar with The Filter, she cannot find motivational websites to help cure her anorexia. Articles about taboo subjects blocked by generic words. Forums that share explicit materials alongside other content become blocked entirely.

To whom will these failures be reported? Do you think there is a phonebank or email inbox in the world that could handle the requests of every site the Filter fails? What of those that go unreported? Their legal content is blocked by the government for reasons as benign as incompetancy or as malicious as targeted blocks, and no one on the Filter can access is ever again!

So we have a filter that is ridiculously easy to bypass by the computer semi-literate, that blocks the wrong materials as a ""cost"" of blocking the correct stuff.

Only it won't do that either. Do you expect to see The Sun or The Mail blocked from your screens? Not a chance. Their websites are covered in exposed breasts and language like ""all grown up"" surrounding their celebrity sections. O2 amongst many other UK mobile internet networks filter adult content by default, you need only google a bad word to see if it blocks every undesireable result.

There lies the hypocrisy. This is already a subjective Filter. It would be implimented WITH partisan and political filtering already, as a jumping off point. What is acceptable now will change, and the filter will need to change too, it will never be able to adapt fast enough in its current black list form.  

So what does the government do with this Filter that has proven to be so inneffective at preventing children from being exposed to mature content, has led to disengagement between parents and children around internet safety, has blocked useful sites and failed to filter pornography anyway?

Scrap it or take it further? Whoever is in power will get to decide that, do you really want to trust better behaviour to some future authority? The fear is entriely justifiable.  

[Australian Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Australia) - Our own adventure reflected back with fun accents.

[Danish Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Denmark) - Now with full political creep!

[Countires with internet censorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_by_country) - Quite a group we'd be joining.  




All of that said I do actually believe that even if this should be implemented the nudge that is working through liberal politics at the moment is towards internet freedom. I believe we in the West will likely see a greater drive in the progressive movement as those born in the digital generation come of age.

The overall solution is obviously education.

I've definitely factored in their need to track back. I see Hazard and KDB as having much higher defensive work rates than Mata. So, I want them on the wings to track back and help in those spaces behind the 3 AM's and to the side of the band of 2, where I think the 4231 leaves us vulnerable.

Forget backheely. I mean they lack direct attacking and sometimes get too careless with the ball as part of their high finesse interplay. I see Moses, Schurrle, and KDB as best on the wings. They'll make the decision to take it down to the byline occasionally and whip it in for our monster, Lukaku, to put in. Whereas 99% of Mazacar's attacks come through the center. Teams way beneath us were giving us trouble because they simply loaded the box.

Also, you say it's anti-social. For the most part, this is bollocks. If you go to a football match, you will sit next to complete strangers and talk to them, because you all have something in common.

McCormack was just as hard-working as tenacious as always, epitomised when he sprinted the length of the field for a Brighton break in about the 89th minute to cover for Drury at left back who was nowhere to be seen. Also his goal. Yeah, that.

The only player I was really unimpressed with was Peltier who seemed to want to smack the ball up the field any chance he got despite having options around him.

true,Thyrotoxic,cnty-wales,Not actually Welsh,"Regulations in short. The US has very basic regulations and no well inspection teams to ensure the integrity of the well casing. Thanks to the US political system there's always going to be arguments about federal and state regulations so different areas have different standards.

Methane in tap water does occur naturally in some areas and it is not toxic, there is a potential explosion hazard if the gas reaches a certain concentration but that is extremely unlikely. 

Whilst a flashy thing for the anti-fracking people to rally around burning tap water isn't really the main cause for concern. What most people are actually worried about is the fluid itself (the composition of which is not released to the public) contaminating water supplies. In the US it's kind of controversial whether this has or hasn't happened, I'm not particularly well versed on what is happening in the US but I believe some studies have said yes and some studies have said no. The US fracking companies are acting very suspiciously though, often settling out of court with a confidentiality clause to any suits made against them.

There are three ways contamination could happen:

* Through the well casing if it has failed above the impermeable rock layer

* Through fractures which propagate through the impermeable layer into an aquifer

* Through spills on the surface

The UK has mitigate these three risks thoroughly. 

* Wells casing design must be approved by regulators before use, well casing must also be inspected by well inspection teams (similar to what is already used in the North Sea) before any fracking can start. In any incident where the casing integrity could possibly be breached, such as minor earthquakes such as happened in Balcombe in 2011, all processes must be ceased and the casing be reinspected for damage.

* The depths which drilling is taking place is far below the impermeable layer and fractures are highly unlikely to be able to reach the layer. The largest fracture found is around 600m in length, only one per cent are more than 300m. In the small chance that a fracture does penetrate the impermeable layer and enter an aquifer fluid flow upwards will not happen thanks to the immense pressures under the Earth. 

* An impermeable geo-membrane layer must be installed under the surface of the pad to ensure any spills do not affect the soil and any water reserves below. It's the same technology to ensure landfill leachate does not contaminate water supplies. 

I highly recommend you read the [Royal Society's](http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/projects/shale-gas/2012-06-28-Shale-gas.pdf) report on fracking in the UK. It's quite long  but is very easy to read even as a layman. If you can't be arsed to read that (I wouldn't blame you if you didn't) then the Royal Society has summarised its recommendations to the government when it comes to fracking [here](http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/).

Italy have huge problems with football violence. So yeah, I'm not gonna argue with that. They obviously have a lot of fans who still operate with that tribal mindset, for whatever reason, which is awful. Things are undoubtedly more congenial over here.

Funnily enough, football fans at international games often sit with opposing fans, and things seem to work out well enough. For example [here's some Irish fans singing and sitting with Spanish fans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZqpYX9eNk), and [here's some Dutch and Scottish fans applauding each other after a game.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n4AgRQVJ3k) 

I'm just sick of people treating football as the devil and adopting such a holier than thou attitude. I'm not denying there are serious problems with elements of the fan-base in this country, but outside of the fierce derby games (like Westham v Millwall) most fans see football violence for what it is. There are horrible violent people in all walks of life - but I doubt (for example) that people who attend protests with the aim of peacefully expressing their views appreciate being lumped in with the fucktards who just want to vandalise stuff and fight police. So why do the same with football fans? That was what I really took issue with.

If there's no evidence, she won't be prosecuted at all. 

Your examples were prosecuted for the words themselves, not an act. Their crime was what they said, they were guilty of posting a ""public electronic message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character contrary to the Communications Act 2003"". 

For instance, I couldn't be prosecuted for saying ""I punched a muslim in the face!"" because without any evidence it's considered ""internet bravado"". Without an actual victim they can't prosecute me for the crime of assault.  

However, if I said ""All muslims should be punched in the face!"" there's no assault charge, but it is incitement. The crime is publishing the words.

Burton's keeper had a shocker of a game today. At fault for both goals, first one was embarrassing as he completely misjudged the bounce of the ball to allow Cureton to tap it in, and for the second one he palmed a shot straight into the path of Harrison to stroke home. The players picked up that he was dodgy and took a few shots from 30-35 yards out because of this.

The goals we conceded were rather sloppy, the second coming from a corner which should have been dealt with. Sam Deering hit the crossbar with a great curling shot with 5 minutes to go, but we couldn't get a winner.

There are though, every team above division 3 has a firm, that firm wants to fight other firms. Fairly simple stuff.

&gt;I'm not lying to you or trying to deceive you mate. This is just how I see it, as someone who is a match going football fan.

You can see it whichever way you like, there has been a history of violence from football fans and there still is, not as much as there was but there still is.

It's like saying right wing violence isn't as bad as it was in the 80's with the NF or C18 etc, of course it isn't but there is still an unacceptable level of it.

Trucks are already on the road filled with far more dangerous chemicals than in use in fracking. A road tanker filled with petrol is far more dangerous than a road tanker filled with HCl for instance. 

Waste processing and disposal, again the trucks are filled with mainly water and possibly extremely dilute HCl is the most dangerous thing. It's so dilute it'd be safe to drink.

Secondary pollution is a part of any industrial process, the Royal Society have stated that rather than flaring excess gas it should be captured, the US EPA has already stated that this should be used in all fracking operations by 2015 and there's no reason is shouldn't be used here. Also that fourth one has nothing to do with aquifer contamination, which is what I was talking about. 

From my own source:

&gt;Fracturing of the Bowland
Shale (Cuadrilla’s target for shale gas extraction
in Lancashire) took place at depths of 1700m and
3100m. Extracting shale gas from much shallower
shales is unlikely since reservoir pressures would be
too low for gas to flow at commercial rates. 


That second quote is talking about migration of gas in the shale formations themselves. They cannot migrate through the impermeable layer above the shale as it is, by definition, impermeable. The only way that could happen is if fractures propagated through the impermeable layer which is unlikely. Even if it did happen upward fluid flow will not happen.

&gt;The very unlikely event of fractures propagating
all the way to overlying aquifers would provide a
possible route for fracture fluids to flow. However,
suitable pressure and permeability conditions would
also be necessary for fluids to flow (Younger 2007).
Sufficiently high upward pressures would be required
during the fracturing process and then sustained
afterwards over the long term once the fracturing
process had ceased. It is very difficult to conceive
of how this might occur given the UK’s shale gas
hydrogeological environments. Even if this were the
case, the permeability of the fractures would still
need to be similar to that of the overlying aquifer
for any significant quantity of fluid to flow. In reality,
the permeability of the aquifer is likely to be several
orders of magnitude greater than the permeability of
the fractures. Upward flow of fluids from the zone of
shale gas extraction to overlying aquifers via fractures
in the intervening strata is highly unlikely",0,1375559818,null,0,false,0,cbgayea,t3_1jmooa,t1_cbgayea,t1_cbgar7r,null,1429956770,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Don't trust Traoré in defense. Not sure what his starting means - is he off or not? Suppose Yun will start against Exeter.

""The Liverpool triples salary Diego Costa
Jorge Mendes has been offering the player in the Premier and his only clause is 25 million euros

Liverpool's offer for Diego Costa is serious, very serious. The figures prove, are indisputable. And is that the English have offered the Brazilian triple the salary he receives currently at Atletico. In just over a million euros that would currently charges to pocket about 4 kilos net per course.

The difference in view is, is more than substantial and therein lies the main reason that it is forward thinking. Bring actually several months pondering the possibility of a change.

Costa, despite this statement, is happy living in Madrid, in Spain, which does not preclude consideration economically undervalued compared to most of their peers. Despite its status as a reference, this is the Atletico players with the lowest payroll, which does not correspond to its performance on the grass, where it should be like at least, add and subtract zeroes to the contract.

Community Being an advantage
Your passport, which it is, playing for his departure today. It was one of the conditions required to sign for any European club and already have in weeks, when he swore the Spanish Constitution after six years of living in our country (came in 2007 signed by Garcia Pitarch).

A Costa, and this is vital to understand the current situation, it is Jorge Mendes, the most powerful agent of the moment. The same as achieved what seemed impossible, Radamel Falcao forget about the League, to play the Champions League, and embark on the adventure, questionable at best, to defend the elastic Monaco least a championship level as French.

In recent months, Mendes has dropped in England, where it is also very well connected, the player would be willing to move out. His performances, especially his goal against Real Madrid in the final of the Copa del Rey, was placed on the first line media, which is vital for teams like Liverpool, the previous offer had come from the Arsenal-consider the possibility to pay the 25 million euros of its clause. This point, in any case, is still performed.

A figure that, seeing what is being paid for front and Cavani or Higuain this summer, it seems out of the market by any means. The fact that only two years detract contract-its link with Atletico ends in 2015 - also plays for his possible departure this summer.

Everything is, at this time, in the hands of the player. This is recognized in the offices of Calderon, where they know that if Liverpool or any other entity comes to the amount of the clause depends on its output Diego Costa of Atletico or not.""",0,1375560598,null,0,false,0,cbgb6a9,t3_1jn2wq,t1_cbgb6a9,t1_cbgav06,null,1429956668,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

When it's unsafe to brake in time or they just didn't see the lights, sure. But many (most) cyclists will mount the pavement to skip the lights or they'll just sail straight through if they have a clear run.

Yes. And I have no problem with any of these things. Light timings are set to compensate for ""amber-gamblers"", and stop lines are arbitrary. If they aren't obstructing the crossing then I don't care.

&gt;have you ever see cars parked on pavements, or blocking cycle lanes...how do you suppose they get there?

Parking on the pavement is not the same as slaloming between pedestrians just to save a few seconds of your commute.

you think?...im 38, one of the chaps I knew was a friend at school...that would have been about 25 year ago. In that time an average of 1800 die on the roads a year. So that's 45000 deaths. Do you really think its a statistical anomaly for one person could be connected to 3 deaths on the road in that time?

&gt;I live on one.

that's interesting...I used to live on one to, down in Bournemouth and every Friday night we used to watch cars cut though to get to the road on the other side. 

But its good that on your particular road it does not happen much. 

&gt;I drove for 15 years

wow, all those speed cameras, speed bumps etc must confuse the hell out of you if you've not seen any cars break rules in that time. 

&gt;Yes. And I have no problem with any of these things

well there we go. One rule for you and another for everyone else. 

&gt;stop lines are arbitrary

ummmm...No...stop lines have a purpose. Its not open to interpretation. If you jumped a stop line in your driving exam you would be marked down for it or fail because of it.



&gt;or they just didn't see the lights

Then they are not paying attention.

&gt;Parking on the pavement is not the same as slaloming between pedestrians just to save a few seconds of your commute.

Your right, its a different type of anti social behavior that stops access for everyone, esp the blind and wheelchair bound. Also...Do you know the figures for pedestrians killed by cars mounting the pavement vs cyclists mounting the pavement? You might want to have a look into it.

BUT, teams will then close that down, because they have time usually, so then we bring it back and switch it to the other side. But its our one touch passing in tight space in the midfield that is a read trade mark now.

Edit: the one touch passing out of congested areas usually happens after stealing the ball. Once the ball is stolen, more then one player will crash on the ball which opens up our one touch alleys. We did that a lot in the game today. Also, another good example was the one from this past season on the right wing just behind midfield line against wigan. The one where wisdom (might have been kelly), and the others did awesome one touch that found Suso open who drove on the dwindled defense, laid it off to assaidi, who then played it across for Sahin to score.

There is a Jedi Religion based off of Star Wars and is indeed classified as a ""religion"" in the ways it seems like you categorize a proper religion rather than a personal belief. So by that logic Doctor Who could just as easily become a proper religion. 

Nearly every proper religion got it start with a small group of people who shared a common belief, value system, etc. that grew over time. 

Religion is a nebulas concept at best. I could go out and create my very own Doctor Who religion, and would most likely gain followers (not many at first, if ever) but followers none the less (indeed there is already a doctor who religion FB group) so if a religion only need be a group rather than an individual who share similar beliefs and agree it is a religion then it is in fact already a religion.

First of all, this statement isn't even true. You honestly can't ignore Rafa's affect on Torres' form. His goalscoring definitely improved toward the end of the season, and most objective observers (of which neither you or I qualify) were able to admit that Torres had indeed improved near the end of the season. 

Second of all, of the managers you listed, only Ancelotti and Rafa are top class managers (all due respect to RDM, whom we all love). And I'm sure many on this sub would argue against Rafa. Ancelotti had the tough act of juggling Torres and Drogba in a system suited far more for the latter. At the end of the day, there is plenty of reason to believe Jose could in fact get more out of Torres. He's renown to be a master motivator, and as we all know, Torres could use confidence perhaps more than any other player in the squad. Regardless, I find it quite rational and reasonable for fans to believe Jose can improve Torres.

I'm basically implying that not all actions on the road are or should be equal. The fine (punishment) needs to fit the crime.

If jumping red lights kills no one (other then the cyclist occasionally) then it should not be held in the same level as car drivers who do similar things (around 40 deaths a year as a result I think).

You also have to factor in other issues regarding cycling on the pavement and red light jumping. Some (not all, I would never claim all) do so because road infrastructure/and some driver attitude is dangerous. And the safest place is off the road, or in the case of traffic lights getting a head start on the cars behind you is also a benefit to the cyclist.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt;This one is my favourite.

I love it too. But with an hourglass figure? She's rather skinny. 

&gt;This one I think it needs a glow on the skin as opposed to pale skin.

Could makeup fix it? I'd probably go for some dramatic gold eyes and pale lipstick with it. 

&gt;Not a fan of this one

Have a look again at the catwalk video. It shows more potential there.

&gt;I like the kimono sleeve on this It is a nice colour but I am concerned it could overpower you if you are too pale.

I have a dress in this exact colour and it suits me well, however, it is much more more fitted. I could end up looking like an elephant in that dress. I think I'll avoid. 

&gt;Holy redness It is a lovely style, I would prefer it in navy or even grey

I'm trying to get away from a work wardrobe with so much black and grey in it. I recently bought an amazing red dress, but it's in a completely different style and a darker red. I'm not sure if that shade of red would suit me. 

&gt;I like this, I understand about the exposed zip, that's a bit foolish of them. Maybe something for winter with a light cardigan.

I have a red cashmere cardigan to match the belt perfectly. 

&gt;I like this, it's a little different because of the side bits but still conveys prefessionalism.

I'm still on the fence with it, not sure. 

&gt;I don't like this, the shoulders are not good on the dress, I might also be concerned if you have bigger boobs than the model.

Yes, much bigger. Eww, I've just noticed the lines down the front of the dress. They will *not* suit me.

&gt;The shoes are lovely, definitely worth investing in I think.

They're gorgeous aren't they? I've been looking for pretty much this in black or nude for interview shoes forever. My trusty Geigers are just starting to fall apart and I'm really upset. If you happen to come across such a thing, please do let me know!

Also, I just asked a woman in Tesco where she got her lovely dress from and she reminded me that [Cos](http://www.cosstores.com/Shop/Women/Dresses) exists. Their website never does their [dresses](http://www.cosstores.com/Shop/Women/Dresses/Belted_side_drape_dress/46881-867427.1#c-2926612) justice. They have some lovely, lovely things.

Worner was a very safe pair of hands. Catching every cross he came for and then smothering the ball on the deck, a couple of acrobatic tips over the bar too. His kicking however, very ropey! But in his defence twice he shouted away and pointed to stick it out for a throw and still was given a ball he didn't want.


Smith looked ok. He had a one on one early in the game which the keeper saved but it was down the other end so I can't say if he should of done better or not. Other then that he didn't get much as they had the majority of possession until our triple substitution when he was replaced by Midson. The subs paid off and injected some 'omphf' to the proceedings.


Pell's goal went in off the defender's head, good strike though.

Chris Arthur looked promising when he came on, *properly* fast! At one point he picked the ball up on the edge of our box and just screamed past 3 of their players down the wing but his cross nearly cleard the stand behind the goal!

&gt;* Yes, Real Madrid are in the pole position for Gareth Bale's signature.

&gt;* Gareth has attracted attention from many teams, but Real Madrid is certainly one of them.

&gt;* I won't be commenting on transfer stories today, sorry.

&gt;* **Rumors are rumors, I think that's pretty evident here.**

&gt;    Additional comments: ""No.""

&gt;Reporter asks, ""Real Madrid have been linked with Gareth Bale for some time now and reports suggest that the transfer will be completed. Will it be tough to lose someone like Gareth?

&gt;* Absolutely, Gareth is a world class player and he will be missed.

&gt;* I think so, he is a quality player, but it's a team sport so we will have the personnel necessary to fill his absence.

&gt;* I don't have anything to say about this transfer story.

&gt;* While Gareth is a good player, he is replaceable and the team will kick on without a doubt.

&gt;* Gareth is expendable, and the funds from this transfer will help our club achieve great things.

To me he was always a bit of a scally with a major case of small man syndrome. He was never in major trouble, but he hung around with the scally / chavvy groups in school, and got in to scraps and scrapes now and again, but nothing to write home about.

In the school football team he played defense mainly. Our team at the time were half decent as we had him, Jonny Pringle who also played for Liverpool's academy and Ste Anderson who played for Everton youth (until he had a career ending injury at 16). To be honest, he never really stood out in the team for me, maybe that's because I was playing too and was concentrating on my game or maybe that's why I'm not cut out to be a football scout too!

When he was about 15/16 ish he broke his leg, and I remember him being gutted that he thought Liverpool would toss him out with the trash, but they've stuck by him.

There are any number of different types of frac's which are appropriate for different formations and situations of which a sub section of those 260 will be used. 

What Thyrotoxic listed above is known to be a slickwater frac which is the style of treatment that unlocked the Barnett Shale and the subsequent shale gas ""revolution"" and is a common starting point now for shale gas plays but requires the formation to have certain characteristics. should the shale that crudilla (sp?) turn out to be suitable to this style of fracturing then that is likely to be about as complicated as it gets. The volumes, stages and sand loading will likely go up as what will be pumped now are exploration amounts i.e. enough to get gas to surface but not so large and therefore expensive.

The other chemicals listed maybe applicable to any number of different style frac such as  gel, hybrid, foam, energized, which maybe be only applicable to other style of formations such as Tight Gas which will not be found on onshore UK.

Be it the NHS, the work programme or the numerous other pies A4E and G4S have their grubby little fingers in.

Money gets wasted by those in shirts, sitting behind a desk and the end result is piss poor patient care. 

I won't go into too much detail because I like the little bit of privacy I have, but I worked for a hospital that had one chief executive resign after overseeing a major fuckup in a particular departments spending to then be replaced by a chief executive that raked in a shed load of money as an interim chief executive, to be then given the job full time. The second chief executive jumped ship from two other hospitals. The first one sanctioned a former army officer to be paid thousands per week to ""find out what went wrong so we can learn from it"".

At the same time as this was going on, redundancies were happening and indeed my job was one of those facing the chop, regardless of the fact that my sole purpose was to save them money. Even I can only defend the NHS upto a point. That point starts and stops with the thousand of health care professionals who are selfless in their work. Beyond that, you have a load of monkeys running amok without a fucking clue.

Privatising any hospital would see them cherry-picking the profit making services and getting rid of others. The end result would be having to look much further afield to receive treatments.

Now look at Liverpool. If they keep Suarez then their 2013/14 team will be a better squad than 2012/13. 

However it's looking very unlikely that Suarez will stay at Liverpool at the moment. If Suarez does leave you will either be as good as in 2012/13 or worse. You can't argue with that.

Therefore if Suarez Leaves (not saying he'll join Arsenal): 

Arsenal 2012/13 team w/ 73 points has a certainty of not declining in 2013/14.

Liverpool 2012/13 team w/ 61 points has an almost certainty of not improving in 2013/14.

If you think a Liverpool team without Suarez will be a better squad than with Suarez then frankly you're wrong.

Men are something like 20 times more likely to be convicted of murder in the UK than women. But does this mean that, in a murder investigation, it would be appropriate to go out and arrest all men in the area for questioning? No. Because that is far too speculative, you need a reasonable suspicion.

Just because group A is more likely to be breaking the law than group B doesn't mean that you should target people of group A; you should target people you have some real reason to believe are actually breaking the law, not just statistical data.

The other reason why focusing on non-white people is bad is because it's *illegal*. It may be supported by statistics, it may be that every non-white person in the area turned out to be an illegal immigrant, but it doesn't matter; the police and immigration authorities shouldn't be allowed to break the law.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Oscar being bullied off the ball, you must be joking. Oscar is deceptively strong on the ball, not so much whilst dribbling, Hazard is much stronger whilst dribbling. Maybe that's what you mean. But in terms of being able to hold it up and play through balls for others Oscar has the edge, especially defensively. Which makes sense to have him central. To link up more with the midfielders and have wingers which are capable of pushing forward.

Oscar is far more capable of breaking up attacks early in their formation, enabling a faster counter, already in their half. Allowing Hazard to break easily. Mata would be able to cut infront of Oscar whilst opening space for him to move wide in transition or to slow down the game again. At the moment Mata actually marks players marginally better than Hazard. For that he is perhaps better suited to the wing because it's more important to slow the play rather than having to break it up. Basically just sticking with the opposing full back.

Ok, fair enough, you think KDB could be a good winger. I think he's best on the left, which is where I'd rather have Hazard. I'd like mata cutting in and playing reverse passes. Also it would be interesting what his genius can conjure from the byline. The defensive formation we went to when recovering the ball was 4-4-1-1 with mata the AM. If this is to continue I can't really see KDB as one of the more defensive wingers, I'd rather use Ramires or Moses.

As for you wanting direct attacking, the second lineup has more direct attacking. Changing KDB for Oscar doesn't really change that dynamic much. The most direct attacker is still by far Hazard. Schurrle on the left, hazard on the right and oscar in the middle would be my preferred most direct wingers. The problem with your two line ups seems to me that they  are relatively easily compromised. If we play a team with 2 deep holding midfielders or 1 DM and an advanced CB we would get more easily picked apart on the slow build up attacks of Mata, Oscar, KDB (and to an extent Lampard and Van Ginkel due to their movement). The direct play where we take teams apart on the counter and by removing players from the play by taking it past them is most effectively done by Hazard, Schurrle and somewhat decently by Moses. Mata is sort of capable of neutralising one defender with a piece of skill but we seem to have stopped him doing this in favour of retaining possession as much as possible.

Basically, the problem I see with your lineups is one of balance. Hazard, Mata and KDB doesn't seem well balanced at all IMO. None of them can mark very well whatsoever. None of them can actually challenge for the ball particularly well, at least not proven to in the Prem. Everything you could argue KDB can do, Oscar can do just as well if not better. Mata is more suited out wide unless you have 2 out and out DM rather than 1DM and 1 CM essentially.

One of the problems with the high finesse interplay is actually not making the pitch small enough. We need to minimise the area these players work in by pushing the full backs high and the wingers all in together. (Just to clarify, both full backs pushed up at the same time, whilst having 1 or 2 holders ahead of the CBs). This forces congestion in the middle and allows pressure to farmed out to the flanks to cross for Lukaku via the full backs. It's basically what the Spanish teams have been doing for years. Otherwise we need to be far more tactful with our mentality and lineup I agree, the tight interplay isn't always a guaranteed way to the goal. I think a balanced lineup is the easiest way to create a team that can counter and play possession. And that's got to be our aim. I mean that's exactly what Bayern are capable of.

true,Amonette2012,blue,Cotham,"I've rented mostly in Redland and Cotham, I pay 350 a month minus bills for a big room but it's a pretty good deal. Around here I'd say 3-450 is the general range. You can get nice places a little cheaper in the Gloucester Road area, Bedminster and Montpelier. Try Bristol Gumtree for rooms.

Biking around the city is a good way to do it if you don't mind the hills, public transport can be pricey. A day ticket is £4, singles can be anywhere from £1.70 to £3ish. I have a friend who works for a charity in Bath that restores bikes, so I can put you in touch once you move here if you don't mind a trip to bath. They're not crazy cheap, more custom rebuilds, but with the hills here it's worth having a well built bike. http://bath-bike-workshop.org.uk/ I tend to just walk everywhere.

Jobs... this city has two universities, so there's a lot of competition for casual jobs, but if you're persistent and keep your eyes open, and if you're around during university holidays you should find something. We have a lot of bars.

Re guitar playing - yeah a lot of people busk, but I wouldn't expect a massive amount of change. Not sure about the police reaction but you can ask them directly about busking, just look for an enquiries section on the Avon and Somerset police website.

Yes, again look at Bristol Gumtree and also meetup.com for these.

Used bookstores... there's a good one in St Nicholas market, there are often people selling books along the waterfront at weekends and there is a reasonable oxfam book shop (as well as several other charity shops that sell books) on Cotham Hill (which is a lovely area to live around as well). 

Favourite spots... Brandon Hill, usually with a Rocatillo's milkshake, Deco Lounge on Cotham Hill for breakfast (it's a chain, there are a few other Lounges across the city), The Hatchet pub behind the hippodrome and the Highbury vaults on St Michael's Hill, the Downs, St Nicholas market (especially at Christmas).

Spurs currently have Jason Burt who in June got Paulinho before anyone else, that AVB would snub PSG, reported our interest in Lamela before Baldini was even signed, and at the beginning of July that we had no interest in selling Bale.  

This article (like you said) isn't definitive proof of anything but seems to be part of a larger response from Spurs. I get the feeling that this was intended to be part of our media response....AVB addresses the Bale situation at the presser and Burt puts out an article saying we don't like how Real are handling things. 

Its a pointed and calculated response to all of the media hype around this.  We continue to come across as the reasonable side of the story we also continue to become the little guys standing up to Real.  I am hoping that AVB's presser and this signal a change from us where we start pushing back on the media blitz.

I'm really looking forward to seeing them again when they support Nine Inch Nails later this month. In honesty, I've not seen them since they had just replaced their guitarist, Tony, with some new guy. That was New years eve in the Roisin Dubh in Galway, 2012(?) 

They were underwhelming that night, especially compared to the last time I'd seen them in the same venue when Tony was still playing for them - a gig that was easily the best ASIWYFA gig I've been to. That gig was legendary. Then again, that new guy was still getting to grips with the song. He did butcher this one though - I hope he doesn't do it again later this month!

Either way, this song pretty much sums up, for me, my twenties in Belfast. It's such a beautiful song, and ASIWYFA sum up such a great attitude, of solidarity, away from all the misery of the old neanderthal duffers moaning about the troubles and sectarianism. There's plenty of people look forward, if you look for them beyond the rioters.

When we got him I was beyond ecstatic for my favorite player coming to my favorite club. Now I feel like a scorned ex-lover. I hate the move because a big reason I always loved Deuce is how he was generally respected throughout Europe for his play and that was big for me to have an American player in the EPL that garnered respect. While Donovan has probably always been better unlike him Deuce brought respect for American players abroad and now he's coming back to MLS and I kind of feel like he's just giving up and settling for the money.

If was a vision by several self-appointed clever people explaining why we wouldn't need cities in a wired age; people could go where they like, do what they like; they were free!

Of course it was bollocks.  In a digital economy (which as well as modern technology companies, you can also include modern publishing and finance), you don't need large amounts of space (to build a factory/printing press); you don't need raw materials; you don't need pastures for your flock; you need people.  And where do people live: cities.

So yes, the hyper concentration of London is inevitable.  But there's still things people can/should be doing to alleviate this, but the Government/popular opinion is against it as we're clinging to the ideal of a rural Britain.

1.  It needs to allow other cities to grow naturally.  No artificial ""we'll move a government department that everyone hates"" bullshit.  Too many times Central Government has interfered with the regions, give them autonomy.

2.  Green belt.  It was created in an age of massive urban sprawl, but it's too tight; the idea that green fields can never be used for housing is ridiculous, and expressly damaging to the economic/cultural wellbeing of this nation.  There still needs to be some planning, obviously, but things are far too conservative as things stand.

3.  Transport.  Crossrail is only the beginning.  There are many outer-suburbs of London which are more than an hour from Central London; you can commute faster from Norwich.  Let's open places up.

I am not saying, he is very good at it. Sadly, with essien's current fitness record, he is our only option. If we buy de-rossi and sell Mikel, it will be a definite step-up, but same can be said about essien too. Mikel is really good for a team challenging for league. But to be part of elite, we need better players in his position (just like most positions including striker, centre backs, left back). Let us just say, our ambition are now way higher than earlier, hence Mikel feels like a bottleneck for us; but he is definitely comparable to essien.

I don't care about roles of strikers though. Just thought it is worth mentioning that we have strikers to work in both systems. Unlike last time, when we simply had 1 striker like the ring in LotR. Only missing thing is a Rooney style striker to link up with Mazacar (or any other combination of a creative trio). 

As of today, I believe Mourinho will work with a moving formation, as a combination of both 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3. Starting formation and play style though will decide on Torres getting back to form.

Kinder Bueno, especially the white ones. 

Time out bars, another good chocolate hit but don't see them that often now. Same applies with Drifter bars, they are much forgotten and misunderstood. 

Mars, Snickers, Double Deckers, Boost etc are all good for a bit of variety.

58 - Ivanovic &amp; Terry

It would appear as if the statistics don't lie.

This means there are lots of students in the city. 

The night life is quite varied, there are lots of standard clubs that cater to students, cheap drinks, crap music.
There is also plenty of cool pubs and bars that put on bands, and some decent gig venues. Although to be fair you will find this in any student city.

Bristol does have probably the best electronic/dubsteb scene outside London. With the nightclub Motion regularly putting on dubstep nights. If you like doing MDMA then this is the place to go. Others might correct me here though, I'm not massively into music.

Ha!, you've bought into the marketing, hard! ;-)  Personally, all the mission groups seem pretty petty to me - Russell, [1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Group), [University Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Alliance), [GuldHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_HE) _and_  [Million+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million%2B).  They're like gangs in a playground which kids hang around with so they don't get the crap beaten out of them.

Edit:  Someone (I know who, but since they deleted their comment I won't mention their username) argued that the Russell group might not be better in terms of undergrad courses, but they are better for research since they're the research universities, whereas the 1994 group are ex polys.  I'd already typed a reply before they deleted it, so I might as well post it as an edit -

No, the Russell Group was originally conceived as comprising the larger research-heavy universities, whereas 1994 was set up to represent the small research-heavy universities - except increasingly that's no longer the case, because universities are growing fast.  Some of the research carried out at 1994 group universities is better quality than that at some of the Russell group - it depends on the department, staff, particular research group, speciality, funding and many other factors.",0,1375612691,null,0,1375697761,0,cbgnhwd,t3_1jo3zd,t1_cbgnhwd,t1_cbgmmh2,null,1429950776,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Of the players you listed, Ibe won't be playing that much as he is so young.

That brings it down to 6 first-team players fighting for 3 spots, and lets not forget that Coutinho can operate just as well as a central attacking midfielder, which fills the quota for a skilled central player that you think we lack.

true,sanchopanza,null,null,"&gt; why do so many cyclists still insist on cycling in the road? 

* You think roads are lumpy? Try a cycle path.
* Cycle paths stop and start every few hundred yards. There isn't a true cycle-path network in Britain.
* You never see an ""end of route"" sign on a road but cycle paths frequently have them.
* Similarly, motorists are never told to get out and push but cyclists are often told to dismount.
* On a cycle path, you have to give way *everywhere* - driveways crossing the cycle path, joining roads, etc.
* People with dogs, children and buggies - they don't want us and we don't want them. (Most cycle paths are shared use, or treated as though they are.)
* People park their cars in cycle lanes, all the time.
* They remove cyclists from the natural field of vision of motorists, often right at the side of the road.
* Use of cycle paths is optional - says so in the Highway Code. We might as well argue that motorists should always use the motorway.
* Cars are supposed to overtake bikes with between 3-6 feet to spare (depends who you ask; the Highway Code says ""the space you'd give to a small car"" or something equally vague). But if I'm in a cycle path in the gutter, cars pass me about 18"" from my shoulder, thinking they don't have to afford me any more space. This is called ""magic paint"".

Personally I use cycle paths when they are available and when they are useful. At other times, I don't. Sometimes, it's a question of personal safety and there are some cycle lanes I actively avoid.

Eriksen has great vision and attacking ability, but struggles defensivly and would not be a good fit along Lucas like how Stevie has adapted. Only fit i could see is if we played a 4231 with Eriksen playing behind our CF, moving in and out of the box as Joe Allen did in the first half with Aspas in the Gerrard testimonial. 


He's of great quality, but honestly I don't think hes a necessary buy. However, he could become Ozil type player, giving chances to everyone around him and playing controlled over the ball.

They struggled throughout the 00s and currently they have a pretty strong team, though they haven't been able to make it to the NBA finals yet. It's gonna be rough for them now though since the Miami Heat are pretty much dominating both the Eastern conference and the league in general.

The Mets last won a championship in 1986. But since then have struggled mostly with a few prosperous years within. Currently the team is quite poor. Also should mention that they generally act as a little brother to the NY Yankees which is one of the most storied teams in all of American sports history and the team they share the city with (though in different boroughs)

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"As has been said, the Act of Union guarantees the Scottish legal system. It was a concern at the time of Union that Scotland's legal system would be replaced by English law. It's also worth noting that Northern Ireland has a different legal system as well.

As for having a homogenous legal system across the UK; it's one of those things that sounds OK, but would be completely impossible to implement. 

Given that Scotland is in the minority, any potential homogenisation would probably involve the imposition of English law on Scotland. This would obviously be politically undesirable, especially with the upcoming referendum. In any case, we have a devolved parliament, which passes laws only applicable to Scotland. That doesn't lend itself particularly well to a single legal system.

On an entirely practical plane, it would be a bloody nightmare (technical term) to implement. The entire Scottish legal profession would need to retrain. You need to pass at least a one-year conversion course currently. It would also mean that the police would need to retrain, as would countless other professions. It's also cause chaos in pension fund management. Many large companies uses the peculiarities of Scottish limited partnerships to structure their pensions finds advantageously. 

It would also lead to the destruction of a great many traditions, societies and jobs. The Law Society in Scotland would go, as would the Faculty of Advocates and the Society of Writers to Her Magesty's Signet.

I'm sure a female Doctor *could* work at some point but the character is not at the point. What will put it there I don't know. 

For anyone who has spoken to me about the casting of the 12th (usually non-fans) or subsequent Doctors and why/if/how the person should be female, the best analogy I can use to describe why The Doctor should be male would be to ask what the world's reaction would be to a female James Bond or a male Sarah Connor for example.

Just because a person would prefer a male/female for a recurring character due to that character being so strongly connected with that gender does not make them sexist.

The Doctor as a character is male and, although there is the canon ability for the character to switch gender, The Doctor should stay male until there is a point in the show where bringing in a female Doctor would add something unique to the show (not just the fact it would be the first female Doctor), it is not done because ""it's about time"" or other such phrases which have been thrown about and most importantly is relevant to the story arc and/or character development within the show.",0,1375626747,null,0,1375627060,0,cbgpi8j,t3_1joge5,t1_cbgpi8j,t1_cbgp6n7,null,1429949838,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

In the rare case there is a well containment breach instead of toxic chemicals entering the ground we have water and non-toxic chemicals entering the ground. 

Process safety is all about defence in depth, even if one thing fails there are numerous backup systems in place to ensure containment is held and in a worst case scenario where something does go wrong and containment is breached any damage should be minimised because the process should aim to be inherently safe.

Any breach in containment is likely to occur due to a well casing failure rather than through fracture propagation (which is what you're referring to in your post), that is why there is a huge amount of focus on the design and testing of the wells.

True, it only takes one bad driver to get someone killed. But declaring war on drivers is not going to help *anybody*. At all. We don't want attrition. What we want is for inconsiderate driving to be (rightly) considered just as anti-social as drink driving.

The sort of people who overtake into oncoming traffic leaving you 6"" of clearance, or cut across you at junctions, are simply *not* going to change their behaviour because cyclists get pissed off. All they'll do if confronted is adopt some sort of belligerent anti-cycling stance from a tabloid columnist, and become more entrenched in their hatred of cyclists. And probably cut up the next one deliberately, rather than just carelessly. 

You do make a good point: my driving also improved (I think) because of cycling.  I recommend doing a trailer course as well: I'm a better driver because of it, but now shit-scared of trailers, or more specifically the many untrained people driving with them, when I'm riding my bike...

This is supported by the fact that either 9 or 10 (I forget who, I've just marathoned the first 4 seasons) used up 10 years of his life using regeneration energy to fix something.

I would assume that the amount of regeneration energy a Time Lord possesses is different for all of them, and the amount of energy it takes to regenerate differs between regenerations (see: 10 regenerating just enough to fix himself).

I understand their psychology. yet people seem to think I am enabling them. I am not. i am explaining their psychology. If you don't believe me listen to the trolls themselves. 6 Minutes in they explain why they do it. They do it for a reaction. The troll explicitly states that that they target women because they react. he also specifically states  that if they just blocked them they would move on and they also specifically state that there is not political agenda.  

Trust me I spend enough time on /b/ to know the psychology of these people the only reason they are targeting ""women with views and influence"" is because the larger the number of followers the larger the the fallout. 

They live little powerless lives and to make up for this they seek to control others. This gives them a sense of control they often lack in their own lives.  If they get a few people butthurt then it's okay, if they can get a whole internet forum butthurt then it's pretty cool. If they can get twitter to freak out and get on the news they it's considered an ""epic"" troll of ""legendary"" legendary proportions.  Attaching a political agenda to it is failing to see the reality of the situation.  The problem a lot of feminist have is that when they get abuse over the internet they see it as part of their cause and internalise the abuse to their cause seeing it as proof of patriarchy or proof that all men hate women. The truth is that a lot of men receive abuse on twitter but they don't attach the abuse to a political cause so the abuse just gets blocked and ignored. 

Remember before you start giving me grief about ""justifying"" or "" agreeing"" with this shit like the rest of reddit seems to do I want to state for the record "" I am NOT saying it's okay, I am not justifying I am just explaining the psychology"". 

I have explained it. I have provided good evidence not just from my own experience on the internet but also with direct evidence from the trolls themselves.  If after seeing that evidence you decide that this is indeed evidence of patriarchy or all men hating women then that is your choice. But there is good evidence to point out that it's just idiots seeking to get a reaction.

During Davison's tenure they lost ratings and, I think, were looking for an actor who could take them back to the successful heydays with Tom Baker (Colin and Sylvester I think were very much callbacks to Tom Baker).  Making the mistake that the Doctor is more important than the stories (which were the real problem back then, and are starting to become the problem again now).

I want them to go in a completely different direction and outrage the loyal fans.  I want to hear ""What the hell are they thinking?  How is this going to work?"" and then I want to see them have a plan on how it would work and just wow us.  It's big risks that have the largest successes.

That's why I was hoping for Naomie Harris, or Dame Judy Dench, or Delroy Lindo, or Nina Wadia or Deep Roy!  Deep Roy or Warwick Davis would be awesome as the Doctor.

This keeps everything dry and using separate bags helps to keep things tidy and quick to find while on the road.

Another ghetto fix, if you don't fancy the plastic bag route, is to line the seams with plumbing/electrical tape. This will keep the water out and won't mark your cases, but if you are going into your cases a lot during the day could be expensive to maintain. You can reuse the tape if it stays dry, but once wet it's hard to reapply reliably.

Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, a common sight in Britain in 1963, when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.

true,FootballMythbusters,null,null,"Here's what I said in another thread, just last week:
I think that with Arab money coming in (the silly-money PSG and Monaco) kind, we'd lose a lot more than we'd gain:

* Long-term management: do we want a new manager every year, or the insanity that has been Chelsea over the past few years? I like Rodgers, I want to give him the chance to develop a long-term project. We can achieve just as much with sustainability and improving the team incrementally each season.

* Promising youth: All those youth players that we love and want to see? They'll never get a chance again. We'll never see another Gerrard, or Carragher, because we'll always be buying established players before we give them a chance. There will never be another Scouse player (or even an academy player) playing for the club as long as a multi-multi-billionaire owns it.

* Anfield, and the redevelopment. Given the speed at which these projects usually tend to take place, they'll probably immediately look to build a new stadium, and we'll lose Anfield.

* The Aggers, Lucas', Kuyt's, Xabi Alonso's of the team - over the past few years, we have had a lot of great players (who were bought for relatively cheap prices) come to the club to play for the club. I will always remember Kuyt, Alonso, Luis Garcia, and the way they still hold the club dear. Say goodbye to this, and hello to players that chose us because we paid more than City or PSG, and say goodbye to them once they get offered more by those clubs.

* The scouting team: We hired our scouting team from Man City because they were pissed off they were going un-used. They were giving Mancini cheaper alternatives and he wasn't listening - instead he was just buying the big name. But would you rather have a player that comes because we're one of 7 teams offering silly money, or because we're the only team offering him a contract - as with Coutinho and Sturridge - and all they needed was a place where they could play. I'd rather have Coutinho that Lucas Moura, I'd rather have Sturridge than Negredo. 

Yes, I want us to compete. But I want us to do it like Man Utd. Long-term manager, incremental improvements every year. Yes, they spent money, but not like Man City or Chelsea, and the money they spent they earned from establishing themselves as one of the biggest clubs in the world.

The thing is, we don't actually *need* Arab money. We are already an established brand. Just look at the insane scenes in Jakarta or Melbourne and everyone can see we're one of the biggest clubs in the world, despite being a mid-table team for the past few seasons. All we need is to get that 4th spot, and I truly believe it will come under Rodgers. The moment it does, we're back competing for top talent anyway, but with a great academy, great scouts, and enough money from FSG and CL that we can compete for a top player every now and then anyway, to supplement the good work that goes on in the youth and scouting. It's just a far, far better way to do things, but the best thing about it is it's **sustainable**. If every year we have to fork out another 200k a week to buy a big player, or sack the manager because he only won the CL, then I just don't know how much joy I'd actually feel if it takes 6 managers on the scrapheap and 500m in 2 years just to win the league.",0,1375639036,null,0,false,0,cbgsy2w,t3_1joozy,t1_cbgsy2w,t3_1joozy,null,1429948233,35,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,35

true,salathiel,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Rule #1. The Doctor lies.

He mentioned the corsair was once female. He could be lying. For a Timelord to change gender, as /u/azchrisb said, the last 50 years would basically be useless.

Tell me, what are the odds of a Timelord changing gender? 50/50? And somehow the Doctor managed to get male 11 times in a row? And the Master got it at least 3 times in a row. 

If a Timelord can change gender, how does marriage work, if at all? They may not have a system of marriage, but just something interesting, if they do. Not a major point.

What if one is pregnant? Do they lose the baby? Do they become a pregnant man? Or are they somehow forced into staying a woman?

How would Timelords even have a concept of relationships if their partner can change gender with no notice? ""Oh ya, I've been in love with Marge for 45- oh shit, it's Bob now? Ya, no thanks.""

Show me once where it is OFFICIALLY canon (not just ""The Doctor said so"") that they can change gender. It is absolutely pointless to speculate, and Moffat needs to stop trying to change shit that's worked for 40ish years or better. If there is ever a female Doctor, I will stop watching and consider the show over, though I know many people will still watch. Moffat has been real heavy on feminism for whatever reason, and that's fine, but the Doctor is male.

If I remember any other points along this line, I'll let you know.

true,Imnon,null,null,"&gt;He mentioned the corsair was once female. He could be lying.

The 4th Doctor and the 11th Doctor both mentioned the Corsair being both female and male, it makes sense to trust him here. If you're going to use ""the doctor lies"" to discount anything you don't agree with, than nothing he says is ever canon at all.

&gt;For a Timelord to change gender, as /u/azchrisb said, the last 50 years would basically be useless.

I don't even begin to see how. 

&gt;Tell me, what are the odds of a Timelord changing gender? 50/50? And somehow the Doctor managed to get male 11 times in a row? And the Master got it at least 3 times in a row. 

We know that Timelords can have a small amount of control over their regenerations, so perhaps he's always just willed it towards male. Or perhaps once a timelord is male or female, they naturally default to that unless they will it into changing. Perhaps it's just incredibly coincidental, I don't know. Timelord regenerations haven't really been fleshed out enough to discuss it in detail.

&gt;If a Timelord can change gender, how does marriage work, if at all? They may not have a system of marriage, but just something interesting, if they do. Not a major point.

&gt;How would Timelords even have a concept of relationships if their partner can change gender with no notice? ""Oh ya, I've been in love with Marge for 45- oh shit, it's Bob now? Ya, no thanks.""

You're making the assumption that Gallifreyan culture operates under the same binary system human culture always has, which I think is completely unfair and probably entirely wrong. It's incredibly likely that they simply don't care, most people who were in love with someone for 45 years (and probably much longer if we're talking about timelords here) probably wouldn't immediately stop loving them just because their sex changed, especially not in a culture that wasn't so unreasonably anti-gay as many human cultures. 

&gt;What if one is pregnant? Do they lose the baby? Do they become a pregnant man? Or are they somehow forced into staying a woman?

I'd go with being forced to stay a woman, but as morbid as it is I'd imagine a regeneration during pregnancy would probably cause a miscarriage anyway. 

&gt;Show me once where it is OFFICIALLY canon (not just ""The Doctor said so"") that they can change gender.

It doesn't even need to be officially canon, because it's not officially canon that they *can't* change sex yet. If you don't take the doctor's comments about the Corsair as canon, then it hasn't been set in writing either way, and can still be written whichever way the head writer prefers. 

&gt;Moffat has been real heavy on feminism for whatever reason,

On a mostly unrelated note, Moffat has completely *not* been really heavy on feminism. He's probably the worst example of a feminist anyone could pick besides a straight up misogynist. He likes writing sexy, badass female characters exclusively and squeezes in juvenile sexist jokes where he can.

PSG are doing the same as City and they wanted to keep Ancelotti, he just decided to leave them. 

They spend money, but they also expect results. They aren't like Abramovich that fires a manager every year. These are not stupid men, they buy European clubs as a long term investment.

And stop using Dortmund as an example for fucks sake.. They have a world class manager who spent less on his whole squad than your beloved FSG bought Andy Fucking Carroll for...

So even though he might possibly be an earlier incarnation, this shouldn't effect the number of actual ""Doctors"".

As for the woman or person of colour role, there's a couple reasons with that. First, since we seem to be following the Doctor and he likes to knock around the 18th Century, he'd have a hard time posing as the King's emissary since everyone would just assume he was a slave with stolen papers. Women couldn't be professors or doctors until relatively recently, so while I'm sure we could visit far out places like Africa and whatnot, it would be a big, big change in the show. 

Additionally, I don't see a plot relevance to it. The Doctor changed to a different actor because they had to replace the actor and didn't want to end the show. I'd rather not change the actor, but they forced themselves into that because they couldn't put the show to bed after one actor left it, which I understand from a business point of view.",0,1375643469,null,0,false,0,cbgucv4,t3_1jowx2,t1_cbgucv4,t1_cbgu1k1,null,1429947502,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Iv never seen 4 across. I would say its so rare as not to be an issue (not saying it does not happen though) 

As for 3, very occasionally. And 2 is legal.

The issue with 2 abreast is that the Highway Code allows for it (as long as not a busy road/round a corner). But the HC also asks that car drivers overtake giving a cyclist as much room as a car. This section then has a photo of a car overtaking a cyclist using the full opposite lane. Point is, if drivers overtook cyclists correctly the 2 abreast issue would be a non issue.

The other issue for some cyclists is the danger imposed upon them by some drivers. I'm sure you're a great driver (just like everyone) but if a cyclist has had issues on particular roads with some drivers in the past they may (legally) choose to take the lane to stop dangerous overtaking. This sometime results in riding two abreast, or even going single file but cycling in the middle or the lane (again totally legal).

I guess what I'm saying is on occasion the need to cycle in such a way is an unfortunate byproduct of our road system/and some attatudes (by cyclists and drivers) and not always because a cyclist wishes to piss anyone off. I'm genuinely yet to meet any keen cyclist who goes out of their way to gamble with angry drivers. And personally, if its safe ill always move over.

Madame Vastra and Jenny are close, but they're, at the most, great cameo characters. I can understand if women wanted a female character who could stand side-by-side with, or even tower over, The Doctor. But I can't wrap my mind around changing his gender making all the problems go away. I'd feel that'd be pandering. It'd be like if at some point during ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", there was a male slayer. I'd still be complaining if that ever happened, and you'd think a guy would love that. And I'm not against changing genders. I'm a big fan of ""Invisible Monsters"" and ""Ranma 1/2"", two stories with gender-malleable characters. I also sympathize with transgendered and transsexual people because I can't imagine how hard it must be to be born in a body that doesn't fit your mind, and having to put up with that confusion for years.

But regarding who follows/ does not follow rules. Everyday I see drivers breaking the rules - almost every second car I see when going down the 20mph road is doing 25-30mph, I typically see 1-3 uses of a phone. Occasional car in a cycle box.

Car drivers I feel don't see the actual real behavior of other drivers like cyclists do, often when I drive in to work I tend to only interact with 5-10 cars on my commute...when I'm cycling I interact with 20-40 cars.

Also, I'd estimate that around 10% of drivers don't overtake cyclists correctly. This is of no issue to drivers so drivers never bring it up, but seriously scares the crap out of me, and it's considerably more dangerous than anything a cyclist does.

He is much more gung-ho on the adventure aspect and has limitless hope (No doubt after the atrocities of the time war and finally feeling some sort of relief that it might all be over). I very much enjoy this doctor because, while the ""angst"" of the time war made for a ripe and complicated character, having a doctor who just wants to see the wonders of the universe again is charming.

Now, apart from The Doctor, the episodes are actually really amazing. If you loved the over-arching qualities of the other episodes (Bad Wolf, Vote for Saxxon, Rose popping up and Donna's coincidences) then the next seasons are going to be perfect for you. While there are still the usual adventures, the seasons follow an Arc of the doctor confronting an ancient race over hundreds of years.


As for the companions, I think it's a nice change of pace for two reasons. 1 They stick around for more than one season which I personally like and 2 There's not much romantic involvement with the doctor, ala Donna. In my opinion I like it when the companions don't have a romantic interest in the doctor.

true,cptzaprowsdower,uk,Darlington,"Agree 100%. The two characters are comparable to the extent that they are both the figureheads of long running British franchises, but that's about where it ends. Each embodies considerably different values and meanings.

Dr Who is a wacky alien with two hearts. The only consistency required of that character is for him to be a bit off the wall and sport a zany fashion sense. He can be English, Scottish, white, black, Asian, whatever so long as the core tenets of the character remain constant.

Bond on the other hand is a privileged, hedonistic, chauvinistic Englishman with a fondness for the Empire. These values - historically, if nothing else - intersect quite strongly with the fact that he's a white male, making it a fairly essential element of his characterisation.

Of course I wouldn't want to see the franchise stand still, but I think it could be modernised in a more respectful way that remains true to the character (I think Goldeneye did this well and Brosnan makes for an excellent post-Cold War Bond). 'Emotional frailty' is one way of making him more representative of the modern man I suppose, but it was also the worst thing about (the otherwise excellent) *Casino Royale*, so naturally they decided to make it the predominant element of his character in *Skyfall*. 

As a big fan of the franchise it does make me a little nervous over where it's going in the future and to what extent the classic notion of *Bond* will be compromised. I mean, what next? His stoic stiff upper lip crumbled way as he had a good cry at the end of Skyfall (George Lazenby was forbidden to do that at the end of OHMSS btw since the producers felt it would compromise his masculinity, even though *his wife had just been shot to death by Blofeld*). What further debasements does he have in store? How else will his character be meddled with? God, they might make him Welsh or something. * *shudder* *

If you give cars half an opportunity, they'll try to squeeze through too-small a gap, e.g. when there's an oncoming vehicle, and this could be what's causing your knocked elbows.  

Getting your elbows knocked does sound extremely nerve-wracking - it's never happened to me.  But be bold and take up that lane if you don't want a car to pass you.

2. Arsenal isn't a step up, Arsenal are the souths biggest club - but they aren't Liverpool or United in terms of club size. Sure you make the CL year in year out, but you win fuck all and have arguably the most fickle fans in football - BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO etc etc

I'm not slagging your team off to be a cunt, just saying, moving to Arsenal because you want to win things and play in the CL is madness. Arsenal are always out by the quarter finals if not earlier.

Q3 Arsenal fans will say Wilshere, Liverpool fans will say Coutinho.

I will say this, if Joe Allen or Jordan Henderson played for Arsenal, the media would be saying how they are the next british superstar like they do with JW10. He is a good player, but needs to stay fit. Coutinho did more in 6 months than Wilshere has done in the past two seasons.

Q4. If Suarez stays i'm very confident we can finish above you. If you sign Suarez - which you won't, if he leaves it will be abroad you would finish above us. If we sell Suarez foreign and reinvest with players like Costa and Papadopolous we will finish above you.

I tried to not be a prick in my answers, but it's hard given the total lack of respect Arsenal have shown my club over the past few weeks.

You killed any possible deal the moment you did the ""and a pound"" bid, it was insulting and Arsenal should have more dignity than that.

You will struggle to find an en-suite for £75 with bills (and insurance preferably). Most of the shared accommodation in Leeds is terraced housing that has been converted to students and so theres a few bathrooms for 5+ people in most cases. The en-suite rooms are usually in new-builds either from the University or from private companies (UNITE, IQ, Opal etc. ) who have buildings all around the city - but I think they'll all be above £75. (Heres one for £85 http://www.iq-student-accommodation.com/leeds/rooms/en-suite-bedroom-type-1 , but it's a bit out, and in a little bit of an iffy area)

As a first year though I'd definitely try to live with others, and not to be too specific with an en-suite. They're great to have, but I'd rather have a nicer house/room than an adjacent toilet.

DEFINITELY GO LOOK AT THE PROPERTY, I cannot say this enough. Actually walk from the place to the University. Pictures on the websites can be _very_ misleading.

EDIT: I removed my original comment after having a very stressful day and not wanting to worry about arguing with strangers online when I got home, but I would like to make a final statement to the people who commented:

I think the people saying that the time isn't quite right for a female Doctor are probably correct. I guess I was more disappointed that there wasn't a change at all. I wasn't holding out too much hope for a female Doctor, but I thought a different ethnicity was a good chance. To me, it just feels wrong because the message of the show is so inclusive. I've noticed a lot of strides being made in these areas in all other sorts of nerd culture, including better representation of women in comics, and even a middle-eastern Green Lantern being introduced, so it just seems odd that Dr. Who isn't (yet) trying to address this. I thought the show did very well casting Martha and Donna, being a woman of color and an older woman, but it seems they've completely drifted back to model-attractive white girls. I hold nothing against the actors, but I'm tired of no one else being represented. At the children's library where I work, I go out of my way to display books about all sorts of children, in the hopes that they can see themselves represented. Should they not also be able to see themselves represented by the smartest, most heroic character in pop culture? I understand that they have picked Mr. Capaldi for very good reasons. I'm sure he's a great actor, and probably an excellent fit for the character. But at some point, you have to think outside the story, and look into the real world and see what is needed.  Doctor Who gives hope and happiness and a sort of moral compass to many, many people.  At this point, although it is just a tv program, I do feel like it has a sort of responsibility to it's audience (many of whom are children, whether it is intended for children or not), to set an example and light the way.

It can't be safer for them and it holds up traffic for no reason.

Hi, I commute through Oxford on my bicycle every day.

Have you *seen* some of the so-called ""cycling facilities"" in Oxford? I'm pretty sure the council is taking the piss with the 50 cm-wide shared-use footways that give way every for every single driveway and direct me to cycle directly into trees. I'll cycle on the road because it's literally safer (albeit marginally), thank you very much.

Also, it's usually the cars holding *me* up. I find it particularly facepalm-inducing when someone overtakes me at 30 mph in a 20 mph limit zone and then pull in front of me and slam on the brakes so they can join a stationary queue of traffic.

true,kopking08,null,null,"1. To compare squads is a difficult proposition in my book, for both our clubs for many of the same reasons. 

GK: Is our goalie better than yours? Hard to say. Arsenal were said to be in for Cesar but that never panned out and there hasn't been any talk I've heard about anyone else. You have more depth here but thats only relevant if Mignolet goes down with an injury. Which is rarer for goalies.

RB: We have Johnson, who I would argue is better going forward than Sagna but defensively Sagna might still have the edge. Depth wise we have it pipped because Kelly could be first team, and Wisdom proved his worth last year.

LB: Right now its Enrique/Johnson v Monreal/Gibbs. I'd only give us the edge based on PL experience, but there's barely an edge.

CB: Right now I think this is a complete wash. You guys have been so up and down defensively its hard to make a conclusive statement about your CBs. Same goes for us really. 

DM: You guys don't really play a pure DM right now and it has hindered your team at times. Lucas adds stability for us in that respect but I wouldn't say its a huge edge.

CM: 


Fuck, I'm tired of this. Basically, I don't think you can say conclusively Arsenal are better than Liverpool. That is my only thought on the matter. You guys barely edged 4th last year. That was an accomplishment but a minor one.  

I absolutely do believe Liverpool, Tottenham, and Arsenal all have as much of a shot at 4th as the others. The closer you get to the top, the harder it is to improve. Which means it'll be easier for us to gain points this season than it will for Arsenal. I have no doubt the gap, if we finish behind you, will be much smaller.


I think my thoughts are very similar to many Pool fans thoughts. Arsenal may be better. We may agree your consistent CL qualification is an achievement. But where we diverge is that it means you're on the up or heading down.

Wenger has kept you guys level. He's staved off real charges by Tottenham. Thats an accomplishment.

But I've been pissed at my Arsenal friend because he genuinely is only looking ahead in the table. He's thinking, ""Oh, with Suarez maybe we can jump higher EVEN WIN"". That is a mind boggling sentiment. Mostly because what it fails to consider is how close you are to not being 4th.

My thought is Arsenal are more likely to finish 5th than they are 3rd. And that is why I think it'd be ridiculous for Suarez to go there. He's a top 5 player in the world. Those types of players don't make steps up from Liverpool to Arsenal. They leave our clubs the same way. 

We're both feeder clubs to the best in the world. Just like teams below us feed to us. But you guys are not the best in the world. You're within reach. And thats why it boggles the mind any Arsenal player would think we'd sell to them. If you're within reach, we aren't going to give you our best player and have that put us out of reach.

But Liverpool's squad is pretty great as well. Young, hungry and technically sound players who, going on the end of last season and pre season are all looking like a really strong group. I would say both squads are good, but there is only one world class player in either, and that's Luis Suarez. So I guess it comes down a lot to him. 

2) To be honest, Arsenal are a step up from Liverpool, ones in the champions league and one isn't, it's hard to argue against that. But I don't the step up is as big as many Arsenal fans are making out. It's a marginal increase but it's certainly not of the level that it was when RVP left Arsenal for Manchester United. Arsenal were and still are nowhere near challenging Man U, whilst Liverpool have the capability to challenge for fourth and that will be the intention for next season. 

3) Not fair to say either until they both get a full season under their belts at the same time. But going on pre season (I know it's not the best judging tool) surely it's Coutinho.

4) million dollar question. All depends on Luis Suarez - if he's at Arsenal probable that we won't.

The fact that you describe a female actor playing the Doctor as a novelty pair of breasts is very telling.  You seem to think that is the only reason they would pick a woman.  Can we please leave sex appeal out of this?  Hopefully, while I acknowledge that many people find the Doctor sexy, nobody thinks that that has anything to do with which actor is right for the role.  

The truth is, unless creators make putting POC and female characters out there a priority, it's never going to happen.  Picking a white male is the default, it's the easiest choice.  Nothing ever changes unless people work to make the change.  Whether it was intentional or not, the fact that they picked a white male again after so many people voiced their need for something different, only serves to reinforce the idea that my sex isn't good enough and if I were anything but white, that wouldn't be good enough either.

But I think you have a lot of ineffective deadwood that you could easily replace to become better but never do. Our manager's only had 1 year to reshape and train the squad, your manager's signed or brought through every player at your club.

2. Yes it's a step up currently, but it's not a particularly big step. For one, Arsenal could easily find themselves outside of the CL in a year, and perhaps even at the expense of Liverpool, if we have a particularly good season. I think Spurs will get it, personally. I think what Suarez should do is wait for Madrid or a really big team come for him, joining Arsenal now means he'll be there 2 years and want to move on to a bigger club. By then he's 28 and no one will pay big money, he'll have a long contract at Arsenal and it'll be difficult to get a move.

a)  Some outside group provides a chunk of money for the naming rights at the revamped Anfield (XYZ Stadium at Anfield, as an example). I could see this happening as it would help defray the costs of the expansion, but I could also see FSG being reluctant to do so as historically they don't seem to keen on messing with the club's history nor did they rename Fenway when they well could have.  So, I'd rate this one as a possibility, but I think unlikely.

b)  The owners could accept outside investment into the team as a minority stakeholder.  If they do this, it provides no value to LFC directly so it's largely irrelevant to the club.  Could happen, but the money gained would go to the owners not the club so largely irrelevant to me as a supporter.

c)  The owners could sell the club outright.  I think if they got an acceptable deal (say in the realm of £550M+) from what they consider a credible buyer then I do think they would sell as I think it's pretty apparent they underestimated LFC's financial position upon acquisition.  That said, I really don't think anyone would come in with that kind of cash for LFC otherwise they likely would have done so the last time the club was up for sale.  So, I suspect this is rather unlikely.

true,EJR94,lfcflame,,"Alright, I got some time to kill for the first one. Lets see how the squads match up

Mignolet v Schez

Mignolet near enough kept Sunderland up single handedly. Their defence was appalling and he looks to be one of the brightest prospects around Europe at the moment. Szczęsny has had his moments but if we're honest he isn't quite on Mignolets level. I'd say Mignolet wins this round

Sagna v Johnson

Johnson, for all his defensive flaws, is still one of the best right backs around. When attacking, there are only a handful of wingers that can match his ability let alone full backs. He has been a creative outlet in an unlikely position. He plays almost as a second winger, playing in and around the actual winger. Sagna isn't exactly afwul going forwards but I don't think he matches Johnson. On the other hand, Sagna is superior to Johnson at defending. Unfortunately Johnson is too far upfield too often. When he's back he can defend as well as the best but he doesn't anticipate danger well enough. I'd still prefer Johnson over Sagna, but I'm unsure of whether its due to my personal bias or if he's actually better. I'll say Johnson wins, for now.

Toure v Mertesacker

I don't know if BR plans on playing Toure CB this season or if he's planning on bringing in someone new (like papa) but this position is one of our weakest imo. I don't rate Mertesacker too highly but he's shown more for himself than Toure has over the last few years. I'll give it to Mertesacker on that basis but I still believe Toure has a lot to offer. If we bring in Papa, then I'd say he's better than Mertesacker

Agger v Koscielny

Agger is a terrific ball playing centre back, one of the reasons Barca have been so interested in him. Koscielny has had a decent season which has garnered him some more attention but personally I think he's still below Agger by a fair bit. I think I'll give this to Agger.

Enrique v Nacho

Two spanish full backs fighting to be the spanish back up. Enrique is quick, strong and can pull of some amazing link up play with Suarez. He also isn't very intelligent, he picks out some poor passes and tries to play his way out of danger instead of taking the safe option nearly every time. Nacho, I don't know much about honestly. He's never really caught my eye so I don't know what to say about this. Maybe someone else can decide? 

Arteta v Lucas

The two defensive mids (if you can really call Arteta that) aren't very similar. Arteta is a fantastic passer of the ball and can dictate play. Lucas breaks up play and reads the game to force the opposition into passing it straight to him. If this was the pre-injury Lucas, I'd have no problems picking him. However his injury has set him back somewhat. He's still, in my eyes, the best pure defensive mid in the league but that's because there aren't too many qualtiy DMs, Sandro is probably the closest. Arteta is a great player but I think its a tie since they both have great quality but are uncompareable.

Gerrard v Wilshere

Sure Wilshere has bags of potential but even so he's still a long way off Gerrards level. He could reach it someday, but that depends if he could stay fit long enough to. Easy choice in my mind, Gerrard.

Coutinho v Cazorla

As much as this hurts me, Cazorla is the better player. Currently. Coutinho has been magical for half a season, and he's been better than Cazorla for that half a season and shows every inclination of being better than Cazorla next season. But, Cazorla has proven himself more and really is the focal point of the Arsenal team. He pulls the strings and makes great pass after great pass. The difference isn't great, but Cazorla currently wins.

Sterling v Walcott

Damn it, this is annoying because Sterling is a much more talented footballer but Walcott has been around long enough and had a bigger impact for Arsenal. Sterling will be better, but until then Walcott wins 
:(

Suarez v Podolski

Suarez wins. Comfortably

Sturridge v Giroud

Sturridge has just shown that he's a great striker with us and I just don't see that in Giroud. He had a great season at Montpilliar but he's not cut it in the PL so far, so Sturridge wins.

As for the benches

Jones=Fabianski

Kelly (if he can stay fit)= Gibbs

Skrtel&lt;Vermaelen (Both had poor seasons, but I know who I'd rather have)

Allen &gt; Diaby

Henderson &gt; Ramsey

Borini/Ibe &lt; Chamberlain

Aspas &gt; Bendtner/Chamakh

Yeah I think the Baines thing was a while back, and it ended rather fast. I've not given it much attention since. Fellaini would be frightening, I sincerely hope that doesn't come about!

Yeah my parents are from Manchester and Dad's a City fan - they moved to Shropshire a year or so before I was born - so I support City because of that and go to games with Dad, but I feel it's only right to pay attention to Shrewsbury too, as they're technically my hometown club. Might sound a bit strange, but I get to go to more football so I'm not bothered. I suppose if I was being a purist about it I should choose one over the other.

I think Shrews will be ok. We were relegation favourites last season and finished 16th, and we're relegation favourites again this season. There's a lot of youth in the squad, but judging from yesterday's game there is promise, as long as Turner can get another striker in before the window closes - at the moment we're starting a lad who failed to score in 22 aps last season, has had plenty of chances to prove himself, and remains unconvincing. 

The new manager at City will certainly make for an interesting season. Hopefully he can get Dzeko scoring again, as I really want the guy to do well, but sometimes he makes me weep with frustration.

The new Doctor is supposed to be the same person as the old Doctor, just in a different body with the odd different personality quirk (mainly to do with dress sense). There is little scope for the Doctor to behave in a completely different way.

A lot of drama explores issues of ethnic or female characters arriving in roles traditionally dominated by white males. There is a lot of scope for interesting drama, and positive representation of minorities.

But here we would just have a black or female actor playing the same character that has previously been played by 11 white men. Contrived and not interesting. Even more tedious when the next Doctor is a female Asian because it's their turn.

For them to have got there they need an education system to teach, train and inform them, and instil ideas to reject dogma and understand new technologies that will advance through their career. They need to be surrounded by other people who value their work and accept it, even if it can seem esoteric confusing and sometimes even pointless to the lay person.

true,rydleo,null,null,"My thoughts:

1)  No, I wouldn't go so far as to say our team is better than Arsenal's, although I do think it's a pretty close thing and we're not miles apart either.  I do think you're in a similar position to us in the past (prior to this season) where you've got an awful lot of people hanging around who aren't very good sucking up wages and probably need to go somewhere else- Gervinho, Chamakh, Bendtner, and I don't really rate Mertesacker at all.  A bit of clean up and I think you'd be better off, personally, similar to what BR has had to do offloading people like Carroll, Adam, etc.

2)  A step up?  Debatable, but if so, I think it's a pretty small one.  You're about us unlikely to win the league as we are, but could go on a cup run for sure (but so could we).  You have CL and that's helped you out, so financially you're better off than us (~£50M more in turnover and I think maybe £20M more in wage bill as I recall).  Given your finances are in better shape than ours, you perhaps have more immediate potential of improving, but again I think much depends on you being able to a) attract good targets and b) get rid of some of squad players who aren't very good. 

3)  It's difficult to say right now as Coutinho has only had half a season in the PL and Wilshere seems to be not playing much these days.  If you had asked me this 2 years ago, I would have said Wilshere by a mile.  Unfortunately his injuries have really hurt his progress and, based what I've seen recently, I'd would say Countinho is better by a fair bit.  We'll perhaps both have a better understanding of where the truth lies after the season is over but in my opinion I think Wilshere may struggle to reach the heights he once seemed capable of reaching- similar to Ramsey a bit.  Injuries of that length for young players tends to become an issue (I see the same thing for Martin Kelly on our side, to be honest- I'm not sure he'll be able to reach the potential he once seemed to have either).

4)  I'd say it's unlikely but possible.  Call it 25% chance we finish ahead of you.  I don't think it's nailed on but it's also not impossible.  Either way I think we'll both be in the 4th-6th region.",0,1375653123,null,0,false,0,cbgxdag,t3_1jp60a,t1_cbgxdag,t3_1jp60a,null,1429946097,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

2. Arsenal, technically is a step up for Suarez. You guys do have Champions league which we do not. Now the thing is, Arsenal isn't really that big of a step up for him. This season he'll turn 27, the only offers that he should be looking at are the ones that definitely offer silverware. He's good enough for the best teams in the world to want him, and those teams are where he would win. 
3. I think it's too early to say which is better. Wilshere hasn't had a full season in ages and Coutinho has only had half a season in the Premier league. Even if both of them stay fit and have a full season, they're both still young. Either Wilshere or Coutinho could hit there peak out of nowhere and one could out-class the other.

Eccelston was angry and bossy and tough on the outside, he was mad about everything that had happened to him, and so it took Rose's love to break that down.
With Tennant it was all swagger and concealed pain. Tennant was full of vengeance, and killed easily and often. He shifted from anger to a desire for revenge against all that transgressed what he thought was right in the world. 
Smith learned fairly early that he needed to leave that anger behind (In his second episode with the whale), but Smith also had to go through all the regret and pain as he realized what he had become.

Selling a midfielder who gets you 20+ goals in a season is not going to get you anywhere if you can only replace him with a player who can get you 5-10 goals a season (pretty much an average for most 'goal scoring' midfielders) 

So selling Bale is going to diminish the squad no matter who you use the money to bring in. Such is the system that AVB wants to utilise (the now popular 4-3-3) somebody like Bale is what will make that tick over. He gets back, he gets forward, he scores goals and he'll set them up too. 

If you put Gylfi Sigurdsson (I know thats spelt wrong sorry) in that role you might get some tracking back, you won't get the direct counter attack though which is what made Bale a danger last year. You won't get that from Lennon either.

Selling Bale now also won't necessarily mean we'll have £100m to spend. We aren't a club that can spend that kind of money because our wage structure is limited. To spend that money we'd have to buy 6 different players probably at around £15m each, which would destroy our squad harmony.

true,rougecathy,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire (in exile in Surrey),"Conditional Fee Arrangements only work when you know that if you win you will get costs. In the rest of the civil courts (generally) loser pays costs, so you get insurance against paying the other sides costs (and your own costs, IIRC, it's been a while since I've looked at anything not related to Employment or Welfare). If you win then the other side pays your costs. At Employment Tribunal one party only pays the other side's costs in rare circumstaces, even rarer for an employer to pay the employees (because the employer has no choice but to defend the claim, so unless their defence is misconceived or they behave badly during proceedings they are unlikely to have to pay the winner's costs).

What you sometimes get in employment is contingency fee arrangements, where the lawyers work for free but will take a proportion of damages if you win. This only happens for fairly easy and valuable claims. I doubt lawyers firms will stump up the fee on hope alone.

If you bring a claim and win, it isn't guaranteed that you will get the fee back, although the tribunal has the power to order the respondent to pay the fee even if the respondent has not behaved badly.

Given the nature of how the league is 'won' with no proper playoff system, wage bill (and turnover to a  lesser extent, at least if you're not City) will statistical determine your place.

The CL spots going to the top 4 only exacerbates the problem as it gives them another £20-50M that the others don't have.  There are exceptions to this (see Everton and Swansea as good examples of teams punching above their weight) but for the most part it holds true.

So, if we want to challenge for the title, we need more revenue which will help spend more on wages and this is going to take time.  Or, someone with a lot of cash willing to do the 0-interest-loan-coverted-to-shares dance done by Sheikh Mansour and Abramovic.

Holocaust my arse ..

**There was no Anne Frank and if there had been, the Zionists who took out the rest of the non Z Jews would have gassed her too!**

&gt;The J's are fond of telling sob stories about how the wicked Nazi's led by wicked Adolph Hitler, did a job on the Jews, except [AH and the Nazi's were Jews](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3347309,00.html), who perped the Holocaust then went on to establish the illegal modern state of Israel.

&gt;It was a Zionist plot to kill those Jews true to the Divine Covenant, by which Allah assures Jews the Messiah will appear, whose purpose will be to restore the fortunes of the Jewish people, and to establish the nation state of Israel, and exhorts them to patience until that time comes.

**Understand this .. Jews infiltrate the political structure of every land that receives them, then write [Jew friendly legislation,](http://www.reddit.com/r/borntoday/comments/1hqe6u/born_today_july_5th_gyula_horn_politician_prime/caxyx3j) while perpetrating massive horrors on the host population.**

&gt;The non Jewish Nazis Ernst Rohm and the SA hierarchy, were slaughtered in the [Night of the Long Knives Massacre](http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1308/98/f5b3cbab5de4.png) of June 1934, after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as German Chancellor Jan 31, 1933. 

&gt;They did the same in Russia after instituting the False Flag 1917 Revolution, then slaughtering the Bolshevics whose ""Civil Disobedience"" a la the Civil Disobedience [Rabbi Adam Kokesh](http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/1hsq0o/bobby_powell_adam_kokesh_is_the_gift_that_keeps/caydsw0) is attempting to muster in the US, brought the sham Revolution to fruition!

&gt;It means they were in total power in Germany and the Soviet Union, no less than in France, England, Japan and the United States then as now, where after the similarly [False Flag Pearl Harbor attack of Dec 7, 1941,] (http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1gw8ac/pearl_harbor_cover_up_1000s_of_messages_were/caozrwx) where there were no enemy planes!

&gt;Hitler who was already at war with France, England and Russia, [declared un winnable war on the United States,](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Hitler+declared+war+on+the+United+States&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) Dec 11, 1941!

**The Pharisees caused their own people to be gassed in the millions during WW2, the gassings were selective, only some Jews were gassed!**

&gt;Witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s claim to be a Pharisee, and his contempt for the Jews who were gassed, Cheesies he called them .. Kaplan was a RAAF bomber pilot in WW2, who had flown in the 1945 air raid on [Dresden](http://julius-hensel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dresden-14-2-1945.jpeg), who says his Amsterdam family emerged unscathed.

&gt;After the war he flew Lockheed Electra’s for KLM in Holland and for Lufthansa .. he was the son of a well established Jewish family with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam and in Western Australia, later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking.

&gt;He was the image of the actor who played [Emmanuel Goldstein](http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9674/goldstein.jpg), in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, when I asked him how Radford obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he remained unforthcoming and seemed amused!

**After the war he returned to Amsterdam .. I said it must have been heart rending to go back to empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way!**

&gt;He said it was good, I said sure but what about all his friends and rellies, he said they were fine, I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 

&gt;Indeed The Diary of Anne Frank, a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazi’s was set in Amsterdam, as well Stanley Kramer’s great movie [Ship of Fools](http://mubi.com/films/ship-of-fools), based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s, had its culmination in that city where the ship finally docked.

&gt;After having been turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz gas and death .. Moshe nodded sagely, he told me he was a Pharisee..

&gt;That the Jews of Amsterdam as depicted in The Diary of Anne Frank, were certainly Jews however were not in the same category as him.. they were he told me called Cheesies, since their diet consisted largely of that product.

**That they were missing from the community because they had indeed been gassed, he gave me to understand as far as he was concerned, they were neither missed nor mourned.**

&gt;View the Holocaust as a collaboration of high ranking Pharisee Jews, who provided the finance, the uniforms and the marching songs, and the Nazi’s who would do the dirty work, to reduce the number of those Jews who might if they had the numbers, declare the day of the Pharisee at an end.

&gt;And to clean up any racial minority or dissident group, who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of becoming a threat at some time in the future, so the commos, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies and the lunatic fringe, were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles, and in Hitler’s words exterminated.

&gt;After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs had carried out the dirty deeds were themselves murdered, Ernst Rohm leader of the thug SA movement, murdered with numerous of his thug mates, in the in June 1934 [Night of the Long Knives.](http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1308/98/f5b3cbab5de4.png)

**The bully boys who did the hands on jobs of thuggery, the scabs of their day, witness the 1929 murder of numerous members of the Gas Fitters Union in Germany.**

&gt;Deeds that were done to empower the Nazis after they had emerged as a political force, with Hitler at their helm in the late 1920’s, murdering, bashing, extorting, and thugging their way along, until the Nazi’s gained absolute power in 1933.

&gt;Then witness the testimony of [Katherine Schweitzer](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/search?q=Katherine+Schweitzer) a Jewish lady from Budapest, whose family of fourteen was arrested in 1944, by a Jew member of Horsha the Hungarian thug police, and deported to Auschwitz.

&gt;Who told Australian 60 Minutes reporter Richard Carleton, the Jew who arrested her was living a few doors up on the same street in Sydney Australia, her murdered body was discovered in a wheely bin inside her high security Sydney apartment, December 28, 2006.

[According to Alex Jones,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAWf4d4hVtw) George Soros then in his teen years, ""cataloged"" the possessions of Jews deported from Budapest at that time .. we say he was ""hands on"" in her case!

true,Lebawski,null,null,"I agree with much of what has already been said but I want to add my two cents as well. 

1. Arsenal's squad is slightly better than Liverpools at the moment, but Liverpool has some better individual players like Gerrard, Suarez and Coutinho. Defensively we are very similar, we both have decent RB/LB and one Beast of a CB (Agger/Koscielny), and one unreliable CB (Skrtel/Vermaelen). Arsenal might have slightly better chemistry but I'm not sure. 
2. Arsenal is such a small step up for Suarez that I wouldn't even count it as a step up. He is a player who could play for Bayern or Real Madrid. Liverpool is a bigger club than Arsenal, but Arsenal has CL. The big point though is that Arsenal isn't really a club that wins trophys anymore - and Suarez wants to leave to win trophys. 
3. Coutinho is better than Wilshere in attack, Wilshere is better in defense. Wilshere has incredible spirit, but not the incredible technical ability that Coutinho does. Coutinho is also way more handsome and cute. 
4. If we can keep Suarez and maybe get a defensive signing or two, and maybe even Diego Costa we have a decent chance of competing for fourth. If we don't sign more players and lose Suarez (especially to Arsenal) we will probably end up 6th. But for now I am optimistic that we can compete with the best in the league.

true,rougecathy,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire (in exile in Surrey),"Right, this thread has made me look up Employment Tribunal Success rates on a Sunday night, curse you all!!  Don't take my word for it, look for yourself at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-tribunal-and-employment-appeal-tribunal-statistics-gb

People are bandying about two figures, one is that only 8% of Unfair Dismissal claims are ""successful"" and the other is that 0% of Equal Pay claims are.

As I suspected, this is comparing claims issued with claims won at a full hearing, which is woefully misleading. Dealing with Unfair Dismissal claims first - while 8% are successful at full hearing, only 10% are unsuccessful at full hearing. What happens to the other claims? 9% are stuck out - that means the tribunal doesn't g on with the claim. This will ususally be because they are presented outside the three month time limit for bringing a claim. Another 3% are dismissed at Pre Hearing Review. This is where there are issues that could cause the whole claim to fail but can be dealt with before a full hearing, for example if the employee wasn't actually an employee, or wasn't dismissed (e.g. they resigned and are trying to claim to have been unfairly dismisssed). So 22% can be said to have ""lost"". Of the rest, 42% are settled through ACAS. This means the employer pays some money to make the claim go away. And 24% are withdrawn. This will usually be after a financial settlement made outside of ACAS, although occasionally you'll withdraw because you realise the case is rubbish and hope the other side don't ask for costs. On the other hand, 0.5% get default judgements, which means the employer never bothered to raise a defence.

The ""whopping 0%"" of successful Equal Pay claims actually represents a non-zero number - 32 claims. Of the 23,800 equal pa yclaims issued, then this rounds down to 0%. How many were unsuccesful at Tribunal? Another whopping zero percent - or 35 if we're counting. 28% are withdrawn and 37% are settled through ACAS. For the breakdown of the rest look at the document in the link, it's late and I'm drinking wine.

So actually more than half and up to 78% of Unfair Dismissal claims  get damages one way or another.
Were the 22% frivalous or jumped up claims? Not all. Losing doesn't mean that you shouldn't have tried. The truely shitty claims should have been dealt with at pre hearing review, but even that 3% isn't all money grabbing. Things that seem really straightforward like ""are you an employee"", ""were you dismissed"" can actually be quite complicated.

TL:DR the majority of Unfair Dismissal claims actually ""win"" one way or another. Most claims settle, if they didn't the ttribunal system would explode. ",0,1375656449,null,0,false,0,cbgydz5,t3_1jojvn,t1_cbgydz5,t3_1jojvn,null,1429945622,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I hope they give some explanation in the show just like they did with Martha and her cousin in Doomsday, what with all the people recognizing him from the Fires of Pompeii episode. Maybe the first time 12 looks into the mirror, he remembers the family from Pompeii, and decides to visit. I'd love to see an episode where the actor of the Doctor has two separate roles, where they interact. If any show could pull it off and make it truly enjoyable and mindblowing, it is this show.

Also I really hope they keep going with the trend of power in the Doctor's timeline. In 9's time, he didn't really want to mess around with the past (example: Father's day). In 10's time he started getting curious, and tried but it backfired on him (example: The Waters of Mars) In 11's time if he wanted something to happen, it happened. (examples: Vincent and the Doctor, A Christmas Carol)

Maybe with 12 they could increase it to going around changing his own timeline (what I highly think they will try to do in the 50th anniversary and change the John Hurt past in between the 8th doctor and the 9th...possibly the Time War) but just like how 10 didn't get his way in the Waters of Mars, maybe 10 and 11 (and any other Doctors whom they bring..I heard Paul McGann filmed some pieces for Doctor Who which could be for the 50th anniversary) weren't able to change the timeline, and 12 single-handedly is able to do it.

true,resonance_frequency,lfc68,,"1. Arsenal has buckets of talent, but lack ruthlessness. RVP was your god because he doesn't give a fuck who he pisses off, he's gonna score. I haven't really looked into how AFC will line up 2 squads (depth) but seeing that they are yet to make a signing, my honest feeling is that LFC have a better 11 now AND more depth.

2. Arsenal would be a step sideways for Suarez. Arsenal are certainly not a bigger club than LFC and I see no way that the London press or Arsenal fans would've ever given Suarez such support in two fucked up cases of suspensions.

3. Wilshire is a fantastic player, but Coutinho is more of a magic attacker front man so comparing them would be redundant, but as pure talent my moneys on Coutinho

4. If Arsenal get no major signings in I honestly feel we have a shot. I'm putting my money on a major meltdown at Old Trafford and Man Utd falling to 5th. If Arsene grows a pair and actually lays the plentiful cash he has on the table for a proper signing Arsenal can celebrate yet another year of 4th and no trophies ... just had to get that jab in ;)

Yay, new job! Doing what, where, and for whom? Soon it will be gig o'clock **all** the time.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Going slow is just as dangerous as going fast. If the speed limit is 60mph, and I come around a blind corner at said 60mph, I am doing NOTHING wrong.

Incorrect...you need to drive to the conditions, if you can't see in advance to stop safely you are driving recklessly or to quickly.

That's why it's a limit and not a target.

What would you do if a tractor was around that corner, or someone crossing the road?


&gt;But what if I come around that corner at said 60mph and there are three cyclists using the entire lane at 15mph so they can have a chat?

3 cyclists or 20 is irrelevant in that situation. If they are on their side of the road (in the lane and not in the opposite lane) then you have time to stop. If you are comming in the opposite direction around a blind corner as long as the many cyclists are in their lane you shouldn't be a problem for you.

If on the other hand the cyclists are in the opposite lane when a car speeds round the corner in that opposite lane and clips one I suspect that's the cyclists fault for not being In lane

&gt;They cause a huge crash, potentially killing me...but hey fuck it...they can do whatever they want because they're cyclists.

Cyclists are not above the law. But the above points would lead me to believe that it's you who caused the accident. I would come to the same conclusion if we replaced the cyclists with a tractor.


I'm not being patantic because I'm a cyclist. These are simply what the Highway Code expects from all drivers.

true,goa7,null,null,"[Cyclecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclecraft) (book) is widely thought of as best practice for cycling. It's very [well](http://www.cyclecraft.co.uk/book_reviews.html) [reviewed](http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/0117037400/) and it's what  the national cycle training scheme is built on. I think you might find the stuff on road positioning useful (this is as excerpt from the '97 edition):

&gt; # Positioning
We have already established that positioning is one of the most important traffic skills for a cyclist to acquire, yet it is precisely here that most cyclists perform badly. Many cyclist fail to position themselves properly because of their fear of traffic, yet ironically, it is this very fear that probably puts them most at risk.

&gt;There are two basic objectives of proper road positioning:


&gt;   * to increase your margin of safety in relation to actual and potential danger by riding where you can obtain the best view, where you can best be seen by others and your movements predicted, and where you may deter movements by others which could be dangerous to yourself;



&gt;   * to allow you to ride as direct a route as possible, conserving your energy and making control of the bicycle as simple as possible.

&gt; **Good road positioning is *not* about keeping you out of the path of other traffic as much as possible.** Contrary to popular belief, this is not necessarily the best way to maximise your safety.

&gt; Many cyclist, and probably the majority of the public at large, dread riding in close proximity to other traffic, because of the fear of being hit from behind. In fact, this type of collision is one of the least likely, accounting for no more than 5% of cycle-car casualties - and many of these are as a result of the cyclist swerving carelessly into traffic. Whilst no method of cycling is completely safe, you should not have to worry too much about rear hist if you cycle competently.

&gt; On the other hand, riding where traffic can see you clearly is likely to reduce your chances of having one of the much more common types of collision, which occur during turning or crossing manoeuvres. More collisions happen because drivers cannot see a cyclist or cannot anticipate the actions of the cyclist than because they do see but fail to take notice.

&gt;An important rule of road sharing is that no one should unnecessarily impede the passage of anyone else. However, you are quite justified in restricting the movements of other vehicles where this is important in protecting yourself, and you should not hesitate to do so when necessary.

&gt;Motorists primarily give their attention to that part of the highway where there is risk to themselves: they are not nearly so good a noticing anything outside their path. This zone of maximum surveillance is often very narrow, especially at higher speeds - it does not extend to much more than the moving traffic lane that the driver is following, plus the moving traffic lanes that are most likely to conflict with the driver's own movement. For you to be safest as a cyclist, you should ride within this zone of maximum surveillance, not outside it.

&gt; To understand positioning, you have to understand the cocept of a moving traffic lane - that part of the carriageway along which through traffic normally moves. It is away from the area occupied by parked vehicles and other obstructions, and dose not necessarily coincide with any markings on the surface. On a free-flowing road where markings are present, the moving traffic lanes are typically centred on the marked lanes, but do not embrace their full width.

&gt;Away from junctions, you should ride in one of two standar positions (see Figure blah), according to circumstances. The **primary riding position** is in the centre of the leftmost moving traffic lane for the direction in which you wish to travel. Here you will be well within the zone of maximum surveillance of both following  drivers and those who might cross your path, and you will have the best two-way visibility of side roads and other features along the road. The road surface will usually be flatter here than it is nearer the edge, with fewer pot-holes and other problems, and this will afford easier control of your cycle. You should be able to maintain the straightest and fastest course without the need to deviate at side roads.

&gt;The primary riding position should therefore be your normal riding position when you can keep up with traffic, when you need to emphasise your presence to traffic ahead, or when you need to prevent following drivers from passing you dangerously.
It is often the best position, too, on roads where there is no following traffic and on multi-lane roads where the traffic flow is light.

&gt;Because the primary riding position can result in some inconvenience to following drivers, it is reasonable to ride further to the left when this could help others, *as long as your own safety is not thereby impaired*. At these times you should adopt the **secondary riding position**, which is about 1 metre (3 feet) to the left of the moving traffic lane if the road is wide, but not closer than 0.5 metres (1. feet) to the edge of any road. Riding closer to the edge would leave you with no room for manoeuvre in the event of an emergency, whilst increasing the need to make unpredictable movements which could lead to a crash. You might also have to endure the discomfort and possible danger of drain covers, edge damage and the debris which tends to collect at the side of the road - and there is no reason why you should have a less comfortable journey than others. Riding too close to the edge can also make you difficult to see for drivers coming out of side roads and drives.

&gt;Only on long streaches of road where there are no side roads, drives or other entrances and you are travelling very slowly (perhaps up a hill) should you allow yourself to ride further to the left than the secondary riding position, but always keep at least 0,5 metres (1.5 feet) from the edge. Conversely, if you are travelling fast, keep further out.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"You seem to be saying, or at least suggesting that having children and going to work are similar things. 

Now, we go to work because we have to. We have to pay taxes, we have to buy food, and our society and economy runs upon it. People go to work out of necessity. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy your job mind, but it does mean that the vast majority do it out of necessity rather than love, and because of this, people should be paid for it.

However, people do not have children because they have to. This isn't the 1950s, where people have to get married, and the woman has to stay at hope and have 2.5 kids. Nowadays, people have children because they want to. This doesn't mean there aren't some people who have children out of necessity, but the vast majority have children out of love rather than necessity, and because of this, people should not be paid for it.

You also then have to look at it from a purely economic standpoint, which is the angle the government will be looking from. 

If a parent is stay at home, this is somebody who is not contributing to the economy. They do not work, therefore do not make earnings, therefore do not get taxed on any earnings. However, if they do go to work, they can be taxed. Plus, if they have any children, they will have to send their children to nursery or something, meaning the nursery gets extra income which can be taxed. Therefore, it is worth more to the government to have someone in work, and someone else looking after their children, than having the parent stay at home.

Whoa. I know another Scot who works in that industry and he's earned a bloody fortune in recent years. Nice work. How does it feel selling your soul?

&gt;An hour?! That's pish! Who was it?

Pelican. 'Haven't you guys ever heard of air conditioning?' It was switched on actually, but I guess US &gt; UK aircon and they couldn't take it. Also, they only played one good tune and the rest were crap. I guess that explains why I struggled so much to find good footage online of them live. There is none. 

&gt;What is this Songkick thing you speak of?...

It's a plug-in to last.fm. It picks up on everything you scrobble and sends you regular emails about newly announced gigs. It gets annoying if you have a tonne of bands, but sometimes it's a god-send. Especially when you know a band will sell out in milliseconds, so you can be there at your PC furiously buying tickets the very moment they are released, cos you've had notice far in advance. 

&gt;Good luck with the application!

Yes we all want better than what we have but in terms of style of play and the types of players needed for that style Arsenal are ahead team wise. I do think Arsenal's squad is too small. A small number of injuries and suspensions cost Arsenal year after year. The 1st 15/16 players, the very top, are better but overall Liverpool's squad players from 16-25/30 are stronger.

2. Yes and no. Arsenal are a top 4 club and a club consistently in the last 16 of the CL, but a lack of a real dominant figure at the back or in the DM role means when push comes to shove they crumble under the pressure.

3. Is Cazorla better than Henderson? Different players in different roles better comparisons would be wiltshere and hendo or cazorla and coutinho

4. All depends on injuries, luck, and in liverpool's case how we turn potential into star players. That said I don't think it'll happen this season but we'll be a lot closer pointswise",0,1375658613,null,0,false,0,cbgz25g,t3_1jp60a,t1_cbgz25g,t3_1jp60a,null,1429945308,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Joeys_Rattata,null,null,"**1, 4.** I think our squads are on about the same level. A couple of years ago Arsenal were definitely stronger than Liverpool, but I feel we've caught up a little. You've lost some key players, while we haven't (yet...). The main difference between our teams right now is Arsene Wenger. He's a great manager, and because he's been there so long he offers a lot of stability. Our poor results lately have come because of too frequent changes in management. The owners have a long term vision now, and hopefully we will improve this season, which I think we will. I think we definitely have a chance to finish above Arsenal this season, but I wouldn't bet on it happening.


**2.** Is Arsenal a step up for Suarez? I don't think it's much of a step up. He'll get to play in the Champions League, but I feel it might be hard for Arsenal to qualify again next season. The competition for CL spots is fierce, and there are three teams that are just flat out better than Arsenal. Also, Arsenal's chances of winning a major trophy this season (PL, CL) are about the same as Liverpool's chances, which are nonexistent. Additionally, if he goes to Arsenal, it'll be hard for him to move again in the next few years, so I think it would be better for him to stay here until a better club comes calling. That said, I'd sell him to anyone as long as we get a massive fee.

**3.** Hard to say. Both players are really hard to judge at the moment. Wilshere has missed out so much in the last few years, and Coutinho only arrived from Inter, where he couldn't get a game, a few months ago.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"&gt;How do Arsenal v Liverpool squads stack up? Is Liverpool's team really better than Arsenal's? I have seen a lot of people claim this and seen some combined 11's(which admittedly would be biased on either side). I mean this in terms of individual players and also the overall team chemistry/make up.

I think they're probably pretty similar, assuming that LFC keeps Suarez. The biggest difference would be in terms of chemistry, since 2/3 of our biggest attacking threats are new additions and the entire team is working within a system and under a manager that's still pretty new to them. That (the fact that studge and coutinho are new and the whole system/manager was new last year) is something I think people forget a lot when they look at how we finished last season and say we're a mid-table club forever.

&gt;Is Arsenal a step up for Suarez? Obviously most of you don't think so, but based on the evidence in recent years, shouldn't it be? Albeit a marginal step up maybe but isn't it a step up nonetheless?

Obviously yes, Arsenal is a step up. However, it's a pretty small one, and with only one or two big ""steps"" really left in his career, I think he'll want to head somewhere that's a more significant step up. I think he wants to be somewhere that's winning their league and competing into the late stages of the CL regularly, not scratching its way (barely) into fourth. That means neither Liverpool nor Arsenal are *really* what he wants, I don't think.

&gt;Is Coutinho better than Wilshere?

I haven't watched a ton of Arsenal matches, so I can't really answer this in an educated way. But Coutinho is really fucking good. 

&gt;What is your level of confidence of surpassing Arsenal this season?

Impossible to say before the transfer window closes. In an ideal world, where we keep Suarez, bring in Costa and maybe Papa? I think our chances are quite good, especially if Arsenal doesn't pick up anyone new. This year everyone's had some time to get used to the system, and I think even without additional reinforcements we have a chance, especially if some of our young guys have a breakout year (I think/hope that this could be the year Raheem Sterling really announces himself as a force to be reckoned with, even though he's still very young).

Of course, if we lose Suarez to Arsenal, that changes the picture dramatically. But I don't think the club will let that happen (I think we'd rather let keeping Suarez blow up in our faces than the alternative), so it depends mostly on who (if anyone) we can lock down over the rest of this window, and who you guys pick up (if anyone). If we lost Suarez to someone else, again, it'll depend on who we can attract to replace him.",0,1375658991,null,0,1375659290,0,cbgz6hw,t3_1jp60a,t1_cbgz6hw,t3_1jp60a,null,1429945252,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

* It would be very easy to spoil. And the BBC has a very, very poor track record of keeping secrets like this even when the audience isn't clamoring to know. The benefit of keeping it secret would be great, but the cost would be very, very hefty.

* Though it would be very cool to happen, it would feel like a disappointment if it didn't. For my own sanity, I'm expecting exactly what they are telling me to expect.
