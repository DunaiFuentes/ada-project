During my high school years (1995-2000), we got the EPL highlights on TV every week, so that was my main source for keeping in touch with football.

Spurs were pretty rubbish in that era, but I saw in them an ethos for attacking football and entertainment, even when George Graham was boring everyone to death at the helm.  The signing of Ginola was the thing that tipped me over the edge.  Even though inconsistent, he was capable of the ridiculous at any given moment.  Goals he scored (heck, even near misses) have stayed with me until this day.

I'm the only Spurs fan I know, but the EPL is well supported amongst my mates, who are mainly Arsenal fans.  So having a bit of local rivalry there has kept the passion alive.

There's something tantalisingly addictive about following Spurs... they always promise so much, but rarely fully deliver.  They acquire some genius players (Ginola, Bale, Berbatov, Modric), but never seem to be able to hold on to them for too long.

I fell in love with their style, the heart aching seasons, good ole 'Arry, and eventually Gareth Bale. Haven't looked back since and I'll be making my way to London from San Francisco some time in 2015 to catch some Tott BPL and UCL games.

true,zingpong,num23,,"I got a job last year as a social studies teacher at an all boys middle school. The school places a lot of importance on the way boys play together, do teachers are encouraged to involve themselves in their games during their breaks and lunches. At 25, I've always been really terrible at sports (more of an indoors guy), but I gravitated towards our soccer field. 

A couple of the guys that played really regularly took it upon themselves to teach me how to play a little, and asked me if I would start watching soccer so that we could talk about it. I took them up on it, in the interest of strengthening our teacher-student relationship. They're mostly Arsenal, Chelsea, and Man City fans but they told me I needed to pick a team to back. They each told me about their teams, but they really did try not to influence my decision. 

I watched one or two games a weekend and didn't really feel any connection to any of the teams. Then I watched the  Tottenham v Swansea match from late March of last season and basically found myself irrationally pulling for Tottenham during the match. Bale's killer goal that match didn't hurt. 

I watched a few more matches before I was sure, but I think it was a combination of strong defensive players, like Vertonghen (I always played defense in the games at school) and pretty decent forwards (Adebayor was already mostly not scoring too well, but I liked Defoe and Bale). The players seemed charismatic and they were fairly balanced, if a little weak in the midfield. I liked the style of play too, and the relative lack of fouls (one of the first matches I watched was Everton, and I pretty quickly knew they weren't for me). 

Long story short, at the end of the year the boys all chipped in and bought me a Bale jersey. They tell me that I play a lot better when I wear it to school (our teacher dress code is very lax), but I don't notice the difference.

Tottenham Hotspur have ordered Gareth Bale to report for training today, thwarting Real Madrid’s plan to introduce the forward to their supporters as their new signing.
&gt;
&gt; The North London club are furious with Real for presuming that a deal for the Welshman had been concluded. A stage was erected near the directors’ box at the Bernabéu last week, from which it was planned that Bale would be handed the No 11 shirt, and the Real website showed replica jerseys bearing the player’s name. Real acknowledged that a mistake had been made on the website and the jerseys were not available for sale at the ground yesterday.
&gt;
&gt; Tottenham, who lost out to Chelsea in the race to sign Willian on Friday, wanted time to complete other deals without selling clubs thinking their funds had already been swelled by the £85 million deal for the Welshman. They believe that Real’s actions have weakened their position in their efforts to sign Hulk, the Zenit St Petersburg striker, and Erik Lamela, the Roma forward.
&gt;
&gt; Bale flew back to London yesterday from Marbella, where he had spent the weekend waiting to travel to Madrid to be introduced as the most expensive player in history. His transfer will eclipse the £80 million that Real paid to Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo four years ago. Bale, who cost £7 million in 2007, has been offered a six-year contract worth about £8.5 million per year after tax.
&gt;
&gt; Real have said privately that it is unthinkable they will not sign Bale, despite Tottenham claiming that they are also considering an offer for the player from another party. Tottenham declined to say when the rival bid was lodged but it is believed that Manchester United offered a deal that paid more money up front than the proposal made by Real.
&gt;
&gt; An offer to pay the £86 million fee over four years was rejected four weeks ago, with Tottenham insisting that the entire sum is paid up front. However, it is unlikely that Tottenham would want Bale to move to a domestic rival, and it appears that they are hoping to exploit the situation to make Real alter their payment schedule.
&gt;
&gt; Tottenham are unhappy about the alleged drip feed of leaks to Marca, the Spanish newspaper closest to Real, that carried nine pages about Bale on Friday and which has also discussed where Bale would fit in and conducted polls on whether other players should be sold. Bale was photographed swimming at the La Trinadad complex in Marbella and having his picture taken with fans.
&gt;
&gt; Real, who defeated Granada 1-0 in La Liga last night, expect to recoup the fee from a deal that entitles them to 50 per cent of the player’s marketing and image rights. They hope Bale will sign in the next 24 hours so that they can sell the broadcast rights and other exclusive pictures of him with his new team-mates, who play a friendly against Deportivo La Coruña on Thursday. Tottenham moved close to finding a replacement after holding talks with Lamela’s agent last night. Roma are asking for £30 million, about £5 million more than Tottenham were willing to pay for the 21-year-old.
&gt;
&gt; Zenit want £40 million for Hulk, about £10 million more than Spurs want to pay for the striker who played under André Villas-Boas at Porto.
&gt;
&gt; Master of the waiting game
&gt;
&gt; Daniel Levy, the Tottenham Hotspur chairman, has proved he will take deals to the wire to get his price.
&gt;
&gt; Luka Modric
&gt;
&gt; Real Madrid’s protracted pursuit ended only four days before the window closed in August 2012. Tottenham, determined not to sell the midfielder to Chelsea, received £27.8 million rising to £33.3 million. Real were keen to avoid a repeat of that situation with Bale.
&gt;
&gt; Dimitar Berbatov
&gt;
&gt; Manchester United spent two months trying to sign the striker, who admitted he was “desperate” during the final hour of the window in September 2008. United were squeezed into paying a club record £30.75 million in a deal announced 38 minutes after the window shut.
&gt;
&gt; Jermain Defoe
&gt;
&gt; The striker admitted defeat in his battle for prominence at Tottenham and made a £9 million move to Portsmouth on the final day of the window in February 2008.

I was singing their praise initially, but after I realised they had failed to move half my direct debits (despite claiming they did - they even told me to go ahead and close my old account) I had to phone around every company I had a debit with. Turns out they failed to instruct them properly. My credit rating almost took a nasty hit and I paid almost £100 in late fees from different companies.

Do not use their 'easyswitch' service. There's a reason banks no longer offer to do this. I totally appreciate I should have done this myself, and it's a lesson learned.

However:

I get the impression they have expanded too rapidly recently and can't keep pace with demand. Up to 10min waits for someone to pick up the phone, their online banking has a habit of being down for maintenance.

Throughout the entire ordeal Barclays were wonderful - and helped me out with letters to other companies etc explaining it was not my fault. First Direct were pathetic and hid behind small print, then had the gall to blame Barclays.

I appreciate this is a one off horror story and I don't think it's a particularly normal experience, but I do note more reviews are popping up with my type of experience. So, please, just be a little bit careful with them. Also note - their signup process is painful.

He gave away SO MANY passes, was absolutely ineffective in every aspect of his game today and was a huge liability on the field.

Hazard was also disappointing and got clowned a LOT. Hazard can be absolutely sublime as we all know but he disappears for stretches and tonight was one of them.

 Almost as bad as Schurrle, but he quasi gets a pass since he was out of position.

Also why the hell did we play schurrle out of position in front of 3 strikers on the bench? Ba is terrible sure, Torres is pretty bad, but sweet mary and joseph Lukaku is a proven premier league striker and is just sitting on the bench. Saying ""torres did ok"" is stockholm syndrome at this point. We shouldn't be wasting our time and effort on a washed up striker when we have such a young talent ready to take the helm in Lukaku. I don't wish ill will in Torres, but shit, the guy has had enough chances to prove himself. Its time to move on.


Those are my biggest issues. I'm ok with a draw with united, and i understand its early in the season so I guess we're all still ok with Jose still experimenting with the squad?

Long Pass: 59. Seriously? 59? Have they not seen him spraying accurate passes since he joined? Mind you, he only has 2 or 3 a game, but it needs to be higher than a 59.

Long shots: 72. Ha. At *least* 80.

Everything else is either fine or needs a bit of a bump. Finishing at 83, Shot power at 82, Ball Control at 81, stamina at 70, Strength at 72, Balance at a 64.

Doesn't really matter what the overall is, just fix the individual stats.

There was a dota seating area, but the colour of it is kinda hard to spot in the seat picker. I'll point it out next time and make people sit there.

If I may hijack your post rather than starting my own: thank you to all the teams who made this event so good.  I had an amazing time (stress aside) and I can't wait for the next one.  If any of you haven't got me on steamfriends feel free to look me up, always happy to play with UK folks (but I am very bad at games).

Schurrle only switched places to plug the gaps when Hazard, Oscar, Big Kev were on the ball to plug up the gaps left by Mourinho instructing players to have more freedom and movement.

I mean I, like yourself, have a fully stocked kitchen, fridge and freezer which does indeed make it pretty easy to eat cheaply because we already have all the basic bits that add up  ( the herbs, the spices, the flour for sauces, the vegetables, the eggs, the milk, the cream, even the damn salt and - for a lot of poor - enough money on the meter to get the job done and let's not forget, the utensils to make it all with ) so we can pretty much just buy the main ingredients and turn a bag of potatoes and a packet of chicken thighs into something wonderful. 

However when the cupboards are completely bare, like nothing in them, and you just need to eat, it's a different story. It's way cheaper to put the grill on and stick a couple of Iceland crispy pancakes under it and a tin of beans on the stove.

In reality, while it's on the basis on Libya, you're right it can't be much like it at all (but still closer to that than the other two mentioned).

I don't think any nation will be actually hostile over something like strikes on their missile facilities for the following reasons.  China likes to make a fuss but ultimately they know where the line is - chemical weapons is that line.  Russia likes to sabre rattle even when the line's crossed, but ultimately don't want to completely destroy relations with Western nations and also appear too opposed to China (who we're assuming tolerate the action).  Iran like to sabre rattle at anything, but ultimately they know if they do something that would bring them in direct conflict with the USA they wouldn't come out best and even in the most minor conflict, it's likely diplomatic pressure from the USA will mean economy will be shut down even worse than it already has been (which they quite clearly already responded to).

The main problem with Syria is that they have been given advanced AA by Russia.  It's not like we can't get around that, but it does mean that only specific targets can be hit rather than loitering in areas of potential conflict like they could in Libya.

Also terrorism.  But they can't be too pissed if we take out the asymmetrical weapons (important thing to remember about those terrorists is that they're not cartoon evil villains - they do what they do because they genuinely think we're the evil people [for irrational reasons  that don't fit with their chosen religion anyway, but hey].  They're the Cromwells of our day, a man who most certainly would be seen as some kind of religious extremist terrorist these days, who unfortunately have ways of causing extreme damage despite small numbers.

People are jumping to the conclusion that because Assad didn't let the UN inspectors in right away, that he's guilty. It's quite possible he didn't want a bunch of UN inspectors killed by rebels, since the attacks happened in rebel controlled areas. 

Hell, it seems it's not that good an idea to let them in considering they came under sniper fire pretty much right away:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23838900

Just ask yourself this, why would Assad give the world a reason? It makes no fucking sense. None at all. 

For months now all the powerful military nations have been saying 'If Syria uses chemical weapons we will intervene militarily..' and then Assad goes and uses chemical weapons anyway? That's fucking retarded. There's no way he's that stupid. 

However, it's clear that the rebels could have seen this warmongering from the western nations and realised that all they needed was a chemical attack that looked like it was from Assad to get the western powers to take care of Assad. 

The rebels are dragging us into this war and everyone's falling for it. 

It's an absolute shame that people in this country are so quick to forget the lies and bullshit that got us into the Iraq war. We should be extremely sceptical for claims like these. The intelligence failure that lead to the Iraq war could easily happen again, and I think it is.

I recently did some work based around the whole idea of 'Northern Irish' as a national identity, some of you may remember me asking about it here.
I can't post the entirety of the study but this is an excerpt from the first draft.

It must be acknowledged that the research carried out has limitations, rather than specific population statistics garnered from the Northern Irish population itself we have opted to identify areas that display both high and low proportions of people identifying as Northern Irish. We have been selective in our samples and cannot provide a detailed overview of Northern Ireland in its entirety; furthermore percentages with Northern Irish as a primary or secondary nationality have also been discounted, which further reduces the sample size. However; excluding the unwanted factors allows for a more detailed scrutiny of areas boasting a comparatively high Northern Irish faction, and for the identification of generalised trends regarding this group. 
It can be concluded that people identifying themselves as Northern Irish are most abundant in areas that contain an Irish majority, therefore geographically the south and west of Northern Ireland will have more ‘Northern Irish’ than the north and east. The implications of this may well have socio-political impacts as the question of national identity reveals a nuanced position within the primarily Irish Catholic community, as noted by the online publication ‘The Detail’. The 2011 census also states that 6.2% of the population regard themselves as British and Northern Irish, while 1.1% consider themselves to be both Irish and Northern Irish. This means that there is a higher prevalence of Northern Irish being considered a completely separate national identity within the non-British population.
Furthermore areas with higher proportions of Catholics are more inclined to have a relatively high percentage of Northern Irish compared to areas that are mostly Protestant in composition. Therefore the Northern Irish population have a majority from a Catholic background; the consequences of this may be that Catholicism may no longer be wholly equated with Irish nationalism. A slightly positive correlation was shown between local government districts with younger average ages and higher percentages of Northern Irish, this fits with the demography of Northern Ireland as the 2011 census showed an increasing Catholic population and a declining Protestant population.

Historically it has been noted that the lines of division in Northern Ireland tend to reinforce each other (Moxon-Browne 1991), however the inclusion of Northern Irish as a national identity may have blurred those lines by creating a pluralistic society with one supra-national identity. The evidence shows that gender and qualification level across all the local government districts analysed have no bearing upon the proportion of Northern Irish present. 
A slight tendency for areas of high unemployment and low economic activity to have lower proportions of Northern Irish people was observed which supports the assertion that political attitudes in Northern Ireland are much less affected by socio-economic class than by religion (Rose 1971).
Therefore the Northern Irish as a group can be assumed the following general traits; a majority of Northern Irish will be found to in the south and west of Northern Ireland, Northern Irish are more likely to be Irish and Catholic than British and Protestant and they are more likely to be present in areas with more youthful population structures.
It is important to note that the 2011 census did not introduce the term Northern Irish as a national identity; rather it can be seen as an acknowledgement of the shifting socio-political situation in Northern Ireland today. Moxon-Browne (1991) notes that as a badge of identity ‘Northern Irish is clearly less divisive than many others. Its attractiveness rests on an inherent ambiguity. Our results have shown that Northern Irish has increasingly been adopted by the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and therefore synonymously the Irish population. For the Catholics Northern Irish can be seen as a geographical distinction from the Republic of Ireland which incurs no sense of cultural dilution. Similarly for the Protestant or Unionist population, Northern Irish as an identity can be drawn directly from Northern Ireland and therefore an indirect inclusion of the UK or Great Britain as a source of their identity. The repercussions of this emerging group of Northern Irish could be decisive in Northern Irelands political future, First Minister Peter Robinson has stated that ‘ a catholic majority want to stay in the Union’ and acknowledged that in the future unionism in Northern Ireland may come to depend upon Catholic votes (BBC). Given that the largest proportions of people identifying as Northern Irish are to be found in local government districts with Catholic majorities, could the Northern Irish emerge as a pro-union faction with a Catholic majority?

I have to wonder about people like you.  Cameron is a 'monster' because he considers, only considers mind, force to prevent chemical weapon attacks.  He has made zero announcements as to what will be done at this point.

So on the one hand Cameron is a monster, and on the other, we have to assume the best about Assad!  

Ignore that he actually has massive stockpiles of chemical weapons.  Ignore that the areas bombed were the rebels own family and children.  Ignore that it takes a huge amount of technical and logistical expertise to mount a chemical weapon attack.  Ignore that nearly every country leader has stated they believe Assad mounted the attack.  

Ignore all that and focus on Cameron is a monster, but don't you say a bad word about poor Mr Assad.  It's a conspiracy by EVERYONE else.  It wasn't just the Russians saying 'use chemical weapons when the inspectors are there, it will draw doubts that you would do such a thing and make people think it was the rebels'

true,wildchild87,null,null,"Well, sit down children, story time.

When I was a little boy I didn't have a lot of interest in football. Being born and raised in Luxembourg, it wasn't for the lack of it, I just didn't give a damn as my favorite passtime was watching 80's action movies. Also, for better understanding, my parents divorced when I was 4. I lived with my mom but saw my dad twice a month and sometimes was on vacation at his place. My mom is luxembourgish, my dad was german.

When I was about 6 or 7, I noticed my girl cousin running around with a red scarf. I asked her what it was and she told it was a football scarf of 1. FC Kaiserslautern. My dad noticed that I had some interest in what this omnious 1. FC Kaiserslautern was and, being a fan of the team himself, he gifted me a scarf of the club. I immediately loved it and wore it all the time for no apparent reason other than my dad giving it to me.

Then came this faithful day when I saw my dad sitting on the couch, watching the DFB-Pokal. I sat next to him and watched Kaiserslautern winning the cup despite being relegated. At that special moment, my interest in football grew. I started watching every match the ""Roten Teufel"" were involved in that was shown on public TV. They gained promotion to the Bundesliga again in 1995 and won the competition itself in 1996. The first and only time somebody achieved this I know of at least.

So, as you can imagine, I was turning into a big style football fan by then. 

As I grew a little older, I started talking about football with my mom, an avid Liverpool supporter. She told me some things about Liverpool and I liked that team to as it's motto was the same as Kaiserslautern's. I didn't stop watching the Bundesliga but always had an eye on the Premier League to see how Liverpool were doing.

In 1999, Jeff Strasser started transferred to Kaiserslautern. I mean, can you imagine, a luxembourgish football player in the highest german division. Amazing. Anyway, I was 12 at the time and now more than ever focussed on Kaiserslautern to see if Strasser did well.

At the same time though, I found a box at home, I opened it and it contained different football scarfs. An uncle of my mom's used to visit England and always brought her a scarf from where he was. I emptied the box and looked at the different scarfs. There were different teams in there, Liverpool of course, ManU, Man City, Leeds, Leicester...(no Arsenal or Chelsea though, the man had a good taste). Those were all cities I knew. But then came the moment, oh this magical moment, when I saw a white scarf in the box. I took it out, awaiting another name of a city I knew but was left confused.

The scarf read Tottenham Hotspur.

After looking at it for sometime, I put the scarfs back into the box and put the box back where I found it and went on with life as usual. But the seed was planted and I couldn't stop thinking about the name of that football club. A few weeks later, I again opened the box, this time just getting out one scarf, the lilywhite one. I started my PC up, waited for the 56 kbit/s modem to set up my connection, went to yahoo (different times, you know) and typed Tottenham Hotspur into the search box. Needless to say, I got scolded for spending over 5 hours on the internet searching for every bit of information about this club. I found out that Sheringham and Klinsmann played for the club, about the meaning of the Hotspur name, the club motto, Bill Nicholson and other things. There was, however, one phrase I read somewhere that stuck out for me: ""In a world full of United's, City's and Rovers, there is only ONE HOTSPUR.""

I always read the sports section in my local newspaper to see how Kaiserslautern played but from that moment, one eye always wandered across the page where the results of the EPL were displayed. I cheered when Spurs won, not knowing why, I just immediately felt some kind of fondness for this Tottenham Hotspur Club.

We eventually got a broadband connection and I could finally follow every detail and every news story about Spurs. I read more and more about them, watched the few videos I could find and listened to match day radio on some obscure website. I started to love the club.

In 2003, my dad passed away. I soon realized I couldn't bear it anymore to also watch Kaiserslautern as it reminded me too much of the fun times we had. From that moment in time, I solely focused on Spurs. I bought my first Tottenham shirt, the Kappa/Thomson one and a new scarf. I did a lot of stupid things during that time but somehow always managed to keep up with Spurs. It was the legacy my dad had given me, he introduced me to football like he introduced me to life and then I went on to make my own path and choices.

I started to watch more games, either at an English pub or on a live stream on the internet. From that moment on I witnessed more and more magical moments. The first win against Chelsea in years, the win of the league cup, the 4-4 draw against the Woolwich Wanderers, Crouchie's goal to get us into the CL, Bale's demolition of Inter... I also witnessed a lot of heartbreaking moments. Losing the cup final against ManU, Chelsea winning the CL and subsequently us missing out on it... 

One thing, never changed and never will, the love I feel for this football club, the moments it makes me live, the players I've seen play, the wonderful goals. It helped me during one of the hardest periods of my life and it became an integral part of it. It kept my love for football alive and I even started watching Kaiserslautern again. For me, it is the most wonderful club to support and I will always be Spurs through and through.

true,Vermis,eng-kent,Tunbridge Wells [Disgusted],"&gt;The basis of their diet, therefore, is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea, and potatoes--an appalling diet. Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let's have three pennorth of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice-cream! Put the kettle on and we'll all have a nice cup of tea! That is how your mind works when you are at the P.A.C. level. White bread-and-marg and sugared tea don't nourish you to any extent, but they are nicer (at least most people think so) than brown bread-and-dripping and cold water. Unemployment is an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated, and especially with tea, the English-man's opium. A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread.

true,themanthatlookedback,null,null,"It's the way the business works. The big boys have the contracts with Samsung, Nokia, Apple etc to buy a set number of phones. Newest phones drive the market so when O2 buy the exclusive to Apple's new phone people flock to O2. After that deal expires then Apple sells more phones across all the other networks. It's all about contracts and the value of a customer over longer periods of time. They acquire the customer through newest phones then retain them with customer service - that's why it used to be a huge pain to switch providers.

Anyway. Once the next product cycle kicks in (usually about a year or so) the big boys still have a load of phones they haven't shifted but are contractually obliged to do so. So they unload these on the quiet to these clearing companies that get a great deal from the carriers. The carriers don't want to be seen off loading year old phones at vastly cheaper rates so they do it under the radar through people like dial a phone.

As part of the deal they don't want these clearing houses drawing attention to themselves and undercutting the 'newest' thing when it becomes available. I see your point about it being anti-consumer but it really isn't. You pay a premium for the latest thing.

This is also what happens in the new car market. Toyota UK buys thousands of cars from Toyota Japan, they then sell these to the dealer groups like RRG for instance. If any of them undersell then they get penalised or rewarded for hitting targets. This is why when the new reg plate comes out the dealers will register all their old stock (to show they hit target) and sometimes off load it to car supermarkets - again, so they don't have basically brand new cars at massive discounts next to their actual brand new cars. It's bad for secondhand values so they keep the market artificially inflated (this isn't really a consideration in the phone market but the side-by-side thing is). If a car supermarket has a deal with Toyota to take their unsold stock under the table they will have it written into their contract that they can't advertise cheap Toyotas in their adverts which is why their adverts are always rather generic.

This business model also applies in online advertising quite often too when a premium website can't sell all its adverts they do deals with networks that sell their inventory for dirt cheap but in secret 'blind' deals where advertisers don't know where their adverts are going but it's just cheap (important in direct response advertising).

&gt;He could do it because he thinks Russia will help more because of the escalation (quite likely considering Russia's relationship with the West) or because he thinks the Russian veto in the UN would be enough to stop it. 

You can see the backlash towards the decision to prepare to intervene at least on here and on /r/worldnews if nowhere else - if he was in tune with the popular opinion in the US and UK, he might think that general noninterference principles or caution after Iraq and Afghanistan would prevent any action really being taken.

One of the main reasons I see people think it was a false flag operation by the rebels is that Assad is supposedly winning. Yes, he probably would win in the end, but at a *very* slow pace - his enemy does not just die, but refills from foreign jihadists all over the region. A closer end to a war (as you're implying; he's not a madman - he doesn't have any spiritual benefit from a never-ending war) at the risk of escalation (but an equal escalation on both sides) would not be a hard decision if I were to make it in his situation.

true,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"&gt; I don't really know. When it all first came out I was fairly in favour of HS2 as think that we really need to do at least something now in order to ensure we have decent rail transportation in the future. However, with predicted costs being so high I can't help but feel it's too high.

I'm of the same mind. At first I was in favour but after a while realised Birmingham doesn't need a 45min link to London. The fares are also concerning.

Apart from the Coventry - Birmingham corridor (decent investment would be to four-track that section although AIUI it's not feasible due to development near the track) the main bottleneck on the WCML is south of Milton Keynes (or may be Watford) into Euston. The WCML was upgraded in 2008 and [the lines around Watford Junction](http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/10579405.Major_rail_works_spell_Watford_Junction_closures_over_next_year/) are being upgraded next year at the cost of weekend closures.

This is why I feel we need a new line, to keep upgrading the classic lines will require a lot of maintenance and cause inconvenience for passengers and I see no reason why that new line shouldn't be HS. What's more a new line which operates independently of other lines ought to be more reliable (like the Chiltern mainline south of Dorridge/Lemington Spa and north of the TfL area). 

All the trains running to the same pattern means you can run a very high frequency as per the Tube at the moment. Whether this will prove useful is questionable because, if the Anytime fares that exist already are anything to go by, it'll be prohibitively expensive and with Advance fares frequency matters not.

&gt; As you say the media is very anti-HS2 but I'm just unsure how true/right any of that is. 

It's frustrating more than anything because as you said you can't tell what's true. Just like HS2 has advantages it has disadvantages: some more legitimate than others which are both brushed under the rug.

&gt; I realise there's current investment, I'm more interested as to how much more investment we could get for another £80bn or whatever the cost is at now. 

I don't think it'd be that much to be honest although for brevity's sake I'm going to stick to the money staying on the railway because upgrading the roads will also just end up with congestion at the new level and, together with air, is environmentally unfriendly It could be used:

1. To buy new stock (including extra carriages for existing stock)
2. To reopen previously closed links
3. Upgrade signalling
4. Upgrade stations (including accommodate longer trains)
5. Additional Electrification
6. Remove level crossings via (foot)bridges or tunnels so trains can operate at higher speed
7. Subsides fares 
8. Buy out a franchise or 2 and return it to directly operated rail as per East Coast
9. Upgrade/Introduce freight lines to get freight off passenger lines

To go through these in a bit more detail:

1. Would be very nice up Pacer land but ultimately useless without 3 and 4 because the signals can only cope with a certain length as can station platforms. 

2. A brilliant idea and one I would love to see happen. Work on the East-West link [has been approved (see source note 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West_Rail_Link#cite_note-Rail_Mag-2) although a while before work starts. There are no doubt plenty of other examples where bringing even a short amount of track back into service will make the system faster or more robust. This will be expensive and may be impossible though where the land has been sold and built upon but certainly worthwhile. May be cheaper to make it freight only to get the freight off passenger lines

3. Will work in the short term but will eventually need doing again (and so on)

4. Lengthening platforms is only worthwhile combined with longer trains but major stations can be upgraded to improve the flow of passengers, stop bottlenecks and improve the rail experience. Gateway Plus is one such example.

5. is decent on paper but most of the trunk routes are already getting electrified or have been done. Most of the remaining routes without wires don't really need them.

6. I am unsure about how many level crossings there are but iirc Network Rail are working on this already. Some places may not need their crossing removed because of a low level of service

7. Not going to happen, the current government has expressed a desire for the taxpayer to reduce their burden

8. A left wing pipe dream which also won't happen

9. An example being the [Felixstowe to Nuneaton scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felixstowe_and_Nuneaton_freight_capacity_scheme#Felixstowe_and_Nuneaton_freight_capacity_scheme) so freight can move more easily and more quickly to reduce the delay on passenger services. Freight operators also have to pay Network Rail to use the rails so can earn some money back as well as potential wider benefits to the economy

&gt; Stage 2/ Y section is really what I support, the London-Birmingham seems a bit unnecessary considering the line that is there already. 

No argument from me there (and I live in Birmingham so would nominally stand to gain). Ideally I'd like to see it reach to Edinburgh and Glasgow at some point. But what route would it take? Would you run it near the Trent Valley lines or send it further east through the East Midlands? If you're going to build it to the Birmingham Interchange then you may as well run to Birmingham to try and earn some business revenue.

&gt; So long as Virgin get to keep it. 

Virgin do very little in running the existing trains, it's Branson's PR that has been the success of their franchise. Stock is owned by the DfT and leased to operators - the latter do not get a say, the staff are TUPEd and would do the same job - for the same hours and pay - under a different operator, the signalling and track is Network Rail.

So rather than attacking the messenger (who does have an eminently punchable face, which I have only just got over wanting to punch after a decade), what about the issue?

This is actually one of the big questions of our time. Why isn't healthy eating a priority for many many people, and how can we as citizens, as a nation and our government move people towards making it one?

Feeding people better food results in better grades, harder workers, more efficient health services, less crime, better prisons etc etc etc. So it is a pretty big one.

Medical care and support has also changed a lot over the same period so more people are living longer with conditions that would have been terminal just 20 years ago. 

In the case of problems (and errors) at birth medical advances have ensured that a great many more babies will survive with lifelong medical conditions, again this is international not just in the UK.

But the fact that we now have a generation that was the first to be raised in the information age and can see the inequalities within our societies, it is interesting that Japan with a low level of social inequality also has low level of disability (as do most counties that have a low level of inequality).  

I would argue that many of these issues are becoming more pronounced as a reflection of the growing awareness of the dysfunctional society we live within combined with the fact that medical advances have contributed to a drop in suicides for that generation.

I agree education is important, but there's also  lot of misleading, duplicitous, unhelpful and frankly downright wrong information out there, some of it even pushed by supposed professionals.  Educating the educators might be a first step.  Add to this, that there are real genuine economic issues, people don't make free choices without an economic context, education can't change that.  There are also less choices available, despite the bewilderingly huge variety of branded offerings.

&gt;However, if you're not buying fresh produce for one reason or another then assuming all chemicals used are declared safe to a reasonable degree by the government and suitably labelled then let people get on with their choices. 

Well, a lot of people don't buy much fresh produce for economic reasons.  Fresh fruit, or example, one of the most important foods for health, is the most expensive basic food type per calorie you can buy.  Then there's storage, fresh produce will rapidly spoil if you don't have sufficient fridge/freezer space on appropriate settings (they're moderately high consumers of electricity, especially old ones and people economise, sometimes inefficiently), that means more time and fuel buying regularly.

I understand that Mata is a great player who brings a lot to Chelsea but Mou obviously see's flaws in his game, If I had to guess I would suggest it's his small frame and lack of defensive contribution. With Willian and Hazard on the wings and Oscar at no.10 he has a hard working attacking mid field that will track back and defend when need be, Willian adds balance to the team in terms of offence and defence with his high work rate. I don't think even Mourinho is so petulant that he'd make a £30m signing out of spite, or fear. In fact I don't think Mou fears any manager or any team, look how he dealt with Barca last year. The only manager Mou has faced and is yet to overcome is Klopp, who he doesn't have to worry about for now. Also, as we ourselves know, once a player decides he wants a move, it is very difficult to stop that from happening, AVB doesn't want to loose Bale, yet he will almost certainly sign for Madrid as it is his wish.

Surely at this stage nothing but the fall of the Assad regime will do for the rebels. Is there are any real calls for peace talks from the most powerful rebel factions? If not (Genuinely don't know) then what is weakening Assad going to actually achieve? 

I completely understand Russias stance on this conflict. The evil you know, and all that. Russia has had enough problems with Chechnya and terrorists to know that Islamic extremists are something you can't tip toe around. It's better to have a dictator in power who won't take any shit from terrorists than an Islamic government that might be sympathetic to their cause. 

I agree, to be honest. When they all stop being so horribly religious, maybe they'll be ready for proper democracy in the middle east. Until then, a dictator will protect our interests and likely the interests of the majority of the middle eastern population better than a Shia democratic government would.One of the major problem with democracy is tyranny of the masses.

You get 6% per annum on the balance which works out at 0.5% per month. Increasing the balance in this way (by £300 per month) gives you interest in this way:  
   300 x 0.005 (half a percent) x 12 (months)
+ 300 x 0.005 x 11  
+ 300 x 0.005 x 10

117/3600 = 0.032 so 3.2% interest over the year, which will be taxed.  

So yeah, if you have a lump sum at the beginning of the year and you keep it somewhere paying no interest and slowly feed it into here you should be comparing 3.2% to other savings accounts. If you're saving £300/month that you otherwise don't save, then you should look at the 6% because you'd be getting the same ratio anywhere else, even if they didn't limit deposits.  

Drip-feeding it from one savings account to this one is a good idea. As for the lasting a year, that's important if you are looking to open another of these, as you'll have to drip-feed back in.

I do see your point though mon amis, he is a bit of a lazy donkey, but he does have his uses, but he'd be more at home at a team like Everton or Villa. He hasn't developed enough at his time a Chelsea to keep us from buying other midfeilders.

People need something they can do instead, poorer folk usually lack that and are attached to their TVs. Attacking that directly is logical but will probably piss people off.

I don't have a local market, to my knowledge. The nearest one is too far away and I'd have to spend far too much time to visit it, I don't want to give that up when I can go to a supermarket nearby. This is life with a full time job and no car. 

I think Jamie's message has something, people almost certainly could eat better and cheaply. My main difficulty is that several generations of my family had no idea how to cook and lack education. My mother stews things into oblivion or sets them on fire. I have a gran who can barely read much less understand even the basics of nutrition.

So my first decade of living as an adult was spent learning a lot of stuff I think could have been taught more efficiently in a Home Economics class and gradually building up some decent kitchen apparatus.. and most importantly, having a kitchen I can actually use. A freezer. Counter space. Hot water. No slugs. I have these nowadays, such luxuries! And of course I learned that I do like vegetables, when they've been prepared in a civilised fashion. 

The other thing is that people are creatures of habit, especially for food. If you were brought up eating a certain way, it takes a long time to change and you need to be convinced and motivated about it. 

As far as priorities go, if you are poor life is rather bleak and you'll take whatever you can to make it bearable. You're not going to spend all of your income on the best food and forego all forms of entertainment.

true,Allthathewrote,null,null,"&gt; Surely at this stage nothing but the fall of the Assad regime will do for the rebels. Is there are any real calls for peace talks from the most powerful rebel factions? If not (Genuinely don't know) then what is weakening Assad going to actually achieve?

I think that the Syrian Opposition Coalition (Not fully representative of the whole opposition movement) have been disingenuous but the question from our (UK) perspective is how do we begin to move them onto a path which is beneficial to our geo-political position in general? If I was a rebel in Syria at the moment I have no real support from the UK so therefore why should I care what we feel they should be doing. 
Weakening Assad, or at least being the party which stops him destroying the rebels also would give us great power over the rebel movement themselves. This also would allow us to concentrate on sidelining some of the worst elements.

&gt;I completely understand Russias stance on this conflict. The evil you know, and all that. Russia has had enough problems with Chechnya and terrorists to know that Islamic extremists are something you can't tip toe around. It's better to have a dictator in power who won't take any shit from terrorists than an Islamic government that might be sympathetic to their cause.

The Russian stance on this is purely geo-political, they want to maintain  access to a warm-water port, they are getting paid quite well for not only their arms but the advisers that they have to keep in place to operate the things (they are now also very good human shields for the Anti-Aircraft installations) and they maintain a good relationship with a key state in the key geo-political theatre. For that they are happy to sacrifice the lives of Syrians.
We should go to Russia with three simple guarantees, 1) Any new Syrian Government would stay within Russia's Sphere of Influence 2) The Warm Water Port of Tartus will be leased to Russian by the new Syrian Government (this has already been offered by the Rebels) 3) No western arms sales. You will see how quickly Russia would get used to life after Assad!

&gt; I agree, to be honest. When they all stop being so horribly religious, maybe they'll be ready for proper democracy in the middle east. Until then, a dictator will protect our interests and likely the interests of the majority of the middle eastern population better than a Shia democratic government would.One of the major problem with democracy is tyranny of the masses. When religion is added to the mix this often means great oppression of religious minorities.

Hobsbawn makes the point in the Age of Revolution that Europeans would view themselves (and each other) through their religious affiliations rather then their Nationality until the French Revolution when things got turned on its head. Marx said that ""It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness"", I think that we have seen in Egypt a rejection by the majority for an overt Islamist 'winner-takes-all' agenda. This comes out of the original struggle against Mubarak, hopefully the Syrian's will eventually have the same change in consciousness although my fear is that the confessional divides are currently too deep.

Nevertheless I will always be on the side of the people and support movements for democracy wherever they arise. A dictatorship is nothing more than the internal occupation of a people, hence the attempt by Assad to liquidate his own citizens because a section has rejected him.",0,1377606891,null,0,false,0,cbw838j,t3_1l6bqj,t1_cbw838j,t1_cbw7ocn,null,1429684710,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Poorer people need to be encouraged to start cooking at home.  Their diets just now, through eating processed, salty and sugary foods are literally killing them.

And yes, it is easy to maintain a healthy diet on a low income.  

*  Cheap cuts of meat from your local butcher (which is far more likely to be local to you than a supermarket, thus keeping travel costs down).  A butcher will prepare the food in a far healthier manner on request; trimming the meat to keep it lean and not adding unnecessary salt.

*  Fruit and veg, wherever you buy it, is cheaper.  An iceberg lettuce, some cheap tomatoes and some other salad ingredients can be combined to last a week, and cost the equivalent of one bag of pre-sliced salad.  For the cost ONE 'luxury' packet meal it is easy to purchase a weeks worth of salad.

I didn't have an affinity at the time for soccer, but I remember the hype of the competition, the caravan of buses with the Spanish players in it rolling down the street to go to the game, and just enjoyed the feeling and atmosphere about the game.  It wasn't until a couple of years later that I could actually watch EPL weekly highlights and got into the game again. I had no particular allegiance to any team, but really liked the Andy Cole/Dwight Yorke combination at United at that time. I ended up going to England for vacation a few years later and had a chance to visit Old Trafford right the summer after they won the treble, and I just slowly kept falling in love with the game. The problem is that had no access to soccer, highlights, or anything again for a few years.


When I finally found out that I had access to the PL in my area, I signed up for the sports package and started watching repeats of the games from the previous season. When the new season started, I kept an open mind and wanted to pick a team.  I went back and forth between a lot with a pretty good intention to NOT pick United, Chelsea, Liverpool, or Arsenal. Tottenham had my interest as everything I looked up on them seemed to indicate a team that was on the up. I liked Robbie Keane, Edgar Davids was playing, and Paul Robinson was either the #1 for England or at least close to it. 


Ultimately though, I think each team has a character and I just loved the character of the team, the club itself, and the fans. They aren't the biggest team, but they had a good history. The fans are passionate with a certain healthy amount of pessimism crossed with humor that I like.

true,rzam,lfc68,,"Good. The one thing I like about Liverpool's transfer dealings thus far (in contrast to our inability to bring in any of our quality targets) is our determination to clear the squad of players who would be identified, for lack of a better term, as deadwood. From Hodgson through Kenny and up to when Rodgers took over last year, the team was littered with players making sizable wages who just weren't earning their keep (remember how desperate we were to get Poulsen, Degen, Konchesky, El Zhar, etc. off the books?) That continued with Comolli's signings, and for me, getting rid of Cole and Adam and Carroll and Downing was a continuation of that trend. 

It's not that I necessarily care for FSG balancing their books (it's their money, and in my opinion they should be spending more at the moment), but when you look around Europe it's absurd how many teams (especially the richer ones) assume the burden of players, often decent ones at that, who can barely break into a match-day squad. Teams usually get rid of these players at the very end of the window, which means that clubs like us that are in need of one or two more signings are able to capitalize by bringing in these guys either on the cheap or on loan (see: Sahin, Nuri as a player we brought in like this, and Aquilani, Alberto as one who we sent out on such a basis for two consecutive years). 

It's good to see Liverpool has taken care of its own dead weight relatively early, which gives the staff more time to focus on the players they have and also a chance to evaluate where they really need to strengthen. As far as Assaidi, you always want signings to pan out (and Rodgers genuinely seemed to be excited to have him on Being Liverpool last year), but the kid looked like tons of pace and just not enough skill and discipline on the ball. Even in the Europa League games, he'd beat a man and get into the box but wouldn't know what to do with it. Rodgers has shown no willingness to feature him at all from preseason onward. Hopefully this revitalizes his career and maybe we get a decent fee from them next summer if he impresses.

The ""rank 1-5"" approach (vs. just a ""rate this 1-5"") is constricting for the user, forcing them to rank all items - user can't skip any, vote indifference, or rate two of them the the same.

The ""pick your top three crests"" options is just a [lazy re-use of the image originally posted here](http://www.evertonfc.com/the-history-of-our-crest), ignoring the fact that a number of these are NOT crests (instead the symbol used on the shirt for a few seasons), and this is far from a comprehensive set of crests used in the history of the club.

The set of questions about what you would like in a badge (NSNO vs full text, shield vs. circle, pick your tower, etc.) presents design options considered in a vacuum, as if you can build a badge (or communicate preference for one) via some sort of multiple-choice a-la-carte approach. I understand the intent, but fail to see how the resulting data would be useful in any way. 

...perhaps I'm overreacting as a fiercely loyal blue who is also a creative professional with experience in surveys, branding, and marketing, but this whole saga has been sloppy from start to finish.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I'll leave it if you don't mind. Everything on that website is utterly ridiculous Alex Jones type conspiracy nonsense. By all means if these people have evidence that the BBC could somehow organise a huge demonstration and corral the people of Egypt (who incidentally couldn't give a shit about the BBC given their country is in turmoil) into doing a news corporations bidding while at the same time swearing tens of thousands of angry Egyptians to utter silence about the whole thing then let me hear it. These people might also want to explain how this helps the BBC whose funding does not depend on views or government approval. Any decrease in the licence fee would have to be justified by the government and if they did lower it, it would not stop BBC news which is a flagship program - they would cut everything else before the news. The level of the licence fee will not effect the BBC's news reporting. 

Problem is that just pulling together strands and soundbites to create a narrative the author want's to believe is not evidence. I think [an XKCD comic](http://www.xkcd.com/258/) put it best:
&gt;Conspiracy theories represent a known glitch in human reasoning. The theories are of course occasionally true, but their truth is completely uncorrelated with the believer’s certainty. For some reason, when people think they’ve uncovered a lie, they raise confirmation bias to an art form. They cut context away from facts and arguments and assemble them into reassuring litanies. And over and over I’ve argued helplessly with smart people consumed by theories they were sure were irrefutable, theories that ultimately proved to be complete fictions. Young earth creationists, the moon landing people, the perpetual motion sub-culture. They all fall into the same pattern.

The guy who wrote this website is not a skeptic; he's not questioning the official line. He's accepting and pushing the anti-government, anti-establishment view whatever that may be. If he was a true skeptic and if he really cared about the truth he would subject the claims of BBC bias to the same scrutiny that he subjects the establishment to. In reality though he doesn't because he doesn't care about truth. He and every other person I seem to see talking about this cares about care only about what they think they know that other's don't. They get a thrill out of thinking they've found out something other's have not and they go deeper and deeper until they lose all connection to reality and truth.

Neither the US or the UK wants Islamists in control and you can be pretty sure they won't let it happen even if that means fighting rebels who seek to take the country by force. Being anti-Assad is not being pro-militia. The incumbent leaders of Syria will be chosen by a peaceful vote. There are many hundreds of thousands of people who have fled the country who want no part in this battle. Those people will return to a peaceful Syria and will hopefully vote for a leader who does not represent either side. 10% of the population is Christian so they will not vote for an Islamist leader and I would have thought that after Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood has no chance.

He's doing a lot of good things to affect the game without the ball, and even though he wasn't great on the ball yesterday, he still managed to help the team.  I think that's the goal of Jose's system, that movement and dedication to the team take precedence over all.

Schurlle looked so much better on the wing and had a great work rate which means maybe we can take off Ramires.  I love his energy and speed, but he's so poor with his touch and passing that sometimes I don't think it's worth it.

I'll be happy when Mikel is back and working with Oscar.  Both are such great calming influences when on the ball and complete their passes well.  Oscar's been such a great worker and willing to defend, play off the ball, and take charge of attacks, he'll be perfect centrally.  Mikel's presence and physicality were sorely missed today.

They cannot afford to buy the TV outright but can afford the death by a thousand cuts of renting it.

The same is true of food. To get cheap food requires a culture of doing it. You don't just suddenly decide to start making properly prepared meals. You are generally raised to do it. Have at first equipment handed down when your parents replaced their old stuff. You do it regularly as part of a family. This stuff doesn't always hold true for poor people. There are enough disruptions to the routine that it never emerges. Without regular practice trying to prepare a cheap meal from scratch is a nightmare. You overspend on stuff you don't need, you don't realise the kind of force multipliers that make the meals cheap (i.e. preparing for 4 rather than 2) and generally get out of the habit.

There is also the pressing infrastructure issues. You've bought all this perishable stuff. Are you going to be able to clear it before it goes off?

&gt; but to use only one of the above to justify curbing someone's freedom

Thing is, people are arrested EVERY day based only on the statement of ONE person, and that is the crime of rape. Because in many cases, ""he said, she said"" IS all the evidence available, and you really don't want potential rapists given carte blanche to do a runner because the testing lab wasn't open until 9am the following day.

Police HAVE to act on a suspicion, put the accused where he can't do any harm, and THEN collect evidence and shit needed for a trial. To suggest it can work any other way will simply lead to a toothless police force, who will let criminals roam the street or do a bunk while they collect evidence that might not always exist. Confessions are a large part of evidence also, how the hell will you get a confession if you don't have the accused in custody ?

What galls me is the way certain interested parties are pretending this is something new, when in fact it's the way it's always worked, and then making out that every single arrest is a ""violation of human rights"", just because they don't agree with the law in question.

When I was 17, a drunken escapade and some graffiti by a girlfriend left me in police cells overnight. I never got a lawyer in that 9 hour period either, and after a suitable talking to about growing up, I was let off with a caution. I never considered it a violation of my human rights, and there was no ""evidence"" to collect - either I confessed, and said I was sorry, or maybe face a magistrates court and a fine / community service. I took the obvious option.

And this whole Guardian Miranda thing is a fucking setup, you know it and I know it. A journalists gay partner (good PC feel-good factor, it's a pity he wasn't a minority also for bonus points.), gets held and detained for 9 hours in an airport, being completely innocent of anything. Yeah, BULLShit.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I agree that evidence should be sought first and David Cameron has said the same thing and it is assumed that the Attorney General will advise the same. It's good that there will also be a debate on the issue too. 

I think there are a number of reason why we didn't intervene earlier. Syria, as far as I know, has not broken any laws up until this point. You are certainly allowed to defend the government against rebels is you see fit and while civilians have been killed it's not been so direct and indiscriminate before. The excuse of collateral damage will always hold up when you are using normal weapons. But with gas, not only is it illegal but you can also be sure that civilians will die in a way you can't be sure if people die in crossfire. It's a serious breach of international law and the most solid evidence of civilians being targeted we have had. The US et al avoided being pulled into discussions like this when the smaller gas attack happened - I genuinely think they are a bit reluctant to go but when there has been such a blatant attack you lose more credibility by letting people suffer than doing something because you will have to claim that it's a complex situation and your gathering evidence etc while everyone else can see clearly what's going on. 

A rebel supported are full of civilians was being shelled and during that shelling gas was released into the rebel held area killing rebel supporters with gas that Assad has stockpiles of. I mean...it's not concrete but it's clear where it point to. I have no doubt that there are intelligence people working on this too but that should hopefully be revealed at least in part once the case for war is made in the debate. William Hague seemed quite happy to put his money where his mouth is so I hope he'll let us know what he knows.

We also have the historical memory of using chemical weapons in the Great War, and the absolute horror they caused even relative to the horrors of trench warfare. They are taboo to us, to the point where they weren't even used during WW2.

Back when the whole country had really bad snow I had my appointment for my annual reassessment. The appt was at 11am and it's 54 miles away. I called up to try and rearrange the assessment but was told that I could not reschedule since I had already rescheduled previously and you can only do so once.

I drove the 54 miles, dropping the 5 kids off at my mums along the way. I got there only to be told that they had no one available to see me due to the weather.  They tried to give me another appt there and then but I had to arrange a baby sitter again so I would have to speak to my Mum and call them. They told me they would send me out a letter and to give them a call.

I called them back up 3 weeks later in the early afternoon to inquire about my appt only to be told that my new appt was that morning at 10am and since I had missed it I would have to fill out a form explaining why.

I eventually received a letter back telling me my ESA had been stopped. The reasons they gave was that I had not showed up for my original appt when I had driven up. Now, this confused me since they fucking reimbursed my petrol money.  They also cited the reason that I had a history of ""trying to avoid the examinations"". They had examined me once before, denied my benefit which I had to appeal, which was denied and then had to go to tribunal where I was eventually awarded it. And then  they pull this shit.

I made the decision to just go on JSA since it's so much less hassle and stress (the fucken stress of dealing with those lying bunch of cunts was unreal) than jumping through hoops for Atos.

They did not take the money, you send it to them in error (You forgot to cancel the Standing Order). Since it was your initial mistake and you are no longer their customer, they are obviously not going to be in a hurry to sort it out, when they can be dealing with customers who actually earn them money.

Could you go in there. If you could then you could sit there and wait until it is resolved. When they can't get rid of you and you are taking up their time, it becomes their problem.

I am guessing for them ""authorised"" means nothing more than the director or manager has signed off on paying it back, it doesn't mean the transfer has happened. Since you are in financial difficulty, maybe ask them to use the Faster Payment service (near instantaneous bank transfer). Business accounts are charged for this, so if they don't want to do it, you could consider offering to take back the amount less the transfer fee of about a fiver, if getting most of the money to allow you to eat now is better for you than getting all of the money in three days or so.

Babylon 5 spoilers follow, though as it's nearly 20 years old now...

This is from memory, so vague and incomplete, but one case where I remember quote along the lines of ""we're not teaching you what to think, just how"" is from Babylon 5, I think by Delenn. She is a Minbari, and they're strongly influenced by the Vorlons. Through most of series 1 to 4, we're led to believe the Vorlons are good ancient aliens, and the Shadows are evil ancient aliens.

In the end, it turns out that after starting out as guardians/guides, both are using all the younger races as pawns in their ideological war.

Perhaps unsurprising, then, that a major part of the Minbari culture is an extreme, ritualistic (and often unquestioning) respect for authority.

Oddly, this ideological war revelation never really led to the Minbari questioning much of their culture. In a way, you're still left believing that the Vorlons were good ancient aliens and their teachings should still be accepted, and the Minbari still appear to be intended as good role models in the usual teaching-naive-moral-lessons aspect of science fiction.

It's not just that the ""just teaching you how"" line can be a lie, it's also that there's often some irony in the way that's pointed out.

Pedro chirivella

New signing from Spain.Young 16 years old midfielder. He plays like Xabi. According to people in Spain one of the best talents in the world 

Jordan Rossiter

16 years old midfield player. Currently playing for U21

Jerome Sinclair

16? years old striker. He is the youngest ever player to have played for Liverpool.

sergi canos

New signing from Barca. Very highly rated.  He can play everywhere in the front. But i think he will be n10

Harry Wilson

Dont know how old is he. 16 I think. People are saying that he is one of the best in U18 but i didnt saw him too much. Maybe this season he can show me how good he is.

Oluwaseyi  Ojo

My favorite player! He is like Ibe and Sterling. Hope he can be as good as them 

All players above have great potential but it doesnt mean anything. They need to work hard. Every one of them can  play in future for top clubs. But its on them.

true,rzam,lfc68,,"You guys are delusional. Rodgers himself came out and said the only thing preventing the club from going all in for Willian was the money. Now, he may have screwed us like he did Spurs in the end anyway, but the point is that the manager himself said financial considerations forced the club to pull out.

Allow me to channel my inner Rafa --

FACT: Our owner just purchased a major American daily newspaper for $70 million in cash. His baseball team is highly profitable and has a $140 million payroll this year. He's not going broke anytime soon.

FACT: The club isn't assuming any long-term debts. Those were cleared out by FSG's purchase, which consisted nearly entirely of debt. That's why Hicks and Gillett were so steamed about the deal, because they barely made any money, if any at all, off the sale. I'm not saying we should pull a Madrid and offer 100 million pounds for a player, because that would potentially affect the club's financial future.

FACT: Liverpool have cleared MILLIONS off the club's wage bill by jettisoning players this summer (Downing and Carroll alone cleared something like 10 million, while Carragher and Reina were replaced with cheaper alternatives). They've also made a 4-6 million pound PROFIT thus far in the summer transfer window.

FACT: I fully support FSG and John Henry's ownership of the club. They've gone about things the right way, have learned from their mistakes, and given full support to Rodgers' project. No devoted fan could ever forget how bad things got in late 2010.

FACT: Liverpool have taken 6 points from the opening 2 games while playing some of the most exciting, fluid football we've seen from the club in a while. They've managed to hold on to their best player in the midst of a summer transfer speculation shit show (or so it looks like) and surrounded him with a top-class strike partner, a blossoming creative maestro, and a squad featuring a top-class mix of  experienced veterans and exciting youngsters who, with a little more help, absolutely CAN make a top four challenge this season.

FACT: Liverpool, as presently constructed, are a longshot to break into the top four. Chelsea, City, and United are locks, barring epic and unforeseeable collapses. Spurs have a better all-around squad this and  are spending unprecendented amounts to bring in high-priced talent to replace the loss of their best player. Arsenal, no matter what anyone says, is still Arsenal -- they'll add before the window closes, defy expectations and probably finish about Spurs as they always have.

FACT: We CANNOT miss out on the top four this season and expect the club to get any closer next year to reestablishing itself as a top European side. To the contrary, we'll only regress further. We've learned as much this year with the targets we've missed out on or been unable to lure, so what makes you think another year without Champions League football will make us any more desirable? Go on all you want about the ""project;"" hell, I believe in it as much as you do, and I fully support Brendan. But results are results, and unless we deliver them, we're only in for more hurt. And no, a mere improvement on 7th place doesn't count. You think the Suarez saga sucked? Wait until clubs start going for Coutinho with the promise of a pay rise and regular Champions League football. You know it'll happen.

AND FINALLY, FACT: FSG have money to spent, and need to spend it on top-class players (a winger, another center back, a defensive midfielder, whatever you like) in order to ensure that this already-formidable team only increases its quality and really starts to scare the shit out of every side they come up against, week in and week out. 

It's inexcusable not to when you consider the circumstances: increasing TV revenues, slashed wage bill, a profit on transfer expenditures. I personally think they're still burnt from giving Comolli a blank check and seeing their money go to absolute shit. Still, they should realize that this is a different squad now. We've gotten off to a great start, are delivering a fantastic product on the field, and have the return of one of the world's best players (for at least another year) to look forward to. Now's not the time to rest on our laurels, but rather to strengthen the team, support the manager's ambitions, and make the investment that better ensures this club's return to glory.

&gt; The court could then ban a suspect from any activity linked to abuse - such as having children in their cars, or entering areas where they are known to target them. Individuals would face up to five years in jail if they break the order.

Basically, we are talking about sentencing people before they have even been charged with anything, let alone convicted - just like the similar control orders for terrorism.

&gt; When I was 17, a drunken escapade and some graffiti by a girlfriend left me in police cells overnight. I never got a lawyer in that 9 hour period either, and after a suitable talking to about growing up, I was let off with a caution. I never considered it a violation of my human rights

That's because it wasn't.  It is well-established that the police can keep you in custody for up to 24 hours after being arrested (or a bit longer if you are suspected of committing a serious crime).  You only have a right to legal advice if they question you.  ""Human rights"" is actually a legal term, not just a phrase people use to describe things they feel they deserve.

&gt; the freedom of the press did not extend to family members, friends, boyfriends or anyone else

I'm not sure there are actually any laws about this.  We all have a right to freedom of expression - people working as journalists (how would you define that anyway?) don't have greater rights than everyone else.

To give them what? Oil? No, Syria is a net importer. Natural resources of any kind? No, there's no such industry in Syria. Your being very cynical and I don't really see anything to justify it in this case. 

&gt;And if you think democracy is going to work
So because fundamentalist Islam has tried to scupper democracy in some places we should just give up on the entire concept? If they can't do it once they'll never do it? Firstly I should remind you that Syria is different to Egypt for example which is the home of the Muslim Brotherhood. There isn't whole lot of reasons to think it will go the same way. Secondly it's worth reminding you that in the West he had dictators too - the absolute monarchs of the medieval years. We took centuries to overcome that and even longer to actually institute democracy in their absence. The idea that the Middle East is incapable of democracy is about as silly as telling Simon De Montford at the battle of Lewis that he may as well give up because if you think the king will allow a parliament he was deluded. And he had 200 years against him not 2. 

&gt;what if...the people vote for Assad?
Assad is in a tiny religious minority who is responsible for the murders of 10s of thousands of people. There is no way in hell people will vote for him if he's even allowed to stand which he probably won't be able to. He's pushing himself closer and closer to a war crimes conviction and he will probably be tried by the Syrians like Mubarak was in Egypt. 

&gt;what the fuck does it have to do with us

Because we in the West are the only people that can stop him and we are the people who wrote the laws he has broken in the last week. If you don't like murdering civilians and you want it to stop and you are the only people able too then the ball is in your court. You either want it to stop enough that you are willing to risk a hit to your reputation and the monetary expense or you don't. What point is there banning chemical weapons or the Geneva convention or war crimes or crime against humanity or even bothering to say in public that you dislike genocide and killing civilians if you don't actually do anything about it? Why even bother? If they're just empty words then why say them? What's the point of the US constitution or the various conventions on war and human rights we have in Europe if we don't really back those ideas up? Why even bother being a country who represents decent ideas at home if we don't actually do anything about their protection when we can. Philosophically, if were OK with Syrians being gassed then we're fine with gassing in general whether to people in the middle east, the east or here in Europe and America. 

If people were being gassed right now in Western Europe what would your reaction be and on what grounds would you object (assuming you would object)? If you refuse to agree that we should back up our principles of human rights, international law and crimes against humanity in Syria then you forfeit your right to similarly object were it happening in Europe. If such rights exist they exist internationally and universally, applying to Syrians and Europeans alike and if we would do something to save humans in Europe (much like we did in the 1940s) then we should do something now. If they don't apply in Syria then they don't apply in Europe or in the UK either. That's what it has to do with us.

Games towards the end of the season, when teams know what they need to do, carry more pressure. Three points in October are easier to earn IMO than three points on the last day of the season when you know you need them to stay up.

Also, comparisons with past seasons aren't always that helpful, as there are strong and weak seasons. For example, one season Derby failed to break double figures, so you'd expect everyone to have more points than usual maybe.

Yes we may have been unlucky, but we've also bottled it a bit, whereas Arsenal were almost faultless towards the end of last season, gathering the momentum to take 4th place.

The back to back defeats to Fulham and Liverpool in March followed by the draw against Wigan in April were when we knew that it was going to be tight for fourth, and we dropped 8 points from those three games.

Hello,

 First of all I'm sorry to write you in English but I don't speak Portuguese. I just read your e-mail regarding my apartment located in : Rua Miguel Bombarda 1 B , 3510-070 Viseu, Portugal.
The apartment is still available , with 2 rooms : 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen and 1 living room (50m2 ). The apartment is in the best conditions, furnished and have all the equipment that you will need including TV and washing machine. I can rent you the apt. for unlimited time. I really want to find a good and responsible tenant and I was hoping if you can send me some personal information's about yourself.
The rent price is 260 Euro p/m including all utilities for as long as you need and the deposit is also Euro 260. The deposit will be returned as soon as you will decide to leave from the apartment (you will have to give me at least 30 days notice). The pets and dogs are ok to me. I bought this apartment for my daughter during her studies in Portugal, but now she's back home in United Kingdom permanently, so I'm renting the place for unlimited time and I left the keys and contract of the apartment, already signed by me, at a company called PlazzaRealestates Imb. RealEstate.
If you want to find more about how this transaction can work please get back to me anytime and I will send you more information step by step.
Here are some pictures of my apt, please click of the link:

  Thank you for your interest and awaiting your reply,

2nd one:

""Hello,
 
The flat is exactly like in the pictures, fully furnished and renovated. Also, very important, the utilities (cold/hot water, electricity, wireless broadband Internet, digital TV, 1 parking spots, dishwasher, garbage disposal, microwave, refrigerator, washing machine, etc.) are INCLUDED in the price of 260 Euro/month.
 Thank you for your reply. Like I have inform you before, the price you shall pay for one month of rent will be 260 Eur + 260 Eur security deposit = 520 Eur, with no extra taxes to pay. I must have one month rent + security deposit from you.You pay this money just for this time and every month you pay just 260 Eur. The money, I want to receive it monthly to my bank account, so I hope it will be no problem for you to wire the money to my bank account. The apartment is ready for you, you will need only to receive the keys and the contract to check it, and see if you like it. Obviously we need a way to complete this deal, that will allow us to make sure we receive what we are after. In order of that I have found a way for us to complete the deal safely and fast, and in this way you will receive the Keys in less than 2 days, if you move fast as well. The solution is provided by a company called PlazzaRealestates Imb. RealEstate ( http://www.plazzarealestates.co.uk/ ), which will handle both payment and delivery of the Keys. I have found a procedure that will allow you to pay for the rent of the apt only after you will receive the keys of it and through this way you will see it and decide if you will stay in the apt or not before I receive my payment. 
 If you agree what i suggested i will tell them that my apartment is already rented and i will keep it for you. If you agree then i must have all the shipping details (full name,full address,city,zip code,country,phone number.) so i will be able to make all the arrangements for the PlazzaRealestates Imb. RealEstate delivery.
  
Let me know your decision and wait news from you.

Many thanks in advance !""",0,1377627743,null,0,false,0,cbwf58s,t3_1l5gz7,t1_cbwf58s,t3_1l5gz7,null,1429681347,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Fiances do not work that way, you gain money over the year and you increase your finical reserves through the follow process. Increase yearly revenue, reduce yearly operational cost, increase the number of sponsors , and other such steps that increase your actual money on hand which enables business to spend that money. 

Also with player signing you have to pay taxes against the transfer cost, pay agent fees and other such fees and taxes. While it is true that it seems that we have made money with player sales is probably far less then what is stated in the media. Please remember that most of these numbers are conjecture based and are not actual expenditure costs.

You do make some valid arguments about things that the club needs to do which some of them I agree with.  If you read the finical reports that Liverpool put out last year as it gives very good insight into the actual money the club spends. As for the Willian deal, its sucks that we missed out again on top signing. Paying Anzhi back the money they played Willian in bonuses is just plain silly.

However, there is no reason why this identification needs to take place in open court; the requirements of justice can be satisfied by going into a side room and having a female police officer ID the defendant.

I agree with most of what you're saying, except I want to clarify that FSG is not as stingy as people are making them out to be.

Let's review this summer's failures:

Mkhitaryan: chose the CL runners up over a club with no European football. Had so much third party ownership that apparently we were never even allowed to speak to the player.

Costa: Chose to stay at a place where he's happy and playing CL football. He's the linchpin of the team now that Falcao is gone, and the team were never interested in selling. You're welcome for the raise Diego...

Willian: worth 27 million. FSG willing to spend 30. A corrupt Russian douchecunt is willing to spend 35 for a player he doesn't need. Spurs were willing to overpay as well but so would we with that Bale money. 

Willian is great, but how can we possibly pay that much for an unproven player, when even ""proven"" players like Carroll can bomb so horribly? The reason he failed, among other things, was because he was not a good fit for our *system*. I believe it's obvious in hindsight. 

The wise thing to do is to spend, but **only** on players who fit your system. Yet this is only one of three things that have to line up: the player must match our system, the player must want to leave, and the club (in most cases) must want/need to sell. This transfer window, there have not been many who fit the mold, for the reasons listed above.

FSG *will* spend money. They spent a lot of money on Carroll, Downing, Henderson, and a wealth of big contract, best-in-the-league baseball players in the decade I've watched them manage the Red Sox. They just take their time. If a player is overvalued, they snipe him at the trade deadline / January window. The wage cutting is not to turn a profit just to buy another yacht, it's to make Liverpool financially stable for long term success. 

I know these guys and I know it's what they're after. It's hard for others to take my word for it, but they gave Boston two championships after an 86 year drought. They want to win *long term*, and this is the way to do it. The answer is not panicking and buying a bunch of good but overpriced players who are not a good fit for our city or style of football.

One thing I agree with you 100% on though (actually there were a lot of things) is that this year is very, very important. Without a good run we will lose Suarez and become even less desirable for top talent.

The over the top through ball is too overpowered, it was very bad in Fifa 11 and some people would only use that method to get in behind defences, I learned how to deal with it but it made the game frustrating as people would spam it. They toned down its effectiveness in 12 but in 13 it's returned (not as bad as 11 though)

The impact engine needs to be refined, when it was introduced in 12 it was brand now and there was some bugs, players brushing off each other would result in a foul, free kicks would be given to the wrong person, penalties can given incredibly easily, bookings are very inconsistent, some fouls that should result in a red card get nothing etc. I thought they'd fix it in 13 but they didn't, if anything it got worse.The number of offensive fouls that occur is incredible.

When you want to pass the ball one way and it goes the complete opposite way, they need to sort out a few bugs like this that you find in the general gamplay.

The 5 minute rule online, I know it's there for lag but if a goal is scored the other person shouldn't be allowed to quit without penalty. It's frustrating playing the ball around waiting for the clock to go past 5 mins.

The quick throw ins, why do they work sometimes and other times they don't? There seems to be no way to control it.

First touch, you can make a perfect pass to someone and they'll cock it up by flicking the ball away. They should tone it down or give players the ability to control it instead of just looking at it doing nothing.

The tippy toe thing, I don't know what to call it, but has your player ever just tip toed forward automatically on the ball for a few seconds and you can't do anything? They need to fix that.

Clubs needs a massive overhaul, we should be able to select or own team and develop the other player instead of just having ""generic model #4"" in every position.

The difference in ability of teams due to their star ranking is too much. Taking on a 5 star team with a four star team is pointless.

The goalkeepers have gotten worse in terms of holding the ball, too often the punch the ball away or fumble it when they could have caught it easily.

Ultimate team, I honestly think it's a bit of a scam. People pay to get packs and 90% of the time they get no good players, I've been lucky enough to pull 2 Iniestas, Silva, Vidic, Ramos, Kompany but I read lots about people who get absoultely nothing. Playing the game itself feels very different to the regular game, there's times when your team is on fire and can seemingly do anything but then at other teams they do not perform at all, it feels like it's working against you, I know when it's my own fault and playing badly but sometimes it feels like it's not under my control. I suspect EA do it to get people to buy more packs but I may be leaning to much into the area of conspiracy theorys.

The servers needed to be sorted out, disconnections for no reason happen too frequently and they take the servers down at ridiculous times.

Also, why do I have to fucking pick the language every single time I start the game? It should save it!

I've been playing Fifa games since I was 8 years old, Fifa International was the first one I got on the Mega Drive and that was about '96 I think, Fifa 98 was unbelievable at the time, as was 2000, from about 2002 to 2007 it dropped off and wasn't great, since Fifa 08 it's been good but at this point I think they've gotten very lazy in developing the game as they know it's going to sell million due to them having no serious competition. Some of the features they come out with each year just seem like marketing buzzwords, I think this year is in relation to shooting, I guarantee I won't feel much difference in the shooting. I wish Konami got their act together and put together another excellent Pro Evo game, it might give EA a kick in the arse.

Anyways, there's a couple of things that could be fixed before they put more effort into celebrations imo. I could probably come up with a lot more, I'd need to be playing the game though, I just wrote out these without thinking too much about it so may come off as rambling and a bit incoherent.",0,1377628999,null,0,false,0,cbwfmyw,t3_1l67il,t1_cbwfmyw,t1_cbweef4,null,1429681117,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I didn't say that I regard him as a monster for his actions to date, but rather *if* his intentions fit certain parameters. Do you not regard those who instigated the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq as monsters? Do you not have a problem with the same people starting another war when they haven't been held accountable for their crimes in the last? Do you *like* the state that those countries are in? One doesn't throw dynamite after a fox in the chicken coup.

I have **only** ever defended Assad in the respect that he hasn't been proven to have launched the chemical weapons attack. I even commented [here](www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/1l2ifs/the_craziest_footage_ive_seen_from_syria_rebels/cbvr9bw?context=3) that he was probably the one who made the gas.  This is the first thread on Cameron/Syria that I've commented in.

You know a lot of countries backed the US regarding WMDs before, right? Or have you been living under a rock for the last 13 years while conspiracies and warcrimes perpetrated by western countries have been continuously exposed? 

Go on though, continue to believe them before they actually present evidence. Let them invade countries in your name and allow them to explain why afterwards.

early 2000's is about when it started while enjoying watching Keane and Defoe score goals... and then when the Berbs came and the delightful link up play with Keane was great to watch. 

Something about the brilliant lightning quick counter attacks that we were so good at only a couple of years ago really attracted me as well as just the pace that many tottenham players are known for such as Lennon, Walker, etc.  

I was sad when Berbatov left for ManU, as well as VDV's departure to Germany. I enjoyed Bale's goals the past season or two, but I am sure we will become better off than the 1 man team we were last season.

So for what should have been a short stay the alternative is to vastly over pay for parking every time. This is just pure greed by the council to screw the people they're supposed to be servicing.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"&gt;I see your *(sic)* suffering from the same problem as a lot of other people; lack of imagination and poor culinary skills.

For what it's worth, I'm an excellent cook and most of my meals use lentils, beans and fresh vegetables.  I eat meat as well, but infrequently because it's expensive.  Much better in my opinion to buy a chorizo for £2-3 which can be used to bring incredible flavour to soups and stews, rather than a kilo of crappy chicken drumsticks which are mostly bone, skin and gristle.  But thank you for making assumptions about my abilities.

&gt;Both the chicken and beef would be used to flesh out currys and stews.
Ah, an excellent idea!  So, let's add to our shopping list: appropriate spices and rice.  The shopping list, and the price, has just increased.

&gt;The bones would be retained and used to make soup and stock for additional vegetarian meals.
Of course, for a halfway decent stock you'll also need carrots, celery, onions and possibly leeks.  All of these will flavour the stock and then be discarded.  Congratulations, you've just burned through a good portion of your veg box.

&gt;If required a cheap pack of lentils could be purchased to further bulk, but really any beans in the veg box would likely suffice.
And thus we add a further ingredient and a further cost to our theoretical shopping list.

&gt;There's easily a weeks worth of cooking. I know, because I've done it.
No, there's not ""easily"" a weeks worth of evening meals for a family of four.  That's just crazy.

I understand where you're coming from, I really do.  A lot of people just don't have the ability to create a meal from a few simple ingredients.  Their skills let them down.  But to pull a shopping list out of your backside and claim that it can feed a family for a week is simply wrong.  Bear in mind that for this theoretical family, this is possibly the largest meal of the day, there isn't an awful lot to go around.",0,1377630082,null,0,false,0,cbwg2kp,t3_1l6bl0,t1_cbwg2kp,t1_cbwdrxg,null,1429680915,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Also, we DO NOT HAVE ALL THE FACTS HERE. There are literally thousands of casee where a claimant has been awarded Incapacity Benefit for life due to... let's say... arthritis. That person then develops a further more serious condition like MS or has a stroke but nobody informs the DWP. What would need to be established here is whether the initial claim to benefit was because of the vegetative state? 

Even if it was, why is it so bad that the DWP would like to stay informed on a claimants condition? 

Also, more morbidly here I know, what if a claimant is awarded ""benefit for life"" and then dies but nobody informs the DWP. Might think that's ridiculous but I assure you that it happens.

Also, if someone is mentally ill or handicapped to the point where they can't handle their affairs then they should not be. Every local council has social workers and there are charities if the said person has no loves ones willing to act on their behalf. If, horrifyingly, they have no support from anyone such as social work then that is a seperate issue but it is not one that the DWP can solve.

This statement makes no sense at all.

The hospital is not liable to undertake this task, the DWP will expect the form filled out - there isn't a random number at the DSS that you can phone and say ""he's brain-damaged"" and they say ""oh, that's ok, then, we'll forget all our procedures and throw away all our bureaucracy and just keep paying him benefit and carers' allowance"".

FWIW the article says he requires ""round the clock care"", but I don't see it saying he's in hospital. I assumed he was being cared for by his parents, but perhaps one of us has misunderstood.  

Your comments indicate you've never had much contact with the social - they'll see you evicted before they'll overlook a form being filled in, they (and the local council) will see you evicted rather than actually step forward to help you. It's probably possible to get a social worker if you're already in the system, but it's laughable to suggest that there's a tonne of them waiting in the aisles, ready to step forward and help newly vulnerable people.

There is a possibility that he started claiming Incapacity Benefit with an entirely different Incapacity and his accident happened since. If he was awarded indefinite Incapacity Benefit for shoulder pain, for example, and then was attacked then there is a chance that the DWP were never even notified because he already had indefinite benefit. You'll notice that the article does not mention when he started claiming Incapacity Benefit.

Like I've already said also, it's not a case of jumping through hoops. One letter from the GP or phone call from the hospital would have sufficed. Does the article mention the ESA113 that's sent to the claimants on GP prior to the form going out? The ESA113 which if was returned by the GP would have prevented the form altogether? No, the GP doesn't directly work on behalf big bad nasty government.

Disabled people can work. Not all disabled people but a lot of them who previously would have qualified for Incapacity Benefit because it was a broken system. I work alongside people with MS, CFS, Fibromyalgia, amputated fingers and COPD just on my one floor and yet there are people out there who claim they are too unfit to work with similar conditions. This is not about asking genuinely ill people to jump through hoops, it's about asking those who can work to do so. A disability is not an automatic right to sit on your arse all your life.

Also, try checking your facts before you look like a dumbass. The Incapacity Benefit Reassessment process was a LABOUR INITIATIVE!

true,Toastlove,eng-lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"No, in the long run it might be best to let the country fragment. Let the Kurds and other ethnic groups have their own states based along their current concentrations. So much violence has been exchanged between groups that bringing the country together again may be an almost impossible task unless another strongman takes control and 
unites it. I doubt democracy will function there for a while.

I don't think we should get involved since we will pick the wrong side like we always do and enable atrocities to take place (remove government forces, rebels roll in and kill everyone seen as loyal to them, which they have been doing already). However we should be more active in limiting what the Gulf states are doing there, it is because of them this war has dragged on so long, without their help the rebellion would of died long ago and stability might start to be restored. Since they seem to have our blessing to do as they please the war has dragged on and things are worse. Not that our governments care about helping there though, they want the situation to be advantageous to them and their allies.

I can't post a link from here but the goal Torres scored against Blackburn (09/10 I think) where he curled the ball from the near side of the box to the opposite top corner.

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"&gt;Britain, France and the US are committing to another disastrous military intervention. Apart from the inevitable casualties, any attack on Syria can only inflame an already disastrous civil war and would risk pulling in regional powers further.

Compared to the current situation, where there is already pretty much all out war and thousands of innocent casualties. An attack could reduce Assad's capability enough that a political option is needed. Not every situation is the same, and you cannot judge each potential deployment the same especially when you have no idea what is being deployed.

What is anti-war in regards to this? If no war is actually declared, where do we draw the line? If we sent in an SAS surgical strike force combined with a missile assault which just decimated Assad's chemical capability, are they against that too? Since we've not been told categorically what our involvement would be, I find it difficult to see what their argument is unless it is simply one of avoiding all involvement no matter what is happening and no matter how many are being killed.

McLaughlin - RB - North-Irishman, I believe he is with our u21s right now not the u18s but one of our highest rated prospects I believe, really aggressive hard tackler and likes to bomb forward as well.

Brewitt - CB - English, 16 year old strong center back, was in the England u16 setup recently, good positionally for his age and can distribute the ball assuredly

Cleary - CB/DR - 17 , Irish, big skillfull committed defender, decent with the ball and possession as well.

Polgar - CB - 16 , Hungarian, brought in from our association with MTK, big powerful central defender, highly rated and expected to make the jump to u18 this season.

Whelan - Def - 15 , Irish, young defender who can play anywhere along the back though I believe central is his preferred. made he u18 debut at 14 last season so big things are expected.

Maguire - LB - 17 , English, been with the club since age 9, really high work rate and fairly dangerous attacker, expected to mostly play u21 I believe

Chirivella - DM/CM - 16 , has been likened in spain to Busquets and more importantly Alonso. good going forward but likes to hold back and dictate midfield, signed from valencia from somewhere between 2-3 million this year.

Phillips - CM - English, I know he's really highly rated and a big part of our u16 setup but don't know much about him,

Kane - CM - 14 (maybe 15 now) , English, signed from bristol earlier this year, was a hotly regarded prospect before we signed him so big things are expected.

Dhanda - CM/AM - 14 , English/Indian, big internet sensation and well known name already, brought in to the west brom set up, arsenal and us tried to sign him, he choose us, really highly rated and is part of england u16 as a 14 year old.

Ojo - AM - 16 , English/Nigerian, very very highly rated prospect the club fought off stiff competition to sign him from MK dons when he was 14, rumoured to be close to have been making his debut for them, has played for England up to u18 level, Power, Pace, Technique, very bright prospect.

Sergi Canos - RW/ST - 16 , young attacker signed from Barca's famed academy this summer after lighting it up for them the last few years, recently scored on his friendly debut against birmingham, very intelligent for his age and finds good attacking positions, also possesses pace and strength.

Wilson - RW - 16 , Welsh, Very highly thought of at the academy, a left footed winger who can play both sides but primarily used on the right for us so far, scored several goals for the u18 last season at 15, very tricky pacey winger with a tendency to cut inside and look for the goal

Kent - LW - 17 (november) , English, read above, possesses similar qualities to Wilson, versatile attacking winger, right footed but comfortable on either wing or as a second striker, moves well with the ball and loves to take a man on, recently starred in our u18s mini derby against everton.

two i have to add myself and just in case anyone doesn't know Jordan Rossiter..

Rossiter - CM - 16 , English, Gerrard comparisons have been flying around when talking about Rossiter, hard playing central mid with a great head and eye for a pass, technically skilled but not afraid to get stuck in when he needs to. Hope he makes he debut at some point today against Notts County. 

Daniel Trickett-Smith - ST/AM - 18 (september) , English, signed from crewe in 2012, forward who is comfortable dropping deep into space and pushing up forward, high level of technique on the ball and on set pieces, moves very well off the ball and should feature often for our u18 squad this term.

Louis Robles - ST - 17 (september) English/Spanish, been at the club since before the age of 9, has a good goalscoring record at every level he has played at for us so far, don't know much else about him besides that he is hotly rated.

Jerome Sinclair - ST - 17 (september) , English, our youngest ever first team player, top scorer in the u18s last season and is part of the u16/17 england setups, apparently is as highly thought of as sterling was/is, should tear it up this season",0,1377633283,null,0,1377634865,0,cbwhdps,t3_1l76lr,t1_cbwhdps,t1_cbweomj,null,1429680304,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

And with these resources as we now know because he lost that war, he was attempting to equip himself with the most terrifying arsenal that it was possible for him to lay his hands on. That's one consequence of anti-war politics, that's what would have happened.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic would have made Bosnia part of a greater Serbia, and Kosovo would have been ethnically cleansed and also annexed. The Taliban would be still in power in Afghanistan if the anti-war movement had been listened to, and al-Qaeda would still be their guests. And Saddam Hussein, with his crime family, would still be privately holding ownership over a terrorized people in a state that's been most aptly described as a concentration camp above ground and a mass grave underneath it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now if I had that record politically, I would be extremely modest, I wouldn't be demanding explanations from those of us who said it's about time that we stop this continual capitulation to dictatorship, to racism, to aggression and to totalitarian ideology. That we will not allow to be appeased in Iraq, the failures in Rwanda, and in Bosnia, and in Afghanistan, and elsewhere. And we take pride in having taken that position, and we take pride in our Iraqi and Kurdish friends who are conducting this struggle, on our behalves I should say.

true,KarmaUK,null,null,"Part of the problem, and I understand your concerns, is that if you fail the test, you're not 'capable of some kind of work', you're immediate judged to be entirely free from any problems and set off to join the workforce with no limitations.  I had 12 points of the required 15, and to start with, it seemed like I may as well have got zero.

I've been fortunate enough to have an advisor now who gives a damn at the Jobcentre, but not everyone will, and those pushed onto work plans from Avanta etc are going to be even worse off, because that's all about money.

I agree something needed to be done about Incapacity Benefit, I sat on it for far too long, too depressed to do anything about it, but at the same time just left alone unchecked.  

However, it's now swung too far the other way and I'm declining due to the pressure of constant need to prove my job search, and never knowing if I've done enough, with it being difficult to find many jobs I feel capable of doing.

I think people blame the Tories because it's the Tories doing it now, and they've increased it.  Also because IDS shows absolutely zero compassion and instead blames the poor for everything from the recession to global warming to One Direction's success.

It would however help if the correspondence received didn't seem quite so hostile too.  We're not criminals, just unfortunate.

I do however disagree with assessing everyone repeatedly, as is obvious, some disabilities or illnesses won't just get better or go away.

Sometimes he forgets the lessons he learned with Ian and Barbara, but not often.  He's done things because he had no choice, and when he has a choice he generally chooses peace.  Unhappily, he doesn't always get that choice.

""He is impulsive, idealistic, ready to risk his life for a worthy cause. He hates tyranny and oppression and anything that is anti-life. He never gives in and he never gives up, however overwhelming the odds against him.
The Doctor believes in good and fights evil. Though often caught up in violent situations, he is a man of peace. He is never cruel or cowardly.
In fact, to put it simply, the Doctor is a hero."" -

How presumptuous. I oppose intervention in the war because I believe it will do more harm than good, not because it costs money.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To completely ignore your question :P ...

Speaking as a UK student; anywhere where there is a university, you won't need a car at all. Public transport is generally good, but in uni towns it is generally even better, as there are so many students with little money. Also, lots of things are within walking distance. For example, the town centre is a 20 minute walk away and there is an 'out of town' supermarket 15 minutes away. It is about 2 minutes to campus and 20 minutes to my department. I basically only ever get the bus if I'm ill or have had a really shitty day.

Over the course of my studies I've probably known ~100 foreign students reasonably well and not one has had a car. He was a mechanical engineering student who bought it as a project. The proportion of students with a car, in my experience, is probably fewer than 1 in 20. If you're going to a uni in a city this number will be even lower.

If I were you, I'd save the money and spend it on travelling around Europe with people you meet in halls at your uni. If you've not heard of it [eurail](http://www.eurail.com/) does rail passes so you can basically have free travel over europe for pretty reasonable rates. Alternatively, package deal holidays work quite well. My ex was a student from Australia - in the holidays she travelled around Europe and had a great time. A good enough time that she's coming back to try and find an internship in January.

and we are back to playing like last year (frustrating!).

Mignolet: Had very little involvement, there was really not much for him to do in either goal.

Wisdom: I thought he was decent today (for his age), he is definitely a very strong guy and I think he has a very promising in the future for us. He needs way more playing time so he can develop properly, and we need a more proven defensive cover.

Kolo: Should have scored, but the post wanted to say hi to us (again).

Agger: Should have scored at least twice, I am not sure if he did not head the ball well enough for it to go in, but that was an unfortunate and too familiar sight here. Fucking post!

Johnson: He did fine in defense, but OH MY GOD is this man terrible in attack! He was too selfish on the ball several times, and doesnt seem to understand when to pass the ball and when to try it on his own.

Allen: Did not contribute much to the game, he looked very mediocre today.

Gerrard: He was probably the best player on the field today, as usual.

Luis Alberto: He was much better on offense, nice vision. He moved ok on defense, but he lacks pace and strength.

Henderson: Great impact from the first few minutes he stepped on the pitch. I liked him a lot today. He was probably the best thing to happen to liverpool today.

Coutinho: He has given very little in the past couple of games, I was very dissapointed with him today, to be honest. I do understand that he cannot be a genius every game tho.

Ibe: I have no idea where this kid was all game, he still has a ton of potential and I have no doubt that he will develop into a promising player, but he showed nothing of value today.

Sterling: Amazing work rate, good foot work, blazing speed, but he is still just a kid and it showed at times in his finishing, passing and choosing the right play. I was happy with his performance today. And he was amazing covering in the back, AMAZING.

Sturridge: Apart from the goal, I think he was very poor today. The play where he tried to control the ball with the chest should have been a diving header or an attempt on goal (or anything but that horrible touch).

Overall I think this game showed how mentally weak the team is. Even after the first goal the team slowed down a bit, after the second goal we went on cruise control when we should have just finished them off. 
We are still a long way from being a solid top 4 team that can compete in every category.

&gt;The basis of their diet, therefore, is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea, and potatoes--an appalling diet. Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let's have three pennorth of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice-cream! Put the kettle on and we'll all have a nice cup of tea! That is how your mind works when you are at the P.A.C. level. White bread-and-marg and sugared tea don't nourish you to any extent, but they are nicer (at least most people think so) than brown bread-and-dripping and cold water. Unemployment is an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated, and especially with tea, the English-man's opium. A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread.

true,Karl_Cross,null,null,"Decison makers are trained to carry out ""decision assurance calls"" in which it should be explained that you are not expected to look for work which you are physically or mentally unable to do. For example, someone with a double leg amputation would not be expected to do certain types of job but they can still be found capable of work. To suggest that someone in this position would be ""immediately judged to be entirely free from any problems"" or limitations is nonsense. You are not judged to have no limitation, just no significant limitations which would render you incapable of working in any capacity. 

Also, try not to put pressure on yourself regarding ""doing enough."" Most staff there should know that it's not easy and provided you can show that you are doing something then you should be okay.

Regarding the correspondence, would you believe a lot of that is not actually as brutal as it really should be. In order to and seem less threatening the forms have to say things like ""if you do not return this form BF223 then your benefit entitlement may be affected."" What that actually means is that you'll be disallowed but because it's less harsh than it should be then a lot of people don't bother and then get angry when they find no payment in the bank. My point is, nobody things benefit claimants are criminals but the DWP has a real hard time at times getting a message across because for the sake of trying to seem less threatening, the actual message gets lost in ""may""'s and ""could""'s.

If you are genuinely verifiably unable to work for life, then you won't be out back in to the assessment process for 3 years.

Stand out positives:

Sturridge continues to be on and looking.

Sterling, if he fell a long long way after this, can get us a goal.

Henderson with a strong run and finish reminiscent of some work from last season. He's clearly most comfortable through the middle.

Johnson was very dangerous down the left. I honestly wonder if it wouldn't be worth Rodgers going for ""inverted"" full backs sometime, with Johnson at left back and Enrique at right. Sounds crazy but I've been trying to think of reasons not to.

Stand out negatives:

Three potential injuries at 3 positions we needed to strengthen already (or, in Cissokho's case, we just strengthened). 

What does Allen offer our side? I watch him play and still can't identify anything positive he contributes. He's basically a body. And he's injured again...

Borini didn't get a run out.

Gerrard, Agger, Sturridge, and Johnson all played the full game. We're only in 3 competitions, with a brief period of time of overlap between all 3, and yet its hard to imagine how we can sustain a season if we can't kill of games and get our key players rest.



While some might say we should have killed the game - and we should have - who could argue about our luck? Just the same, in defense, I don't think either goal suggested a genuine weakness. Obviously they beat us on the counter, but we showed against Villa that when we prepare for a counter team we can be fine.

The exact starting XI against Ipswich will probably line-up on Saturday, as we'll need a real workmanlike performance from the team (I think Eddie Gray reckons that if anyone from tonight's line-up will start, it's Smith), but it's great to see that we have more strength-in-depth than I had thought.",0,1377638995,null,0,false,0,cbwjp6j,t3_1l7cu9,t1_cbwjp6j,t3_1l7cu9,null,1429679150,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"Hi mate, I'm on an A2 licence aswell and have a Honda Hornet restricted to 47bhp - it's a cracking bike but lacks the top end rush I4 engines are famous for when restricted (although it's still plenty brisk enough). My suggestion is a Suzuki SV650 although both the ER6F and Versys are cracking bikes with quite similar motors - the SV being a V-twin handles restriction rather admirably and you can pick one up for a pittance these days. 

In terms of restriction, you're allowed a bike that has up to 94BHP (70KW) as long as you restrict it to 47BHP (35KW) - anything above that you can't restrict as it breaches your license. This stops people buying Hayabusas/GSXR1000 super sports and restricting them down. There's also a power to weight ratio specification, however in my experience almost every single 500cc+ motorbike when restricted fell into accordance with this power to weight restriction - it's mostly there to stop people buying race-bred two strokes and super-lightweight bikes which are essentially still rocket ships even with 47BHP. So as long as you're looking at a bike which weighs over 150KG or so you're in the clear (every bike you've mentioned so far weighs more than that). 

So, in my opinion your best bet is to go for a 500-650cc v-twin/paralell twin sports tourer (of which there are plenty) then restrict it down to the required BHP. Have a good look at SV650s as they're famous for being one of the best bikes to learn on - I very nearly bought one before my Hornet popped up for a price I couldn't refuse. SVs come in various levels of trim, my favourite being the naked version without fairing but there's one with just a bikini fairing and others which are fully faired. Be aware the ones with fairing are the SV650S and have lower clip-on bars making them slightly more sporty but also less comfortable for long hauls. 

A mystery card would also be the Yamaha MT-03 which is 47BHP straight out of the box and an absolute joy to hoon around town with - maybe not as cut out for touring mind, but still worth a look. Only problem is a lack of top end, it'll struggle to get much past 100MPH at full tilt and it's got no fairing but a small screen can have a dramatic effect if you're that way inclined.

I'll have a look into insurance and the like for those sorts of bikes etc.

I really, really like the look of the Versys and the ER6F - I don't want to go ""It's the first one I looked at so it's the one i'm getting"" but I genuinely do like the look of them. The Versys is suited a bit more to touring as well which is nice.

My main issue is lugging a lot of stuff around - I'm going to be back and to between home and uni every day and I've got to bring my normal gear for off the bike, dinner, gym kit, any coursework I need, chain for locking it up, loads of stuff potentially. And going shopping on it.

* Cissokho injury was incredibly unlucky.

* Wisdom just doesn't look very good. Maybe there is potential, but every time I see him play, he just doesn't look good enough. 

* It took me a good 20 minutes to realize that Ibe was on the field. I keep reading that he is a promising talent, but if what we saw today is all he can bring to the table, I just don't see where all the hype is coming from. 

* I think Borini should have come on for Sturridge about the 60th minute. Sturridge looked tired, and with Borini yet to feature in a competitive match, he would have been fresh, full of energy, and therefore difficult for the County defense to deal with. 

* Ideally, I would have liked to have seen Aspas come on for Sterling about the same time, but the Cissokho injury really made tactical subs difficult. 

* Also, to my fellow North Americans: How awful was the beIN commentary?!? They just sounded awkward, like they were fumbling through their sentences and were not sure where to put inflection and emphasis. I heard Notts County referred to as ""Nottingham"" on more than one occasion. I know they are a Nottingham club, but it sounded weird.

I do. The website owners themselves though has not been summoned to court over it and nor has their sight been blocked. They are quite incomparable to the BBC having almost no oversight over what comments people make and relying almost entirely on user reports about complaints and abuse.

But say we do remove Assad, and his family/party loses power. What do you think will happen then? Many of the rebels have shown themselves to be just as violent against civilians as the Assad regime. So you kick out one asshole, and then what? Just leave? A power vacuum in a nation which is facing severe ethnic tension is really a worst case scenario. You have tons of chemical weapons on the ground, which have to be protected from falling into terrorist hands.  Who is going to do that?

The only way to do that is to have troops on the ground. And once the last remains of the 'enemy' are gone, the US is going to want to install someone they like. Except, the Al Qaeda/Al Nusra forces, who have plenty of training and thanks to us, plenty of weapons, aren't going to accept that, so they will start attacking our soldiers.

Lugging stuff is no problem as long as you invest in a topbox/saddle bags/panniers. I have a Givi Monokey topbox which comfortably fits my jacket, gloves, full calf covering boots and overleggings and attach my helmet to the chain which I put around my back wheel for safety - all with a waterproof cover if it's a bit bleak to keep things dry. This way you can also carry your coursework/gym kit with you on the bike or strap it using bungees, then simply take it out to put your gear in and lock it away (Givi topboxes are pretty secure, both from opening and being taken off - using just one key to boot). It takes some mental planning, but I've never had a problem with it - if you decided on some panniers aswell then you could potentially just have everything you needed locked away on your bike no hassle whatsoever i.e. lock the helmet in the topbox for piece of mind.

Messi and Ronaldo are clearly what Chelsea were hoping for when we signed Hazard as the second most expensive player in the club's history after Fernando Torres.

But can you personally place the *entire* blame on him? Even if he had we still would have lost 3-1. The loss to Juve is due to our shaky defense last season and playing a hastily put together 'false 9' formation.

And Mata was clearly a steal for 20m, an exception to the rule. H is easily worth 40+

He can also very consistently dribble around opponents and is usually very hard to dispossess with out fouling.

I never said you did or would.

Hazard is primarily a dribbler who opens up space behind defenders allowing room for overlapping runs by either the CAM or a fullback. He is not supposed to be a great passer. This is why he is a right footed winger on the left: so when he cuts inside he is on his dominant foot.

Messi and Ronaldo set an extremely high standard to live up to, and if that is the standard you are applying to Hazard I can see why you are disappointed. I don't think any Chelsea player, Mata included, live up to that mark.

I think you're judging him on a bad preseason and a bad performance against ManU (where he had two people marking him at all times basically).

We haven't had someone to properly run our attacks through the centre of the pitch since VDV left.  Remember his link up play with Adebayor?  It frequently won us matches.  Bale was our match winner last season, but he wasn't a playmaker.  He usually did it all on his own.

I think we've got some top wingers, but Soldado's not a heading threat because of his height, and playing only one upfront means he can easily be outnumbered and crowded out of the game.  Plus our deliveries from wide (Rose, Chadli, Walker and Lennon) are sometimes a bit more hit and hope than clever distribution of the ball.

With a proper creator in the middle of the park, we can look to play more like Barcelona from a few years ago, where they stretched play down the flanks (particularly the right through Alves), but had plenty of clever movement from tricky, ball-playing midfielders at the top of the opposition box.

Torres does not deliver. He disappears for entire games at time, constantly loses the ball, can't deliver a consistent pass, and drifts out wide. His best quality is his ability to link play up to the midfield, which as a striker, even in our system, is one of the least useful skills to have.

We need to have a solid performer who can challenge defenders playing up front, and for 50m that is nowhere near what we received in Torres. Honestly every critique you're bringing up about Hazard is much more applicable to Torres, who, costing us 15m more, should be even better than Messi or Ronaldo, which is obviously what we were expecting when we bought him.

But this is becoming another Torres argument and I personally would rather not have that.

true,SaradaV,lfc68,,"This year, Liverpool are in three competitions. Obviously Liverpool hasn't qualified for European football so they are all domestic competitions:

**Premier League**: The main league in which Liverpool competes. It is made up of 20 teams, and each team players every other team twice a season, once at home and once away. Each match is decided after 90 minutes (there is no 'overtime') with three points being given for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. There is no knockout stage to the Premier League, the standings at the end of the season are final.

**FA Cup**: The main knockout cup competition in England. Thousands of teams compete from across the country compete for the FA Cup. For each tie, one team is drawn at home and the other away, and the winner after 90 minutes goes through to the next round whilst the loser is knocked out of the competition. If there is no winner after 90 minutes, then a replay is played between the two teams at a later date, at the away team's stadium. If there is a winner after ninety minutes, the winner goes through and the loser is knocked out. If they draw again, then the replay goes to extra time (30 minutes) and if the teams are still drawing after that, then penalties are used to decide the winner. The semi-finals and final are all played at Wembley, and therefore there is no replay and the match goes straight to extra time (and if necessary, penalties) in the event of a draw after 90 minutes.

As a Premier League team, Liverpool get a bye until the third round proper which isn't until January, so Liverpool won't play any FA Cup games over the first half of the season.

**League Cup**: Known as the Capital One Cup for sponsorship reasons, this is the less prestigious knockout cup competition. Only teams from the top four divisions of English football are eligible to play in the League Cup. Like the FA Cup, one team is drawn at home for every tie. However unlike the FA Cup, there are no replays, and if the teams are drawing after ninety minutes (as occurred tonight) they go straight to extra time and then penalties if needed. 

This applies up until the semi-finals, which are played over two matches (known as two 'legs'). This means that one match is played at each team's home stadium, regardless of the result of the first match. At the end of the second match, the results of the two legs are added together, and the team with the most goals on aggregate over the two legs wins and goes through to the final (so if Team A wins their home game 1-0 and draw their away game 1-1, then they win 2-1 on aggregate). In the event of both teams scoring the same number of goals over the two games, the team who scored the most goals away from home wins (so if Team A wins 2-1 at home and lose 1-0 away, then Team B wins the tie as they scored 1 goals away from home where as Team A didn't score any). If both teams score the same number of away goals, then the game goes to extra time. If they are still drawing after extra time (and this includes the same number of away goals) then a penalty shootout is held. 

The final is held at Wembley and if there is no winner after ninety minutes, extra time and, if necessary, penalties are used to decide the winner.

Liverpool get a bye to the second or third round depending on where they finish in the Premier League. The semi-finals and final take place in January/February, so the majority of the games are played in the first half of the season.

true,That_British_Kid,null,null,"Well...a win is a win. Although that's probably about the worst kind of win you can have.

But I think there's a few things people are forgetting:

* This isn't football manager or FIFA. Players don't get tired like that. These guys are some of the fittest players in the world. They have 5 days until the Man U game - only one less than if we had a Sunday league game followed by a Saturday league game. And they'll probably have a rest day. They should be fine. 
* Skrtel (assuming he's fit) played against Man U this time last season and played bloody well. He was one of the better players in that game (alongside Stevie), in all honesty. I won't mind having him there.
* The reason BR played such a strong side is because these cups matter to us now (or more than they did before). They're another route into Europe. We'd all love top 4 or 5, but we have to be realistic. We can't just chuck a potential route into Europe out the door because it's not the prem. Plus, there's always use for the prize money.
* We did actually play fucking well for the first 45 and extra time. If we play like that against *any* team, I'd be happy. Play like that against Man U and they'll have a rough time. It was just from about 50-90 minutes that we played badly (although yes, it was absolutely abysmal).
* We still won, and hopefully it's a wake-up call. Mignolet has hopefully had a wake up call. He's no longer invincible after that magnificent penalty save. To be fair, he did do pretty well. But I felt he could've done more about the first goal. The other players should hopefully realise we need to stop falling asleep after the 1st half. We won't keep winning if we do.

Yes it's horrible that we've lost Kolo, Allen and Aly. And I am annoyed about that. But at the end of the day we're through, and that's better than resting them and being out imho (no doubt I'll get a fair few people who disagree with that). It will also give Rogers a wake up call to get a new CB and DM. Which is also a plus. Soo...

Europa is the 'lesser' of the two competitions and is composed of, uh, um, teams that qualify and how that happens varies a bit by country (e.g. by winning the the League Cup as Swansea did this year and we did the year previous, or by coming in 5th in the final league table, or by placing in the Fair Play league, etc.- the rules for who qualifies are a bit bewildering and I'd hate to even try and explain them past that).  

For Champions League, the 'bigger' of the two European cups, qualification is done by being (generally, although not always) in the top 4 of the final league table.  Note that England has 4 entrants right now (i.e. the 'top 4'), as do Spain and Germany.  However, there is no guarantee that it will always be the top 4 from England- it could well be top 3 in the future as there are only 3 countries who get 4 entrants, then 3 who get 3 entrants, and the rest 2 or 1 depending on a country's standing in the UEFA coefficient table (don't even ask me to explain how that works).

There are all sorts of holes you could poke in his rhetoric.  About why Saddam was our man in the first place, why he lost our trust and support, that he may well have even been tricked into invading Kuwait (i.e. led to believe he had tacit US approval).  We could tally the true extent of the deaths in the Middle East and Asia, and speculate contrarily how much of that was due to our meddling.  Ultimately, whether Assad is a nice man or not, Syria would not currently _be_ unstable if we hadn't invaded Iraq in the first place.

You're in high school and you have a girlfriend who you've been going steady with for a while. She's a bit of a late bloomer, and she's definitely gotten prettier since you've started dating but when you met, her personality won you over and made her seem just as pretty then as she does now. Still, things got off to a rocky start and have only recently smoothed out. It's great now, and during the last quarter of your senior year the two of you go through prom and graduation and have some of your happiest times together. You're starting to think that maybe she's *the one*.

But it's the last summer break before college, and there is some uncertainty now that you aren't distracted by the festivities of your senior year. You know it's a pivotal point in your relationship; she's great and all but you'll be in college, maybe you'll want to fool around for a while or maybe you'll find some girl from outside of your hometown that makes this girl look homely. At the same time, you think that your girl is the girl of your dreams and no one could be better than her and things are only getting better so why stop now? But maybe you're too young and too naive to know better.

Making things worse, she's saying she wouldn't mind ending the relationship now but she's OK with continuing to date, too. She says this is a way where you can figure out that she probably wants to move on. Hearing this, you figure that this relationship has another year to go at best, if you even make it past winter break. You're accepting that she's pretty much gone and the relationship is ending, but you're not sure if you're quite ready to end it yet. You buy her gifts and make romantic gestures all summer to let her know how much she's worth to you, but she's still distant and it's harder than ever to see the relationship continuing. You talk to girls from your new college online and see that many of them are nearly as stunning and charming as your girlfriend is. Your head says ""dump her"", but your heart says ""stay with her"".

This plan goes back many years when Israel and then the US drawn up plans for hegemony in the Middle East coupled with Israel's regional security. Back in 1996, Israel even talked about containing Syria by using proxy fighters and bringing up Syria's WMD's.


""A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the ""Clean Break"" report) is a policy document that was prepared in **1996** by a study group led by **Richard Perle** for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on ""Western values"". **It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"".**

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm)

[The actual policy report](http://www.israeleconomy.org/strat1.htm)

There's no time frame for the attacks stated anywhere and the plan to take out Iraq happened which was also taken as policy a year later after the report for Israel by the US.


""The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in **1997** as a non-profit educational organization founded by **William Kristol** and **Robert Kagan**. The PNAC's stated goal is ""to promote American global leadership.""[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that ""American leadership is both good for America and good for the world"" and support for ""a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.""[2] **With its members in numerous key administrative positions, the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.**

[PNAC Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century)

[Official website](http://www.newamericancentury.org/)


Americas document was thought up and had signatories that have ties to Israel (neocons) and they were also elected after writing this policy recommendation into the Bush Administration.


[Ties to the Bush Administration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Associations_with_Bush_administration)


The same people that are part of all this still continue to sit on think tanks and spread themselves out into satellite organisations and call for intervention in Syria, but it all leads back to the same people.


""But Weiss is not only a blogger. He's also the director of communications and public relations at the Henry Jackson Society, an ultra-ultra-hawkish foreign policy thinktank.

The Henry Jackson Society's international patrons include: James ""ex-CIA boss"" Woolsey, Michael ""homeland security"" Chertoff, **William ""PNAC"" Kristol**, **Robert ""PNAC"" Kagan**', Joshua ""Bomb Iran"" Muravchick, and **Richard ""Prince of Darkness"" Perle**$. The Society is run by Alan Mendoza, chief adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on transatlantic and international security.

The Henry Jackson Society is uncompromising in its ""forward strategy"" towards democracy. And Weiss is in charge of the message. The Henry Jackson Society is proud of its PR chief's far-reaching influence: ""He is the author of the influential report ""Intervention in Syria? An Assessment of Legality, Logistics and Hazards"", which was repurposed and endorsed by the Syrian National Council.""

[Guardian article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking)

Apart from the neocons like Richard Perle, Robert Kagan and William Kristol who have been integral to all the aforementioned, there is people like Michael Weiss who is often interviewed on TV news and he is linked in with the same people who have a central narrative but it appears more and more 'experts' are calling for intervention.

You can pick out more think tanks and find the same people calling for same thing and again, it looks like more experts have asserted it's the right thing to do but the narrative is central coming from a few key people.

I've got every confidence he can seize his chance and I was honestly surprised Rodgers has never really given him that. I think Carragher deserved his time last year and Toure showed up and proved he deserved to start even more. But Skrtel is no slouch and with a chance could show that. 

Wisdom, as everyone seems to agree, isn't ready. I wouldn't mind Kelly getting games at CB but I guess we may not see that for a while. 


All this said, we still need to sign a CB. My hope was that we could hold off and sign one who could put their stamp on the spot for the next 5 years. But its looking unlikely.

I didn't say this. If you are going to quote, at least copy and paste - don't make things up. 

I know my contributions aren't quality, they are intentionally trolling idiots like you who think Downing has done more than Willian. It is because of idiots like you that *other* actual quality contributors who I used to read around here have all left.

You don't approach your statements from the perspective of 'i have never heard of this player, is this player good', they are approached from the perspective of having spent 30 seconds on his wikipedia page, having concluded he has not done as much, then the comment is 'Willian is not good enough, not for £30m'

Never in this forum have I actually heard anybody say 'I have actually never heard of him, can somebody tell me more about him' for *any* transfer traget when it is pretty clear in this forum that 95% of people haven't even heard of players until they are a Liverpool target. This is because everybody here thinks they are so fucking smart, when they are far from it.

But the truth is at this point we've sufficiently established that we don't care at all about 100,000 dead Syrians, and no one in that country will think better of us no matter what we do, so the only grounds for doing anything is to enforce that abstract prohibition of chemical weapons.

to add to what you are saying about coutinho, I think he's just that kind of player. He looks wayyyyy to comfortable ibe and sterling weren't making the kinds of runs he wanted and weren't moving around enough generally towards the end of the game. He's always going to have players closing him down as soon as he gets a touch because of the dribbling abilities he has so unless someone else is making space for him he'll be neutralized he's too small a player but on the plus side he's bound to get us free kicks in the attacking third.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Ok, while I understand this may be pointless, I'm going to respond yet again.

First off, neither of us can truly say if the other is smart or dumb. We can only judge the other based on the posts they make.  For me, you have illustrated that you do not possess an opinion worthy of consideration with regard to football for the following reasons:

1.) You refuse to discuss the merits of a player with an sort of specificity, instead opting to cite your own opinion and then remark at how informed your opinion is versus my very uninformed opinion.

2.) You simply did not--perhaps cannot--understand the initial post I made that got you in a huff about me anyhow.  If you'd please, please re-read it (or perhaps ask for some help from another to help you comprehend it) you'd see I was trying to illustrate how silly it was for people to act like Willian, or any transfer for that matter, is a sure thing and will produce.  To illustrate such a point, I pointed out how Downing, a player who had produced well in the very league in which he would be playing, could be seen as a player with more support for success at Liverpool, yet he was a horrendous flop.

3.) You refuse to actually ever respond to any of my criticisms of your posts, again opting for insults and what amounts to football fan dick-measuring. Honestly, I am happy to concede that you may have watched more matches of Willian, my point was that I have seen some.  I only ever claimed to have seen some Shakhtar CL matches and a few Anzhi matches. The Anzhi matches were last season in the EL, and I do not claim to have watched him at length in any capacity, or even at all in the Ukrainian league or Russian league.  I would say that those performances, unless they are poor or outstanding, would not have much bearing on his likelihood of success at a top club in a top league.

4.) Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, your posts are steeped in irony, in that you claim over and over that I am not an intelligent football poster and should defer to you, and other geniuses like you, despite demonstrating a lack of fundamental football knowledge. You made one of the most ludicrous claims I've seen on this sub this summer (next to the guy who said we should go for Yaya Toure) in saying that wingers shouldn't be judged on goals or assists. Next, the only hint of support for your clairvoyantly accurate opinion of Willian was that many managers and clubs were rumored to be after him.  *Rumored.*  You should be Arda Turan's agent--Liverpool is rumored to be after him every single window and, being of such strong belief that rumors are true, you could do well touting him to other clubs.

In short, there are a host of posters on /r/liverpoolfc that have viewpoints very much outside the mainstream and they put you to shame.  /u/nikcub, for instance, is a poster who I often vehemently disagree with, but he does an excellent job of finding data to support his feelings.  Just today he used last season's passing numbers to cite why he felt Henderson is massively overrated.  You, however, have only said I should trust you.  Perhaps if you gave me even a miniscule tiny scrap of a reason, I would.

&gt;This is report from Doctors without Borders to which Secretary Kerry was presumably referring:

   &gt;&gt; “MSF can neither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack,” said Dr. Janssens. “However, the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events—characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers—strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent. This would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, which absolutely prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons.”

&gt;Note that it is not as conclusive as Kerry suggested, though it is very suggestive.

&gt;Some have asked why the regime would risk using poison gas when it has been making gains against the rebels. But the regime’s advances are minor and tenuous. It only took the small town of Qusayr with Hizbullah help! And ‘advances’ in Homs were just scorched earth destruction of neighborhoods. They were offset by loss of a major air base near Aleppo, key for resupply of troops up there because roads north are insecure. The regime can only advance here or there, but doesn’t have manpower to take back substantial territory.My guess is that rebels in Rif Dimashq in outskirts of the capital were making inroads toward Damascus itself. Defensive troops are off tied down in Homs. Since the capital is the real prize and end game, the regime decided to let them know it wouldn’t be allowed. It is the typical behavior of a weak regime facing superior demographic forces (the Alawites are far outnumbered by Sunnis) to deploy unconventional weaponry. Although there was a risk in using the gas, the regime may have felt threatened enough to take the risk, confident that it could muddy the waters afterwards with charges that it was actually the rebels who were behind it.

&gt;I don’t find the ‘false flag’ narrative about the gas attack put forward by the Russians plausible. Rebel forces are not disciplined enough to be sure of being able to plot and carry out a mass murder of the families that have been sheltering them in East and West Ghouta and to keep it secret. How could they have been sure no one among them would get cold feet and blow the whistle? Killing hundreds of women and children from your own clans would be objectionable to at least some in any group of fighters. The fighters in Rif Dimashq are not the hardened Jabhat al-Nusra types. Besides, capturing and deploying rocket systems tipped with poison gas is not so easy; even just operating them takes training.",0,1377671085,null,0,1377671391,0,cbwuhyt,t3_1l78xl,t1_cbwuhyt,t1_cbwstg3,null,1429674040,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt; If you think that intervention in Syria will cause more harm than good, you don't understand the situation.

I basically agree with everything you say, but I wonder if you could expand on this point.

The situation in Syria is *very* complicated. On the one hand, any intervention would have to anticipate what sort of reaction would come from Russia and China, maybe to a lesser extent Iran? I'm sure when we were talking about supplying the Rebels with arms that Russia promised Syria to send just as many arms more than they already do, and if this has the potential of expanding out of just Syria, maybe we need to think again.

Like I said, I agree with you on the point that the *one* thing we cannot do is stand by and implicitly give the green light on chemical weapons use by the Assad regime. But I'm not convinced by your assertion that thinking that more harm will be done than good means you don't understand the situation, but maybe you know something I don't.

On the other hand, while Assad might be a brutal dictator (frankly I hardly know anything about the man) I gather he is at least a somewhat known quantity. It could be that whoever replaces him is even worse, after all, I'm sure you know as well as I do that the Rebels are not homogeneous force, and there's a strong (and I gather growing) Islamic extremist influence through the opposition movement, and this isn't some Morsi shit.

The other thing is, what exactly will our intervention entail? The Syria conflict has been going on for years already, and if we get involved militarily, what will Russia do? Russia's greatest exertion of influence in the world is through its UN security council veto, and it wouldn't want that undermined, as well as being a strong ally of Assad, how can we predict how Vladimir Putin would react?

And what's our aim? To destroy the chemical weapons? Or just send a few cruise missiles Assad's way and leave, satisfied with having done nothing that wouldn't probably have happened eventually? I don't  remember who appeared on the news today making this point, but he said that to go in without a clear beginning middle and end is like kicking the ball down the field and seeing which way it bounces.

Not to mention our track record of successful Middle-Eastern conflicts, although admittedly that doesn't *necessarily* mean the same would happen in Syria.

His team, 3-4 seasons ago, was the first Ajax team to qualify for CL in over 5 years, and 3 years ago was the first to win the league in 7 years.

&gt;Sure... in a side that's never left the group stage.

Unlucky to do so, considering Real Madrid was in the same group every single time, and they got screwed by Zagreb - Lyon in the second year, last year it was Madrid and Dortmund, but they ended up above City.

&gt;My comment was that I don't feel he's matured enough to lead the attack of a side chasing the Champions League in the EPL of course.

I'd agree, but only because he isn't an attacker.

&gt;The sides competing for CL spots in England are far better than the competition he's up against in Holland.

True, but the players he would have around him are a lot better too, and considering how much better he is than the rest of the players in his team at the moment, at only 21, he would be good enough to start and do well for Spurs, but has the potential to be the star in a few years, and that for only €12-18 million.

I thought that chemical weapons are so much worse than ballistic/conventional weapons because the way in that they kill you is so horrible. 

For example sarin gas, a nerve agent, attacks the way in which your body operates, causing it to turn against itself and the effects of that [are disturbing.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin#Effects_and_treatment)

Ballistic weapons like missiles and bullets don't attack the body in the same way.

1) A huge improvement on last season. This was my first game at Loftus Road this season and I was impressed by the team spirit on display. Rather than giving up after the first goal went in as was so often the case last season we kept trying to win the game for the full 90 minutes.

2) Sean Wright Phillips needs to go. He's go pace but that seems to be about it. I'm getting tired of watching him the run the ball to nowhere or getting muscled off the ball. I was down the other end, but it looked like he missed a sitter one-on-one with the keeper. 

3) Zamora needs to take a pay cut or go. I think he's a useful player to have around but squandered too many chances last night to justify his wages.  

4) No 'plan B'. When Faurlin came off Jenas looked lost and didn't know what to do. The confusion ended up leading to their second goal.

Overall, pretty optimistic about the season ahead and looking forward to seeing Barton and Henry play.

Why?

Considering we don't know in detail what the military plans are, what exactly don't you agree with?

It might be that all we're planning are surgical airstrikes against key Assad targets which could cripple his Military capability and bring the war to a swift close, thus saving the lives of thousands of people down the road. Would you agree with that? 

Of course it might be we get bogged down in another long and ultimately ineffective war like in Iraq. But as I say we don't know yet what exactly they're planning.

I understand why you're against war in general, I don't think anyone in their right mind would actually advocate for war if it wasn't necessary. But in some circumstances it is necessary, and the benefits can outweigh the costs. 

However at this point we simply don't know, so what exactly are you wanting to protest against?

Recent form has been great, Chelsea under Mourinho in combination with new signings and loanees retuning is really fun to watch. But we are not quite there yet with Mata not in form, same goes for our defensive master with beautiful hair, David Luiz. 
We have yet to see a start from Romelu ""The Beast"" Lukaku (everyone expected him to play against United) so that could indicate that his form is not 100% yet, but hey neither is Torres for or Ba so I think we can expect a start form him. 

Starting off strong with 7 out of 9 points only dropping points in a draw against United at Old Trafford I'd say we have a good outlook for the game (hopefully with David Luiz on from start).

What would you say is the average speed for your route?

I admit I always ride as fast as I can, due to my availability issues, it's the only way to get a few extra miles in the same amount of time :P that being said, I'm not super fast and my average MOVING speed is usually between 25 and 28 kph on rides of this length.",0,1377680081,null,0,false,0,cbwvz3k,t3_1l80b1,t1_cbwvz3k,t3_1l80b1,null,1429673352,3,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,3

I'm not expecting he is going to demand sizeable wages so it should be quite feasible that we will be able to loan him out for close to if not 100% of his wages.

Mentioning Loft for Words - my random seat selection (as someone took my ST seat) was right behind the guy who authors their stuff.

One of the knocks against Austin from Burnley fans was his sometimes questionable work rate. I've seen enough positives from him not to be concerned yet, but I worry that his confidence will take a knock while he's awaiting his first proper goal, given that his Exeter goal was very scrappy.

The problem Zamora poses is that we have no alternative big man. I don't see Austin playing the role of a hold-up man, and Johnson and the kids are all small. I also haven't seen Austin and Johnson clicking very well.

Hey don't be harsh on yourself. Our most ardent nationalists have recently been calling for a free movement of labour type of thing with Australia and a move to uh, bring back the british empire? This bloke called nick griffin that runs a relatively popular fascist party said that ""the yanks are ok, we just want to keep the 3rd worlders out!"" and our tea-partiers complain that the problem is European-wide immigration, not immigration from the America. 

The truth is though, that British people are pretty hypocritical. We're *massive* yankophiles and slother ourselves with things like Breaking Bad and The Wire whilst calling all our freinds in the republic uncultured. We get incredibly excited about US elections (you'll find plenty of our twitterati going crazy about the supposed pre-primaries in the republican party right, when it would look obscene for an American to be obsessing over Labour’s anticipated reshuffle). One of the biggest subjects our students study is something called “American studies”, where everything from huckleberry finn to bob Dylan is rigorously examined.  If there were a thing called “british studies” in the US, we’d think it bizarre. From a young age, most of us will have been to Orlando and we’ll spend the rest of our lives saving up to go to NYC, LA or California. Our biggest celebrities tend to retire to the US when they’ve reached a certain level of popularity and you’ll find even our most English of English men (Christopher Hitchens, Stephen Smith, Steven Fry) making documentaries about the American way. 

Don’t ever, every mention any of this to a brit because our patriotism is a lot more intense and a lot more subdued. While it’s socially acceptable to fly your flag outside of your house in the US in a way it isn’t in the UK, it’s equally accepted that anyone can attack America as fair-game in a way that a foreigner wouldn’t be able to attack the UK. 

If you were thinking of moving to the UK because it seems brits are more quaint, quirky, cultured we’re really not. We have an equally painful reality television culture and our middle classes aren’t really much different to yours’.

true,jbubermensch,US,usa,"**Recent Form**

So we haven't lost yet in the regular season, and only lost to Madrid in the preseason (in a game where Madrid were going in far more than us for the win). So in terms of results, the second coming of the Special One has gotten off to a great start. However, in terms of performances, the team's looked a bit dodgier than I would've liked or expected. Despite starting very strongly in the first half of the Hull tie, playing fantastic quick passing and penetrating football, once we had the lead we backed off far more than I would've hoped, and have struggled to really dominate any of our real matches thus far. Though the defense has clearly benefitted from Mourinho's defensive genius, our incredibly strong attacking midfield has been underperforming in my opinion. Though they've been alright, they are not performing close to where they can and will be as they become a more cohesive unit that has adapted to playing together. Our strikers have yet to score this season, which is also a major point of concern (I know, we've only played 3 games, but it's undeniably our weakest link at the moment). We may (fingers crossed) see strengthening in that area by the time the Super Cup comes around. 

**Possible Lineup**

This is tricky, as it really depends on who's training well at the moment. There've been a fair few surprises in Mourinho's team sheets thus far, so there are many possibilities. I'm unsure of why we haven't seen Azpi yet this season (lack of fitness I'd assume), but we could reasonably expect to see him back to deal with Ribery's pace, giving us a best option of Azpi-Iva-Cahill-Cole. I'd be surprised to see Terry starting given his lack of pace. If Luiz is back from his injury our defense could either be Azpi-Iva-Luiz-Cole or Iva-Cahill-Luiz-Cole. In the pivot, I'd be shocked to see Super Frank starting again, given that he's started all three games so far. I like two box-to-box midfielders in the pivot, so my personal preference would be Ramires-Van Ginkel. However I think it's far more likely that we'll see Ramires-Mikel. The attacking band could have any number of combinations depending on whether or not Mata is ready by Friday. If he is I'd like to see Hazard-Mata-De Bruyne. If not it'll likely be Hazard-Oscar-De Bruyne. KdB seems preferred on the right at the moment, and I think that's justified. There is, however, a remote possibility that we might see one of Victor Moses or Willian (if he's ready) on the right, giving us a bit more width and slightly more defensive discipline on Ribery's side. Up front any of the three strikers could be deployed (or even Schurrle/Mata apparently). Depends heavily on who's impressing in training. I'd prefer to see Lukaku but I think it's likely that it'll be Torres (groan).

**Super Cup Trivia**

Don't have much of anything for this one. Chelsea's playing in this match for the second time in a row, does that count? Everyone knows that though. Let's hope for a very different game from last year...

**Key Players**

Players to watch will include whoever starts at forward, as there'll be a lot of expectation to prove that our strikers can handle top quality opposition. Oscar is in great form and generally plays very well in Europe. Hazard is always fun to watch.  And if Mikel starts, look for him to have a far greater defensive influence than people give him credit for. Also if he (ever) scores Blues fans everywhere will go absolutely insane.

true,SaradaV,lfc68,,"As one of the top leagues in Europe (Currently ranked 2nd in the UEFA coefficients table), England ordinarily gets 3 places in the Europa League. The FA allocates these places to the team that finishes 5th in the Premier League, the winners of the FA Cup, and the winners of the League Cup. 

If the winners of either domestic cup competition qualify for Europe by other means (generally by finishing in the top 5 of the league or by winning the other cup competition) then the runners up will get the Europa League place instead (for example, even if Wigan had lost this year's FA Cup Final, they'd have still qualified for the Europa League as Manchester City qualified for the Champions League due to their league position). If both finalists of either domestic cup competition qualify for Europe for other means, then the Europa League place is instead allocated to the team that finishes 6th in the Premier League. And should this situation occur for both domestic cup finals, then the team in 7th place in the Premier League will also qualify for the Europa League.

Now the Fair Play method, which is a bit controversial and looked down upon by some in football. Every game in the top division of every European League is ranked by UEFA according to their fair play criteria, and each team is given a score based on their perceived level of fair play. As well as club rankings within every country, the scores for every team in the league are added up and a league table of nations is compiled. 

At the end of the year, the three leagues with the highest aggregate fair play score amongst their teams get an extra place in the Europa League, and nowadays these are automatically allocated to the team that finishes top of that country's fair play league (or the second team if the first has already qualified for Europe etc). This fair play places have generally gone to clubs from Scandanavia, England or Scotland.

It's a bit controversial for a number of reasons. Firstly, most people believe that qualifying for continental competition should be based on footballing merit only. Secondly, the the way it is assessed is very subjective, with teams being scored on their ""positive play"" for example. And finally, the way it is calculated by country initially means that even if (for example) Liverpool had the highest Fair Play ranking in the whole of Europe, if other clubs in England pulls the league ranking down by having a low Fair Play score (*I'm looking at you Stoke*) and England isn't one of the top three leagues then Liverpool wouldn't get the Europa League place.",0,1377688495,null,0,false,0,cbwwtzp,t3_1l89ra,t1_cbwwtzp,t1_cbwwhh9,null,1429672951,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If no ones checked out Gaelic Football or hurling before I suggest you do, they make footballers look like pansies. It's an amateur sport but my county is playing a semi final against long term rivals this Sunday and there's a crowd of over 80,000 expected.

I can't follow American sports, any time I've tried I've failed, it's goes on for too long and there's too many interruptions for me, Basketball isn't too bad but I couldn't keep up with all the games.

The only other sport I follow then is MMA but that obviously doesn't have teams (not in the traditional sense anyways).",0,1377691149,null,0,false,0,cbwx8tt,t3_1l8q6l,t1_cbwx8tt,t3_1l8q6l,null,1429672728,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
