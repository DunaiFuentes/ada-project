**There was no Anne Frank and if there had been, the Zionists who took out the rest of the non Z Jews would have gassed her too!**

&gt;The J's are fond of telling sob stories about how the wicked Nazi's led by wicked Adolph Hitler, did a job on the Jews, except [AH and the Nazi's were Jews](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3347309,00.html), who perped the Holocaust then went on to establish the illegal modern state of Israel.

&gt;It was a Zionist plot to kill those Jews true to the Divine Covenant, by which Allah assures Jews the Messiah will appear, whose purpose will be to restore the fortunes of the Jewish people, and to establish the nation state of Israel, and exhorts them to patience until that time comes.

**Understand this .. Jews infiltrate the political structure of every land that receives them, then write [Jew friendly legislation,](http://www.reddit.com/r/borntoday/comments/1hqe6u/born_today_july_5th_gyula_horn_politician_prime/caxyx3j) while perpetrating massive horrors on the host population.**

&gt;The non Jewish Nazis Ernst Rohm and the SA hierarchy, were slaughtered in the [Night of the Long Knives Massacre](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/BEST-1934-headline-newspaper-HITLER-PURGES-NAZI-PARTY-Night-of-the-Long-Knives-/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/$%28KGrHqR,!rQE+n0KUv%29%29BQcz%28y8y3g~~60_35.JPG) of June 1934, after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as German Chancellor Jan 31, 1933. 

&gt;They did the same in Russia after instituting the False Flag 1917 Revolution, then slaughtering the Bolshevics whose ""Civil Disobedience"" a la the Civil Disobedience [Rabbi Adam Kokesh](http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/1hsq0o/bobby_powell_adam_kokesh_is_the_gift_that_keeps/caydsw0) is attempting to muster in the US, brought the sham Revolution to fruition!

&gt;It means they were in total power in Germany and the Soviet Union, no less than in France, England, Japan and the United States then as now, where after the similarly [False Flag Pearl Harbor attack of Dec 7, 1941,] (http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1gw8ac/pearl_harbor_cover_up_1000s_of_messages_were/caozrwx) where there were no enemy planes!

&gt;Hitler who was already at war with France, England and Russia, [declared un winnable war on the United States,](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Hitler+declared+war+on+the+United+States&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) Dec 11, 1941!

**The Pharisees caused their own people to be gassed in the millions during WW2, the gassings were selective, only some Jews were gassed!**

&gt;Witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s claim to be a Pharisee, and his contempt for the Jews who were gassed, Cheesies he called them .. Kaplan was a RAAF bomber pilot in WW2, who had flown in the 1945 air raid on [Dresden](http://julius-hensel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dresden-14-2-1945.jpeg), who says his Amsterdam family emerged unscathed.

&gt;After the war he flew Lockheed Electra’s for KLM in Holland and for Lufthansa .. he was the son of a well established Jewish family with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam and in Western Australia, later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking.

&gt;He was the image of the actor who played [Emmanuel Goldstein](http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9674/goldstein.jpg), in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, when I asked him how Radford obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he remained unforthcoming and seemed amused!

**After the war he returned to Amsterdam .. I said it must have been heart rending to go back to empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way!**

&gt;He said it was good, I said sure but what about all his friends and rellies, he said they were fine, I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 

&gt;Indeed The Diary of Anne Frank, a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazi’s was set in Amsterdam, as well Stanley Kramer’s great movie [Ship of Fools](http://mubi.com/films/ship-of-fools), based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s, had its culmination in that city where the ship finally docked.

&gt;After having been turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz gas and death .. Moshe nodded sagely, he told me he was a Pharisee..

&gt;That the Jews of Amsterdam as depicted in The Diary of Anne Frank, were certainly Jews however were not in the same category as him.. they were he told me called Cheesies, since their diet consisted largely of that product.

**That they were missing from the community because they had indeed been gassed, he gave me to understand as far as he was concerned, they were neither missed nor mourned.**

&gt;View the Holocaust as a collaboration of high ranking Pharisee Jews, who provided the finance, the uniforms and the marching songs, and the Nazi’s who would do the dirty work, to reduce the number of those Jews who might if they had the numbers, declare the day of the Pharisee at an end.

&gt;And to clean up any racial minority or dissident group, who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of becoming a threat at some time in the future, so the commos, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies and the lunatic fringe, were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles, and in Hitler’s words exterminated.

&gt;After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs had carried out the dirty deeds were themselves murdered, Ernst Rohm leader of the thug SA movement, murdered with numerous of his thug mates, in the in June 1934 [Night of the Long Knives Massacre.](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/The-Night-Of-The-Long-Knives-ADOLPH-HITLER-Hermann-Goering-NAZIS-1934-Newspaper-/00/s/NTEyWDY0MA==/$%28KGrHqJ,!rIFBPSRPY,LBQYDwbz+cQ~~60_35.JPG)

**The bully boys who did the hands on jobs of thuggery, the scabs of their day, witness the 1929 murder of numerous members of the Gas Fitters Union in Germany.**

&gt;Deeds that were done to empower the Nazis after they had emerged as a political force, with Hitler at their helm in the late 1920’s, murdering, bashing, extorting, and thugging their way along, until the Nazi’s gained absolute power in 1933.

&gt;Then witness the testimony of [Katherine Schweitzer](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/search?q=Katherine+Schweitzer) a Jewish lady from Budapest, whose family of fourteen was arrested in 1944, by a Jew member of Horsha the Hungarian thug police, and deported to Auschwitz.

&gt;Who told Australian 60 Minutes reporter Richard Carleton, the Jew who arrested her was living a few doors up on the same street in Sydney Australia, her murdered body was discovered in a wheely bin inside her high security Sydney apartment, December 28, 2006.

[According to Alex Jones,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAWf4d4hVtw) George Soros then in his teen years, ""cataloged"" the possessions of Jews deported from Budapest at that time .. we say he was ""hands on"" in her case!

&gt;Agger is a terrific ball playing centre back, one of the reasons Barca have been so interested in him. Koscielny has had a decent season which has garnered him some more attention but personally I think he's still below Agger by a fair bit. I think I'll give this to Agger.

I think Koscielny will definitely surprise you this season, and Ramsey will surprise you too if he can keep his consistency from the end of last season.

Also, our left winger at the great run we had at the end of last year was Cazorla, and our CAM was Rosicky. So I think you compared the teams in midfield and attack to an advantage of Liverpool.

Overall I feel a midfield of Arteta, Ramsey, Wilshere, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Podolski and Cazorla is better and have a better understanding than Liverpool's. However Liverpool do have a better Goalkeeper, Striker and better depth in centre defence but our full backs are pretty even.

However I feel because our midfield is stronger and our strength in depth is considerably better I don't think Liverpool could reach Arsenal's standard of last year at 73 points. I do think Liverpool are better this season, but so will Arsenal be (internal development, many will improve because we have a core of young players). Sorry but I just can't see Liverpool getting 70 points, and I can't really see Arsenal getting worse this season simply because we haven't sold anyone!

true,cersclub3,lfc99,,"1) In terms of attacking quality (Suarez, Sturridge, Coutinho) I'd prefer Liverpool to Arsenal's Cazorla, Podolski, and Giroud
2) Arsenal would only be a step up from Liverpool in terms of Champions League footy. It is marginal but because of the fantastic support from the club and supporters Liverpool will always be a step up.
3) Depends on what you like. Wilshere is a fantastic midfielder who can control tempo, make that extra pass but can finish when you need as well. Coutinho can do the same, and to me is a bit more creative. I prefer Cou.
4) I think Liverpool will finally surpass Arsenal now that they've missed out on Higuain and Suarez (as of now). If Liverpool can complete perhaps just one more signing of attacking quality I think it'll be their year.

true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"I agree. I think he is pissed off with the club, but I don't think it's justified. 

  Everything I've heard about Luis from reading interviews with players who he's played with in Uruguay, Netherlands and England has a singular consistency: Suarez want to win, he wants to be the best.

  This works in two ways for us. He strives to defeat the best players in the world, which he can't do in the upcoming season for Liverpool. But if he stays, and when he has played for us in the past, he gives 100% of his energy to winning the game. 

 We are not going to sell him, and his character suggests that, whether or not he wishes to be at Anfield, he'll still give everything he can next season. 

  We can keep him for another season, but unless we win the league next year (which we won't, although I'd climb out if my skin in joy if we did) he'll go, and I don't think any of us could take issue with him if that eventuality arises. 

  Suarez is not a player who will ever just make up the numbers. He wants to be number one, and even if he's playing at a team he'd rather not be at, he'll still be absolutely committed to winning games.

I had such a hard time getting into the series because of this, since I was starting from the 2005 ""reboot."" Looking back, it's still an order of magnitude less terrible than the 1996 movie, and was pretty much par for the course compared to the first seasons of several other low-ish budget, made-for-cable sci-fi shows from the late 90s/early 2000s (I'm looking at you, Stargate SG-1 and Andromeda).

The writers really hit their stride sometime around ""The Doctor Dances,"" which is a damned shame because Eccleston left the show so soon afterward.

true,AzureJahk,null,null,"Doctor Who tries to be a family show that people can enjoy regardless of age but will be childrens show first. It imprints itself on a new generation and when done right, doesn't belittle its audience. People  influenced by it in their childhood can go on to become talented people (such as Neil Gaiman) and are then drawn back to contribute and return the favour.

People may grow out of it or dismiss it as a kids show but years later may find themselves watching it with their kids and are even occasionally rewarded with episodes like Blink. 

The core premise is simple and incredibly flexible. It can be any time period, any genre and isn't afraid to tackle subject matter the 'big boys' won't. It may do it in a hammy way but once that seed is planted in a young stimulated mind its there to stay.

Essentially it survives because it changes with the times. Anything can change and everything will change. If you like this doctor then enjoy him during the brief time hes here, if you hate him then there will be another. Same with the companions, the tardis design, the tone the time period etc. Everything has its brief moment before its gone forever and the show is better for it. [This does a good job of explaining it in an appropriate way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sK5d3oshp8).

“No, look, there's a blue box. It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. It can go anywhere in time and space and sometimes even where it's meant to go. And when it turns up, there's a bloke in it called The Doctor and there will be stuff wrong and he will do his best to sort it out and he will probably succeed 'cause he's awesome. Now sit down, shut up, and watch 'Blink'.”

― Neil Gaiman 

Star Trek is long lived for a lot of the same reasons (Doctor Who was gone for a long time and Star Trek is in a weird place at the moment). It has a central message that is positive, optimistic and forward thinking, which is great. It also has the same problem of being at its worst when it gets bogged down with its own lore and history (Its hard to inspire imagination when its another round of dominion politics or another story about klingons and honor.) 

The advantage Doctor Who has had there is its focused around time travel and isn't trying to be as realistic, so it can rewrite its own lore and handwave the plot holes. Star Trek was at its best when it was inspiring kids but as that audience has gotten older and more invested Star Trek seems to have tried to stay with them, trapping itself within an ever decreasing fansbase. With each new show it tries to fight against that by reinventing itself to a point but sometimes thats not enough and you risk alienating who you already have. Since it sets its shows in different times/places in the same lore its trapped within itself. It may have been very forward thinking at the start but technology has moved on so far in so many unexpected ways it no longer feels like 'the future' and more 'a scifi universe'.

Star Trek has ended up with a nerdy/geek stigma whereas Doctor Who has ended up with a kids show stigma. Kids shows can aim for family shows more easily and even if they fail there is always a new generation coming. Star Trek has more of an uphill battle in that regard.

Jenny's human and Madame Vastra definitely isn't. One of the reasons why they're my favorite non-Doctor/Companion characters is that they're a girl/girl couple, but it's nothing gratuitous. They love each other, it's very obvious that they love each other, and they're not dry-humping each other in the TARDIS.

As for being close friends, I'm always pointing to The Doctor and Donna. They had the best relationship amongst all the Companions. Well... them and The Doctor and Clara. With Clara, I felt after the Cyberman episode that they're two kids running around the universe. If he ever snapped her bra strap, it'd seem very fitting. But Donna's my fave. I feel that she and The Doctor were great pub mates. I could easily see them in a galactic drinking hole slamming glasses, playing the universe's most horrible game of darts, and stumbling to the TARDIS to play old vinyls all night. [That sounds familiar somehow...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_G9yIDG4oo)

But yeah, I wish there were more bits of entertainment that showed men/women and women/men could be close without being *close*. One of the reasons I loved ""Pacific Rim"" is that the heroine never became The Girlfriend. She was someone who fought alongside the hero and they needed each other. It's something I wanna make a point of whenever I can in the stories I tell. That doesn't mean that I'll avoid relationships in my stories, but two people standing together won't mean that they're married.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"We haven't heard anything from Bale's actual mouth that he wants to leave.  However there seems to be a great deal of chatter coming from his agent (granted his agent has a vested interest in Bale moving as he stands to make about £10m off the move), but Bale doesn't seem to be stopping Barnett from saying anything which makes it seem like Bale is at least approving of this communication.

I don't know that we will hear anything from Bale, this whole thing surrounding him being the £100m man has effectively done one thing...it has rocketed his profile up around the world.  His agent is going to go out of his way to make sure there is no sound bites out there from Bale that could seen as negative because that can potentially damage his future marketability, even if it is a minor impact they won't want to risk that rocketing market visibility.  

If Bale doesn't speak and he ends up staying with Spurs he has the ability to say that he is happy to remain and work towards driving Spurs forward and the majority of fans (not just fans of Spurs but neutral around the world) will not be able to see comments that make it seem any other way.  If he moves he can do the ""it was an honor to play for Spurs but i have a new challenge"" and nowhere is there a record of him saying anything different. Means he minimizes brand damage in a transfer.

Personally i am getting the sinking feeling that he may want to move on.  I think AVB statement and the article by Jason Burt was more Spurs making it clear that this will only happen on **our** terms.  We have no problem keeping him here but if Real want him they have to meet our terms so that means our valuation paid the way we want it paid, if they can't do that then they can't have Bale.

IF Suarez goes and we use the money to get Costa, another decent attacking player and centre back, I'll still be confident about challenging for fourth. Obviously it'd be easier with Suarez, but we'll have money to make decent purchases. Like Costa, if it happens. Nobody would have thought we'd be bidding for him, because he's not world renown. But he's definitely CL material. We need to find these kinda of players that go under the radar but are still good enough to be playing in Europe.

1. Arsenal's team/squad is better, or was last season, the league table doesn't lie, although I think it's worth noting that we improved significantly last season following the arrival of Sturridge/Coutinho in January and were showing Champions League form for the last 15 games or so. I think there are 3 teams capable of winning the league (City, Utd, Chelsea) and another 3 on top of that capable of getting top 4, of which we're the least likely and Arsenal are the favourites.

2. It's a step up but only a minor one, which you wouldn't think a player would be willing to burn so many bridges to make. If Suarez is supposedly willing to take Liverpool to court (a club which has faced public ridicule over the level of support they've showed him) to move to Arsenal then you'd have to assume he'd have no qualms about doing the same in a year or 2 in order to secure a move to the dozen or so clubs better situated for short term success. Neither club has good prospects for winning major trophies in the short term, which is why it makes so little sense (imo) to move now when he could hang on a year and get a much better move. I think he's too good for a team that finished 7th but also too good for one that barely scraped into 4th and hasn't won a domestic cup in 8 years, a league title in 9 or a European Cup ever.

3. Both world class talents, it remains to be seen who will be better in the longterm, I'm a huge fan of Wilshere but I'm not sure I'd swap Coutinho for anyone in his age group given the form he's showed since being here.

A majority is more likely to be formed based on the pre-existence of a similar system, meaning that the more filtering they can get away with now, the more filtering they will be able to get away with in future.

Even inasmuch as this isn't going to solve any actual problems in terms of viewing the content we wish to view, the mere fact that this opt-out censorship will likely remain on for a significant part of the population is concerning. With broad categories such as 'esoteric material', 'web forums' and such, it will be the case that information is being controlled on an unprecedented level for those who simply lack the know-how or ability (given, for example, parental control) to opt out.

I suggest the BBFC analogy is flawed in that they show a distinct lack of any particular agenda. In short, neither authority has much to gain from demonstrating a bias towards or against any specific brand of media. The BBFC doesn't have to worry about fringe certification bodies impinging on its right to certify. With the infrastructure in place, it would be trivial to begin adding sites deemed politically volatile ('extreme') to the blacklist and expanding slowly from there. 

As I say, it's a road that, once travelled, will not be easy to return by.

Children of Earth could easily have been missed by the Doctor and companions (only five days, resolved with minimal casualties), but Clara would certainly have been aware of it and there's no way two months of immortality could be missed. And the whole 'the cracks erased all of it' gets less and less likely when you consider the whole Evil Organization from Miracle Day and FBI Guy becoming another fixed point.

You're absolutely right! Had English and Irish roommates in Texas way back when. Sort of followed Liverpool earlier because they were so enthusiastic about it.

I was teasing him a bit that Liverpool were going to lose, but after watching the lightning start and Robbie all over the place I was hooked. Robbie for the 4th goal I think I screamed my head off that I think I popped a blood vessel in my head. You could see him ghosting in and bam! That was a looooong time ago.

Still sad to hear him officially say it, but he's got a great family and a great agent, Mr. Scott who's set him up proper for the rest of his life.

Having a title like [Spoiler titles](#s ""Why I think the Peter will be a good 12th"") states it as a fact that a new doctor has been cast. It leaves no doubt.

There isn't a ban on mentioning a 12th, it's how it's worded.

If your husband has property in the UK, keep it if at all possible. It's an anchor. 
You'll need to be supportive. Understand that he may want to return to the UK from time to time simply because he feels like it. 
Skype and VOIP services are a godsend for keeping in touch with friends and family. 
As Yumineko says, be prepared to order for him. Often it gets to the point where I simply can't be bothered to repeat myself yet again. And why 'Bob' gets heard as 'Paul' pretty much all the time is totally beyond me. 
Most Americans can't tell the difference between English, Australian, NZ, and S African accents. It doesn't bother me, just find it mildly amusing. 
I think his ease of settling in will very much depend on where he's from, and where you will be living.  While the locals hereabouts are friendly enough and willing to chat, making true friendships hasn't been easy. I thought that would get easier through my kids when they started school, but not so. Working from home with a team geographically dispersed doesn't help on that score either. 
Tell him the tolerance UK police have for speeding is absolutely not demonstrated in the US! Still at least the place isn't littered with speed cameras. (In case there are any strident anti-speed folk reading this, I'd like to make clear I don't  speed in built up areas or where kids may be. I do think 70 on a wide open dry road miles from anywhere is fine, even if the sign and the cop disagreed). 
Get a bank account and credit card ASAP, start building a credit history. 
Remind him Cadbury's made by Hershey's isn't actually 'proper' at all. In a similar vein, bread in the US is too sweet - buy a bread machine, make your own. 
US TV is crap (no really, it is, you can admit it). Get a VPN service so iPlayer etc work. An iPad and a subscription to a UK newspaper app aids sanity too I find. 
Rejoice in the price of gas, get something that does less than 20 mpg. God knows you'd be unlikely to afford it in the UK, or be willing to put up with the crap dished out by weekend Eco-warriors. ;)
If he's  going to maintain any kind of financial life in the UK get an accountant that can take care of both UK and US taxes from the start.

The clause states that if a certain figure is offered, the club has to sell (dependent on the player agreeing to personal terms such as salary, etc with the club). And £85m would certainly trigger such a clause for just about any player in the world. As far as we know Gareth does not have one... 

So, basically, we don't have to sell him... However, if he wants to go he can be a bitch about it and try to force it through. Still, we can force him to stay... But that looks bad to future players. Also, he won't be worth as much next year, even if he has another great season, because of less time on his contract. So, it might be good business to sell now when RM is willing to pay an obscene amount of money for him.

There's a lot more to it than this... But that's basically it. Personally I would like to stand up to RM and this sort of transfer business, which I think is ruining the game.

Does not say anything more than 12th doctor, it does not say it's a drawing of the actual 12th doctor, it could be concept art. The title is vague enough not to state that it's using a drawing from the actual actor. Even opening it up, if you didn't know there was a confirmed 12th and the actor, it could be someone's fan drawing of who they want to be the 12th.

&gt;Re-watching the Smith episodes and I have a question: When does Amy get switched with the doppelganger?

Spoilers are for future episodes, people aren't required to hide every plot detail of past episodes. Read the spoiler policy on that one.

&gt;[12th Doctor spoilers] Doctor's reaction to his new face?

Does not confirm a 12th except for eventually. Its a post asking what people guess as to how the doctor will react to his regeneration. If this post was made 3 months ago it could be titled the same thing without people assuming Smith definitely leaving. 

&gt;Hey reddit, IYO where should I start? with the 12th doctor? 

Does not confirm a 12th except for eventually. Again, if this post was made before the news, it would be assumed this person is asking if they should wait until Smiths run is over.

&gt;Question: With John Hurt in the mix....wouldn't the 12th...be the 13th Regeneration?

This question has been asked in a number of ways ever since the finale, before the 12th was announced. 

edit - you say it's inconsistant but the mods are trying not to delete every reference to the 12th. You aren't seeing all the ones deleted, the ones that say ""Now that the veil is lifted on Twelve, post your best -and worst! - fan theories"" or ""Just realized that Capaldi will be the oldest actor to ever take the role of The Doctor""

There is a ferry which takes like 30-45 minutes (very lovely boat as well). After you get there you have a whole option of things to do. You can go hiking, drinking, or (what I did) just take the bus. For 1 pound 40 you get a ride all around the entire island.

This is one of the things I dislike about Reddit. Most people don't know the difference between a ""Spoiler"" and ""News"" and a ""Promo""

The BBC and Moffat don't do things just willy nilly.
There are secrets they keep, and information they release. 
They choose to do it as a process.
They do it to tailor the Doctor Who experience.

And not just them.  Any good dramatic franchise carefully examines how much information to ""tease"" and what information should not be ""spoiled""

You may think of this as a ""spoiler"" but the creators of the show INTEND for EVERY viewer to follow the progress of an experience.

I don't always like it either, but I have faith that if it is truly a franchise that I like, that means I like it for a reason and should trust those making the big decisions.

For example, Sons of Anarchy have already released 2 ""trailers"" for season 6. However, these are ""teasers"" with nothing specifically ""Season 6"" about them.  Just promos showing off their cast.  With their season starting in a month, Some information about what to look forward to would be nice for some of the fans, but I appreciate the secrecy and the thought involved in making the decision NOT to have a trailer with footage from the season.

A real ""Spoiler"" is the leak of vital story information, Things that are key to the plot.
While a ""Teaser"" is used to highlight the characters and setting in a promotional way, but not too revealing about key plot points.
Good show runners try their best to be very, very careful to craft their marketing to the latter.

Hell, most of the discussion I've seen is about what kind of costume the guy would wear....still not even a real discussion about the Plot.

We know the guy's FACE. That's it. If it were a novel, you'd find that out in the first 2 paragraphs. (if not the cover) There is no story here.  No meat and potatoes.  It is a face.  We still have the 50th to go before we can even realistically speculate ANYTHING about ANY story that this person might be a part of.  

The real thing I'm asking is that if you trust the showrunners (and I know a lot of you hate Moffat, so bear with me) Trust that they chose this person, not exactly based on the role, but based on **their ability to differentiate this role from others in their career, and from other actors who have played this part**.

If you have any faith that this individual is at least a mediocre actor, then trust that this information has not changed the fact that you have **no clue** how this role will be portrayed.

And for all of you who say that you would have rather *not known*.... I know that most of the Doctor Who fans I've seen on here would be horrifically traumatized if they ever just randomly regenerated The Doctor with no way of knowing it was coming.

I appreciate the BBC and cast and crew for giving us a chance to say a proper goodbye, and prepare for a very emotional experience.",0,1375682268,null,0,1375683242,0,cbh6e58,t3_1joyv7,t1_cbh6e58,t3_1joyv7,null,1429941841,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"After the takeover in 2008/09, Sturridge was *slightly* marginalised. I can't find a lot of data to back this up but as far as league games go he only racked up 450 minutes.**(28 mins per game)** Now that acceptable as a 19 year old but when the new owners picked up Robinho literally the second they took over and then went on to link themselves with the biggest strikers around the world he obviously got spooked. For perspective sake he managed to dis-place 19m Jo who joined that same summer.

His departure was a bit on the cards already he was in the last 11 months of his contract (when the takeover happened) already so it's fairly possible Chelsea had his ear from January itself. His club were saying they wanted bigger better strikers and another was saying they wanted him it's hardly surprising how that turned out. He was due a new contract either way and his stock was fairly high, he just won the Club Young player award for City and was easily their best youngster.

Of course the next season at Chelsea he played a whopping 300 minutes of league footy in 13 games **(23 mins per game)**. His next season was a massive improvement, 1100 minutes in 25 games **(44 mins per game)**. His third season at Chelsea was his best, AVB gave him a lot more game time, 2250 minutes in 30 games **(75 mins per game)**. His last season never really picked any momentum and with Lukaku tearing it up with West Brom he was always going to be expendable.

I think a good comparison can be made with John Guideti, that kid is really hyped up, he's had stellar loans seasons and has been on City's books for 3 whole years now and despite that he's barely figured for the first team.

Absolutely! Can't wait for our first victory vs. Arsenal, Chelsea and United etc under Rodgers. Long overdue and fully deserved. We should've won almost all of those matches last season so we're definitely capable.

&gt;we're getting close to the depth

At the risk of sounding contradictory to my above point, I think the word close is key here. I agree with your earlier point, most definitely: we **can** beat anyone on our day. However, squad-wise, we're certainly not there yet. Getting closer, but not quite. But what I've seen from our youngsters and new signings over the past few months (going back to the end of last season) is very, *very* promising.

Hopefully the vital experience Rodgers gave to our youngsters last season will translate into improved consistency this campaign.

People don't get their grades till the 15th of August and the first universities start on the 30th of September.  So you only get 6 weeks and in that time you need to:

 *  decide where to apply and what course you want to study












 * write a personal statement (which needs to be focused on where you are applying and what to do)














 * get that checked and sent in (currently this is done by teachers in schools, but they will all be closed so I don't know how this will be handled)

















 * unis have to read all this, decide who to interview and call people to interview (somehow without different unis calling the same people on the same days)













 * then make final decisions on who to take (when I was at uni this included reviewing who was admitting who both in the subject level AND at the wider school and uni level since we have diversity quotas to fill)













 * students have to decide where they want to go which they can't do until they are made offers, even if those offers are not conditional














 * people not made an offer need to go into clearing (or whatever round two will be called)













 * people made offers now have to sort out their accommodation and get their student loans sorted.








And all of this is in the ""silly season"" when everyone goes on holiday and it is being run by the most incompetent bureaucracies the nation has ever had (SLC can't get a loan sorted in 12 months let alone 12 days and the number of flops by exam boards seems to outstrip the number of actual exams somehow without having to hurry or get it right first time...).


Now maybe some of this could be alleviated by doing away with interviews (which really reduces peoples insight into the places and uni's insights into the students themselves) or cutting the number of places people can apply to (which reduces choice and means more people will end up in round 2).  Or maybe we could start uni later (so people get less educated) or finish A-levels sooner (ditto).

But all of that seems like a high price to pay simply for a little more certainty.  And certainty of what exactly?  The result is just as certain as before (X places - Y student = Z unlucky applicants), it's just a different distribution we are getting.

I doubt that a system with a little more information but only 30 work days will produce a fairer outcome than one with less *information* but more *consideration*.

In every country helmets have been made mandatory the cycling numbers have dropped. Which in turn has a much bigger impact on peoples health and society as a whole.

overnight cycling goes from being a healthy activity everyone can partake in to an activity that requires safety gear...mums and dads stop their kids cycling too. 

For starters - it resulted in a 30% drop, which led to cyclists being a less common sight on the roads, which lead to deaths of cyclists staying around the same number as before the 30% drop.

In addition to this - it increases car use, and discourages a healthy form of transport which alone extends life (heart disease/diabetes a non issue for most cyclists). 


There is an argument that car drivers would benefit more from a helmet than cyclists.

What do you expect them to do? Rent storage? ( not an option ) Drive to the tip? ( not an option ) Leave it all behind and just go? 

2. This is forcing people to move to designated areas that have worse housing and job prospects.

3. It's not a choice if you can't afford the extra room on the pittance you get from the state. You're eventually going to be evicted if you try and put up a fight. 

4. This is not just about London, it's countrywide. 

5. People often fight hard for social housing, they'll have been on a list for years, some have previously lived in shitty B&amp;B's full of drug addicts, alcoholics and problematic people or have themselves been homeless before they got their housing. The day they finally moved in was probably one of the best days of their lives, now the government have decided it wants them to go through all of this again just because they say so when it's partly the governments fault for selling off and not replacing social housing in the first place. 

6. It's splitting up communities and often families.  

Disclaimer: I own my own central London flat, I'm one of the lucky ones. I am however more intelligent than to believe this divide and rule bullshit praying on those on the lowest rung of the ladder. I believe that some level of socialism is a good thing, I don't mind contributing at all and I'd rather pay for that than pay to line the pockets of the already rich as seems to be happening in this country right now. 

But... I have compassion and can empathise with those who are having a shit time right now from this ( and there are many ) because I've also been through this system and believe me, it's a shitty place to be regardless of location.

The remission system is fairly complicated for those not on a qualifying benefit, you are going to have to get claimants to bring in banks statements and proofs of earnings and outgoings. Not a huge problem when you've got years to issue a claim in the other civil courts but it's going to be a pain in the arse with the three month deadline for employment tribunal, especially as people never seek advice on the day of dismissal or whatever but usually wait a few weeks. Or two months and 25 days.
The remission system will have to change when Universal Credit is rolled out across the country, everyone expects that the government will use this to tighten up remission and add things like capital tests. Not necessarily a bad thing in themselves but could punish people who have been ""made redundant"" and really want to claim an unfair dismissal (they might exempt redundancy payments from the test - that would be sensible).

*The 12th Doctor... by Adam Law

Aug. 4th - Doctor Who Announcement Special Thread [SPOILERS]

So I was at Doctor Who Live and stuck around for a very special autograph from a new cast member...

As we wait for tonight's announcement, remember this comment. We're about to enter stage 2.

Anybody else have complete faith in the people casting the Doctor?

What do you think 12's style will be like?

Madcap theory time: How would you feel if... [12th Doctor spoilers ahead]*

The last one gives the news away completely and it hasn't yet been deleted, but even without it, it would be a very different task to not connect the dots. There is an unusual amount of very specific talk about the 12th Doctor. There is also mention of ""a new cast member"", an announcement so big that it justifies a countdown and a special thread talk about ""the people casting the Doctor"".

I don't want to appear as a hater or anything, but I think OP has a point. I highly doubt that it's possible to avoid this news. The identity of new Doctor, yes. But not that there will be a new one.

That being said, the rules we have there are: ""If the title is vague enough that it does not state it as fact that there is a new doctor or smith is leaving, then just leave the post up because it's annoying as shit to all of you to delete everything"" That's my unofficial summary :)

We got three ways to go basically:

1. Let spoilers in titles which gives away HUGE spoilers for people trying to avoid them.

2. ban any possible title that could possibly be a spoiler, just in case. 

3. Somewhere in the middle. 

Yes people are going to figure it out, but #3 gives them a chance at least. Having posts flat out say ""SMITH IS LEAVING!!"" is no chance. Doing it this way, we aren't just changing rules whenever, by whatever we feel like. We set it as, if the title is vague enough that it isn't a fact of this casting, let's just let them stay up.

Having it be one of the first two choice will severely pissed off the people that want the other choice.

true,rougecathy,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire (in exile in Surrey),"I am someone who works advising and representing claimants so I hopefully know a bit more about this than some. I've already launched a bit of a rant on ""success"" rates and how many claims are ""frivolous"", I hope that you accept that not a huge amount are (and understand that I accept that some are, and some of those frivolous claims are ones that are settled by commercially-minded employers). One of the less trumpeted changes to come in was a paper sift at the beginning of the process which will weed out weak claims (and possibly decent claims that have been badly expressed by claimants representing themselves). The question ""do you have £1200 knocking about?"" is not the same as ""do you have a strong claim?""

I'm not sure I have a problem with an issuing fee at tribunal in theory. There is a fee in the Small Claims Court and that works fairly well. But if you win at the small claims court that you will get the cost of your fees (and other costs) added to your winnings. There is no guarantee that this will happen with the tribunal fees. Tribunals certainly do have the power to order losing respondents to pay the winning claimant's costs, and this is separate from the rest of the costs regime where you have to show unreasonable behaviour on the respondent's part (you would have to get a very naughty respondent to gets costs against them). This means that for a low value claim you might end up losing financially even if you win. I have been told that judges have been told not to add fees to awards as a matter of default, but we will have to see what happens in practise. If the reality is fees generally are awarded then you get the opposite problem - an employer who does something wrong that doesn't have a great deal of financial impact might end up paying a disproportionate amount. What happens to the fees that have been remitted for a low-income claimant if that claimant wins? I haven't seen anything that suggests a power to order the respondent reimburse the state (although that wouldn't really be my problem, so I've not looked very hard).

Even if you win and the tribunal does award you the fees, then the employer might not pay. In 2009 39% of Employment Tribunal claims were unpaid http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/19/05/2010/55622/fast-track-employment-tribunal-scheme.htm , I don't have up-to-date figures, hopefully they will be lower as it was made easier to enforce the award in the ""normal"" courts"", but non-payment is still a problem.

I also expect what will happen is that employers will be less willing to settle until the hearing fee is paid - why settle early when the claimant might not go all the way because they can't afford it? This will have claims dragging round in the system for longer than they would otherwise. All the time a claim is in the system the tribunals are case managing it, issuing orders, dealing with correspondence, looking to list it.

The remission regime also means that if you are on benefits there is not much incentive to get a job until both the fees are out of the way. If you are claiming loss of earnings then you have a duty to ""mitigate your loss"" (i.e. look for work) but you wouldn't want to look too hard until the hearing fee has been remitted. 

Unison are having the fees Judicially Reviewed in October. Alongside access to justice issues, they are also claiming that the fees are indirectly discrimination as fewer women than men will have their fees remitted as (I'm very much paraphrasing) they are more likely to have a well earning partner - i.e. a man. I do thin this is true, although the Judicial Review might find the fees proportionate. It is certainly true that two-earner households will face more of a barrier to justice than one-earner households who will probably be on a qualifying benefit to remit. 

TL:DR I hope that Unison are successful. While an issuing fee is not necessarily a terrible idea, this particular implementation is.",0,1375696220,null,0,false,0,cbh8t93,t3_1jojvn,t1_cbh8t93,t3_1jojvn,null,1429940648,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Me too, but I'm relatively lucky in that there is a painted cycle lane almost all the length of my commute.  Of course the cars don't respect it all of the time, but it's better than nothing.  My biggest gripe is cars parking in it (when there is a yellow line making that illegal), so I'm constantly having to pull out into the heavier traffic.

&gt; One big time where I risk it anyway is right turns, where if you're not in the middle of the lane you are never going to get a motorist to give way to you.

You do mean ""middle of the road"" not ""middle of the lane"" here don't you?  You should be in the right of the lane, and middle of the road, when waiting to turn right, of course!   If you mean it as you wrote it then it's no wonder you're having safety problems!

true,Kyospher,flair5,,"I have always been a big fan of Ligue 1 and listen to Bixente Lizarazu's radio show every week for 3 years now. As the captain of Les Bleus, he is the player we hear from the most, even if it goes against his personality.

People were slagging him for joining us; saying we are not a big enough club than Lyon for him to jump ship; Bixente pointed to Valdes being shaky. Hugo treated us with a lot of respect even before coming, he educated the French public about our history and value while still at Lyon.  He said we were a huge club Aulas needed to sell immediately for maximum profit. 

The press was very vindictive after he got sat on the bench; they mentioned Mandanda to Deschamps every chance they got; the asshole happily bit and slagged off Spurs and said he would bench Hugo. I am a bit skeptical of AVB on this as well because Hugo was only made first choice after he said he'd leave in January if this kept going.

In my opinion, that saga crushed him; you guys have not seen the French captain in action at full force yet. Way before his link to Tottenham I always referred to him as Saint Lloris, and I cannot do it anymore unfortunately. I have watched him for at least 4 years and for us he has had a lot more trouble than he should. Same went for Gomes as well... It's either the EPL or Tottenham defenders being always injured etc...

Back on AVB, I think benching Ade was similarly devastating; but I would back him in both decisions.

My big worry as of now is that Hugo is not on a path to renew his contract after it is up; 1000 years in the future I hope Levy made sure. That should change though.

We have a claim to the best keeper in the EPL. Chavette Cech may dispute that because Hugo has been consistently out of form. Out side of the EPL; I'd only take Gigi, Iker and Neuer ahead of LLoris.

true,SerPuissance,cnty-wales,Clarks pie innit,"Not that I don't believe you but I'd be interested to read your sources. But basically what that boils down to is that people put their hair above their saftey. Those numbers aren't a result of helmets being bad, it's a result of people being ridiculous about wearing them. That doesn't mean they can be dismissed - death and injury reduction is the primary goal and if not making helmets mandatory does a better job then who am I to argue. But christ that's daft. If I may point out the absurdity of a few of those statistics:

&gt;overnight cycling goes from being a healthy activity everyone can partake in to an activity that requires safety gear...mums and dads stop their kids cycling too.

Because suddenly people are told that cycling is potentially dangerous people stop doing it, whereas before helmets it was even more dangerous. That's stupid.

&gt;For starters - it resulted in a 30% drop, which led to cyclists being a less common sight on the roads, which lead to deaths of cyclists staying around the same number as before the 30% drop.

So helmets are that big an inconvenience that people give up on cycling in droves because helmets mess up their hair and don't look cool. Also stupid.

 &gt;In addition to this - it increases car use, and discourages a healthy form of transport which alone extends life (heart disease/diabetes a non issue for most cyclists).

Again because people don't like them, not because cycling becomes more dangerous or less atrractive as a form of transport. 

&gt;There is an argument that car drivers would benefit more from a helmet than cyclists.

I think both would benefit equally if people valued their brains over their hair spray.

If those number are true, then clearly mandatory helmets is not a good strategy to reduce cycling incidents. But it's not because helmets don't work or it makes cycling more dangerous, it's because people are lazy and stupid. 

When I cycle I wear a helmet, and I have the childhood stitches to show people why it isn't smart not to.

Just do a search for ""helmet compulsion uk"" maybe add ""Australia"" to that search too. Its a pretty will documented effect, and will be explain it better than me.

There is also a good Ted talk on the subject - its a little OTT (very bike centric), but brings up some valid points.

Its the primary reason why it always gets thrown out when governments suggest it. All (well, most) statistics show that the benefits of cycling out weigh the dangers and compulsion discourages cycling, and is shown to discourage cycling in other countries.

&gt;So helmets are that big an inconvenience that people give up on cycling in droves because helmets mess up their hair and don't look cool. Also stupid.

Not about hair (well...Im sure it is for some) - its to do with perception. Before popping down the local shop did not require safety gear to do so, and now every grandmother, child need special gear to use a public space. It was never dangerous before but it is now....better stop doing it then.

It also removes the responsibility of others. How many articles have you read when a cyclist is crushed by a hgv and it mentions helmet...As if helmets stop body/head trauma when being run down.




&gt;But it's not because helmets don't work or it makes cycling more dangerous, it's because people are lazy and stupid.

I disagree. I don't know any cyclists who are lazy for starters, as for stupid...Maybe, but discouragement is discouragement. 

Also, its safe not to overstate the safety of helmets - they are not the equal of motorbike helmets of seatbelts. They are tested to work on light collisions only (12mph I think)

&gt;But it's not because helmets don't work or it makes cycling more dangerous, it's because people are lazy and stupid.

again, there is definitely an element of truth to that. But society is more complex than that.


Personally I always wear one. I'm not advocating every one throw theirs away, and I encourage everyone to use one. But at the same time....I appreciate the benefits of cycling over being to scared to cycle - stupid or not more cyclists on the road is better for everyone

That's the one criticism I have for Lloris. I think he is the best keeper I have ever seen at the club and amongst the top two or three in the league.

I also think his leadership and skill means that he will fill the void left by Ledley King as a calming presence in defense. Everyone knows Lloris will play the sweeper role and everyone knows he will come out and claim crosses.

John Crace wrote a very good column about Hugo a few weeks ago. His point is that we are short on backup, I don't agree with that (Brad is fine) but his points on Lloris are dead on. What a player.

Making people admit to themselves that it is potentially hazardous, and making them look silly are strong forms of discouragement none the less.

I have been hit by a car in another much much quieter ""cycle friendly city"" but it was minor and a helmet wouldn't have made any difference.

true,SerPuissance,cnty-wales,Clarks pie innit,"&gt; Why do you care? It doesn't effect you. If you want to cycle with a helmet then go for it but I don't see what problem I am causing by not doing so.

I care because I don't like seeing people get hurt if it's preventable. Yes I may get run over by a bus and crushed to death on my bike - but I may also get knocked off my bike less seriously and hit the road or pavement. In the latter case, I'd like to minimise my chances of concussion, haemorrhage or skull fractures. That's all. 

Why do I care whether people wear helmets when I'm driving? Well it's quite simple - again it's the case of the kocking someone off or whitnessing it happening. I hope it will never happen, but imagine how I would feel if that person died as a result of their head injuries. Imagine living with that every day, and probably doing time for it, all the while knowing that it if the cyclist had been wearing a helmet maybe they would have got off with a concussion but avoided serious cranial injury. A friend of mine is a paramedic in spain, and last year he attended an incident where the cyclist had been knocked off and the kerb had opened up their skull - the brain was visible.  It was right on the top of his head, where a helmet would have saved him. Just a regular office guy on his way to work who got clipped by a car door that was being opened on the sid eof the road. Now this is just me, but I'm not too keen on chancing such a thing myself.

If is up to each individual to decide what they are going to do in order to minimise the probability of sustaining a serious injury. When I cycle, my own level of saftey comfort is to make use of cycleways, wear a helmet and hi-vis gear in low light conditions. That's just me, but I can't help but feel that if everyone was ok with taking the same level of responsility we'd have fewer cycling accindents and deaths. It'd be nice if people would think about what consequences would befall other people in the case of them having an accident - it affects more than just the victim when it's serious. Sounds to me like you just wouldn't like the idea of being told what to do. God knows we put up with alot of that. I'm sure people felt the same after the introduction of the seatbelt law but now it's second nature for most people.

Also, I had been driving for over 5 years without a single bump or run in. Until it happened. Just something to think about.

The fact he says later on that trying to turn right 'people don't let him out' indicates he might not have had training on how you safely perform a right turn on a bicycle.

I'm not trying to fling mud, really, I just think sometimes a bit of reflection can help.

Honestly I lean more to the side that it _is_ better to be on the dole than doing work that is ""bad"" for society - but since there is no way to judge good and bad objectively (some guy might hate that all the small shops are closed, another guy loves he can go to tesco at 4am and buy junk food), how do you even deal with that?

It gets under the skin of a whole social debate about what work is, why and whether it is ""inherently"" valuable and to be encouraged and so on.

If ""lap dancing"" is to be optional because it's degrading that opens a very wide door to the criticism of mandatory work in and of itself.

continued to be successful this year and that our strategy of being the Consumers’ Champion continues to reap rewards.

&gt;“Our colleagues have worked hard throughout the year and, as a result, we have exceeded the second underlying EBITDA target of £250m set under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme and the stretch target of £270m.

&gt;""This means the Group has successfully met the first two targets while there remain two more years to go under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme.

&gt;“There is no doubt that the Group’s record-breaking results were in the large part down to our colleagues and their hard work. The Employee Bonus Share Schemes have continued to drive this performance and we are pleased that eligible employees will be rewarded in August as the second and final part of the 2009 Employee Bonus Share Scheme vests.

So Sports Direct hires all these zero hour workers, awards full time staff - managers - a small slice of the **record** profits, not people on the [shop floor](http://www.youthfightforjobs.com/wordpress/wordpress/?p=761) and gets away with spinning itself as a model employer in the UK.",0,1375705364,null,0,false,0,cbha4s5,t3_1jq4m9,t1_cbha4s5,t1_cbh9adl,null,1429940033,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; HND in IT worth it or do they look for full degrees?

Some companies may discriminate but not in my experience - provided you can show you've mastered the skills involved. The trick will be to have some kind of portfolio of work that displays that you're technically capable of the roles you're applying for. 

A full degree would be better - in all honesty - as it is ""full"". *However* I appreciate the costs involved there so you might prefer to do a bit more research before choosing this option! 

&gt; What can I expect to earn and job can I expect to get with a HND?

Graduate salaries vary depending on location, type of role etc. but a typical graduate Java / C# developer might expect between about £16,000 and £24,000 outside of London. This escalates inside London due to the costs of living involved. Competition for graduate roles with larger companies (BT, for example) are stiff but they pay a lot more money for those who are successful. Someone I know from last years crop of Uni of Birmingham students went to BT with a salary in excess of £30,000 I believe. 

As for the type - that's down to you. Web based roles (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.) generally pay a bit less, Java is popular with academics as it's free to use (so to speak) so a lot of Universities tend to focus in that direction. Java and C# are equally sought after in the UK currently and there's a skills shortage there. 

There are other more multimedia roles which might see you using Adobe graphics suites or Flash but they're probably not the best to go for and Flash is a dying 'art'. PHP is quite popular at the moment as well...

true,coppafeel,flair5,,"What do you think of AVB's transition from Friedel to Lloris?
I personally thought AVB handled the situation really well. By taking his time to introduce Lloris he get a look at the English style of play and could see how he would have to change his game when you compare what happened with David De Gea at Utd (didn't play very well but eventually got his bearings). I feel for Friedel but like OP said he fits so much better into the system despite Friedels vast experience. 

Do you think Lloris will become unsettled if Bale leaves and/or spurs don't land CL football?
I don't think so. He's such a loyal player. He's only been with two clubs an I think he gets on with everyone and especially AVB (clearly sharing grooming techniques)

How do you rank Lloris in comparison to other keepers in the EPL?
I think he is classed as one of the best keepers in the EPL. He's been regarded as a top keeper in Europe for some time and having a stronger defence in front of him will no spit better opinions on him. 

Expectations of the player for 2013?
A good solid season just like this season but I would really like to see a Spurs goalkeeper grind out a 1-0 or 0-0 result when we've been battered by the other team as I haven't seen that for a long long time but with Lloris I can see that happening",0,1375705887,null,0,false,0,cbha8bj,t3_1jqcdw,t1_cbha8bj,t3_1jqcdw,null,1429939986,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,listyraesder,null,null,"There can be, as you state, more than one royal standard! The Union Flag is the standard that represents the union of the crowns.

The Union Flag dates back to 1606 as a personal standard for James I. Until 1707, the union of the kingdoms was a personal one - political union, the creation of ""Great Britain"" as a sovereign nation, came only in that year. Only then did the flag become standardised (before, there had been a Scottish variant and an English variant) by Queen Anne, yet it still remained a personal standard.

It's not until the 20th century that we have any record of the Union Flag being conceived of for civic purposes, and it was 1933 before a serving government representative claimed the flag for the United Kingdom. But still (as with most things in Britain) it was left as a matter of precedence and tradition - to this day there is no order, rule or specification with the weight of law conferring official national flag status on the Union Flag. It remains very much one of the personal flags of the Monarch.

I'd recommend Nick Groom's wonderful biography of the Union Flag for a fascinating read.

If I was a player in his position, i.e. I think I could be a decent signing for a top half prem team, I probably also wouldn't jump to the first team that had an offer accepted for me.

Obviously this is all speculation by me as to what his attitude is actually like, he could actually be a giant dick.

I am single and live alone in a 2 bedroom flat, that I moved into 8 years ago whilst still working. The area is a dump, but it is cheap to rent, and I was trying to get back on my feet after a brutal divorce.

I have PPMS, and lost my job a few years ago largely because I could no longer carry it out. I'm on the third floor, with no lift, and cannot manage the stairs anymore - the last time I left my flat a couple of months ago I had to shuffle down (and later up) the stairs on my backside like a toddler. Fortunately I can budget, and have no ""luxury"" expenses other than the internet (no TV, £10 a month phone, havent used heating for 3 years, cancelled insurance policies, etc), and still the only reason I can pay the extra cost of a spare room is because I receive DLA (rent went from £3 a week to £16.20 a week, trivial amounts I know, but still a lot when your income is limited).

I agree with the motive behind the bedroom tax, but think it has been implemented terribly. Would it not have been better in the long run to have introduced incentives for the building of 1 bedroom properties, with the intention of introducing the bedroom tax in a few years, thereby giving time for the housing stock to be adjusted to requirements, rather than immediately forcing added expenses on those who are unable to more because suitable property isn't available.

I have been able to save £20 a month for the last year, and am hoping it will be enough to afford the expenses of moving when a ground floor 1 bed property becomes available. The only reason I can afford this is because I have MS.

History gives Liverpool our passion and our commitment, it's the reason players like Gary fucking Neville hold a begrudging respect of this club. History dictates how we support the club and the exact nature of the club; we must poor our entirety into the act because it's *Liverpool*. I'll always remember what Rafa said at the half of the 2005 CL final - ""We are Liverpool. You are playing for Liverpool. Don't forget that."" And the beauty of that statement lies in the fact that it *means*  something, that every player in that room could hear the faithful thousands singing YNWA and knew exactly how special this club is.

I fear if Liverpool is bought by another oil tycoon we'll just turn into another plastic club. Forget Rodgers and the project, why don't we just hire the flavor of the month manager?

true,amongthewolves,lfc99,,"Firstly, we really can't speculate as to why Suarez wasn't at the dinner with the team. A lot of people are going to say it's because he wants to distance himself away from the team, but we don't know the full story. Considering the huge animosity he gets from the English press, it could be that he just wanted to avoid putting his family through that the entire night. He did state one of his reasons for leaving was because of his treatment of the English media, and here we are talking about why he didn't show up at a dinner. Every move he makes(or doesn't make) is being highly criticized and it's absolutely absurd! He's an LFC player still and we shouldn't be making accusations unless his departure is absolutely certain.

Secondly, I had read somewhere that he doesn't want to hand in a transfer request only because of the loyalty bonus that is attached to his contract. I don't want to see Suarez go, but he deserves to be playing in Champions League and competing for all honors this season. I do agree with everyone that he should stay for one more season and if we don't accomplish a top four finish, then he has the right to speak with other clubs. I for one would welcome him signing for teams such as your Real Madrids and Barcas. I just don't want him on another team that's fighting for a top 4 finish in the league as well!

Lastly, I think we have built up quite a bit of depth since last season. Even with just the inclusion of Sturridge and Coutinho, we have managed some magnificent goals with or without Suarez. Since his ban, we have looked at other members of the team to step up and we've seen that we can score goals without him. I'll admit that we wouldn't be scoring as much without him! Costa is definitely the same breed as Suarez; he's definitely a tenacious player, technically gifted, tricky, physical, and he fights to win at all costs. However, no one can replace the magic that is Suarez. He's an absolute gamechanger and completely unpredictable upfront, and we need that right now.

Phew, that was a long post.

TL;DR: We need to stop criticizing Suarez' every move until we actually see him wearing another team's jersey. He needs to stick with us this season and move on if we don't get top 4. No one can replace Suarez, but we'll be okay if he decides to leave this summer.",0,1375707639,null,0,false,0,cbhal0h,t3_1jqgqz,t1_cbhal0h,t1_cbha63k,null,1429939823,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

I was in employment for a continuous 1.5 years, then I was told there's nothing I did wrong but,
they have to release me. And yes, you cannot claim unfair dismissal on a zero-hour contract. Awesome.
I am getting to realize that even legal immigrants mostly can only get jobs with close to zero rights,
close to zero trust, and close to zero respect.
And then people are surprised that many of us just start milking the social system.
It's strange because it's only super easy to claim social benefits,
on the other hand the Jobcentre is a joke.
It's not that they should make me sit at home waiting for the call: Good morning dear sir, here's your new job.
What I am saying is on these biweekly appointments they have no clue what is (and should be) going on with you,
and most of their job postings are mirrored from job search websites,
so basically they're using taxpayer money to fund me, and advertise private sites on the internet those most people already aware of.
Also their online Jobmatch system is broken, so you cannot even apply for many of their own postings, there is no apply button,
but you can choose why you didn't apply. lol.
I am not expecting the Jobcentre (nor the Spanish Inquisition ;) to do my job finding a new job, but it's like they are not even trying,
and many unemployed people would think, why would they then?
So it's not easy, even when you have a BSc diploma which would represent some quality studies by European standards,
and then even after you get it through a comparability test with UKNARIC for some money to have a paper saying: yes, it's comparable to a British BSc diploma (lol),
then finally you are being told you might get an Engineering job but only if you hold a British passport.

It annoys people because income isn't being assessed as a family, so the stay at

Many families give up the second income as a sacrifice, a very painful one because they want to give their children a better start. Minimum wage strangers looking after a room full of children is not as good, it physically can't be. In this case HMG is punishing them.

Even stay at home children often go to nursery a bit, or certainly pre-school as they get older. The single earner's tax rebate will be capped and so smaller than the couple.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"It seems like a lot of people on reddit are failing to grasp the argument. I NEVER said it was or should be legal to threaten people and I never said freedom of speech covered threats. My argument is about how to deal with.

The problem is primarily a technical one. People can , with about 5 minutes of googling find out how to keep their identity private through anonymous proxies, public wifi and vpns.  This is why there are so many threats but so few arrests.  I would hazzard a guess that the police are aware of the problem of proxies vpns and public wifis being used by trolls to hide their identity. You see the police face a dilemma - they can either trace peoples IP addresses ( by going to twitter asking for id addresses and then matching that with  logs from the internet  service provider ie BT , Virgin, Sky talk talk etc ). There are two problems with this. One is that some of the trolls probably live abroad so involve a lengthy cross jurisdictional legal case, the other is that the trolls will eventually figure it out and move to proxies and vpns etc to hide their identity. The other option is to let people be dicks on the internet and only arrest the people that are actually pretty scary ( people that are very abusive or people, once their identity is check by the police actually have a record of violence. )  If you choose to block all overseas connections all known vpn connections and all proxy connections and all known public wifi then you will also exclude people like the revolutionaries  in the arab spring along with other legitimate people.  That's kind of the choice from a technical side. Also proxies change all the time so playing whack-a-mole with proxies is very difficult. Stopping trolls from  setting up another account is very difficult.  Stopping them technically is very difficult to achieve no matter how smart the people they are trolling are.  

So if stopping them with technical measures is difficult what other options are there? Well you can arrest all you can but you'll never get them all and you can't imprison them indefinitely. That leaves the option on working on their motivation. Their motivation is to make people freak out and react.  If you just block them again and again they will look for trolling victims someplace else. 


**TL;DR** it is technically very difficult to either stop or arrest all troll so it may be best to deal with their motivation by NOT giving them the reward they want (which is to get a reaction). It is not a case of what SHOULD be done it is a case of what CAN be done.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"Really not that much. 

As a patient, I have to get regular bone marrow aspirations, where they stick a needle through my hip bone and suck out some marrow. It sounds terrible - but you are all numbed up so you can feel pushing and twisting to get the needle in, there really is not much pain. The area is a bit bruised and tender for a couple of days, but that's it. 

But for a donor it is often much simpler. The most widely used method of donating bone marrow is known as a peripheral blood stem cell donation (PBSC). You will have to visit the hospital or clinic for four days in a row to receive injections which stimulate the production of stem cells. On the fifth day you will be connected to a cell-separator machine without the need for a general anaesthetic. The machine usually collects the stem cells from your blood through a vein in one arm, returning the blood to your body through a vein in your other arm. This takes about 4-5 hours and may need to be repeated on the next day. You don't need to have the bone puncture like I do, you just have a needle in each arm. Simple and basically painless. A bit boring for those 4-5 hours, but it's not much of a chore to save a life.

The other way, though less common, to harvest requires a two-night stay in hospital and under general anaesthetic. The cells are extracted from the pelvic bones by sterile needle and syringe - very similar to my marrow aspirations, but they'll remove more marrow and because of this the general anaesthetic is needed. No surgical incision is required and the stem cells replace themselves within 21 days so you don't lose anything by doing this.

I have never donated bone marrow (nobody would want mine!) - but I might need to receive it one day and already have my donor lined up, if I do. So for the sake of others, please sign up!

He was complying with police instructions to leave Royal Exchange Buildings. He posed no threat”. Today, I apologise unreservedly for Simon Harwood’s use of excessive and unlawful force, which caused Mr Tomlinson’s death, and for the suffering and distress caused to his family as a result.

So if Tomlinson was ""unlawfully killed"" by Simon Harwood, then why the hell wasn't Harwood convicted of manslaughter- at the very least.

&gt;The Commissioner further apologises for the information given by a Metropolitan police officer to Dr Shorrock and Dr Swift that misled them initially as to the cause of death. **Whilst we are satisfied that the officer’s actions were inadvertent, and not designed to mislead the pathologists,** this should not have happened and I apologise to the family for the additional distress it caused them.

Lots of people were talking about [Idris Elba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Elba), and he's goddamn great. At 40, he's also right in the right age range, but I don't think he's the Doctor. It's too much against type for him at this point -- plus, he's become a bit too big and well known, which is traditionally a thing the new Doctor is NOT.

[Chiwetel Ejiofor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor) (36) is another name often mentioned -- both for this and for Bond -- but he's got the same ""successful international career"" issue that makes Elba less attractive. The oddsmakers still had him as the second most likely choice, at 7:1 after Ben Daniels.

[David Harewood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harewood), known mostly to Americans as _Homeland_'s David Estes, might've been a good pick. He's still older (a young-looking 47), but he's largely unknown in the US. Even so, though, he's pretty famous in the UK -- MBE and all that -- and one gets the notion they prefer to avoid well-known actors.

[Richard Ayoade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ayoade) (also 36) from _The IT Crowd_ has also been mentioned a bunch. I could see him working very well, and he's not too famous yet, but he'd have been a better hire after Tennant; right now, I see a lot of resonance between Maurice Moss and Matt Smith's Doctor, and if I were casting the role today that would make me want to look elsewhere. 

(He's not remotely nonwhite, but this sort of ""Smithiness"" is why I think [Ben Whishaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Whishaw) wouldn't have worked, either.)

Because of that, there aren't any other ways people can live vicariously through The Doctor who don't fit neatly into his looks. All twelve of them. Which I can understand. Not everyone can be Batman, but there are plenty of Batman-like superheroes they can be. But instead of wanting something drastic like changing The Doctor's race or gender, why not create your own? It's not that hard to make something up. Create The Doctor like how you'd want him and make a show/film/book/song/game/etc with your version. Changing a few things so that you're not sued by England, of course. Who knows, you might be super-successful. Competition is great so you'd make ""Doctor Who"" a better show. Or, big irony, you'll get asked to write/direct an episode.

And just because The Doctor could be a different race or gender... I find the whole thing rude. It'd be like going to your best friend and saying, ""Gee...

true,Annaeus,sontaran,Sontaran,"Someone posted an observation a few weeks ago that each regeneration is a reflection of what has happened to the previous regeneration. Tennant was a reflection of the 'softening' of Eccleston's doctor as a result of Rose's influence. Smith was a reflection of Tennant's feeling that he had 'lived too long', an attempt to cope with that sense of being too old. 

And after all the losses that Smith has suffered (the Ponds, the re-writing and un-re-writing of his past, facing his own death, accepting the loss of his wife, acknowledging the Hurt Doctor) and what I think is a maturing and darkening of Smith's persona, Capaldi may be a return to a more mature, stable personality, perhaps less emotionally vulnerable than Smith.

Personally I'm quite pleased at the difference in age between Smith and Capaldi - it pretty much forecloses the romantic interest between the Doctor and Clara. Rose and Eccleston; Rose and Tennant; Martha and Tennant; Amy and Smith (she did try to seduce him, after all); River and Smith; Clara and Smith. With the exception of Donna there's been a romantic storyline between the Doctor and every female companion. 

The Doctor has only just acknowledged the loss of his wife; the emotional disconnect between this and fancying Clara was just a little too jarring for me. I think it will be good to give the character some time to 'heal' and move on - and get back to the adventuring without the sexual tension that has occupied so much of the time since the series re-started.",0,1375712650,null,0,1375712832,0,cbhbuvl,t3_1jpn2o,t1_cbhbuvl,t3_1jpn2o,null,1429939156,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

true,ZeldenGM,eng-yorkshire,Graduate amongst ducks,"More hassle.

With a part time contract there are then set hours which I'm expected to attend to when more often or not I'd prefer to change my days around. The flexibility of my current contract allows me to work when I want, up to a certain number of hours unless they don't need me (which is unlikely because full time employees like to take holidays this time of year)

I'd also then have to terminate and resign a contract every-time I wanted to come back to work (I work during holidays from uni) which again is more hassle on both sides. 

On the company side of things they then have to factor in nonsense like sick-leave, holiday pay etc which is ridiculous given I don't really deserve these benefits as I'm not a year-round employee.

The current contract is mutually beneficial and flexible which works as an ideal with a decent level of communication. I'm also paid almost double minimum wage which I've not been able to find on any fixed part-time contracts.


This type of contract is ideal for employees like myself. I have plenty of student friends on similar contracts who have no problems whatsoever.

The only problem I could ever see arising with this is if I relied on a regular stable income to live. If this was the case it would be madness to even consider such a contract. I imagine those that are complaining fall well into this category.

Is it really so hard to believe that there can be good employer-employee relationships which work out in a flexible contract?

With that said, it actually took a few episodes for me to get into it starting with that series. The first episode starts pretty fast and i remember feeling like i missed something but that passes. I still recommend that you do so but if after a couple episodes you're not a huge fan, stick with it for a few more and you will be rewarded (what I did). Chris eccleston was good but pales in comparison to David tenant (the actor who replaces eccleston as the doctor after the first series) in my opinion. It is the second series on where things get amazing.

No. I worked on a zero hour contract and ended up doing ~35 hrs/wk on average. I was very happy with it. (I'm also a student). And that's exactly it. It only really works for students and people who don't have to work. 

If I was reliant on a zero hour contract, I would *have* to be available for work during the company's opening hours.

The problems arise when these zero hours contracts are misused, ie by firms that want a roughly set number of hours each week but don't want to make a proper commitment.

If the business is genuinely unpredictable (eg. ad-hoc staffing for irregular events such as in conference centres, hotel banqueting suites etc.) then it's perfectly reasonable to use these kinds of contracts and in all likelihood the types of people the employer will be intending to hire will be people with other jobs / students etc. 

From my own experience, the people on these contracts are on them with a few companies and pick up days here and there and are able to reliably get 30+ hours a week, or around their studies, albeit with no two weeks looking the same as the balance of work between employers varies.

I live in both Germany and the UK and I can safely say this: Water (nationalised in Germany) is considerably more expensive, as is gas and the state alternative for electricity.

The trains in Germany are partly state owned, partly privately owned and are generally the same price or more expensive than here. They do however have lots of different options for buying a ticket which makes it very cheap to travel in a group, providing you only use the slow trains. Buses are extortionate without a ""season ticket"".

Long story short: Price rises are not simply a product of privatisation. Competition forces prices down in almost all fields (even when bidding for a line, as per trains, as they have to meet certain criteria upon winning a contract).

Cars will often be of a similar price, cheaper in groups, due to the fact that you don't have to pay for wages and maintaining the line, stations and trains. Furthermore, for all intents and purposes trains and buses have fixed overheads which don't increase significantly with increased usage.

The government privatises to raise cash.  It's that simple.  Having run the country at a massive deficit for decades, successive governments from Thatcher onwards discovered that you could bolster the exchequer to the tune of billions and disguise the ever increasing debt burden by selling off public utilities and state owned organisations.  They we nothing more than quick, substantial injections of cash to balance the books and lower the level of borrowing required.

The problem the current government has, is that there is almost nothing left to sell.  All the power, water and telecoms utilities have gone.  Trains have gone (and let's not forget even British Airways was state owned in the past).  So now they're reduced to selling off things that no one in their right mind would really want to entrust to for-profit capitalism, such as the probation service and forensic crime investigation labs.

What's worse, is that because most of these aren't anywhere near as lucrative as the big national industries that were privatised before, they're being flogged off at a price that will barely even make a scratch on the government finances.

It's clear that was his agent's impression of the clause, based on what he's been telling other clubs like Arsenal. Players trust their agents, so Suarez believed this as well. Once it came out that there was really no release clause at all, I can see how Suarez felt lied to.

More teams could be looking at him because they'd need him or a late title challenge or to help round-out an attack. 

Next summer, if we are not in the Champions League, Suarez is gone. We've seen this with Gerrard in '05. In order to keep him, we had to win the fucking Champions League. Jesus H. Tapdancing Christ I don't think that we have the ability to do that. So we'll see what we can do, but I don't think Suarez will be a Liverpool player much longer. 

***

Diego Costa is not somebody we should be looking at in my opinion. £21m for what? Aspas is an individual who is better. He is cheap, topped the scoring charts in La Liga, and is very proficient. Besides, we now have a plethora of attacking options and we have to leave space for Yesil to grow. I don't want us to spend a large amount of money simply to spend money. Keeping our transfers low is something that I think is important. 


***

I don't think that we now have a chance at 4th. It's going to take a lot of injuries and inconsistencies from Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, City, or United to give way for that final spot. Tottenham are probably going to keep Bale who will once again be a force with Soldado up top. Arsenal, while not spending anything, are more experienced as a team and work together well. United, City, and Chelsea are all very good teams and will be forces to be reckoned with.

&gt;**Dr. Who Titles**

&gt;Watching the abstracted light forms &amp; patterns which appear in the opening sequence of Dr. Who has become a familiar ritual for all of us. The wonder of the opening is that it manages to capture in only a very few moments of screen time the atmosphere of Dr. Who.

&gt;When that blue police box zooms in from a morass of complex light forms, there is no question of it's right to be there. So already, within seconds of starting, the title designer has drawn us into the world of Dr. Who, &amp; suspended our disbelief, setting an atmosphere that allows the rest of the programme to continue unhindered by attempts to justify the reality of what is happening.

&gt;Bernard Lodge, senior BBC graphics designer is the man responsible for 13 years of Dr. Who graphics and 5 opening sequences. The first 3 were done using electronically generated patterns, however, the last 2, Jon Pertwee's second, &amp; perhaps the most successful, Tom Baker's were done using a process called ""slit-scan"" photography. Bernard Lodge explains how it works.....

&gt;""The camera faces a slot behind which is a pattern.(any abstract pattern you wish) The pattern is back-lit &amp; the only part visible to the camera therefore is part seen through the slot. The transparent pattern moves sideways at the same time as the camera tracks towards or zooms towards the slot. During these moves the shutter is locked open to expose only one frame &amp; on that one frame will be recorded a perspective streak kind of pattern. If the slot is say vertical, than a ""Wall"" is made. If the slot is circular the streak resembles a tunnel. The whole process is repeated to make the next frame, but if the start position of the pattern is say 1inch to the left then on the wall of the tunnel the pattern will appear to be fractionally nearer. After about 24 frames the effect of movement down the tunnel is achieved. The movement of the camera and the support carrying the coloured transparent pattern must be motorised so that moves can be accurately repeated. Even without the more expensive equipment we possess you can still achieve interesting results using an 8mm camera equipped with a zoom lens.""

&gt;To achieve results like the Dr. Who titles, one requires more than expensive equipment &amp; technical knowledge, one needs the artistic integrity &amp; sensitivity of a man like Bernard Lodge.

Meanwhile if you want to live there because of work, you will find your money doesn't go far at all.

I am lucky to not be in this situation, but I honestly feel more for those who aren't eligible for the benefits, than those who have been having them for the last few years.

The issue here isn't in the reduction of housing benefit.  It is that we have been growing as a population, but our housing stock hasn't.  That people have been having babies, but not allowing building on the green space near them.

We wouldn't be needing to reduce / cap housing benefit, if housing wasn't so damned expensive.  Sadly no one wants to address that issue.  The flat I live in was £80k not so long ago.  By inflation it should be worth about £120k, but it would probably sell for £320k.  That is the problem.  That is the injustice.

She gave me some more codine and suggested I go to a differen't hospital....

The thing is, I'd booked in via 111, I'd specifically been told to go to that A&amp;E.  I knew it was probably a fracture but wanted to just make sure (plus it hurt a lot and I wanted something to let me sleep).

The other hospital I went to, which was much closer, was by comparison brilliant.  Despite not been booked in, the receptionist was able to get me to see a polynurse within 30 min, who had a very quick check with a Dr before agreeing on things.  I was in and out in an hour, with printed off exercises on a piece of paper.

KDB starting in that position would be much more beneficial from the few matches we've seen so far.

Actually my interest is not for ideology, and I don't think being historically white is negative. It's the seeing new developments in the future of the Doctor, not the history that I am interested in. I think a female doctor or even a non white male would be awesome to watch, I'd think it was amazing. I think it would grow the character and the fanbase and the doctors whole persona.

Thanks to the history I already have 50 years of white male Doctors to look back on, and for the record, love dearly. It's for the sake of the ever growing narrative that I would like to see this eventual expansion. From my understanding, ""englishmen"" come in many colors and at least two genders. 

A ""peoples fiction"" does include me, a lifelong Whovian and a giant supporter of the series (my wedding was Doctor Who themed), in ""the people"" I would assume, as well as everyone else who shared my interest in a more varied face for the Doctor. This story and it's fanbase are bigger than you, or your evident issues with female characters, or possibly just issue with change in general.

It's apparently people like you that think the only value in increasing diversity or variety or inclusion is to meet some political status quo.

I have no interest in everything becoming a ""gay black woman"", or in fact in a static homogeneous culture of any kind. This character is one that takes on new bodies and new faces as a core character trait, and even the shows original creators wanted to see one of them eventually be female. I don't for instance, want Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch to suddenly recast the show with gay black women, because replacing the characters in such a fashion is not within the boundaries of the conventions of the story being told in that show. In Doctor Who that is part of the premise, the Doctor will always have new Faces.

For me, there's only a few North American pro teams you can really compare to LFC because there are only a few teams that have had anywhere near the kind of success Liverpool have had.

2. There are, now, 12 versions of the ""Doctor"" and 3 who didn't go by the name of the Doctor.  Therefore technically there are 15 regenerations of the man but only 12 went by the name ""Doctor""

3.  Amy and Rory's fate was a fixed point in time.  Even if he wanted to go back The TARDIS wouldn't have allowed it.  Remember that while he has somewhat control of the TARDIS she has admitted that she doesn't always take him where he wants to go but where he needs to be.  So yeah, the TARDIS wouldn't have taken him there no matter how much he tried.

4.  The interesting thing is Timelords can control, to some degree, their regenerations.  If they don't want to regenerate they don't really have to but they will die.

My Mam works in social care and has done since 2007. Since then she has been made redundant and been poached by the new contracted company twice. In the process, she has had to accept more hours and responsibilities, with a £6k paycut (So around 25% of her salary since she started, which wasn't much to begin with considering she has a managerial role). She had no choices other than accept the paycuts or become unemployed. It's an NHS funded service, but they have had to start offering services to private clients in order to balance the budget, which is not what the company exists to provide.

Privatisation doesn't help anybody except the business owner(s) who takes a slice off the top.

I'm with you here, but that being said I definitely think he's not only up for it but also completely capable of it. Only one way to find out!

&gt; I'd actually start Oscar centrally over Mata because, perhaps controversially, he's got the potential to be even better than Mata in that position. 

Definitely a bit controversial but I'm not going to disagree at all with you there. Oscar looks so bright and he's only 21! 4 years is a significant difference.

I'd like to see Mata get less than 45 minutes of playing time during the rest of the preseason matches for so many reasons. For one thing, he's a proven and established player. IMO he doesn't need playing time in these matches nearly as badly as KDB, Schürrle, arguably Moses and Oscar as well (definitely Van Ginkel and Bison but they don't compete with Mata obviously). I think the team knows exactly who Mata is and what he can do and we're still figuring that out about some of the other players.

&gt; Moses

Seriously! He's been unreal this preseason! So much energy, I'm loving it. Only 22 years old as well. Here's hoping he keeps this up all season. Also, wasn't it his cross that Schürrle buried at the end of that game? Maybe he'll improve his crossing statistics this season lol.

I'd take that report with a pinch of salt.  Why?  Because they are looking at expenditure on Health as a total, rather than an individual thing.  The USA has this curious attitude of having slums, people in those areas will not have good health.  Not too mention the issues regarding obesity and such.

I love to rip on the USA as much as the next guy.  But this paper is rather *academic* to use it in a political manner is disingenuous.

So the USA has high mortality rates right now?  We know this.  God, the few weeks I was studying in Florida I gained about half a kg a week!  But the premise is also flawed, due to access to healthcare been so atrocious many simply don't have any until too late, but these people are often economically less active.  Okay so this is grim, but it is the premise of the comparison for the paper, and ultimately many Americans views.  Poor people can die, they don't *impact* the economy.  Then you have someone like Steve Jobs who apparently went full retard with his cancer treatment.  He probably chucked bucketloads of cash (all speculation!) at his treatment.  Also since his death Apple's expected future hasn't been so rosy (speculation too, just role with it as a thought exercise!).  The point I'm making is that someone like Jobs death has more impact on the GDP, so he is more willing to spend a lot of cash.  The US health system is un-deniably skewed towards the richer end of the spectrum.  So this will lead to a bad situation, where cheaply treatable illness are not cared for (because they are probably non-white too, sorry Florida, you didn't impress me) but those who are probably beyond any help will have all their money taken away from them.

There are much better arguments against private health, I would suggest the paper Market for Lemons.  This one isn't very well grounded, it's just someone comparing numbers ignoring the micro and macro socio-political implications of them.

I can't speak for other unis or even other courses, but I know that if Manc phys give you an offer then they are happy for you to come as long as you get a minimum grade ,which, realistically, is something more like BBB or there abouts. If you're offered a place, miss out on the official offer grades but get the realistic required grades, then they have their own sort of internal clearing, where you may (or may not, but chances are that they like you) be offered a place on the course.

As long as there is space left -which is the point I was trying to make, because the course is so popular that if they gave a place to everyone who got the realist required grades then they would simply not have the ability to fit everyone in.

Again, this is not a solution to the problem of offering places based on predictions, simply an explanation of why offers are in the state that they are.

To get you out of the bed earlier they would have to employ more pharmacists, nurses and junior doctors in order to discharge you and then ensure you are being discharged with safe and appropriate medicines in a more timely manner. That outweighs the resource of the bed being tied up for a couple of hours, which isn't that big of a problem, there's actually rarely a time when a patient is without a bed, the issue is that the bed might not be in the right ward, and had your bed been needed for a patient you would probably have been sent to the discharge lounge. It's likely the staff just saw no reason to send you to another place to wait which would then also have to be cleaned etc, when you could just stay put.

Furthermore you might have been waiting due to problems resulting from human error, or supply issues.

However I would say that, when asked the question by reporters, Brendan has little option but to say things like this. Any words he utter will be taken by both sides and twisted and if he simply refuses to comment then the argument will be made that Suarez must be going.

If he keeps being asked questions and keeps answering (as he has little option to do) Arsenal fans will say he is getting desperate and keeps going on about it, if he does the opposite and says less Arsenal fans will say he's begun to accept Suarez is leaving. 

Also you cannot simply base an argument that Suarez is likely to leave on the fact that no manager ever says top players are going to leave, if so what are they supposed to say if they really don't have any intention to sell and keep being bombarded with questions about it.

Liverpool travel to Norway with Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard leading the team, liverpool.no has learned. Daniel Agger will probably remain on Merseyside with a knock.

There have been many speculations as to what team Liverpool will bring to Norway for Wednesday's game against Vålerenga, but it apparently will be a strong team at Ullevaal.

Players like Luis Suarez, Steven Gerrard and Coutinho are all travelling, and Brendan Rodgers will probably continue fielding a strong team in this friendly as well as the previous fixtures in preseason.

Daniel Agger will probably not go to Oslo. The defender got a knock against Olympiakos and looks to be sitting this one out.

Anyway, from an objective standpoint, I tend to agree with everything you said. I'm still rather nervous about the idea of selling him, especially to Arsenal, but I do firmly believe that we'll use the money wisely either this month or in January (or both) and further bulk up the squad as a whole in terms of creating competition for places. I have faith in our current transfer setup; they're immeasurably better than what we had with Comolli and Dalglish. We have a strong starting XI (with one or two weaker points that we could address) but could really do with another defensive reinforcement or two.

I still don't want to sell him to Arsenal, although you're right about FWD being your weakest position. As much as you or other gunners may not think so, I honestly see you as a direct rival for 4th..if not this season definitely next season. Our youngsters are really coming into their own (just seeing Sterling, Ibe and Coutinho et al perform this preseason suggests they're all much stronger, spacially aware and more comfortable than they even were before).  I wouldn't want to strengthen a rival (at most, I think the gap between 4th and 6th will be 5 points total)...I guess if I was the club's MD I'd take the Levy approach to domestic transfers and not do any/many! For this reason, there's honestly no price that I'd sell to Arsenal for. Not one that Wenger will want to pay anyway. Just honestly how I feel.

By that I mean a petty, hopeless conflict filled with violence, dirty fighting, and a general sense of hopelessness. We know that in the Time War time was manipulated to just bring back the dead after battles. Imagine being a soldier fighting in that type of war. It is similar to WW1 mass charges across no man's land. Everyone around you is dying, stuff is exploding, people are dying and at the end of the day you know this is all pointless. The trenches you take in that charge will be counter charged and taken back sooner or later and you will have to cross this same piece of land again and again to capture the same trenches over and over again. 

This is how I imagine the Time War. The forces of both sides going out to fight these seemingly glorious, epic battle with, only for the battle to mean nothing once time is manipulated to bring back to dead effectively making the battle irrelevant. All those victories mean nothing, just another day. You watch your friends die over and over again. I imagine them fighting a giant battle, time being shifted and both sides just leaving to rest before they come back the next day to do it all over again. 

I believe this is why the Doctor came back a changed man, why the Council turned to making the Master crazy in their attempt to escape the time lock. In WW1 you see the introduction of violent and dirty fighting. Chemical warfare was introduced on a scale unheard of before. Dirty trench fighting with spades, all of the horrors that make it a war we don't glorify in movies or games nearly as much as WW2. Imagine living through that for a particularly endless amount of time. If you seen the movie All's Quiet on the Western Front a huge point of that movie is how the boys go into the army all patriotic, ready to go join the war and fight for their country. And then when you see them later after becoming veterans of the war they no longer have those feelings, you can see the hopelessness on their faces, they just keep fighting cause that's all they can do. They become numb to the dying around them, jumping out of trenches while putting on gas masks to avoid choking on mustard gas becomes routine to them. Imagine this happening to the Doctor. 

At first he is excited deep down, to finally bring an end to the Daleks, one of the only races he hates. One of the only forms of life he wants completely and utterly ended. So he returns home to lead the armies against them in the glorious last battle against the Daleks. But time travel adds a new dimension of horror that even WW1 can't live up to. No matter how many Daleks are beaten, no matter how many victories the Doctor gains victory is not in sight. Eventually he becomes numb to the war. He just goes through the motions as he tries to figure a way out of the war, to just end it once and for all. As he does more and more races are pulled in, the effects of war start to reach out to places and races that aren't even involved in the conflict.  Never gaining any ground the Doctor becomes desperate, so desperate until finally The Moment comes along. So numb and horrified by the war, what it had done to him and his people, what it was doing to all of time itself the Doctor finally see his chance to end the suffering, end the carnage and so he does it. He ends the time war at all costs. ",0,1375724998,null,0,false,0,cbhgd1b,t3_1jr30h,t1_cbhgd1b,t3_1jr30h,null,1429937055,16,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,16

You, however, posted a pile of crap spouted by the Guardian, one incidentally that always crops up when the NHS gets criticised on reddit. If you bothered to read the source report you'd see that it is a lot more guarded and not quite so ""ZOMG TEH NHS IS AWESOME"" mentality that the Guardian would have you believe. 

From the actual REPORT:

&gt; the USA is a continent and on a range of socioeconomic and health factors there is
considerable variation between the States, not least
marked ethnic variations.
1,5
Although most
Western countries have regional economic vari-
ations, few have the variation of, for example,
California, which is larger than many Western
countries, and Arkansas, et cetera. A second factor
is life or cultural styles of the USA, in particular
the availability of firearms, which impacts upon
mortality rates such as homicide and suicide, far
more than any other Western country, 16,17 placing an extra burden upon USA services.

Not that I am suggesting that the USA is a good model for health care but the report goes in to far more detail than the stupid article you linked to.

It's his entire job to understand the document before his player signs it and if he really didn't take the time to sort that out then he's the one who should be held accountable for the misunderstanding.  He's been gallivanting about hoping to attract interest in his player to help get a move forced through because if a club that fits the profile comes in with a good bid and Liverpool wants to be bullish about it then surely a transfer request would seal the deal.  Obviously the club can deny the request but if the club coming in isn't in the premier league the chances of that happening are quite slim.  

He's probably not agitating for a move to Arsenal because they're not the sort of club he wants.  They're in England (which he wants out of) and only a marginal improvement from us in the sense that he wouldn't be going to a team that is immediately challenging for top honors in everything.  He'd get into the Champion's League with them this season but odds are they won't be going very far in that, won't be challenging for the EPL title, and maybe have a decent shot at a domestic cup run.  If you remove the champion's league part from that then you may as well be talking about Liverpool.  The upgrade just isn't big enough for him to deal with staying in England.  If someone like City or Chelsea came swooping on in then I could see him causing havoc to get the move, which would be really painful.

If he goes (be it this summer or next), it'll be to a different country.  Arsenal is not really a logical choice for him, based on what we know about what he wants (though clearly we can't know all of what he's thinking).

Suarez is being quiet because he knows any word that comes out of his mouth will be like a media nuclear warhead going off and it's almost definitely going to do him way more harm than good, no matter what the statement is.  If he says he's saying then he kills his chances of moving.  If he says he wants to go then he condemns himself to a really terrible time with us in the event there's no suitable club in for him.

true,Geography_Lad,,"tesco value vodka ","Currently reading Albert Camus's *The Outsider* (also known as *The Stranger* or *L'etranger*). Like most of the books I read it was written in the interwar era or post-WWII in the 50s. I mostly read American stuff but do sometimes read European books - I have particularly enjoyed Franz Kafka's *The Trial* and Vladimir Nabokov's *Lolita*. 

In terms of more contemporary books I've recently read Mark Danielewski's *House of Leaves* and have read two novels which have been adapted into well known films - *American Psycho* by Bret Easton Ellis and *The Prestige* by Christopher Priest.  Both of those films are fantastic, but I think the books are just as good, and in the case of *The Prestige* the book is actually very different to the film.

I always struggle with naming a favourite anything, but when it comes to books I can narrow it down to two favourites - JD Salinger's *The Catcher in the Rye* and Joseph Heller's *Catch 22*. Could not be more different stylistically, but both brilliant. My obsession with *Catcher* is really quite powerful. The author, Salinger, wrote some absolutely incredible short stories too - *Nine Stories* (or as it's sometimes titled *For Esme with Love and Squalor and Other Stories*) is the perfect starting point for his short stories.

Time for a fun (or not) fact: The oldest book I've read is *The Age of Innocence* by Edith Wharton. On the subject of 'facts' I don't read a whole lot of non-fiction (except for whatever I need/want to read at university) but I've always enjoyed Bill Bryson's travel books, especially *Notes From a Small Island*. I don't really read much poetry either but I loved Sylvia Plath's *Ariel*.

I guess that's about it from me. I, err, like books. But I'll give a random recommendation to *The Lovely Bones* by Alice Sebold. I didn't like the ending but it was still a good read.

true,DJ_Dont_Panic,null,null,"Time travel mate. You go back and change something in the past, it effects the future, even for The Doctor.

Remember when the word Doctor turned from meaning healer to warrior because of The Doctor's adventures in the past from that point? When the doctor first stole his TARDIS he could have traveled until the end of time from that point, and the whole time the word Doctor would mean healer, but mess with some stuff in the past, go forward again and suddenly things have changed, but only from The Doctor's point of view. Davros, post Genesis of the Dalek, would be none the wiser of how the Daleks creation had turned out differently before hand, as the whole reason the Time Lords sent The Doctor there was to change it. From that moment the future changes and only The Doctor remembers the difference.

The Doctor, as a result of his tampering in time (which was totally against Time Lord rule) has become a fixed point, with the whole universe spinning around him in spacetime. Its the result of the best part of 1,000 years spent changing the outcome of the universe around him to his own desires. It was bound to happen and now the universe is molded around him. It's all very wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey.

Now what you're talking about is a change in the creation of the Daleks, that diverted them off the path through time that they were on before (pre GotD Daleks) and onto the path that we know of. The path into the Time War. Regardless of weather it was mentioned or even known about (We still don't know the ins and outs of the time lock) before John Hurt (assuming he's 8.5), they would still have been on this path since the Time Lords sent Tom Baker's Doctor to Skaro too (unsuccessfully) destroy the Daleks before they were created.

Basically it's the Time Lords faults. They shouldn't have been such hypocrites and broken their own rules. They had it coming.

Fair enough - it's still not as good as the Discworld books anyway. I'm guessing Christopher Moore writes a similar kind of thing, but does it better?

Flashman is brilliant. Including *the Mountain of Light* I've read the first four, and my only complaint would be that the historical backdrops/context can sometimes be a bit much and a little confusing if, like me, you're not familiar with that period.

 Flashman gets himself involved in quite a lot of key events of the era, so if you miss details earlier on you can end up losing track of events. Maybe that's just me though! For the most part though its easy to get to grips with, and the author uses plenty of footnotes which help with the wider history of the people and places, if you're into that sort of thing.

As a protagonist Flashman is fantastic; he's a complete arsehole, but somehow he works. There's a lot of great humour in there too, if you're not too put off by the less than politically correct nature of some of it. So yeah basically, would recommend.

(very) Generally speaking; 

British people don't like to cheer for things that  just exist by default at this point. The exceptions being when the individual has a vested personal/family interest in the subject. Being British isn't that great.

We live on a mainly cold and wet island surrounded by (mostly brown) water. When it's hot, old people die. When it's cold, old people die. There are maybe 2 weeks of the year where it is neither hot, or cold/wet/grey/overcast. 

Our houses are smaller than almost everyone elses. Our public sector is in constant turmoil, our resources are harvested and sold back to us at a premium. Every generation slowly comes to realise that they think it's ""gone to shit"" since they were a child. Whether this is an actual realisation or a ""rose tinted"" view of your childhood doesn't really matter. 

We're apathetic towards animals but other people can fuck off. Unless we notice a direct link to our own financial/personal happiness/wellbeing the answer is often- ""meh, doesn't affect me. Don't care.""

The segments were alright, the teams and captains were funny, the rivalry was fun to watch, jamelia was entertaining. I personally Didn't like Gabi Logans fake enthusiasm, you could see in her face she was only doing this because she was getting paid, not because it's what British people do. 

Unlike say an American audience, there aren't many whoops and cheers, expressions of happiness when people's hometowns get mentioned. It's a groan of acknowledgement. How can you cheer for something you know is shit? I mean actually know, you lived there, you experienced the place, the people. As U.K. residents we generally can acknowledge the bad, it's our mess, we made it.

I genuinely really like Suarez as a person off the field. I know that's an opinion that you can really only get away with on this subreddit, but I feel like he's really misunderstood. He comes from a culture where it's OK to do *whatever* it takes on the pitch go win. It's celebrated in Uruguayan street ball culture. Call a guy something racist, bite him, do whatever it takes to win and you're good to go. After the game we all shake hands and go home to our families.

Except in the British media, you can't just go home. They hound you and your family. Paparazzi, rabid fans, libelous journos. Luis can't even go to the store without 100 people wanting pictures, and another 100 shouting profanity at him while his young daughter is standing there. Add to this the fact that it's not even *his* culture, one that speaks his language. I don't think he expected this, and I'm sure he'd go back and do it differently if he could. At the end of the day he just wants to go home and play with his kid. Once the villain narrative takes off, though, it's so hard to reverse.

He's not going anywhere this season, because FSG, Ayre, and Rodgers are in complete control and know exactly what they're doing. Suarez will give 100% on the pitch because he's a winner and he cares about his lifetime stats as a Uruguayan footballer. I truly believe we will make top four this year with Luis leading the charge.

&gt; Firstly, “road tax” does not exist, and has not existed since the 1930s. What drivers do pay, however, is Vehicle Excise Duty, which is often known as road tax but is not strictly the same thing. Vehicle Excise Duty - what you pay for your car’s tax disc - is based on your vehicle’s emissions. Since a bike creates no emissions, it is not liable for Vehicle Excise Duty.

&gt;I'm not a fan of government much but at least if the money instead went to them (or higher wages) it would boost the economy more than sitting in the bank accounts of the rich, being spent elsewhere on villas and buying personal islands

It is not the governemnts money. When company makes a profit they get taxed a bit but then it is theirs, there are british companies trading in other countries, do you think that if I sell something to a french dude that I cannot keep my profit but have to spend it in france?

&gt;Secondly, we have no clue about Eccleston being in the 50th until it's over and the credits role.

True. However, if the only thing on which we can base any speculation is the official source that he won't be returning, conjecturing that we'll see McGann/Hurt regenerate into Eccleston is even more wishful than the alternative of conjecturing that the 50th will somehow have to make do without Eccleston. 

Also, *roll, not role. 

&gt;Thirdly, the Doctor absolutely deserves a happy ending.

No, I don't buy that. One thing I love about the idea of the Doctor in *Doctor Who* is that he is a very atypical hero. For all the good that he does, for how many times he has saved lives, he's not someone who can ever retire or die happily. Ever since he told Susan that he would return for her, he's always been running. It's such a great contrast to have this swashbuckling, daring hero who is so sad and so alone.

He can have happy moments, yes, he can have good moments. But one of the things that has made the Doctor such an enduring character for generations is that he always leaves his friends behind. Or they leave him. Ultimately, there's no happiness in that. 

If you give him a happy ending, that wipes the slate clean of everything he's ever done. Not just the Time War, because that's been discussed so much that it's starting to lose meaning, but everything before that, every empire and army that fell to pieces because of what he did. Even in ""The Doctor's Wife"", Amy correctly surmises that the Doctor is looking for forgiveness, and who is left who could forgive him?

Do I want the Doctor to have an unhappy ending? That raises the question, do I want the Doctor to have an ending? It's already been said that the Doctor meets his end at a mild skirmish at Trenzalore, so that implies that his death is not a pleasant one. That said, that ""ending"" is only good until the next story to show/mention his ending is. 

So, do I want the Doctor to have an unhappy ending? I think it's more dramatically interesting. The Doctor wouldn't be as compelling a character if he lived happily ever after. There is always a sense of darkness, a sense of shadow that both follows him and comes from him. He ran away from Gallifrey, he never made good on his promise to his granddaughter, he's done awful, terrible things in his life. Giving him a happy ending almost negates all those things, mitigates all those things. 

He'll have good days, as I said - meets a new companion, meets an old friend, saves a life, saves the planet, saves the universe, etc. He certainly *deserves* a happy ending, but one of the great tragedies of *Doctor Who* is that he almost certainly will never get one.

I don't know a great deal about the history of the club, given that I'm a fairly young supporter, but I'll try and summerise the more recent years. Anyway, Norwich are quite a small club compared with the league giants such as Manchester United or Chelsea. But even playing these teams was just a big dream a few years back. After being a midtable side in the championship, Norwich were relegated at the end of a long and painful season (2008/09) for us supporters.

What made matters worse for us that the opening day of the next season when discussion was taking place about us bouncing up again, we were absolutely destroyed by a Colchester side 7-1 in a game which saw a couple of fans run onto the pitch and chuck season tickets at club staff.  It only took a few weeks for our manager to leave, and astonishingly Paul Lambert - Colchester's manager at the time - was appointed as our head coach not long after. That season saw us become champions, and we had made a few club heroes in the process with Grant Holt being the most prominent.

Once we were back in the Championship, I just hoped we could stay there. New players were brought in and we looked a strong side and actually managed to get promotion again, this time finishing second in the league.

Now we had what was really our long term goal: Premier League football. All we had to do was keep it... and astonishingly we did it despite being favourites to go down and being pretty much ignored by all TV pundits. We had finished a respectable 12th place, but it was announced later that year that our beloved Paul Lambert was leaving.

For last season, we were worried yet again. ""Second season syndrome"" were the words uttered by football fans up and down the UK, myself included. Under a new manager, nobody knew what was going to happen. Chris Hughton brought in some fantastic signings such as Bassong, Bunn and Snodgrass, but still kept many of our heroes from the League One days. We started off well, and just before Christmas we had gone 10 games unbeaten. Surely there was no possibility of relegation? Just a couple of months later however, things were getting shaky but against all odds, plucky little Norwich pulled it off and managed to finish 11th, with victories against Spurs, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal.

Now what? Nobody really knows. Here at Norwich we've always been a small club. Buying British players for small amounts and always doing better than expected. Now things are different. We are spending a lot of money on big players (Wolfswinkel and Hooper to name a couple) and we have been praised by the media, with many predicting a top half finish.

I worked at central London hospital trust back in 2002 and encountered so many issues that were the result of privatisation and piss poor management (The NHS needs to get rid of most of their useless managers as they do not have a clue. They are just a bunch of business school bullshitters).

The facilities system was outsourced and maintenance costs went through the roof. I saw direct evidence of this when I went to a particular department and pointed out that one of their light-bulbs had blown and required replacing.

They told me that they were going to leave it and replace it themselves when it was a bit quieter, showed me the invoices from previous replacements and explained the following:

They would put a call into the helpdesk. The helpdesk would send that call over to facillities and at some point, someone would come to look at the work, carrying out a risk assessment. They would then go away and at a later point, someone else would return with a ladder and a replacement light-bulb. This would take 3 or 4 days and the invoice from the previous time was for just over £320.

The lightbulb was an inferior quality one which wouldnt last long very long so it was almost a case that it was a revenue stream.

In the end they just purchased some decent quality ones and would replace themselves on the quiet.

The guy I worked for was the desktop hardware supplier. I was visiting departments, rolling out new desktops, inserting the machine onto the domain and also installing printers and other peripherals. I was expected to roll out around 8 - 10 machines a day across various sites.

The machines were 1Ghz Pentium 3, 1 Gb RAM composed of all generic parts. I priced a machine up and estimated that it would be around £400 - £600 and that wasnt a bulk price. I saw the invoice when I was rolling out 2 machines to the teen cancer ward and he was charging £1500 per machine.

Now you can accept that some cost is maintenance/service delivery but not over 3 times the cost.

There was one evening when we were having a drink after work and our boss put his card behind the bar and let the directors from the main IT contractor get pissed on it. I overheard them saying to him about sticking with them as (because of an upcoming situation which would mean a huge uplift program) they would all be riding the gravy train.

Yes, now I regret stooping to that level. Apologies. 

&gt;Doctor Who has always been about life AND death, thus the comedy aspect.

Wellllllllll, *Doctor Who* started being an educational science show for children (although that lasted for all of three weeks). I forget when it took on these dimensions of life and death, but I'm glad it moved away from that, even as people on the 1960s equivalent of reddit kicked and screamed that the show was betraying its roots.

&gt;Remember when Amy accused the Doctor of just wanting to be forgiven in The Doctor's Wife? 

Well...yes, I mentioned it in an earlier post in this conversation. 

&gt;It would be outright cruel to continue to subject the character to being a monster.

For me, I think it wouldn't be very compelling to absolve him of all his sins. It's what he wants, obviously, and it's what he deserves - and to me, *that's* great drama, great tension. A continuing journey, a quest that will never be satisfied.

My psychologist once told me that I'm locked into a negative view of things, so that's probably what I draw from *Doctor Who*. A show this long, this all-encompassing, represents different things to different people. At this juncture, there isn't one ""right"" answer. It's science fiction! It's Greek tragedy. It's fantasy! It's comedy! It's adventure! It's drama! It's for kids! It's for families! 

Or, at the risk of entering a new dimension, *it's all those things, and so much more*.

What have you read? - Shit loads over the years.

What's your favourite?  - A Handful of Dust - Evelyn Waugh

And what do you recommend? - See below!


Big fan of books. Got a degree in Eng Lit and drama and have a big interest in 1920-1935 African-American authors (The Harlem Renaissance).

Last Read: Vile Bodies - Evelyn Waugh. Fantastic satire by one of Britain's best. Absolutely hilarious book. Incredibly dry and witty narration, as well as a distinct 'modern' feel which you don't often get with other Waugh novels. Fantastically bleak ending and a great tone change towards the middle of the novel. The whole thing is a satire on traditional romantic comedies and Adam's and Nina's relationship is just beautifully shallow and empty. Would definitely recommend this and a lot of other Waugh (A Handful of Dust is my favourite novel of his).

For novels from the Harlem Renaissance (if anyone is interested in this incredible period of time), I'd recommend *Passing* by Nella Larsen, which is often overlooked because of her better novel *Quicksand*, but I personally think it brings a great deal to the table in regards to the unreliable narrator trope. It concerns women who are light skinned enough to 'pass' for white in society, and two friends who have chosen different stances in regards to doing this.

Other fantastic mentions from this period:

* Their Eyes were Watching God by Zora Nealse Hurston
* The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois

Also anything and everything by Langston Hughes and Alain Locke, who had different ideas about the construction of a distinctly African, or African-AMERICAN identity in regards to the African-Americans of the time. They really did polarize a lot of writers with their thoughts, and you should check out the essays, 'The Negro Artist and the Racial mountain' by Hughes, and 'Enter the New Negro' by Locke.

Here's two snippets to give you and idea of their stances:

Hughes:

&gt;One of the most promising of the young Negro poets said to me once, ""I want to be a poet--not a Negro poet,"" meaning, I believe, ""I want to write like a white poet""; meaning subconsciously, ""I would like to be a white poet""; meaning behind that, ""I would like to be white."" And I was sorry the young man said that, for no great poet has ever been afraid of being himself. And I doubted then that, with his desire to run away spiritually from his race, this boy would ever be a great poet. But this is the mountain standing in the way of any true Negro art in America--this urge within the race toward whiteness, the desire to pour racial individuality into the mold of American standardization, and to be as little Negro and as much American as possible.

http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/hughes/mountain.htm

Locke:

&gt;UP to the present one may adequately describe the Negro’s “inner objectives” as an attempt to repair a damaged group psychology and reshape a warped social perspective. Their realization has required a new mentality for the American Negro. And as it matures we begin to see its effects; at first, 
negative, iconoclastic, and then positive and constructive. In this new group psychology we note the lapse 
of sentimental appeal, then the development of a more positive self-respect and self-reliance; the 
repudiation of social dependence, and then the gradual recovery from hyper-sensitiveness and “touchy” 
nerves, the repudiation of the double standard of judgment with its special philanthropic allowances and 
then the sturdier desire for objective and scientific appraisal; and finally the rise from social 
disillusionment to race pride, from the sense of social debt to the responsibilities of social contribution, 
and off-setting the necessary working and commonsense acceptance of restricted conditions, the belief in 
ultimate esteem and recognition. Therefore, the Negro today wishes to be known for what he is, even in 
his faults and shortcomings, and scorns a craven and precarious survival at the price of seeming to be 
what he is not. He resents being spoken for as a social ward or minor, even by his own, and to being 
regarded a chronic patient for the sociological clinic, the sick man of American Democracy. For the same 
reasons, he himself is through with those social nostrums and panaceas, the so-called “solutions” of his 
“problem,” with which he and the country have been so liberally dosed in the past. Religion, freedom, 
education, money ⎯ in turn, he has ardently hoped for and peculiarly trusted these things; he still 
believes in them, but not in blind trust that they alone will solve his life-problem.

Two different figures writing at the same time about what it truly means to be black. Such interesting stuff.

Other recommendations from me:

* The Complete stories of Saki - Hector Hugh Munro, these are nice short satires of Edwardian life. He is known as the master of the short story!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saki 

* Gay writings from India by Yaarna

India's first gay anthology is full of stories, poems, prose, and plays which are actually really well chosen and interesting. Great to read about homosexual relationships and relations from an eastern perspective. Might be difficult to get hold of but I recommend it.

The posting of the recent history is summed up very well by /u/Hammezjj . The only things to add are the other big signings this summer (Garrido, Fer, Redmond, Hooper, Wolfswinkel, Olson). 

Norwich's best times before now were 1992/93 when Norwich finished 3rd behind Man u and Villa and became the only English team to beat Bayern Munich away. (That record still stands as Bayern changed stadium a few years ago) It was a 2-1 win with Jeremy Goss scoring a screamer of a volley. Players of that time who were rather good included Chris Sutton, Robert Fleck and Jeremy Goss.

Norwich are notably the only premier league team without any debt (I believe) and are aso very secluded with the nearest premier league rivals being Arsenal. Ipswich are of course our big rivals; the derby days are very heated. We beat them 4-1 and 5-1 in our promotion season!

I can't go into this too much as I have an ongoing legal issue and anonymity wishes but suffice to say, the care system in this country is a fucking disgrace and I hope I croak before I get anywhere near one of them. 

The company I'm concerned with, HC1 are abysmal. I could fill this thread with horror stories, all hand waved aside by senior management and all the while they are sucking money from the system which means direct cuts to essential care services, to satisfy the shareholders. The company is an estimated £5 billion in debt and almost all of the big players involved in the conglomerate are using off shore tax havens, so at whatever cost, no matter how bad it gets, they still preserve their premiums and pay as little tax as possible.

It's fucking scandalous and after watching 3 old folk who I dearly loved die miserable deaths in their care, I'm certainly ready for a fight to put these essential services back into the public's hands and for people to stop making money off of them.

/u/cstwig suggested this formation to correct me (informing me that Costa prefers to play on the left)

-------   Sturridge

Costa - Coutinho - Suarez


With a now ""natural"" left sided player, it allows Coutinho to play through the middle as he prefers anyway, leaving Sturridge to lead the line as he likes and Suarez's versatility means he can still be dangerous from the right, or rotate with Sturridge and allows for options like Sterling / Aspas / Ibe / Downing etc to come in on both wings. With Lucas and Gerrard sitting behind the front 4 as a CDM and Deep Lying Playmaker respectively. I think it's our strongest line-up. Obviously Costa and  Suarez could push up more from LAM and RAM to LF and RF respectively. 

However if you invert the midfield 3 and move Coutinho out to the left, that then free's up the ""box to box"" midfield role, which is where I think Rodgers sees Allen and Henderson fitting in naturally.

I feel that the constant viewpoint switching makes the plot lag horribly.

I'm all for not mollycoddling your audience, but plot developments that don't involve somebody shuffling off this mortal coil would be nice.  Then we have to see each protagonist's reaction, and the cycle starts over.

That coupled with the lack of genuinely likable characters and the willingly falling into the fantasy trap of needlessly long descriptions, and there just wasn't enough to keep me interested.

true,WonkaCheeseburger,null,Let's be having you!,"I'm really looking forward to the new season. Hughton came in last year, and had a very tough act to follow in Paul Lambert. The aim was always going to be survival at any cost. Hughton came in, shored up the defence, and gave the team a strong defensive emphasis that many regarded as overly negative.

It wasn't always pretty to watch - there was some very uninspiring, turgid football, and around February/March there was a real fear that we could go down. In the end, we were well clear, but there were clearly improvements to be made, particularly going forward.

The summer has proven Hughton knows exactly what he is doing. We are free of all external debt, and were finally able to exert some financial muscle. All the areas fans identified as needing improving, Hughton has done - and with real quality. In particular, Ricky van Wolfswinkel, Leroy Fer, and Nathan Redmond are exciting, young players who will likely give us a few years' service before leaving for a large profit. 

Last year we had one clear starting XI, with no Plan B. As a result, midway through last season teams could neutralise us fairly easily, hence an inordinate amount of 0-0s. As yet, preseason hasn't made clear what the preferred starting lineup will be, which suggests that we'll have at least a Plan B, maybe a Plan C. 

Realistically, I think we'll end up mid table, but there's no reason why we can't go for a top half finish. I would predict 9th. ",0,1375735428,null,0,false,0,cbhkjpi,t3_1jr4to,t1_cbhkjpi,t3_1jr4to,null,1429935089,3,false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,3

The main problem I can see you having is the Czech Republic and Hungary not being in the Euro yet. I don't know of any cards specifically for those nations.

That said if you're travelling in the Eurozone I would get one. I went for the Caxton card because they had the best reputation and recommendations about 2 years ago when I was looking at these sort of cards.

You've probably figured out how these things work. You link the card to a bank account of your choosing. Before you travel, log in to your account on the currency card's website and choose to top up. If you top up with, say, €200 it will charge you the equivalent in £ out of your bank account, so about £180 at current rates.

Once you're topped up you can use the card abroad - I just withdraw cash every few days at ATMs. Obviously if you have €200 topped up once that's run out you would have to top up again. Much easier taking €300 or €400 abroad topped up on a card than in a huge wad of cash.

The Caxton card is currently backed by Visa so it'll work pretty much everywhere abroad. I've used mine in France, Italy and the Canary Islands so far without problems. If you forget your PIN there's a 24-hour automated helpline to recover it.

Due to the cessation of domestic league football during World War One and World War Two, the 2012-13 season was the the Club's 100th in competitive league action.

We originially played in blue and white and we were nicknamed the Citizens. In 1907-8 we changed our crest and kit colours and officially took on the nickname, The Canaries. 

That very same season we built a football ground on quarry, which was aptly named [The Nest](http://downatthelane.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Nest-.jpg) and we played there until 1935 when we moved to Carrow Road. 


Unfortunately there aren't many places on the internet to find out about our history. There are a couple of fan made sites documenting the history of the club. [Flown From The Nest](http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/features/great.htm) has compiled a list of every person to play for Norwich since at least the 80s - including trialists and youth players. 
[Sing Up The River End](http://canaryseventyninety.blogspot.co.uk/p/short-history.html) also has plenty of interesting information and pictures throughout our history and all the blog posts are tagged by decade so you can find some interesting stuff around our formation and early years there.

Hope this helps!

She desired the ability the definitively control the outcome of her appearance upon regeneration and attempted to learn how do this by studying Koturian Phasing. Her attempt failed, however, because she was not in love with the man she was engaged to, which was the catalyst for Phasing. (PROSE: Something Borrowed) The Master stated and achieved his intention to make his next regeneration as young as the Tenth Doctor appeared at the time. (TV: Utopia). Melody Pond announced she was ""focusing on a dress size"" in her final regeneration. She also commented that she might ""take down the age a bit, just to freak people out,"" although she did not elaborate whether this was a joke or a literal intention. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler) Romana seemed adept enough at the process to custom design her new form during what seemed to be a voluntary regeneration, trying several bodies before finally deciding on a copy of Princess Astra. The Doctor criticised Romana for taking on the form of another person, suggesting such things were not unheard of. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks) In contrast to Romana, the Doctor did not seem to have much control over his post-regeneration appearance; after his fourth regeneration, he commented ""That's the problem with regeneration, you never quite know what you're going to get.""

Angel own all of the Pendolino trains, Virgin just lease and operate them. As we saw last summer when First were pencilled in to take over, the trains would have been leased to them instead.

Virgin have been very good at the PR angle and would have you believe they funded the trains and track improvements out of their own pocket when in fact both were specified in the original franchise they took on.

At least Virgin got to choose their own trains.

true,yggdrasiliv,lfc99,,"The Oilers started in 1960 as a founding member of the AFL, owned by Bud Adams, local oil millionaire.  Things went well for many years, even though Bud Adams was seen as a bit of a dick by everyone who interacted with him.

They played in Jeppeson Stadium (now Robertson Stadium) at the University of Houston, then at Rice Stadium, and at the Astrodome, starting in 1968.  Things went relatively well until the mid 80's when Adams decided the Oilers were limited in revenue by their small stadium.  The Astrodome only had 50,000 seats and had the smallest seating in the NFL.  Much of that was due to [this screen](http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/scoreboard/HRSpectacular1.jpg) which was 745 feet wide and took up space for 10,000 seats.  (And was awesome and gave the stadium a lot of personality)

After threatening to leave the city to move to Jacksonville in the mid 80s, the city approved funds to remove the screen and replace them with 10,000 more seats.  This was funded by a 30 year municipal bond, which the city is still repaying along with tax increases.  

After failing to win the Super Bowl in 1993, Adams blew up the squad by getting rid of as many of the highly paid stars as he could.  The next year the team was awful and they stayed bad the rest of the time they were in Houston.  At this time Adams went to the city to ask for the new stadium.  Many people think this was because he wanted to leave, and so he was setting up an environment where he knew fan support would not be passionate and he could get NFL approval to move.  Adams was pushing for a brand-new taxpayer funded stadium, because the recently upgraded Astrodome no longer provided the revenue he expected because of a lack of luxury boxes and other high-end amenities.

Having very recently done publicly unpopular stadium upgrades int he recent past and with the memories of the 80s oil crash still fresh, the city was less than excited about the possibility of building a new stadium for the Oilers (and simply hostile towards the idea of Adams benefiting from it).  Nashville jumped in and offered $200M+ via a combination of direct money and guaranteed tickets.  This was extremely enticing to Adams because the city of Houston had grown weary of his antics and had started to push back on his demands.  In my opinion, had he sold the club to someone else, it quite likely would have been able to obtain the funding and approval from the city for a new stadium. ( There is a massive amount of ill-will towards him now, but it doesn't actually seem to be any higher than when the team was here.  People just dealt with it in the way you deal with a crazy relative.) 

Houston, which is right in the middle of (American) football country did not have a team for 6 years.  As I type that it looks like a much shorter time than it felt.  It basically felt like forever.  Every Sunday you'd turn on the games, and there was no one there you cared about.  It was an extremely sad time.  Except for Tennessee games, in those games there was a lot of passion (by me) in wanting them to lose every single game by massive margins and have their newly purchased home supporters boo them off the field.  In fact, I'm still like that when it comes to their games.

The Tennessee team (which used to be the Houston Oilers) is in the same division as the team which replaced the Oilers which made for an instant rivalry with much vitriol on the Houston side of things.  The Texans, (the team which ""replaced"" the Oilers in 2002) have a rather... underwhelming name, but that's neither here nor there.  The Texans did not move from anywhere else, but were a newly created team, with a franchise-fee of an eye-watering $700M, for which all McNair received was the right to own an NFL team ) The city also built a [new stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliant_Stadium) which cost $352M, however before the stadium ever opened a $300M naming-rights deal had been struck with Reliant Energy.

IIRC, because our electricity comes from the national grid, the companies are just resellers of the energy that is collectively supplied to it. Green energy companies are considered a more ethical option because of the renewable energy suppliers they claim to invest their profits in.

In short though, I don't know to what extent they can ensure the overall supply to the grid is renewable in proportion to that promised to the consumer. It's an interesting question.

In light of the discussion on privatisation, it makes sense to me to support companies who make bold claims about being less profit-motivated.

-------------- Cech -------------

--Ivanovic -- Cahill -- Luiz -- Cole--

------ Essien --- Mikel ------

--- Moses --- Ba --- Schurrle ----

------ ----- Lukaku -------------

(I'm not sure on available players, so if there is someone here who isn't going to be available, my bad)

It's not your typical lineup, and I understand players like Mata and Hazard are ""must have players"", but I honestly think Hazard is not consistent and I have had a problem with this since he joined, as good as he is some days, he does not impress me all of the time, and I do think in another position he'd evolve into a better player, if anything, he's wasted there (rather have him as a CF if he's comfortable) - So I've gone with Schurrle as a starter.

Mata, Torres, Oscar or potentially Hazard, I'd like them to take advantage of a tired Real Madrid. I find if we bring on Lukaku late on in the game, he won't have the same impact as say Torres. And the same can be said for Ba, but the reason I've put Ba behind Lukaku is that he has a great finish, but he lacks pace, and if Lukaku can push the defence back, which he normally does through strength, Ba could in theory take advantage of the space in front of him.

Essien is a great CDM, always has been, and Mikel I find is in form as of late (look at his highlight video against Spain not too long ago, amazing). Luiz isn't a big liability anymore, and if he does push through, he has some solid people around him.

Now I know Azpi is faster than Ivanovic, but he's probably going to be against Ronaldo in that position, and I'd rather have Ivanovic and Cahill defending against Ronaldo than Azpi and Cahill. You have Essien on that side, and I have seen that when Azpi is under pressure he can get sloppy (and he did give out a penalty or two last season because of this), so with Ronaldo's footwork this could be a problem, so I'd rather have him off.

Guessing wise, we're probably going to start with Hazard, Torres and Mata, but you never know (this is just a team I'd love to see start).

This means that they can be forced to pay a wind generator at the same time as paying a coal plant to stay off. This is in the name of making wind viable. The problem isn't that wind isn't competitive in its own right. The issue is that lots of wind generates simultaneously which drives down the price significantly.

What you pay for is merely an promise that what all of the meters of your supplier will match how much they bought in a year (roughly). I happen to buy my electric from EDF who also happen to run hunterston where Glasgow's electric mostly comes from. No matter who I buy from the actual energy will come from there.

The main issues with the energy industry in my experience aren't from the cost of generation as most might expect but from gaming the system. You can be paid extra to generate and to not generate which is far mor lucrative. The other bug earner is reserve. A company will be paid to hold generation capacity that will never be used. See Inverkip as a historical example or most gas plants now. We also subsidise pump storage enormously. I guarantee it's one of if not the big earner for for most companies that have the plant.

It isn't even clear what was said (on Suarez's part, everyone knows what Robinson said).  Ibrahimovic has done much worse... as has Ronaldo.  No, he isn't a ballhog.  

Let's make it simple.  I'll just compare him to Bale for obvious reasons since it fits in with the theme of my argument.  Suarez had 11 total assists last season in all competitions.  Bale had 11 total assists in all competitions.  As of March (because I'm too lazy to find another article and this is more than sufficient) he created 69 chances not including assists.  How many had Bale created?  36.  Suarez had 1036 completed passes... Bale only had 33 more at 1069.  Suarez played predominantly as a striker for the first half of the season, which is certainly a majority of games at the point these stats were calculated in March.  So you mean to tell me a player that passes as often as a winger/attacking midfielder, creates more chances, and has as many assists as said winger is a ball hog that should leave because he's a detriment to ""team play?""

Here's my thinking: despite his goal, I think Allen's (lack of) finishing showed that he's better suited to provide competition for the Lucas (CDM) role. Someone like Henderson, who is stronger at getting fwd, was more effective, especially at home where we won't need two holding midfielders. Is it fair to conclude that if BR was comfortable enough to play Stewie at LB, that he's sound enough defensively to play in the midfield? See squad below (backup/competition in parentheses)

Fees for ""American"" students at UK institutions can often be cheaper than in the States. You mentioned $20k/term fees, so what's that, $40, $60k/year? I've never been certain if semesters are half or a third of the year. Anyway, at my uni (top-10, Russell Group), fees for non-EU students range from £13.5-24.6k/year, depending on course, with most non-sciences falling into the £13.5 category, and only medicine costing the maximum. Of course, these are purely illustrative - institutions can charge what they like, and often they will.

Still, $40k is about £26k, so even in the ""worst case"" scenario, tuition itself would be cheaper. I know of several Americans who've opted to study here on the grounds of cost. On the other hand, living costs would be more expensive, so you've gotta weigh it all up. One thing I will say though is that we ADORE international students, since they're basically a cash cow, so we put on plenty of programs and stuff to make them as integrated as possible.

true,rydleo,null,null,"First, he moans at players all the time about passing, with the eye rolls and arm waving whenever something happens he doesn't like.  Robinson just stands out since he had the balls to say something back to him.

Also, you're using the transfermarkt stats, which is fine, but they include things like 'converted penalties' as assists.  In reality, he had 5 league assists.  Sturridge had 3 in 1/3 the minutes.  Van Persie had 9 in about the same number of minutes and you're correct in that Bale did not have very many which to me is kind of surprising (4, I think it was).

Suarez had a lot of passes because he plays in a pass-and-move system, so that's not entirely unexpected.  But he also had 2.4 turnovers per game, the 2nd highest in the league in that metric and 12th highest in all of Europe.  If he would perhaps pick his head up a bit more rather than trying (and failing) at 8 nutmegs per game, this would probably be lower.  

Suarez's shot to goal ratio was better this year, although still not at the standard required or expected from a striker, but it was absolutely awful the year before at 5%.  The guy takes as almost as many shots per game as Carzola and Giroud combined for Arsenal last year.

For these reasons and just watching him play, yes, I do think he's a bit of a ballhog.

true,Film-Noir-Detective,mcgann,McGann,"I personally don't like Moffat because, while he does a great job writing individual episodes, he doesn't do a great job as a showrunner. His plot arcs are built up, but often don't deliver on the huge revelations that were promised, often going for a safer, obvious solution (ie. River's identity). His new revelations also cause plot holes to appear in his earlier seasons (ie. Who blew up the TARDIS? The Silence doesn't make much sense because the only reason they want to kill the Doctor is to save the universe by stopping the asking of the question, which would mean they destroy the universe to save it). His plot threads are less threads and more like trees, where he decides to pick a branch and ignore and not address the others things that come up. Madame Kovarion and the Silence are still out there Moffat, and shouldn't, due to the more high profile things the Doctor has recently done, shouldn't they try to kill him again, or are they, and their plot points, slink away.

Some of the hate also comes from the format of this past season (ie. No Two-Parters), and the quality drop that came with it, as most of the season felt rushed. Also, I sincerely believe he messed up Amy and Rory departure, as it didn't fit the foreshadowing that was giving to it.

I also prefer the Davies era, because, while some of it was cheesy, it was a fun sort of cheesy. The bad stuff of Davies era was, most of the time, still fun to watch (Love and Monsters and Fear Her excluded). The bad stuff in Moffat's era is a dull, boring kind of bad. I can more easily sit through the Slitheen episodes, bad as they are, than say, The Power of Three, or Curse of the Black Spot.

I don't like River as a character, as she and her arc, were too drawn out, and I found myself liking her less and less as time went on. There is also her... ahem... Mary Sue-like qualities, which rubbed me the wrong way. In this recent season, she also felt VERY forced in, as her arc had already finished, yet they kept putting her in (Angels Take Manhatten, oh look, she's a private detective. What is she doing here, and why is she here. I don't know). This ties in to another problem, he keeps characters even though they're arcs are finished (ie. Amy and Rory don't really change as characters past ""Let's Kill Hitler"", and there was nowhere for them to develop in 7-1). Also, did they really need to divorce is AofD, I mean, it was back to status quo by the episode's end, if you wanted to do that, make it the point of the arc by having them get back together over the season, instead of ONE EPISODE.

I also don't like the mysteries of the companion, as they pulled attention away from the Doctor and turn him into more of a side character. Now, a companion mystery is good, if used carefully, and not having your entire era filled with them. There was Amy and the Crack first, then Amy and the Baby, then most recently Clara. The Doctor only picks up companions when he wants to find something about them that doesn't make sense, instead of choosing companions whom he wants to travel with, and have fun adventures with over the universe. The companion is more important than the adventure is a problem in the Moffat era, as there are no normal companions who just want to see the universe. The most well loved companions are that type (ie. Ace, Charley, and Donna), and it brings the focus back to the adventure.

And... we're done. Now even though I ranted for a bit, I still adore the show and the only reason I am complaining is because I want to see it get better. The Name of the Doctor, even though it would have been better as a two-parter, is a great episode and a step in the right direction for the era as well as the series. I enjoy most of the episodes, though I enjoy the Davies era more. Here hoping that the 50th anniversary is good, and that there are more Doctors and companions than mentioned. Heck, the Big Finish 50th anniversary episode has more Doctors than the actual anniversary (5 vs. 2 + John Hurt). Looking forward to the new series and the Capaldi era.

true,zfpm,lfc99,,"Accountant here. The amortisation of contracts (an intangible asset) is non-cash and is purely for the books, it is the expensing of an asset over the period of it's useful life. Eg. 4 year contract worth 4m will be amortised 1m each year. This allows companies to distribute their expenses over time so that they don't have to take a single massive hit to their profit &amp; loss in the year the asset is purchased. Think of it as distributing the accounting expense as the economic benefits of the contract are being consumed.

The cash component is the other side of the accounting entry. As explained in a post above, every contract is different. If the contract was to be paid in full, the accounting entry would be to record the 4m contract as an intangible asset, and reduce the cash balance by 4m. If it was to be paid in two installments, the 4m contract would be recorded, the cash balance would be reduced by 2m and a liability would be raised for 2m, meaning that the club still owes 2m for the contract.

true,DHChemist,null,null,"I don't think current players have been touched on too much, I'd say our key players from last year were Ruddy, Bassong, Johnson and Snodgrass, and we've done well to retain all of them. With the possible exception of Johnson (I'll get to him), I imagine all will play big roles this season.

In terms of signings, we've already spent more this summer than in the previous two years we've been a Prem side, so we're expecting big things from, in particular Van Wolfswinkel (our record signing), Fer and Hooper. From watching Van Wolfswinkel in the tail-end of last season, he looks a real talent, and he scored a brilliant hat-trick against Braga. There's a video of him online somewhere scoring a back-heel from the edge of the box which is pretty special, and I believe Mancini described him as the best striker Man City came up against in the Europa league this year. Fer is another exciting signing for us, as last season we struggled in central midfield to really control games, and with his tough tackling, speed, desire to break forward, and (supposedly, not seen this yet) his passing range, we're hoping he's like his role model Yaya Toure.

As to formations, 4-2-3-1 was the norm last season, with Hoolahan behind a lone striker being almost the sole source of creativity in the middle of the pitch. I would guess next season we'll play a similar way away from home, but at home 4-4-2 may be more common, albeit still with two more defensive central midfielders. A guess at our first line-up of the season would be:
Ruddy
Whittaker, Bassong, Bennett, Olsson
Fer, Johnson/Howson
Snodgrass Pilkington
Hooper, Van Wolfswinkel

For next season, once again avoiding relegation is the stated aim, but I think the improvements to the squad mean a top half finish isn't impossible. Personally I'd be happy to see us comfortably mid-table and well out of any relegation scrap. Our problem last season was creating goal-scoring opportunities, and we were very reliant on set-pieces and crosses.

true,lomoeffect,null,null,"&gt; Firstly, Mata is a definite lock at the number 10 position (just behind the striker) as he is obviously one of the best players in the premier league (and in the world). Rooney enjoys occupying that space which the number 10 has a lot as he isn't a front line striker.

That's not true. He is not a definite lock in that position. Mourinho has already stated his intentions to try using him on the wing as a right winged, left footer who cut inside like Robben, Pandev, Di Maria etc did. This puts Oscar centrally. Of course, this isn't permanent and I imagine they'll be switching positions regularly, but it by no means leaves Mata in a consistent position.

&gt; Rooney enjoys occupying that space which the number 10 has a lot as he isn't a front line striker.

Arguably he was put there by Ferguson and although I can't prove my suspicion, I don't think he enjoys it as much as playing right at the front where he's in a scoring position much more frequently.

&gt; I believe we need a striker who can contest in the air.

He does this. Very well.

&gt; We need that striker who can really hassle opposing centre-backs and be strong when holding up the ball.

He does this better than most strikers in the PL.

There's quite a few factors for why we shouldn't sign Rooney but I don't believe these are any of them I'm afraid.

We currently have millions of families where both parents work, and we are paying for childcare, whilst at the same time we have millions of families where nobody works and we are paying them benefits. And how many families in each group are actually happy with it?

At this point in my life...I'm probably about the speed of Hudds.  Which is actually pretty good, considering he's an actual paid athelete.  But I'm not faster than that, so anywhere in the back 4 or on the wings is right out.

I'm OK at rec level striker...but I wouldn't score in the Prem.  Ever.  So striker is out too.

I could possibly play as one of three CMs...my vision and defense are good for an amateur, and I would have 2 other CMs to cover for the giant holes in my game.  This might work.

The last option is GK.  This might be the best situation.  Although my hands aren't fantastic (I tend to cough up more rebounds than I should), I can make some decent saves, and I have a good understanding of the game.  I would fit in well as a sweeper/keeper (I played Sweeper for 10+ years) in AVB's system.  My distribution would be adequate (I can still kick a ball ~60m on a goal kick...not impressive by Prem standards, but sufficient).  With a solid back 4 in front of me, I would only have an opportunity to completely embarrass myself a few times a game, and would probably hurt the team least there.

I think I was only surprised because of the idea that if you are going to regenerate (become new again), why would you regenerate old?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hey-ho! I will try and rush through some of your main points, I will however not tackle stuff like “he messed up Amy and Rory’s departure”, as that is basically a question of personal taste. I also would take The Power of Three over a Slitheen episode any day, it may not have a third act, but it has some great stuff with the Doctor and the Ponds. 

1. Predictable reveals. You have to remember that Moffat doesn’t just make this stuff up as he goes along. River being Amy’s daughter was a plot point he had already planned, when he gave her the name “Pond”, which means that the problem here is not “going for the safe solution” but rather dropping a few hints too many. People picked up on those hints and connected the dots. I however didn’t follow the online discussions at that time and was genuinely surprised by the reveal. However, if you already read about it a few times, you of course won’t be as impressed.

2. Overblown story arcs, hanging plot points. Well, I kind of give you that. The Moff has still some pretty big questions left to answer, but who knows, maybe he really will pull it off in the two upcoming specials. If he does, I’ll probably hail him as the greatest DW writer ever. If not, you’re right on that point. 
3.	No two-parters. As far as I understand, that’s partly a BBC publicity thing. It is a different approach to the series and I also don’t think it completely worked in season 7.2, mainly because most of the episodes weren’t quite special enough. But The Name of the Doctor is such a treat in its final form, I’m not sure if I want it to stretched out over two episodes. That said, I would probably think differently had it been a two-parter. 
4.	Too much River. She was in Angels Take Manhattan, because it was the departure episode of Amy and Rory. She had every right to be there. And this piece of dialogue makes me tear up every time: Amy: “The Angel, would it send me back to the same time, to him?” - The Doctor: “I don't know. Nobody knows.” - Amy: “But it's my best shot, yeah?” - The Doctor: “No!” - River: “Doctor, shut up! Yes, yes, it is!”
For that line alone, I will love River forever. She is sacrificing the chance of ever seeing her mother again, she accepts that the Doctor will suffer one of the greatest losses in his life and all for the vague chance, that her mother and her father might still be able to spend their lifes together. This is one of the most emotionally loaded scenes in Doctor Who ever.
5.	Companion mystery. You may have missed that the Clara mystery was FUCKING AWESOME. Funnily enough, a season ago people were complaining that Moffat would be putting the Doctor too much in the centre of the drama. Now a mystery arc concerning a new companion is suddenly overshadowing him? And for most of the series, Clara felt like the companion you wanted anyway, the mystery was luring in the background, but it was very rarely addressed in between the Moffat episodes. And Clara did want to see the universe. She wasn’t forced upon the Doctor.

true,whole_scottish_milk,null,null,"Tax is way too high in this country, for everyone. We always hear people saying we should tax the rich more or tax business more. That isn't the solution as it just makes economic growth very difficult. We need to tax everyone less, and instead look at how the government spends the tax. Billions are wasted every year on pointless endeavours by politicians so that they have something to do. The bedroom tax nonsense for example, they say it will save money to have people in the proper accomodation, without considering all the salaries and pensions that need to be paid out to the people organizing the re-housing and whatnot, also these people won't just be paid off when they are no longer needed, they will be kept in a job for life at the expense of the public even when they have no use whatsoever. 

They prop up inefficient businesses to give people jobs without putting any forethought into whether these investments can become self reliant, instead just bragging about how many job they managed to fill as if that is all that matters. Then we have all these governement agencies which may have started with good intentions but instead they have become larger than they ever needed to be while making it more difficult for people to conduct business. Trading standards for example, while it is good to have a governing body for general rules an regulations, trading standards has become a monster that will look for any way possible that they can close your business because to them it means they are doing their job.

Then we have local councils which are just awful in most cases. These councils restrict parking all over towns meaning people are more likely to go an spend their money at the huge supermarkets where there is free parking instead of promoting the local economy. They allow detrimental companies to conduct business in our towns like the payday loans and pawnshop franchises with ridiculous markups and interest rates. Then they charge us extortionate rates for council tax, and for what? To get our bins collected once per week and keep the streets relatively clean? Then they take the majority of that waste an stick it in the ground, instead of perhaps investing in some recycling equipment. It's not even that expensive, a granulator machine for plastics only costs a few thousand pounds. You could have an entire recycling plant set up for a few hundred thousand, which is nothing in the grand scale of things. Not only would this create jobs but we have goods to sell at the end which can be sold to China and the likes for their manufacturing industries (since ours is almost non-existant) meaning it can be self sufficient, or at the very least it would take some pressure off the taxpayer. Instead we have inefficient systems everywhere because policy is made by men in suits who have never spent a day in the real world and are only interested in their own pockets and the next election.

Government is spreading into every little aspect of our lives an trying to come up with ways to squeeze just a bit more money out of us then they brand us as criminals or lazy when we have nothing left to give them. The entire system is a joke. They would tax the air you breathe if they could.

true,Nowimnotalurker,flair-norwichcity,"Ruddy marvellous ","For anyone who wasnt watching the game, I'll do a cheeky review thing, because I managed to find a stream that didnt cut out every 5 minutes luckily enough:

We started out playing the same formation as last year, with bennett and snodgrass in the wings, fer and tettey as cdms, wes as a cam and hooper as the lone striker, and it was really effective - hooper had a few good chances and ionised them well.

Second half, as it's pre season I guess we tried to experiment: if my memory serves, we (along with a number of other changes) took Hoolahan off and replaced him with van wolfswinkel, playing a sort of 442. This really didn't work - in my opinion if you play a 442 both your center mids need to be pretty well rounded and be able to pass and create as well as tackle. While Fer looked up to it (he, along with hooper was probably ncfc motm), tettey really can't pass to save his life, and while that's fine when playing a CDM, it really showed in the second half. Braga dominated this bit.

After about 60 mins hooper went off and howson went on, reverting back to the old 4231, howson playing CAM, and I can't remember who was playing CDM but Fer did go off. It got a little better but RVW still seemed fairly isolated. The ball just wasn't getting through to him - for what it's worth I don't think howson quite has the creative spark to play that advanced playmaker role - I think he's much better as a sort of box to box midfielder (howson and fer playing CMs in a 442 could work methinks...), and braga continued to have the best of the play. You could really notice the lack of Wessi and Fer as our midfield started to get dominated a bit...

I am not entire sure if a) is such a great factor. This said, I never thought of the Doctor as someone I can identify with, because I always saw this as a part of the companion's role: Somebody we can identify with while we follow an alien through new worlds and great mysteries. So maybe there are people out there who can/try to identify themselves with the Doctor, but is the age in this case really relevant? All Doctors - or, better, all actors did portray the Doctor as an ancient being, sometimes cheerful and childish, but each one had a darker, more mature side. I never thought ""Oh, the Doctor looks about 30 but now he seems so much older than he is"", all I ever could think was ""Oh, the Doctor looks about 30 but nonetheless he *is* so much even if he acts like a child"". In my eyes, his appearance never was an indicator if I could identify myself with him - because, welp, I'm not 1000+ years old.

I think the bigger factor is b), that he is ""unattractive"" (even if I think Peter Capaldi looks very good for his age ... and is kinda handsome). Many people (oh, come on, what do I write here - I guess, I talk most of the time about the female part of the fandom here; there are for sure many male fans and I guess there are male voices in this complaint too, but ... I think women are more likely to say this) watch Doctor Who because the last three main actors were attractive. Sexy. Eye candy. Young. Like you said, somebody f.ckable in the minds of young (and older) woman, somebody you can have romantic adventures with and be flirty. And if you think that, that's okay. I also watch some movies/shows just because I think this one guy is really hot, but I would never dare to say I'm a fan of this show (like, HIMYM. I watch HIMYM because I'm only interested in Barney, and the rest is kinda boring. Not awful, but boring. I'm not a fan of HIMYM. I'm just a fan of Barney.). But if this particular character dies/vanishes from the surface of this show, I just stop watching. The end.
So ... and now we have the same problem I think for Doctor Who, only that it's a huge show with awesome writing and a big fanbase, and on the top of it, it's kinda cool now to watch that. So this fans like to watch the show, and they had eight years of eye candy in a *really cool show*, and now there is suddenly an old, grumpy man (that's exaggerated). Now they only have two choices: watch the show further and look at somebody they don't think is particular attractive to them, or stop it alltogether and miss out everything else (the fandom with all their friends, fanfiction, gifs, etc.), because the story and the idea behind Doctor Who is not interesting enough for them.

Well. Did that make sense? It's nearly 3:00am in my part of the world.

But yeah, I just want to say, ageism is a real, and such a great problem in our world (I don't know ad hoc any other science-fiction (or at least ""popular"") show where the main character is 50+) that it's kinda overflowing into the fictional world. Nobody ever talks about it, because our culture/world is so focused about the young, attractive, dandy people that they tend to forget that there are older people. Older people who have skills and wisdom and also can bring a new flow into old structures, but ...

... well ... they're not sexy enough.

I hope this comment wasn't entirely past the point of your topic. Thank you for mentioning this topic, though.

God, how I hope this casting decision finally separates the wheat from the chaff. I too think Matt Smith is sexy, and David Tennant also quite handsome, but I'm so tired of this people who only watched the show because ""OMG!!!

And the last time it left me a physical wreck that's essentially just a twisted parody of the person I used to be. I'm alive, but not ""me"" anymore.

All of our attacking players have something at their disposal that make them dangerous.. Coutinho with his ball control, passing vision and quickness.. Sturridge has pace, strength and can beat a player as well as link up well.. Even Aspas has shown against Olympiacos he has pace, good feet and a some flair be it with dummies or can turn defenders. Suraez speaks for himself, and then you have Ibe and Sterling with pace and trickery to blow.

I havn't seen Borini do anything like this, he may be a decent finisher and fairly quick but unless he gets the ball in space he looks lost for ideas. 

I hope it really is just match sharpness with the injuries he has had, im more than happy to be wrong if he hits the ground running with a full pre-season behind him.

true,justmots,present,"John Terry  ","I just have to say that I'm not against any of you guys but I personally feel that Mata is worth a lot more to us than he is to United.  With that being said, we have to understand that, yes they are being a bit sensible but at the same time from our perspective they are not because Rooney plays 2nd fiddle to Van Persie.  Mata does not play 2nd fiddle at all for us LOL, in fact he is quite the opposite, and we depend on him quite a lot at least these last couple of years.  You absolutely cannot deny Rooney's skill and diversity on the pitch.  I mean the guy can pretty much play anywhere and he hustles so much and gives it his all every game, which are absolutely great qualities in any player you want.  Rooney will drop back and help the defense a lot, as well as the offense, hell he'll even take free kicks with precision from almost anywhere as well.  He can even take PK's.  

So I think from a chelsea perspective or hell even just my own perspective that it is a little foolish for them to think Mata+15m is a fair trade for Rooney.  I would think that just Mata alone for Rooney would seem more sensible.  You cannot blame them for not understanding the importance of Mata to Chelsea during these last couple of years.  Mata gets along great with Torres, Azpilicueta and also with the rest of the team, but that brotherhood that these fellow Spaniards have helped them each have a smooth transition into the team.  Torres' game is much better when Mata is on the field than when he's not.  BUT that's just ME and maybe some others will agree. 

tl;dr- United doesn't understand the importance of Mata to Chelsea at this current time, so it's not crazy to think that Mata+15m would be an even deal to them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  I do think that some of the younger kids are disappointed to get a grandpa instead of a heartthrob.

I would pay good money to *not* have ""younger, sexier, edgier"".

But we can reprise the Amy &amp; Rory thing, with a couple of younger companions having exciting romantic relationship issues, if that's really necessary.

Also, 50 years ago (long before I was born) they had an actual literal grandpa - and kids still managed to enjoy the show. While there may be some bitching, I suspect that the vast majority of actual fans (regardless of age) will still be fans, and the ones who turned the sound off because they just wanted to look at Matt being sexy but didn't care about that science fiction stuff will find something else to watch.

&gt; I think I was only surprised because of the idea that if you are going to regenerate (become new again), why would you regenerate old?

Well, the actor isn't exactly expecting to die of old age next week. He's not *that* old. And I say that as someone at least 20 years younger than him.

And given that any specific regeneration can last for hundreds of years (subjective time) without substantial aging, then regenerating with the body of a guy in his 50's hardly seems like the worst possible option.

Now as for how FPL works, well there's a decent subreddit in r/fantasypl which is helpful but I can summarize a bit: 

- the game is scored based on points, your starting 11 players accumulate points based on goals, assists, clean sheets, and bonus points

- unlike American Fantasy Football, in which you have a draft-style league, any number of players can own a single player, for instance last season like 40% of players owned RVP

- points are subtracted for yellow cards, sending offs, penalty misses

- player values change on a weekly basis depending on their changes in ownership

- you get one free transfer a week, but you have to stay within your budget of initially 100m

- your team's value can increase if your player's value increases, however if you sell them to make a profit you only get 1/2 of the profit from that sale

- you get 2 'wildcards' throughout the season in which you can make unlimited transfers, one which you can make at any time and one only during the month of january

I've been playing fpl for years and years, did pretty well last year. In general you should aim for 2000 points over the full season. Feel free to ask me anything that you need help with. 

The game is most fun when played against a few mates, I would recommend asking around to see if your footy-interested friends have a minileague, because the friendly competition makes it worth playing.

true,JTHB,mcgann,McGann,"As you rightly mentioned Who has a well documented history of this. In the new series we've has actresses such as Agyeman and Gillan appear fleetingly before going on to take major roles in show, but there are even more examples in classic Who. In the very early days of the show the supporting cast was constantly recycled with actors showing up in multiple stories per series. Even when it's to this extent I can't say seeing the same actor reused bothers me in the slightest. What this proves I believe is that it comes down to the character. If you have a talented performer who can successfully convey the different personality, physical traits and emotions of that certain role it shouldn't be any effort to see past their face. There's a reason why the Doctor ultimately always feels like the Doctor regardless of his appearance. I think it's safe to say a man as skilled at his craft as Capaldi won't show any similarities between the desperate, deranged Frobisher and the Doctor. 

If anything I would expect people to find more problem with Capaldi's role in The Fires of Pompeii than in Torchwood, there he interacted directly with the Doctor. But there's already conclusive proof that all of this doesn't have much impact, Colin Baker, the 6th Doctor. He starred opposite Peter Davison's 5th Doctor in Arc of Infinity, where he even attempted to kill the Doctor! Did this affect anyone's enjoyment of his portrayal of the Doctor? I highly doubt it. I don't feel an explanation is necessary, in the two examples you gave, Agyeman and Myles, it was a nice touch but by no means essential. They were also reasonably realistic explanations, trying to tie this together would be a much more strenuous connection. 

I'm confident Capaldi shall make a wonderful job of this and that his previous appearances won't tarnish the enjoyment one ounce for any reasonable viewer.",0,1375756421,null,0,false,0,cbhscd1,t3_1js75c,t1_cbhscd1,t3_1js75c,null,1429931381,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

You can't predict how the future will be. Esp in the EPL. Right now the best decision is to pass on Rooney, give Lukaku the time and experience he needs and use the talent we have. And mind you, we have a great amount of talent and depth this year going into the season (finally).

I wouldn't be disappointed if we signed Rooney. He's a top class player. But he'll only be taking away from Lukaku, who in my opinion, is the smarter choice to build the future of this team around. That combination of physicality and talent doesn't come around every generation (kind of like Dwight Howard being a ""once-in-a-generation centre"").

He was massive last year for West Ham (7th in tackles per Game) and in January his release clause was something like 3.5m, not sure if it still is at that level but he would be a younger cheaper option to Parker.

I get the feeling that BAE is on his way out, even when healthy last year it seemed like AVB didn't fully trust him.  At 29 he is also hitting the age where we would look to cash in on what value he has if someone makes an offer.  I agree that we can wait until January if we keep Rose and BAE, but i think we may be in the market for one now.

I think we are fine if we have 3 strikers, my concern is that we may move either JD or Ade.  We could use a younger option at as a 2/3 striker and seeing as we are rapidly approaching the season start i am not sure who would be availible that we could get without breaking the bank.

I think right now though the number 1 concern is CB.  Currently we have Kaboul and Dawson who have a history of injuries (and it sounds like Daws is nicked up now and Kaboul is recovering) and Jan who is nicked up.  the season is far too long to carry only 3 CB's especially when every year we have a situation where multiple CBs are hurt.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I think that the Jesus parallels are a relatively new phenomenon in Doctor Who, really only bubbling to the surface when Russel T. Davies (perhaps not-so coincidentally, the mind behind *Second Coming*) took the reigns.

RTD's run likens the Doctor to a ""lonely god"" and a ""martyr"". *The Last of the Time Lords* really digs it's heels in with the allusions, what with the Master scoffing at the Doctor's plan with a very specific:

&gt; MASTER: Nothing will happen. Is that your weapon? Prayer? 

Followed by the Doctor's (frankly hamfisted) reveal of what the Master is horrified that the Doctor is going to say:

&gt; DOCTOR: I forgive you. 


All of these elements of the Doctor being semi-messianic aside, the show has been, on the whole, quite delicate with the nature of religion, never taking a controversial stance. That having been said, the show leans *ever* so slightly towards a negative portrayal of religion, particularly in Moffat's run.

To give a proper run-down:

1. In *The Unquiet Dead* we have Dickens' rationalist mindset that seeks to explain away the inexplicable as trickery clashes with the sudden appearance of ""ghosts"". The Doctor explains in a relatively secular manner:  
&gt; DICKENS: Stop it. Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong?   
&gt; DOCTOR: Not wrong. There's just more to learn

   It's also important to note that this is the first episode where we see the Doctor rejecting religious beliefs in favor of pragmatism and helping the living:  
&gt; ROSE: But we can't [let the Gelth take bodies].  
DOCTOR: Why not?   
ROSE: It's not- I mean, it's not...   
DOCTOR: Not decent? Not polite? It could save their lives.  

1. In *Parting of the Ways* we see that the Daleks have developed a concept of blasphemy and an overall religious slant with the Dalek Emperor acting as their unholy idol.

2. In *Gridlock* we hear the radio apologetically broadcasting the ""daily contemplation"" of *""The Old Rugged Cross""* out to the trapped inhabitants of New New York's titanic freeway, acting as both an apology and opiate of false hope to those helplessly inching forward towards an empty goal.

3. *The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit* we see a decidedly more religious plot, with the Doctor facing what is essentially Satan. The issue of whether the Doctor believes in any particular religion is skirted very carefully, resting the Doctor's incredulity on scientific matters (i.e. can things have existed from before the universe) rather than spiritual:
&gt; IDA: What about you? [Do you have a faith?]   
DOCTOR: I believe, I believe I haven't seen everything, I don't know. It's funny, isn't it? The things you make up. The rules. If that thing had said it came from beyond the universe, I'd believe it, but before the universe? Impossible. Doesn't fit my rule. Still, that's why I keep travelling. To be proved wrong. Thank you, Ida. 

4.  *Army of Ghosts* has the Doctor once again meeting the (apparent) supernatural. We also see his response to the concept of life-after-death as he's being chided by Jackie for acting so rationalistic all the time:  
&gt; JACKIE: You're always doing this. Reducing it to science. Why can't it be real? Just think of it, though. All the people we've lost. Our families coming back home. Don't you think it's beautiful?   
DOCTOR: I think it's horrific. 

5. In *The Fires of Pompeii* we have an order of prophets acting as servants to the Pyroviles. This is more normal psuedo-historical revisionism so I don't take it too much to heart, but it does portray a religion both as bad (the order of the seers) and benign (if not slightly mislead in the form of the ""house gods"").

This is just what's present in RTD's era, and the many elements you mention in your article go a great length to show that positive parallels are connected to the Doctor as well, heralding him as a god-like force of selflessness and good. Many times he's explicitly offered his life for the good of humanity against the forces of evil, and obviously this leads to parallels with other famous saviors.

However, the religious parallels go into overdrive under Moffat's rule. 

1. The first real introduction to religion in Moffat's Who is immediate: As a bit of a childish gag (and perhaps a tactic to not play favorites) we find Young Amelia praying to Santa for someone to fix a crack in her wall.

2. This only comes up again in *The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone* where we're introduced to the Anglican Marines. A generic hodge-podge that leans towards Catholic, this church is (perhaps comedically) militaristic. This becomes all the more contrasted when they join with the Silence in *A Good Man Goes to War* to destroy the Doctor.

3. This brings me to the Silence themselves. Described as a ""religious order"" they act as Series Six's central villains. Their vendetta against the Doctor is described as religiously motivated. They essentially act as the primary representation of religion in Doctor Who, which is only worsened when you couple them with...

4. The Headless Monks. Again, we have a religious order portrayed as the bad guys. With the growing Doctor vs. Religion dichotomy of Series Six, it's hard not to see that as a more universal message: That the Doctor, ever the scientist and explorer, is fighting against organized religion.

5. But to bring it back to episode-by-episode analysis you've got *The God Complex*, one of the few Doctor Who episodes that tackle the nature of fate head-on. We see the Doctor deal with the issue of Amy viewing him like a god and Rory gets outed as either an atheist or agnostic. The overall message of this episode seems to be ""don't make idols"", and while that treads a bit on religion, as one person's idol *was religion*, it's general enough not to be pointing fingers.

I could go on but I think I'd be boring you to tears to go into the more murky aspects of the Doctor's exploration of the concept of destiny and the universe having a purpose that he's confronted with through Clara.

That could not be further from the truth. Stateside the show attracts science fiction fans and the ""geek/nerd"" demographics. These are the two primary groups. In the states Doctor Who is still a niche product and it's impact is still very small compare to the rest of Europe. The vocal minority that resides in the states, which is typically comprised of young girls aged 11-16, is a very small percentage of the shows viewer base. The only reason it doesn't look that way is because the amount of time the spend online shipping and gushing over everything, screaming and yelling. You also need to factor in that world wide market is far different from the US, in social norms and economical. It's noted that Doctor Who makes most of it's non-European bank off merchandise...which again is still not a primary source for the shows budget and funding.

I'm really not downplaying your research but as an economist you'll know that it's possible for a number of different conclusions to be drawn from a set of data. We see it almost every day in politics when policies are announced.
