true,executivemonkey,null,null,"There are only three rules that you need to know for London.

1. Don't delay people, especially not in a tube station.  You will hear the most vicious swearing if you do.  Don't walk slowly or suddenly stop in front of people.

2. Don't talk to strangers on public transport.  If you are traveling with people you know, keep your conversation from bleeding over into other people's ear-space.

3. If people are waiting for something, there will be a queue.  Find where it ends and take your place.  Americans are generally used to this practice, but the British queue a bit differently.  For example, Brits form one long queue at supermarket tills.  They don't form separate lines for each till.  The only exception is when you're getting on trains.  The rule in that situation is to let people get off the train before you get on, but you don't have to figure out who was waiting for the train first and go behind him.

Other things, like tipping differences, aren't really important.  Brits don't  tip in as many situations as Americans, but they won't turn down a tip or take offense if you offer one.  Despite their attitude on Reddit, they don't really care that you use different words or have an accent.  In my experience, they will be very impressed if you know about British politics and British culture, so read about it before going over there.  They will also want to talk about America, especially how short American vacations are, Obama, and US health care.  They will have no interest in talking about gun culture and will become uncomfortable if you mention it.  They like telling people about their health and safety rules.  Be careful about discussing immigration, as that is a politically-charged issue over there.

However most wages in the public sector, unless you're HIGHLY important, are capped. For instance for most intelligence analysts in MI5 the most they could hope to earn would be around £45,000.

On HL go for the subsidised funds from the wealth list that dont take an entry fee and ETFs which they actually do very well. they trade like stocks so you pay commission and stamp duty. buy and sell in larger amounts, ideally over £2000 to keep the purchasing costs under a percent.

I expect the issue arises when sportsmen/women who hold citizenship yet are blatantly not British nor try to be are found competing under the Union flag.

I'm going to use a few cricket examples as they tend to be the most egregious, but Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott are both South Africans, and even though KP likes to put on a British 'front', they both (Trott especially, who doesn't even pretend) privately see themselves as South Africans. Eoin Morgan is an even worse offender - he's Irish through and through and would never claim to be British. 

The common denominator is that each of them merely came to the UK for the sole reason of playing international cricket for them, either because they couldn't get into their own team (in Trott and KP's case), or because they were good enough for England. Their own idea of 'national identity' didn't factor into it.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Firstly, the article doesn't mention Germany. It isn't about comparing with other countries, it's about looking at the figures within our own economy. 

Secondly, the reason people care about this issue is because it is affecting their everyday lives. Disposable income for those in work is falling because the cost of living is rising faster than wages, it's as simple as that. The economy is growing but normal families are not benefitting and will not benefit for quite some time because the growth is down to the squeeze on wages. The Tories are shoveling this 'economic growth is improving living standards for all' bullshit down our throats when it is completely false. Cutting taxes in a year or two when the economy is growing won't be enough to offset the loss in real pay over the course of the ~~double~~ triple dip recession, not by a long shot (And that's excluding the economic impact to these families of public sector cuts).

Unemployment should be falling faster. New jobs in the private sector are still being offset by massive cuts in both the private and public sector. Further cuts were made necessary when George Osbourne cut the top rate of tax, as a cut in tax is a cut in revenue in the short-medium term. He said this will encourage economic growth, but it's evident that there is a disconnect between economic growth and living standards from this article. Furthermore, those cuts impacted the poorest people the most. Welfare reforms for those in work, cuts in council services, public transport and cuts in other services that the poor rely on have been made in order to improve economic growth, which won't benefit them because their wages won't increase.

true,Limited_By_Anxiety,null,null,"This is a complicated issue that is less about shutting hospitals than running safe hospitals. 

I know that the present government would very much like to shut hospitals and centralise services in order to reduce tax but we have a problem in many parts of the country that is leading to the closure of hospitals and that is the lack of suitably qualified consultants. 
My local hospital, the Alex in Redditch,  is under threat of closure (or being taken over and downgraded by a neighbouring hospital trust) and I have been part of the consultation process over this.  As part of that process I attended a consultation with senior doctors from my health care trust, within my area we have two large hospitals (Worcester and Redditch) and one more that has been under threat for decades (Kidderminster). This problem is that we haven't sufficient consultants to safely cover all three hospitals, the fact is we only have sufficient consultants to cover one.

This lack of senior staff has already been a contributing factor in the death of a young man, a consultant that had worked a very long week (exceeding the number of hours that she should have worked) did not consider that her attendance was required when called in the early hours of a Sunday morning, no other paediatric consultant was employed by the trust at the time and when the consultant arrived at 8 am it was too late to save the young man. 

Hospital closures are a big issue for people, Kidderminster even elected their MP on the issue of keeping their hospital open. And within the next election this will be the issue that people will talk about. If the Alex is taken over by the neighbouring trust the loss of patents will mean that services in the Worcester hospital will lose so many patents that they will be financially infeasible ( principally radiography). The loss of these key departments will have a knock on effect on the sort of medical procedure that can be preformed, thus many cancer and bowel surgeries will no longer be treated within the county. And if these surgeries go then we will also lose the consultants that run those services.

To run one hospital safely within Worcestershire requires 24 consultants, presently we have 18 covering three hospitals.  That is the biggest issue to me, safe health care! Not if you have a local hospital. I know people do not like this but that is where we are. People expect to have access to the latest technology and high quality correctly staffed 25/7 health care, that is only possible if we centralise services, not due to cost but due to the lack of suitably qualified staff members. 

The reasons for the lack of consultants are not that complicated, most medical schools are female dominated and many women like to have children and raise them (as they have every right to do), becoming a consultant is also a long and hard process that not every one can achieve and the overwhelming documentation that now is an integral part of health care takes doctors away from the activities that made them become doctors in the first place. 

Their is no simple fix to this problem, the numbers of places in medical schools are dropping and the number of female undergraduate are rising. To train a consultant takes decades and presently we have a health service that is unsafe at times. 

So although I dislike the thought of having the nearest A&amp;E so far away that getting to it in an emergency will take three times as long I want safe care more. ",0,1382006568,null,0,false,0,ccthy41,t3_1omt92,t1_ccthy41,t3_1omt92,null,1429100715,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

They've increased minimum wage a few times. Not by a huge amount, but probably as much as they can without mass protest from employers.

They've increased the tax free allowance so millions of the lowest earners pay no income tax at all.

Low earners even get their wages topped up by the government too.

IMO, I don't think this is the result of any specific governments' policies (either this government or the last, or even the one before that). I think it was the eventual way that the country is heading. In an international world, we can't have lots of well paid unskilled jobs any more because we compete against everybody - both foreign countries which can do it cheaper, and also foreign workers in the UK who are willing to work for less, live like students and send the money back home. That's a lot cheaper than a British person wanting to live here and raise a family.

I'm not sure what the answer is. A hike in minimum wage would surely just increase the prices at your restaurants, local shops etc who all employ lots of minimum wage workers? And the increased prices wouldn't really make anybody better off.

&gt;The HVDC Cross-Channel (French: Interconnexion France Angleterre) is the name given to two different high voltage direct current (HVDC) connections that operate or have operated under the English Channel between the continental European and British electricity grids.

 - Lose employment taxes.  Why on earth do we have employer's national insurance?  That's 13.8% hidden away on every employment.  Without this employers could (a) give pay rises or (b) employ more people.
 - Get VAT back at its EU-mandated minimum.  VAT is a consumption tax, and that hurts the poorest more than any other group.  It should be 0% ideally; but 15% is the minimum the EU require.  It's also a tax that puts companies out of business as it's a tax on value-added by them rather than profit.  At least you have to make profit before you pay corporation tax.  More businesses equals more demand for employees equals higher wages.

The lowered revenues can be replaced with (a) more GDP because we'd have a better economy (b) land value taxes (ducks) to get some money from the big expensive properties in London.

The definition of poverty the government was using for a single person with two children to have £186 a week after all expenses - gas, electricity, water, council tax, tax, NI, rent (excluding food). (I believe the report found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251213/State_of_the_Nation_2013.pdf) uses the same definition. The BBC article is misleading in saying that people only need to earn £7.50 to not be considered 'in poverty') So to be considered not in relative poverty a single person needs to have an income somewhere in the region of 20-25k...

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Lower personal taxes. Why is someone on the minimum wage paying taxes?

full time minimum wage: ~£15,400/yr

Income tax allowance: £9440

Lowest bracket(10%): £2790   [£12230 accounted for] &amp; £279 due in tax

basic bracket(20%): £3170  [£15400 accounted for] &amp; £634 due in tax

So your total income tax bill is £913. You get £14,500/yr to live off, and still qualify for housing benefit of up to £13,000 a year. You aren't making a net payment to the taxman if you actually use what you're given, only if you ignore any help offered to recoup living costs. If you earn under £12230 you only pay £280 in tax, and if you earn under £9500 your income is tax free.

e: as someone pointed out, the low bracket only counts for money put into savings, and if you don't save anything it's not relevant. Your total taxable income on minimum wage makes up 9.5% of what you earn, and the goverment (assuming they cover half of your rent and you pay the average amount per month in rent) will give you 38.9% of your gross income back. Why are people acting like minimum wage isn't set to factor in tax costs?

As for the idea of losing employment tax, that's kinda hilarious. Where will the money come from if you remove employment tax? either a) employers through tax on transactions, reducing business again and removing all those jobs you just created, or b) on employees, putting a whole lot more people below a comfortable income in the interests of business.

[Here's](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/fracking-study-pennsylvania_n_4030748.html) another. 

You'll also note, from the articles you cite, the lack of any public consultation. 

You may also notice telling quotes along these lines: 

""The Treasury is consulting on fiscal measures to incentivise shale activity"" 

""To date companies have sourced water for shale fracturing from the local water utility company. "" 

So neither ""all the information available"", nor - to many - information from an entirely trustworthy source, given the language. This government's already invested in this process. They're relying on it to bail them out of a medium-term energy problem. Yet the only place in which widespread testing has taken place is in the US, and you don't have to look far to find empirical evidence of problems. And this is in a country an order of magnitude larger than ours. We have a far smaller water table: contamination would be proportionally more serious.

http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx

It's nothing like a US clinic.  (I'm American). One doctor's office looked like it was in a former pre-school, another an old house, it's all dependent.  You check in with the front desk person, they tell you where to go and wait, and you sit in the waiting area.  No one calls you back, at least not in my experience.  Either they will have a bell, light, or in my case a scrolling text board with last name, so you know the doctor is ready to see you.  

You go into their office.  They usually sit behind a desk and you will have a seat and discuss why you are visiting.   It's kind of weird to an American's sensibilities but I found the novelty in it.  

Due to being on the NHS, all your records are right there on their computer screen.  Very useful imho.  Any meds that I needed, they would give me a script and I either went to the local Tesco for filling or Boots.  I don't know how much scripts are now, but for 6 months of one of my meds, I paid 6.90pounds.  Birth control was free.  Cocodomol - (small amount of codeine and paracetamol) was over the counter and super cheap.

Start small and focus on issues you find interesting rather than the big stories occupying the other papers. You'll put more effort in that way and give people something a bit different to focus on. It will take a while to meet and aquire sources, and obviously to gain readers, but as long as it's semi regulary updated and you advertise it well you should have as good a chance as anyone.

However, I'd say advertising is one of the biggest problems when it comes to media, and I dont just mean in terms of getting yourself out there, but how it is used to fund most of the journalism / stories we see. It's easy like you said to view a majority of the press as stupid in the way they operate and things they put out, but they are mostly all commercial enterprises and need advertising revenue to survive. The way they do this is by focusing stories at certain demographics, then sell those demographics to the advertisers. This in my opinion does make a lot of them suspect, because if their main motervation is selling you to advertisers, then how can you really trust what they say? This obviously won't be a factor in the short term as it will just be a labor of love to start out with, but it's something to consider for the future if you are serious.

I'd rather see the cost of living to go down rather than increase earnings. The problem with the attitude of constantly increasing wages is that prices rise accordingly. You cannot win.

Things had a value even 25 years ago, whereas these days, the value has become totally lost on many. I mean, kids want the latest iPhone, and though I can tolerate (hardly) the idea that owning a phone at 15 has become a right, it's totally crazy to consider we can't educate them anymore that £500 is a LOT of money.

Reduce the costs of living, bring the value back so that people can relate to them.

On top of which, while I understand your frustration with modern journalism, there are certain skills you need in order to make a go of it. Can you write shorthand, for example? Because if you can't you'll have to record all your interviews and spend hours listening back typing them up. And how aware are you of the laws governing reporting? Because if you publish something that's in contempt of court, or is liableous you could end up with a hefty fine or even a prison sentence. And just how good are your writing skills? I noticed you used the passive voice in your first sentence, and didn't capitalise the Freedom of Information Act. Neither of these are a problem in a Reddit post, but would get you shouted at by a newspaper editor, and for good reason, as they are examples of sloppy writing which will eventually distract the reader. And I'm assuming you don't know how much time it takes to make FoI requests, nor how long it takes to read and decipher what you have - it's not a quick process, which is precisely why most journalists prefer to just re-write press releases instead.

Sorry for the rant, but I do get frustrated when people assume it's easy being a journalist. It's not. To work on any newspaper in this country you need to pass the NCTJ exams, and they have a failure rate close to 50 per cent. I know there's a lot of shit journalism out there, but that's because it's an arduous industry to do well in... and we do still have some of the best in the business in this country.

Anyway, best of luck. If you want my advice, just get onto every press-release mailing list you can and re-write them.

true,StormySan,flare-brum,St Pauls,"Unfortunately Uni teaching of PHP is either useless of non-existant from my experiences :(

Bread-and-butter PHP devs, in my opinion, would need experience of Frameworks (like Zend or Symphony) - specifically knowledge of MVC; Unit Tests (like phpUnit and Selenium); some knowledge of Linux (ie: being given a linux box and being able to setup a webserver with it), being able to set up their development environment (ie: Being given a laptop and setting Apache et al on it with whatever flavour GUI you use), and coding to PSR-2 or Zend standards.

Good work on building your own game :) It's something most software devs always talk about doing but never get around to completing! The problem though is that developers need to be able to write maintainable code that other devs can pick up and modify easily. And most teenager code is the opposite of that (Christ, I shudder at the kind of stuff I used to produce :/ )

There are definitely junior roles out there if that's what you're after, but to be honest if you can knock up a demo site using something like Zend, with phpunit tests, that is written to Zend code standards and does something more than the standard CRUD methods then you could happily package it up and use it as an example of your work. Most places will require code examples as part of your application process.

I'd absolutely recommend attending some of the PHP conferences each year which are excellent for gaining skills and are always full of people trying to recruit developers. Also some events like [php northwest](https://joind.in/event/phpnw13) publish slides online and, once they're finished touching them up, put videos of each talk up as well. Browse back to phpnw12 or 11 and you'll have some great resources for the kind of things you need to be looking at.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"First: you're still paying tax.  So what's wrong with my point?

Second: the 10% rate is for interest on savings; so is completely irrelevant.

The truth:

    15400 - 9440 = 5960
    5960 * 0.2 = 1192

Then you've missed off NI...primary threshold is 149 per week or 7748 per year above this, NI is 12%.

    15400 - 7748 = 7652
    7652 * 0.12 = 918.24

Summing;

   1192 + 918.24 = 2110.24

More than 2000 in tax for someone who is earning minimum wage just doesn't seem right.  Personally I'm not in favour of the minimum wage, as it take choice away from people.  However, surely if that's the number the government have picked then they think those people are, by definition, at the bottom of the earning scale.  Why then are they paying tax?  Why are we wasting time and money by taking taxes off these people only to give it them back via benefits?

Take a look at the income distribution.  The taxes we get from low earners make up the tiniest proportion of tax revenues.  Why bother?

Finally, the employer has to pay 13.8% of the entire salary as employers national insurance.  That's £2125 that is, from their point of view, an additional cost of the employee.  While the employee doesn't see it on their pay cheque -- they are paying it in the form of lower wages.  We should at least have the decency to show people what they're paying.  If we told the truth it would be:

 - Gross earnings: 15400 + 2125 = 17525
 - Income tax = 1192
 - National insurance = 918.24 + 2125

Further, why do they distinguish between income tax and national insurance?  These days, they all go in the same tax pot.  There's no insurance.

The person on minimum wage is therefore earning 17525 per anum and paying 4235.24 in tax.  Or 25% of their income.  On _minimum wage_.

But obviously it's the evil employers who's fault it is that work doesn't pay.  Government has nothing to do with it. /s

They're valuable only because they can be exchanged for value in the UK.

Even if that weren't the case.  Why would we care?  It's a bit of paper, not a nuclear power station.  Money is only valuable because it can be exchanged for things of value.  It is not, in itself, worth anything.

Let's think of an extreme example (although if you read up about QE you'll notice it's not that extreme).  The UK government buys a nuclear power stations for 10 billion pounds.  The chinese give us a power station, which is real and generates power.  After they've done that, the UK government prints 10 times more money and issues it to everyone in the UK.  You just show your current holdings and the government adds a zero.  Not for the Chinese though.  They're now holding bits of paper worth a tenth of what they were, but we're still holding the same power station.

Historically however, the Chinese have taken their pounds and lent them back to us.  They buy government bonds with them.  Government bonds being... other bits of paper with different numbers on.

I don't claim to understand why the Chinese would _want_ to do this, but it's certainly not bad for the UK.

true,[deleted],null,null,"first off, as someone else pointed out my number for minimum wage earnings is too high. a 40 hr week at £6.31/hr gives a gross annual income of £13124- I was assuming over 40 hours.

&gt;First: you're still paying tax. So what's wrong with my point?

your point is simplistic and it doesn't make sense. why does someone living alone in a one bed flat deserve just as much back as a single parent with kids in a 4 bed home? Are dependents and circumstances just not relevant in your mind?

&gt;Second: the 10% rate is for interest on savings; so is completely irrelevant.

So you're making £13000 a year. Half your rent is covered by the council, saving you on average of £5100 a year. And yet, you aren't putting a penny in savings? Gee, I have so much sympathy for you.

Assuming you're irresponsible with money but still want the taxpayer to give you everything, let's say your income is just taxes at the 20% rate. That's £736 in income tax. Net income at this point: £17,360. 

As you work a 40 hour week, you fall in the lower income NI bracket, and 12% of your income **over £149**- £645 in total. Net income at this point: £16715. Still £3500 more than your gross income.

The fact you pay tax is **accounted for** in housing benefit payments. The reason the government will pay for part of your accomodation, even though you have a job, is that they realise that after tax, your income is going to be low. They want to give you a chance to put money into savings and to encourage that, they tax it at **half** the normal rate. If you were to use your maximum taxable amount, you would pay a total of £1100 to the government in exchange for £5100. What do you think is unfair about this?

You are taxed at just over **10.5%**, not 25%. You are then given **38.9%** of your income back. NI payments are calculated based upon your income over a basic amount- they don't kick in at 12% the moment you cross that amount. which means on *minimum wage* the government gives you significantly more money than you give it. *4 times* the amount.  

In case anyone else wants to check these numbers, after I did this I googled it and found[ this calculator](http://www.listentotaxman.com/index.php) that gives me the same result.

It's pretty standard understanding that if you subsidise something you get more of it; if you tax it, you get less of it.  Employment taxes result in less employment.  You're going to have to provide some strong evidence to refute that fairly fundamental principle.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; In recent years I've taken more and more interest in the media in this country and I can't help think it is genuinely a sad state of affairs with misinformation and half arsed journalism all over the shop.

If you combed through a daily newspaper I'd imagine that in excess of 90% of the facts cited were true. There's plenty of examples of half arsed journalism but most of the problems people have come with slant and bias, which ultimately cannot be eliminated. The very act of gathering news is biased within itself, based on numerous value judgements as to what is worth reporting. Added to that, all news sources function as entertainment, with all the pressure that brings. Even the BBC has to keep viewing figures to justify its existence.

I'm not sure I'd start him for this match as I think it's more important to make sure he's fully fit for Arsenal, better to ease him in.  Newcastle also have lots of pace to exploit the little pockets of space we leave between our wingbacks and CBs with Remy and Ben Arfa which is dangerous.  I do still think we'll see the 3-5-2 this weekend though, and I think the starting players won't be different with the exception of Agger coming in for Skrtel:

-------------------Mignolet--------------------

----------Toure---Sakho---Agger----------

Henderson--Gerrard--Lucas--Enrique

---------------------Moses---------------------

------------Suarez-----Sturridge------------

Subs: Jones, Skrtel, Cissoko, Johnson, Allen, Sterling, Aspas

As much as I'd love to see Coutinho get some minutes as a sub this weekend I think he really needs to be protected for the Arsenal match and rushing him back into service could be very bad.  I'd expect to see Allen come on for Gerrard at some point with Johnson making an appearance as well.  Lucas tends to travel well so I'm expecting to see him start the match but if he's fatigued or something then I wouldn't be surprised to see Allen slot in for him.  I'd love to see us comfortably ahead so that we can give Aspas a run out and give Sturridge a bit of a break.  He put in a really good shift for England this past week and I don't want to see him pick up a silly injury that keeps him out of the Arsenal match in 2 weeks.

I think statements about ""the taxpayer subsidising"" show such a poor understanding of the nature of society, that it's not worth answering.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted for making such a dismissive answer, but it's 
inevitable that people will disagree on political policies, if they cannot first agree on things like the rights of man and the purpose of government.

I'm really glad you're the exception to the rule, but social mobility has only fallen in the last two or three decades, and wealth inequality has risen over this period since the Thatcherist narrative of ""why should the state pay?"" and ""families should better themselves"" has taken hold.

Falling social mobility and rising wealth inequality are not my opinions, by the way, they are provable and measurable.

Finally, we're always going to need people to fill ""urban, non-skilled job[s]"" - I could start a manufacturing business tomorrow, I'll need to employ assemblers, packagers and janitors, at the very least. I doubt that you are some kind of exception who doesn't use supermarkets, so you'll always need people to unload the delivery lorries and stack the shelves.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; your point is simplistic and it doesn't make sense. why does someone living alone in a one bed flat deserve just as much back as a single parent with kids in a 4 bed home? Are dependents and circumstances just not relevant in your mind?

We're talking about taxation, not about benefits.  Tax rates are independent of circumstance, they are defined entirely by your gross. Minimum wage is independent of circumstance.  Benefits should not be.  My suggestion was to raise the tax allowance -- I don't see what that has to do with benefits.

If you want to give different people different benefits -- fine, do it with the benefits system.  However, there is no sanity at all to taxing people who you, by definition, think are earning the least it is possible to earn.

&gt; So you're making £13000 a year. Half your rent is covered by the council, saving you on average of £5100 a year. And yet, you aren't putting a penny in savings? Gee, I have so much sympathy for you.

I don't think you've understood the 10% rate.  It's the rate on savings interest. Not the rate you pay on income you save.  I'm assuming zero or negligible savings for a minimum wage earner.  I don't think that's unreasonable.  If it's not the case then the minimum wage is too high.

Again though you've made it seem that every single person on minimum wage is in the same circumstances, with half their rent paid by the council.  That simply isn't the case.  It's also nothing to do with tax rates.  If you want to adjust benefits, adjust benefits, don't do it by making some convoluted system where you tax then give it back.  It would be simpler to get what you appear to want (and I don't object to what you want) by raising the tax allowance to bring minimum earners out of tax and then lowering benefits.

I'm not going to bother with the rest of your comment, since you've assumed that everyone on minimum wage gets 5100 a year in housing benefits.  Which is (1) nothing to do with my point  (2) completely incorrect.

Tax rates apply to everyone, benefits don't.  Want to sort out benefits?  Fine, I'm on board with that.  It's a different subject though.

---

Rerun of numbers using 13124 (and treating employer's NI as if the
employee paid it, which they effectively do)...

    Cost to employer       : 13124 * 1.138 = 14935.112
    Gross pay from payslip : 13124
    Income tax             : (13124-9440)*0.2 = 736.8
    NI                     : 645.12 + 1811.112 = 2456.232
    Total tax              : 3192.03

That's 3193.03 in tax on 14935 income.  Or 21.3%.

With that in mind, why is anyone surprised that we have such desperate need for benefits?  Stop taking the lowest earners money off them and vast quantities of them won't need benefits.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"&gt;As for club name, they did it with clubs from Salzburg and New York, do you relly believe they could just come and change name of one of the biggest and most known teams in the world? They can't, it would be scoring hat-trick of owngoals.

Why not? Can you *imagine* the press that changing Liverpool's name would generate? It would be news everywhere. Granted, a lot of that news would be about how Liverpool fans are upset, but guess what: *RedBull doesn't give a fuck about Liverpool fans.* For Red Bull it'd just be a way to get its brand written up all over the world. 

After that, sure, it wouldn't be the Liverpool we all know and love, but again, Red Bull doesn't care. Liverpool is indeed a huge brand, but it *isn't Red Bull*, and that's all Red Bull cares about. Assuming they're capable of buying their way into the CL, there is no reason for the company to give a shit about much else; what they want is *their* name and logo being mentioned in CL broadcasts as much as possible. If it's *Liverpool's* name and logo that are getting the airtime, that doesn't help them. 

As the article makes pretty clear, they don't give a flying fuck about any team's ""brand""; they're just looking for any English team it wouldn't be too hard to lift into the Champions League. If they buy Liverpool, it's not going to be out of any interest in, or respect for, Liverpool Football Club and what it stands for. It's just a way for them to fill in a blank in their marketing strategy:

1. Buy and rebrand ***[insert English club here; London-based is best but any good club will do]***
2. Buy a few players, take them to Champions League
3. Sell more energy drinks

edit: to be clear, I don't think this will happen as I doubt FSG would sell to them, and I'd guess they'll end up going for some London-based Championship team (Red Bull Rangers, anyone?).

So we could easily kick up the Nuclear share another 10% at least with no worries in terms of load tracking. Thats another 35TWh we could be producing per year from Nuclear easily.

You're right. My bad.

True, but given that the Scottish government currently receives a block grant from Westminster, which presumably includes a portion of the Crown profits, it's not particularly relevant.

&gt;especially after a large number of SIGNIFICANT businesses relocate their head offices back into the UK, causing a massive unemployment spike (big picture)

Sheer speculation. Especially if rUK leaves the EU and Scotland stays in.

&gt;Then consider the contest from the UK over Scottish oil and gas as the UK paid a large proportion of the costs of exploration and would demand a slice of the £22b a year pie it already paid for.

If the UK government seriously thought it could contest the geographical division of North Sea oil and gas, why haven't they said anything to that effect? And, if we're going down that road, what about all the publicly owned assets in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Why wouldn't Scottish taxpayers be entitled to a share of that? I think you'll find these are things to be negotiated in the interim period between the referendum and the actual separation.

&gt;All in all, an independent Scotland would rely on income from the Crown, so keeping the monarchy would be a requirement, despite the INTERNAL policies of the SNP

one of the problems we face is that we're in one of the most comfortable countries in the world. your manufacturing business would be receiving applications from economic migrants of all kinds and creeds(myself included, i'm from near belfast) who have moved long distances to find better paid work and living conditions.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; I'm not sure you know how money works.

I'm not sure you do.  Do you imagine when currency is exchanged that one party simply burns the money they have received?  That money continues to exist.  What do we, as a country, care that the Chinese have found someone else to offload our bits of paper on to?  That new holder is in exactly the same position as the original holder -- they have currency that can only be exchanged for value in the UK.  We printed the money at almost negligible cost and we have used it to buy a power station.

&gt; You are aware that they can take them down to the post office and exchange them into any currency they please, including their own.

I am.  I'm not sure you've understood what an exchange is.  (I'm very amused at the idea of them exchanging it for their own currency -- the other party must want our currency more)

If you were going to offer the more reasonable attack, that printing money lowers its value, then you might have a case.  When they go to the exchange, they will get less value for their pounds than they thought.  But remember it's the person who prints the money who gets the advantage -- the first spender.

However, I'm not suggesting that we print money to pay them.  That's to miss the point.  The point is that when we pay for imports in our own currency, that currency continues to exist, and must eventually be used to buy exports -- be they government bonds, financial advice, or ships.  Trade is always good; if the Chinese are willing to produce a nuclear power station more cheaply than someone in the UK is, there is no problem with that.  Eventually, they have to buy something we are better at producing with that same money.  It's the core idea at the [heart of all economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage), and was the basis for Adam Smith's _The Wealth Of Nations_.

No one has said anyone will be printing money.

Your post is making *no* sense at all, it's honestly so idiotic I have no idea what you are trying to argue or what your point is. 

"" The point is that when we pay for imports in our own currency, that currency continues to exist, and must eventually be used to buy exports -- be they government bonds, financial advice, or ships.""

No no it does not. 

We give the Chinese our money, it's their money, not our money, our money is gone, they have it.

&gt; 
&gt; No no it does not. 

What?  The money doesn't continue to exist?  Where do you get that from?  The Chinese aren't burning it.

&gt; We give the Chinese our money, it's their money, not our money, our money is gone, they have it.

I didn't say it was our money.  They own it.  But it's our currency.  It is only useful back in the UK.  Where it has to be spent.

&gt; They will either exchange it for whatever currency gives them the most profitable rates or invest it and then maybe build themselves a nice new road in China or something.

If they exchange it, then that new holder of it must have wanted it more than they wanted what they had.  Why?  To use in the UK.

If they build a nice new road in China with those pounds, then they give it someone in exchange for a road.  That person must have been willing to accept those pounds.  Why?  Because they will either trade it or exchange it just the same.

&gt; Only people in the UK who will see any of that money will be stockbrokers and bankers. 

What did these stockbrokers and bankers do to get it though?  Whatever it was -- that was an export.

And why do these stock brokers and bankers want it?  Why were they willing to exchange valuable stocks for this valueless paper?  Because they value it, because it can be used to trade for goods and services.

Looking at the UK survey, only onshore wind is cheaper. The other seven methods of energy generation are more expensive than nuclear.

Lets have a look at France this time. Surprise surprise, nuclear is again one of the cheapest methods of energy generation they use, with only hydro power being cheaper. How about California? Nuclear in the bottom half of the table again. Same again in Australia.

BTW, the reason the gas hike is so difficult to swallow is also because the average wage in the UK is so low.

To give you a comparison, the average wage in [Australia](http://mattcowgill.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/what-is-the-typical-australians-income-in-2013/) is AUD$70K or £41K.

UK is roughly £26K.

I'm seeing jobs for engineers that are between £20K to £30K. Why would anyone study engineering, take on a debt, and then earn below the average wage?

Even if the country ""is in crisis"" the companies we (I live here now) work for are selling their merchandise overseas to the same people the Australians are selling their stuff to.  i.e. they're earning the same money. If you run an internet business, your market is global. There's no *valid reason* not to pay the same wages.

It's well known that people can pay the British lower wages. I've heard that from Australian friends who are thinking of moving their businesses here.

My point is that there is no 'natural overlap' between the careers of Cech and Courtois - one will have to give. I would be stunned if Cech was sold in the summer, or if he was on the bench.

TL;DW: It's most likely probable due to new and more focused research that ""obesity"" is a body-like reaction similar to a bruising on your foot. You don't jibe a person's bruise (as in the condition that the foot has bruised) because the bruise is not the problem, so making fun of ""obesity"" is pointless.  
It would be best to focus on what caused the injury for the body to react in that way (so moving the table or chair away to a safer area, better awareness and so on), to stop the body becoming injured and protecting itself that way (via a bruise / becoming obese)

The probable reason the body becomes obese ""as a proxy"" is because without the ability, humans would just die a lot more often so obesity is the best ""coping mechanism"" way for our bodies to cope with ""a crisis"" within us.

&gt;and that will go up with inflation

But go down in real terms with interest, which will go up when we start making more things because we have cheaper electricity.

&gt;Why people keep talking about France when the specifics of our deal are known is beyond me. 

That is because it is beyond you.  France has control of ever rising prices, has reliable energy, cheaper rates and the second largest nuclear energy programme outside the US.  Germany on the other hand is facing brownouts, and 20% price hikes on what are already some the highest energy prices, having distanced itself from nuclear.   

&gt;The real issue, incredibly, is in the UK it is easier to get planning permission for a fucking nuclear plant than for wind turbines.

That's because the fucking nuclear power plant works, provides reliable energy, creates jobs in the local communities ten miles down from the coast where you tucked the station away, whilst you can cover the entire bloody countryside with wind turbines, which will hike your energy prices, and you'll still have to build another power plant because not a solitary one of them will turn if the wind doesn't blow or, heaven forbid, blows too much.  

They're vanity projects which simply don't work, and your do-goodery in a matter which you even admit is 'beyond you' is responsible for sending jobs to the emerging economies where they have no such qualms about burning coal.",0,1382027309,null,0,1382029210,0,cctnkoq,t3_1omv4l,t1_cctnkoq,t1_cctn2b2,null,1429098019,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

No; I just observed that I was writing the same as I had already and so what followed was inevitable going to be the same as what had passed.

&gt; You are aware that the money that gets to places like India just circulates round India and never comes back here, that or it all ends up being laundered by criminals - this is particularly true in the case of eastern Europe. 

This is bits of paper that we exchanged for a power station?  That nobody ever cashes in?  That's meant to be bad is it?

Money is a promise, not value.  If that promise is never redeemed, so much the better.

&gt; It's very very very bad for our economy for this to happen and is always discouraged.

Free trade is not discouraged.

&gt; The reason is that we have layers of tax here, you have your NI and income tax, which most people who do the money back home thing don't pay and then you have your VAT, which the government won't get because it's not being spent in this country.

That's a diagonal comparison.  You're not comparing locally bought with foreign bought.  You're comparing local white markets with foreign black markets.  Not paying income taxes is a separate issue.

&gt; It's what you call a leaking economy.

If you like.  Giving your argument a name doesn't make it any more valid.

I know how you hate economists, but still...

&gt; ""In the foregoing part of this chapter I have endeavoured to show, even upon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it is to lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous. Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this [absurd] doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium.""

http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/6302.0~May+2013~Main+Features~Key+Figures?OpenDocument

&gt; Full-time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings	$1 422.70

52 x 1422.70 = $73980 (GBP44,135)

UK I found this: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2012-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2012.html

&gt; In April 2012 median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees were £506, up 1.5% from £498 in 2011.

Which is £26K ... but it does say ""median"". 

I Googled the average in the first instance.

UPDATE: I found a link to a [zip file containing Excel spreadsheets from that ons website](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2012-provisional-results/2012-provisional-table-1.zip):

&gt; Annual pay - Gross (£) - For all employee jobs: United Kingdom, 2012""

&gt; All Employees, 21,198,000, median: £21,473 +1.8, average: £26,664 +0.2

&gt; All Full-time Employees, 15,258,000 jobs, median: £26,462 +1.4, average: £32,708 +0.1

So closer to the Australian average for full-time. (maybe)

The Australian stat was adult employees though, so the figures could possibly be higher for the UK.

They have no standing charge so you only pay for what you use, albeit with slightly higher per-unit costs than some other suppliers.

This works well for me, however I can see that paying a standing charge and lower unit cost could perhaps work better for people in different circumstances to myself.

I'll tell you my tale of speech therapy. I had a lisp as a child and had speech therapy on the NHS. ""Sammy Snake Says Ess."" That was the 1960's. I was young and don't remember any more than that.

The therapy stopped short. I still used the f sound for both f and th so my ""free"" and ""three"" came out the same and I never realised that they were supposed to be different. Also, I did that w thing for r's. In some parts of the country that is an accent, but not where I lived.

Many years later I joined the computer programming side of an artificial intelligence project aiming to get computers to recognise speech in the sense of taking dictation. Oddly they didn't want me to contribute to the data base of human speech used by the project. I learned some phonetics as part of my job. F and TH were different. WTF. A friend taught me to pronounce R.

I found a singing teacher to give me speaking lessons. He had qualifications LRAM  ALCM. He knew his stuff and helped me consolidate and improve on what I had already learned. Back in 1991 he charged £40 for five half-hour lessons. Well worth it.

I tell my tale because your comment ""I can articulate it in my mind but the phsyical side of it is no good."" seems strangely under specific. But if you are like me, you don't know what you don't know. I suggest pulling on that thread.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Benefits should not be.

And they aren't. Try applying for housing benefit with £60,000 a year net income some time, tell us how it goes.

&gt;I don't think you've understood the 10% rate. It's the rate on savings interest.

No, that is the rate you pay on INCOME. Instead of paying 20%, up to £2790 of your income can be taxed at 10% subject to you putting a full £2790 into savings. Income through *interest* on your savings is then taxed at 50%, but the actual money initially deposited is taxed at 10% (as opposed to 20)

&gt;Again though you've made it seem that every single person on minimum wage is in the same circumstances, with half their rent paid by the council. That simply isn't the case. It's also nothing to do with tax rates.

&gt;It's also nothing to do with tax rates

""can someone explain to me why people on minimum wage have to pay tax, without explaining how they don't actually make a net contribution to taxes""

&gt;don't do it by making some convoluted system where you tax then give it back

...

It's not convoluted to treat everyone the same, and provide help to people who need the same kind of help through the same system. You make *nothing* any simpler by not taxing the income of low earners, *then* adjusting their benefits payments to a level below what everyone else recieves. 

&gt;Rerun of numbers using 13124 (and treating employer's NI as if the employee paid it, which they effectively do)...

The employer pays national insurance out of your wages. 12% of your income is taken out *before* you recieve it,  before your employer deducts income tax (if they do that for you). That means your cost to employer is £13,124. Your income tax is then £736 (or £457 if you put £2790 in savings) [and your national insurance is **12%**](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/how-much-national-insurance-you-pay) of gross income, £645. Your total paid in tax is £1381 or £1102 with your full possible amount going into savings. As I said before, go and type a gross income of 13124 into any uk tax calculator if you don't believe me. You pay 8.3% of your income if you use savings and (dunno how I got this wrong) 10.5% if you don't. You get (if you are the average person renting in the UK) £5100 to cover rent. If you don't use the system you are supposed to use to make up your income to a comfortable level, don't complain that your income is not at a comfortable level. The government literally throw money at you just for not being wealthy, if you choose not to pick it up you have yourself to blame.

He tracks back well but his forward intent is covered by having a fullback behind him usually.  I wouldn't mind giving it a try, but I'm not sure that he's the right player for it.  Sterling also did really well tracking back and defending when he came on, which I really wasn't expecting for him.  Generally he seems to not pay too much attention to his defensive responsibilities.  If he can do it then I'd imagine Moses can too, it's just the same worry for both players.

I'd love to see Gerrard in an attacking role again because IMO that was his best position when he was at his peak and just to see him there is confidence inspiring.  You can tell he still wants to get up the pitch and find the goals too. But I don't think we'll see it.  I don't think he has the legs for his style of direct attacking play at this point and he doesn't quite have the positional awareness/sense that someone like Lampard does (it's freakish how often Lampard finds himself exactly where the ball drops in a dangerous position after a blocked pass/shot/deflection) to really help mitigate his lack of pace and diminishing direct power.  

If Gerrard was to play in the attacking role of our midfield 5 then I think it becomes really crucial that Henderson stays at RWB since he'll be the most reliable and disciplined in his defensive duties.  I wouldn't mind seeing Allen sitting in next to Lucas at that point, he can defend well/cover for and feed Gerrard to kickstart the attack and keep possession ticking over in sustained possession.

Definitely get breakdown cover, I use AA and have never had a problem (it's cheaper to sign up as a new customer every year than renew FYI). Luckily I have an agreement with my boss whereby he will pay for any taxis should I ever break down, but if this isn't your case look into AA relay (or equivalent) - if you break down they'll take you anywhere in the country (eg that important meeting).

Get a stereo with aux-in or USB and pick some good songs/audiobooks. My windscreen seals whistle badly so I listen to a different album daily at full blast, but I know others who listen to a few audiobook chapters a day.

Get some sunglasses for the car, not really a winter accessory but you'll be killing yourself when your blinded on a crisp December morning.

I have the following spare stuff in the boot, might be a bit overkill but I've used a lot of it: Spare shirt, trousers, socks, first aid kit, jump leads, umbrella, spare tyre, jack/axle stand, spare bulbs, de-icer (lots), warning triangle, high-vis jackets, copies of insurance info, spare footwell mats (for getting out of snow/ice), torch (and spare batteries!), blankets, map.

Learn what's under your bonnet and how to do basic roadside repairs: eg how to fix a blown headlight, how to refill your rad, how to change a tyre etc etc.

This is all I can think of right now, definitely take a look on Google maps and get to know some of the roads/alternate routes as well. Also if you ever get the opportunity to do so, take your car to a car park in the snow and practice skidding and sliding at a lowish speed. If it snows and you have work you have no choice but to risk it, learning how to control your car under dangerous circumstances could be lifesaving.

You will shed weight or ""swelling of your body"" in a similar fashion to stopping the swelling of a bruise. A person is swelling because the body is trying to cope or is overreacting to the injury. 

Being insulin resistant makes your body ""swell"". A person needs to reverse or stop the insulin resistance to begin to lose weight / reverse the swell. To be less insulin resistant means having a diet suitable for your body to do the reversing and keeping it in check. Exercising extremely helps the flow in keeping your body in check. 

So it's not about just ""shed weight by eating less"", it's about eating the right food for your body in a controlled and capable way while exercising to help (as a beneficial catalytic effect).

You can be insulin resistant without the body ""swelling"" (as in insulin resistant with no signs of becoming obese).

To even approach the reliability of one nuclear plant you'd have to take every turbine in the world and relocate it to the UK and even then if the wind doesn't blow then you've got nothing.  On an average UK summer night the wind industry runs on average at 15% capacity.  When there's a low pressure anticyclone hanging overhead it's been known to drop under 1%.

It's absolutely terrible.

Wind includes massive subsidy, and in the case of Germany has created a situation where they are seriously risking brown outs and it has started cannibalising its own backups when the wind *does* blow!  The cost of the nuclear unit price?  Not subsidised.

&gt;We are getting wind cheaper than nuclear

Are you factoring in that for wind you also require to have an under-powered gas station inefficiently ticking over in the background when the source of the power, which is completely out of your control i.e. the wind, goes away?

No.  Of course you're not.

You want to make an argument that requires that we only look at a fraction of the spreadsheet.  You're arguing that it's cheaper if, and only if, we ignore this, and this, and this.

There is consolation however.  The public attitude has already begun to shift.  Even in Germany where they really did have a lot of support for renewables people are starting to wake up that it simply is not working and bills are getting higher and higher.

&gt;On top of this wind efficiency is increasing much faster than nuclear efficiency 

It's not very efficient when the wind doesn't blow.

Can't just pack up a factory and tell the workforce to go home because it's not blustery enough, or too blustery, outside.

And on this 'efficiency' when it does blow, they're becoming more efficient in raising subsidy because thats how their gearboxes are starting to be set up now.  Not to make most electricity but to get most subsidy.

Windfarm subsidy accounts for £100 000 for every job it creates.

I'm sorry but no, the human body is much more complex than this to simply put the answer into such terms.

For example, hemlock is low in calories, so a person should eat it to lose weight?  
I use hemlock to push the fundamental point that it is the body's processing of the diet which is also a critical decider on a person's weight loss. 

You have completely omitted that. 

Insulin resistance to what you eat means whether you lose weight or not. Just taking ""calories out"" of something which causes a body to have high insulin resistance, due to how the body reacts and processes it, is really not a good idea to advocate at all.

Not really. Ireland had 16 years between independence from the UK and the removal of the queen as head of state, and they're not exactly clamouring to have her back.

true,Winter_S,null,null,"I live in Eastbourne so I can give a few places I like to go around the area.

To put it straight, there isn't a lot to do in Eastbourne. There is the Pier which is located on the Seafront, just go into town and either follow the signs or ask around.

The Redoubt Fortress is also quite nice to visit too.

As for food places in Eastbourne, I can't really recommend anywhere unfortunately.

As for other places nearby, I can recommend plenty.

Firstly is a pub called ""The Green Man"". [It is located here](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=the+green+man+ringmer&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=jThgUoyGCsHM0QXiuYGQCQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAA) (not sure if this link will work properly as I am on mobile) and it is bloody fantastic. The staff are friendly and the portions of meals are really big, and really good value for money. Nothing is too expensive. A 12oz Gammon steak with a big portion of chips and salad is only about £10 (which is very good value if you are not sure). This is basically a traditional English pub. (It is about a 40 min drive from where I live.)

Secondly is Brighton. Brighton is a City located just next door to Eastbourne (Its basically my second home) If you are getting a Bus to Brighton, get the number 12 on the left hand side of Terminus Road in Eastbournes Town centre and it is about 1:30 hours to get to ""Churchill Square"". [Google Maps link here](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=brighton+churchill+square&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=TDpgUvieFsX80QWKnoGIDA&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAA).

In Churchill Square there are a number of high end shops, set on 2/3 floors (Debenhams is 3 floors, and there are a couple of restaurants on the third floor such as McDonald's, but that is it for the 3rd floor). There are several clothing shops too.

If you go down the road down the road (the road which has the clock tower) and walks down the ""hill"" try and find a place called ""The Laines"" (ask around, it's easy enough). There is a North and South version of this. Both are good but i'd recommend the South Laines. It is normally quite busy down these roads but the shops and cafes are some of the most unique I have ever seen. Definitely worth checking out, as you will most likely find a perfect souvenir to bring back (although, I'd reccomend the North Laines for that (warning, you will probably get lost in the vastness of the Laines in general))

As for food places in Brighton, there are too many. I'd reccomend a place called ""[Pompoko](http://pompoko.co.uk/)"" which is a bloody nice Japanese restaurant. It is quite small but the food is very good value for money and the service is good and quick.

[As for other food places in Brighton, check this out](http://www.reddit.com/r/brighton/comments/vablp/visiting_brighton_need_somewhere_to_eat/). It is very useful.

Just look around the main area of Brighton (check out the pier) as it is very big and there is too much to even out into words.

Moving on from Brighton, I will recommend one last place. That is [Wakehurst Place.](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wakehurst-place/) You can read about it in that site, but if you get a chance, you should visit it. It is a very nice and relaxing place to go and the Seed Bank is really interesting to look at. It isn't for everyone but you are missing out if you don't go.

I will try and think of more places if I can but hopefully this is enough. If you want, we could always meet in person in town or wherever and if there is any places you would like to visit, I could try and reccomend any places I know of. (Feel free to PM me if you want)

I'm not sure this is true.  The official secrets act has quite a broad scope.  Some of Snowden's leaks pertain to UK spying programs, some others to inter-governmental intelligence agreements.

&gt; The Guardian is perfectly within its rights, as far as I know, to hold these documents.

IANAL, but as far as understand the official secrets act, they can be prosecuted if they publish anything covered by it that may greatly threaten national security.
  How much a specific article threatens national security would ultimately be a decision made by a court.  It's also feasible that if the prosecution made a convincing argument that the data wasn't properly secured that even unpublished documents could be problematic.

But no, I see what you're saying. But I also don't think that just because of the ""current climate"" we should have to settle for a bad deal. Royal Mail is profitable, mostly because WE have modernised, our rounds are longer, and we have shed THOUSANDS of jobs. We are working harder than before, we are spending more time on our rounds, carrying heavier loads. WE are the reason the company is profitable, but it's the MANAGERS who keep receiving generous bonuses. 

And what change are you talking about? Privitisation? Did you notice that it was only AFTER we announced that we would be balloting for strike action that the government RUSHED the sale through? 

And everyone has the right to strike. That's one of the rights we have. We ballot our members, it's a completely democratic process. We don't LIKE going on strike, though. We lose money. We have lost a 300 quid ""incentive"" by calling this ballot. We will be losing pay. It's not, despite what some people in this thread seem to think, a cozy holiday. We don't do it lightly. We truly believe we don't have a choice. 

And finally, the three years is not even that. This agreement was supposed to have been reached by April of this year, so even if we DO agree to it, it's really only 2 1/2 years. 

Fine, you know what? I'm entitled. I'm entitled to be a member of a union, to participate in collective bargaining, and if the management refuses to negotiate, then I am entitled to be balloted for strike action. We are all entitled to exactly the same.

If he is, thus making him the 9th Doctor, that pushes everyone back (9 is 10, 10 is 11, 11 is 12, Capaldi is 13 aka the last Doctor) BUT if the regeneration does count from ""Journey's End"" Matt Smith is now the last Doctor forcing Moffat to explain how he regenerate's past 13 times, which would be FANTASTIC to say the least.

true,spiz,null,null,"Your body's complexity doesn't really enter into it.  The fact that it can't create weight or mass (First Law of Thermodynamics) means that you cannot gain mass you don't eat.  Therefore if Calories In &gt; Calories Out you put on weight - I'll grant you that the coefficient (how much is absorbed) is different for each person, but to lose weight you need to cut down your calorific intake.  If it doesn't work, cut some more.  Is it difficult? Fuck yes; so what?

The idea that exercise contributes to weight-loss is pretty, but is not a huge contribution (unless you exercise an insane amount).  An hour of tennis works out at less than 2 pints of beer.  I'd have to play over 2 hours of tennis to work off a meal from Burger King.  It does make it easier to sustain the weight loss.  The idea is lifestyle change and that's never going to be easy, so whatever helps is good.

What that chap in the video doesn't explain is how his Insulin Resistance improved by losing weight (note that he says he had Diabetes, but Diabetes is irreversible - ""Impaired Glucose Tolerance"" is the reversible thing, so he's being a little disingenuous) - did his Insulin Resistance conveniently get better incidentally as he made an effort to lose weight?  We have a model that explains the pathogenesis of diabetes, successfully explains how we can improve it and even see it regress (when still in early, ""IGT"" stages).  We see that weight loss gives improved glycaemic control and we see that improved control leads to less complications.

The other thing he doesn't explain is why on earth he thinks he's right.  Not all obese people get diabetes.  So what?! Not all smokers get lung cancer.  Not all alcoholics will develop liver cirrhosis.  Guess what? 1/10 lung cancers are not related to smoking and some people get cirrhosis without drinking.  We know there are many, different types of diabetes anyway and that people are predisposed to it in different ways (genetics plays a role, obviously). He talks for 15 minutes and **never** proposes any evidence of any kind for his ideas.  He might as well have blamed obesity on evil aliens trying to destroy us.  Instead I see his has a thriving business based on his idea, but can't find any papers he's written on diabetes.

Having aired my profound disagreement with the chap in the video, I would also like to point out that even if whateverthefuckwedon'tknowabout is responsible for diabetes - it makes no difference to people today.  We know weight loss reduces your chances of getting diabetes.  We know once you have diabetes, losing weight will help you avoid complications.  We all know losing weight is difficult, but it works.  It's a bit like cutting alcohol and cigarettes, but it's not a pleasant comparison.

PS - the hemlock argument is nonsense.  You need to suggest evidence for thinking the guy's right (since he fails to do so).  All you are saying is ""There a thing in the food that's giving us diabetes, and I know this because hemlock kills you, even though it's not fattening"".",0,1382043977,null,0,1382044523,0,cctukkf,t3_1onb7l,t1_cctukkf,t1_cctqjue,null,1429094636,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Many people using them have jobs, or others are on benefits. Both provide an income which, while not necessarily amazing, is enough to eat on unless they are spending money elsewhere.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"Below age ten a child will accurately imitate the speech sounds that they hear. They learn their native language like a native. By age twelve that facility is gone; though a better word might be *frozen*. Confronted by a foreign language, with unfamiliar sounds, the child picks the most similar sound from their own language and sticks with it, learning to speak with an accent.

What seems to be going on is that the brain is not so much learning to process language as learning to process language *efficiently*. The brain learns to ignore distinctions between sounds that do not matter in ones native tongue. Indeed, the brain learns to discard the differences before they reach consciousness; it becomes hard to even hear the difference.

If something goes wrong during development (perhaps a spell of glue ear?) one can end up stuck. Some sounds that are supposed to be different in your native tongue get lumped together and once you pass 12 years old your brain is telling them that they are the same without letting you hear them.

That raises a question about what you do about this when you go to university, aged 18, to study linguists and phonetics. Basically you have to work bloody hard on listening exercises to retrieve the sense of spoken sounds as *sound* rather than *speech*. One tool is your own mouth and tongue. You can make sounds and listen to them. Small changes in the position of your tongue in your mouth must produce small changes in the sound. Your brain will not let you hear them. For example, the sound will remain S until you go too far and suddenly it is SH. But you know the small changes are there, so you can keep listening until you can hear them again.

The same techniques work for adults trying to fix speech defects left over from childhood. The situation is unreasonably subtle and complicated and consequently it is not widely understood. I stumbled across the facts accidentally, when my career in digital signal processing lead to me studying phonetics in order to work on computer speech recognition.

They would never try and put a law in to stop something like this, as that might gain the ire of other publications and their follows. So, if the government did impose fines on the Guardian, what sort of problems would they really have that they didn't before?

Of course, the supporters of the Guardian in this whole fiasco would be annoyed, but they were annoyed anyway. They weren't going to vote Tory in the next election, so it isn't really like it is votes lost for the government, which is all that matters. 

Other newspapers (like The Daily Mail or the Telegraph) took the leaks as a way to attack the Guardian (and the left in general), labelling them terrorists or traitors. I couldn't see them crossing the lines to support the Guardian should the government fine them, as they are stubborn, and not only would they be going back on their word, but they would also be *agreeing* with the Guardian and the left, which I doubt their readership would appreciate. 

And neutrals don't really care either way. If the leaks in the first place didn't rouse any interest in them then I doubt government fines would either.

His win record is better by 20% over AVB, which though not a massive leap, is substantial considering it includes RDM's ill-fated start to the following season.  Plus, the games he won were harder (knock out matches and the final in both the CL and FA Cup).

AVB's results were on a clear downward slide when he left.  He started well because he inherited a good squad, but the longer he was at the helm, the worse things became.  RDM managed to turn things around in a matter of weeks, despite the fact he virtually conceded the league to focus on the Cup runs.

Basically, I'm not quite sure what your argument is.  You seem to be picking a bone over the fact I said RDM's record at Chelsea was better than AVB's, which frankly, both objectively and subjectively, it is.  We can hypothesise as much as we like as to whether AVB could've won the same two trophies had he been allowed to stick around long enough, but I don't thinking anyone watching them at that point in time felt that way.

If you have a problem with me questioning AVB, then that's a different problem altogether.  I'm happy with him as manager and have high hopes for the future, but I also feel questioning some of his choices, particularly since we've got some clear issues that have not been resolved yet, is totally fair.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, like any place it has dodgy areas where people don't have a lot of money and get involved in the ""wrong"" stuff - there are gang areas in most major UK cities, so the rough areas in Belfast are fairly similar, just that the problems are tied into politics and community beliefs as well as the living standards. These are the areas that usually see the most trouble in terms of rioting.

However, many of the ""suburb"" areas are lovely and the only way they're affected by any rioting or whatever is if the buses stop running for the whole city due to the risk to the bus drivers in small areas, or things like that. There are some areas not far outside Belfast (easily less than half an hour's drive, maybe more in rush hour commute) where it's gorgeous countryside, small communities, beaches and good schools - in fact, our schools are ""on average"" a much better standard than England as we don't really have private schools, we have grammar schools and high schools (so your kids can go to a very good secondary school with no extra cost to you other than uniforms and stuff).

Belfast itself is fairly small and actually comes up on lists of the safest cities for tourists, because we have very little ""random crime"", the only danger is really if you're in a bad area or you know bad people, or you're being silly (going out to ""watch the riots"" as some tourists do). And if you were still concerned about that, you could easily move to one of the small towns/villages around Belfast and commute in (most are well under an hour's drive) - some of the nice ones that spring to mind are [Holywood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holywood) (which has a very good grammar school in it and is right on the beach) and [Crossgar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossgar) (tiny little village, near Downpatrick which has a very good grammar school as well, very rural feeling but maybe 30-40 mins from Belfast city centre). We also have very little rush hour traffic (an extra 10 minutes to most journeys) and the country villages and towns are so close that it's probably a hell of a lot quicker than trying to get across London or something like that!

I'd definitely recommend seeing if you can pop over for a short holiday at some point even if you weren't thinking about moving here, and trying to change your view. It's not much different to most cities, and it's really easy to forget that there's political issues at all, so long as you don't watch the news too much. I don't even know that there's riots going on when they happen until I hear the news, because they're in places I would usually never go to anyway.

**Edit:** Also, [here's](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+Kingdom&amp;city=Belfast) a thing about living costs in Belfast.

If this is a downtime for him, its really not that bad. He's still done his job at an above average level. Maybe not world class all the time, but he's been a solid DM so far. When he's on good form, he's easily one of the best DMs in the league. Bad form, he's still better than many of the leagues DMs and is still our strongest choice in the squad. 

Adjusting to to the new formation may also be a factor. We've been pressed back into our own half for a majority of the games we've played. Been relying on counters to get our goals and get the ball out of our half. Its hard for a DM to look good when the opponent is comfortable in your half of the field, passing around the top of the half. More players in our half means the DM is gonna have a bad time. its much harder to cut passing lanes when the attacker has teammates nearby. Even if he makes a tackle, an opposing player is nearby to pick up the loose ball or pressure Lucas himself. getting Johnson and Coutinho back should shift the majority of play towards the middle which will make Lucas' job much easier. Less pressure on him, and easier to read the game if he has to worry about fewer opposing players.

&gt;Would Hodgson have used the term were Andros Townsend – the most exciting thing to happen to English football in years – a white player? Maybe – maybe not. Even Roy Hodgson won’t be aware of how deeply and subconsciously his own mind has linked the brownness of a player’s skin, with humanity’s simian ancestors. We all carry heavy linguistic baggage.

I don't know, maybe it's not for this sub, I just thought it was a pretty incredible passage - implying he ""might or might not"" have told that specific joke because Townsend is black... not some other joke though. Of all his stories and jokes, he told that one because he saw the player was black and it influenced him? He specifically chose that one because subconsciously he is racist? 

Could it not just be a favourite joke of a guy who grew up during the space age?

EDIT: FWIW, he was obviously on dodgy ground telling it, I just don't like the implication that it was subconsciously racist. The author admits Hodgson is not a racist, it's a bizarre leap.

For the religion/atheism thing, it's a weird mix. Religion is quite important here, culturally and historically, especially the divides between Protestantism and Catholicism, yet I vaguely remember seeing that the Republic of Ireland has the highest rate of people ""converting"" to atheism/agnosticism in Europe according to recent censuses, and I think Northern Ireland is probably in a similar situation - many younger people especially aren't interested.

Most schools in Northern Ireland are still somewhat divided by ""religion"" (which also implies community and/or political views), but there are many integrated primary and secondary schools and most of the other schools have a fair mix of both communities, plus a huge amount of people who don't care either way. Personally, I don't know many people who are actually religious, either as Protestants or Catholics (or anything else for that matter), but that might just be because of the kinds of people I spend time with. It's still considered a somewhat private/personal thing here, so the only intrusion is that religion is tied into other things here (saying that you were Catholic would imply that you were probably also Nationalist and not a fan of the Queen, for example), but being an atheist is quite normal and other than the usual religious old people tutting, no one would look down upon it - my grandparents are the only people who have ever really commented negatively on me being an atheist, and I don't hide it at all.

From what I've noticed, Protestant schools tend to be the ""default"" schools for people who aren't religious, as they don't usually have any religious services in the regular schedule and don't require anything like confession, and also usually have less religious topics taught (some Catholic schools here teach creationism and things like that). Jobs ask religion, usually giving the choices ""Protestant"", ""Roman Catholic"" and ""Other"", when you apply but that's because they legally have to record it to show they're promoting equal opportunities and stuff like that, they're not allowed to discriminate based on it at all. So other than schools and job applications, it really doesn't come up much, if at all, in Northern Ireland unless people are using it to insinuate political/community affiliations. So someone could come from a ""Catholic family"" without them actually being religious, it would more mean the kind of area their family was from or their family's views on Northern Ireland being part of the UK or Ireland.",0,1382055594,null,0,false,0,cctz1iw,t3_1on5y3,t1_cctz1iw,t1_cctxk7t,null,1429092549,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Girls are feminised from childhood by being taught rules that subjugate them, she argued.""

Season 1 was terrible. It felt like it was written for radio, rather than TV, and the characters were constantly describing what they saw. The plot progressed very slowly. You could tell who was a good guy and who was a bad guy because the good guys were good looking and the bad guys were ugly.

I tried season 17 because the script editor was Douglas Adams (of _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ fame). Mildly amusing, very hokey, not very exciting. It's not bad per se, but I wouldn't say it's good.

I started season 23 because I wanted to learn more about one of the characters that features in it prominently and might be coming up again sometime soon in New Who. Like season 17, it wasn't bad, but it didn't really hold my attention.

Inferno parralel universes, lava monsters and other sci fi staples and Jon Pertwee being great. Tomb of the Cybermen Patrick Troughton in one of his best stories, which is a very good thing.

Actually I thought his comments were quite well worded.  Particularly his point about the way we too often treat our elderly as if they're an inconvenience.

This moving back in together thing is a very common thing here in Japan, to the point where you can see a clear difference between the attitudes towards elderly relatives of our culture and that of the Japanese.  It works out pretty well for them, and I respect the way they go about things.  One benefit it brings is that it often helps the younger generation get on the property ladder (or a bunk up to a better level) if they haven't managed to do so.  Quite a lot of parents by the time they're retirement age own homes with mortgages already paid off.  They sell up, and use this money to put a large deposit down on a big house (often 3 floors with the parents taking one floor, and the younger family the other two).  When the parents eventually die, the house just remains with the kids or grandchildren and they end up with a substantial property with a relatively low mortgage.  In return the parents get cared for, and have the company of their family during their remaining years.  When I built my house a couple of years ago, I asked our architect about how business was going, and he pretty much said that these big 2-generation shared homes were sustaining his business, and were the single largest growth area in house building.

Sure, it can't work for everyone - not all parents have homes, some need specialist care, location may not allow it etc.  In Japan it's easier in a lot of cases because single child families are much more common, so there's no debate about which sibling gets the house.  Absolutely, there are a whole raft of reasons why it doesn't suit everyone.  It doesn't work for all Japanese either (or all Asians for that), but I don't think just bringing up the idea is particularly evil.  It's a pretty good suggestion for people who are in a position to consider it.  I think the proposal to bring in a better inspectorate for care homes is hardly a bad thing either.

I realize that frankly most Tories, Hunt included, could find a cure for cancer, and a lot of people in this subreddit would still go out of their way to find a reason to fault it, but really having read his quote in its entirety and seen what he's actually saying, I pretty much agree with his sentiment. And it's one possible idea that is worth thinking about.  Sure, many people are wonderful to their elderly relatives, but as a whole, we do have a pretty poor record compared to other cultures for slinging our older generations into homes and leaving them to die - I don't think that's in any way an inaccurate statement.",0,1382080925,null,0,1382086175,0,ccu732k,t3_1op4xz,t1_ccu732k,t3_1op4xz,null,1429088772,48,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,48

I worked as a contractor, so I was moving between employers any way. I think I worked for 8 months with one employer.

I had several friends, engineering and computer come over, who worked for various employers. The employers who wanted to keep them simply organised proper working visas and fixed it all up.

There are coal mines all around Sydney, BTW. e.g. [Gordon to Singleton](http://goo.gl/maps/78KXn). It's not a bad distance.  You would be a lot closer to your GF. There are also mines to the South, near Wollongong.

I'm not try to be facetious, but to put it bluntly... you think those don't exist in Japan?  Of course, you don't, but that's my point.

One of the problems we have as a culture (or at least it seems like it sometimes) is that we're always looking for excuses and reasons why we *can't* do something.  Why it's society's fault, not ours.  Things have to be either handed to us on a plate, or they're just too difficult.  Sure, I'm totally exaggerating to emphasize the point, but our country is significantly less indebted than Japan, and has had a significantly healthier economy for the last couple of decades.

We look around and mutter to each other about every instance where we're expected to contribute or do something to better society.  Out of work - have to pick up litter?  Oh noes!  That's an affront to my humanity!  If that happened in the country I live in now, I can guarantee you people would be right behind it as a decent idea to give out-of-workers something useful to contribute.  I'm not saying that they're right and we're wrong (god knows there are plenty of things I love more about the UK and British people, and plenty of things that annoy the hell out of me about my current home), but the point is we often go out of our way to make things appear as difficult as possible, when, in reality, it's no easier for cultures like Japan.

That's a fair comment; but I think it's only true in certain circumstances.

If money coming back is inflationary, then money leaving is deflationary.  Overall then it would be a wash.  The question is whether, when the money leaves, the government replaces it with some freshly printed.  But then it hardly seems fair to blame the inflation on import/exports when our own government would be the ones running the printing press.

Your observations about the lengths to which governments have gone to control their currencies are well made.

I kind of see what you're saying, but I think the best guarantee of privacy is lack of computerised organisation of IDs - that way it becomes much harder to cross-check what a single person has used their card for.

My mother in law has been in ill health for 20-30 years, and her husband is not getting any healthier - At the time they moved in they where both in their 80s.

About a year ago my mother in law died. So its just me, my wife, my son and my father in law and a house full of old peoples tat :)


Anyway.....To do this with any effectiveness we needed a larger house, me and my wife both wanted kids. So we needed a house that was large enough on the ground floor for the olds (they cant get up stairs), also had atleast 3 decent size rooms, and a downstairs toilet that a wheel chair could get into.

Speaking of wheelchairs - doors needed to be large enough to move around.

Finding a house that has these things is harder than you might expect...

All of this meant we needed to sell both of our original houses and buy somewhere new. This is not the sort of thing the average person can do or afford to do.

So while I accept in an ideal world we should look after our relatives if we can, its simply not practical for most people.

EON: 4.053ppu / £95.23 standing charge  
EDF: 4.042ppu / £91.25 standing charge  
NPower: 3.891ppu / £118.63 standing charge  
Scottish Power: 3.904 / £104.75 standing charge  
SSE: 4.340ppu / £95.27 standing charge

It looks to me, that if you were to average these out, you're looking at a very similar price across the board. Yes BG have the highest price per unit, but they also have the cheapest standing charge; I'm not mathematician, so I'll let someone else do the math.

Jokes aside, surely you can't think he's better than Sandro or Paulinho? Paulinho seems to have a much broader scope of ability, where dembele leans on evasion and strength a little to much. Sandro is much better at reading the play, making interceptions (same with Capoue) and filling the gaps in the back four when 1-3 of said 4 venture up field. 

Dembele certainly makes forward passes, but they never seem to be clever defence splitting through balls or anything with much creativity. There doesn't need to be much of the clever through balls, i just feel like there isn't any at all... There seems to be no end product with dembele, and maybe that's a coaching thing, but I feel that it's an ability that he greatly lacks that possession happy midfielders MUST have.

2) The old people we are discussing are right to feel let down. They paid taxes their whole lives, believing they were contributing to a welfare state that has in fact been frittered away into the pockets of the boards of big private companies.

3) There is a point in doing a ""menial"" job if it covers the bills. If you work hard and it doesn't cover the bills, then people will only do those jobs as a last resort. Currently most of the people on benefits do work. At ""shit"" jobs. And there is no way those people could afford a 1 bedroom flat in most places, let alone a 5 or even 4 bedroom house.

&gt; Have you ever heard of a nurse/soldier/teacher say ""actually, we've got everything we need, we're well paid enough, and the money is better spent elsewhere"".

Yes. My parents were both teachers and do you know what they would have done if they were running the place? Put the money into the schools to buy better equipment or to hire more TAs. My Mum was regularly in that position, actually, as a deputy head and used the money to buy newer, better computer equipment so the kids had better access. You seem to think that all they would do is say ""Right, all teachers get pay rises!"" when in actual fact, most teachers would much rather that money was spent on furthering education.

The problem with some fucking stupid prick like Gove (and most past education ministers) is they don't actually give a fuck about whether the current system works or not, they only care about changing things to 'make their mark'. Many of the recent changes have been almost universally denounced by teachers as stupid and pointless.

We crammed everyone in, lived under each others feet, but got on with it.  Nothing in that situation forced my father to leave his parents to rot in a home.  For many people that's not just being a victim of circumstance.  It's a choice.

Not saying anyone can do it, but these businesses/services are popping up everywhere.

*Which is a good thing!* How is this not being understood? There are few jobs as important as teaching and few institutions as important as education. Seriously, without good schools and good teachers, there are no other professions! 

&gt; I don't understand the caretaker analogy.

You think the guy working on the oil rig know how a power station works? Probably not, in the same way a caretaker probably doesn't know a whole lot about how a school is run.

The fact is, teachers are underpaid and under appreciated. I wish I was paid more in my job, sure, but I would never try and claim my job was as hard as teaching. Teachers work fucking daft hours with no overtime. People say, ""Oh, but they finish at half 3 and have long holidays!"" No, they may stop teaching (and being paid) at half 3 but my Dad used to work 7am till 7pm most days. He just only got paid 9am till 3:30.

So when you ask ""who is making choices in the market of trains"" you realise that the only actual choice is that of which company runs which franchise while actual consumers are forced in to a local set of monopolies. 

I understand the arguments for privatisation, the market can be a powerful thing and while I personally don't think it's place is in essential services the fact is that the privatisation of the rail has fundamentally failed to create a market aligned with the interests of the consumer in anyway what so ever.

&gt; Which is a good thing! How is this not being understood? There are few jobs as important as teaching and few institutions as important as education. Seriously, without good schools and good teachers, there are no other professions!

You're right, education is massively important. Everyone wants to put more money into education in a perfect world. As well as policing, social care, health, fire brigades, research and development, etc. The thing is, theres a finite pot, and they can't just put it all in education.  
If you want to increase education spending, you need to either increase taxes, or cut another area.

I'm afraid I feel like your proving my point. You know more about teaching than I do, are (understandably) biased towards your parents viewpoint, and think education is more important than anything else. Like an ex-teacher in the department of education would be.
  
Imagine we're not talking about education, where you've clearly got a strong opinion. Let's say its the military. Do you need to be an ex soldier to be defense secretary? Would the same things apply, mean you're resistant to tough budget decisions etc? Perhaps you're more hawkish than you should be, like the generals you see in American films always wanting to launch huge assaults? (Or maybe you're too much of a dove, not wanting to put ex-comrades in danger)

The good thing about UK house prices is that the gap between a house in the town and a house in the country is not as big as Australia.

I've seen amazing country houses around here (Leicestershire) that would cost millions in Australia, but here they only cost about 2x to 3x the price of a ""good"" house in the town.

e.g. £300K for a large, family house, in a good area. 

But for (starting at) £600K, you can have a choice of some amazing places that are worth more than 2x £300K houses combined once you take into consideration the total land area.

In reality it will be very hard to bring about this kind of social change even within a generation, let alone the next decade.

That aside, in practice this will be very hard to do - not least because unlike Japan very few houses in the UK are physically large enough to accomodate this kind of living arrangement. In japan new-builds are created with this setup in mind, so often are spread over 3 floors with a fully kitted out granny anex (usually with its own kitchen/bathroom and lounge). Since most of the Georgian townhouses have been made into seperate flats you would struggle to find a property with enough bedrooms to accomodate that kind of living these days - especially in the cities where size comes at a BIG premium.

Ultimately, sooner or later the elderly will have to contribute to austerity either financially or by some kind of ""encouraged downsizing"".

true,apocbz,null,null,"&gt;Train companies may very well be in competition but it's in the market of being awarded a franchises not in actually offering travel to consumers. Which are fundamentally different things.

Exactly, and what's worse is that competition at that stage is far more open to manipulation. Dinners, drinks, gifts all pushed to the right person at the right time means the ""competition"" might not even be on price or promises. People vastly underestimate the effect of personal relationships on corporate deals. Look at the fucked up bid for the East Coast mainline.

I also completely agree with this:
&gt;No matter your view on privatisation the rail system should be abhorrent to you.

Nobody can look objectively at the train service in the UK and say it is a shining example of the success of privatisation. All one has to do is travel on a train in Belgium, Holland, Germany or Switzerland to see that the UK service is massively inferior in terms of assets and price.

The most frustrating thing is just how many major problems the current scheme has. I've mentioned 2, (lack of choice for passengers, and potential for corruption at the point of ""choice"")... But there's more! 

- Investment; why do you invest in buying a new fleet of trains when your franchise last 15 years? If you are on year 10 and your trains are in shit condition, why replace them? Wait for the franchise to expire, and don't re-bid. Make it someone elses problem.

- Cost of multiple companies doing business; having so many companies interacting, sharing standard tickets, sharing facilities creates a massive overhead which simply adds to the cost. Having to do all the background IT work and accounting work so sort out that mess is costly.

- Profit making; if the goal is profit making, then simply put, there is an extra cost on every ticket to help pay for that profit. Without it, we either have cheaper tickets or more money available for direct investment.

Those 5 problems combined result in a system that is so unfit for purpose, I still can't believe it ever got put in place. Like I said, lets call a spade a spade, the whole thing was corrupt. Someone made a shitload of money somewhere, because this certainly wasn't done because it makes sense. It's pretty much the worst privatisation scheme possible.

EDIT: 6th major problem - costs of franchising process. The bid handling process, the cost of changing liveries etc is all wasted money.

EDIT: 7th major problem - fines and punishments for missing service level agreements are just passed on to the customer indirectly.",0,1382099597,null,0,1382099956,0,ccu9upr,t3_1opacw,t1_ccu9upr,t1_ccu9m6u,null,1429087481,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The Intercity Express programme seems to be a textbook idea of how not to do it - the government decides what train it will be, who will make it, and then they will force them on the train companies. 

It isn't just a case of buying a train, they're making the winner (Hitachi) build a UK assembly line for them which only increases the delay and adds to the cost. It has taken them years to sign a contract - under the original timeframe we should have been seeing new trains by now.

I struggle to see what is so fundamentally complex that has caused several years of delay - given that the freight train companies seem to have no idea procuring what they want. Other transport methods like the bus companies also seem to buy new buses as and when they want with no hassle.

It's the same for anything. The minister for defence should be trying to get the most they can for defence, etc. They all fight it out and things get allocated.

true,Jazzspasm,cnty-expat,"Expat - Yorskshire, then London, currently the Colonies","The important thing to remember is that nobody has ever experienced winter before. This is all important advice, making people aware that in winter it gets cold and an extra layer or two might be needed. 

Poor people will never have thought of turning the heating down and throwing on a wooly jumper, you see? 

Poor people don't think creatively. Breeding is part of the problem of course and probably why poor people are poor. That and because they make bad life decisions, so it's their own fault and while frankly it's tiresome having to pay to support them, we have to remember that we're all in this together.

Here on the Jazzspasm Palace Estate, seat to my family for twenty generations, we don't use the north wing of the main house during the colder winter months as a way to cut down bills and I personally think that poor people should think the same way. Just don't heat the parts of the house you don't use. Simple ideas but proof that we're all in this together. Marvellous.

Try not going on expensive holidays, too. Go and sit in the park, instead. There are some jolly nice parks in London and our nanny often takes Pubert, Hillary and Gretchen for long walks around the grounds of the estate. We only went skiing twice last season, so I really do understand what it's like to go without. Really, I do.

And there's nothing wrong with charity unless you ask for it, of course. Graciously accept what you're offered and asking for more is most unseemly. When my father used to let me sit on his knee as we rode around the estate, visiting the farmers and those ugly, smelly chaps that look after our horses, we would give them a piece of coal on Christmas Day and they always said thank you. Marvellous.

Also, use less of what you can't pay for. For example, eat less food if you're struggling to afford to eat. Can't pay the water bills? Stop using water, of course. There's plenty of that stuff in the rivers and why not start a fire and melt some of that snow after the kids have played with it? Marvellous fun.

Remember to save money on top of keeping your pension well stocked up with five or six thousand pounds each month. And invest in some start up businesses, something to do with technology is always quite good fun or maybe buy some property that you can rent out to other poor people. You've probably got quite a portfolio already, but just add to it. Or transfer money from the capital bonds markets into commodities throughout the winter months. My money's doing quite well in oil and gas these days (nod, wink).

This is good for the nation, its what people want and we're all in it together. Marvellous.

So, just to recap, try wearing a pullover, don't turn the heating on, stop being poor, make better investments and stop asking for things. Jolly good.

I do find it bizarre why we insist on playing fair when the rest of the EU just engineers things so that their home grown industry gets most of the work - and when it comes to acquisitions we jump at the chance to let a foreign company buy anything it wants.

There is this thing in population demographics called a [demographic transition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition). If you have an average of 6+ children per couple, then yes, you have some spares who can do the looking-after-mom-and-dad-in-their-dotage thing. (Especially as a pre-DT3 society typically has poor medical provisions and relatively few old folks will survive to that age.) But in a society that has turned the corner to demographic transition phase 4 or 5, you typically have 1-3 kids per couple. At which point, who's going to give up their job?

It can be worse, of course. I'm one of three children. One of us is currently spending a lot of time looking after two 80-something parents. But only one of us had any kids, so the next generation is going to see two children and up to *six* elderlies (three couples).

Next up: housing. We in the UK have roughly 35-40% the floor space per home per unit value compared to the US or Australia; only 70% the accommodation space of our European neighbours. Housing in the UK is *bloody expensive*. Adding a bedroom costs, on average, about £50,000 to the value of a property outside London (inside London: don't even ask). Most people -- families or individuals -- simply can't afford to lose 20 hours a week to caring *and* pony up that much money for the extra accommodation.
