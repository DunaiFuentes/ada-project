true,sue-dough-nim,eng-buckinhamshire,"Bongo Bongo Land, in Bucks","I think this is good, but I think the expertise and stability the House of Lords brings is also necessary. Pure democracy doesn't work if [voters aren't informed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html).

Then again, many people in the House of Lords are bishops, many others have inherited their peerage and don't have any qualifications particular to governing a country.

The UK system is over 1000 years old, many laws are cryptic, ancient, and written in different languages; and I think large parts of it need to be done away with.  The system of nobility and monarchy is one of them, but most British people would probably disagree with me.

edit: [Delegative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy) (a.k.a. Liquid democracy) might be a compromise - a system where, for instance, if you are not informed on a topic like education, and the country is voting on a bill which would change a lot about it, you can delegate your vote to someone else who has similar political opinions as you. It's 'liquid' because it's like representative democracy, but people don't get elected for representation, you select them as you go (edit4: on a per-topic basis - so for education you can delegate your vote to a teacher). Ideal in combination with [the technology](http://liquidfeedback.org/) we have today.

So is targeting specific people. If there is intel suggesting a certain person may be up to something, by all means GCHQ should have access to their info- after getting appropriate legal permission. It's the mass collection of everybody's data that we should be upset about.

true,nycsurfer,num22,,"I think the key here is having two wingers that can play on either side.  Think about all the times that Bale and Lennon started off on the left/right, respectively.  They worked wide and provided crosses.  If they were being marked or the crosses weren't working, the switched sides, on a dime.  Instantly, they were on the other side, which tripped up defenders and allowed them (read: Bale) to cut in on his left to shoot, essentially tripling the goal scoring threat.  Lately, Siggy on the left and Townsend on the right can't allow that flow to occur.  Lamela and Townsend, though, can and hopefully will.  

With that said, I think the midfield here will be Eriksen to slot in a pass to Soldado.  But behind Eriksen I would like to see Paulinho/Holtby/Dembele act as the main distributor.  They pick out the wings or Eriksen OR have a killer pass up to Soldado himself.  Finally, Sandro/Capoue hold the line and help Kaboul/Daws and Vert/Chiriches.

Because you want to live here as a family and government immigration rules for non-EU citizens require a sponsor with a minimum income level.

&gt; If you don't have anything nice to say why say it.

What you mean is you don't want to hear anything which doesn't fit into your perfect view as victim.

&gt; Your wife worked when your two children were babies, did she want to? Would she have done if she had the choice??

Yes she wanted to, yes she had the choice not to.

&gt; why are you even commenting, this has nothing to do with you does it? 

Since your brother decided to post it as a news story and you decided to come here to comment about it, you're the ones who decided to bring other people into it.

If you didn't want people with opposite views to have anything to do with it you should have kept it private and not plastered it all over Reddit.

&gt; Of course not, my husband can support us easily with his work, why leave my baby and out him in care when it is not necessary??

Because you want him to come and live in a country that has a requirement for immigrants from outside of the EU and the only way that is going to happen is by meeting the requirements.

true,AimHere,null,null,"&gt;The Spanish didn't get there first 

I don't give a toss about anyone's nationalism, and it doesn't matter who got where first, if they didn't stay there.. The Spanish settlers who were evicted in 1833 didn't obtain the islands by evicting the previous inhabitants. The British did.

There were prior colonists, but they'd abandoned the colony for one reason or another. As far as I'm concerned, taking over an empty or abandoned settlement isn't a crime against anyone. The initiation or threat of force is.

&gt;Spanish settlers backed by ships from Spanish Argentina then evicted the British at port Egmont

Sure, that was criminal, and that would have put the Spaniards in the reverse position if it was the origin of the current settlement. But trouble is, you're omitting the fact that the British reestablished that colony, and then abandoned it, which somewhat negates any claim they had to it. This was all 60 years before the British retook the recolonised islands by force, which you omit to mention too.

The legalities of the seizure of the American ships is disputed; as is the nature of the eviction of the colonists in 1833. They certainly didn't leave voluntarily. 

&gt;Look what happened to Georgia that would be much of eastern Europe if no one was keeping some degree of check on the russians. The strong do as the will generally 

You're deluded if you think there was ever any danger of NATO effectively intervening as regards the Russia/Georgia war; the only influence they had was inadvertantly providing the precedent that allowed Russia to justify the attack in the first place.

Until 1999, Kosovo was Serbian territory inhabited by ethnic Albanians who wanted independence, and NATO came along and helped them get it by bombing Serbia (after imposing a completely specious ultimatum), followed by occupying it.

South Ossetia was Georgian territory inhabited by pro-Russian Ossetians who wanted independence, and Russia came along and helped them get more independence, by attacking Georgia; or anyrate by stationing troops inside Ossetian territory. Georgia responded with a military assault, which the Russians were prepared for.

This parallel was certainly not lost on the Russians at the time; they repeatedly invoked the precedent when justifying it to the world. It might even have given the Russians the idea in the first place.

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"If terrorists are even going to use the internet to communicate at *all*, they'll use TOR or they'll use other encrypted networks - and even then, it'll be code words. They're not going to be using Skype or Gmail emailing each other back and forth like ""lolol yeah gonna bomb Buckingham Palace on Tuesday"". But most terrorists aren't going to be using the internet to communicate because they *know* they'll get caught that way. So they'll stick to more traditional methods of communication that are harder (if not impossible) to trace.

As for paedophiles, many paedophile rings operate on a person to person passing video tapes around kind of basis. But any child porn you find on TOR could be traced back to specific people if good old fashioned detective work was used. I'm all for that. I think the producers of child pornography should be the #1 priority if you're going to cyber police encrypted networks.

I'm not a terrorist or a paedophile but just thinking about it for a couple of seconds, were I either of those things, would I really want to take the risk of using the internet to conduct my nefarious activities unless I was a moron?

I'm not going to say no online surveillance should take place at *all*, of course it should, but lines should be drawn and our privacy should be protected. On the other hand I doubt somebody from GCHQ is sitting there reading the Skype conversations between me and my boyfriend or poking around in my emails... so I dunno. I just want these powers to be used for the right reasons. To *protect* the public not from imaginary terrorist boogeymen but from actual dangerous people, whether they be paedophiles or murderers or whatever. I know terrorists exist, but I also don't think they're as common as the media would have us believe. Otherwise why would they make the news?

This guy uses the needle in a haystack analogy, but he isn't specifying the methods they're using to identify the needles (or needle fragments). Are they filtering specific words and if so, how specific? If I use the word ""bomb"" in a conversation will I show up on their radar?

That's a common misconception about British law.  Murder does not require premeditation.  It only requires intent to cause GBH or death.  Clearly she intended to cause serious harm to the Sikh gentleman, and can be charged with murder.  However, her defence counsel could potentially argue ""loss of control"" in order to get it reduced to voluntary manslaughter, which would mean they'd need to demonstrate that she felt ""seriously wronged"" (in the wording of the law), by her chest being brushed, even if accidentally, by the victim.

That's your interpretation and theirs too, but it's not mine. Here's what they said once in the Guardian:

&gt; ""There is nothing in our appeal or campaigning which supports, or does not support, war: we are totally neutral. We are not a warmongering organisation. We don't have a position on war in Iraq or anywhere else. **These boys don't send themselves to Iraq – that's a decision for the politicians.**

That's something I would disagree with. Nobody was conscripted into fighting in Iraq.

&gt; ""We help 160,000 cases a year, servicemen and women and their families. We represent widows at inquests, we fight for compensation for victims who have lost limbs. We are in there, up to our elbows dealing with the cost of conflict.""

I think the White Poppy site says it best:

&gt; The Legion criticised the government for the often appalling way the it treats its employees in the armed forces but it never criticises the decision which lead to the death, injury or mental instability of the people it wishes to support.

## 

&gt; The Legion describes itself as the 'nation's de facto custodian of Remembrance, ensuring that people remember those who have given their lives for the freedom we enjoy' .... It is also simplistic and questionable whether those who 'have given their lives' did so 'for the freedom we enjoy'.

To me this last point is the most salient.

The training would probably be better than what you could expect from an off-the-shelf qualification from the same education suppliers as the big company can have it tailored to their needs, whereas the smaller company can not.

In essence, there's a lot of factors in the costings.

Don't worry, I know a lot of people who gave up with computers, IT, etc. as it really isn't what they expected. If you can impress in a company, then they may put you on to the graduate scheme at a later date, but again it's a case of getting the foot in the door, or who you know that matters.

All I can suggest is apply for some of these graduate schemes if they don't explicitly say you have to have a certain grade, recruiters look more for who will fit in with their ethos and their team more so over the grades you received.

Call your landlord and see if you can get some more time to scrape your rent together, do oddjobs for cash in hand?

true,davedubya,flair5,,"A few thoughts from the North Stand:

- Spurs won. But from the attitude of quite a few supporters I heard, it seemed as though Spurs had lost. Those supporters need to buck their ideas up.

- The first half was not all that good. Whatever it was Spurs were trying to do, it just was not working. 

- The second half, for the most part, they turned it around. You could clearly see what they were trying to do and it worked. 

- It's not until Eriksen was subbed off that you realised just how much he dominates the midfield and how many opportunities he creates. I would have preferred to see Eriksen get a full game and to see how he, Holtby and Kane would have linked up.

- Dembele and Vertonghen are ridiculously consistent and professional.

- Defensively solid yet again.

- I watched Lamela quite a bit (as I think a lot of people were). In the first half, he didn't look too settled and it seemed as though he wasn't entirely sure what his role was supposed to be. In the second half, he was far more attuned with the team and showed more confidence. That gradually allowed to show his stuff and dominate the attack and win the game. Once he scored it was amazing to watch. He needs to now play a whole game at the weekend. I can see him and Soldado being a good partnership.

- If I'm honest, I thought Lamela deserved to take the penalty.

- The crowd atmosphere was pretty good I thought.

&gt;I think [the idea of using the Internet to vote on individual bills] is good, but I think the expertise and stability the House of Lords brings is also necessary. Pure democracy doesn't work if [voters aren't informed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html).

&gt;Then again, many people in the House of Lords are bishops, many others have inherited their peerage and don't have any qualifications particular to governing a country.

&gt;[...]

&gt;[Delegative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy) (a.k.a. Liquid democracy) might be a compromise - a system where, for instance, if you are not informed on a topic like education, and the country is voting on a bill which would change a lot about it, you can delegate your vote to someone else who has similar political opinions as you. It's 'liquid' because it's like representative democracy, but people don't get elected for representation, you select them as you go, on a per-topic basis - so for education you can delegate your vote to a teacher. Ideal in combination with [the technology](http://liquidfeedback.org/) we have today.

&gt;Also noteworthy: Liquid Democracy is a system advocated by some European Pirate Parties.

I would completly disagree. He has lost the ball countless times as the last midfielder which has lead to teams counter attacking us both costing us and almost costing us a goal. You dont have to look to far for an example, last game vs Schalke in the somewhat early minutes he gave the ball straight away in our half as last mid to one of their front men and they counter attacked us, and luckily the player who ended put taking the shot just nearly missed but he would have had Cech beaten and had us a goal down had he put it on target. Things like this is what separate the top CDMs to just average ones in my view. Things like this hardly occur to Pirlo or Xabi Alonso and even Sergio Busquets.

Edit: Also, his distribution is mostly limited to passing back to our defenders and sometimes his partner center midfield player. He doesnt give you that playmaking ability from deep that you will see from the other CMs I listed (Pirlo, Xavi, Xabi Alonso, Modric) these guys distribute the ball all over the pitch at quick paces running the strings for their team. Unfortunately Mikel never seems to have that eye for that perfect switch, or drilled ball into the feet of an attacking midfielder. He always plays the safe and easy option, while their isn't anything necessarily *wrong* with that, you cannot call him a very good distributor because of it.",0,1383881906,null,0,1383882206,0,cd9dyth,t3_1q4i9b,t1_cd9dyth,t1_cd9dsn6,null,1428746313,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1

true,RandomPotato,null,null,"I obviously disagree with your disagree. I think the whole team was pretty shit right out of the gate against Schalke, and after they settled in I personally can't remember any mistakes after that. He is usually very consistent, just look to the rest of the game (unless I'm forgetting something, which is a strong possibility). 

Furthermore, I personally think there are almost two types of CDM. There is the Mikel type, who is usually a rock in defense (he also doesn't just play back passes, he has pretty good vision. He just always takes the safer option, which, I personally would rather have). And then there are the Pirlo types, who play as a deep lying playmaker. Admitedly, Mikel is nowhere near as good as delivering slicing long balls through the defense, but I don't think that's really his job either. I'd rather have him focus on shutting down the opposing sides attack.

I suppose this just boils down to us having two different views of what our CDM should do. As you said, Mikel always plays it safe, and I actually think that makes him a good distributor. Maybe a better term would be 'redistributor'? As in, he keeps the attacking play alive by keeping possession? I really don't know what I'm trying to say, I guess, sorry.

Edit: I think I remember reading somewhere on here that Mikel never plays the key pass, but he often plays the pass *before* the key pass, and I think that's what I was trying to say earlier. Sorry for being unclear.  
Edit2: Providing sources where they're due, I think [this](http://plainsofalmeria.co.uk/2013/11/07/back-to-basics-mourinhos-balancing-act/) is where I got that statement on Mikel from. In case anybody was curious.

Of all the guys you mentioned, only Busquets is comparable to Mikel. Put Pirlo or Xavi in the same role as Mikel and your midfield your midfield would get bullied.

Against Schalke, everyone had a poor start of 10-15 minutes. After that, Mikel was solid, what you needed as a midfielder.

Arsenal, Essien and Mikel just bossed the midfield. Couldn't be touched.

Little has been was said about how important Mikel was against City. At the start of the second half, Chelsea was starting to get pushed around the midfield and conceded a goal. Mikel comes in and changed the dynamics of that match. He took control of that midfield.

While obviously, there are better DMs than Mikel, ie Martinez, De Rossi, Busquets, Khedira, Maschesrano, etc... you can do a lot worse than Mikel. 

If you are looking for a play making DM, you have to change Ramires, not the 'other' dm. A Ramires-play making DM gives you the same result as a Ramires-Lampard pairing.

Besides this they also carry out lots of day-to-day non-social functions in their community, as /u/listyraesder described.

In terms of composition, each *ward* (which is a local neighbourhood of a few thousand residents) will vote every few years for a local councillor (in some cases more than one) to represent them on the council. So the political makeup of the council can vary over time -- however the elected councillors only control the overall strategy of the council, obviously there are thousands of employees of each council who carry out the work to be done regardless of which party is in charge.

2) define undemocratic actions

3) define true democracy

4) Why should we help you pass YOUR citizenship essay?

Firstly I really don't understand what you mean by the first, possibly interventions in other countries? Google that.

&gt;Is Britain a true democracy?

This is something you should be able to answer unless it's yes or no in which case you should ask for clarification on the question.

In case you can't answer that (This is an essay for your citizenship right? Really this is something you should know, it's something I'd expect anyone with a even tiny interest about the country to know)

The answer is a grey area, we live in a democracy and have done for hundreds of years (AFAIK) but we also don't, we have a **monarch** who is the head of state (Glorious **Queen Elizabeth II**) who you should love with all your heart. She does not interfere with politics and neither does the rest of the **royal family**, she merely passes into law whatever **parliament** tells her to (We'll get to this in a second) and if she doesn't she'll be removed from power (She's a figurehead) the** royal family** are generally approved of or ignored.

The **Queen** and the **royal family** are not elected.

The **House of Lords** they act as a check on the **House of Commons**(We'll get back to this) they have the power to send a law back to the **House of Commons** 3 times and no more, while doing this they can ask for additions or reductions after 3 times the law will be sent to the **Queen** regardless, so they only have the power to slow down laws. They're a check on society and mostly made up of the Church of England and the number of **Lords** is being reduced.

Lastly there's the **House of Commons**, made of **Members of Parliament** (MPs) who you vote for and fall into parties such as Labour (Left), the Liberal Democrats (Center left) and the Conservatives (Right) you vote for them, they the make laws and are the only ones with power real power compared to the US system they would be equal to senators.

Each party chooses one spokes person, the party with the most votes gets into power and governs how they see fit, the spokesperson for the current party in power is called the **prime minister** (PM).

Every 5 years while votes are going on democracy is suspended entirely and we return to a complete **Monarchy** in name and government is suspended, while suspended the **Queen** has total power (Although as we've established if she used it she'd be removed, well this has never been tried so would probably be used for something extreme rather than passing a treaty with a country we're friendly with) until we the voters have decided on a party that best represents our interests as a country.

This happens in two stages, there's the local elections where you choose your local MP to represent your county in government and the general elections where you choose which party should represent the country. The more votes = the more MPs of that party in government, the party with the most MPs runs the country. (I'm a bit fuzzy here) 

Government is only dissolved while the general elections go on.

As you can see it's a bit complex as to whether we're a true democracy, which is why I want you to clarify. 

Anyway, research this a bit more and once you have citizenship (good luck) visit West minister and the Houses of Parliament.

Going through your university you can get emergency funds, but in my experience they will rarely give you more than £100, £50 was even stretching it when I asked (and it was their fault that I needed the funds as my loan was late so they were being extra nice to me). You have to prove that you basically need severe medical treatment that will somehow cost you money, or you need to get back to the states because your parents died and your house burnt down, or some other highly improbably situation for them to loan you more than £100. edit: I just did some research at my own university and they won't give out more than £200 regardless of your situation, repayment is usually within 2-4 weeks after receiving the first payment (if there's more than one), but interest is usually very low.

Getting a credit card will be your best bet. It won't be easy or fun to pay it back, but that's life. See if your UK bank account will open one up for you, unless you're in overdraft or have bad credit (but you're a student so I'm assuming you're too young to have bad credit already) you should be eligible.

If I may, you would have £550 leftover each month. Assuming you spend £50/week on groceries (which is a lot for one person), you'd still have £350 leftover. What are you spending that much money on? I can see £100ish on 'clubbing' and partying with friends, but otherwise not much else.

true,keithb,null,null,"&gt;* (Doctor Who) Rose Tyler lives in a ""council estate.""

Councils build and manage social housing. For a while in the past they built and managed *all* social housing, not so much these days—Rose probably really lives in a building owned and managed by a Housing Association but of a vintage that it was originally built by her local borough council and everyone still calls it a “council flat”

&gt;* (Undercover Boss UK) A gentleman went undercover working four the council and did a few things like helping people with what appeared to be getting on welfare?

Councils administer some benefits, such as Housing Benefit (help with your rent), the rather circular Council Tax Benefit and various kinds of short–term, local, urgent–need benefits. Councils are not supposed to allow anyone who lives in their borough to become destitute. Some councils care more about this than others.

&gt;* (Black Books) At one point Bernard is irritated about construction in his neighborhood and threatens to write a letter to the council.

Councils administer planning and zoning restrictions, which can be quite draconian (and can be very lax, depending), they also control environmental health at a local level.

&gt;* (The Catherine Tate Show) Her Nan character complains that the council is incompetent since the guy who cleans her windows is late.

Nan is in social housing (see above). Again, she's probably really complaining about the Housing Association but will be of an age that she still thinks of “the Council” as her landlord.

&gt;are they a legislative body for the community?

In the usual British style they are a legislative body (they can pass “by–laws” which apply only in their borough) from which an executive is drawn.

&gt;What size of community do they typically serve? 

Varies enormously: a big city Council could represent a million people, a small (or sparsely populated) county only a few tens of thousands. See [a list of English districts by population here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_districts_by_population).

true,NervousEnergy,null,null,"I work for the City of York Council, so I might be able to shed some light on the complex nature of councils. CYC is a unitary authority, which is slightly different from County Councils and Town Councils. We have jurisdiction over all local services within the City of York boundary (including suburb villages). This is over 200,000 people. The direct Government level up from us is Central Government in London. There are a number of Parish Councils within York (holdovers from when the churches had political control in villages and towns, and the city is divided into Parishes, but these have little political control and are mainly civil institutions.  

Where I used to live, my school driveway wasn't snow gritted for a week because the Town Council said it was the responsibility of the County Council and the County Council said it was the responsibility of the Town Council. That sort of jurisdiction confusion doesn't happen with us.

CYC employs nearly 8000 people, which includes all the teachers for the Primary and Secondary schools in York (we also have control over the schools, but don't actually set the curriculum. That's Central Government).

The political structure of the Unitary Authority can be slightly confusing. The city is divided into wards, with each ward electing every five years (separate from National Elections) one or more counsellors. The counsellors are usually part of the national political parties (The Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, etc), and so counsellors do tend to tred the Party Line. However, being counsellors, they often have much more leeway to be flexible. The party which won the majority of ward seats in the last council election has overall political control of the council. There is also a Leader of the Council (which mirrors the Prime Minister), and even a cabinet made up of counsellors. The cabinet has roles like Cabinet Member for Finance, Performance and Customer Service, and Cabinet Member for Health, Housing and Adult Social Services. Weirdly, York also has a Mayor, who is unelected and who changes each year. The Mayororal candidate is drawn from the counsellors, so you can be a Mayor and a counsellor at the same time. The Mayor has zero political power, and is purely ceremonial. They host functions and are more an ambassador of the city. This is much the same for most Mayors in the UK, the obvious exception being the Mayor of London who has political power.

However the counsellors don't actually run the council. They influence policy, and try to (in theory) represent the population of their respective wards, and are great scapegoats when things go wrong, but the real people in charge are the Directors and Chief Executive. These are unpolitical roles, and the people are almost like CEO's of companies. The Council is split up into Directorates (..separate from the Cabinet jurisdictions, to make things more confusing), and these Directorates really run the various services the Council provides. Directorates include Public Health and Well-being, Communities and Neighbourhoods, and Adults, Children and Education. 
 

Within each Directorate are various Departments and Teams. To give you an idea of the types of things the Council does, here are just a few:

Public Health: run the swimming pools, runs the sports centres, funds sports clubs, helps fund the stadium, pays for emergency contraception, tries to reduce drug and alcohol addiction, and runs schemes to improve the health of the city.

Youth Offending Team: works with the police to help kids who are in trouble.

Housing: helps run various social housing throughout the city, helps with people in arrears, tries to cut down on homelessness.

Transport: can enact road tolls, can restrict traffic, administrates road maintenance, creates bike paths, runs and funds the Park &amp; Rides, interfaces with the bus companies and train companies to create a more unified transport network, operates the car parks, and enforces traffic fines. 

Refuse: the council operates and runs the recycling centres, the rubbish trucks, and provides refuse collection for the city.

Libraries and Archives: runs all the libraries in York.

Children's Services: runs the schools, deals with child abuse.

Planning and Building Control: all planning applications goes through the Council. 

City Development: long term future of the city, runs the festivals, tries to increase tourism, etc.

The Council is also very much a business, and has the usual legal, finance, and human resources teams. 

The main way the Council makes money is through grants from Central Government and Council Tax. Everyone but the poorest pays Council Tax, and the rate is determined on the value of your home. Council tax money is meant to pay for city services, such as roadworks and development. There are also various pots of money the council can dip into, either regional funds or development funds from the EU for instance.

For example, interview notes, shortlisting records, related emails. Recruitment is exempt from the Act. 

They can make a small charge for this information (up to £10) and then have 40 days to send it to you. They can't say they don't have information (they must have kept some records) or claim they have destroyed the records (they're required to keep them for a set period.)

I have used this several times to offer the recruiter the opportunity to give me constructive feedback after interview (if I didn't make the shortlist, I wouldn't bother) as a way of avoiding the more expensive, onerous (and possibly embarrassing for them) legal requirement of sending me the results of the subject access request.

Clegg debates with Paxman about our democracy. One on one. Get some of the ins and out discussed.

Some one who'll play the game responsibly, generally votes (and as he said hasn't once but feels bad) who obviously understands the system, but see the flaws and how and why people aren't engaged in the system.

With someone who's part of the system, who's party has been kept down by it's design, but now has had the chance through luck as much as everything else to be part of the government. This meant that MP's were whipped against fulfilling personal pledges. (For instance “I pledge to vote against any increase in fees in the next parliament and to pressure the government to introduce a fairer alternative.” was signed by their MP's. Only 21 of 57 lib dems fulfilled their pledge. The other chose their party whip over their pledge to their constituancy that voted them in.) Who campaigned for electoral reform but a pretend version which would fix only one of the many problems. 

Discuss how people should vote, whether we should have to tactical vote, why votes count differently in different areas and what could be done about this. How people in very safe seats should engage politically. (For instance I live in Middlesbrough, it's so safely labour it's stupid. The second place party is also to my distaste (UKIP) as is (now) the third place (LibDem) and fourth place (Tory), I'm left voting for weird independents. I'm not sure what that achieves over spoiling my vote, and I'm not sure what that achieves over not turning up.
Once the Labour MP is inevitably returned, my main voice becomes writing to this guy, who I didn't vote for, I'll never vote for, it doesn't matter if i vote for or not in the future. If i write to him he'll read it maybe take it on board, and ignore it in favour of the party line. Even if  I can somehow influence this guy, it's unlikely to affect labour party policy, even if it does, it's the other guys who make the policy anyway. 

So I have no voice in an election, for a guy who has no voice, in a party who has no voice in the current government. And people wonder why i might feel disenfranchised.

Someone with a respected voice, who actually sees the problem, with the chance to put some of these points (in something more than a four minute interview covering three different topics as media interview normally are), to the one guy in power who might actually concede some of the points rather than politicking and saying ""everything is fine, we had a referendum, everything is fine, the people rejected it, everything is fine.""",0,1383903522,null,0,false,0,cd9jx7w,t3_1q3ksx,t1_cd9jx7w,t3_1q3ksx,null,1428743523,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Yes. From an industrial perspective, the yard in Portsmouth was generally considered to make more sense to keep open (hence why the unions are getting involved) than two yards on the Clyde - so the only obvious explanation, at least from the perspective down here, is political rather than economic.

&gt; Has the news about the shipyards knocked the stuffing out of Portsmouth

Back in the 1970s Portsmouth was a massive industrial hub - but 30 years of decline in the Royal Navy and British shipbuilding generally turned Portsmouth and the surrounding predominantly working-class areas like Gosport and Fareham into very unhappy places. Whenever I hear people talk about a ""north south divide"" I'd challenge them to go to Portsmouth and tell me it didn't rival many of the poorest places in the north...

**BUT** - over the last 10 years there has been a lot of redevelopment gone into the area with places like the Spinnaker tower exemplifying that. At this point I don't think this has ""knocked the stuffing"" out of Portsmouth, and after all the home of the two new carriers will be Portsmouth and the dockside is being redeveloped and extended to accommodate the extra tonnage. The city has already gone some way to diversifying its industrial base but the bottom line remains that this feels like an injustice to many people.

At the same time though, there is also a general feeling that this is probably the dieing breath of something that actually started to die 30 years ago - in so much as military shipbuilding has decline enormously. There is now a lot of focus in the area on shifting towards commercial shipping.

&gt; how are things in the city generally

You touch on a good point here really. Southampton and Portsmouth are the most densely populated area outside of London believe it or not. About 1-1.5 million people live in and around the two cities (which virtually extend into each other) but they tend to get dwarfed by bigger (London) or more exciting (Brighton/Bournemouth) parts of the south. It's a shame because as I alluded to above, these two places really challenge the idea of a straightforward north-south divide.

To answer your question though, generally things are much better than they were 10-15 years ago and there is a sense that in many ways the city is ""on the mend"". People are keen to avoid it turning into a museum city though, like some other industrial cities have become. For the most part though the city exemplifies the huge divide between wealth and poverty in the southeast, as it always has done.",0,1383905484,null,0,1383905924,0,cd9k73e,t3_1q6291,t1_cd9k73e,t3_1q6291,null,1428743394,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

However, residential prices since [around 2006](http://www.detini.gov.uk/2050_main_report_-_final_version.pdf) have been greater than 10p / kWh.

That means that at most [40%](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2850+EUR+per+MWh%29+%2F+%28%C2%A30.1+per+kWh%29) of our current electricity bills actually go on electricity.

**Clarification** Just in case: These are basically figures pulled out of a cursory google/my ass, but the impression is that 40% was *the good times* and that that proportion has been dropping since 2006.

It doesn't matter whether I stab you with a piece of flint or knife with a fully featured smartphone in the handle, you still stabbed someone  with it. If you don't want to have your knife confiscated try not stabbing people with it. 

&gt;Really?

there are about 20 knives in my kitchen and I don't think I've ever cut myself on any, so probably not. On the other hand I *have* electrocuted myself on a PSU, so are computers inherently dangerous because of that?

Octachaz in the ""Biggest Rivals"" thread

&gt;It all came to a head in the 1970 FA cup final, which is known as the dirtiest cup final ever played. Look it up if you can, both teams were trying to kick lumps out of each other.

_
&gt;No worries. If it helps solidify how ridiculous the two games were (the final was a draw, which meant it had to go to a replay), a modern referee looked at the second match and concluded that if it were played today, there would have been twenty yellow cards and six reds between the teams. On the day, one yellow was given. I've heard the quote 'It appeared the referee would only award a free kick on production of a death certificate' in reference to that game.

- Democratic Deficit: many people believe that the EU imposes too many laws and regulations without having proper democratic representation. The Commission (i.e. the executive) is thought of as having too much power, and the directly-elected Parliament too little.

- the EU has over-extended its original mandate. Or, the reasons why the UK joined the EU in the early 1970s have been superceded by the EU taking on further powers in subsequent treaty amendments, without the British public having a say. It was sold to the British public as being a single market, but now has lots of powers in the social sphere as well.

- Immigration: A central facet of EU law is free movement of people, goods and services. This means that EU countries cannot refuse entry to anyone from another EU state, whether that be for holidays, work or emigration. With the EU being a strong economy, it attracts people from the rest of Europe. This can be a drain on British resources such as the welfare state and NHS, as well as keeping wages low because there is a much larger group of workers to choose from.

&gt;That 90 minutes just shows why virtually every football fan loves football so much.

&gt;A team, widely hated, goes to the home of one of the best club sides in world football. One of their centre backs gets injured early on, the other gets sent off, and then they go 2-0 down. An absolute tonking is almost nailed on.
&gt;
&gt;Then suddenly, a goal from nowhere gives them hope. What followed in the second half wasn't so much a team knocking on the door, but going at it with an axe and screaming ""Heeeeere's Johnny!"" Suddenly, a penalty. The best player in the world steps up...and misses!! Somehow, with a depleted back line, tiring legs, and facing a relentless onslaught from one of the greatest attacking teams ever seen, they hold firm. Neutrals see this, and slowly start to think ""they can do this."" These thoughts turn to support, cheering on the plucky underdog competing against impossible odds, and holding their own.
&gt;
&gt;Then, in added time, they break. It comes to their striker, a man vilified all season, a former great missing chance after chance, mocked by rival fans, a subject of derision. In one swing of his leg, he puts his side through to the final of the greatest cup competition in the World, beating the best team in the World. A price tag justified in one moment.

Bad blood leads to bad blood. Any insurgency will thrive on what they perceive to be aggressors committing war crimes. Every time we do this we convert more moderates to the other side.

War isn't simple. Most soldiers aren't simply rabid animals who enjoy killing (nor are the Afghanis), there's fair reasons why men who are brutalised and used as weapons of war can go this way. Conversely, it isn't just baddies versus goodies.

It's not that much different from Tulip bulbs. Sure they have some use, just like bitcoin. You can grow nice tulips out of them, just like you can make payments with bitcoin with less security, lower fees, and more anonymity than, say, using Paypal.

But most of the tulip price gains in late 1636 came from the fact that people buying them thought they will eventually find ""a bigger fool"" to off-load them to, at a price premium.

And most people I know who are buying Bitcoin do so for the same reason.

It is worth remembering that in such large organisations you don't just have 'the budget' every department may have multiple budgets (one for emergencies, one for normal things).   As is often the case there is only really oversight on one of them.

Because this is due to under-staffing the £700 can come from the emergency budget, thus that department can report is has spent less of its operational budget this year.  Which pleases the accountants and government. 

The other thing to consider is: How much is the negligence insurance if they wre fully staffed?  The answer is probably somewhere around.... £700 per birth.   But at full staffing levels it wouldn't come from the emergency budget and be much less of a news worthy story.

Most employers will have a disciplinary and dismissal procedure and it's a good idea to apply that to everyone and not just those who could claim unfair dismissal.

And it's wise to be careful about dismissing someone who doesn't have two years service, partly because it's someone's life you are dealing with but also to make sure the dismissal isn't discriminatory, for asserting a statutory right, etc.

Two, if we asked any of these writers if they were in favor of sweatshops, they would tell us they weren’t. By Martha Gill’s logic, instantly, everyone that works at The Telegraph is now a hypocrite.

It's a bit like the GOP in America, they hate government so they have an incentive to break it and then say ""I told you so"".

Norway has a great relationship with Europe but hasn't been threatening to come and go, and isn't as large and critical a partner. If Norway had been a major power in the EU, and agitated for years to leave, and then did, I seriously doubt they would have the same relationship.

The British Legion has an interesting history ideologically, particularly in the context of its formation in the immediate aftermath of WWI. It essentially absorbed the left leaning National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers which campaigned for war pensions etc (and excluded officers from membership) and the explicitly right-wing/nationalist counterparts. The slogan of the former was ""justice not charity."" The author himself clearly remembers something of that spirit from his childhood.

The popular memory of that war is epitomised by the likes of Wilfred Owen ""futility"" or Siegfried Sassoon's poem about the cenotaph which explicitly politicised remembrance. That wasn't necessarily new. George Orwell once famously observed that the most stirring British war poem is about a brigade of cavalry that charged the wrong way. 

The coexistence of that typically British gut anti-militarism with commemoration of wartime heroism / service of the British state / the armed forces has always been an uncomfortable one to say the least.

Each new conflict - and more importantly the popular perception of the conflict - changes the dynamic. From the troubles in Ireland, to the ""liberal intervention"" of the last few decades. In particular, current reverence for soldiers who have served in the Middle East is often co-existent with a real anger at the politicians who sent them to fight there.

The problem for people who are explicitly against poppies or the RBL is that the poppy is defined by the mass of people that wear it, rather than necessarily the history or the RBL or politicians/the media. That definition is complex - and not simply reducible to ""pro"" or ""anti"" war politics, either specific or general.

The most important issue around remembrance for me is not whether or not people wear poppies - but that people do remember, and critically. That we discuss our history, and ask what it means to us now, today.",0,1383917221,null,0,1383917975,0,cd9m1ud,t3_1q65sd,t1_cd9m1ud,t3_1q65sd,null,1428742529,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"Honestly, most tabloid articles are fake. People don't realise that none of this is 'meant' to be true in the strictest sense of the word. It's more like a massive creative writing assignment with weasel words used to transition between fact and wild speculation. Seriously, open up any of these shitrags and read a politics article, ESPECIALLY one about the EU or immigration. It'll start with a rather simple statement of fact (even though they use rather loaded words). Something like this: 

'The European Union announced in Brussels on Thursday a scheme to draw new regional boundaries for the redistribution of structural funds.'

There will be a couple of things wrong in that sentence, like the compulsory inclusion of the place as Brussels, the word 'scheme' instead of plan or programme, and the boldness of using a word like 'redistribution' instead of just 'distribution' to generate socialist overtones in the mind.

THEN, the **very next sentence** will start with some weasel segue like 'This could mean that/This may lead to/Some believe this paves the way for/Experts think that/', and this is of course followed by all the batshit speculation and four paragraphs of 'Hey Jim, what's the craziest shit you can think of that would scare people?' If challenged with claims that it's all utter bollocks, they'll point to all those conditional 'mights' and 'maybes' and 'could possiblies' in the segue that cover their arses.

Of course, that's not what most knuckle-draggers think who read this shit on a daily basis. They see the article for what it says, which would be something like:

'The European Union announced in Brussels on Thursday a scheme to draw new regional boundaries for the redistribution of structural funds, which could pave the way towards the creation of a new federal European superstate, *with Brussels as its capital, and London relegated to a minor capital of Region North-West VI*, according to sources.

The Prime Minister was reportedly shocked upon hearing of the scheme, which was not voted on or approved by European leaders. Speaking on BBC's *Newsnight*, Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: 'This is disastrous. Blair, Brown and all the previous Labour governments sold this country up the creek with no madate for this, turning over decisions over British interests to a bunch of unelected ivory tower bureaucrats in Brussels. But you can rest assured that me and my colleagues will be fighting this tooth-and-nail to stand up for Britain and tell these Eurocrats to take a hike!

[insert four more paragraphs with quotes from Boris Johnson, William Hague, Richard Littlejohn and some other random cunt]'

In other words, they'll take an innocuous story about a new regions drawn up for statistical data analysis reasons to determine the distribution of structural funds, and which have no bearing on politics at all, and spin it into this wild tale of Britain being carved up into Euroregions by Brussels in some sort of mentalist 'divide and conquer' dystopia. But what's even worse is that politicans (of BOTH parties, but especially the Tories) LOVE it when the press does this. They know there's no story, but they can parade some politicians about on the news for a few days, looking like caped crusaders who have swept in to rescue the nation from this awful EU injustice and make sure that it never happens again (even though nothing was ever happening in the first place).

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; It's not a direct association, no one is being that blatant.

right. so the poppy is not used to make pro-war arguments. 

&gt; n recent years they have changed the outlook and use words like ""hero"" routinely.

and I and many people have no problem using this word to describe the armed forces past and present. 

&gt; If you look at the modern conflicts covered in relation to the poppy appeals they always seek to justify the conflict in the press copy. 

none of these quotes attempt to justify modern conflicts. they express why individuals wear the poppy, and all refer to past conflicts also. 

&gt; ach justifies the war behind the injuries and losses as opposed to focusing only on helping those affected.

not true. none of them attempts to justify any war, they state very bland and uncontroversial points about the armed forces in general. armed forces are, unfortunately, a necessary part of any functioning free society, and obviously most people recognise that. that does not mean that supporting them equals support for any particular war. and most people can recognise that distinction.

I suggest you stay **away** from Union Street. It gets quite rowdy later into the evening. 

Apparently the show finishes at [2205] (http://www.plymouthpavilions.com/prod-productions_details.asp?pid=773) and if you don't mind a little walk, you can reach very nice parts of the city with no trouble whatsoever. 
If you want to check out the Barbican at night there are traditional style pubs with few students that you can have a good pint or five in relative peace after the show. There are [plenty](http://www.barbicanwaterfront.com/pubs-clubs/) to choose from. The Pavilions to the Barbican is about half a mile, but it is flat and straight. Once at the Barbican you can't really miss anything. After all, you are heading to the Barbican on Thursday and spending the majority of you time there so you could easily skip this.

If the Barbican is a little out of the way for the Wednesday night you could go home via The Brass Monkey. The only concern I have with this is that it is a [student night](http://www.thebrassmonkeyplymouth.co.uk/whats-on/). It's your call. 


On the other hand if you want to join in with the students I suggest you head to North Hill where you will find the student bars, clubs are around Union Street.

[This](http://goo.gl/maps/1By3a) is a map from Plymouth Pavilions to the Barbican and back to the Copthorne Hotel (the hotel is next to a Sainsbury's supermarket). 

[Here](http://goo.gl/maps/BrDmb) is one from the Pavilions to The Brass Monkey and back to the hotel. 

If you have the time you may want to visit the Hoe and [Smeaton's Lighthouse and look towards the horizon.](http://goo.gl/maps/Sui0u)

Accurate.

Vossen looks like he'd be a ""predator"" type striker though, which we've not really had since Yorke, imo. If we did lose Bentekkers and brought this guy in, our style of play would have to change dramatically. Most likely, Vossen would have to rely on Kozak's ability to hold up play, and we'd have to have much better midfield ball-retention.

I reckon if we had better midfield ball retention, we could probably combine any two or three of our forwards (depending on opposition) and have a pretty frightening potential for goals.

Also agree on Helenius. Obviously very technically gifted, but straight away it was clear he isn't physical enough to lead the line for Villa (in our current form at least).

Canas-JDG would be my automatic central partnership at the moment, but the inexplicable decision to loan out Ki when we've just added a dozen-plus games to our season in the shape of the Europa League just keeps coming back to haunt us. 

Vs Cardiff and in both games against KK, we could really have used Ki's (or even Kemy's) calm and solidity, but we had neither available.

The only thing I think he can improve right now is if he grows some balls and drops the big names in our squad when their form isn't so good (looking at Gerrard here). But then again, some players are treated differently than others and at LFC, Suarez and Gerrard can probably do anything they want and not get into trouble, which is ok as long as they perform.

If those people still posed a risk to society, why would they be released? If they do not, why are you treating them like criminals? The punishment is supposed to be the prison sentence, not to be mistreated on release.

&gt;Pretty sure my kitchen knives weren't made for stabbing, and they weren't made for cutting people.

I never said people. It's purpose *is* for cutting and stabbing. A computer isn't for hacking or w/e, it just can be used for that. Really the point is immaterial, because you're dodging the fact we legislate against the sale and use of knives *because* they're inherently dangerous.

&gt;Both are object that can be used either to commit non-violent (slashing tyres, financial crime) or violent (throwing it at someone, throwing it at someone) crime, or not used to commit crime at all. Everything is ""indeed quite dangerous"" if you use it wrong, and neither computers nor knives are if you use them right.

If computers are as dangerous as knives, why is their sale not as heavily restricted? Or their use? Because they're in no way equivocal. 

&gt;it's a sad indictment of human nature that you're so disconnected from the victims of crime you want to give the tools used to commit it back to criminals.

Again, treating people out of prison like they're horrific human beings is not a great aspect of society. They did the crime, they did the time (to borrow a phrase).

NO     Would Europe stop importing from Britain? We would have no special advantages over other non EU countries but that would not stop EU importer buying from us if we had something they wanted. 

- Would we have greater control over our sovereignty? WE would no longer be legally obliged to follow EU rules but we may have to adopt many of these anyway in order to be acceptable trading partners.

- What about joint defence forces, joint crime forces etc.? We could still be part of these as a Non-EU member but would likely have to accept compromises and constraints as part of any negotiated agrrement.

- And so it goes on

In short the losses from not being a Member are likely to be less than suggested because we don't live in isolation and other countries need to cooperate with us as much as we do with them. 

On the other hand the benefits to our freedoms and independence are likely to be less real and more illusory than many suggest.

I'll trade with the entity that brings me a combination of the best value for money and the most political clout. You are living in the idealistic land of pure economics - do you really think India's decision to abandon dealing with Britain and buy weapons from France was purely economic?

Come on, you know better than that, politics plays a bigger role in trade deals than tariffs do.

Making a trade deal worth billions of Euros with the EU; makes the EU, it's 27 (or 26 depending) member states and other partners nice and friendly to my country. Probably will get a few state visits, some further trade and investment talks with interested countries etc..

I'd rather deal with the entity which makes me more money in the long term - the one with a potential customer base of over 500 million trumps 65 million.

Nope, sour grapes normally refers to jealousy - the original fable which coined the phrase was specifically that the grapes couldn't be reached and were therefore called sour.

You are confusing it to think it means spite, it doesn't.

Unless you think the other members would be sour because they all want to leave the EU and have their own trade agreements; we know that's nonsense, so let's stick with the more accurate description I gave.

&gt;We have a trade deficit with Europe. It would hurt their economies more.

Yes, you have a trade deficit with Europe, all 26 other member states. If you leave, you lose all that trade in one huge chunk, those member states lose a little bit each, much more manageable - and not only that, but they have eachother to lift themselves out of it.

I don't see at all how you can argue that. They are literally saying that we are fighting for our ""freedom"". If that doesn't qualify as a justification for the wars themselves then I don't know what does. 

&gt; very bland and uncontroversial points about the armed forces in general.

Are you pulling my leg? The idea that we are ""fighting for freedom"" is highly controversial and is on very shaky grounds that doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny for almost all of our wars fought in the last 30 years.

&gt; or maybe the change has been in your opinions?

I don't think so but you'd need to dig out some old legion literature to be sure. I remember words like ""sacrifice"" being used regularly, urging us to ""remember those who served"" but never ""fight for freedom"" (linked earlier) or ""[support our heroes](http://www.poppyscotlandstore.com/)"", that's an more modern flag-waving mantra. In the past we viewed the lost and maimed as *victims* of war.

&gt;""Unlawful Act Manslaughter

&gt;""This is where the killing is the result of: 

&gt; * the defendant's unlawful act (not omission); 
&gt; * where the unlawful act is one which all sober and reasonable people would realise would subject the victim to the risk of some physical harm resulting there from, albeit not serious harm R v Williams and Davis (1992) 2 All ER 183; 
&gt; * whether or not the defendant realised this.
 //

So, you hit someone, but anyone would reasonably consider such a blow to cause physical harm, but not ""serious"" harm. That person later dies of complications.

There's no *mens rea* for murder, striking the person was unlawful but it's nonetheless manslaughter. Quoting the CPS again (ibid):

&gt;""with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (GBH)."" //

is an essential part of what constitutes murder as defined in English law.

[I accept this is not statute but the CPS know what they're talking about.]

What's more prevalent is a regulation or even advice being misinterpreted by the UK media and then propagated as a ridiculous edict coming down from upon high. The classic is the ""straight bananas"" rule, which actually doesn't exist.

A recent one was regarding the volume of water used in a flushing toilet. This was scaremongered by the UK media as a rule which must be adhered to, and was highly restrictive. In fact, it was actually a piece of consumer advice, not a rule, and merely stated a threshold for flush volumes below which a manufacturer could use a certain eco-friendly logo on their packaging. Manufacturers could still make less water-friendly toilets, there was no rule against that.

And the UK _already has_ more restrictive regulations regarding flushing anyway, which the news reports failed to mention. So the public is left with the impression that the EU is putting huge restrictions on our toilet manufacturers, whereas in fact the EU is merely trying to give more information to consumers, and the UK already has even more restrictive regulations!

The impact to Europe of Britain leaving would be minor, it won't sabotage the EU economy, and the economic rush which will take place to fill the gap will quickly balance the economy out again.

I can see them doing it, because they do not want the precedent to be set. It is different for Norway and Switzerland who were never members; they were able to negotiate because otherwise they weren't coming near the EU.

The EU will not want to allow a major member state to leave without being punished, as if they do, it could trigger a rush of rich nations leaving to look out for themselves. If Britain leaves, it will be punished, and as I outlined above, the idea that it can negotiate better trade deals by itself without the political clout of the EU is questionable at best.

But, even if a deal with the EU could be negotiated, the rules of that deal will be decided by the EU. The UK will no longer be a member of the EU and unable to influence those rules. The UK will be sitting beside one of the biggest power blocs on earth, with no influence whatsoever, but will be completely affected by decisions taken in it. Look at Switzerland and Norway who can not steer any EU policy, but are completely at the mercy of it.

Leaving the EU is the worst thing the UK could possibly do, politically and economically. The consequences will last potentially for decades, as even if it asks back in in 50 years, it will be treated as a junior member - there's no going back to the way things were once something this monumentally stupid is done.",0,1383928303,null,0,false,0,cd9prom,t3_1q5z11,t1_cd9prom,t1_cd9pf74,null,1428740673,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It's also not fine that somewhere called a Job centre run by an entity called the Department for WORK and Pensions is practically the most useless place to go for job hunting or advice on benefit entitlements.

You can now invest (its actually a bet) on a particular stock or index, like the FTSE.  If you think it will go up you pick Buy if you think it will go down you know pick Sell. You then choose a stake of £1 (during your trial period you can pick much smaller stakes). For every point the stock goes in the direction you chose you make £1. So you chose FTSE at £1 stake. The FTSE is at 6700 and you think it will go up because so economical data is coming out and you think its going to be better than expected. The FTSE rises to 6750 really quickly after the announcement. That's £50 profit so you cash out. You could have chosen to wait it out thinking it will increase more, but it turns out you're wrong. FTSE drops to 6740 so you think ""shit better cash out"" you make £40 instead. Alternatively you are completely wrong in thinking the FTSE will rise instead it drops to 6600. You're £100 down so you have two choices, do you think it will increase in which case you can lessen you loss or do you think it will continue to fall, in which case you want out and will cash out with £100 loss. The actual mechanics are slightly more complicated as each bet requires you hold a certain amount in your account. So the bet I described would require a £25 deposit. If the FTSE falls your deposit increases if your deposit increases to greater than the amount in your account then your bet should automatically close at whatever loss has accrued to that point. The maximum you could lose in the bet I described is £6700 as that is the FTSE at 6700 multiple by £1. So if the FTSE fell to 0 you would owe £6700.  The risks are huge but this type of investment (aka bet) is extremely interesting as it allows those with a small capital to invest in the stockmarket. So the bet I talked about would have required £6700 of capital to invest directly, instead of the £100 you have. 

The company (IGIndex) makes its money by applying a spread (say 1 point) so of the FTSE is at 6700 you actually Buy at 6699 and the FTSE has to rise 2 points for you to make a profit. The company makes that other pound.

TL;DR
Spread betting can be extremely risky. Don't do it of you don't understand the risk.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; I don't see at all how you can argue that. They are literally saying that we are fighting for our ""freedom"". If that doesn't qualify as a justification for the wars themselves then I don't know what does.

if ww2 doesn't count as a fight for freedom, I don't know what does. 

&gt; Are you pulling my leg? The idea that we are ""fighting for freedom"" is highly controversial and is on very shaky grounds that doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny for almost all of our wars fought in the last 30 years.

except they aren't talking exclusively about the past 30 years. also no one mentions fighting for freedom, rather ensuring our freedom. can you explain to me how our freedom would be ensured without armed forces?  do you know something that every country in the world doesn't? you seem to be coming from an extreme pacifist agenda here.

&gt; I don't think so but you'd need to dig out some old legion literature to be sure. I remember words like ""sacrifice"" being used regularly, urging us to ""remember those who served"" but never ""fight for freedom"" (linked earlier) or ""support our heroes"", that's an more modern flag-waving mantra.

well this is your contention, and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. just a quick glance at the [ode of remembrance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_of_Remembrance) and [in flanders fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Flanders_Fields) is much more pro war than the kind of things you've quoted. I find the idea that we have become more patriotic and nationalistic quite ludicrous. 

quite apart from your tenuous links and spurious assumptions, you are missing the wider and more important point about what the poppy actually is and does; which is support injured servicemen, ex-servicemen and stand up for their rights. wearing a poppy and paying for one does not commit you to a pro-war stance, any more than donating to a 9/11 victims charity would dedicate you to a pro-al-qaeda stance. wearing the poppy is for the majority a simple sign of remembering the dead and honouring their service. 

to suggest that it provides implied support or justification for war is an intangible and flimsy argument, based on nothing more than the beholders already held opinions. and even if one opposed the language quoted on the legion's site to promote the appeal, you would be very hard pressed to make any kind of connection from that to an actual support for war. so the language of certain individuals quotes is something you disagree with? take a step back and look at the bigger picture.",0,1383932966,null,0,false,0,cd9rsgm,t3_1q65sd,t1_cd9rsgm,t1_cd9phhe,null,1428739729,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

true,andrew7895,lfc68,,"To start, before the season even began I dreamed of seeing us line-up in a [3-5-2](http://i.imgur.com/wAcvOq6.png) and I was a fan of it especially when it was first implemented as we had both Johnson and Enrique.  Without them it just doesn't have near the same punch and even more leaves us vulnerable on the wings.  Apart from all that the biggest problem is we have no combination of 2 MID's capable of holding down the center of the pitch.  I was wrong and it's not our best formation going forward now.

The simplest solution that keeps getting overlooked for whatever reason is to just simply swap a CB, which in most situations is an extra man anyway especially against teams with one striker.  We desperately need that extra body in midfield and it makes so much more sense to me to have an Allen/Henderson/Alberto type as the added player in the middle instead of expecting one of our CB's to step up and handle the ball.  4-3-1-2 is out best formation now.

I'll save the 4-3-3 /4-2-3-1 topic for another day.  It bothers me to no end people saying it's difficult to find a place for Cou/Stu/Suarez without someone being out of position yet most big clubs have no problem at all fielding a play-maker like Coutinho with 2/3 forwards in front of him.  They aren't the issue, the problem is the two MIDS that are playing behind them so until we get that addressed I think we need the extra body in midfield.

Britain hasn't exactly been pushing for the EU to have the power to look into everything so it an be audited as you wish.

Finally, every member state already had such regulations. The EU simply harmonises them. If you think grading of commodities is an EU invention, you are very mistaken.

It wont be a meaningless vote because your vote is a statement. Rejecting the entrenched institutions and creating a more diverse voting public can only be a good thing.

I'l use our football club as an example. We lost our players, managers, owners, facilities and financial backing, shit, they even took our big clock from the Fratton End. We went from winning the FA Cup and Premeire League football to the depths of League 2 in less than a decade and have been on the brink of extinction on several occasions.  
We could have bitched and moaned about it (and to an extent, we did) but we also turned up week after week, cheered on the boys, sang *We will never die*, and *Play up Pompey*. When none of that worked, we banded together and bought the club.  

I ask those of you who support a local team, if they got relegated 3 divisions, would your city still buy 12,000+ tickets to a home game they were probably going to lose?

Because criticizing Scotland or that referendum makes treading on thin ice look easy. Any perceived attack on Scottish interests just plays into the hands of Salmond, who is very adept at twisting that sort of thing into anti-British propaganda.

Given that conservative MPs were predominantly voted in by the SE of England, and that Pompey is one of the most vociferously conservative parts of the country, I dare say they are probably actually pretty unhappy about this - but ultimately I think they had to make a choice about where the most political damage would be - and the result was north of the border.

It's the people that make up these parties, and their refusal to stand up and make the difference eg. Clegg. There are far too many who are simply along for the ride, who refuse to listen to informed advice and factual evidence. 

As a slightly cliched example, look at the number of ex-officials who come out and suggest the drugs policy is totally failing. Look at the amount of statistical data that suggests the current system is flawed, yet it remains no matter who is in charge and debate is blocked. You can't tell me there isn't a member of the dominant parties who don't see this and think changes would make sense.

There needs to be something for a political group to catch onto to break the mold. Ukip have only got anywhere by representing a louder, more extreme minority. I think when a large enough portion of the population refuses to engage, that's more likely to encourage change.

What exactly does my vote state? It states that I'm happy with the system in which power is determined, and that I support this other group. Do you think the political elite really care about that?

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"I haven't been on a Megabus, but I can confirm that they are a functional - if basic - way of getting from A to B. 

Just this evening, however, I saw an advert on the tube for Megabus Gold, which (in theory) comes with free wifi, power sockets and snacks, still at a price way less than the train. This should be a pretty great way to get around - most trains still don't have power or wifi. 

I think a 16-25 railcard is about £30 - it's cheaper if you order online and get it delivered, though you probably won't be able to do that. It knocks a third off the price of any train travel, so it pays for itself very quickly if you make several longish train journeys. It doesn't work internally to London, but it does work between London and other places. You must carry it with you when you're travelling on a young person's ticket. 
If you are in London, remember that a travelcard gets you onto buses as well as trains. The best way to find your way around in the UK tends to be Google Maps - it'll give you bus and train routes if they're available to Google. If you don't have sensibly priced roaming data for this, pop into a phone shop when you arrive and get a PAYG (pay as you go) SIM. I think Three is probably the best value network for this (3p/min, 2p/text, 1p/MB). Make sure you have phone that's compatible with our networks before you do this though. We also have things like Hailo over here. 

If you want to make any long journeys (1hr+) by train, book them well ahead of time (two weeks minimum). This should allow you to get an 'advance' fare which is often half the price or less. Expect to pay £30/60 to travel across/along the country by train (single, not return). Trains are generally reliable and comfortable (if you're not on a commuter route). Long distance ones should guarantee you a specific seat.

When booking, use nationalrail.co.uk (or the individual operator's website) to find times and fares if possible. Don't use The Trainline, which you'll see advertised, as it's more expensive.

Why Syria, but not Bahrain? Why Libya but not Somalia? Why no serious action to end the Gaza dispute?

Why keep open diplomatic ties with nations known to constantly violate Geneva conventions and Human rights conventions, including Saudi Arabia for example?

true,willed1234,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol,"I think the issue is it implies just by being a soldier you are a hero, worthy of adoration and millions in donations. 

I'm sure lots of soldiers do heroic things and good for them. But lots of firemen do too, as do policemen, doctors and many other groups who we rightly don't automatically term heroes. 

Soldiers sign up for a job where they will knowingly go into dangerous situations and then we're expected to fawn over them and the ""sacrifice"" they make. If you decide you want to work in a job where you're at risk of injury, that's fine, but when you get injured or lose out as part of that job, it does not make you a hero and it does not make you deserving of charitable donation. 

It mostly annoys me the amount of media and celebrity support this charity gets. It is so widely advertised and so many huge events choose to help raise funds, when in reality it supports relatively few people who I would argue are not as worthy as others of receiving funds. I worry that a single charity taking such a huge cut of charitable donations may result in less money being donated to charities which may benefit a larger number of more deserving individuals.

This being said, people are free to choose what they want to do with their hard earned money, but people should not be free to vilify those not wishing to financially support voluntarily enlisted people fully capable of understanding the risks of the job they sign up to do.

However one drawback of having all The Doctors in attendance is they all share an age-link and the visible age of them are sort of ""averaged"" out. Making the older Doctors who are actually younger look older and vice-versa (give Matt Smith a few gray hairs and have Eleven have a one-liner of never wanting to look like this ever again).

And then at the end of the story when all The Doctors go back to their TARDISes with their companions, CGI them inside their TARDIS doors aging backwards to the images of them from way back that we all watched. That way we get the best of both worlds and get to see them all partake in a story once again.

true,Cbizole,null,null,"I hear you. The current culture dictates that actually standing and calling for something like drug decriminalisation is political suicide. The current political culture cannot and will not survive forever, just like sexism and racism, it will be phased out eventually as it provides small benefits while having many flaws.

The current political system can only be the result of everything that has come before. This has been years of over 50% of the population not voting, laissez-faire attitudes and the easily corrupted nature of man by power. Not doing anything is surely not an option.

Your right, the political elite doesn't care about you and your vote in a sense. This is because the majority of current voters already vote for them and that has been enough to keep a tory-labour to and fro for since the 1920's.

But I know they care about keeping their jobs and they definitely care about keeping their power. 

So, option 1. Vote. Try to reduce the majority gap the main parties have, and force policy change. (The spin will change to policy based on facts because by the time this change has happened, as it will be of more benefit to use fact) 

Option 2. Wait. The 'Disenfranchised' to continue not voting until all the current voters die and hope beyond hope that there will be no more to replace them. Dissolve what is left of government and re-elect their own representatives. (What percentage of the country has to vote for en election to be 'legal'? )

Option 3 Protest. However I fear the only way the voice of protest is heard by cause major financial damage by 'peacefully' protesting in huge numbers in the major cities. Or not so peacefully, and rising against the institution against a backdrop of a martyr figure. This will only work if we get bigger numbers than have ever been raised in British history.

Option 4 ????? There is always another solution and I don't have many if any. Its going to take all of us to fix this.... It starts with one but has to end with many, numbers and meaningful action will speak volumes but the effective change will be painstakingly gradual (even if triggered by a big event, as we all know massive protests in Egypt may have got rid of mubarak but hasn't actually fixed much, or so its reported).",0,1383947404,null,0,false,0,cd9y33k,t3_1q3ksx,t1_cd9y33k,t1_cd9uqau,null,1428735597,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,lordweiner27,null,null,"Nobody who is stuck in traffic a lot likes the idea of being stuck in more traffic.  Yours is a view that is shared by many motorists.  

Hopefully, I can convince you why giving up space to cyclists is actually in your best interests.  

The fact is that cars take up a lot more space in a city centre than bikes, pedestrians and buses.  Here's a [picture.](http://www.dailycognition.com/index.php/2010/04/18/space-needed-to-transport-60-people-car-vs-bus-vs-bicycle.html)

Cars are big and they travel fast, unlike cars or people.  And the faster the car travels the more space it takes up in front of it and behind it too.  The highway code says that the stopping distance you should leave at 30mph is 23m (thinking distance plus braking distance.)  That's five times the length of the car.  Now you see why you rarely get up to 30mph in the city centre.  Look at this [picture](http://www.dailycognition.com/index.php/2010/04/18/space-needed-to-transport-60-people-car-vs-bus-vs-bicycle.html) again and imagine the space those cars are taken up multiplied by 5. Cars are spatially inefficient for dense population centres.  

So what can be done to help your congestion problem?  Well you could build more roads.  Well a lot of studies show that more roads just lead to more congestion as people tend to use them.  LA would be a good example.  It has a lot more roads and a lot more lanes on each road than many other cities but still has huge congestion.  
And even if we wanted to build more roads it would be hugely expensive to build more roads in Bristol city centre and destroy a lot of beautiful buildings.  

Fortunately there is a solution.  Driving is not everyone's preferred form of transport.  Some people would prefer to cycle it it was safe an easy.  And some people would rather take the car but would switch to cycling if it was faster or cheaper (and still safe of course.)  

If you are a car user it is in your interest for as many people to switch to cycling or public transport as possible.  That way they are not congesting your roads.  Segregated cycling tracks separate people from traffic in a way that makes them feel safe (and is actually safe.)  I for one wouldn't let my children cycle alongside cars and lorries on a typical British road, but I would let them cycle on Dutch infrastructure like [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSGx3HSjKDo)  
Cycle rates in Holland are as high as 50% of the population and you can see why when cycling looks so pleasant and easy, not stressful like it is on British roads.  (Part of the reason so many cyclists are nob heads is that the only people brave enough to cycle in this country are adrenaline junkies.)  

Bicycles take up a lot less space than cars so the carrying capacity of a cycle lane is much more than a lane for cars.  So basically if you give up some of your car lanes to bicycles and they are popular and well used (which they will be in the city centre) the lanes you have left will be less congested than they were before.

Davidson played a much more mature and thinking Doctor than the current previous two did.  And I think this also goes a lot to the writing and (one of my biggest gripes) the fucking sound track.  I would like to see a more serious and thoughtful Doctor like Ecclestone played, and much less buffoon bassoon laugh track.  WHenever I think of the previous two I just keep thinking about the badly written jokes, expressions of disbelief, ""Welllll"" and ""blah is cool now"".

true,lordweiner27,null,null,"I don't see why. If the last half century has taught us anything it's that smaller and smaller countries can afford to survive in the current world. 

People often don't realise that at the start of the 20th Century 24 countries and Empire controlled the whole world.  Now there are 193 members of the UN and that number will likely increase.  

It used to be that small countries were frequently invaded and annexed by large empires.  The Romans created their Empire by basically beating each neighbour one at a time and becoming bigger and bigger in the process.  But nowadays we don't put up with that.  Normally if a country unprovoked invades another country all the other countries get together and put a stop to it.  See Belgium WW1 or Poland WW2.  

It used to be that having a large Empire conveyed certain trade advantages.  The Romans built a huge road system for example.  The Mongols made it safe for anyone trading to pass through the 'Mongol sea' and trade increased on the silk road.  Nowadays though anyone can send a package or a communication to China.  They're is the internet, telephone lines, and sea routes.  You don't need to be a citizen of a certain Empire to trade with another.  Anyone can trade with anyone.  

The weird thing about the world now is that smaller countries are often doing better than bigger ones.  Especially economically.  Ireland is richer than Britain for example.  Norway, Sweden and Finland are seen as great places to live and are very rich despite having small populations.  Norway has the highest per capita GDP of the three from outside of the EU.  Singapore, (if you want to talk about a small island then Singapore really is one, both in terms of land and population) is massively rich especially when compared to it's former owner Malaysia (which is separated from in 1965) and they started off in a similar position.  

Am I saying that being a small country is an advantage in the new world?  I think with the right leadership it can be, but it is not guaranteed of course.  

When people say that the UK must be in the EU or it will not count for anything they just sound silly to me.  Would you say the same thing or Australia or Japan or Singapore?  
If Australia didn't join a trading block with America would she be 'isolated from the world?'  No, she would carry on trading with everyone just as she always had.

true,TophatJester,,Taking a conveniently-timed piss.,"Not at all! I should've put it in the OP really, but I wasn't all that optimistic. 

**What you need:**

50g butter  
750g onions, thinly sliced  
2 chopped garlic cloves  
1 tablespoon chopped sage  
1 kilo pumpkin/squash, peeled and deseeded of course  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
2 x 350g blocks of puff pastry  
Plain flour  
250g sliced fontina cheese, but plenty of alternatives like edam, Gouda, emmental  
1 egg  
Salt + pepper. 

A frying pan or two  
A griddle pan  
A baking tray  
Baking parchment. 

**Things to do:**

1. Melt the butter in a pan (I decided to use two. It's a fuckload of butter and onions), add the onions, garlic, sage, and salt &amp; pepper. Cook on a medium heat for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once soft and golden, leave to cool.

2. Cut the pumpkin/squash into 5mm (very precise recipe, bloody annoying) thick slices and brush with oil. Heat a ridged griddle pan then add batches of pumpkin, 2-3 minutes on each side until tender. Leave to cool.

3. Roll one block of pastry out on a lightly-floured surface until it's rectangular and slightly smaller than a baking sheet. Lay it on the baking sheet then spread half of the onion mixture leaving a border of about an inch. Top with half the pumpkin and half the cheese with salt &amp; pepper seasoning, then repeat the layer.

4. Roll out the other block of pastry 'til it's bigger than the other. Brush a beaten egg around the filling then top the pie and push the edges together to seal. Decorate with the tines of a fork if you like, then egg-wash and score the top in diagonal slashes. 

5. Bake in a preheated oven at 220/425/Gas Mark 7 for 25-30 minutes.",0,1383953767,null,0,false,0,cda0ir2,t3_1q7ioc,t1_cda0ir2,t1_cda03jv,null,1428734461,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2
