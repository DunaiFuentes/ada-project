I did find it odd that you replied to almost every single comment in this thread to state that you agreed with the policy. I disagree with the policy and I only commented a few times. 

The slippery slope works because 'we' are not making decisions, but politicians are. Politicians generally want as much power and influence as possible and have an insatiable desire to create laws to fulfill this and to further their ideological brief, like Tony Blair's government who literally invented three thousand new crimes. Every time you give the politicians an inch, they will take a mile. I used cigarettes as an example because they are what many people now want further encroachments against, but I could have used transport, taxation, police powers, freedom of speech, etc, etc, etc.

You have made it clear where you stand; you believe in the nanny state. You believe that individual freedom is worth nothing and that what is decided by the majority to be good for the majority is worth everything.

I can't argue against that, because it is a deeply ingrained mindset. Perhaps I could recommend Brave New World by Aldolus Huxley as an example of the logicial conclusion of your mindset and a chilling example of how individual freedom over their own lives always trumps the 'greater good'.

Since when were downvotes 'being censored'?  People simply think that you're wrong to say that there is no problem with the filters.

The fact is that porn filters, even if they were *always* on, would not stop people watching porn, and in particular would not stop people accessing child porn (which is ostensibly the entire point of this exercise), since you don't find it by doing a quick google search for 'cute preteens with fingers in their arses'.

This policy was likely heavily influenced by a task-force which strongly believes in the Obscene Publications Act of 1959 and 1964, a law which insists that media should be censored to all, just for the sake of the few who can't distinguish reality and fiction.""

I added: ""The Obscene Publications Act has actually suffered a blow to its credibility, in a court case where pornography which is deemed ""disgusting"" by anyone's definition was involved.

I hope you don't take any offence when I take you for an old fashioned
Tory, a man who has a strong sense of personal privacy and the rights
of liberty for the individual. I am writing to you to voice my concern
over the apparent plans of the prime ministers on-line pornography
'ban'. The phrase 'using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut' springs to
mind. A complete blanket over the entire country for an issue that
while i agree is important and needs looking at, is completely over the
top. The prime minister seems to think that people are using google to
look at child porn, this is ridiculous. Most childporn is on buried
hidden sites that use foreign ISP's and peer to peer network to hide
their origins and that of their users. Mr Cameron will not be catching
many paedophiles with his ban but what I fear he will do is create is a
mass grey area for the normal man; who decides what is adult content?
will i be able to look up the painting 'Venus of Urbino' or watch the
1968 version of Romeo and Juliet (which does feature an under-age
actress' breasts but which I also studied at age 15 in school for my
GCSE.

If I and other like minded men and women enjoy pornography in the
comfort of our own homes I do not wish to have to ask permission from
the company I already pay to provide me with the internet.

Is this a new Tory party policy, will he be listening to the view of
you and fellow mp's? Or is he i fear chasing the mumsnet/daily mail
crowd for a quick popularity boost.

Yours sincerely,

Me

Once a filter is in place, it will be much easier for the government to censor anything. I believe the best way we can fight this is by showing people that this is NOT about porn, and that having the frameworks for any governement controlled filter is bad.

If anyone has any data either on Britain using a law that was passed for one reason (i.e. banning porn) for another (i.e. banning anti-government websites), or any information on other governments imposing internet restrictions including their reasons why, or even example of british laws that were set up for one reason, and gradually made to encompass more (i.e. set up to ban porn, soon ban partial nudity, fiction containing porn, websites that discuss porn but don't have porn itself)

true,cdos93,scot-ayrshire,Ayrshire,"I'm writing today because I'm concerned about the wider implications of the governments plan to automatically block and filter ""adult"" sites on the internet.

My first concern is also the reason I'm so hesitant to write this message in the first place. The policy has been wrangled and presented in such a way that it paints a negative light immediately should you wish to contest it. The way the issue is spun as a means to protect children effectively makes you appear to be a sexual deviant should you seek to question it. This in itself is a worrying position.

The wider implications of this ban are huge. What it means is that from now on in the UK the government has the right to issue automatic blocks on any website found to contain adult content, they've also reserved the right to install web filters remotely to your computer, without consent. This is essentially giving the Government a blank cheque to block any website they deem in-appropriate.

This sets a worrying precedent, and could potentially be the very first step before a greater censorship of the internet, censorship that we openly condemn in countries such as China/Syria.

I am in no way supporting Child Abuse, or in subjecting children to adult content that isn't suitable for them, but the filtering and control of the internet should be a responsibility of the families. There is absolutely no need for an automatic block. If we have the infastructure to block off those parts of the internet it should be an Opt-in choice.

I appreciate this is a difficult argument to raise, but I strongly believe it's the right argument. It's a position that will likely paint opponents as deviants and ridicule any suggestions that this will go beyond its original remit.

We've seen the abusal of policies like this, by governments big and small. We've seen internet black-outs in Syria, other black-outs during the Spring Protests. The internet is perhaps one of the last bastions of free-speech and open criticism that is left to us. This isn't just about ""adult"" content, this is the first step on a very slippery slope that I am unwilling to allow to pass.

Edit: Also, if you want a hint as to their mindset, read www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcumeds/353/353.pdf

They state such things as ""We believe that incontrovertible evidence of harm is not necessarily required in order to justify a restriction of access to certain types of content in any medium"" and "" the Government should be prepared to seek amendment to the Directive if it is preventing ISPs and websites from exercising more rigorous controls over content.""

They don't care that they are censoring your media, but they speak with casual language about screening your content. Infact they think you want them to screen your content: ""We do not believe that it is in the public interest for Internet service providers or networking sites to neglect screening content"".

tl;dr: this isn't just about porn. This is an opportunity to stand up and say we don't want our stuff censored.

&gt;The police can stop anyone in a public place and ask you to account for yourself. For example, you could be asked to account for your actions, behaviour, presence in an area or possession of anything. When the police stop you and ask you for an explanation, you don't need to provide your personal details. The police do not have to make a record or give you a receipt. But you may be asked to give your ethnicity

http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/law_e/law_legal_system_e/law_police_e/police_powers.htm

**Name and personal details**

The police have the power to require you to give them your name and address in certain circumstances:

[Section 50 of the Police Reform Act 2002](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/50) allows police to require your name and address is they believe you are acting in an anti social manner and if a person fails they commit an offence.

[Section 164 of the Road Traffic Act 1988](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/164) the police can require any person who drives a motor vehicle on a road, is believed to have been in an accident on the road while driving, or is suspected of commiting an offence whilst driving on the road or a person supervising a learner driver to produce their driving licence so that they can ascertain your name and address and, in some circumstances, date of birth.

The police may tell you that you have commited an offence and they wish to report you for summons (i.e. take you to court) without being arrested. To do this they need your name and address - and they need to believe what you say is true. Technically you can be arrested for any offence, e.g. littering, if yo do not provide your name and address because otherwise how can you be prosecuted. If you subsequently provide your name and address and these were the only reasons you were arrested (so they could be obtained) you should then be dearrested.

You are not required to give your name and address or date of birth just because you have been stopped/searched.

[Police can search you after arrest to confirm your identity](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/54A).

[Police can take your fingerprints and DNA in most circumstances when you are arrested](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/61).

After arrest if you fail to give your name and address, or the police don't believe the details you give, you may not be allowed bail until they can confirm who you are.

**Masks**

If a S 60 order is in place police can require you to remove any item used for purpose of concealing your identify or to seize any item reasonably believed you intend to wear wholly or mainly for that purpose. You can be arrested if you refuse.

*Reduce smoking prevalence among adults.

*Reduce smoking prevalence among young people.

*Reduce smoking during pregnancy

The first two point correspond to my criticisms. 

&gt; there is no clear evidence this early on doesn't mean it won't be proven nor is it implied there is a timescale in which time it must be proven otherwise its incorrect. 

It doesn't mean that it is necessarily correct either. I think you look at the available evidence. While it may be that evidence for plain packaging emerges, just because it hasn't does not imply that it hasn't *yet*.

&gt; It is a fact that if your parents smoke you are more likely to smoke... proof of correlation to exposure surely?

It is. It's also proof of exposure to socially disadvantaged upbringing will be associated with greater rates of later life smoking.

true,anudeglory,eng-devon,Devon,"I somewhat agree, but that's not what is being established with the porn block - remember most forms of pornography, no matter your moral opinion on it, is legal to view, use and distribute in the UK (not sure on the terms of production but probably that too).

Criminal offences: such as paedophilia, scams (in terms of fraud), distribution of copyright materials and distribution of banned substances are already covered by their own laws.

The idea of an ""open internet"" is regardless to these forms of criminality, that is to say we should not inhibit the use of the internet (and related technologies) but deal with those that infringe the laws we already have and who use the internet to do it.

The three you use as examples have very definite examples in law. It becomes murkier when you start to inhibit the distribution/creation/use of materials that some groups may find offensive to the detriment of others. This is directly comparable to the banning of books. It also becomes problematic when governments request (or not) access to logs etc of citizens without court warrant to pursue an intended (read: guilty) legal outcome. Again regardless of the crime.

The way that some groups approach this, for example the music and movie industries has been less than ethical - I am not advocating copyright infringement but the punishment mostly does not fit the crime, and these groups should be closely monitored. Specifically when they call for censorship. A ban on government or ISP level, as has happened with TPB etc are clearly not working, as soon as TPB was taken down multiple other access routes were created (and at each stage other less well known routes, e.g. Tor were brought in to public consciousness). There is a clear response to access, in this case, if you can provide an easy to use, financially worthwhile service (e.g. debatably Netflix/LoveFilm) fewer people will illegally torrent movies. This does not provide a solution to copyright infringement but does help reduce it. There will always be people who break the law, morally justified or otherwise.

But what to do about things that are worse than downloading a movie? Well they are already covered by laws. We need to use those, and adapt them where necessary (or remove them entirely - I would argue in the case of some drug laws) to be able to better enact them and serve the people. Removing access, censorship, is not a way to do this. All of these crimes have occurred before the invention of the internet, if someone was using a library as a dead-drop for illegal materials then we do not see calls to ban access to libraries ""for the children's sake"".

What happened was that David Cameron was giving a speech to the NSPCC and wanted to say something about porn. The Daily Mail (along with other groups) has been campaigning for a ""default-on"" porn block on every Internet connection in the country. The major ISPs made it clear a long time ago that they weren't going to go for that, instead introducing systems whereby, when a new account was set up, subscribers were asked whether or not they wanted to have ISP-level filters (rather than computer/device-level) for various things.

Downing Street's great victory (which was a few weeks if not months ago) was that the ISPs agreed to have the tick-boxes (for what to filter) checked by default. Last week Downing Street realised it needed something big to announce in this NSPCC speech, so sent out [an email](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23312579) asking them to start calling their system ""default on"" rather than ""active choice"", so the Prime Minister could announce a victory.

Given that the ISPs have been portrayed by the Prime Minister as evil and complicit in child abuse, they weren't willing to go out of their way to give him any political capital to use against them, so instead he's moved the goal posts again and said that the system is ""opt-in"" and that was what he wanted all along.

---------------

Of course, that doesn't mean other bad things weren't announced today. Also included in [the speech](http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/07/david-cameron-protecting-our-children-online/) were:

* a ban on the possession of ""simulated rape"" in porn. ""Extreme"" porn (with a specific definition) is already illegal, but this would seem to take it a step further. However, without details (or draft legislation) we can't know for sure what it will cover;

* giving CEOP and the police ""all the powers they need to keep pace with the changing nature of the Internet"" - no idea what that involves, but sounds rather CommsDataBilly to me;

* getting CEOP to come up with a blacklist for search engines and then trying to convince them to implement it (and throw up ""warning pages"" for anyone who searches for them);

* repeating their cut-back of sex education for younger children; teaching them ""the Internet is evil/dangerous"" rather than (as advised by most of their experts) actually teaching them about sex,

* legislating so that ""videos streamed online in the UK are subject to the same rules as those sold in shops"" - this is probably the most worrying, as videos sold in shops have to go through the BBFC approval process; I have no idea how they will manage to do that for every video streamed online in the UK short of blocking every video site and then approving only certain ones.",0,1374514809,null,0,false,0,cb7xaro,t3_1it10q,t1_cb7xaro,t1_cb7r551,null,1430376959,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

Some crazies went around screaming about porn ... Do you really think this present set of crazies are ""the craziest the UK has to offer""?

It would not be an unreasonable next step to say that ""porn"" should not be defined by the majority, at the expense of the minority.  That wouldn't be tolerant in a multicultural society.  There is a large Muslim population in the UK, and I predict an attempt to default-ban bikini photos online, in an effort to show 'sensitivity'.

That's already the case. (Well, ignoring the Cabinet and ""higher ups"" but the rank and file MP's are all ordinary people by and large.)

The problem is there's no safe guards in place, nothing has to be double checked with experts, nothing needs approval from industry veterans; so when ordinary people get caught up in hyperbolic marketing language and the ""Think of the Children"" card gets played, we end up in a free for all of misguided and misinformed opinions and it all comes down to a complete lack of understanding, and fear, of new things. 

The same happens every time something new and revolutionary is brought to the table. Cars, Radio, Planes, TV, Trains go back far enough and there has always been people who try block things purely through ignorance or ""because his mate at the pub said it was real bad.""

Unless MP's can be held accountable for not taking the time to educate themselves on a topic, or we start having a requirement for involvement from the relevant industries, nothing will change because it's pretty normal for people to fall for power words and gimmicks.

Fuck's sake. I find it difficult to imagine just how enormous of a bell-end you have to be in order to demand that an entire country is child-proofed so your child doesn't hurt itself.

Forbid your child from **[going to the park]** until they're a responsible age make them **[play in the basement]** where the family can supervise them and until then, **[make them wear hiking boots and thick gloves at all times]**

These are the actions of a smart, responsible parent.
Force the entire country to by default accept the same level of protection given to your child, so that you yourself don't have to take any steps or make any sort of effort to ensure their own protection. These are the actions of a self-absorbed parent. These are the actions our Prime Minister deems the best.

Fuck's sake.

Actually I'm probably a little unfair in saying that these people are unwilling to go to any effort for their children's protection. They are willing to go to effort, they're just so fucking stupid that instead of simply **[never going to any public place where heroin needles could possibly be discarded]** and then supervising their children's **[every waking moment]**, they spent months campaigning for the entire country to **[not discard used heroin needles in the street, or at least get the council to pay someone to pick them up afterwards]**

It's like having a relative who's afraid of the dark, and instead of installing a nightlight, you go out and start campaigning that everybody in the country must have their lights on by default.

In a few years they'll say ""well, we should be able to block X, Y, or Z because we already are allowed to block pornography.""

It's the same deal with all the NSA snooping in the U.S. Right now. It's ""we're collecting all this data, but we only look at it while investigating terrorists."" but before you know it someone is going to say ""we should be allowed access to that data to investigate tax evasion, drug use, etc etc because it's already there."" Nevermind the fact the data was collected before anyone was accused of a crime and without their consent.

If the system exists it's inevitable that someone or some group in authority is going to advocating expanding it's use in the future because ""it's there why not use it"".

Information, like speech, deserves to be free. When your government wants to control it, all they're telling you is that they don't believe you should be allowed to think for yourself and that **they** know what's best for you.

Doing it ""for the children"" is just a really good way to get people on board with ideas they'd normally push back against.

The media reports I've read on this sound SO confused. One minute it's 'child porn is bad' (no seriously, many have included Google's stance on blocking child porn as a quote in this news, i.e. the Metro - which has nothing to do with this ban), 'violence against women is bad' (again... you're assuming porn directly contributes to violence against woman... not only is there a lack of evidence for this being the case, it forgets that there are plenty of women who enjoy porn). It just seems ANY reason to portray this as the Government seizing more control to filter the internet (I'm not going to lie, I see this as an opportunity for them to start quietly filtering out bad press... they have already tried).

I'm unsure if it's because I'm more aware of it now or if it's just this current government/end of Labour that has been a little bit too authoritarian and trigger happy when it comes to restricting and controlling what people do with the internet, and it's ridiculous.

I wonder if we'll ever get politicians who want to actually let people live their lives without continuous bullshit.

I mean, seriously, how on earth is pornography 'eroding childhood'? If you're letting your children view porn, then you as a parent are responsible. I think what we're actually eroding here is the notion of parental responsibility, not childhood. If you're not willing to take responsibility for your child, then there's things in place for that already.

I can't help but feel this is something that is going to be put out there so next year they can claim that they've reduced the number of cases of people able to view and share pictures of child abuse and have somehow stopped child abuse. It's just about as good as restricting the sale of digital cameras and claiming that has stopped child abuse simply because less material is being picked up. The reality is they'll achieve nothing, and this is most likely going to be a waste of time.

No the only way to resolve the problems, especially in England where kids are having kids is to either take the kids away from them and give them to a decent family, not foster parents as that is a money making racket and does not help kids. 

Or they need to start making parents go to classes, and if their kids have problems finding out why and what they are doing wrong, sadly as i said earlier a lot of kids are having kids and they let them run rampant, and this is what needs to be resolved.

I have seen parents that should not be near children never mind have their own, but what can the government do without being called out for trying to control every aspect of a kids life.

true,ilikegraves,null,null,"Not going to lie: usually I am the harshest most outspoken bitch when it comes to discussing rape. Not here for a lot of the rape myth bollocks that  usually gets thrown about.

But I'd be the first to say that I honestly don't believe simulated rape porn contributes directly to real rapes. In fact, some women have rape fantasies. It's a well documented part of rape culture - that women who get punished for sex (the 'slut' term being a badge that gets you treated like a lesser being, for one example) like to imagine an environment where it's 'not their fault.' This is often part of the appeal of S&amp;M (think of the relentless pursuit and lack of choice Twilight and 50 shades of grey characters have - who are these books most popular with?) This isn't the same as saying many women 'want' to be raped - but a pretend roleplay or fantasy of rape is not out of the norm.

Also, we need to talk about fanfiction for a moment. Lots of this is written by women. Lots of it, oddly enough, features rape (usually called 'non-con'). In graphic detail. And usually it's just weird and very out of character. There are long chapters afterwards where the victim deals with it. Sometimes the characters 'end up together anyway' in a kind of 'they were destined to be together and the other character 'didn't really mean to hurt them' bullcrap, etc, but that is beside the point. I've read a lot of accounts of women writing this type of fiction who use it to deal with their own rapes. That makes sense when you input the general out of character actions of the characters they are writing about. When you further factor in that you are at the most risk of rape from people you, and not complete strangers in back alleys, the fantasy of the attacker actually 'loving' the victim in some way is again probably quite a desirable outlook when you consider that they were possibly attacked by a friend, family member, boyfriend or husband... rather than believing who they thought was someone who cared for them to be someone who attacked them. 

Basically, I do not believe that banning porn is going to help. Though I also don't believe it 'curbs urges in certain men', Japan is not good enough evidence for this as their culture of shaming female rape victims very severely stops them from speaking out. However, I believe it is going to limit some of the coping methods of some victims. 

If you wanted to tackle violence against women, you should target some of the issues that allows such violence to happen. Better education in schools as to what rape actually is, how to deal with it, warning signs to look out for in partners, safe spaces to speak out for all genders, etc. Better attitudes to women and their sexuality (none of this 'slut' shaming, which usually leads to rape apologies of 'she wanted it anyway').  Banning porn is supposedly supposed to help with the former, but I honestly don't believe porn is the whole problem here. Why is inherently porn demeaning to women? Granted, some of it DOES seek to humiliate them, but you've got to tackle why this is so desirable, not simply ban everything.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Oh man! It's like you read my mind! I too am sick of these fucking nanny state laws about not discarding HIV-positive heroin needles in public parks and have helpfully edited your comment to reflect my own grievances.

A kid who's trying to look up porn on the internet- and lets face it, 40 years ago they were trying to sneak playboy mags or whatever you Euro's have over on the other side of the pond- is quite a bit different from someone leaving tainted needles in a public park. 


One's a conscious decision on the part of a minor- one who their guardians legally are entirely responsible for. If the kid damages someone's property their parents are liable for the damages. Or at least that's how we do it over here in Jesus Land. 


The other? Contracting HIV from tainted needles? An accident on the part of the kid, and a conscious (likely unconscious given the sourced community) action on the part of the user. 


For these to be like and like you'd either need comparable consequences (an embarrassed child when any remotely computer literate adult bothers to look up the web history, or the surprising lack there of, versus *HIV*) or comparable situations. These are not. 


And you've clearly never raised a kid, because not taking your eye off them when they're young is basically non-negotiable. This isn't exactly primitive man on the African plains here. Tainted needles are the least of your worries. There's enough stories of parents taking their eyes off their kids for mere moments and suddenly having the kid die when they drown in a bathtub, or electrocute themselves in the electrical socket. Yet no one is trying to ban bathtubs or electrical outlets, or associate criminal charges with the two. Curious, no?

3) It's creating a problem where one does not exist and is then trying to shoehorn a one size fits all solution that is both overreaching and would not work.

4) Who gets to decide what is obscene or porn. One man's porn is another man's collection of Helmut Newton photographs. 

5) It won't work anyway and will only inconvenience people who are paying good money for their internet access.

6) Adults who live with their parents, people who live in shared accommodation, people who have hidden sexualities, people who have partners who disagree with their sexual tastes, and so on will all be under greater scrutiny and be forced into having conversations that they need not have.

The reason they showed it at comic con is because it is a huge event and giant publicity generation machine, it is like the WWDC of Comics, TV
shows and Movies and people pay ALOT of money to go to San Diego to see that special content.

I just like you am annoyed that we do not get to see the trailer but this talk of ""Americans got it first RAWR RAWR RAWRRR"" is just three fries short of a happy meal because in reality a small group of people from all around the world got to see it before the general audience.

A not-so-slippery slope, least of all for GB where a trip through London has you recorded on a *delightful* number of CCTV's, has your government deciding what propaganda is and isn't acceptable for your kids in a few decades. 


But what's next? Do we start posting cops at theaters to make sure kids aren't seeing movies they're not old enough to see? Do we start banning books with sexual content? What about magazines? Many mags run ads that are *very* racy despite the mag about fairly benign subject matters, though I know how Euros like to commit murder over a *soccer* game. 


Do we start building 30 foot walls on each side of every bridge? Someone could fall off that or physically climb over a 5 foot barrier. Does every knife need to come with a rubber guard that can only be removed with a government issued key and lock so that only a *mature, trusted adult* can use it? 


At the end of the day I seldom have little interest, nor time for these kind of debates about how we need to censor the internet for the *children* because you could be saving thousands of lives by doing hundreds of benign little things, like issuing mandatory laws about wearing safety helmets while driving cars and using a 4-point seat belt rather than the common 3-point belt. If you required high clearance vehicles to get special permits and only be used in special locations- because you're only ever driving an SUV or one of *those* trucks in certain areas and climates- you could save even more. You can always hire more cops. You can always issue more laws. You can always try to do more.



But at the end of the day? Humans aren't perfect. Our instruments, flawed, and our laws porous. Government is an inherently unwieldy instrument. I don't exactly know how the modern British government came about, but when the US was founded the Founding Fathers intentionally built the government to be inefficient because private enterprise was inherently going to be better at doing *almost* anything because it is- or at least was- beholden to the bottom line.

true,oneoffaccountok,null,null,"Porn *is* largely demeaning to women, but let's just woooah there a moment. There are *a lot* of female porn stars who clearly get off on being called sluts, whores and so on by the male performers. Most of these women are not good actors (let's be honest) and could not convincingly pretend to enjoy being treated like or called those kinds of names if they didn't actually get a high from it. I've also seen numerous behind the scenes style interviews where the female performers claim that being treated badly and called degrading names are part of what they love the most about the job. You could say that they've been told to say that for the camera, but honestly, porn is a very free environment for women these days. Hundreds of thousands of women are involved in porn and for many it's a lucrative business and they treat it like a profession. The idea that women are slaves to some porn-pimp is also outdated. Most of these women are extremely business savvy. They have their own websites, their own PR, their own brands and they only do what they're prepared to do in order to earn the money they want to earn.

Sure, there's an underclass of porn where women are severely maltreated. But that's always going to be the case. My point is that the women as well as the men are to blame for perpetuating these views about the role of the female in sex. Education about sexuality needs to be directed at women as well as men, and youngsters need to be involved in open discussions about what sex is and what it isn't. Because porn certainly isn't what real sex is about. It's completely unrealistic, yet this is where most kids get their sex ed these days.

Banning porn won't protect these kids from exposure because they'll seek it out, and if anyone is tech savvy these days its youngsters. 

In short, I agree that education is needed, but I disagree that men are solely to blame for perpetuating sexual myths. And I know plenty of women (many of them ex-girlfriends) who have rape fantasies. They were never raped, nor would want to be. It's a fantasy. I fantasize about being Aragorn in Lord of the Rings but that doesn't mean I really *want* to be Aragorn from Lord of the Rings. I'd be fucking terrified. The orcs would eat me for breakfast. I'd break under the responsibility.

First off, the majority of parents (in any country) are dumb-as-fuck. This is a function of the majority of people in any country being dumb-as-fuck. As a result, no matter what changes in religious, or social mores take place, there will always be that portion of the population that will follow along and blindly let their kids engage in almost any kind of activity or expose them to any kind of content as long as someone in a position of professorial influence tells them that this is ok. As a result, don't be surprised when Disney launches a site with a name like KidZ Zone that contains ass-to mouth porn. As long as it has a ""kid-safe"" label, there will always be that dumb-as-fuck portion of any population that will feed it to their kids, along with a can of frosting for lunch, no matter what the content. 

The default filtering won't do anything to stop most people from viewing porn sites. People will just request the filter to be removed. Hell, some kids will probably nag their parents to remove the filter because the other kids at school are talking about how cool the latest Disney ass-to-mouth shit is. The filter is a distraction tool, not a filtering tool. It does nothing to rid the nation of the scourge of porn. It gives government a back-door (no pun intended) to exploit to the tune of spying on it citizens. 

If porn were truly a native concern to big government, then someone in big government would have stopped it a long time ago.

No...it made more sense instead, to allow people to become hooked on the stuff so that in addition to being able to ""scourgeify"" for the purpose of creating a spy tool out of a supposed censorship program, you would also have the additional bonus of being able to criminalize large swaths of people for behaviour that they had been been led to believe, up to that point, was wholesome, approved behaviour.

Rivoli Art Studio - looks 'quirky'

While they could make usage illegal, Tor is almost impossible to block as there is no list of entrance nodes. They could block the download site, but that won't do much

&gt; Encryption in the UK is redundant - Under R.I.P.A, it is illegal to withhold encryption keys from the police, which means every piece of information you've secured, by law, has to be accessible to the police,

This is where [deniable encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption) is useful. Truecrypt has support for a whole hidden OS whose existence cannot be proven. You just give them the decoy key instead and they can never know, not without exhausting every single possible passphrase

It's still bad that this is happening though

PS. Can't providers terminate service at any time if the owner claims it's been stolen already? This will only cut off the phone though, it won't shut the phone down.

The stills are from a scene depicting Osbourne violently anal raping Cameron in the Queen's waiting room in some palace. It took me all of 1/2 an hr to make from start to finish and would have taken half as long if skyrim wasnt slowing my pc down. 

So, anyone care to come up with a script? Perhaps Osbourne remarking how he and cameron will no longer be able to share their 'home-videos' over the net.

And if there is interest I can post some video footage too. Although I have them using generic actor voices atm. Anyone do a good impression?

Given the nature of the thread discussion (fasting for ramadan) he does fixate on the disparagement of muslims in particular which is unfortunate and inappropriate, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to call someone's admittedly rude and crude rants against religious belief in toto as ""hatespeech"", and to delete it in the name of tolerance shows an immense amount of intolerance for anyone who might view religion as something that is not ""just o.k. whatever you believe"", and wishes to speak out against religion as something which is primarily illogical, irrational, barbaric and intellectually antiquated, as well as something that has caused and continues to cause an immense amount of violence, strife and oppression in the world. 

Granted, /r/chelseafc really isn't the forum for such a discussion, but I don't think that justifies deleting someone's comments, and threatening bans in the name of so-called ""tolerance"" because they are anti-religion.

true,ilikegraves,null,null,"I feel like what I have said has been misinterpreted. Possibly because I'm not being clear enough, so I will try to be clearer here.

First: I have no issue in women working in porn. If they want to, I want them to be able to. Safely and without judgement. I want them to be able to read stories to kids in classrooms later in life without being harshly judged for it (re: Sasha Grey). Seriously, I'm not on a downer on porn. If people want to work in porn I feel that they should be supported in that decision. Banning it only makes it *less* safe as it has to go underground. Women working in porn was not my issue. 

The *word* slut is not the problem. Being called a slut and being humiliated in the bedroom when you like it is also not the issue. It's the fact that a woman can be treated differently (in a bad way) by her peers because of it with no input as to whether she enjoys it or not. It can be detrimental to her relationships and her career to be deemed a slut. Women are bitchy to her, men are more likely to demean her, etc. It's the *attitude* people have to women that are called sluts. That someone is likely to treat you badly or view you badly because you sleep around. That 'slut dropping' (the act of picking up drunk women and leaving them somewhere random) is funny, that women can be dismissed as being a slut ('well, she's a slut anyway'), that women will stop being friends with you for fear you'll steal their husbands or some shit. Being called a slut usually the first step in someone treating you in a worse way, and on the most severe end of the scale even dehumanizing you. 

Being degraded *with consent* is totally different to being degraded without it.

I never said women were not to blame as well. Women are just as bad at slut shaming as men. The type of education I mean about women owning their sexuality is that women are *specifically* the victim of the 'slut' type of demeaning mechanism, not that women do not perpetrate it. All genders need to be taught that women own their own sexuality. Not that *men* have to be taught to respect a woman's sexuality. Women also buy rape myths ('well, why did you let him buy you a drink?' is not a gender specific belief - this is why I think we need to teach what rape is, and as I did not mention it clearly enough in my last post I believe this needs to be taught to *everyone*, not just men).

yeah, what does that even mean? are you saying my point is not proof because of other factors involved? that would be you contradicting yourself.

There are a lot of other points, from: potentially higher rape rates, more teen pregnancy and less sexual knowledge as an individual and over the teen demographic.

&gt;...more young people are seeing sexually explicit material before the age of 16, it is also true that more of them have positive attitudes towards women... suggests that seeing pornography under the age of 16 is not causing negative attitudes towards women

Amusingly:

&gt;a number of variables did emerge as directly correlated with negative attitudes towards women. These included voting for a right wing political party; being religious; completing a lower level of formal education; being older; and living away from a major urban centre. 

And:

&gt;it seems more likely that ‘young people who have initiated sex lives may be attracted to sexual content in the media because it resonates with their experience’

And:

&gt;it would be hard to claim that these children represented a generation obviously more corrupted or more knowledgeable about sex than previous ones’

And

&gt;...the problem here was more the parents’ expectations than the children’s knowledge. In fact, they found that for children, their parents’ expectations caused more problems for them than the information they encountered about sex

In conclusion:

&gt;All of the data that has been gathered suggests that accidental exposure to pornography by prepubescent children, or deliberate seeking out of such material by adolescents, does not in itself cause negative effects

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; making giving up easier (in theory) surely is reducing prevalence?

Is my point. The linked study shows no evidence of behavioural change. 

&gt; Looking at available evidence includes looking at behavioral trends.

This study didn't. It is therefore not evidence that plain packaging works for the three criteria the government is interested in. 

&gt; Why ban cigarette advertising on TV if it has no effect? Why ban any form of Cigarette advertising?

Just because one form of intervention is effective, does not mean they will all be. Incidentally, tobacco advertising was widespread even during falling smoking rates in the general population. You are familiar with the fact that these sorts of bans benefited Big Tobacco (no need to advertise and maintain market share as your rivals can't advertise too)? I am not saying that plain packaging will have no effect, merely that the linked study does not show evidence that plain packaging will have the desired effect, with reference to the three aims outlined. 

&gt; &gt; It is. It's also proof of exposure to socially disadvantaged upbringing will be associated with greater rates of later life smoking.

&gt; This point is going round in circles.

That's my point. You cannot tell if it's the transmission of behaviours, or the other characteristics which cause people to smoke, or a mixture of both (my feeling) and in which quantity. My entire post has been about uncertainty. 

&gt; are you saying my point is not proof because of other factors involved?

Yes.

&gt; that would be you contradicting yourself.

Why? My entire point is that the article posted does not fully explain the entire process, nor eliminate competing causes. 

&gt; Basically you and your smart arse choice of words has me confused 

Not intentional. I read this stuff on a regular basis and it creeps in. Apologies. I meant that it might be something about the family- e.g. they are poor- which leads to smoking, as opposed to your suggestion that it was purely kids copying their parents (not to say that that does not have a role to play)

&gt; +1 point to you.

That being said, many of you are completely minimizing how pervasive and sick some of the pie on the Internet is AND how hard it is to protect your kids from the worst of it.  You do not help your side of the argument by painting everyone who feels concern about this as fat, stupid prudes who cannot parent.

I raised two stepkids, one of them autistic.  I'm anything but a prude, and we supervised our kids closely.  I didn't even care if our kids saw regular old sex porn after age fifteen or so.  But I did have a problem with RAPE porn and torture porn and child porn and bestiality being available to an autistic kid with mental problems.  We had to forbid him any Internet access for four years because of this crap and the insidious way it is linked to and pops up.  He would see an image and obsess over it.  He is mentally ill.  It only took one time of him talking about strangling little naked kids because he saw something online to convince me to block ALL access.

My son lives in a group home in a neighborhood now.  It could be YOUR neighborhood.  He has low empathy and poor impulse control.  He can now look at any sort of porn you like and it is easy for even him to find it.  Do you want him feeding his obsessive imagination on pictures of torturing and raping women and children?  Well I am sure he IS.  We were able to stop most of it in our house but society says he can watch it now.  

So censorship?  I don't like it but I am also aware that there are a LOT of mentally Ill people who would be safer to have around if there weren't visual primers on how to sexually abuse a person so easy available.

Basically, there are two kinds of lawyers: barristers and solicitors. A solicitor would be more akin to an American lawyer; they work in law firms and advise clients directly (as do some barristers these days, but that is a more recent development). This distinction no longer exists in America, not sure if it ever did actually, although there is a distinction between Solicitor and Attorney General.

Anyway, barristers are the wig-wearing court advocates who have the right of audience in the Court of Appeals, the Crown Court, and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. 

They are self-employed and organize themselves into 'chambers' where they can take cases either as prosecutors or defenders. In the former case they would be paid by the state to prosecute on its behalf. Now, however, the Crown Prosecution Service has emerged to employ salaried barristers who do nothing but prosecute on the state's behalf. 

This somewhat resembles the American district attorney system, which has some barristers worried, namely because it means that there are far fewer cases available for non-CPS barristers. Anyway, I could drone on and on about this but if OP or anyone is interested there's a great [BBC documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d78ROXCPgI) on barristers.

The English club is closer to what is required for the transfer Valencia

SD Valencia and Tottenham are gathered studying the transfer of Roberto Soldado. In principle, the Franco Baldini trip responds to the enormous interest of the English club to take the front, hence it is high enough above the offerings that had been sent through representatives of Soldado. Valencia is adamant that 30 million euros and Tottenham's pretty close to getting there, although the continuous Except Amadeo appointment at the Melia Palacio de Congresos between some anticipation.

The offer from Valencia to negotiate the transfer for the price of the clause, without forcing soldier to deposit the amount in the league, has been the trigger for this meeting to negotiate and Tottenham striker directly purchase.""

Honestly the line between barristers and solicitors gets less clear every day. Up until about 10 years ago barristers never even met directly with clients, they always had a case referred by an instructing solicitor. 

The idea behind this was that barristers would weigh the merits of the case and thus could opt out of representing clients they believed to be guilty.

It's just that, if you take away something that's better than masturbating without porn, the other options become the go-to. This is ultimately, sex. 

I won't include every option, but let me give you a simple diagram:

Masturbation without porn &lt; Masturbation with porn &lt; Sex
***

Now, lets fix this with what's going to happen with its removal:

***
Masturbation without porn &lt; Sex
***
Although it may not be many that do it, people will have sex because they can't watch porn. And the results are as i said: 

1. Higher rape rates - Why? More people rely on sex as **the** release of their sexual tension -&gt; more people will rape, simple.

2. More teen pregnancy - Do i need do explain?

3. Less sexual knowledge - As a teen, i feel that the sexual education i was given was severely lacking. We got shown one 5 minute presentation in year 6 and that was that. During Highschool, teachers were too embarrassed/worried to teach the subject directly - they told us to learn from textbooks and paper only, which didn't help. The majority of my sexual knowledge came from pornography, which this will ban - causing teen to generally know less about sex.

Every citizen should have the power to bring forth a point of discussion before a Senate made up of ALL citizens, which would be a bit difficult being we have 60+ million of the fuckers. 

So that obviously can't happen we have the system we have today, which is in my opinion infinitely superior to the circus our American cousins have to suffer.

The problem as I see it is the complete disconnect between the majority of the most known/vocal MPs and the issues that we face today.

&gt; My kids are protected already, but many irresponsible parents do not. 

I don't doubt that you are a good parent. After all, you are showing concern for your kids in this very conversation. But the fact remains that society is not a parent and while society should take account of children, they are ultimately the responsibility of their parents. There is of course the broader question of what to do about unfit/irresponsible parents and indeed how you can define them as such, but this is a separate issue.

I don't disagree that children need to be protected from the harsh realities of life until they are emotionally and physically ready to handle them, but children today are safer and more protected than ever before. [This was the harsh reality for kids just 100 years ago.](http://imgur.com/vq6wIVF) If you weren't luck enough to be from a rich family then you got no childhood.

When society enacted laws to protect children from working they didn't also restrict adults rights to work just in case. We can enact safety laws for children without disenfranchising adults in the process.

Really? History calls that false, for various reasons.

What you said isn't true because its happening all over the planet right now as people are getting sick of governments screwing them over.

Greece was civilized until the government pushed the Greek people to far, now they are rioting, its their only course of action at a government that will not obey its people, and is now controlled by an outside governing body. As long as the EU can now dictate what Greece can and cannot do, its now longer a representative government of the people.  Now some might argue its Greece's fault spending so much money - but the EU is partly to blame for this mess as well.

I'm sorry to burst your idealistic bubble, but the vote only works when its backed up by force.  If you vote and the ruling party turns around and says ""no, what are you doing to do about it"" and they don't listen to the will of the people, they don't listen to petitions, or protests, or peaceful resistance, the correct response is overthrowing that party.

Right now, most people would say the corruption in a lot of governments is beyond a joke, the main political parties are a round robin of continuing on with what the last lot did.  Most make part of their election promises to undo what the previous lot had done with civil liberty reduction, and instead take it further.  The power structure of a lot of governments is set up so that small parties (fringe or alternate) do not have a snowballs chance in hell of getting into power, and the media do a wonderful job at constantly telling people that voting for small parties is a  wasted vote. 

In such a situation how do you start afresh and completely remove the rotten core of corruption from government without completely replacing it, which most likely will require removing those in power against their will?",0,1374524711,null,0,1374526093,0,cb81d5p,t3_1it10q,t1_cb81d5p,t1_cb7xja2,null,1430374972,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The video is lost (probably forever), but the audio of all the episodes still exists, so people have made reconstructions by overlaying the audio with still photos taken during production. I've never watched any of these but apparently they're somewhat watchable, but tedious.

As for the 90 episodes rumor... well, probably not, but nobody can know for sure.

But it also seems to be easy to bypass (the article mentions HTTPS as one method, which strikes me as stupidly simple)

It also seems to me quite doubtful that that particular system would be a good choice for blocking good old regular porn, since the amount of filtered IP addresses that would need to be proxied would surely be orders of magnitude larger, particularly if a CDN is hosting content, the implication of that again being that you'd need a massive amount of extra hardware to filter it. 

So again it's either unworkable/bypassable/too expensive, or all of the above. So I'd imagine that DNS will be the only somewhat workable method, but if I'm wrong I can see this being a very slippery slope because if you can't even tell when something (possibly something completely non-illegal, and non-pornographic) is being filtered then you're heading down a very dangerous road:

First it's porn, next it's hate speech - but there's no-longer an op-out, then it'll be ""dangerous information"", then the scope of what is ""dangerous information"" widens... and suddenly you're far beyond some philosophical line in the sand and you've effectively broken the internet.

So yeah I hope it'll be via DNS because that at least is an equivalent of gentle nudge away from the library, whereas the alternative opens up a path towards just burning down the whole fucking building.

True! But unfortunately, I can't google a bunch of porn-related stuff at work. I'll try to find my sources when I'm at home later, if I remember to. If you're impatient, you could always poke around on your own :)

EDIT: emailed myself a link from my phone! http://marriagegems.com/2010/04/02/porn-use-increases-infidelity-divorce/

I've seen that 30% figure a lot of places, but I wouldn't be surprised or unhappy if it was higher. Women have sex drives equal to men and have been shown recently to be as much if not a little more aroused by visual stimulation - but of course, porn is mostly made for what society perceives as ""male tastes,"" so that's alienating for a lot of women. 

&gt;I find this highly dubious because I've seen a lot of articles that suggest almost _all_ if not _all_ men watch porn regularly.

I think ""regularly"" is the key word here, though we don't have a clear definition of what it means. x number of times a week? 3+? Who knows. But I think you'd agree that men in relationships, especially live-in ones, would be less statistically likely to be ""regular"" porn viewers as compared to single guys, just from a practical standpoint.

But again, we're not just talking about men. Whatever the percentage, if you consider that _people_ in relationships who are ""regular"" porn viewers are actually more likely to cheat, that challenges the porn = catharsis viewpoint that a lot of people here hold without ever having thought too hard about it.

&gt;But that doesn't automatically mean in any sense whatsoever that porn causes rape.

You're right, and that wasn't my argument. Again, I'm merely presenting potential opposition to the ""porn = catharisis = less likely to commit the immoral act you were otherwise going to"" way of thinking. Whether that's rape, or cheating, or whatever else. Obviously the story is quite a bit more complex than that. :)",0,1374528737,null,0,1374529837,0,cb82znn,t3_1irsvg,t1_cb82znn,t1_cb7yu6i,null,1430374206,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Including things which could be construed to endager life were they seen out of context, like breathplay or the infliction of (consensual and enjoyable) physical harm on each other, *pretend* rape, or harming each other to the point of drawing blood and leaving bruises and scars. It might seem frightening to somebody who doesn't understand it, but that doesn't mean they can or should stop us doing it, because a hell of a lot of people like us enjoy BDSM and we're damn well going to keep on doing it.

We would also like to keep on fapping to it when we're not actually doing it. So please, fuck off Cameron.

I have another point. What about movies that have rape scenes in them? ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" has a couple, one of which is actually filmed by a character within the movie.

Florentino Perez, after selling Claude Makelele. This was just before the famous Galacticos era would really begin to take place. Real Madrid sold Makelele to Chelsea, and bought David Beckham. The only thing the Galacticos won after selling Makelele was a La Liga title in 2007, their last season. 

In the meantime, Chelsea had won two Premier League titles, two League Cups, one FA Cup and one Community Shield with Makelele. 

Although DM's like Alonso, Busquets, Makelele, Viera and now recently Arturo Vidal and Michael Carrick (He's been rather unpraised the seasons before the last) are frequently praised for their work, I still feel that many DM's are incredibly underrated by football enthusiasts all over the world.

The thinking behind this is (as usual) knee-jerk, disjointed, dangerous, and just another step on the road to try and control what British people view on the internet in the privacy of their own homes.

Mikel is one of the most valuable players in our squad, and among the best DM's in Europe.

I actually feel Alonso, Vidal and Carrick get their praise because they are not true defensive midfielders. Vidal is more of a box-to-box and the other 2 are more playmates à la Pirlo.

Dear Mrs Bray MP,

I am writing to you as you are my local MP, the person who gives me a voice within the Houses of Parliament as one of your constituents, so I want to tell you I was disappointed this morning to learn of the proposed opt-in system for Online Pornography, it seems to me that the belief of governments who are faced with issues they do not like seems still to be to try and ban and block them rather than face them in a constructive and grown-up manner; rather than trying to combat the issue of people, especially young people, who are influenced negatively through online porn through education and promotion of responsible parenting, government once again goes for the ""sledgehammer to crack a nut"" method of doing things, except, this time, I think even that analogy overplays how effectively this method of protecting children from unsavoury things they shouldn't be seeing will work, as a sledgehammer will indeed at least break the nut.

I would now go on a lengthy diatribe on the issue, pointing out why it's flawed and why the bill should be stopped before it becomes law so it can be replaced with something that would actually protect children as you hopefully intend, however, I believe this article pretty much says perfectly what I wanted to say:

http://paulbernal.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/10-questions-about-camerons-new-porn-blocking/

To summarise the most pressing points:

* Who gets to decide what counts as pornography? 
* How do we make sure they are impartial and fair?
* How much will it cost the taxpayer, in this already poor economy, to enforce these blocks?
* How will the government keep the list of those who have opted-in safe?
* How can we be sure they won't misuse the information gathered from this list?

And, the three biggest arguments against this:

* Much of the talk surrounding this bill has been in regards to Child Porn. While I wholeheartedly agree that this is a terrible evil that needs to be tackled with much force, these proposed measures will have absolutely no effects on Child Pornography as it can only be accessed on the Darkweb anyway, a Google Search for it will not return anything a would be viewer of it wants. This baffling oversight in regards to one of the key points of the legislation only goes to show that the policymakers don't really know about the issues they are dealing with, and are simply swinging blows in the dark, which is a concern for obvious reasons.
* People who want to get around these blocks, most notably teenagers who, let's face it, for the most part will want to view pornography, can and will get around these blocks. Many young people already are able to get around filters their parents have placed on the internet within their own homes, and it will happen on a much larger scale if this opt-in block is put into place. One of the more popular methods of getting around such blocks is through usage of a TOR, which can be used to access the aforementioned Darknet. I put it to you, when young people do invariably access pornography on the internet, and I promise you they will one way or another, it is only natural for someone entering puberty to want to explore their sexuality, something which is healthy rather than a failing of character as some view it as; would you rather they do so on websites which depict acts between consensual adults, and generally no worse than this, or on a platform where they are potentially surrounded by much worse, where one wrong click to put them on a website full of the worst of the worst on the internet and where the ""rape porn"" this bill plans to block will be actual rape rather than simulated.
* Lastly, but by no stretch of the imagination leastly, this is censorship. I and most other rational people within the UK are for the most part highly against censorship because we know exactly what it can lead to. I want to have faith in government and in the people who represent me of course, though, the cynic in me shouts pretty loudly that, one day the government decides that we must opt-in to view pornography, who knows what else it might say might be dangerous for us to see, and who knows whether or not we'll get an opt-in option on the material the government doesn't want us to see within future legislation? All I'm saying is that once a framework is in place that censors parts of the internet, the biggest exchange of information known to humankind, it is very easy to slowly broaden the filters, and there's enough hot-button issues which can be used as excuses in which to do so, ""Think of the children!"" being the tried-and-tested one used this time of course. I assure you that if the cynic within me is correct, the vast majority of the Great British public will not be fooled by any attempt to creep away our rights and liberties.

I write to you in good faith that you have the best interests of the public, and in particular our most vulnerable and impressionable members, in mind. And thus, you will urge David Cameron and his team of policymakers to scrap this overbearing, expensive and ineffective piece of legislation. This will not protect our children, if anything it will harm them even further and potentially push them towards worse material, and will make parents believe that their children are being protected from the worst corners of the internet when they will not be safe from them at all. I implore the government to instead look at alternatives such as educating children about how to stay safe online and in regards to questionable content, and educating parents how to look after their kids online.

Yours faithfully,
  [My name]

If the production side of it is handled properly so that those involved are treated well, no direct harm is caused. To those watching it, they should understand that it's mostly acted bullshit and not how real sex works. Which they'll soon find out as soon as they lose their virginity...

Frankly I don't see the big issue with teenagers watching porn. They're horny all the time. They think about sex a lot, and they want to whack off. Girls too, don't forget. If they don't watch internet porn (and they will anyway because a good swathe of people born since the '80s or '90s are computer-savvy enough to circumvent any filters), they'll just fantasise like people have done since the year dot. Or find porn mags, like people did before the internet.

Masturbation is great. Porn makes it more fun. Sex is awesome, once you learn the ways of it. We shouldn't have this repulsive British prudishness when talking about it. It's natural and fun and awesome and everyone does it.

I think I first saw porn when I was 11 or 12, and it hasn't turned me into a murderous raping monster.

I remember when Napster and Limewire were around and popular for a few years before the law got onto them and they faded away. There was some seriously dodgy stuff on Limewire besides all the music, like child porn, and I agree that some of it would be better off not existing for the benefit of those involved in making it. But those P2P networks aren't used much any more. So what? There are a bunch of others, and when they're closed down there will be more.

One of the strengths of the internet when it was conceived as a communications system for the US military was that it was decentralised and therefore resistant to attack (by multi-megatonne Soviet fusion bombs, I might add; a rather more powerful force than a bunch of outraged Daily Fail readers). This leads to a game of Whack-A-Mole when trying to censor or stamp out anything on the internet. You can't. It'll keep changing, and people will always find a way around guards that are put in place.

Some people contend that the income from the Crown Estates is a profit turned by the Royal Family.  It is in fact the profit from North Sea gas explorations, marine wind projects... It belongs to the State.  To say that we profit by that because of the monarchy is a sleight of hand.

As to whether tourism benefits from a Royal family- well Paris has a larger tourism revenue than London, but either way, I've never seen any kind of audit on this one.

&gt; Can someone dispute or support that with actual figures?

I've never seen any kind of proper public spending audit on the Royal family, so it's all conjecture.

&gt; Are they parasites or not? Is there a definitive answer?

""Parasite"" is an extremely emotive term.  I don't think there could be a definitive answer.  I don't think they wittingly live parallel lives to benefit ""scroungers"" but my personal view is that it doesn't really matter the financial cost- it is the cost to our ideas of open, meritocratic government that is the dearest cost.

&gt; Also, does anyone else find it hard to hate on a newborn baby? Because I find that to be in very poor taste and bad character.

I see exactly what you mean, but when you consider that at the moment there is a massive outpouring of public sycophancy towards the Royals at the moment, this kind of thing is inevitable- I find the idea that a future UK leader has already been decided at the very moment of his birth to be extremely distasteful.",0,1374531288,null,0,false,0,cb83z6f,t3_1iu7vr,t1_cb83z6f,t3_1iu7vr,null,1430373740,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The fat cats in the record labels are not the ones who are suffering, it's the people they employ and independent musicians (such as me), film makers and so on. Before piracy hit big on the internet musicians had a much, much greater chance of making a living, I'm not talking being rich, but a living. This industry feeds some people and we have every right to block these sites. Yes there is arguments that Piraters would still pay the same amount of money, but there is no doubt that these industries have suffered massively.

For starters it should be an opt-in system, if you want your kids to be protected, you need to install some software (made freely available) to do so, the ISP should not be involved here at all.

That and the list of banned websites needs to be public knowledge.  The biggest problem with the system proposes here in Australia was not only that it was supposed to be eventually compulsory, but also that the ""blacklist"" was hidden and maintained by only secretive government departments.  It was a federal crime to even view the list of blocked websites, and when it was (promptly) leaked, shit hit the fan.  There was all sorts of shit on there that shouldn't have been blocked, the list supposedly only contained child pornography sites, however there were many many free regular porn sites included, a variety of online communities (including a certain image board), private websites, websites related to piracy, and even some dudes lawn-mowing business.

true,sunthunder,num1,,"This might sound a bit sacrilegious, but I think if we are lining up for another wide forward in the mold of Bernard, I'd let Lennon go. We can probably get a fairly decent price for him, and as much as I like him, he's not suited to a 4-3-3. He can function in a 4-2-3-1 but even then, there are better players who will provide a better end product. Lennon could still be an absolutely key player for a lot of premier league sides, and as much as it pains me to say it, I think we might have grown past what he can offer us, and if we can get +£10m for him to re-invest in the squad, I think we should take it. 

Also, Dempsey. I like Dempsey and respect the kind of player he is, but I just don't think he's what we need, and again if we can get a decent fee to reinvest in the team, we probably should.

Happy for Parker/Hudd to go, simply not what we need in midfield. I'd actually be open to keeping Livermore. He's a proper yid, and I'm worried about Sandro's knee and Dembele's reccurent hip problems. I'm just envisaging a scenario where Sandro does his knee again and Dembele has injury problems. Could we really cope with a midfield two of Paulinho and Holtby? Or a midfield three of Holtby/Sigurdsson/Paulinho? I think we need another player capable of just being a destroyer and breaking up play, just incase the unthinkable happens to Sandro and Dembele.

true,kezza596,eng-norfolk,Norfolk County,"Looking at the current comments, I'm going to get downvoted to shit, but I'm going to put this out there anyway.

Myself, my mum and both my nannys used to read these books a lot. They're not 'graphic descriptions of child rape'. Hardly any of them even involve rape, and even then, the author is tasteful enough to simply heavily hint towards it rather than anything like 'He forcefully put his penis in my vagina'.

It's not simply about the abuse, it's normally about what it did to them mentally, how it affected their life afterwards, and adjusting to 'normal' life if/when they have those responsible put to justice.

The main one I can recommend is the trilogy of David Pelzer. This one opened my mind to so many new emotions, and the idea of putting your past behind you and moving forward as a better person. His mother beat him violently. He was referred to as 'it' and kept almost prisoner in their basement until he was about 16 years old. Then he fell into a circle of bad behaviour because he desired the approval of someone, anyone, and the easiest way to get it was from other kids by misbehaving.

He now has a wife, multiple children, and travels the world giving help and support for victims of abuse.

To deny this happens and that it is 'disgusting' to discuss and learn about almost puts you on par of the mother who kept it all quiet. It is the taboo we raise on this that makes it so difficult for victims to speak out, fearing such a backlash as this.

Disagree with me as you please, I simply felt I needed to put my two cents in as it angers me to see someone label and brush something aside without even looking into it.

(What were the words of George Carlin? Oh yeah: *Fuck the children!*)

*Even if* it were about the abuse of children (which is a horrible thing, lets not even try to debate that point), what on earth does blocking the site do? It doesn't stop these crimes from happening (go and arrest the fuckers! No pun intended), it doesn't even make it that difficult to bypass - I mean at best what you get, are paedophiles whom you are inadvertently teaching to become more computer-savvy and all that this implies - I say, lets get all of this stuff out in the open, lets get it to infect people's nostrils so it disgusts them as much as possible, and by that, hopefully we can get a proper law enforcement response to get these creeps behind bars.

**Thirdly**, I checked that list of yours, it doesn't actually contain piratebay or any permutation of that name that I could find (yes I downloaded the list to check its contents, fuck you PRISM!) though I did see a lot of creepy-sounding site-names.

**Fourth**, what is this nonsense now about pornography in general and its effects on children? If you're going to throwing around heavy-weight claims like that (In this case mr. Cameron is doing so), you better have some actual data to back this up, and I mean some hard scientific data; peer reviewed, verified,  signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters - Otherwise one might be tempted to think you're just making shit up as you go along. (We all know that he is, unless I magically get my wish granted, I was just making a point). I mean who are these negligent douche-canoes who call themselves parents anyway. Seriously, who are these morons who decided that *the best* solution for their underage, pre-teen (lets be honest, once you're a teen..hormones, you will find porn, without or without the consent of parents or government, I know, I've been there) child is to leave them on the computer, unfiltered on the internet, unsupervised ..and then afterwards, when some awkward questions and moments come up as a result, the best response is to blame the porn industry and demand that the government do something about it...If any of you, who are reading this, does this: **FUCK YOU VERY MUCH! YOU SPINELESS, SNIVELLING, SELF-ABSORBED, NAVEL-MUNCHING, MYOPIC DOUGHNUT!**

**Finally**, not to mention most importantly (in my view at least), I think we should **all**, collectively, take a refreshing course in freedom of speech, expression and press, which doesn't just imply the right to speak, it implies the right to be heard, and for people to listen and to see. For this task (and invite others to add their own contribution), I nominate this video by an intellectual hero of mine, Christopher Hitchens: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyoOfRog1EM

I think if they threw a £4.5m bid at Hooper than they could wait around a bit more and see who may become available. My initially thinking based on last year's poor strike rate was that the final attacker would be more of a marquee signing, like if the Austin or Hooper bids came off, but if they are really out of options I'm sure Bruce knows what he's doing, all our other signings this summer have been brilliant.

&gt; I'd much rather us take a gamble (and if some reports are to be believed, Sagbo could cost us just over 850k) on a foreign striker then spend a shit load of money on Darren Bent's wages. 

Well I can see that's where we differ then, as I'm the opposite.

Also, I didn't rule out the entire foreign market; I was pleased at the acquisition of Nick Proschwitz last year but he came with some promise. Now we're looking at having Graham, Sagbo, Proschwitz and Fryatt as our attackers, 8 goals between them last season.

true,datchilla,null,null,"Honestly, most of reddit is young.  They're at a point where they want to be advocates, but they don't know enough.  It takes people like alttt to have a discussion like the one we're having to bring more information to the table so that people can reach conclusions that are based off what's happening in reality versus what someone told someone else to tell you what's happening in reality. 

Some people don't understand this example:

A protest is organized and when it's happening a police officer beats up someone who wasn't being confrontational.  . The news reports that some people were severely injured at a peaceful protest,  and because that small rally is reported on more people hear about the rally and make a decision if they would be for it or against it.  The more discussions that happen the more people who are for or against it. 

Scenario 2: A protest is organized and goes according to the protesters plans, police don't beat up any one and have a light presence at the rally.  The local news instead of doing a segment on the rally (because of the beat downs in scenario 1) just do a snippet telling people that there was a rally in street so and so and that's the last people hear about it until there's another peaceful rally.

So the best way to curb disodents is to do nothing about it.   It's been shown that police intervention at political rallies does more damage to the ""status quo"" then not doing anything at all.  

My point is that young redditors don't understand this.  Sorry for the long explanation and Thanks for reading. ",0,1374534205,null,0,false,0,cb851ru,t3_1irsvg,t1_cb851ru,t1_cb7tv0b,null,1430373236,44,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,44

true,A_Hobbyist,null,null,"Any parent who takes the time to set up a computer with the pop up blocker and parental controls enabled can block almost all the content. A dedicated parent can go beyond that, researching tools like adblock and ghostery that can prevent even more unwanted things from appearing on their child's computer.

But every now and then those things get by even all of that, and it only takes one viewing for the exposure to be dangerous for some. What's a parent to do? Surely this governmental block of porn will keep out all the porn for those who don't want it right? Nothing can get by ISP's firewalls right? But even if you can block images and videos containing porn, how can you be sure you're child isn't being exposed elsewhere? That book with the cool cover your child got at the library might be erotic or even contain pornographic images itself. Even if you look ahead, sometimes you'll miss that and your child is exposed. So the library should ban any book sexual in nature. But those violent, senseless, and sexual video games, like saints row IV (which the Australian government originally had the good sense not to classify) are things your child could be exposed to at a friends house. Or a youtube video. or a gaming magazine article. But if you ban the game or force them to take out all violent and sexual content, THEN your child will be protected right? But if your child is in school, or some kind of group program, then other kids could expose him to those things you've worked to block from his view. He might even become attracted to one of his classmates himself. The government really should ban inappropriate conversations between classmates, then they'll stop talking about sex or exchanging explicit media. And across all these sources, There are more dangerous things than sex to ban. Violent movies, games, books, and ideas could corrupt our children into doing bad things they never would have done otherwise. Those shouldn't just be available. But not just pure violence, but evil ideas, like the extremist political philosophies that call for Naziism and anarchism, shouldn't be aloud. Why should you allow your child to be exposed to those evil ideas, or ideas that could do harm to the government, such as those who demand unabated access to sexual material on the internet?

But am I going to far with this sarcastic rant? After all, the government is not banning any of these things. Anyone can just choose to opt in for the explicit content. If you want you can opt in and They'll allow you to watch all the rape and torture porn you want. Because if you opt in, that's what you want. They won't ban any of those things above. You just have to tell them that you are a sexual deviant and have to have porn. When they decide that something needs to be banned, they won't ban it, they'll just frame it all as pure evil and force you to register for access, artificially pushing ideas to the fringes of society because they are troublesome to the government. You want to play a violent game? Just register on the violence simulator opt in form. You want to study different political ideas? Just opt in for the extremist/terror related political materials.


Of course, it would be too transparent to start a registry for all materials right now. They have to set the precedent of a registry first. So they'll start with porn. After all, think of the kids! Isn't just this one registry worth protecting your kids from violent rape and torture images?

* Stick to the blue colour scheme imo. In other words, I think the green and orange on the right sidebar are annoying. They draw too much attention. The good thing about blue shades is that they're cooler colours and so they drift into the background easily. The green and red pop out too much and take attention away from the submissions. To understand what I mean, read the submission titles and try to not notice the green on the right. See how it draws attention?
* Loving the hover/drop down menus. Much less clutter

true,spudboyblues,present,Mata,"This looks awesome. Few thoughts:

* Leave the Important reads section red, but I think the green is detracting for the upcoming fixture list. 

* As well - and maybe this is something for the mods - that fixture layout doesn't provide space for Home/Away. Perhaps it will read something like Man City (H) or Aston Villa (A), with the former being a home game and the latter being away. 

* I also don't know that I'm a fan of the big red subscribe button immediately adjacent to the ChelseaFC logo in the top left. Perhaps relocate it to just below the picture, above the search bar. 

* I miss the watermark in the background. Maybe that's nitpicky, but I think it looks classy.  

* It might be nice to have another section for Injuries and/or Transfers in/out, in addition to top scorers. Just a random thought.   

* Prefer the ""single"" to the ""alt single"" for comments. The hidden post command list might be confusing, and I agree that there is otherwise too much white space. 

As you can see my thoughts are rather nitpicky but hopefully constructive, because on the whole this is a bangin design.

For better or worse, there's still something 'dirty' about porn, whereas Page 3 is 'normal', which means its message ('men wear suits, football kit or combat fatigues and talk, women are naked and silent') is 'normal' too. 

I don't support a ban on either variety of porn (because of collateral damage censorship/anyone who thinks no western country would ever go the way of China or Russia is delusional and this is a step towards that). 

I personally think the moral fabric, that stops us from fostering creepy ideas about other people's bodies, is determined by what sort of economy we have. 

If it's okay for me to sack someone for fun, or if it's okay that someone in a wheelchair has their benefits cut off, or if it's okay to sell off the NHS and let those who can't afford private healthcare suffer - then that probably encourages us to think it doesn't really matter if someone was abused in the production of a porn video, and it doesn't really matter if young women get called 'slags or frigid' depending on whether they live up to the Page 3 model or not. 

If it's acceptable to exploit people financially, why not in every other sphere of life, considering how finance connects to everything in life?

e.g. Highway code states, you MUST wear a helmet (Highway Code rule 83) and SHOULD wear clothing that increases visibility (Highway Code 86 and 87). If you don't wear a helmet, you get 3 points and a fine - FIXED PENALTY. If you don't wear HIGH VIS....nothing happens as it isn't illegal.
so...
Highway code 244

You MUST NOT park partially or wholly on the pavement in London, and should not do so elsewhere unless signs permit it. Parking on the pavement can obstruct and seriously inconvenience pedestrians, people in wheelchairs or with visual impairments and people with prams or pushchairs.
Law GL(GP)A sect 15

Traffic Wardens may try and tell you it's wrong, but if it's outside of London it will get thrown out at magistrates should you appeal a ticket. It is not in the remit of parking attendants employed by the council to enforce this rule. 
Eight years ago I had a discussion with a traffic warden about this matter. After their advice of parking it in a loading bay instead of on the (very wide) pavement, I pointed out that this would just make it easier for them to give me a fixed penalty and I'll just leave it where it is. Not blocking the main walkway or doorway. They didn't write the ticket but went very red in the face. ;-)

As long as you use common sense and are courteous to people that use the footway, you're home and free. 

Good Luck out there and ride safe.

EDIT: coincidently if you ride the motorcycle on the pavement to park it. that's 3 pts and fixed penalty.

I can't see how you can be wary of the foreign markets after our last time in the PL yet be for offering massive wages when that was one of the other massive failures (arguably the biggest one, definitely more of one than the foreign imports, as we actually managed to shift those, while players like McShane, Bullard and Olofinjana proved impossible to get rid of, with Bullard only clearing off in exceptional circumstances)

Ultimately, I see why people might not be excited Sagbo but from what I understand, he offers attributes that none of our current attacking options have. Even if he isn't prolific, if he offers a focal point for attacks and counter attacks to occur around by holding up the ball while others break from deep to support (something that's very important with wing backs providing our width, especially against big teams), then I think he'll be a good signing.

British Board of Film Classification statement:

&gt;When the finished film was submitted to the BBFC in 1971 (by which time the age bar for seeing an X film had been raised from 16 to 18), **it was passed at X with no cuts.** At the time, the BBFC's Secretary, Stephen Murphy, **defended the film** by stating that:

&gt;""Disturbed though we were by the first half of the film, which is basically a statement of some of the problems of violence, we were, nonetheless, satisfied by the end of the film that it could not be accused of exploitation: quite the contrary, it is a valuable contribution to the whole debate about violence"".

&gt;In 1973, allegedly concerned about reports of copycat violence, and threats made to the safety of himself and his family, **Kubrick withdrew the film from circulation in the UK**. This was in spite of the fact that the film had been judged by the BBFC to be acceptable for public viewing for adults over the age of 18. At no time did the BBFC reject the film - although this is a common misconception - and it continued to be available throughout much of the rest of the world.

&gt;It was not until after Kubrick's death that his family agreed to permit the release of the film again. It was submitted to the BBFC in 1999 for a modern classification certificate and received an 18, without cuts, to replace its old X certificate.

I've had lectures at uni with representatives from the top record labels, music licensing companies, Spotify etc etc here in the UK, I am very well informed on the music industry from the inside. For all you know I could be an artist with a big enough fan base that it could warrant making enough money to live off through sales, yet it doesn't because they just download it. Yes there is an argument that unsigned indie artists with next to no fan base can benefit from pirating, the evidence and statistics against it is overwhelming (I probably could dig up the unions stats if you wanted). And yes I'm coming from the perspective of a good musician (not saying I am, though like many others it is my career prospect, behind the scenes and because there is less artists making money there is less job prospects) obviously the bad musicians won't sell songs and won't get paid, pirating makes no difference to them. 
Wether it helps artists or not, pirating is still stealing and for you for one minute to think it right is completely selfish and uninformed, imagine your line of work suddenly being free for anyone who wants to obtain it.
EDIT: Very Sorry for an angry reply, but as working in the music industry is my career prospect it can annoy me to see people promote piracy. I'd probably be all over the free ride if I didn't have my ambitions..

Just wanted to say that your last part about the project stopped me from voting for you.

As one Catholic who worked with him commented, ""Robert gave his life [for Northern Ireland]."" We must not forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in peace. 

I agree with the first sentence 100%. However you are obviously sympathetic towards Bradford and I happen to believe that it was the type of beliefs he held that allowed violence to continue for so long. As an MP he was a legislator for the ultra right-wing 'Never-give-an-inch/No Surrender type of politics that left so many Nationalists disillusioned with the state.

Not that I am defending his murder but I have found that those people who would venerate the likes of Robert Bradford have actually no interest in truly investigating the past or living in a shared society. For example they would never support the same type of investigation into murders committed by British soldiers or Police officers. They also tend to completely resent the idea of a truly 'Shared Society' where Irish and British nationalities are represented equally in the state.

Now obviously I don't know you at all and it is completely unfair of me to make these presumptions about you. But as a fellow journalist can I ask if I were investigating the similar murders committed by the British state would you be willing to help me?

true,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"Been using UJ since april. Had some interesting conversations about it with my signing guys.

Nobody casts more than a cursory glance at it, they don't have time. 

It's sparsely provided with jobs because virtually nobody advertises through the Jobcentre, and hasn't for the past 15 years to my certain knowledge. What jobs are there - in my area, anyway - are all Tupperware self-employment, Avon, dodgy get rich quick schemes or doorstep-hopping salespeople.

The Jobcentre frontline guys know how shit it is and sympathise entirely with what a ballache it is to have to do your jobsearch that way. They are also closely monitored, so they can't implicity say anything against the system and are bound by stupid office policy to insist on its' use.

There are so many holes in the system - a default 20 mile search radius, resulting in vacancies you couldn't possibly get to, no skills checklist like *every other jobsearch site* uses, no place to register simple but essential details like whether you have a driving license or not...I could go on.

The JC staff know this and sympathise. They hate it as much as you do. Some - at least in the Jobcentre I attend - are actively campaigning on our behalf, but it's difficult because they can just fire their arses and get a sycophant to fill their boots.

I use the activity log to leave very pointed and nasty comments about how crappy the site is. I know nobody will read it, but it makes me feel better...",0,1374541812,null,0,false,0,cb87omk,t3_1iukux,t1_cb87omk,t3_1iukux,null,1430371994,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

China uses internet filtering to advance political causes at the cost of human rights; the US/Australia/EU uses internet filtering to advance human rights at the cost of political ideals.




I'm not exactly sure how human rights besides your own fit into your ethos. Your ""sources"" imply that efforts to stop the most insidious of human rights abuses are unjust. *How is the violation of a human's most basic right of individual autonomy comparable to your own ""rights"" to access gambling and porn?!* 

Concerted efforts to stop actual violations of human rights are far from evidence the world is headed towards global dystopia a la *1984*.  Halting the propagation of child porn is paramount to the abolition of sexual slavery-I have no idea how you can think your ""rights"" take precedence over those who have none.




Ignoring the equivocations and doublethink, speaking only of the initial issue-I see no problem with opting in to receive porn. Generally it presents a distorted and fake view of sexuality, but if you're an adult, you can have the right to access it. 

However, children are much more impressionable then adults; they lack the abstract form of executive control a fully developed mind has. It's negligent to give your child an uncontrolled device from which they can find such material which can warp perceptions.

I wouldn't say it's abusive, merely because people may simply be naive or too ""technologically impaired"" to set up parental controls. Whitelists for porn stop potential unintentional negligence ; if a parent doesn't specifically request porn in their household, it's not there to access.

The default should not be free access to obscene materials; a click through screen is hardly a robust verification of identity. Porn has huge potential for harm, at least in it's current state of fake, degrading performances. It portrays sex as a physical, isolated act, and removes any emotional connection around sexual gratification.

Guns are just guns. They have but one function. They were specifically designed for this sole purpose. Having special expanding bullets to maximize carnage, to pierce protection, to ignite shit, designed for them. There's a clear difference between guns and all the rest. You have to admit it.
Basically the debate on guns is wether or not you have the right to carry such a pandora box.
How much suicides or domestic accidents by guns ? 

Also, I don't agree with the argument that guns don't kill people , people kill people. I think that an object ""calls"" for its usage and that many people aren't much smarter than the object itself. Finger+trigger+squeeze = huge consequences.

It's too fucking easy.

&gt;Furthermore, I think it is good that our head of state is not another corrupt politician who is only out to line their own pockets, we have enough of them in the House of Commons.

Being from the US, I'm beyond tired of corrupt politicians. Whenever I'm out and about with well-educated, young professionals, a common theme arises during conversations on politics: the system doesn't work, our way of life is guided by the most greedy and corrupt amongst us, the rich continue to get richer and the poor keep getting poorer, and there is nothing that any of us can do about it. People feel totally helpless and have no idea what to do. With that in mind, I definitely understand your comment about corrupt politicians. 

But it seems to me--and correct me if I'm wrong--that the role of the royal family is largely ceremonial and that they remain largely impartial to the whims of politics. Don't you already have an elected head of state? That's essentially what your Prime Minister is (in a matter of speaking). 

&gt; Besides, I think it is good to have some celebrity role models that are not always stuffed full of drugs and drinking themselves to death.

Being from the land of the ""free"" and the home of the incessant celebrity gossip, I hear you on that. But it seems to me that there *are* role models who aren't druggies and alcoholics, and that gossip rags essentially focus on those who are because they drive sales. Is the royal family really necessary in this respect?

true,wilsonsmilson,null,null,"&gt;They never said The Silence. Its implied but never explicitly stated and Moffat has alluded to it not being them at all but another threat.

It's implied.  So it comes to a matter of preference.  Do you need an alien twirling his mustache hitting a detonator.  Or let the writer let go of your hand and trust you'll be able to surmise a bit here and there without everything being minutely spelled out for a 45 min show.

&gt;No they're not. The Silence are part of the proclaimed Academy which are a bigger group hellbent on stopping The Doctor.

Yes, I stated that.  So you and I both agree.  So that's been answered.

&gt;He never defeated nor tricked them. There was more Silence than just on Earth. We've seen them on other planets for God sake. Again moot point that doesn't work.

The silence aliens on Earth are throughout time up until 1969 when the doctor tricks them into destroying themselves (assuming majority.)  Other aliens we see are specific to the 51st 53rd century (when river song is grabbed at the university.)  We also see them in tanks in the alternate universe where all time is happening at once.  The aliens saw The Doctor die at Lake Silencio/then proceeds to turn the humans against them, the doctor defeated The Church and the Headless Monka at Demon's Run, made River good, Kovarian dies in the alternate and the aliens turn on her for her failure.  Then he falls into the shadows to meet his fate at trenzalore.

&gt;Her sole mission wasn't to just raise Melody. Her mission was to kill The Doctor, Melody was just her ""bigger"" weapon for doing so. And she's not crazy as she doesn't remember her alternate timeline. Only those exposed to the TARDIS do. The Doctor even states this when Amy questions if it still happened or not.

I didnt say she was crazy.  Amy tells River she remembers killing Kovarian.  She then asks ethically what does it mean that she remembers if it didnt happen.  So one can assume that madame kovarian remembers.  Say that's not the case though.  Kovarian then either believes she succeeded when the doctor died at silencio, or knows he survived and failed.  Either way the group The Silence is as you put it a moot point.

Not the guy you are responding to, but I would like to explain the reasoning behind why this is not an adequate theory, and to explain it I will be using inter state relations as an example. First, let me point our your logic vs that of people who argue for gun control. Your argument is that as long as everyone has guns nobody has any reason to fight. The gun control advocate's argument is that the less destructive weapons people have the less likely people have to use them due to a smaller difference in firepower. Now, let me explain why the gun control theory tends to be more favourable. Countries fought wars before the advent of nuclear weapons, because they thought that they had the advantage, now sometimes they were wrong, in the same way a criminal entering a house might be wrong about the guns a owner has, but most of the time they were right. This is how stuff functioned both at a state and at a personal level until a great arbitrator came in that favoured the statuo quo. In history this was the United Kingdom, in our world this is the police, it is to their advantage to keep stuff calm so they keep it that way. Other countries or people are more cautious in acts of aggression unless they know that they can seize the initiative and complete their goal before a response came. Now, the problem with the guns theory is unless there is a mutually assured loss, there will always be parties willing to take the risk, they will think they have better marksmanship, aim, or whatever. There is no way that there will be a power that assures mutual destruction that would be allowed for civilian use. There are no nuclear weapons of household defense. I mean look at world war 1, with the arms build up and posturing that preceded it, it all seemed so unlikely due to the risks involved to all parties, yet because states, who are run by human beings, are irrational, it happened. Now the theory of gun control is that criminals are cheap, and because maintaining higher end guns are expensive, they only will want enough to achieve their goals, if all points are banned, all they would carry would be knifes more than likely. This reduces the risk in a robbery to all parties involved by causing minimal damage in case of use and lowering the risk of robbery due to the fact that a knife is within reaching distance. Now I am not advocating for knife control for practical reasons, you see my point, gun advocates theory on violence to prevail requires an escalation of arms, and gun control advocates accept crime as a reality and try to mitigate damage and increase the ability to fight back by minimal arms.

true,bluenaut,null,null,"&gt;The truth of the matter is that there is always going to be inequality, and a symbolic gesture to deny this (like abolishing the monarchy) isn't going to achieve anything.

Inequality in some form will always exist, but the issue is to what degree. To an outsider like myself, it seems entirely odd to have a state-subsidized celebrity family that lives a life of opulence simply because they're the biological offspring of a former monarchy. I think that abolishing this institution would be a *very* important symbolic measure in advocating for more equality and equity. And yes, I do realize that it would take a lot more--including the addressing the issue of corrupt politicians, business leaders, and a hard look at modern capitalism--to make any effective strides. But can you really take seriously any calls to address the gaps between the wealthy and the working poor when the royal family is given a free pass?

&gt;The UK (or whatever it would be called) will undoubtedly be worse off economically and culturally without the monarchy.

How would the non-existence of the royal family make a negative impact in the day to day happenings of the average UK citizen? I can't imagine my life being enriched because the offspring of long-dead kings and queens are living a life of luxury. Not trying to be rude here, but the idea that this arrangement enriches the lives of anyone other than the royals and their network seems very, very bizarre to me (which is why I'm here asking this question). 

&gt;Yes, it is a silly thing to adore people because of their birth, but when so many do, who are we to deny them this because we have some 'it's for your own good' notion of equality?

Why should we *not* deny them this arrangement? After all, many citizens are forced to spend the majority of the prime hours of the best days of the majority of their lives engaged in various forms of work that often bring little or no intellectual stimulation or enjoyment--tasks that they're forced to do simply because they aren't born with access to capital. To allow the offspring of this family to live in very, very extreme luxury while millions struggle to make ends meet and are denied the opportunity to live their life the way they want seems, at least to me, highly offensive. I suppose I'm trying to understand why so many UK citizens seem to feel differently. Instead of rejoicing in the unequal arrangements of the past, shouldn't we look towards a future where there is a more level playing field in life?

However I will concede that illegally owned firearms contribute considerably to violence. Although I WOULD never join a group like the NRA I would agree with their one point that criminals with arms cause most of the problems with gun violence. Its the primary problem with ""stand your ground"" laws. They have actually been used as a defense by convicted felons that have used a firearm in the  ""self defense"" of defending a drug territory. It happened in Miami, and was actually on ""The First 48"", the show about homicide detectives. 
My personal view on gun laws are that they belong in the category of ""State's Rights"" or more precisely a ""local rights""  in that gun ownership is much more likely to be deadly in urban populations than in rural ones. My county likely has near 99% gun ownership rate (rural Georgia) and a Mayberry like crime rate. Move 50 miles and Atlanta has a reputation (earned) as one of the more violent cities in America and likely has a 20% or less LEGAL ownership rate.

I think they are an important part of our cultural heritage. While yes, they do live in luxury, they do provide a lot of income for the country (not just through tourism but from rent from the land they own - land that the government couldn't take away even if the monarchy was abolished), money which can go towards benefit payments or other government expenditure. And like someone else said below, the monarchy is very popular. The republican movement in this country is very small, as most people actually do like the monarchy.

And no, the Queen is our Head of state (and the head of state of the various Commonwealth realms too, including Canada and Australia), but the Prime Minister just runs the country. He (or she as it was once before) is not the Head of State. An interesting fact is that technically, the Queen DOES have a hell of a lot of power, it is just that power can only be used by the Prime Minister under what is known as the Royal Prerogative. The PM doesn't have any powers of his own, he just technically only has the power of the sovereign. This is mostly centred around appointing people to various positions, and doesn't have much to do with the day to day running of the country which is dealt with in Cabinet. With elected politicians. But while this power technically belongs to the sovereign, if she tried to use it she would just be quietly taken into a back room and asked to abdicate.

And yes, they are LARGELY impartial towards politics, but then again they are not. It is rather difficult to explain, and the Queen is more of an advisor to the PM and represents the interests of the country as a whole rather than just that politician's supporters. The PM does have a weekly meeting with the Queen, and although it is a very confidential meeting it is obvious they discuss the important matters of the day in proper British style, not the mud slinging contests you see in the Commons. But it is pretty much a taboo for the Royals to speak out about politics in public, which is why Charles is quite unpopular. He has spoken out on several issues, most notably conservation and also matters relating to our cultural heritage sites and listed buildings.

So to sum up: The monarchy is popular, quite a few people will be sad if it goes (me included). It is an important to our history and cultural heritage for them to be there to do their ceremonial roles (I love watching the Trooping of the Colour- can you imagine if the Guards had to parade around for David Cameron?). Finally, they do provide quite a substantial amount of money for the economy, both in tourist pounds and rent from their lands.

I can understand your argument, but I just do not see how removing the much-loved monarchy would actually benefit US in any way. ",0,1374547068,null,0,false,0,cb89jrm,t3_1iuoow,t1_cb89jrm,t1_cb88p4n,null,1430371044,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

By using it as a shield this also prevents anyone from actually calling this out because if you say how awful this is you're automatically treated like a pedophile and a pervert because technologically incompetent people don't understand anything about the internet.

That said, I've been of the camp that we really don't need any fullbacks at the moment. At least not unless they're a serious upgrade, and I only see Cissokho as slightly lesser than Enrique. Even if he is better, I can only imagine it being marginally so.

I'd much rather prefer a similar deal for DM cover. Perhaps there aren't any players in the market who could come like this. 

I have to feel the greatest worry we have as a club right now is Lucas pulling up with an injury and having to rely upon Allen or Hendo to be our starting DM. They just don't have the skill set to get that done. Both can be fantastic players for us, just not at that position. 

After that I'd say we need to get a backup keeper whose more capable than Jones. Not for competition but if Mignolet gets injured.

After that perhaps you look at LB cover.

Do you think that the fact that so many of your minor thugs are packing heat is somewhat linked to with how many legal guns are infesting the country? Said guns that will be stolen and resold to black market... What do you make of escalation ? You start to have guns? Sure the thugs will start to have bigger, nastier ones in response: the predator adapt to its prey. 
We have no guns here, so the predator doesn't need to have one, he won't have to nervously point a gun at us fearing that we may be packing and shooting our faces because, a squeeze is so easily triggered.

For our thugs to have guns, they must be, at least, big drug sellers (selling canabis by the hundreds of kg, every day) or mafia, or serial bank robbers.Basically, guns don't concern the average citizen, at all.

I insist: having legal guns is a big mistake and leads to really shitty consequences.

I assume we're playing a 4-3-3 or more accurately a 4-2-3-1. So you've got Gerrard and Lucas. Are we going to start Allen with them?

I also think we lose some of our cutting edge, even if they find a way to play Allen with Gerrard and Lucas, because in effect you have 2 distributors who can't beat players in the dribble. This puts all the emphasis on our front 3, which will have trouble in the final third with the deep midfield we'll have to play due to having no legs.

true,gotta_Say_It,null,null,"Yes, this is because you are playing the fall guy by playing by one code of rules.  If you've ever argued with a religious person about religion you'll notice how they start with facts but when they run into a tough patch they revert to magic or ""because god said so"" and they then let you know you lost the argument and they won.  This is because you're only debating facts.  The solution is to go wherever you need to in order to win.  Is your goal to win the argument or to argue only on the high road?  As aggravating as these people are, I play to win and to slam it in their face while I'm at it, after all I need some fun too.  So now there are no illusions between us, we both know they are going to pull bullshit at some point so don't wait for it because it will weaken your point.  You need to take the attack to them and get them on the defense.  For example, in the above argument I would not even attempt the ""they have every right to love someone"" argument, go right to the TRUE heart of the matter and say something like, ""You must hate gays because you were told to by some religion? A religion based on hate is what is wrong with this world and is what causes terrorists and terrorism! That's a crazy statement, are you an extremist or something?""  Now you are taking the attack instead of playing a loosing game of only defenses.  Anyone that has played sports knows that you can't win only playing defense all the time.  Now that you have accused them they will need to defend, and that will look like they are extremist but defensive about it.  You win.  Remember to let them know you won and that the argument is over even when they are like ""no, no, listen I'm not done!""

&gt; This is where the tinfoil hats come in. You're making assumptions.

Actually, no. I don't care what the original intent was. I care about what inevitably happens afterwards, which is increased censorship. It doesn't matter if the tools for this are created with total censorship in mind, or if the idea/possibility of total censorship is created by the tools becoming available. 

And once the tools are in place it is incredibly easy to covertly add censorship of whatever you want. Someone finds out or complains?

*""Police confirmed that the mans' internet access had been restricted after it had tripped the anti-child pornography filter system implemented by the government""*

... and good luck getting anybody to believe you after that.

&gt;Also, you can't have your cake and eat it too. We definitely want to ban child porn. Should we restrict ourselves from banning it due to the fear that it might incite other bans? I would argue no. 

I would argue yes. You can't censor the entire medium because you want to censor something specific that is distributed via the medium.

She laughed to herself as she decided to leave him a message along the lines of ""I'm dying of boredom here. Come get me so we can go have some fun with Jim the fish, Sweetie."" She sent it to his psychic paper, knowing he would get it eventually but not knowing *when* he would get it. She included Jim the fish so she could tease him with spoilers if he wasn’t there yet in his timeline. 

Within seconds she was forced to smile in anticipation as the familiar sound of the Doctor driving the TARDIS waved over her ears. She hastily ran to her bed and grabbed a book so she could look indifferent when he saw her. The TARDIS door opened and shut. River slowly peeked over her book and saw the Doctor. 

It wasn't *her* Doctor, but he was The Doctor. This was made evident to River as he gave her a wide goofy smile and asked, ""Jellybaby?""

River opened her cell door and looked the man who would eventually grow to be everything she ever wanted. She longed to tell him everything. She always did when she saw him. Instead, she questioned, ""What is it with you and hats?""  As she spoke she slowly lifted his hat off his head and placed it atop her hair.
She then slowly pulled his scarf off of his neck and placed it around her own, “The hats were enough of a bother, but the scarf? That’s going a bit too far don’t you think Sweetie?”

The Doctor laughed. He then quietly stared at her for a minute. River nervously swallowed, their entire relationship could change because of this simple exchange. Their relationship could live or die in this very short moment. “So…” He finally spoke, “Who is this ‘Jim the fish’ hmm?”
River laughed heartily again, they were back in her comfort zone. She put a finger to his lips as she whispered “Oohhh, spoilers Sweetie.”

true,reepicheepi,null,null,"I don't understand it. I especially don't understand it when it comes to countries like Australia.

I can't think of any good reason for the monarchy. They might just be 'mascots' of a state, but mascots mean something.... these particular mascots mean that power and privilege in this particular place are things that can be earned by birthright. Britain is a society that still functions very much along class lines, and the existence of a monarchy only confirms that, and you're right, this baby is being born into a life of incredible privilege in a society that is deeply unequal (and traumatised, remember the London riots?)

Everyone is basically saying: no matter what this baby grows up to be like, he deserves to be the head of state; there is no one in this country who is smart or interesting or respectful enough to represent us, we have to rely on this one family to keep churning out our leaders. I can slightly accept this argument when it comes to the UK, but what about countries like Australia and NZ? There is no one who represents the cultural values of those countries better than some rich British kid? I don't accept the monarchy as a benign institution: no institution that allows for people to EARN incredible privilege by coming out of a specific womb and nothing else can be benign. The Queen is a nice lady, sure, but I can think of plenty of nice people I nevertheless wouldn't want as head of state. 

As for 'they do nothing', the attorney-general removed an Australian PM as recently as 1975. We recently learned that Prince Charles had been offered secret veto's on legislation affecting his 'private interests' which have included things like the Olympics. The existence of the monarchy also means that Britain has an unwritten constitution - there are pros and cons to that - but it makes changing the constitution easier than in states like the US where the constitution is codified, and means that (apart from the overwhelming powers like the ECHR), there is relatively absolute parliamentary sovereignty. A republic might mean that Britain would have to have a very real debate about what its constitution should be and what its core values should be. People go on and on about politicians being 'corrupt', but what's less accountable? At least an elected head of state would have to strive for values like transparency and accountability. If we're so worried about the corrupting influence of politicians why have them at all? Why not just let the Queen make all the rules? Because clearly a democracy is preferable. 

I don't accept 'they bring in tourism money' as a legitimate argument. Who comes to the UK thinking they're going to get to look at the queen? If anything, you could open up all the palaces etc like Versailles and have people troop through them and earn more tourist revenue that way. If bringing in tourist money is a legitimate reason for being head of state then Harry Potter should be it: after all, what's less ridiculous, a fictional boy wizard or this one random mostly-German family? Getting rid of the monarchy isn't going to delete Britain of its history or get rid of the pomp and circumstance, these things will always be in its cultural make up. The Crown Estate, despite that one very misleading video going around the internet, will continue to earn revenue for the treasury, monarchy or not. The royals can continue to work for charities and the military as private citizens. It is an outdated institution, and it's sad to see how something as dopey as a wedding or pregnancy can be so effectively spun as PR. I would prefer that communal fantasies about princesses are kept in the confines of Disneyland and not allowed to govern great economic and political powers in 2013.

All this being said - I can't see the monarchy going away. I honestly think part of the reason Britain still has one, as opposed to countries like the United States, is because it doesn't have the self confidence not to have one. You have to be patriotic and believe in the greatness of your country in the current time and its future to have the theatre and drama that surrounds an ordinary person like Obama being president and for that role to be respected, and I can't imagine Britain ever valuing a 'commoner' that way, not even one they chose... it's far less embarrassing to believe that an old lady deserves it all because she's there by divine right, and, oh well, we're just repeating the ceremonial stuff we've always done, just because.

The very nature of The Doctor is a man who is eccentric and brilliant, inquisitive, charming, unflappable and still somehow light-hearted. Tom Baker exemplified that in spades.

The best way to describe him--I think--is if you splice together Sherlock Holmes and Santa Clause. And yet, Tom's Doctor is altogether a distinctive character unto itself.

You know how some actors play The Doctor, and some actors *ARE* The Doctor? That's Tom. He was The Doctor like Gene Wilder was Willy Wonka, like Johnny Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, like Robert Englund is Freddy Krueger.

And, ultimately, everyone has their favorites. Some feel just as passionate about each of the other Doctors. And that's fine.

I just treated my test like it was another lesson, and tried not to over think anything with regards to minors and majors ( I did balls up at one point and forgot to put my side mirror back to a proper position after having lowered it to do a reverse around a corner, but noticed about 10ft from when I set off again and asked to pull over and correct it - got a minor for it)

true,Jaihom,null,null,"&gt; Compare the number of murders in Illinois with low per capita gun ownership to the number of murder in Montana, which has extremely high per capita gun ownership.

They're two states in the same country with the same federal firearm legislation and no real way to stop the flow of firearms across state borders. Really shitty premise. 

&gt;Also consider that after Australia's de facto gun ban, their violent crime rate dropped 20%. In the US, during the same time period, we experienced over 200% increase in guns per capita and a 60% drop in violent crime.

Completely hollow comparison. First off, do both countries define ""violent crime"" the same? Nope. Secondly, you can't cherry pick two countries. Thirdly, violent crime rates are not just affected by gun ownership, so you haven't isolated your variables and your comparison is invalid. Fourth-ly, you're using rather misleading statistics. The number of guns per capita is a less useful metric than the number of people/households that own guns (and this is on the decline). A person with several guns isn't more likely to commit a crime using said guns than a person who only has one (especially when we're talking about legal ownership).

As far as more guns not causing more shootings, here is some much more telling evidence: 

http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/50cf5c5eecad049f7a000004-590-/deaths-vs-guns.png

http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/50cf5dcfeab8ea856300000c-1735-1508/homicide-vs-guns.png

Compare those two graphs and take this from it: The number of guns has a much smaller affect on homicides than it does gun deaths. This is because you've failed to consider the fact that while reducing the number of guns might not substantially reduce total violent crime, it will completely eliminate accidental deaths and it will save a lot of lives. You're much less likely to die of a stab wound than you are of a gunshot wound.

As far as whether or not this means we should ban the manufacture/sale/possession/whatever of guns in a country where there are already plenty of guns in circulation both legally and illegally is a different matter, but to say more guns doesn't lead to more shooting is just totally bonkers.",0,1374557414,null,0,1374558046,0,cb8cvap,t3_1irsvg,t1_cb8cvap,t1_cb83tia,null,1430369479,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I worked in that domain for a number of years so I felt I had some authority on explaining the advertising landscape. I explained cookie &amp; ip tracking and how companies make data purchases to aggregate data. I explained you can signup for an account and only provide minimal information (such as email, first/last name, zip code, DOB, etc) and companies can figure out the rest by making data purchases to fill in your phone, address, past addresses, relatives, income range, property ownership, credit rating, etc.

This data comes from a variety of directories, companies, government agencies. I also explained how different websites can share data to build a behavioral profile of your surfing and purchases. They can share your purchase history so website ABC can know what you purchases on website XYZ. All this data runs through statistical analysis algorithms to determine the best targeted advertisements to send to you  via banners, keyword search, email, snail mail, direct phone sales, text marketing, etc.

She and another atheist buddy did the same thing that time. Called me a conspiracy nut. I was trying to explain to her that I knew this because I actually worked on data merges for my old employer. Periodically they made data buys and I had to normalize and clean up the data, load it into an Oracle database, and run some queries to join it with our existing data.  This was way back in 2004 so our data aggregation was pretty simplistic compared to what Google, Facebook, and credit card companies do.

(Btw, I'm an atheist so I'm not trying to pick on atheists. It's just some of them go nuts with the skepticism and demands for evidence.

My issue now is that once this is in, it'll set a precedent. Once porn is filtered at a national level, perhaps they could look at filtering out extremist political groups? EDL website gets blocked - people might think that's OK. Then the BNP; not too many people would lose sleep over that one either.

But what then? There's a thin line between blocking extremist views and stifling legitimate free speech. Once we've started that, it's a relatively small move into blocking things that the government just aren't comfortable with. This thread is full of people criticising our government for this move, and we're free to do so. Not everybody in every nation has that privilege. Suppose I set up a website that was critical of some policy or other - what if that got blocked?  How would you feel if you had to put your name on a list to view things that were critical of the status quo?

I'm not saying that will happen, and I really hate to use the term 'slippery slope', but that could be just what we're starting on.

The best defense against attack is never becoming a target in the first place. Not saying the old ""nothing to hide, ect"" thing. Remember, the NSA literally writes the book on cryptography. You really have two options: never connect your computer to any other computer, or network and risk compromization.

Of course, risk can be mitigated. But if they really want in to your machine, all the major intellegence agencies have zero day exploits on your OS, half a dozen stack overflow vurnerabilities in every one of your programs, and a backdoor in your router. Scratch that, the router's just china's

Seriously, don't piss off the intel community. One swipe of a pen and bam, rootkits and RATs galore on every machine that's ever been within 100 feet of you.

All joking aside, your point is absolutely right. I used Papadopoulos as an example of a certain profile, that players with injury backgrounds who might end up good. Obviously, there have been players who come back even better after early injuries, and there have also been players who seem plagued by small niggling injuries their whole career. In the case of Papadopoulos, there is every possibility of him having an actual chronic problem, and what better way to be certain than to have him on the treatment table at Melwood? :)

Also, my post was obviously not intended to influence the club's policy. It was more of a call for Liverpool fans to moderate their own expectations. It's fun and all to dream of us having the likes of Marco Reus and Thomas Mueller on the flanks, but the fact is that these players are far beyond our reach. I feel that if we took our circumstances into account, we could come up with better discussions on players that could fit the mold at Liverpool.

My personal experiences have included being called ""evil"" by a door to door charity worker for not wanting to donate to a children's charity.
My aunt had a child and was handed one of these [leaflets](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6466277.stm) as she left hospital.

I have also heard of regular donors being emotionally blackmailed to increase their monthly gift, so on the phone you would hear ""If you actually care about the thousands of abused children in this country Mr X you'll increase your donation by £5 a month. Without that increase children will die that didn't need too"" etc. etc.

Needless to say my experiences may not be typical, and I'm sure there are a lot of very dedicated, hardworking people at the NSPCC. It's just the way they go about asking for money is nasty in my mind.

It feels nice to get all up in arms and to rally together against something so we can all feel a part of a struggle. Again, especially if you don't get the opportunity to very often. It's a big chunk of the world that's very important to a lot of people on reddit because porn is just a tab away and you can do all your moaning and cod philosophising without having to leave your seat. It also makes you look somewhat interesting because you care about stuff. 
  
Also, it's something that's being put between them and sexual gratification. Which is psychologically dangerous ground to be on.  
  
Especially when you're not too far from puberty and your sexual identity has just about settled and you've become comfortable with heterosexual impulses and you know you don't need to be ashamed and now all of a sudden someone is telling you that it's wrong.

I don't think anyone's saying they're ""disgusting"".  They might seem odd/unsettling to some people, probably because they struggle to identify with wanting to read such literature, but not ""disgusting"".

My impression of this thread is actually the opposite of what you describe.  These books are given as an example of the kinds of things that, on the surface, *could be construed as offensive*, but actually aren't. Even for people who don't ""get"" them, there's no harm to anybody in writing, selling or reading them.

The point of this thread is to illustrate that things depicting rape -- or, in the case of (some of) these books, describing child sexual abuse -- actually cause no harm and should not be banned.

I actually spoke to the examiner... I figured that if I show that I'm relaxed (even if I wasn't inside) the examiner might sense I was a more capable driver. When you're on a lesson with your instructor, this is what probably happens anyway, you chat about general things as you're driving. So, in the test, sitting at traffic lights and when driving, the examiner would ask general questions like, ""what do you do"" etc. Just strike up general conversation, but of course keep your concentration. So just treat it as another lesson and RELAX.
 
Also, make sure you're looking in your mirrors always. You've had three tests already, so you also know what to expect. 

It was a great relief passing it in the end, and the number of times taken to pass doesn't really matter. I say people who pass their test first time are actually worse drivers, as people taking more than one attempt and passing are usually more careful drivers in the future.

Interesting choice for him.

Assuming the suspect illegal material WAS on the hard drive, and this wasn't an unfortunate coincidence of a false allegation against a privacy campaigner.

Had he given up the password he would be facing no prison sentence, but rather a community order, PLUS a child porn conviction, plus entry on the sex offenders registers. He may have escaped with just a caution, but that is probably unlikely, given it was encrypted.

Instead he chose a 16 week sentence, with about 8 weeks to serve, but no child porn conviction. 

He will have to declare this for longer when applying for jobs: a year for a community order, versus 2 years for the short prison sentence, based on changes due to come into force shortly. However, if he got a 12 month community order this period wouldnt start until the end of sentence so this is irrelevant.

On balance it probably still seems worth it too me. Sure, a lot of people will see the ""failure to disclose the password"" and assume what it means, but a lot won't know, and a lot will give him the benefit of the doubt, especially his family.

Its also possible there was evidence of rather worse crimes than mere possession, such as records of him carrying out abuse, in which case the decision was a no brainer.

The major downside is that his choice attracted press attention, whereas a regular child porn conviction probably wouldn't have. As it is, now he is enormously googleable, and his name is instantly associated with the crime, and his picture shows up. Probably a more difficult consequence to forsee.

The block itself will work in a similar way to how BT/O2/any other provider already has 'parental lock' functions (or similar) - they'll do packet sniffing and stop anything that is on their block list.  Obviously the problems are that you are basically chasing your tail because you'll have to be constantly updating your list and there is the potential for false positives (O2 blocks the BNPs website, for example, for reasons that are a bit beyond my comprehension - probably that someone doesn't like it).",0,1374571576,null,0,false,0,cb8fiqm,t3_1iv7wj,t1_cb8fiqm,t1_cb8ct8i,null,1430368230,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,BlueStarsong,null,null,"*I'll stick a TL;DR at the bottom.*

**I was discussing this with a friend on skype who made some extremely valid points some of you may wish to include in your messages to MPs.**

""If there's an actual separation between the state and religion, then why is sex seen as shameful and immoral? It's recreation, required for the propogation of the state, and most, an inherent part of the human - or in fact, living - condition. Censoring any part of it, especially ""to stop children seeing it"" is foolish. It's going to make no difference, since the effort to block piracy has meant I need to type ""pirateproxy"" instead of ""piratebay"", and it's going to teach more children how to do actually dangerous things.

I wouldn't have bothered learning how to bypass internet filters if they'd just let me play my shitty flash games in school, for example. Now look at me. *(Written by a security specialist.)*

That said, the ""frontier town"" attitude of the internet a decade ago - shit, I sound old - can't last forever, so I suppose it's just a microcosm of meatspace. Shit gets regulated, harmless misdemeanors get driven underground, people turn to actual dangers. You force people into the deepweb because they want to jack off, you've only got yourself to blame when they resurface knowing something harmful.

Oh, and if you want some technology to be scared of, check out the black hat conference. Some guys have built a device that can remotely cut the brakes of electronic cars, lock the steering and override the doors. Cost them $25 for parts.""

I believe the main thing to take away from this is that it's going to teach people how to find more dangerous things. A kid can't get 1. through the filter at home and his mate tells him to grab TOR. He's now swapping web pages with other TOR users while he browses YouTube or whatever, since that is apparently blocked on the mobile version. 

**(For those who don't know about TOR, one of the functions of it is that when one user types in an address, someone else using the tor network will grab that for you and sends it to you, and you do the same for someone else, swapping user every processor turn. This can be perfectly innocent but it really depends on who you're matched with in the onion.)**

Alright, back to the example. This kid is now on TOR and whoever the network has chosen to grab his youtube for him is a known offender. He logs into youtube and bam, his log-in is now associated with the IP of this known offender. Meanwhile, he's downloading pages for other users in the background and providing them with a means to avoid their filters, lets say this kid is just browsing the cbbc.co.uk forums, and has forgotten to come off of TOR and go onto whatever browser his parents have chosen for him. He makes 100 web page loads whilst browsing the forums for half an hour, meaning 100 different people downloading his page for him and sending it to him. He does this for 100 other people in turn, passively. How many of those 100 people using TOR doing so to get something definitely illegal, which is now associated with this kid?

This is *before* his friend tells him he can find cool things on the silk road.

true,kayleighswift,sussex,Sussex,"Dear [MP],

I am writing regarding the recent news regarding the introduction of 'opt-out' pornography filters in the UK.

There are many reasons this is a bad idea, not least because it is plain and simple censorship, but I would like to share with you a reason that is more close to my own personal experiences.

One thing we have seen in previous attempts to block pornography is that legitimate websites, in particular those of an LGBTQ nature, tend to get caught in the net. While you will probably go on to reassure me that everything will be done to prevent this from happening, I know full well that these filters are simply not up to the task of blocking only pornographic content and nothing else.

This new legislation has been wrapped up in the old ""protecting children"" idea but it shows full well that the Prime Minister has failed to take into account some of the most vulnerable members of our young society - those struggling with their sexual and/or gender identity.

Many young people who are discovering themselves turn to the internet for help - many do not feel able to talk to their parents, friends or doctors just yet - the internet is great in this respect because it allows them to explore themselves and the LGBTQ community anonymously, at their own pace.

The danger is that, as we have seen in the past, many LGBTQ related websites, particularly smaller, community and social websites (which sometimes turn out to be the most friendly and helpful) have been caught up in these filters - leaving vulnerable young people unable to reach out and unable to know that there are others like them, and to help them find the support they need.

Blocking pornography will do nothing to protect children. We already know that most kids are smart enough to circumvent any filters that are put in place (just look at the farcical attempt to block The Pirate Bay - the website is now more popular than ever! That block backfired a fair bit, didn't it?), but will do much harm to the most needy members of our society.

Mr Loughton, I urge you to vote against and help to block these ill thought out plans which are quite clearly nothing more than propaganda.

Protecting children from sexual internet content is the responsibility of the parents - not society. Filters are simply imperfect. Children will circumvent them anyway.

Yours sincerely,

[ME]

true,alexropo,flair8,,"- How do you see Chadli fitting into Spurs

Looks like he's got the size that AVB and Levy have been brining into the squad. From what I've seen (very little) he has an eye for goal but isn't a slouch when it comes to passing. I believe we might be looking at a replacement for Dempsey to some extent but I really think we should be looking at depth in stead of offloading all the players that aren't starting every game.

- Do you believe he will start against Palace?  

No, but I can see him starting our later stage Preseason games or at least getting a 45 minute run out. Seems like he should fit right in with the Moose and Vertonghen around, but its a very different game, the PL, and I don't quite think Lennon will be losing his spot this early in the campaign. However if Bale's knock worsens and he can't start against Palace i'd have 50/50 odds between him and Townsend.

- Hopes/expectations

I've loved to see how physically imposing our team is becoming. With Bale improving from already devastating form it'll be nice to have someone open when Bale is triple-marked. I think it'll be good for Lennon also, who isn't stupid and knows he needs his final ball to be better so we may see him try to improve that aspect greatly to stay on the starting XI, but it could go both ways, he may end up losing confidence and gifting the spot to Nacer. Chadli looks to have great skill on the ball, but I haven't watched any full games of his so i can only assume he isn't wasteful of possession. He looks fairly creative also which is super exciting. I'm super excited.

Again this is simply statistics not social engineering - the exam coaching available at private schools appears to bump their A level grades higher and thus their subsequent University performance is not as good as state school applicants with the same grades. Making lower offers to state school applicants or higher offers to private school applicants is simply a corrective mechanism to this - no more unfair than the exam curves commonly employed at many institutions.

* Every now and then even people who are couples or married may go on the Internet to view some porn. What if that other person finds out about it?

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"You see though, this is the crux of it. Titillation isn't sex, it is the denial of sex that creates frustration with no reward. I mean, unless you're about 12 and discovering your repressed sexuality for the first time, most titillating pictures this will catch your eye but they won't truly arouse you. As a result they keep sex on your mind and build up some abstract concept of ""sexiness"" in your head that can never be truly fulfilled. Its just marketing; keeping sex and titillation on your mind makes you a more efficient consumer.

Even something like FHM, which has the ""sexiest women"" bullshit all the time. I mean, what do I get by looking at these women? Nothing. Its not really that sexually stimulating but it is incredibly distracting. It also makes some men really angry at women because they're presented as this sex symbol that they can never touch. So they see women wearing skimpy clothes and think that this is for them, to distract and arouse them; to deny them something or to publicly state that they are in control.

This isn't exclusive to male marketing either. My sister reads a magazine that has some stupid column name like ""Torso of the week"" combined with marketing of products that make you look pretty. Her argument is that this is what women are interested in, but is that really true? Is it not equally possible that people are constantly distracted with titillating images and ideas to the point at which this becomes a near constant obsession or distraction? Your interest is what you constantly think about, are constantly reminded of. 

Pornography, though, is different. It isn't the denial of sex, it is sex. Its showing you something you want. Its still a little frustrating but that frustration can be fulfilled through masturbation, which is basically an assumed part of the medium. If you're reading FHM or looking at a billboard in which a woman is committing herself to a sexy pose all you are is distracted and frustrated, you're probably not in a position in which you can masturbate freely but you are more aware and focused on the advertising material. Job done, as far as the marketing man is concerned, lynx is on your mind, you'll think about that new spot cream when you're in the store, women will buy diet coke even though that gardener/builder with an expensive gym membership will never want  to be their boyfriend. I'm not arguing that this is morally wrong, but it is fucking annoying and there are very few escapes.

The thing is, I don't like a lot of porn, I think much of it is demeaning (to men and women) and gives men the vending machine attitude towards women, that they should be treated with some economic function where you pay out a certain amount of time, friendship, sensitivity and money, and you are rewarded with sex. But it doesn't do this half as much as constant titillation in other socially acceptable mediums like adverts, TV shows, music videos, page 3, magazines or pictures in a leading national news paper. If there is anything the Mail wants, its for you to be frustrated, to feel bottled up, to never get a release, to feel scared and constantly on edge about things you're powerless to change and ignorant of things you can change.

TLDR: Pornography is seen as harmful because it allows the fulfilment of desire, whereas titillation is the creation and denial of your desires, something you keep bottled up and never explicitly engage. I mean, seriously, you can't go 24hrs without being reminded that you're being denied sex, porn is a release. I'm not going to argue that its a fix for anything, I just don't see how its all that harmful.",0,1374575338,null,0,false,0,cb8g0dh,t3_1iszii,t1_cb8g0dh,t1_cb7x03l,null,1430367928,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I just got back from [Hurst View](http://hurstviewleisure.co.uk/) campsite in the New Forest; it was absolutely *fantastic*. 

The site itself has heated showers, full toilet facilities, a shop, washing up area, water supplies etc. - so is very comfortable (not like the old days!). The camping areas are spacious (though a little dull to look at - being big open fields) but nearby there's a 5 minute walk to the beach and a view over the Isle of Wight. I can't promise how absolutely quiet the site will be - but you can find solitude in easy reach around the place. 

The local towns of Lymington / Brockenhurst are no more than 10 minutes drive - as is the forest itself which has fantastic walks throughout and wild horses roaming about the place. 

There's a pub within about 10 / 15 minutes walk from the site that does food as well. All in all I'd highly recommend the area. 

My friends and I did also look at [Three Cliffs]( http://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/wales/the-gower/swansea/239-three-cliffs-bay-caravan-park) in Wales since you mention that area - but they were fully booked when we asked.

I fully believe that organ donation isn't publicised enough, and that there are people who aren't against it that would be happy to donate their organs, but don't because it's an opt-in system and they haven't opted in yet.  

There was a feature on (I think) BBC radio 2 and they had testimonials from relatives who had been asked shortly after the death of their loved one whether they would donate organs. Picture it: your mother has just passed away, and a doctor is asking you if they can take her organs. The relatives said no, but they now regret the decision. It was made at a very emotional time and they would have preferred it to have been taken out of their hands, so to speak, and have the decision made for them.  

People go on and on about the right to choose - an opt-out system does not take that away.

The whole report is interesting, although I've only just skimmed it so far.  One salient point the media declined to make is this one:

&gt;The March deadline data confirms that 18 year old application rates of people from disadvantaged groups in England increased in 2013 to reach their highest recorded values. **This is the case whether disadvantage is defined by area-based measures of higher education entry or by individual-level measures of low income.** (emphasis mine)

So by a measure which does not intentionally use colour, applications are up for students from individually poor families or from geographically under-represented areas.  

Also, the study points out that application levels are at or near all-time highs everywhere.

So the question becomes, if white students (excluding the poorest white students) are not buoyed by this to the same degree, why not, and how can they be encouraged to apply for places that would fit them?

As far as social policies are concerned it should just be 'live and let live' ideally, if it doesn't directly affect you then just leave them alone, and if it does then try to correct it in the least invasive way. (For example internet filters should be opt-in for parents rather than opt-out for everyone)

And as far as economic policy is concerned I just want the economy to serve people rather than the other way around. People should be able to reach their potential or we all lose out. Things like co-operatives are much fairer than the systems we have now - rewarding everyone for hard work. At the moment our economy has a large rentier part with BTL landlords and so on - even Ricardo and Smith hated that idea.

It's not the system that people reward at elections so much as the only system offered at elections and with FPTP it's virtually impossible for new parties to gain ground.

* It will put a **LOT** of people in a very awkward position with their partner/parents when they have to explain why they want it un-blocked. Not everyone is 20 years old with modern ideas about sex, a lot of men in their 40s, 50s and 60s will struggle to explain to their wives that they've been buying/downloading pornography for the last 30 years - remember a lot of older people (especially older women) still consider legal pornography to be a vile moral crime and will misinterpret it as a sign their partner does not love them.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I would say if anything the emblems of the UK are even more predictable - since they already exist, and I don't think there will be much appetite to change them. Even if Scotland leaves the UK, the saltire will continue to represent the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of Scots/those with scottish ancestry in the rest of the UK. i.e. *you can take the union out of Scotland, but you can't take Scotland out of the union*

But above all else, I really don't think 5 million people with a virtually identical culture   seperating is going to radically change the lives or identity of the other 55 million people in the UK. The size, diversity and similar identity of the UK is well setup to take a shock like that, as indeed it did in 1926 and throughout the process of decolonialisation in the 20th century.

If anything, I would say the comparatively smaller Scotland is much more vulnerable to a cultural identity crisis post-independence. The reason for that is because right now the only vision of independence is obviously a pro-independence one. But if Scots really do vote yes in 2014, the post-independence Scotland will not only have to encompass those that supported its seperation, but also the sizable number of Scots who were pro-union. They will no doubt want to retain their British cultural icons and some element of that identity even in a seperate Scotland. i.e. I wouldn't expect to see Britannia statues being pulled down Saddam Hussein style, or portraits of notable non-scottish Brits removed from public places - at least not overnight. That sort of change is something that takes decades and decades of gradual decline as it is slowly replaced with newer more modern identities.

&gt;
Dear Philip Hammond,

&gt;I am a PhD student at [REDACTED] and I am contacting regarding the
recent proposals for an 'opt in' for adult content on the internet.

&gt;Now instead of listing the arguments for why I feel this is a bad idea,
since I feel that is ultimately a dead end, what I will instead suggest
is that I will support the block, if and only if it genuinely does act
to prevent the over-sexualisation of children.

&gt;To this end, I propose that any filter will by default block the Daily
Mail website. An image currently making the rounds on Twitter is a
screenshot of the Daily Mail article regarding the new filters with a
sidebar for their femail column featuring some of the most sexually
depraved articles I have ever seen. I would like to ask how an article
featuring pictures of a topless woman, or pictures of a woman in a
bikini that is as thin as string not considered pornography?  And how
is an article about Kylie Jenner's midriff (who I should note is barely
15) not considered an enabler for child molesters?

&gt;If you want to find who is really shoving sexual content into the faces
of children and who is providing a safe haven for paedophiles, I feel
that you can look no further than the Daily Mail.

&gt;Any adult content filter that does not filter the Daily Mail will be
doing a great injustice to the health and safety of our children, and I
have faith that any new measure will in fact stop children being
subjected to this depraved objectification of women and teenagers as
sex objects.  I also have faith that there will promptly be an
investigation on Bianca Carneiro for her articles sexualising young
adults, enabling paedophiles.

&gt;Yours sincerely,

&gt;[REDACTED]",0,1374579274,null,0,false,0,cb8gknz,t3_1isxyr,t1_cb8gknz,t3_1isxyr,null,1430367662,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Obviously child abuse is a real thing, but I think most of these books are simply made up, and read by people that weren't abused as a way to get their kicks.

I moved from East Sussex 4 years ago to Southwestern Ontario and I would recommend to stay in Canada for now. The UK is going through some tough times.

It's not a perfect solution, obviously, but it's a start, and I think the same applies for Child Pornography.

Consequently, it's why I disagree with OP's quite strident blanket statement about 'why all censorship is bad bad bad period no excuses': I'm a fan of accessibility of information, I'm a firm believer in the idea that the gaining of knowledge is vital for human development, but with that I'm also a firm believer in the fact that you can't take an all-or-nothing approach to things. Honestly, I don't deny that censorship of the internet is in many cases being used as a cover to implement some completely unjustified and utterly ludicrous restrictions on what are fundamentally harmless areas of media, but again I don't deny that there are real problems to which content control/censorship present a viable solution to some parts at the very least.

&gt; One thing you can't do to an adult under any circumstances is lawfully use violence against them if you aren't defending yourself

Wrong. The police can use violence against you legally even if they or others are not in danger. Anyone who has been the wrong end of a baton or a mounted charge, or a plastic bullet, or even  a hefty push for walking too slowly will be able to confirm that.


Refusing to accept arrest and reasonable violence can be used against you.  Failure to follow reasonable instructions given by a police officer or prison warden can result in legal violence against you.


So basically, you're wrong.  

Look I'm not in favour of smacking kids, but ""you aren't allowed to hurt an adult"" doesn't hold water if you want to bring the justice system into play.

All cryptographic algorithms work like this. For a crypto algorithm to not be immediately vulnerable to cryptanalysis its ciphertext (output) must appear to be random - no underlying pattern. If there is an underlying pattern, inferences can be drawn by a cryptanalyst and parts of the algorithm or key deduced.

However, all these volumes generally don't just contain the ciphertext - they also contain a header block with information about the algorithm used, and the size of the ciphertext (for example).

I can see a Modric comparison, but he's not like Coutinho.

We've also got Lucas for that. Would you say Arteta is an Essien/Masch type of player? No, but he does the job perfectly because it's possible in a 2-man midfield.

&gt;they are similar in their style of play, they are the assist machines that will chip in with goals.

Sorry, this is completely wrong. 5 goals and 6 assists in his WHOLE career for Allen. Xavi is an exception because of the team he plays in and he's one of the best midfielders in the world, but in his early career his stats were similar. They're 'deep lying' players, yes you expect them to chip in with assists, but their focus is quick passing and distribution, as you said.

Joe Allen is a young player, give him a season in the role and he could excel in it. When we signed Lucas he was an attacking mid.

true,aidrocsid,null,null,"Well, a few years ago I saw some episodes of *something* that I thought were amazing. It may have been Father Ted, I don't quite remember. I got to talking to some internet friends (one Belgian, one British) about it and they started recommending things. Of course, this was years after I'd seen The Young Ones and Black Books, and probably a decade after I'd seen Monty Python, but I hadn't had the ease of access that modern file sharing provides. Once I had people feeding me a huge list of great things to watch and easy, immediate access, I was hooked. 
  
I'm not really *quite* sure what it is I like about British TV specifically. There does seem to be a higher average production value, and I *love* the personalities that you see in different places. People like Stephen Fry, David Mitchell, Bill Bailey, Jimmy Carr, basically everyone who shows up on panel quiz shows. QI in particular is a great example of everything that's right with British television. It lacks that condescension that's visible in so much American television, it respects the intellect of the viewer. I'd imagine it's got something to do with being produced in the interest of the public good rather than to turn as big a profit as possible. Quality for the sake of quality *exists* in the US, but in smaller pockets, usually produced by the same few big players. Things *do* seem to be changing a bit; this is simultaneously the golden age of television in the US and the time when the largest quantity of unadulterated garbage is being broadcast. With things like Sherlock and Downton Abbey coming out of the UK, that's just icing on the cake.

true,QWOP_Sparkle,durham,Durham,"I'm going to sound like satan here, but hear me out. I disagree with any charity case that asks for money to help other people, because I don't see where my money is actually going.

&gt; **Shoebox Donations**
I have always been taught to give objects as opposed to money. For example, every year I create 2 shoebox presents for [Operation Christmas Child](http://www.operationchristmaschild.org.uk/landing.asp). Charity cases go insane on advertisements at that time of year, this kid needs £2 a month or else something bad will happen and you will ruin his christmas...or something along those lines. Why are things like ShoeBox Christmas Presents not advertised?

&gt; **Soup Kitchen Volunteer**
I briefly volunteered at a local soup kitchen (varies from town to town where they're located) during my college years, sometimes homeless/poor people don't want money thrown at them, sometimes they just want someone to talk to and see a friendly smile after being ignored for days on end.

&gt; **Volunteer for Disabled children charity**
There are different names in different towns, a quick google search can help you find a local charity!
There are numerous places across the country that ask for volunteer work every summer. All you need is a CRB check ready to hand in and you could make a difference to a child's life throughout the summer. Unless you yourself have a child with a physical/mental disability, it's hard to imagine what parents must go through during the children's school holidays. The last time I volunteered one parent mentioned how grateful she was that these types of places exist. You take these kids to the beach, fun fairs, playgroups, paint etc. It's extremely tiring (the last child I mentored wanted to play tag...all day...this was a 10-3 shift, I didn't need to go to the gym after work!) but it's completely worth it. It also looks real good on a CV!


&gt; **Buy farm animals/tools for Africa**
This is a great site, literally called [FARM](http://www.farmafricapresents.org.uk/buy) and, although it's a charity type site, it's all controlled by you. You can help a family with anything, you can buy them chickens, beehives and even water pumps. You have complete control over your money and where it's going.

&gt; **Mental Health Volunteers**
Have or know someone with a Mental Health disorder? There are usually local places that allow people to volunteer/work who struggle to find work because of their condition. [MIND](http://www.mind.org.uk) is a great charity, started by Stephen Fry, full of professional workers who can help anyone who feels like they're hindered.

I went to my local MIND for a friend and they gave me information and contacts of places in the town where my friend can work, as she suffers with BPD, Depression and Anxiety. She was able to find volunteer work easily, to help her feel more confident at working in a public area and she was then able to find a job which could accommodate to her personal needs.



There are loads more places and ways that you can help people that don't guilt trip or require you to pay *just £2 a month*.

The remaining 40 will never buy the music, but they also won't pirate it until pirating reaches a certain threshold where it is very easy. The internet is that threshold. Those 40 people are now pirating the music, yes. But they would never have bought it in the first place so you haven't lost a sale. 

(edit: the key to turning those pirates into customers is providing a better service than piracy can, that's why iTunes works. It's a simple, easy to use service so people don't mind paying. Those 10 people who will pirate no matter what aren't going to be affected though. You can draw a comparison between this and the DRM measures that were put in place on Assassin's Creed 2 at launch. When the pirated copies don't include the DRM, why buy the real copy? The pirated one gives a better service.)

In reality I realise it is more complex than this.

Then a few years later at about 17 I was looking for a saturday job so applied to loads of places, including one of the stores I had written to (I'd forgotten all about the traidcraft thing by now).

Because you've never gone hunting? I don't know, seems kind of personal.

&gt;How come agression at gun point seems so banal in the USA while it's (except hold-ups) inexistant in my country ?

As an American, I find it quite scary, actually. The definition of a hold-up is aggression at gunpoint, so I don't know what you're getting at there. If you're referring to the murder rate, I'd hypothesize the ethnic and religious diversity of the US has something to do with it. People fight over differences. Take guns away and it'll still happen.

&gt;Do you think that the fact that so many of your minor thugs are packing heat is somewhat linked to with how many legal guns are infesting the country?

I think your theory is plausible but happens far less often than you make it seem.

&gt;We have no guns here, so the predator doesn't need to have one, he won't have to nervously point a gun at us fearing that we may be packing and shooting our faces because, a squeeze is so easily triggered.

So what does ""the predator"" use? A knife? Aren't those hard to kill with or something? Point is, there will be crime no matter what. The other guy will probably have some sort of firearm. The question is how well you want to prepare yourself for their aggression. I don't think a common criminal who has possession of a legally obtained gun is going to go out of their way to get, say, an MP5 off of the black market once everyone else has guns...that is, if they survive their next burglary.

4. and the total reduction in Sure Start funding.

Being based in the US, they can be issued with an order that makes them legally comply to keep logs, hand these over, while not being able to say a word. A court order is not even needed in the most extreme of situations (FISA for example)

Not complying would be grounds for instant arrest. Talking about the court order would be grounds for instant arrest. Both would have serious repercussions for anyone involved at the company in not complying.

It's all well and good harping the ""we would close the company before exposing our customers"" line, but that normally doesn't last long when armed men raid you house at 4am while you're in bed with your family.

This isn't some paranoid, unlikely situation either. This stuff is happening **now**. The fact that they have instructions on how to issue them with DMCA requests for take downs means they *must* log something, or they couldn't comply as required under US law.

A couple of things you might want to consider.
1) The UK has some of the tightest gun control in the world, that is a fact and the complete banning of handguns is quite rare globally.

2) Gun ownership is largely make up of barrel loading shotguns and long rifles, used by farmers and sportsmen, this is a far cry from the US, where semi auto handguns and revolvers rule the market. There are lightyears between these types of guns.

3) The UK has no laws allowing for legal carry, this is probably the biggest thing people mean by 'no guns', every state in the USA allows for concealed carry, and some open carry, when you're walking around places like Arizona, you can be pretty sure a lot of the people you're standing next to are packing.

3) Every gun in the UK *has* to be registered, this isn't the case in a lot of other countries (USA included), its really impossible to accurately say how many guns there are in most places, it would be like trying to work out how many bicycles there are in a country (do you include that old one at the back of the shed you've forgotten about...).

4) Most of Africa is below us, I can tell you now that Sierra Leone does not have .6 guns per 100 people, they just do not track them at all, they recently removed all tracking and registering of firearms, because no one was doing it anyway. The .6 probably comes from police or military weapons..

- The official figure excludes a number of costs, including round-the-clock security, lavish royal visits and lost revenue from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.

3. annual Ministry of Defence spending on food 
4. and the total reduction in Sure Start funding.

* I think a lot of Americans in particular struggle with the idea as they see monarchy as something that is outdated - indeed you said:

&gt; Monarchy as a system of government has pretty much been consigned to history's dustbin of bad ideas

I want to try and convince you that certainly isn't the case. Indeed you'll see about 25% of nations still have monarchs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_sovereign_monarchs

* Americans tend to be taught about the issues that come about when you have unelected leaders... only circa 1770. **But** whilst monarchs might seem traditional, that is not say they have not modernised. In the 1770s doctors cured people by attaching leaches to their bodies... that is not to say they do it today. The Royal Family in the UK are actually very modern, the Queen was a member of the womens branch of the army during the second world war where she learnt to drive -- very modern for a young woman at that point. More recently she was one of the first people to send an email or have a mobile phone. Don't be fooled by the traditional grandmother image, modernisation means survival for the Royal Family and they are quick to embrace new ideas - with recent examples like their website and youtube channel.

* The idea of the modern monarch is that you take one group of people - give them the overarching **right** to govern, and give them enough wealth that they are not motivated by the aquisition of money... However, unlike in the 1500s you prevent them from going power-mad by removing their ability to actually make political decisions.... The way that works in the UK is that the queen *'allows'* parliament to act on her behalf. Her job is to open and close that parliament and give assent the laws it passes. Obviously though if she doesn't do that, they will use their influence to oust her. Its a balancing act - she controls parliament, and parliament control her. You only have to look as far back as President Bush to see a great example of what can happen when one person has a tiny bit too much power.

* Her constitutional role aside, by far her main job is actually to promote the British people and their culture - any by extension those of the commonwealth. That includes the ceremonial stuff you mentioned, but that is a tiny part of it. She also gives her authority to institutions (like the Royal Colleges), to individuals (through Knighthoods and other awards), helps diplomatically and uses her knowledge and influence to further British culture abroad and at home.

* In the last regard, I think having a Royal Family as a leader of state is actually far superior to the US system of a 2-term maximum president. Remember, Queen Elizabeth II has met every prime minister and virtually every world leader going all the way back to Winston Churchill in 1947. She understands a great deal about politicians I daresay. But it also means she doesn't have to deal with maintaining popular political policies, and isn't as vulnerable to lobbying since her role is constitutional not legislative.

* Finally, I would make the case that human society is intrinsically unfair. The rich and powerful inevitably seek to maintain their wealth and power while the poor try to penetrate their ranks... if you think having a royal family is more exclusive than your own system in the US I would point out that you've had a film star (Reagan) a man and and his son (Bush and Bush) and one of the richest most influential families in the US (Kennedy) in charge before a black man or a woman. The US, like the UK and virtually every nation on the planet is ruled by a relatively small political elite. What makes both the US and the UK democracies is that **anybody** can join that political elite through election. I will conceede that while theoretically anyone can be president, not everyone can be the monarch - but the monarch is not the same as your president... if anything the prime minister peforms virtually every function the president does except the constitutional head of state role - which in the UK we have spun out into two entities: the Monarch on one hand and the Prime minister on the other - both working together, to constrain the extent of the others control.

* Finally, to flip this on its head - to us in the UK we find it very strange that in the US you would have a President who is a head of state, the commander in chief and the prime legislator. To us that is far too much power for one individual person to hold.

I hope this goes some way to answering your question. The true answer is that there probably isn't an ideal 'fair' way of governing, and this way works for us just like your way works for you. But don't be under the mistaken impression republics are somehow morally superior to monarchies. Tyrannical republics are bad, just like tyrannical monarchs are bad.

Such use was given parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that ""the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag"".

BBCA is also the sole producer of the specials, “The Best of” shows (The Doctor, The Monsters, Companions), and the Doctors Revisited documentaries.

**The examiner is just a person**

People get so nervous about the test that they imagine the examiner to be this terrifying machine who is there to fail you. That's simply not the case, remember that he (or she) is just a person doing a job. They go home to a wife and kids at the end of the day. When you meet them before hand, be polite. Talk to them. Ask how they're doing. Just try not to come off as a cocky arsehole. They'll warm to you and the mood in the car will become much less of an issue, and will help your nerves.

Remember, if the examiner starts a conversation, it's because he/she doesn't want to spend their day being driven around the same route all day in complete silence whilst they tick boxes. If you're nice to them, they'll be nicer to you. 

**Don't rush**

I'll give you an example: My partner had her first test and the examiner asked her to pull over at the side of the road. She panicked, and jumped straight over to the side. She rushed, and forgot to check it was safe to do so. 

Take a deep breath, and make sure it's safe to do so. Similarly, if you missed something that the examiner said, you're allowed to double check. In the case of Independent Driving, you're not penalised at all for asking him/her to repeat directions. ""Was it left at these lights?"" will NOT hurt your test.

Good luck!",0,1374591431,null,0,false,0,cb8jm8l,t3_1iutsq,t1_cb8jm8l,t3_1iutsq,null,1430366228,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

That is completely fair and something I simply forgot about.


Though I still must disagree, I appreciate we are talking about 10's of millions of £'s, which is an unheard of amount to anyone such as ourselves, I also appreciate £4m as a percentage is really quite small and only seems so large to people like ourselves.

But that cannot be ignored, £4m is a lot of money, would you rather we sold Scott Parker for £4m or got nothing for him?

Don't get me wrong on so many levels I agree with you, but I have to stand up for Levy, because he deserves credit for the fact if we 'fell apart' now, we'd still be a mid table team with still either an extremely good squad with about £100m to spend (minus Bale), or even a mid table squad with about £170m to spend.

I think independence will create far more political tensions that those that exist now. It will create divides where none currently exist.

For example, when passing legislation that benefits London, Westminster has to consider how it will affect other regional conurbations like Cardiff, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool etc. Under independence the UK doesn't have to do anything to accomodate cities in Scotland... So for example, you might find things like rail and shipping connections that compete with UK cities are deprioritised. Similarly industries like the Royal Navies shipbuilding projects are likely to move away from yards like Rosyth and Govan, costing jobs in Scotland - as there is a legal duty to build warships in UK shipyards. You will almost certainly find the UK adjusts its timezone to BST+1 to better reflect the daylight hours in England and Ireland, in a move that could harm the Scottish economy.

Those are just a few examples of the false economy of Scottish independence - whereby after becoming independant the Scots actually end up having less influence over their own lives in several important areas. Personally if I were in Scotland I'd push for devo-max, it is the best combination of having a vested interest in the UK (and vice versa) whilst having maximum political control over domestic affairs with the minimum uncertainty and disruption.

&gt; the Scandinavian countries are still Nordic despite no longer being in a union

This is one of my bug bears with the independence debates... Scandinavia and the Nordic region have **never** *really* been in any form of Union like the UK, ever in its history. What they did have is a sort of Schengen precursor to passport union around the 1950s. Further back, in the 1400s they had something called the Kalmar Union but it was undermined from day 1 by diverging interests.

Having been to Sweden and Denmark I can tell you first hand that the animosity they have for each other makes the differences between the UK and Scotland look trivial at times. Far from being some kind of utopia they are as distinct and unique as any other set of nations, with as much political fighting between them as anywhere else. Along those lines, the whole *""Scotland is more Nordic in outlook""* argument is a romantic concept that has no basis in reality - indeed the Nordic outlook itself ranges from people like Anders Breivik all the way to pro-russian communists with everything in between.

As for who backs up Kompany... it's tricky.  I don't think we can sell Garcia at anything other than a huge loss after the season he had so maybe it's wise to have him plug any gaps, but is he good enough?  If we bring in an actual defender I worry that it means Barry will get shunted out because he was good enough to attract a reasonable fee.

I don't think Boyata is or will be good enough.  Rekik may be, but as you say, he's out on loan.  Beyond those lads there are no EDS names leaping out at me.

Kompany's bonce to win the league again!

As for the past.  Tommy Booth is the player we chose for our all-time XI - like many others he was around in City's heyday, but was marginally before my time.  As a youngish lad I quite liked Colin Hendry but he wasn't around for very long.  

I think recently you should have a look for Andy Morrison's debut.  I hate that I don't think of him as one of the City greats, but at that time he was exactly what was needed and made a huge impact.  Also have a look for Richard Dunne - I've no specific highlight in mind because he was so good for so long (won player of the year 4 years on the bounce if I remember correctly), despite all the red cards and own goals.

As you suggest, I think barring some dramatic twist, Kompany seems to be on the cards as a future all-time City legend (if he isn't already).  I could potentially see him returning to Anderlecht for a season or two in his twilight years, but I don't think anyone would begrudge him that.

It will also shorten journey times between most of the major cities in the midlands and northern England with the travel hubs in the southeast... i would say that if there is one group of people it doesn't directly benefit its those in London, who are already served by effective transport links to the global hubs at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Channel Tunnel and are a fairly short distance from the ferry ports at Dover and Southampton. They are also located in one of the most 'employable' parts of the country so have little onus to build rail connections elsewhere. If you want an example of an expensive rail project that benefits London then think of Crossrail not HS2.

Connecting competitor cities like Birmingham might if anything harm London as it could drive buisnesses over in that direction where operating costs are much cheaper.

My gripe with HS2 is that I think they should have focused less on the passenger elements and more on the freight components. They put too much emphasis on where current rail traffic is rather than where it might be in 10-20 years. If we are going to experience a manufacturing recovery then we'll need good freight connections with the ports and airports to back it up.

Position in this league is defined by wins/draws/losses against other people in the league during the course of the season.

More than that, actually advertising that it would be shown to everybody after and deleting that after it was shown. 

We have a damp little island, we've managed to create a wonderful show that has outlasted anything you've managed to conjure up and when it's reaching the celebration of that the showrunner has decided to go and give you the first look at the big celebration.

Countries with opt-out organ donations are around 98-99% of people donating, but it is only around 4% to 17% for those with opt-in systems. It's a truly staggering difference in the level of participation.

He explains the huge discrepancy thus:
&gt; You might think that people do this because they don’t care. That the decision about donating their organs is so trivial that they can’t be bothered to lift up the pencil and check the box. But in fact the opposite is true. This is a hard emotional decision about what will happen to our bodies after we die and what effect it will have on our those close to us. It is because of the difficulty and the emotionality of these decisions that they just don’t know what to do so they adopt the default option

He goes on to explain the importance of the default option in all kinds of unexpected different situations. 

And too address your main point, an opt-in system doesn't get away from the government deciding.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"It's a rare opinion, there is almost total support for the monarchy in the UK and the republican movement is very small. Source: Huge support the Queen had during her Diamond Jubilee last year -- http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/jubilee060512/j36_45757517.jpg

As I explained above, the Queens primary purpose is not to be a monarch in the traditional sense of ruling the nation... infact her main role is actually to promote British culture and values, and she does that job incredibly well in most peoples eyes... Consider that for a tiny nation of 60 million people virtually every man, woman and child on this planet knows who our Queen is, they could point out our country on a map and maybe even tell you a bit about our history and cultural values. Monarchy is all part of that process - its something identifiable about the UK that doesn't change. Computers may get faster, cars may get more environmentally friendly and politics may change -- but the Queen stays the same, a figurehead for British society.

Add to that the fact that virtually every member in the direct line of the Royal family has served in the Army, Royal Navy or Royal Air Force -- including the Queen herself. And they aren't just ceremonial roles - Prince Harry (the queens Grandson and 4th in line) is an Apache helicopter gunner in the Army. Her other grandson Prince William is an RAF search and rescue pilot. Her son (next in line) Prince Charles was a minesweeper captain in the Royal navy, and her other son prince Andrew was a helicopter pilot who was decorated for helping to save the crew off the burning wreck of HMS Sir Galahad in the 1982 Falklands war. Most members of the royal family are also 'colonels in chief' (ceremonial heads) of army units - and as a consequence the Army in particular is fiercly loyal to the monarchy.

They have a privaledged life no doubt, but they are also an accomplished family. They've dedicated themselves to our country and to our culture and most people in the UK cannot fault them for that. There certainly are controversies from time to time, and Prince Charles is notably less popular (though none the less still popular) than his mother... but on the whole they are supported by most people... otherwise we'd get rid of them.",0,1374599057,null,0,false,0,cb8mm01,t3_1iuoow,t1_cb8mm01,t1_cb8955m,null,1430364818,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"No, not at all. Hydrocarbon usage is on the increase, and bioplastics are still at a relatively early stage of development, as are electric cars and a host of other things we use hydrocarbons for.

It's worth pointing out that essentially all oilfields have been using water and other drilling fluids for the last few decades. This is not new. There are drilling fluids guys out there who're reaching retirement at this point - it's been going on for ages. Your average person on the street thinks it's new because they have no idea about the oil industry, but it's not. Secondly, this idea of contamination is also kind of silly, again partially because we've already been using essentially these methods for a great deal of time (just not for shale, but rather for conventional oil deposits) and also because the shale is waaaaaaaaaaay below the water table geologically. If contamination were to occur when we frack the shale deposits then it'd have occurred many many moons ago naturally anyway.

Honestly, I don't mean to be rude, but you're clearly not up to scratch on your O&amp;G knowledge enough to be talking about this.

Having said that, I think we'll line up like this:

                              Cech

         Azpilicueta     Ivan       Luiz       Cole

                           Lukaku

I think the hardest part is predicting the deeper midfielders considering we have so many. I went with a 4-3-3 because I believe that it is neither too attacking nor too defensive. We have 2 box-to-box mids in Ramires and Lamps plus an anchor in Mikel, all 3 of whom played in the pivot last season so their aware of their defensive duties. MvG will most likely be rotated with Lamps and Essien with Mikel, I expect Ramires to be rotated the least. The biggest problem I see with this is the rotation of the attacking players because we have 6 players for the 2 wing positions, so it's a good thing I'm not manager. All in all, we have a nice complete squad that doesn't exactly need shoring up in any position, unless you're of the opinion that we need another striker.",0,1374600494,null,0,false,0,cb8n76r,t3_1iw7ff,t1_cb8n76r,t3_1iw7ff,null,1430364540,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

The reason is that when you label people who have been abused as ""victims"", it makes them *feel* like victims. 

The author of TFA is not a survivor of porn, or a survivor of breakfast, instead she is a survivor of sexual abuse. 

Being raped is not something that people feel lightly about - they don't dismiss it so easily as a poorly-cooked fry-up (to continue your analogy). 

So this is something that the author is likely to talk about throughout her life - she explained in FTA how the taboo nature of sex in previous decades made it impossible to confide in anyone who could have helped her, so she'll probably want to tell her teenaged daughter, ""hey, this happened to me, so if any guy treats you badly, you can tell me about it"". 

AIUI using terms like ""rape victim"" makes people feel like it's a shameful admission every time they say it - as they might do when befriending a new confidant or dating a new partner.  

Allowing people to embrace terms like ""rape survivor"" allows them to feel like this is something that happened to them, but it no longer *defines* them.

The word *survivor* allows the conversation to be framed in terms of ""I was in a bad place for a while, but I'm better now"". ",0,1374600654,null,0,false,0,cb8n9lf,t3_1iv7pa,t1_cb8n9lf,t1_cb8f2rh,null,1430364510,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

2 - It is most certainly NOT random, because a random file contains zero redundant information, and hence cannot be compressed.

Look at how he's framing his argument at the moment: a bunch of other countries did it and therefore we can expect it will happen here. Once it starts with child porn, it will also progress to other things. He's creating this scary vision that inevitably we're going to start censoring everything we just don't like. And that's just a distraction from the real issue, which is whether we actually should block child porn. Or whether we should give copyright holders the power to block sites that infringe on their copyrights. And whether this can be done reliably without restricting people's ability to say what they want. And so on. 

So, no, I don't think he's adequately responded to the objections to his argument.

British shows tackle some serious storylines which could never be done here, Skins for example (yes I know about the US version, garbage compared to y'all's.)

Secondly, no ads. Can't tell you how big of an annoyance this becomes on American TV after you've seen the BBC...even for sports, I wish basketball and our football didn't have so many damn breaks in play like in your football. 

Third, the quality of the programming is usually superior to most American TV. Best example I have: Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares has been remade here as simply Kitchen Nightmares and they made a few changes to Americanize it which made the show exponentially worse (still awesome though) such as shortening the run time (ads again,) bleeping out the constant cursing of course, and I don't even have a much of a problem with that but again, takes away from the realism. Worst of all they also added a voice-over which treats the audience like dumbasses, walking you through exactly what's happening on screen in front of our eyes. It's infuriating. 

Next, BBC News is far far better than anything we have, and a lot more impartial than any of our major stations: CNN, MSNBC, and of course FOX (although PBS is up there.)  


And most importantly of all: you have Top Gear! The greatest thing ever put on screen! Don't even get me started on American Top Gear.
