RTD episodesa(Seasons 1-4) are usually more suited to people who already like sci-fi. Moffatt's(Season 5 to current) are a bit more fantasy like in tone and has less camp in the production values therefore more accessible to more people providing you pick a good episode.  A Christmas Carol features Michael Gambon who's a great actor and is recognizable to people who liked the Harry Potter movies. The episode also still provides an emotional story while still showcasing it's unique style of sci-fi and making time for the comedy.

The only thing is it may be difficult to go back to the previous Doctors as it's a completely different style and show runner and they're really worth it.  It also may be hard for you to adjust to new Doctors whatever order you go in.

If you watch a couple episodes and like it, it's worth it to start from the beginning of the reboot with Rose once you already like it. Eccleston is great but the show definitely had a weak start when compared to the rest.

true,tcain5188,newcr-1,,"I don't know if you guys have noticed, but since Pienaar's been out, Baines has been hardly more than mediocre. Obviously he is still a fantastic set piece taker, but other than that, he hasn't been the stand-out performer that we know he can be in regular play. I think that's largely due to the absence of Pienaar. No other player who gets on that left wing connects with Baines the way Pienaar does, and the threat from that side has dropped significantly. In saying all this, I think Rob has probably noticed as well, and Pienaar will easily take his starting spot back at LW/LM. Deulofeu will still be a very healthy sub, but Mirallas is more experienced and a better starter for sure on the RW. So, in summary:

------------Lukaku-----------

Pienaar---Barkley---Mirallas

McCarthy/Osman/Barry/Gibson  (any two of the four there)

Baines-Distin-Jags-Coleman

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"Found this that certainly explains Inflation in a sensible way. 

&gt;Inflation isn't something we directly choose to have. As long as prices are set by market forces, there will always be price fluctuations and the upwards movements in prices are inflation.

&gt;The market price for any good is supposed the be the price where the quantity produced by the producers equals the quantity consumers wnat to buy at that price. As long as neither side of this equation changes, the price will not change.

&gt;However, in real life there always are changes. May be some of us get raises and thus want to consume more, this causes the quantity people want to buy at any price to increase. At the original price demand exceeds supply. So price rises. ANother cause of price increase would be if the price of raw materials used in production increases; it costs more, so the producer will want ask for a higher price.

&gt;Now, expand this idea from a single product to all products.

&gt;When we are told inflation is 2%, this means that the cost of a particular basket of goods has gone up by 2%. This basket of goods is supposed to be the average basket of what people consume. So, some goods prices might rise, others fall.

&gt;There are issues with the basket, what goods are chosen, how often does the basket change... As someone mentioned prices of basic foodstuff went up by 10%, this means that, either the weight of foodstuff in the basket is low, or prices of other stuff fell a lot to compensate.

&gt;Once the level of inflation is calculated, one can argue that it represents a loss to workers. Inflation is 2%, so I need 2% extra wages to compensate me for the increase in prices so I can buy exactly the same goods today as I did last year.

&gt;But since wages are part of the cost of production...

&gt;It's a cycle.

&gt;But it doesn't mean inflation is bad. Mild inflation (like 2%) simply means that the economy is doing well, people have jobs (if they didn't, to increase production, there wouldn't be a need to increase wages, unemployed people would be willing to work without pay rise).",0,1381562705,null,0,false,0,ccq4oto,t3_1o7r8s,t1_ccq4oto,t1_ccpyznn,null,1429158252,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Higher taxes were simply a function of the significantly higher net profits achieved in the 1990s, but greatly increased cash demands from the Treasury ('negative External Financing Limits') represented a government decision to take advantage of the Post Office's heightened earning power. Over this entire period, the Government was paid £2.4bn in negative EFLs, effectively a proxy for dividend payments, in addition to £1.4bn in corporation tax. The EFL regime was dropped after 1999 with the Post Office’s transition to plc status.

[Lower Socio-Economic Status Modifies Heritability of IQ in Young Children](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/14/6/623.short)

Basically, if you are from a lower SES background, the extent to which IQ is heritable from your parents is much lower since the children have so many other limiting factors on their ability. However, in higher SES backgrounds, the children don't have the dampening effects of their environment so genetic differences play a far greater role. These results, as with most research into the heritability of IQ, were done using twin studies. 

Thus it would suggest that teaching is MORE important in low income areas than in high ones, were genetics are the most significant factor. ",0,1381569318,null,0,false,0,ccq5ie8,t3_1o90eg,t1_ccq5ie8,t3_1o90eg,null,1429157869,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He can be great and the banter we can have is unmatcheable, the only reason why I am still considering staying his friend... but he can have an 'edgy' humour that I think at times borders on the actually racist.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","An MP makes £66,396 per year.

Which is a good salary for someone under the age of 30. But they can't claim expenses per your demands, so let's see how far that goes, shall we?


£66,396/12 is £5,533 per month.

Less pension deductions - the lowest rate is 7.75%, or £428.81. Once you've accounted for that and for the personal allowance, there's  a taxable income of £4,317.53.

Tax and NI is £1,193.51 and £378.53

We shall assume our prospective MP has a student loan, repayments on which would be £375.23.

Giving a net salary of £3,156.92 coming into your bank account every month.

Okay, our MP is going to need accommodation within a reasonable travelling distance of the Houses of Parliament. We'll try and keep it reasonably close by because MPs are quite often working very late in their offices; it's simply not reasonable to ask someone to put up with a long commute back to the crash pad if they finally leave at 9 o'clock at night.

Rightmove has a lot of flats within 5 miles of SW1A 0AA - but if you want a 1 bedroom flat to yourself that isn't a complete dive, you won't see any change out of £1,000-1200 per month.

This leaves our prospective MP with £1956.92.

We'll assume they come from somewhere with high youth unemployment - seems reasonable, seeing as that's the sort of issue you're standing on. There's a few areas in the country that qualify for this (see: http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2011/nov/16/youth-unemployment-map), but most of them are a significant distance from London. If our MP is to spend any significant amount of time with his constituents, he will also need to rent somewhere there.

For argument's sake, we'll put our MP in Doncaster and assume s/he has a longterm partner but no kids, and so only really needs a 1 or 2 bed flat. 

We'll use Doncaster for argument's sake. You can find a 2 bed property to rent in Doncaster for around £400/month quite easily, leaving our MP with £1556.92.

A train from Doncaster to Westminster costs around £120-160 return. Let's assume our MP divides his time so as to ensure he spends one day a week in Doncaster and four in London, hence making the trip 4 times per month. He spends about £5-600 per month on train fares, giving him about £1,000 left.

He's not allowed to accept donations but he'll still have to canvass like buggery to get himself elected. And he's independent, so he'll have to finance that himself - there's no party to do it for him. Sending a single letter once to 25,000 addresses would cost around £13,000. Which means our prospective MP (assuming he started with more-or-less nothing) has to pay off a £13,000 overdraft with that £1,000/month he has left.

Psst, no it doesn't. Both give us 70 points. You should go to bed earlier :-p

Haha, in all seriousness though, without getting into the whole ""oh we should beat this team and this team"" discussion, as long as we are consistent throughout the season and keep up our form then it should be enough.

If we break the season into blocks of 5 matches, for example, it would mean winning 3 and drawing 1 of each block of 5. If we take our first 5 matches against Stoke, Villa, United, Swansea and Southampton, that's exactly what happened. We picked up 10 points from 15 and found ourselves in the top 2. Since then we've started our next ""block"" of games with 2 wins, with Newcastle away, WBA at home and Arsenal away coming up.

Obviously it would help if we beat Arsenal, as that would be 3 points we deny them, but I'm a firm believer that if we take care of our own results without worrying about how our rivals are doing we could still find our way to the top end of the table.

Our next block is against Fulham (H), Everton (A), Hull (A), Norwich (H), West Ham (H). In theory, all winnable games and if we do particularly well in these, it could give us some breathing room when it comes to our next block (against the likes of Spurs, City, Chelsea).

I don't know if I'm the only one who likes to break the season down like this, but after all, it's a numbers game. If we average 1.9 ppg, it'll give us 72 points.

When a self-employed plumber buys a new set of tools, he is able to offset the cost of those tools against his annual tax liability, this is tax avoidance. It is also perfectly reasonable. This is the kind of thing that accounts for most of the so-called 'lost tax revenue' that people are becoming indiscriminately furious about.

If you've ever taken a pad, pen or pack of Post-It notes from your employer for your personal use, just bear in mind that your employer offsets the cost of that stationary against their tax liability, this too is a perfectly legitimate act of tax avoidance. Will you reimburse Revenue and Customs with the tax they've lost on that stolen stationary?

I'll also point out to you that, if you are currently a paid employee of a business, the salary you're paid is also offset against your company's tax liability. This too is tax avoidance.

Why is 5% so much better than 9%?  Our goal isn't 0% unemployment, and anybody who tells you it is is an idiot.  Sweden has an unemployment rate that is very close to ours, and  their's hasn't changed during the crisis, by and large.

Again, I'm not arguing austerity ""worked"" - whatever the hell that means"" - but focusing on our unemployment rate as if it's somehow an obvious sign of failure is, well, wrong.  It doesn't tell you anything useful.

Most of continental Europe has always been satisfied with an unemployment rate around 9-10%, even at the height of the boom period.  We aimed for around 5%.  It's an entirely arbitrary aim, and doesn't tell you anything about the economy as a whole. 

Look at satisfaction, quality of life, work-life balance, education - those are important indicators.  And yes, some seem to show we're still in a lot of trouble.

Did we now? Care to show us where you found this information? Or is it your own assumption based on your personal racial prejudices?

I seem to remember the medieval ages were a time where kings ruled over peasants, we burned witches and went to war over baseless religions,  scientific research was hardly a strong point.

Me typing this is probably a waste of time, you are a racist and there is probably very little I can do to have a reasonable discussion with someone who has such a close minded and irrational view of the world. Maybe one race does have certain aspects that differ to other races, but calling human beings ""niggers"" in a serious tone like you just have shows that you don't care about facts, you just don't like people with a different skin tone.

I decided to have a nosy inside, see how things transpired. I went in at ~12:15, the only entrance was through the ramp down the side of the Interchange (the footway, not the road). At the bottom they had a couple of airport-metal-detector-style gates, although I think they were just plastic things to control inflow. They did a proper patdown search and such before letting you in.

When I got in they were basically all at The Queen having a few drinks. The first two photos I took were from that time, but then a couple of coppers made me leave ^(which I did peacefully). Not sure why, but they're obviously pretty paranoid.

Walking round, it was obvious they've put a lot of effort in to contain them in that square - lots of police vans blocking the roads at each side.

I read the document the police were handing out on your way in (it's the fifth in the album) and found out the, er, festivities were to begin at 1:30, so I went back in and they had a few speeches and such, half of which was ""we're being opressed by the muslims"", the other half of which didn't even make logical sense. But there you go.

Stuck around till about 2:15, then buggered off home. It seemed peaceful enough, and the speakers were actively encouraging people to not cause trouble. I'm interested to see how it goes down, but to be honest I reckon it'll all be a big non-event in the end.

**TL;DR** the police had it under control, and the protesters weren't exactly making great points but were pretty harmless. I particularly enjoy the ""Who's streets?"" ^(rather than ""whose"") in the 3rd picture :)

Why would US companies accept it with no problem, but British suppliers , who you would expect to explicitly support it decline it?

Because, like all of these specific subtypes of Visa, if it isn't explicitly supported by a card provider, it falls back onto using the standard Visa network. If a payment gateway doesn't know what Electron is, it just uses Visa.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Striking duos simply don't work the way football is played now. A traditional partnership up top is far too rigid to challenge now-a-days as it limits the use of crossover runs and tracking back, which is so intrinsic in the modern game. 

Games are won and lost in midfield (just look at Man Utd to see that) where the extra man is absolutely vital in closing down and creating space on the ball, dedicating 2 men to rest up in the final third will lead to an isolation situation where they never see the ball- and with our high press/ passing game, it becomes even more intrinsic to have that extra man.

The classic 4-4-2 was developed in a era when footballers also worked as postmen and lasted probably longer than it should have. The reason that the more creative, continental style became so successful is that is took advantage of the new tool offered to managers: work rate. 

When Wenger took over Arsenal he preached an ethic of management that relied on no weak links in the team from the first until the last, and when he finally got his team ticking over the way he wanted he moved away from the standard two up top, pushed Bergkamp far deeper than his 'traditional' position, and even had Henry tracking back more than a traditional front man would. He then took this even further in his next itteration of the team, playing RVP as a false 9, the highest player up the pitch in the (now familiar)  4-2-3-1, which has become almost standard practise for top teams. 

---

Also, if I am brutally honest, even if we did play a more direct style where 4-2-2-2 was an option (say, like West Ham) and cut out that midfield.. We just don't have the personal. Vellios is at best a mid level championship player, and Jelevic has proved that he is incapable of sustaining anything that resembles form in the final third... We have neither the team, nor the system to pull this off, and we are playing fantastic, efficient football under our current style.. So, why change?

Rome's eventual downfall was not purely the result of them giving citizenship to all people in the empire, there were many different factors contributing to the downfall. (I assume this is what a racist would refer to when discussing Rome's downfall)

The impact of the review was that the regional assemblies in their current form and function would not continue and that the Regional Development Agencies were given executive responsibility for developing the single regional strategy.[6]
The regional chambers were abolished between 2008 and 2010 with their executive functions transferring to the Regional Development Agencies. Local authorities were given an increased role in scrutiny at the regional level including scrutiny of Regional Strategies and the RDAs through participation in new Local Authority Leaders' Boards which were established in each region. The two bodies would jointly produce new single regional strategies, with Ministers exercising an oversight function.

There is this inconvenient subtlety sometimes where if you get like-minded people in a group discussing to each other about their similarity of experiences, if they happen to be very passionate about something which has genuinely worked for them in their lives, those people may appear to look like ideologues to you. Reality very often turns out not to only be resolutely non-partisan, but also non-centrist - it frequently appears to 'switch' political direction depending on the efficiencies of 'politically winged' ideas in situations of varying complexity due to change. This 'switching', is, of course, is an illusion caused by the real variance that is the successes and flaws in ideological personalities. For the same reason, **you can't actually sit on the fence,** no matter how hard you try - not only is there effectively no definition of the fabled 'centre', ([Overton Window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), anyone?) values can jump and swap around - it is totally not impossible, for example, for a fiscally right-wing, authoritarian, and secular government to exist as these values are not in direct contradiction (As if that stopped anyone in politics from believing in whatever shit it is they believe in.) 

So, next time I go up to my friends and have a conversation with them, and they turn out to agree with me due to their genuine opinions and choices, please excuse us for being such insufferable circlejerkers, just because we happen to have a bit of fucking solidarity. Please.

Labour attempted to answer the West Lothian question in a way that would be advantageous to them. An English parliament would most likely be dominated by the Conservatives and would be hard to Labour to win a majority.

So Labour proposed regions that would maximise their gains and minimise their losses. The problem is that many of these counties that were put together did not have a cohesive regional identity that matched what Labour offered.

However there are regional identities in England. Here is a map created by MIT based upon phone calls to create a social picture of the UK: http://imgur.com/7wxE7np.jpg

And here is a series of regional maps based upon that data. Map B is their preferred model (C was an alternative created by someone else on the project interpreting and altering the data gathered differently): http://i.imgur.com/W35inGQ.jpg

Here's the website about the project: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014248#pone-0014248-g002

We can see that they don't really fit the artificial regions that were proposed.

I support devolution (I'd like to see a federal UK with parity of devolved powers)  and I think that any regional breakdown would have to be based on a combination of map B and C. 

I'll see if I can dig it out but not too long ago I wrote down these map results into a list of regions for England (as I said I'm a fan of devolved and localised government), most of them consisted of three counties (with the exception of the Midlands which would be much larger and would largely correspond with the proposed East and West Midland divisions). 

The only artificial region on the list was the combination of Essex, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire. As you can see on the map they tend to be torn between the spheres of influence of other well defined and recognised areas (London, Thames Valley, East Anglia).

P.S. This is all based upon returning to the historic counties of England

As I said, economics and social economics are far more complicated than that.  You have two sets of people under the poverty line, the answer is not to appease one set by punishing the other if it going to result in *actual death*. There are 200k people over 25 on long term unemployment 2/3 of them are over 50.  

Let's take Dave. Dave is 60 years old and has spent years paying his taxes and NI, unfortunately his washing repair business has been driven under by hotpoint's new warranty scheme (covers many brands and you can buy it even if your machine is already broken which basically makes it any repair for £60). Now, Dave has no tech or washing machine repair qualifications because he learned on the job 40 years ago and hotpoint won't take him on without IT training as they use computers for their parts and jobs system. He can't get that training as he's over 25.  Dave has tried and and tried to get jobs but he lives in Burnely and there is fuck all going and those that do need basic IT.  Dave is *fucked*.  

You want to punish the very very few dole scroungers (people systematically cheating the system are all ""depressed""/""drug addicts"" on the sick *not* the dole) to make Sharon in a factory feel slightly better about being on shit money, you are also going to punish Dave.

I think we are OK for wingers, I really feel like Kone on the right and Mirallas on the left could grow to be a great combo. He hasn't got himself in the team properly so far, but Kone is a talented guy- he has pace, finds space, and works hard. His only issue is that his finishing is far less than clinical- which would be negated if he was deeper on the wing, there must be a reason why Bobby Martin has not tried him though- would like to see it attempted however before investing.

Then there is also Deulofeu whose talent with his feet is indisputable, sadly he has the brain of an under 9s player whose only move is to take on players and find a shot- whilst it might be an interesting option as an impact sub, I just cant see him being a starter unless he sorts himself out and plays as a member of the team. 

For me Our most essential position to bolster up is CB. If Jags or Distin get injured, we are down to either Stones or Heitinga- now I love Stones, guy is a young talent of immense quality, but as a regular starter for a PL side...

I don't think you understand the implications of the graph.

The red line shows the number of people alive right now with HIV. The white line shows the rate of new HIV infections. You can see that the white line is going down, so fewer and fewer people are getting HIV each year. The risk to any individual is lower. 

The reason the red line goes flat in the middle is because people were dying from infections contracted earlier. Around 1997 the survival rate for HIV improved, so there were fewer deaths. It's actually a good thing that the red line is sloping upwards.

Another thing - contraction of HIV from sexual contact is likely to be very different for people under 18 compared to people over 18. There is absolutely no need to rush.",0,1381613694,null,0,1381613962,0,ccqfcls,t3_1oaxml,t1_ccqfcls,t1_ccqf1hd,null,1429153205,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So if we take this as a given for the moment, there really isn't any problem with making English the official language of the UK and extend special privileges to native languages such as Welsh, Gaelic and Kernewek. In all honesty, the only reason the UK doesn't have an official language is because until the late 20th century there was little reason to even think about the possibility of using other languages. Going forward, it probably does make more sense to make English the official language of the UK though. The idea of immigrants coming to the UK, forming little ghetto's of alien culture where alien languages are primary really hasn't worked out so well so the focus needs to be on integration. A shared language is a prerequisite for this, and not having one is akin to English people moving to the Western Isles and refusing to learn even basic Gaelic.  

Again, everything I'm saying is based on the position that Scotland will either do it's own thing, or that Gaelic is given a similar status to English.

There's a few reasons why you should use a credit or prepaid card if you're concerned. Credit cards typically come with more consumer protection, even for things like ordered goods which didn't arrive.

Also for a debit card, if your account is defrauded for a large amount, then that money will disappear from your account, and you must wait for the whole process of it to be refunded (possibly leaving you with no money in the meantime).

For a credit card, its simply debt, so waiting for that debt to be written off is perhaps less urgent.

There's something very wrong with costs of living and wages when you have that situation. But also, why do the government give you money for having kids (especially since they are already schooling them for free, giving them free healthcare and everything else)? Why do they help you pay rent that you couldn't afford otherwise? Why do we subsidise shitty wages in the form of working tax credit?

Hell, we should probably try to phase out state pensions, with enough years of warning to allow people to save up for their own futures. Pensions are an enormous part of government expenditure, but it inherently doesn't make sense to tax people their entire lives then slowly give them the money back. Why not just let them keep it for themselves and save all the waste that happens in between?

Firstly, in terms of ""shame"", I suggest we stop the ""Okay, boys, you're going off with Mr. X to watch the boy video. Girls, you're going with Mrs. X to watch the girl video."" Keep them together to watch all. This was in Primary School. The boys' video went in a lot of detail about male puberty and skimmed over the female changes very quickly. Make those equal too. I think it would ""normalise"" it in young folk if males and females watched the videos together.  

Throughout my educational career, there was zilch, nada, *nothing* at all on any other sexuality than heterosexuality. I'm not saying we should teach young children about anal sex between two men, but at least make them acknowledge the existence of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans.  

Normalise masturbation. Even in Year 10 in Biology, myself and classmates were red-faced and giggling at the talk of masturbation. Masturbation is 100% normal and natural, and I think it's safe to say that most young folk do it. Why is it still such a beetroot-faced topic in 15 year olds? Especially with females. Females in High School denied until they were blue in the face that they ever touched themselves. ""Masturbation-shaming"" is...so archaic it's ridiculous.  

Porn education. School kids *need* to know that the majority of porn videos that are so easily accessible is **not** what ""real"" sex is like. Telling them that porn is wrong is wrong, but they *need* to know that they aren't accurate portrayals. I'm genuinely scared that we're raising a generation of teenagers who thinks 3 men shoving their cocks into 1 female is ""normal"" and that ""everyone does it, right?""",0,1381616730,null,0,1381617343,0,ccqgaau,t3_1obd0b,t1_ccqgaau,t3_1obd0b,null,1429152768,36,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,36

It's practically impossible, through these uses of austerity to actually save money. There's serious economic problems with the cuts that many economists state and shouting ""CUT EVERYTHING"" is a stupid plan. This is especially true when you're the opposition and you don't actually know the accounts. 

Secondly, if the labour cuts will be worse than the tories, then presumably we're going to see labour cease to oppose the tories' proposed cuts. 


Thirdly, from a  political perspective, everyone knows that the tories are the party that genuinely believe in cuts. If you want smaller benefits then you know where to go. By making this claim labour loses the support of its core voters and lure only the smallest number of swing voters- they inevitably damage themselves.

- Boys are very very very curious about wet dreams. They seem to genuinely not understand it at all no matter how you describe it.   

- Experimenting (e.g., two boys watching/helping each other masturbate) is damn shameful and gay as hell. [It's understandable why it's embarrassing though, and great friendships can be torn apart by it. That needs some work too. Also, if you do that, you're not necessarily gay or bi.]

The teacher explained some things (And for some ungoldy reason said to a room of 12/13 year olds ""I don't know why it's called a blowjob when you suck"") and then put on a video- I don't remember much but I remember a naked child (i think it was blurred out or darkened) running and then jumping onto his parents bed, they were also naked (which is a bit weird in hindisght...), the parents then got out of bed and as they walked down the hallway the video froze and zoomed into their genitalia and transitioned into a cartoon of their indsides. I don't really remember much but I remember something about how a womens eggs move around and leave the body and stuff- no mention of pareiods of anything like that though.

There was just one class with a video, none of this condom bananana stuff I hear so much about and frankly I'm glad because that sounds extremely akward- Not to mention that my willy doesn't look anything like a bananana so I don't see how it could be educational in the slightest.

I don't remember all the details, but I think at both primary and secondary there was some degree of gender separation - commonalities were taught unseparated, then there were some male-only/female-only talks.

We had a fun assortment of videos and discussions about pregnancy/childbirth (including frank/uncensored shots of a baby coming out), all the various sorts of contraception, wet dreams being a thing that happen, STDs being a thing to avoid. Some cringe-inducing stuff with ""Real Teenagers"" talking about misconceptions/odd experiences they'd had (the one that stands out in my memory was the poor girl who dislocated her jaw mid-blowjob)

It was a fairly comprehensive going-over of the mechanical side of things, but a bit lacking on the emotional/relationship side of things. Not so much *how* to have sex as why, or why not to. I guess that's trickier to cover than just ""penis goes in the vagina"", but some useful tidbits I unfortunately had to learn the hard way...

* Try to have a sense of humour about it - things will go wrong/stupid and that's okay. Sex is inherently a little ridiculous.

* If you can't say the words for genitals with a straight face, that'll make it really hard to talk about what's working and what's not.

* You definitely want to be talking about what's working and what's not.

* Pay close attention to your partner throughout in case it's gotten to be uncomfortable for them and they haven't said so.

* If anything hurts, you're doing something wrong.

The first sex ed we had was in year 5 when they basically took all the DFABs into a room and explained periods and body hair and stuff. In my opinion, this was much too late as I was already developing breasts and some people might have got their periods by then. (btw, PE changing arrangements were mixed up until year 5 or 6 too, which was Not Good for similar reasons). The teacher asked us if we wanted to see the ""boy's video"" too and showed it to us, but as far as I know DMAB people didn't get any sex ed til Year 6 or 7. 

Our secondary school was v good at teaching us 1) how not to get pregnant and 2) how not to catch STIs from PIV sex. Including putting condoms on rubber thingies. [edit: not that I've ever been able to put a condom on someone, so unsure how useful it was]. However, other types of sex were definitely definitely neglected -- I remember it being mentioned that gay people existed, but there was nothing about dental dams or going down on a vagina or anal or whatever. It was sort of all within the frame of PIV being the ultimate thing and other sex acts being a type of foreplay or something, sort of.

I think it would be great if non-PIV stuff could be mentioned in a fairly gender- and orientation- neutral way ie not ""some lesbians might want to use dental dams"" but ""if you're putting your mouth on something you might want a barrier"", not ""gay men do anal"" but ""some people with arseholes do anal"".

true,Onychomycosis,eng-kent,Kent,"I wish I could be more help, but I started secondary school in 1983 so I'm not entirely convinced that I went through the 'current' system.  However, just as a historical note on how attitudes have changed since then, we were openly told in our 'social education' class that being gay was wrong.  This was at the local state comprehensive and I remember the lesson quite clearly - the teacher (also a lay preacher who taught religious education) went into some detail about how unnatural homosexuality was.  He told us that he could spot gay men by the way they walked, and this was something to do with them having lost their bowel continence through anal sex.  Fortunately I didn't believe a word of it, but I find it incredible that he had the temerity to spout this nonsense to a class of receptive children.  Besides this appalling episode, our sex education was very dry and matter-of-fact.  An awful lot about pregnancy and childbirth, some vague diagrams of anatomy; of course, no mention at all that sex is enormous fun.

I'm a GP now, and sexual health is a bit of a pet subject of mine.  I suspect I'm a little biased towards the need for dispelling the numerous myths surrounding contraception and STIs.  I worry about peer pressure and coercion in the sex lives of children (and adults for that matter), and I worry that much of the focus of professionals (including my own) is largely negative - ""you WILL get chlamydia"", ""the condom WILL break"" etc.

If I were to add to my strictly precautionary messages above, I think it would be good to talk about the whole spectrum of sexuality, and how heterosexuality represents a pretty narrow band within that spectrum.  I'd also like children to learn about consent, what it means, doesn't mean, and why it's so important.  I'd also quite like to show tons of photos of real naked people, though I suspect this might raise a few eyebrows at the governors meeting.  Just to show the enormous variety in breasts, vulvas and penises - and how far the 'ideal' bodies are from being 'normal'.

true,ohmyholymoley,null,null,"I went to a state primary school where in y5 we were split into two groups by gender and went through separate cards about what boys and girls went through. It was all very, you're a girl so this is what you need to know, you're a boy so this is what you need to know. Also I know in the boys' talk they briefly covered orgasm and masturbation, which were not mentioned at all in the girls' talk.
I then went to a private all girls secondary school where in y9 we went through the exact same cards we'd gone through at my old school in y5, but this time we went over the boys' ones as well, and again, talked about penile stimulation and ejaculation and male masturbation, without any mention of the clitoris or g-spot or even acknowledgement of the fact that females too have sexual urges. We were taught about the biology of puberty fine for people with ovaries, but not much at all really in regards to people with testes. The idea of intersex people was briefly mentioned. In y11 we had more social based sex ed about relationships and sexual health. Contraception hadn't been mentioned at all up until this point which seemed ridiculous as many people had been sexually active for years and my class had multiple pregnancy scars in y9. The teacher constantly said boyfriend, even though they should have been saying partner and even though my friends and I regularly pointed out that they should be saying partner. Trans people were briefly acknowledged, but anyone falling outside gender binary was not. Homosexuality was brifly mentioned, although the teacher's first response when it came up was always to say, but it could be just a phase. Bisexuality was briefly mentioned, pretty much as a response to homosexuality being brought up and being the second option considered, after it's just a phase. Other sexual orientations such as asexuality and pansexuality were never mentioned. The difference between romantic orientation and sexual orientation was never even considered. The only type of relationship discussed was monogamy and promiscuity was always discussed in a judgmental manner. The emotional side of being in a relationship was never really discussed. Abusive relationships and sexual assault within relationships were never discussed. The idea of consent was never discussed. The lesson on rape pretty much boiled down to don't drink too much and don't seem ""easy"". Sex was taught as completely heteronormative, with ""actual"" sex being PIV. Anything which wasn't heterosexual sex between cis partners who were doing some combination of manual genital stimulation, oral genital stimulation or PIV was ignored and not mentioned. The idea of sex being enjoyable was barely mentioned. Sex was always taught as an eventuality in a relationship that lasted long enough, even if the people weren't sexually active yet, they would be eventually. I remember being given a load of cards with various ""stages of a relationship"" on them like ""Texting each other"", ""Oral sex"", ""Holding hands"" and ""Meeting your partner's parents"" and being asked to split into groups and put them in the order we think they should go in, as though there were a standard order in which a relationship should progress. One group put ""Handjobs/fingering"" really early on (due to not knowing what they meant) and the teacher told them that they should put it later on. A lot of it seemed quit slut-shaming. Part way through the year we were asked what topics we would like to cover in the next few lessons and my friends and I replied with all the stuff I've listed that was lacking. Some of the stuff the teacher took on board, but they flat out said that it wasn't worth teaching us about gender identity and sexuality because it wasn't that important. We also asked if school could either have a condom machine or the school nurse be able to hand out condoms (seriously there were so many pregnancy scares and actual pregnancies it was ridiculous) but the school said no because it ""sent out the wrong idea"".

true,Nickeddu,null,null,"A longboard has a wider deck which give your feet more to work with in balancing and steering. The extra length means the trucks are farther apart so it pitches at less of an angle as it goes over bumps, as well as helping it flex to absorb shock which also makes the ride smoother. 

All these factors make for a steadier, smoother, faster ride for people who aren't looking to do tricks and just want to get from A-B efficiently. 

The cons are that longboards tend to have a wider turning radius and are too long to carry vertically by the trucks. [Mine](http://i.imgur.com/B0xVhXM.jpg?1) has a tail I can easily kick-turn with for manueverability, and I cut in handles to carry it horizontally like a suitcase, so there are ways to work with that.

Think of the difference between a BMX and a mountain bike. Which would you rather ride for a mile?

Wow. 

So, objectively, let us put the subject matter to one side. A state-funded school is actively hindering their own pupils in achieving academic and future life success? 

The school should be closed and the pupils moved elsewhere. I'm sorry but that's unacceptable in our modern world. 

Put religion aside. What they've actually done is hindered the academic achievement of pupils **on purpose**. For a school that should be criminal.

You'd think that an actual statute outlawing this would deter the police from joining in, given that it does somewhat clarify what their government thinks about these sorts of lists, but then this is Special Branch we're talking about.

Depends. You have to balance between making the UK competitive with reasonable tax rates, allowances etc and also raising sufficient money from them. However I think our problem is partly caused by overspending. Trying to raise more and more money to cover it seems like going in circles if we keep spending more. Don't you feel that if tomorrow we managed to bring in an extra £100bn of tax, the government would find some way to spend it straight away?

&gt;Also, you're as mad as a box of frogs if you can't see why a state backed pension is necessary.

I can see why we think it is necessary. But its incredibly expensive. We should retrain our national mentality and encourage people to be more independent, rather than rely on government so much. Also, have you thought about the effect on our democracy - assuming this law could get passed, it would mean that old people wouldn't completely dominate government policy.

true,TripleHekate,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I'm 31 and went through something called PSHE in 'bog standard' comprehensives in the mid 90s. (Personal, Social, Health Education.) I'm female so no idea about the guy side.

A lot of the girl's sex ed about periods and puberty came from the Tampax Lady who showed up, gave a talk and handed out free samples - first in year 8 and again in year 9. She was excellent, and didn't aggressively push Tampax, but it's shocking that we had to rely on a promotional advertising talk to get this info.

The Tampax lady was matter of fact, warm and funny, talked a bit about old-fashioned methods for dealing with periods and made us all feel at ease. Thanks, Tampax lady!

Sex-wise, we got the biological side in year 9 science classes.

I recall little bits and pieces we did on methods of contraception (again, purely scientific) and some stuff about abortion debates. I can't remember any education about relationships, rape/pressure to have sex, porn, non-hetero couples etc.

The broad message was **'Sex is shameful, we hate talking about it, don't have sex, but if you MUST, use a condom. LGBT people don't exist.'**

Result, I was chronically embarrassed about sex for years and got all my sex ed from the Internet and Dan Savage's columns. (Look at Scarlateen for a great sex ed website)

What would have helped me growing up and helped me make better decisions?

* TALK OPENLY! Talk without shame or embarrassment about sex and sexual desire! Make it seem a normal part of life. The kids are always going to be shy about it, but sex was always treated as gross and nasty by the teachers and it badly affected what I thought of sex as well. Get good, warm, fun speakers who can make the kids feel a bit more at ease. If you stand up and talk about condoms and roleplay asking to use one, it makes it easier for the teenagers in the audience to do it themselves when they have to.

* tell everyone that sex is supposed to be enjoyable for both people. There are lots of reasons to have sex (good and bad), but it's always supposed to feel good. This is particularly important for the girls. Lots of them won't really have masturbated or worked out what feels good. A lot of younger women put up with pain and soreness during sex (anecdata!). They can be unaware that sex is more than 'he sticks his dick in you and rams away, you roll your eyes in extacy and orgasm automagically', and feel embarrassed about saying 'we need lube' or 'that hurts!' or 'you need to give me oral'.

* Briefly cover non-STD sexual problems (phimosis, vaginisimus, thrush, etc). There was a SCARY reddit thread where this guy insisted it was normal to bleed when you masturbated until your foreskin was 'stretched enough' to move freely!

* Talk about online porn. A lot. Explain that it's movie sex, unreal, and what people do in porn is not what people enjoy in real life. It's fine to watch porn, but your sexual experiences don't have to be like that. Eg, spitting on a woman's crotch as lube. That is unreal - it barely works in practice!

* Following on, talk about how everyone likes different stuff. Stuff that's held up as the Gold Standard of Sex that Everyone Wants (blowjobs, anal, etc) is not for everyone. Some people dislike receiving oral sex, and so on, and there's nothing wrong with that.

* TALK ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. Talk about blaming the victim. Talk about non-hetero rape and women raping men. I left school thinking that women who were raped while drunk had done something wrong. Explain what happens when you go to the police and make a rape complaint. Get someone in from the local rape crisis centre to talk about it. So many women I know were assaulted and didn't go to the police because they were ashamed or thought it wouldn't do any good.

* Masturbation is for both genders, not shameful. Boys, don't grip your dick so tightly you end up not being able to come with more gentle stimulation. Girls, don't stick weird stuff up your vagina. (I don't know if you can get away with telling teens this in school, but just in case...!)

* Get away from 'girls who like/want/have lots of sex are bad and disgusting', and away from 'men are sex pigs 24/7 and you're not a man if you don't want sex'.

* Discuss 'outercourse', things you can do that aren't penetrative sex. Eg, mututal masturbation, oral sex, frottage. 

* finally talk about LGBT sexuality and relationships, and when discussing all the above things don't be hetero-specific if possible. The handful of gay/questioning kids in the class will appreciate it, and it will challenge the straight kids to be more open-minded.

Protecting yourself from what, exactly?

When was the last time you were attacked by a Muslim? When was the last time a Muslim acted on a threat towards you? When was the last time a Muslim did anything to threaten you?

You people are hilarious. You act as if you're likely to get mugged by every Muslim you meet. I'm speaking from the heart of Bradford right now which has a muslim population of around 10% if not more and I can tell you for absolute certainty muslims aren't the problem.

The problem is the drunk fucking dole wasting scum who continually try make it out to be a ""brown person problem"" when in reality the people they seem to demand protection from are the one's who have stable homes, stable jobs and are generally productive members of society.

Opposed to the majority of EDL Supporters who are loud, obnoxious hate mongers who cause more problems than the people they're supposedly trying to protect Britain from.

So while you call for moderate Muslims to out the extremists (I'm not sure how you expect this to happen? You do realise being Muslim doesn't mean you know every other muslim and how extremist they are, right?) I'll call for all moderate Britains to out the hate mongers, lets get 'em on a boat and ship them back to Poland. I know they're not all from Poland, but we might as well use the same short sightedness that the EDL continually uses, right?

Many of the things I would have suggested have already been posted so I won't go on to repeat them. However, I wanted to mention something from my own personal experience, though I'm not sure if this will fit into your teachings. If it doesn't, it may just be something worth considering when you're formulating ways in which to convey your message. 

I'm 27, female, and myself and many of my friends would agree that we were taught about contraception and safe-sex alongside the notion that pregnancy is shameful and an indicator of failure. At the time the UK was battling a high rate of teenage pregnancy, so it's plain to see why these messages were portrayed alongside each other. The issue is, these teachings, and the stigma that developed with it, very much affects the attitudes of others and spills over in to adulthood. My sister had a child when she was eighteen. She was of legal age, in a long term relationship at the time and looking to buy a house. To this day (some thirteen years later) she still detects a lot of negative attitudes when others work out the difference between her and her daughters age.

I don't currently have any children, but I frequently witness a tone of shock and disappointment from others when they learn of friends and acquaintances who've started a family. Almost as if they assume they could have/should have achieved so much more before beginning a life sentence (because they couldn't have ever possibly wanted to start a family on purpose!)

By no means do I think we should encourage young women to have children in their teens, but alongside the teachings of safe-sex and contraception should also be the acknowledgement of how amazing reproduction really is :)

true,Innogen,null,null,"I went to an all female catholic convent school (but my sex ed took place 25 years ago so I hope some aspects have changed.)

We had a talk when we were 11 about periods and puberty which took place in our domestic science class. (I don't know why.)  That was pretty useful as I recall as the teacher explained periods very well and allowed us to ask questions.  I do vividly remember being confused about towels and tampons, and thought that once your periods began you had to wear them all the time.  I did summon up the courage to ask (and was relieved to find out I was wrong!) Others asked equally odd specific questions - length of time for a period (thinking it was a month long), strength of flow (expecting a crimson tidal wave to erupt) and so on.  I think you have to really go into the very basic details.  A lot of my class had the bare facts but had built very strange ideas on top of them.  I now wonder what else people believed but weren't brave enough to query.

Sex was covered in biology when we were about 11 or 12.  We had a young female teacher who again was lucid on how it worked, and answered questions bluntly.  There was a catholic slant to it - sex in marriage being touted as the ideal - but we were also told it was pleasurable and the mechanics of contraception was touched upon but only from the perspective of how it stopped conception.  There was no putting condoms on bananas or explanations of how you got to go on the pill.  There was no advice given on how to deal with the fact that you were going to want to have sex, no debate on whether it was a good idea.  You were told how it worked, and generally told that you shouldn't really do it.  No mention of masturbation.  No information how to do it safely if you decided on going for it.  Nothing actually useful.

When were 15 or so we covered the ethics of sex in RE.  (This is the part that really, really makes me cross when I think back.)  We did abortion (bad, bad, bad according to the teacher) in quite graphic detail.  Then, in another class, we got to LGBT sexuality.  We walked in and there was a one-sided sheet of A4 on the desk with a list of questions and answers.  We were told to read it - one of the questions was 'Are all gay people pedophiles.'  The answer was 'No' but, really, FFS!  When we had read the sheet that was supposed to the end of the matter but some of us insisted on discussing the issue and told the teacher that we thought it was a disgraceful excuse for a lesson.  Rather wonderfully we found out exactly the same thing happened in the other RE class taking place at the same time.  In that one, however, the teacher told her class that if her child was gay she would send them for therapy.  The whole thing was insane and I shudder to think how any gay member of the class felt while this went on.  (No one was openly gay at school, despite the rumours about convent girls, but I know that at least 2 women were gay and came out after leaving school.)  At the end of the lesson we were packed off and the subject was not returned to.  One hour, mostly consisting of angry shouting, was the sum total given to LGBT issues in all our education.

In the final year of our a-levels the school did manage to provide us with one useful thing.  We had one whole day devoted to HIV and AIDS.  Various youth workers came in, we were split into small groups and did workshops on STDS and how to avoid them.  All was useful, practical information but, considering we were 18 by then, most of us had already had sex quite a while before this.  The end of the day made a very deep impression on me.  A man came in who was in the latter stages of AIDS.  He talked very, very candidly about he got it, what the effects were and why we should consider our sexual health when we were having sex.  He also very honestly said how much fun sex was and how he didn't want to put us off, just wanted to make sure we careful.  He really managed to deliver the message effectively.  It was a stroke of genius whoever booked him.

Thinking back, I think I got most of my information from books and magazines which can't be good really.  My closest friends would talk honestly to one another but I am not sure everyone had that to rely on.  We had filled in a magazine quiz once where 3 of us had ticked that we masturbated.  Others in our class all said we were disgusting. Another time our form teacher told us that if we had casual sex then men were using us just like they would use a mattress.  I have never quite worked out what that analogy was supposed to mean.  It leads me to wonder about her husband's sexual technique.

All in all, I wish we had been spoken to about LBGT sexuality, masturbation and experimentation, and been given more tools for deciding what we wanted from sex.  I suppose a Catholic school is never going to be handing out free condoms but their approach, which was to expel anyone who got pregnant or anyone they found out had had an abortion, was just useless.

Let's take your example of gravity, Newton's equations explaining gravity were vastly different to Einstein's equations but they fit better,  bam gravity changed because Einstein's equations better fit the real world, it modeled mercury's orbit much better. 
Science doesn't show what is true but what our best understanding is at the time. Yeah I believe evolution is true the evidence is so great that I am convinced. What is proof though is maths with maths there is a definitive answer to something like 1 = 0.9 recurring.

I see you've fallen into the trap of regulation = total control. If we look at the car industry regulation demands it meets safety standards but nobody is controlling just how to achieve those standards.

The same would be with the press. Specific, clearly defined, legislation about what can and cannot be broadcast is not total control of the press. The latter are whipping up hysteria because they seek to lose their profitable enterprises in the name of integrity. Ever noticed how the press is never  ever to blame in their reports?

That focussed on puberty, and the girls and boys were separated (in a way I think this was better as you were less embarassed to ask questions), but we got together at the end to talk about what we had learned (this consisted mostly of giggling). One thing I don't think was emphasized enough is that the age of starting puberty varies a lot between people and that is perfectly normal. My best friend had already started her period at this point, so I guess for the early ones like that they need puberty education before the final year of primary school. For me, I didn't start my period till I was 14 and I felt like a bit of a freak. The one girl who had well developed boobs at the age of 10 was teased about that too. So emphasise the natural variation, but also what is not normal and should cause you to see a doctor. (I had *really* irregular periods and I had no idea if that was something to worry about or not).
In secondary school we had sex education that focussed more on sex. We were shown how to use a condom etc. I never remember learning much about male puberty. As far as I can remember, masturbation and anything other than PIV sex were never mentioned. Anything like that you just had to pretend you knew what people were talking about on the playground (they probably didn't either). One thing that would have been useful to me was to learn all of the slang rather than having to guess and pretend. My now-partner finds it strange that I didn't just look it up onn the internet (that is probably easier for kids now), but I didn't have that easy/private access to the internet.
Masturbation was not portrayed as shameful (at least in the sex ed class, it was generally), it was just never mentioned as far as I remember. It is a pretty important thing to be leaving out of sex ed.

I went to a CofE primary school and we had education about puberty and basic sex ed in year 5 and/or 6 I think. I'm pretty sure we were separated into boys/girls for most of it. Vague memories of a video about pregnancy and possibly giving birth? Not sure.

In secondary school (not religious or anything, just a normal secondary) we had the biology parts covered in science, and more general sex ed under PSHE lessons, which I think we had over quite a few years. I remember we were shown how to put on condoms (except they used an out of date one and it snapped, which was quite entertaining) and we had some kind of quiz to do where we were giving symptoms and nicknames of STDs and had to match them up with the correct STD. We were also told about a variety of different contraceptive options. Well, I went on the pill at 15 and I knew a fair bit about it before that, so I presume it was either taught or I researched it myself, haha. I can't remember many more specifics though...I don't recall anything specifically covering any LGBT issues, or masturbation.

Other things I would like to see:

* More discussion of LGBT issues.
* Info about consent, rape and sexual assault. Something about slut shaming and the horrible culture around that.
* Things like thrush and BV (I only learnt about BV in the last couple of years!), and how to avoid them and what the symptoms are. Also, UTIs and how women especially should make sure they pee after sex.
* General boobs and bra education - so many girls have no idea about a good fit and end up with a lot of back pain and confidence issues. If I knew some more about bra fitting and actually had a sports bra that fit, I might have actually felt a bit more confident about participating in PE lessons. Also, showing what normal boobs look like, e.g. [this gallery](http://www.007b.com/breast_gallery.php), and how to check for lumps.
* An opportunity for the pupils to ask anonymous questions that they might be too embarrassed to bring up in front of friends.

true,Anonamous_Quinn,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Ok, so I went to state comprehensives, primary and secondary, and got taught sex ed at both, but the course was absolutely identical so I'll only cover it once.

We were taught, I felt, fairly well. It covered quite extensively the female menstrual cycle, how reproduction works, and to my knowledge every kind of birth control available including the rates of success that they have.

We were also taught about sexually transmitted diseases, how people can be carriers and show no signs of infection and how the only real option there is condoms.

We also had anonymous question and answer sections, where people could write embarrassing questions they had down, put them in a hat and the teacher would answer all of them as best as he/she could. I thought this was brilliant, you got a few silly questions in there but it was worth it for the educational benefit when someone was confused.

We were taught about pornogrophy, and about masturbation and that it's fine, both by a video we were shown (which I felt really worked, it avoided the teachers having to get too close to what was clearly a very personal affair).

I also remember being taught about intersex, though I seem to remember it being referred to as transexualism, which is wrong. This did confuse me for a long time so I would implore you to make sure you get your definitions correct.

Of course, this being 1999 and 2000 ish respectively, Section 28 was still very much in effect and I was not taught about the existence of homosexuality. Literally didn't know it was a thing, I had to go look it up in a library somewhere around 2006 and I then spent years terrified to tell anyone I was gay. I shouldn't have been, but because I'd never heard of it I was afraid it was wrong.

Also on my list of things that I would have like to have known are that pornography, while fine to watch, isn't realistic. Seriously, please tell kids that it's all staged and that sex is so vastly, vastly different. If you can at all, least try to mention oral and anal sex (but for heaven sake keep it separate to homosexuality, straight people do this too so don't give anyone, including the kids, that your teaching them how to have gay sex), if you can cover the basics such as condoms (even oral, the singular mention of oral sex I had was someone in a video talking about getting genital warts to the face) and lube for anal sex.",0,1381663862,null,0,false,0,ccqr1ps,t3_1obd0b,t1_ccqr1ps,t3_1obd0b,null,1429147603,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Worst case scenario though:

There are about 2m EU immigrants living in UK (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-11072012-AP/EN/3-11072012-AP-EN.PDF)

'Millions and Billions' does make the issue sound significant - so far so that people believe a far bigger portion of our pot were fraudulently claimed. These statistics show an estimate of the real percentage which is a lot lower that our suspicions. Yes, benefit fraud is wrong morally, however we should take the wider costs of social spending into account. 

I think these statistics show that if Benefit Fraud is a serious problem, then Benefit Underpayment is a serious problem too.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"I can't remember much of my school sex education. I don't think there was an awful lot of it. In middle school I remember our very sultry actually-French French teacher showing us how to put a condom on a banana. 

I very much admire and identify with your stated aims. It would be a very positive step, I feel, to move away from sex education rooted in the notion of gender and sexuality as distinct categories. I know Kinsey's work is a bit dated and not necessarily held in the highest regard any more, but if you can find data with similar conclusions about the spectrum of sexual experiences, I really feel that would help ease the notion that people fit neatly into distinct groups and that only a tiny number of people ever have any same-sex desire, which just isn't the case. Explaining the quite complex relationship between sexuality and gender identity would be positive too. [This video does a pretty good job](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAoG8vAyzI). It's complicated for people without first-hand experience to understand these concepts and I think the confusion is a source of a lot of prejudice and discrimination. That video goes through the various forms of identity at a breakneck pace, but it's quite enlightening to be able to perceive all these different forms of variation.

In purely sexual terms, I think people do need to learn that it's okay to masturbate, that they should be equipped with a knowledge of genital variation and what is and isn't healthy (such as the aforementioned Fordyce's spots, which can definitely freak people out needlessly. Also, phimosis, which a lot of people don't understand. I knew a guy who had phimosis but thought that was just what having a foreskin was. His sex life could have been greatly improved if he had been able to self-diagnose and pursue medical assistance to fix it). I think that different sexual practices need to be explained, including the mechanics and health risks of anal pleasuring. People from across the spectrum of sexuality engage in it, and they need to be able to know how to make it as hygienic as possible. It'd be nice if young men were taught to understand that it feels good because it stimulates the prostate, and that it isn't inherently 'gay' to experiment with anally pleasuring oneself. That's an important message even for young men who will never experiment with it, because appreciating that it is pleasurable might help to diffuse the homophobic-sexist notion that MSM engage in anal intercourse to 'replace the vagina' and that it is inherently submissive and effeminate. Bottoming isn't about wanting to be a woman, it feels good. 

Speaking of the word 'effeminate', it really gets on my nerves. So-called effeminate behaviour often has nothing to do with the way that women behave, and whilst there's nothing wrong with people's self-expression, it's incorrect and offensive to link it with sexuality or assume that non-hetero men can be divided into 'effeminate/camp' and 'masculine/non-camp/'straight-acting''. This too is part of a spectrum, and if a 'straight-acting' man (hetero or not) loves rugby but also baking, he shouldn't feel imprisoned by that, or vice versa. I don't feel personally that I come across one way or the other.

Anyway, lecture over. I hope I'm not preaching to the choir too much. I can elaborate or speak further if you would like. ",0,1381668044,null,0,false,0,ccqrlfs,t3_1obd0b,t1_ccqrlfs,t3_1obd0b,null,1429147348,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Now, if someone committed kidnap, or child abduction, I would expect they'd get put in prison. However, you can get done for assault for getting into a fight, which I don't think should necessarily carry a jail term if it is the first time you've done it. 

I don't think we should be going for tougher sentencing for the sake of having tougher sentencing. As long as we reduce the amount of people committing crimes multiple times, then I would rather move towards using more community sentences and rehabilitation efforts.

&gt;George Osborne on Sunday announced that the Beijing Construction Engineering Group had entered the £800m project to redevelop Manchester airport as the chancellor kicked off his five-day tour of China.

&gt;BCEG will join Carillion and the Greater Manchester Pension Fund to build a business district at the airport. It is the first of a series of deals that the chancellor is expected to unveil on a visit that Britain hopes will unlock a wave of Chinese investment in UK infrastructure.

&gt;Mr Osborne is also expected to sign a deal allowing a state-owned Chinese company to build nuclear power stations in the UK and have its reactor design approved by British regulators. Under the deal, the government will give its backing to Chinese General Nuclear Power Group entering EDF’s planned new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point.

&gt;BCEG is backed by the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank. Mr Osborne pitched the deal as evidence that his government wanted to spread investment across the UK.

&gt;“I am determined that Britain does not repeat the mistakes of the past that saw investment and growth only concentrated in the City of London, important as it is; but instead to make sure investment from China flows to all parts of the country. Our economic plan is about securing a recovery for all parts of the country.”

&gt;China’s stake in the new Airport City “enterprise zone” in Manchester will be one of the country’s biggest investments in the UK outside London. The project will transform 150 acres of scrubland and parking into 5m sq ft of offices, shops and parkland, creating an estimated 16,000 jobs in the next 15 years.

&gt;The investments come after a strained period between China and Britain. Diplomatic ties were cut early last year when David Cameron’s decision to meet the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, in London angered Beijing.

&gt;The Chinese government subsequently cancelled numerous meetings with senior UK ministers, leading to concerns that the UK could lose out to France and Germany in its efforts to tap into Chinese investment.

&gt;Relations between the two nations have been restored in recent months and cemented at the G20 summit in St Petersburg this month when Ki Jinping, China’s president, invited Mr Cameron to visit Beijing. The prime minister will lead a trade delegation to China later this year.

&gt;Ed Davey, energy minister, began the rapprochement last month with a 10-day tour to China to drum up investment in Britain’s energy markets.

Line about Mail readers supporting a referendum (with a vague statistic, ""more than half""),

Line about Mail readers supporting a vote in the Commons (another vague number), and then interestingly a claim that fewer than half would actually vote to leave (although that would still be an anti-EU vote),

Line both referring to and subtly attacking David Cameron,

Two lines from Boris Johnson (why him?) one attacking immigration (and the welfare system) and another supporting migration.

-------------------------

We don't know what the EU report says, we have a 2nd hand version of it, with statistics cherry-picked by the Telegraph, no sort of investigation, vague numbers, no real analysis, and named references only to Conservatives.

So I'd go with the article being a bit biased and unreliable - although more to Boris Johnson than UKIP.

There's no easy answer to the question of how to deal with muslim extremists without offending Islam as a whole.

Some people really seem to think that anti-circumcision arguments weaken their outrage over FGM - but really, it's the other way around. It's ridiculous to condemn one type of child genital mutilation whilst condoning another.

Comparing severity is crazy - especially with there being numerous forms of mutilation. How exactly do you draw the line?  Measure the noise of the cries of pain? the quantity of bloody spilled?  (Oh, wait... one drop of female blood is too much, isn't it? But men are disposable. We're not supposed to care too much when male blood is spilled, are we? they've just got to 'man up' and take it!)

Yes, some people (of either gender) prefer circumsised penises. Others like tattoos, unusual piercings, and other body modifications. But it's got to a personal decision by an adult to make these modifications/mutiliations to their body! Religion is no excuse for mutilating a child's body in any way.

It's criminal to be taking a knife to the genitals of any child, unless it's absolutely required to treat a medical condition.

true,RIsForRed,null,null,"I'm sorry, I don't have time to go through the thread so I may be repeating what others have said. Firstly just want to say this is awesome, I'm a trained volunteer with a program that's part of an education and social change movemen. We focus on sex ed, mental health, conflict resolution, provide safe spaces etc. We've made some headway at getting ourselve into schools but it's difficult since the program is run by young people who all have degrees and jobs etc. to juggle at the same time.

Some of the biggest things people tell us about in workshops that they wish they were taught about at school include:

* Consent - The situations in which a person can and cannot give consent (e.g. intoxication, age), as well as the importance of consent and how it can be used in every day life (e.g. asking before hugging someone).
* Masturbation - Tackling the ideas of shame around it. Often male masturbation is covered in sex ed but female masturbation isn't, I remember the explanation of a clitoris we were briefly given confused the fuck out of me for years.

* Virginity - How the idea of virginity can mean different things to different people. For example queer or any non-heteronormative sex might not involve penetration and that does not need to mean they have never had sex. Also ideas about purity, slut shaming and how it having sex does not need to mean ""losing"" anything. I'm not a massive Laci Green fan but she explains it well and some of her videos can be really good for young people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdYtYveJI1Y Also the hymen is often explained wrongly (Laci Green also has a video on this) and methods to make sex less painful should be covered in my opinion.
* Pornography - Adressing the issue that pornography exists and that there is nothing wrong with watching it, yet also discussing the differences between most porn sex and sex for pleasure, as well as the ethics of the porn industry (human trafficking, objectification etc) and the risks of porn addiction.
* Fetish - To at least adress the fact that specific tastes and desires are common, and not sick or disgusting, and can mostly be practiced safely among consenting adults. Also maybe mention sex toys, condoms, lubricants and how they can be bought and used safely (e.g. latex allergies, water vs oil bases lubes, how to put on a condom, risks of anal to vaginal insertion)
* Mental wellbeing - Discussing sex with young people is a great time to teach them about their own personal wellbeing with sex, making sure they and their partners are not being pressured or made uncomfortable, and teaching them that as great as sex is it is not the most important thing in the world and not having it is not a disater, and the importance of **communication** with partners. Body acceptance might also be an issue to bring up, maybe opening discussions about penis size, vaginal tightness and the myths surrounding them. They should also be told where they can go locally to get contraception, STD tests, examinations etc.

Sorry, I know this is long, it's also quite a brief overview really. I love working on this program and we discuss so much in our workshops with people of all ages and backgrounds I could probably talk on this for hours. I was relatively extremely lucky with my sex ed in school but I still think it was woefully incomplete. My friends that went to religious primary or secondary schools often have had no sex ed whatsoever other than maybe ""This is what a condom is, they are a sin."" This means they end up getting all their information from the internet or hearsay, which can go quite wrong.

At my schools we were segregated by gender for sex in in primary school and then we switched and did the boy's side of the lesson and vice versa. In secondary school we were not separated but the majority of the lessons involved watching videos from the 80s which usually just talked about puberty, and often just featured fully grown adults and toddlers, which made discussing adolescence odd. We were also given the oppurtunity to ask anonymous questions by putting slips on paper in a box.

Any more information you'd be willing to give about your organisation I'd be really glad to hear and share with my group. This is a really important issue to us and we were all really lucky to have somewhere to go to learn about it and it's worrying that the majority of the population hasn't had the same.

If you recall the Time Lords offered the Master a new life cycle for his new body which he stole in the Keeper of Traken.

If granting new lives was that easy to do, then the whole premise of the Five Doctors was unnecessary as Borusa could have just had himself zapped with a new life cycle anytime he ran short.

true,SushiSnuglet,null,null,"I (female) went to a very small CofE primary school, where we had some basic sex ed in year 6. Firstly, the parents had to watch the video first to make sure they agreed with it being shown. It was very white-washed and bland, basically ""Tom and Judy have decided to have a baby"", then video of some bed sheets moving up and down, then explaining how the baby ""grows in the woman's tummy"". We also had another lesson with a video explaining some basics of puberty ie hair grows, periods start etc. Also another video entitled ""some of your bits aint nice"" telling us to wash, put deodorant on and make sure we didn't have lice. We weren't segregated for these. I'd already started my periods and was almost done with puberty already so it was all a bit too late for me. 

In my bog standard comprehensive secondary school, we got the biological stuff about sex in science, and it was all about reproduction/hormone cycle etc. In PSE classes in year 7 we had more stuff about periods, and then everything else about sex were these awful cheap videos trying to scare us by saying if you had sex you'd get AIDS. In year 9 we had the put a condom on a carrot thing. The teacher got angry with my friend and I because we refused to touch the thing as it was sticky. I also remember one science lesson where our male teacher invited a female science teacher to the class and then he forced us to ask questions about sex. We had to write them down and put them in a box. He said if we didn't have enough questions, he would point to people and make them ask one, and it was very embarrassing - I mean, who wants to ask about sex in front of a bunch of judgmental teens!! I can't really remember us being gender segregated for things - maybe one bit in year 7, but my memory's a bit fuzzy now (I'm 27 now). 

We didn't get anything about masturbation. We weren't even told women had a clitoris. There was nothing about non-hetrosexual sex. Nothing about consent other than the standard ""sex is bad, it causes disease, don't do it"" thing. Only contraception mentioned was condoms. Nothing about relationships at all, which was utterly stupid. It was all geared in a desperate attempt to stop any of us even contemplating having sex, so there definitely wasn't anything about sex being fun and pleasurable, and people doing it for reasons other than reproduction.

So basically my input is - stop making it sound scary! Sex is not a horrible, taboo thing. It's fun and teenagers are going to want to do it. Yes, give them advice on how to be safe, but don't shame them and scare them so much that they feel ""wrong"" for having totally normal sexual feelings.

Well the IPCC models haven't exactly been accurate, they predicted a temperate change of 0.2 and 0.9 C from 1990 and so far we've had a temperature change of 0.1 C. The Fifth Assessment report also conveniently glosses over the fact we haven't had *any* warning in the last 15 years because it doesn't fit with their models. 

So if we can't model climate accurately, we have no chance of modelling weather over any period of more than a few days. The main reason being is that the UK is smack bang in the middle of 5 different air masses; Polar continental, Polar maritime, Tropical continental, Tropical Maritime and Arctic Maritime, and they all do their own thing.

Do not pay off your mortgage with savings for those reasons. Even if the sky was to fall you'd be no better off.

Sterling is a safe haven currency, and while the value of all equities would be affected by a crash in the dollar, especially UK equities, your £ would not lose value. 

If your bank was to go under, and the UK government didn't honour the savings guarantee scheme then things would be so bad they wouldn't be recognisable from what they are now. The government would likely inflate sterling to meet the requirements of the FSCS meaning you would gain by having a mortgage balance.

Let's look at it another way, this person is able to say something wrong, they have to contend with everybody telling them they're wrong. They have to justify their position, we have to talk about it, and they have to convince me.
If they hold an honest opinion, and seek an honest answer, through the discussion they will change their mind and come to the right answer. 

Or let's try it another way, a person is not allowed to talk about it. Unless they ask themselves some deep, hard questions, they will never change their mind. Being bigoted in their own way for the rest of their life. Maybe that means holding being a group of people to a lesser standard, maybe that means being an arsehole to that group. But an extreme result of this can be violence. For whatever imagined wrong, and bearing such hatred, caring that around without being able to vent and without being challenged by society that they are wrong.

Either way, the only way you can change someone's mind in through discussion. That can only happen through a freedom of speech, which results in some terrible things being said.  This is a core value in all western society. When someone threatens extreme violence they're showing that they don't get that in a big way.

For longer than three months the citizen has to either be in work,^1 or able to support themselves (and their family) without becoming an unreasonable burden on public funds.

So the second part can be denied, quite easily - Member States are, of course, free to waive those requirements if they want. That also means that if any of these ""600,000 unemployed migrants"" are here legally, they're either here for under 3 months, or aren't taking up too much in public funds (or they're here illegally).

Then there's the ""right of permanent residence"", which you are entitled to after living, legally, for 5 continuous years in a Member State. So some of these ""600,000 unemployed migrants"" may have been here, working, for 5+ years already.

There are the general opt-outs on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, but they are for exceptional circumstances.

No one we bring in will have his flair, his determination, and his ability to create something out of nothing.

But if you look at him purely in terms of chances created, goals, and assists, I think there are ways we could replace him in January if we look set to push for CL.

If we're outside the top 4 come Jan 1 then I think we're in trouble in terms of a great replacement.

I do think Jackson Martinez, Costa, and a number of other players could provide roughly the same return as him. Ideally we'd get a guy who could start at striker or a wing position.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;the bank tasked with organising an IPO has lots of other favoured clients who can be 'gifted' the opportunity to buy shares before anyone else

But these banks and their clients are also taking the greatest risk. Look at FB shares. They fucked it up and they took a massive hit. From what I can tell, the original institutional investors are used to ascertain market value at what sort of price to go out at, as these investors in theory should be quite knowledgeable and experienced, so in order to gauge share value these guys can come in handy. And also, they seem to be used as somewhat of a safety net, as guaranteed revenue from the IPO. To me it seems that if all goes well, they will make a decent profit as initial investors, but they do take on more risk than anyone else, and do they do serve as measuring stick for the IPO. So to me it seems that yes, they can do quite well out of it, but it doesn't seem especially corrupt to me. Obviously there are other ways to monetise your IPO which can provide greater value to the company, but this transfers more risk to the company. Understandably, a lot of companies prefer to shift some of the risk onto the institutional investors. It really doesn't seem especially corrupt to me. It does seem like the underwriters can fuck you over, but that's generally how agents work. It's a risk you take.

&gt;Commission v Belgium (1997)

&gt;The effectiveness of Article 48 is secured in so far as Community legislation or, in its absence, the legislation of a Member State gives persons concerned a reasonable time in which to apprise themselves, in the territory of the Member State concerned, of offers of employment corresponding to their occupational qualifications and to take, where appropriate, the necessary steps in order to be engaged.

&gt;In the absence of Community provisions prescribing a period during which Community nationals who are seeking employment may stay in their territory, the Member States are entitled to lay down a reasonable period for this purpose. However, if after expiry of that period, the person concerned provides evidence that he is continuing to seek employment and that he has genuine chances of being engaged, he cannot be required to leave the territory of the host Member State.

In other words EU member states must give job seekers a reasonable time to seek work. In other countries you aren't allowed to claim in this period. Here you are allowed to claim in this period. However after this period expires if you still haven't found a job there needs to be evidence you are likely to find a job soon otherwise you need can be forced to leave member state territory. This basically means the UK will give you benefits only if there is a good chance you will start contributing soon which is not so much of a difference that people would come here over somewhere else. It certainly doesn't mean people would come here and remain unemployed because they can be sent home.

true,NovaClara,null,null,"What is the science behind having the MMR vaccines together? I had them separately and from what I've vaguely heard about the anti-jab people they seem to think the human organism reacts worse to the tripple-whammy of three vaccinations, regardless if they are right or not, I'd like to know what is the reason for administering them together. 



In this case it is very relevant to science and specifically the ethics of science  and law, it is  very much about ethics in medicine and the human rights to ones own body. 

At what point can you force somebody to be reasonable? 

And if you do, does it not violate the principles of liberty and right to self-determination on which our legal system is supposed to be based? 

At some point circumcision was seen as a hygienic, medical necessity, but now some countries, such as Germany legislate against it precisely on the basis of  the right to personal  and bodily integrity of the child. Who is to say that in 100 years the MMR jab will not be seen similarly to circumcision? As a barbarity performed in the name of science?

I would argue that in a case where the person is not capable to give consent, they should have the 'reason' forced on them: their best interest should be represented by their parents or the state, in case where they are not capable of it. 

But in  this case it is not clear that 15 year old is not capable of giving consent, I would very much argue that she is, since in some countries in other areas relating to the body, such as sex 15 is seen as the age of  consent, and even in the UK in few months at the age of 16 she will be seen as capable of working and driving: handling money and responsibility, even for other peoples lives on the road. 

Why would we not trust a teenager with their own body, when we trust them with other responsibility?  I would argue that that since she is capable of consent or lack of it, in this case her right to bodily determination should take precedence over her subjection to 'reason'. After all she could not be coerced to an abortion for example, another medical procedure, she would have to consent to it. How come we treat the capacity to consent and responsibility in teenagers with such schizophrenic split? 


 How are we to create a healthy society of individuals who respect the law and others boundaries if teach young that it is ok to  violate peoples physical liberty if it is in the name of 'reason'?

 Especially when the law is not uniform in the way it treats the issue of bodily determination: abortion: consent required, jab: consent ignored. Yes, it might be for the greater good, but in this case is it really for the greater good? 

Is allowing for a state that violates the right to self-determination of individuals who are seen as capable of consent in other areas really such a step forward?

It is her body, her health,  if there is an outbreak she will be the one to suffer, since presumably the rest will be immunised, right?

Imagine if you lived in a world where castration on genetically inferior males was performed for the common good, and consent was only seen as possible by individuals with an IQ over 130, so the rest would have it performed against their will.  It would be entirely 'reasonable' but would it be truly ethical?

If a girl is old enough to get pregnant she's old enough to be told what the Pill is and most importantly to be taught assertiveness and about her right to say 'no' - boys also need to be taught about this stuff as they can be fathers at very young ages. Parents and teachers need to be aware that kids can start being sexually active at a very young age and they need the risks and inappropriateness of this addressed directly, not pussyfooted around.

We were thrown into a mixed gendered class and watched what amounted to an anotomical break down of male &amp; female genetals combined with 'soft core' prono.  

Beyond covering 'that's a vulva it does x, that's a labia it does y' in a very mechanical fashion little else was discussed.   Masterbation was never mentioned (either for boys or girls) and generally the whole thing was quite an embarrassing mess. 

Then the cucumber and condom appeared, we were demonstrated how to put one on once by the teacher.  No practical was offered and considering the age of most of the boys the cucumber was, I suspect, far larger than they were and most girls seemed rather off put that something that large would be entering them...  contraception was covered in exceptionally general terms and boys lambasted for having it easy. 

Of course I pre-date the wealth of information the Internet can provide, so I was still pondering when my boobs would start growing and my penis fall off which may well have turned a well throughout and informative lesson in to a weekly torture session for a term (yes, I am actually a TS and no gender being different to sex was never even mentioned).

Firstly extensive testing has shown that combining measles mumps and rubella jabs have no ill effects whatsoever. It's safer to do them at the same time because you would need a few weeks in between each and this cuts down on the time children are un-immunised for, which is particularly important for infants. 

Circumcision was seen as a ""as a hygienic, medical necessity"" for the same reason eating pork and shellfish was banned in the old testament.  If you are a nomadic tribe in a desert environment in a time before sanitation and refrigeration, then these are foods which have a very high risk of killing you.  They circumcised 2000 years ago because you have a much higher risk of infection in this environment if you don't.  People doing it today are doing it because we live in a Judeo-Christian culture and some traditions hang on.

This is *an injection*, it's not abortion, it's not having your head grafted on to another and it's certainly not a intrusive process in any way shape or form. Yes there is a line and it's when you get down to altering human DNA or when you enter into the abortion/castration debate, but this isn't anywhere near that line. This is three deadly viruses that can be killed if everyone looks away for 2 seconds and then takes a lollypop (it's even less painful than having your ears pierced) - The reason we are not all walking around dying of smallpox today or catching polio is because everyone got vaccinated and it killed the diseases. 

Not having the vaccination is teaching our youth ""fuck other humans"" as no, not everyone is able to be immunised, there are people for whom the vaccinations don't work and there are people with compromised immune systems, people with HIV or full blown AIDS, or people undergoing cancer treatment for example.

In France the GP's invoice you, but the costs are covered by a mandatory health insurance system the government operates which is funded by employers and employees. So the treatment isn't free at the point of use, but is covered by socialized costs.

They also face the same problems though, medical treatment is increasingly expensive due to the complexity of modern medicine, and the fact that an aging population expects more treatment than the systems were setup to provide. Things that a generation ago were death sentences can now be treated, although often this requires long term treatment rather than procedures that cure you.

As for under-funding vs mismanagement, it's both. We need to pay more to get the treatment we expect, and the NHS is in dire need of modernization, both in terms of it's internal business processes and the areas it focuses on. Better access to GP's who offer more services would reduce the need for more complex and expensive hospital treatment later on for example.

Surely when it comes to medical issues the fact that it is a small or large procedure has little relevance? We require adults to consent to both minor and major procedures, and we should treat teenagers ability to consent in a uniform manner. 

Being in a medical setting, having a stranger take control over your body can be traumatic for children, it was for me as a child, especially when I was too small to understand what was going on. It can be even more traumatic when you are a teenager and vegan and have some animal-matter forced into you, as she believes is what will happen. 

Forcing teenagers to be subjected to a medical procedure despite their lack of consent, is teaching them that the state is a violent body that can subject them to its control at will and that they don't have rights as citizens, how will they trust in their voting power and in the tax system when they have been primed into lack of agency? If the state is violent why should they contribute in taxes? They will not see it as being for the common good. Educating them on the dangers to others of not having the vaccine  would be a far better solution, I am sure in most cases they would be able to see why they should have the jab. 

Respecting that ones kids right to self-determination of her body in the face of the court, has nothing to do with 'teaching kids that it is ok to disregard other humans', how can it? For it to be so it would have to be the kids making the decision each time themselves. 

As far as I know it is the parents who still make the decisions, teenagers don't make them actively, because most agree with their parents who tell them to have the jab or not. In the cases where they don't have the jab it is also because the parents agreed to that, so at no point it is the kids actually actively making the decision for themselves, they are just going along with what their parents think is best for them, the consent being implicit in the trust given to their parents. 

In this case it is different, because the state comes in and takes control of the kids body without consent, so the state says that it has the right to control families without consent. 

For it to be justified the mother would have had to be declared incompetent as a parent, and this did not take place, therefore the intrusion was unethical. ",0,1381687345,null,0,false,0,ccqwjli,t3_1o93ss,t1_ccqwjli,t1_ccqvoqp,null,1429145039,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

- Websites you access can't tell where you are in the world - they can only see where the 'exit' of this VPN is. If the exit is in the US, it will appear to the website that you're from the US allowing you to watch US Netflix, hulu etc. VPNs with multiple exit points are useful as you can choose where you appear to be in the world.

- Also quite good for anonymity. Your ISP can see that you're connected to Acme VPN Services Ltd, and your destination site can see an incoming connection from Acme VPN Services Ltd, but there is no way of connecting the two (assuming your provider is reputable).
