On the one hand, we've been playing really well and I've been happy with the team for the first time in a long while. On the other hand, Peter Lorimer on commentating alongside Thom Kirwin today. For those of you who don't understand, things generally go bad for Leeds when Lorimer is commentating. In fairness, the match may sound worse than it really is because Lorimer blathers over what's actually happening, but all I can remember is that terrible night away at Swindon when we lost 3-0.

Well, if it's going to go bad then I'll choose to fall on my sword and predict a healthy **2-1 to Leeds**. Hopefully it won't, though, as the positive vibes coming out of Elland Road are outstanding.

Also, for all my bragging about McDermott bringing Morison back into the team, I've changed my mind on that because Thom and Eddie said last night that didn't think that he'd change it, which means Morison may start on the bench. Here's how I predict the team will look:

I was told the idea of the apprenticeships was to get more supervisors &amp; managers trained from within the company as opposed to bringing them in from outside, as Starbucks has 700+ directly operated stores. They're currently thinking about franchising though, so, those smaller operators may choose to get apprentices at the slavishly cheap rate of £2.68 p/h.

But yea, the idea of a certificate in Barista Mastery does sound ridiculous. Perhaps not so much to those who have failed at GCSE level though. They can't call it an apprenticeship without a qualification, no matter how absurd the qualification is.

We also recognise that we live on a fragile planet with limited resources. There is simply never enough to go around, that is the defining principle of economics.

Secondly you mistake quantity for quality. If I as an individual feel that the quality of my air supply is not good enough I (and others) can move away. This in turn will starve the factories (the sources of this pollution) of labour. Over time the air quality can recover. Or I can petition the government to fine said polluters on my behalf, thus putting a price on air quantity. Which is what is done in the developed world.

Yeah, I'm not convinced that there would be a collapse in currency. The banks would certainly throw a snit and refuse to renew domestic lending in order to pressure the government to backtrack by getting the public to demand it but commercial lending would continue otherwise the banks themselves would die.

I imagine other institutions like credit unions, building societies, co-operatives of various kinds would spring up to service the needs and probably there would be a government run business bank/ lender of last resort in there too.

true,whatlad,null,null,"&gt;We as libertarians recognise the failings of the humanity in our assessment of socio-economic orders. We know that humans are lazy, deceitful, power hungry, greedy and sometimes, just plain stupid.

i fundamentally disagree with what you recognise. i believe people are inherently good and their morals have been left to rot by a consumer driven society. just as easily as they have been conditioned in this way, they can be conditioned to value education, cooperation and consideration. ultimately, we are social beings and this idea of competition on a social (not professional) level is artificial and divisive



&gt;We also recognise that we live on a fragile planet with limited resources. There is simply never enough to go around, 

i agree with this, and advocate for a resource based economy (though not in the form of the venus project)



&gt;that is the defining principle of economics. Socialism does not take into account the failings of Human nature nor does it take into account the defining factor of economics. That's why it is a failed system and belief, proven by the mad dictatorships of Stalin and Pol Pot, as well as the food shortages in North Korea. 

socialism has never been properly applied. it's too easy to think power has to be centralised, but marx never conceived of the internet as i said, and i believe now we would have the ability to split authority in failsafe and transparent ways.



&gt;Secondly you mistake quantity for quality. If I as an individual feel that the quality of my air supply is not good enough I (and others) can move away. This in turn will starve the factories (the sources of this pollution) of labour. Over time the air quality can recover. Or I can petition the government to fine said polluters on my behalf, thus putting a price on air quantity. Which is what is done in the developed world.

""I can move away"", oh that easy for you to relocate, is it? Leave your family, roots, pack everything up and drive off to a new place just like that. I think you'll find the majority of people will just stay and suffer. ""well that's their choice"", no it's just circumstance.



&gt;Where is the government going to get the money to fund a hostile take over of an entire country's water distribution network? Especially as raising taxes will kill what little economic prospects we already have.

Not saying any takeover should be hostile, would have to be properly assessed, with public backing and fully transparent. but water is fundamental. i see wanting to profit off basic human rights as immoral.

true,whatlad,null,null,"&gt;We are social beings, but stemming from that we are tribal and we are products of nature. We will act as a society only when it benefits us as individuals. Do you deny, there is competition for power and resources in the natural world? Do you deny the existance of parasites in the natural world who exist off of the back of something else? We were not conditioned this way by consumerism, we as a species are a bunch of pricks of the highest order. Ever since we committed genocide against neanderthals thousands of years ago, we have conformed to Darwin's principle: Survival of the fittest.

I think we've come a long way since then. The average person on the street has more decency than our politicians. At least that's the reality where I live. Of course, we're manipulated and passive, but if we were educated to question rather than to conform, this wouldn't be an issue. It's already becoming not an issue just through internet alone, in spite of our conditioning.

&gt;Secondly, I hear from sypathisers of socialism that ""it has never properly been applied."" Why hasn't it been? 
Because the USA won the cold war, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing given the alternative, but it  meant that State Capitalism became the dominant ideology across the globe.

&gt;Is it, because human character has been incorrectly specified? That some bastard will always rise to power without proper checks, or people will not perform their jobs optimally, because there is no incentive for them to do so?

No, I believe we have the ability to incentivise if we set out to do it properly, and I also believe we have the ability to apply transparency to the system from the ground up so that everyone is accountable. Of course the practicalities of how such an idea would develop are not yet in place, but we're on the drip drip in that direction as society wakes up to the reality of the current paradigm.


&gt;Finally the profit is the incentive for water distributors to do their jobs to the highest standard possible. The majority of the services and goods you enjoy have been brought to you off the sweat from someone's back. Is it wrong for them to profit from their labour?

No, I believe hard work should be rewarded, but ""gaming"" the rewards system should be prevented. manual labour is harder than sitting in offices typing. it might not be smart work, but its hard work. remember that.

&gt;Moving on, you missed my other point, whether this was deliberate I do not know, but you can petition the government to fine the polluters. Thus circumnavigating the issue of circumstance.

true,strolls,null,null,"I don't really see any of this as *meaningful* ways to achieve that kind of ownership or egalitarianism. 

I mean, if we look at the council house sell off, that claimed exactly the same motivation - to achieve a nation of homeowners, so citizens owned their own homes, and had an investment in the country and in being a member of their community and stuff. 

Ultimately, many of those council houses - [40% of them](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/private-landlords-seize-right-to-buy-homes/6526526.article) - have ended up in the hands of private landlords. Home ownership is now lower than when Thatcher left office!

I don't know what this proposal, as per TFA, would do to facilitate share ownership. Right now you can go to UKstockbroker.com and just buy a bunch of shares, and it'll probably cost you less in stockbroker's fees than it ever has done before. 

The proposal for workers to give up certain rights in return for shares (not ""free shares"") every year in your company - well, I used to work for a company that probably earned the boss £5m a year profit; it had maybe 20 employees (it relied heavily on contractors). Let's value that company at £50m for the sake of this argument - if you bought it cash, you'd have paid off your investment in 10 years. So if every employee gets £1000 of shares, after 10 years that's £200,000 of shares in worker ownership, or 0.4% of the company.

I don't know that even 10% of the company in employee ownership is even meaningful, because the boss still gets to make all the decisions - 10% doesn't wield any influence. And this doesn't even consider all the potentials for the boss to have one company with 20 employees who own shares, and to contract from another company which he owns with no employees. So, yeah, what I mostly see there is a way to reduce the rights of workers - effectively they'll be paid the same amount, it'll just be restructured so they get an annual ""bonus"" as share dividends. 

""The means of production"" was a term coined by Marx and, like the entire liberalism movement, it was a response to the king's ""[divine right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract#Overview)"" to rule just because he was born heir to it.

So if we look at my former employer, it's great that he gets £5m a year in profit because he started the company and ventured capital and risk and stuff - his kids, however, will be able to live a life of ease and never have to work a day in their lives. Meanwhile his employees and their children will still be living in ex-council flats in W London and, if they're lucky enough to have retained their shares, after 20 years their investment will return a dividend of £38.46 per week, nothing compared to a traditional pension (not counting the risk of having it stuck in a single company owned by someone else).

Neither are most people, i might also add that neither are you, or you wouldn't be sitting there typing. That's not a defamation of your character, but the fact is you'd rather spend your time and money doing something else, because of greed (and I really do not mean that as an insult).

Secondly the fact I recently saw in the news, that someone murdered his girlfriend to collect her life insurance goes some way to proving my point. I don't deny we can be good as individuals, but as a species we are just a bunch of cretins. 

Thirdly the USA winning the cold war was a result of the failings of socialism. If it was a sound socio-economic theory more countries would of adopted it. At it's height communism was adopted by a collective of oppressed countries under a soviet empire and a few backwards agrarian-based states. Socialism has already been assessed by the people and it has been found wanting.

Addressing your point about gaming the system. No one is gaming the system. The harsh truth is that someone who can sit in an office typing, is more economically valuable than a manual labourer. It's why they are paid more. They may not be as valuable to society, but its the truth you may not want to hear. An office worker has to be literate, numerate, able bodied and be in possession of I.T. and communication skills. A manual labourer has to be able bodied and capable of understanding a single repetitive process. It's why a company C.O. is paid more than me, a student. His skills and knowledge are rarer than mine, thus they are in shorter supply, therefore he is paid more. How 'hard' the work is plays little in deciding economic worth, it's how rare the people are that can do the work which is the deciding factor.

[Tarek El Diwany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeM1wQiJKl8) has done a documentary on the problems of artificially created debt. 

The interest on all the debt cannot be paid off; because 3 per cent of state money is nowhere near enough to finance 97 per cent that is mostly debt. 

In the end, banks will have to forgive a lot of this debt, or the state will have to create new money to finance it. The end results aren't good. 

Debt creation by the banks is fundamentally causing inflation. There have to be corresponding goods that this new money is spent on or it will produce shortages. 

The UK really should be enforcing some kind of reserve requirements on banks. El Diwany and the Austrian School argue that we need a restoration of a gold standard: a 100 per cent reserve (as opposed to fractional reserve) system where every pound is backed up by something it can be directly converted into. 

The risk is that banks are making profits out of thin air because they have the licence to counterfeit money (as Murray Rothbard would put it) - which in the long run causes inflation, cheapening the value of that money and could lead to scenes like those in Greece or Argentina at the end of the last millennium.

Everytime Wigan got the ball there seemed to be the opportunity for Wigan to really break, as long as they moved the ball quickly. Yaya can be very lazy in backtracking, along with Nasri, etc, so I think quickness on the ball is important.

Dembele's ability to surge up the field will be huge, and hopefully Lennon and Bale will be able to do their nice runs as well. Micah Richards looked slow against Wigan, recently coming back from injury, but as this game doesn't mean much for City (unless they truly are still holding onto hopes for a title) I can see him starting again and we should definitely try to test his fitness and confidence. 

But we also saw the City that played against Chelsea...and we are gonna have a harddd time at the back if that attacking force shows up again. Our defenders really have to be on point and not ball watch or fall asleep for a second like they are sometimes prone to do or else Aguero and Tevez will leave them in the dust.

Countries ignore UN laws and resolutions all the time, depending on what they can get away with and what pressure's put on them by other countries. 

So this is an excuse, although there's a little bit of depth to it.

It's similar to how Europe is leading the world in reducing carbon emissions, so that we have the moral high ground when we bitch at China to clean up its act. China says ""our people are poor, we're building another coal power station because they need electricity"" - having burned billions of tonnes of coal ourselves we can't tell them that its bad for the environment without taking steps ourselves to reduce our carbon emissions.

It's convenient for ministers and MPs to be able to tell their more active sensible-drugs-policy campaigners ""we're signatories to UN resolutions, we can't legalise drugs"", it's also because we bully countries like Bolivia and Laos to cut down on their exports of coke and heroin.

If we decriminalise drugs or allow junkies to jack up in a safe manner, it becomes more difficult to harass those exporters - Laos will say ""but you're our biggest market, you're not stopping your citizens from using our heroin, how can you stop us growing it? it's a cash crop, we need the money"". 

Meanwhile, we subsidise opium production in India (or the US, at least, gives India preferential exporter status) because they promise to police their growers and only allow it to be sold it as medically prescribed painkillers. 

Basically politicians have backed themselves into a corner with the whole drugs thing - they can't decriminalise, only completely legalise it, in which case the *Daily Mail* will be all over them.

Well, the pension fund pays a broker (taxed) who buys a security from an exchange (taxed), and hedges some of the currency risk that might be associated with that security with a x-currency swap (taxed, perhaps at every coupon payment). That may also seek to hedge the fund against invest rate shifts, so buy a ir swap (taxed). Etc. etc. 

Money moves around **a lot**, so a transaction tax would tax the same money lots of times. This creates an incentive to move money less often, or to shorten the chain. That would lead to a shallower and less liquid market, which is undesirable as well. There are lots of unintended consequences with a transaction tax, I think.

&gt;unnecessarily affecting the wellbeing and pocket of every single person in the UK aren't doing anything wrong.

Define necessary. People do things which aren't essential to their survival all the time, all these drug companies are doing is what companies naturally do, attempt to make more money from their products or services.

I sometimes think that people forget that drugs cost millions or billions to develop, and that individuals do not have some god given right to help themselves to medicine simply because they're sick.

I remember two days after I moved to my new flat with friends when at university, there was someone stabbed to death nearby, outside of those few people around there, people on the other side of town, or people at uni had no idea about it, and that's just in a town. When I was younger, there were a bunch of people, one of them broke into my house trying to escape from the police, who also had a helicopter searching for them - this, in a pretty small village, most of my friends had no idea anything had gone down, there were police everywhere and in a small village, a helicopter flying so low makes a pretty loud noise.

Of course, I don't expect everything to be reported, but there should be some sort of preference on this, local events of course should be covered locally, and much larger things should be covered on a more widespread scale - I'd argue thousands being affected is a worse situation and deserves more coverage, but the sad truth is it's more sensationalist and more likely to get viewers when you focus so much on Boston instead, because what's another Earthquake in comparison - sadly, it's ""boring"" by comparison, and that may be heartless, but that's what it actually is.

I don't think the question of Welsh independence is realistic at the moment.

It's a shite state of affairs to be in to be honest, but if it makes you feel any better about it the westcountry and the north are in a not entirely dissimilar similar situation.

For what it's worth I'd love an English parliament separate to the GLA. I think London should really be it's own constituent country in the UK rather than part of England as it's not really representative of England and skews (or should that be screws) the rest of England, not just Wales.

The company does not get to just decide which category they employ you under, they have an obligation to decide it based on HMRC's rules and the final decision can be made by a tax inspector on a case by case basis. Basically they have each of the three types of employment (Worker/Employee/Self Employed) and a list of what your responsibilities, expectations and abilities are in those types. Then based on the job they make a decision.

For example, Self Employed people should be supplying their own equipment, should be able to carry out the work whenever they deem fit, should not be subject to disciplinary procedures and should be able to hire a someone else to do the job for them.

If your mate is told when to turn up, told what to do, told when to leave, supplied with equipment and isn't allowed to hire someone else to do the job then he most likely an employee and as an employee is entitled to PAYE/Sick Pay/Paternity Leave/Redundancy Pay and of course, national minimum wage. (Assuming it's not one of these apprenticeships)

[Here is the HMRC page that details it](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/employment-status)

If HMRC find that the company has willingly misled the employee to reduce their obligtions then they fine for back-payment of all taxes + more.

**Lots** of people are conned into thinking they are self employed when they are not, just so companies can skip out of paying tax and ensuring the rights an employee legally has. HMRC has a particular hatred for it because often times these self employed people aren't completely aware of the situation and aren't properly doing self assessment or paying their own NIC.

true,Ardal,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;the report shows that passengers on every franchise were in effect subsidised when money spent on infrastructure was included. However, the net subsidy for East Coast was 1% of the line's income, compared with an average of 32%.



This is the key to the absolute bollox of this article. The 'subsidy' under discussion here is money paid to Network Rail for infrastructure improvement and maintenance. This improvement and maintenance is undertaken in life cycles, following the Hatfield crash and the 'gauge corner cracking' debacle the East Coast line(s) rightfully received a decade of investment. That decade of investment means there is no need to spend much at all on it (relative to previous spending) in the decade following, when this is combined with the fact that the East Coast franchise was the 'Flagship' service of the UK rail network (well used bringing in bags of money) and the fact that many, many other TOC's/FOC's and IMC's use the east coast (and pay to do so ) the comparison between the 'LINE' income and Network rails expenditure on it leaves a very small sum.

BUT - the 'LINE' income is not just from the East Coast franchise. it is from them FCC+ Hull Trains + Grand Central Trains + Freightliner + Fastline + DBS etc. etc. 

This story is total fabrication and those unions spouting how it shows the East coast Franchise is well run and costs less are disingenuous pricks who either intend to mislead the ignorant or who are too fucking stupid for words and genuinely don't understand how the industry they work in actually operates.

I quite like it, as it adds an extra layer of complexity; it's far too easy to just say ""here's a monster, it wants to kill people"", and that can be boring. The clever episodes with memorable monsters tend to add something to that by giving them some extra depth. Obviously it's not the only way (see Blink), but it helps.

That shot in the window was fantastic. But as an episode to be viewed once, I'm not sure the ending takes anything away from that; it was a genuinely scary moment. But having seen the ending, I wonder if rewatching adds an extra emotional layer to scenes like that (and the hand-holding one) because you can understand *why* it's there, and what it wants (it's just as desperate for the Doctor to succeed).

If it had been all Land of Hope and Glory the Americans wouldn't have rebelled, the Indians wouldn't have fought us for independence, half the world would still call themselves imperial subjects. But they did fight us, they did struggle, and they did get their independence because we critically mismanaged our colonies and treated them as trading posts for monopolizing royal charter companies rather than any sort of equal partner in a super-state. The people of the colonies had no representation in parliament and half the time were under the effective rulership of corporations like the East India Company rather than the British Crown. Any good we enacted was to improve the economic prospects, and it sure as hell was nothing to do with being good human beings.

- The Ice Warrior lost 5,000 years in the ice
- Hila could not go back to her own life and she was trapped in a elongated moment of time

I am not sure how this relates to Clara - although I am guessing it does.  Has she been robbed of her life without realising and that is why the TARDIS senses that something is wrong?

Someone on the Guardian also suggested that Clara saw Clara because the TARDIS is aware that there is more than one in existence and it is trying to make her remember.

I have no coherent theory.  I just thought I'd shared what's popped into my head.

The TARDIS talked to Clara!  If I'm not mistaken, that's the first time the TARDIS has actually talked to anybody since ""The Doctor's Wife"".  How can the TARDIS be talking???  Thought the Doctor said it would be impossible.  I feel like this is really big!  


Did Clara pilot the TARDIS, or did the TARDIS take Clara where she wanted to go?  Either way, this is important.  If Clara was able to pilot the TARDIS, how, and who is she that she's able to do so?  If the TARDIS took Clara where she needed to go, why does she help her now when she seems to not like Clara.  And why doesn't the TARDIS like Clara?  It's now established that the TARDIS is like a slow to trust cat, but we haven't seen it give this kind of treatment to a main character since Captain Jack.


Something else I noticed, Emma distrusts the Doctor.  Early on she asks the Professor what he thinks about the Doctor, and he goes on about how men like him are liars. She also tells Clara not to trust the Doctor, that he's got ice in his heart. So at the end of the episode, Emma Grayling asks the Doctor what he was really doing there, and he asks Emma to tell him about Clara.  I think Emma lied.  It's been established throughout the episode that she distrusts the Doctor, so if she knew something about Clara, she wasn't going to say.

There's a report [here](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmadmin/560/56007.htm) but I am not in the mood to read it.

&gt; 10,000 people work on the parliamentary estate, plus visitors (and a tourist cafe). That would have to be a massive bloody single canteen.

There doesn't need to be several separate dining areas plus an MP's only area.

Oh, and don't forget that Parliament is in the middle of London, it isn't as if there aren't numerous places to eat within even walking distance (I counted several when I was there). It's not like every single person needs Parliamentary facilities.

My employer is situated in an out of town business park where getting the bus into town would take about 20 minutes round trip). It rather needs its barely subsidised canteen.

&gt; The food in parliament isn't generally fine dining, it's mostly pretty standard canteen fare in pretty standard canteens. There are a couple of seated restaurants for MPs / Lords, but as Parliament sits in the evenings and parliamentarians have to stick around to vote, I don't really see the problem with them being able to entertain people there.

The menus that I posted in another comment seem pretty high quality stuff, certainly more than my employer gives me - it's several courses too. I guess we can differ on the definition of fine dining but the items on the menu plus the availability of wines etc suggests to me it's better than 99.9% of employers' canteens. It's interesting how the same food is in both menus yet the Members' dining area (which is exclusively MPs only, as I understand) is about half the price. 

Seems like a large subsidy for a group of people who have a significant salary - again, a lot more than almost everyone who works with me.

It's the same argument again - can people not be entertained at either closer to market rate or in the numerous bars and restaurants in Central London?

&gt; Plenty of work places do have clubs where workers can drink, eg police social clubs. But I wouldn't be bothered if these were removed, personally. I think the age of pissed up MPs has largely gone, give or take the odd thuggish prick, so I don't think that it would make much difference to the MPs.

Don't social clubs often rely on memberships and sales to stay afloat? I doubt the police forces spend millions subsidising social clubs.",0,1366491438,null,0,false,0,c9j9881,t3_1cql1x,t1_c9j9881,t1_c9j867h,null,1431487308,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; And the smoking thing is complete bunkum. Although the parliamentary estate is technically not covered by the smoking ban (like all royal palaces), they have chosen to abide by the rules. Smoking indoors is banned completely, and smoking outdoors is banned but for four designated smoking points. There are no smoking rooms.

158. The Smoking Room provides a bar that Members alone may use at present. Takings are small. **The cost of staffing the bar more than outweighs the revenue raised.** Average covers served in the room, which opens from 3 pm until after 10 pm on Monday to Wednesday, and earlier on Thursday, were, in October to December, 2010, some 36 on Mondays, 42 on Tuesdays, 26 on Wednesdays and only 5 on Thursdays.[105] 

Is the ""smoking room"" a hangover from the days before the ban? They obviously still call it that, regardless of what its purpose is. I thought the highlighted bit was interesting too.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"I'm with this totally, Wakefield has been proven as a fraud. However in some cases fear of science has been justified.

First of all, if the mmr jabs is based on the Urabe mumps strain, there is a risk of contracting meningitis (but ok, that risk is still there from measles)

There was a contamination of SV40 in a polio vaccine leading to many people contracting cancer. This went on for 6 years and I recently entered into a debate with someone who was affected.

So while most fears are baseless, pharmaceutical companies (I use this term rather than ""scientists"" because they're profit making companies first, scientists second), they have made mistakes.

Then of course we have that wonderful media. Some headlines taken from one single paper (Brits will be able to name it!) in a search for ""mmr"":

* Six months after the MMR jab... a bubbly little girl now struggles to speak, walk and feed herself
* The research that 'disproves MMR jab link to autism'
* The anti-MMR mothers who are putting us all in danger
* New evidence 'shows MMR link to autism'
* U.S. court rules MMR vaccine is NOT linked to autism
* American parents awarded £600,000 in compensation after their son developed autism as a result of MMR vaccine
* Government dismisses claim by disgraced MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield that health officials are responsible for measles outbreak
* After MMR, how can we believe this new child vaccine is safe?
* Family win 18-year-fight over MMR damage to son: £90,000 payout is first since concerns over vaccine surfaced
* MMR - the warnings ignored
* No autism link to MMR jab
* MMR - risk of brain disorders?
* MMR row doctor 'paid children £5 for blood samples at son's birthday party'
* New MMR link found to autism
* How the middle-class MMR refuseniks are putting every child at risk

I've no doubt local media in Iraq weight things differently.
News has more or less meaning to us depending on how much or how little we perceive it to affect us.
To say no-one gives a shit is unfair, and it did get coverage. People give a shit or we wouldn't even be talking about it. 

Whether something is newsworthy comes down to how expected the event is.
Bombs in Iraq? Not unexpected, many have gone off in recent years.
Bombs in America? Totally unexpected. 

This is partly due to the security situations in each country. In a country that has no security, bombings sadly happen much more easily. In a secure country, a bomb going off represents a failure of some kind, it is not over-dramatic to be shocked by that.

That is what the media is all about. If you don't like it, don't buy into it. Or start your own outlet. 

I think it is unfair to blame people for worry about their safety first and others second. The fact of the matter is, that story was on the same page, just smaller.

For the longest time, my family had no idea what the strange robot was on the D page...""droid"" sounded a bit cheap and Star Wars-y...and just not right for the general flavor of the book.  Nor did we have any clue who the odd man with funny hat standing behind the weird robot was.

Then a few years ago, it just struck me one day, I ran and grabbed the book (still on my shelf, of course), and there they were, the Dalek and the Doctor.

I would strongly recommend that everyone pick up a copy. It is well worth the price that Amazon is currently charging for it (and well worth even double or triple that price, honestly), even for adults.

So after I was clothed we went for a curry and many drinks. The next morning I go for breakfast in the hotel and people recognise me as the fella who stripped.

1. They have a history which they cling onto as comfort for them being not very good, whilst we don't have as much history as them, but in the recent years, we have destroyed them and our future looks brighter you could say. Therefore, they sing to us (a cover of 'carefree', ""fuck off, chelsea FC, you aint got no history) to which we call them scouse poverty stricken scum bags, even though a lot of our fans are probably just as well of financially (well, tradition would dictate, research the shed end and the ska movement, i don't have time to write it all out)

2. The Champions League rivalry and chelsea vs. liverpool occurring in the calendar many times. We once played them five times in a season, with each game being a heated affair.

3. the Semi final in which the crowd scored the goal that never was. We felt hard done by, whilst they gloated and effectively called us shit which poured fire on the flames. 

4. Rafa benitez is a cunt and Mou is Chelsea eternal her figure, in line with Osgood, Lampard and Tambling. You've heard what he's said.

5. They blamed Heysel on us, well tried to before everyone had common sense and realised it was the bin dippers themselves that killed the Juve fans. 

6. Most of us here in London think they are a bunch of sanctimonious pricks who only recognise the wrong they have done in order to position themselves favourably in the eye of the media, and bleat on about the positives, the culture and the history, which is boring.

3. Steven Gerrard vs. Lampard. Rivalry for the position in the midfield for England. everyone said they can't play together, sparking the really who is the better player debates. Liverpool fans in the Gerrard Camp, Chelsea fans in the Lampard Camp. Plus always talked about on the raadio, reinforcing Chelsea fans fighting with scouse scum in public. 

4. Steven Gerrard vs. John Terry: the whole captaincy issue. Rio also tried to get involved but he's thick as fuck

5. Steven Gerrard himself is  terrible bully of a person portrayed as a darling in the media. He has a great PR team for all the bad aspects of his life. 

6. I've seen liverpool fans throw shit down onto other fans and cover other fans cars in piss. Grimy.


There is a lot more, so people can add to this also, as I have abbreviated because I am tired. and this is only the viewpoint of a Chelsea fan. Liverpool will have a completely different view.

I concede to the fact that her lack of memory was due to the cracks. They do not concretely say this in season 5 or throughout season 5 of confidential. It is only said by the doctor that if something is consumed by the cracks it is wiped from all time and space, not that that is the definite reason Amy can't remember. The reason I believed this wasn't why she didn't remember is that I couldn't remember anybody else forgetting the Daleks except her. In the last couple episodes they mention that Rory couldn't remember them either.

The theory that the cracks in the wall wiped it from their memories is still open for interpretation. If the Daleks were wiped from Amy's mind in S5E3 then how were the Daleks A) even in that episode and B) how did they show up at the opening of the Pandorica. Moffat had stated in the confidential episode for the opening of the pandorica that the Doctor isn't playing by the rules this week, as seen by the excessive vortex manipulator use. I imagine the writers thought the loose rules for the Doctor applied to the rest of the script for the season.

On the topic of Amy being a flesh avatar in season 5, this is extremely complex taking theories of how the the TARDIS exploded into account and not knowing how the Silence will end.

Start with a couple facts, or as close to facts as you can get with the Doctor.

1) The Doctor lies. This doesn't really come into play here, but never forget!

2) River was conceived on the TARDIS in the gap between S5 and the following christmas special. I choose to believe it's why they were in cosplay during the christmas special.

3) River knows about all of the events in season 6 right from when we meet her in season 5 episode 1.

4)Time is not a straight line of cause and effect. It's more like a big ball of timey-wimey stuff.
 
Now knowing all of that we can start speculating on when Amy was swapped for Flesh Amy.

A lot of people believe that a Silence was on the TARDIS and made it fly off with River in it, in another attempt to stop the Doctor from asking the first question. If this is the case, how is it unlikely they would have brought the flesh Amy back in time and snuck her on the TARDIS?

I haven't really done much speculation on the exact point Amy was taken away, but my gut tell me that Flesh Amy was with the doctor in Season 5. This resulted in why she wasn't given a key, the Doctor is very intuitive as we're seeing even more with Clara, and helps tie up some loose ends with the Silence. This still leaves how she copulates with Rory open.

When the Pandorica exploded using the power of the already exploding TARDIS, time wasn't just restored it was all re-written by extrapolating the whole of creation from a few particles inside the pandorica. This makes it almost identical but I'm sure there will be some things off. I believe that during this reboot the Flesh Amy we saw in season 5 was terminated and the real Amy came back. Then season 6 proceeds.

Keep in mind we haven't seen the last of the Silence and so we don't know how the writer's will actually tie this all up with a copious amount of intangible red tape. What I was referring to when I recommended that Dilliedo re-watch Doctor who, it was so that he can see how these things don't get weaved together in one season and that we don't get to know the real definite answer. I realize I phrased it a bit rudely and apologize in hindsight. I just really had to get back to work and wanted to finish the post. This one might shed some light on the fact that I didn't.

EDIT: Home from work, on the topic of the Silence. They did play a role in season 5 episode 11 albeit a small role. The spaceship on top of Craig's house is infact an abandoned Silence spaceship.

BHAA!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XRLgNlchU4#t=1m22s) And, yeah, the cookies are there purely because of the show.

But honestly, I don't drink tea because it's ""British"". I drink it because I like it. I first tried it years ago. And yes, I did so after reading an essay by Douglas Adams—not because it was ""British-y""—but because his [description](http://www.h2g2.com/approved_entry/A61345) made it sound so wonderful.

Then, again, I first tried Bach in that same period after reading a [different essay](http://books.google.com/books?id=DpIwyu_ZW9AC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) in the same book, and that one has stuck, too. And I don't think anybody could accuse my enjoyment of the music of an old, dead, German Lutheran of being a fetishization of British culture.

Later, when I reached the legal drinking age, it was probably his constant references to gin and tonic that caused me to try that drink.

And it was due to the fact that I knew about his historical involvement with the show that I first tried *Doctor Who*.

All of those things speak more to the influence of Douglas Adams on me at a point in life where his work seems so capable of capturing and shaping a young, impressionable person's mind.

You could probably do this for several other authors, as well—likely for all those who were my favorites during the time when I was forming my personality and figuring out who I was.

Thank god I didn't read any [Ayn Rand at that point, and instead opted for Tolkien.](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/366635-there-are-two-novels-that-can-change-a-bookish-fourteen-year)

Edit: HOLY SHIT AND THE LEAF WAS RED double edit: Unless that's the theme... triple edit. Sorry. But maybe her red is to counter the Doctor's blue? Quadruple edit, Clara Oswin Oswald, In hexadecimal, C00. It's the color red. I don't know if i'm finding stuff out or if there is some major coincidences... quint edit: the hex code is c zero zero, her initials are COO. I was making the logical leap that the letter O is the same as zero. hexedit: So another thread just mentioned an anagram of her name is a window across all. This may be just gibberish, but I'm also thinking that perhaps Clara is another type of Time Lord. One that doesn't Phoenix regenerate, but actually dies, and then is actually born again. She may also be able to go into parallel universes due to this(somehow). This most recent episode, the Doctor says the Tardis could only survive for a small amount of time before bad stuff happens. With Clara, it seemed that the Tardis was cool with doing it, and it seemed to me that the Tardis lasted much longer than the Doctor said it could. We assume that the Tardis agrees because the Tardis loves the Doctor and wants to save him (which is true) but what if the real reason was that the Tardis realized that Clara LETS the Tardis move across universes... We were given no proof that that window had to be open for the Tardis to go into the pocket universe, just circumstantial evidence that the portal was open when the Tardis was rescuing the Doctor.

It works because the episode never lets you get a very good look at it, only showing flashes with lightning, or with that weird sort of stilty marionette stop-motion jerky movement, which only serves to amp up the creepy factor.

[BIG SPOILER](#s ""Clara isn't the impossible girl, she is entirely possible. The Doctor is lured to Tenzalore, which is where his grave is located. The Great Intelligence kidnaps and threatens his friends (the peeps from the christmas special) in order to get the doctor to open the tomb (which is the tardis) The doctor doesn't relent, but River does, she was there when the doctor revealed his true name. The doors open, everyone walks in to see a web of white light. The white light is the doctor, as a body is... Cliche. It is a web of all of the doctor's timelines, everytime he transported in time and space a new strand was created. The Great Intelligence enters into the web and begins to kill the doctor, over a million timelines, and reverting any victory the doctor made, which also kills the Great Intelligence (he has to die in every timeline at some point in time. The universe begins to disappear and the doctor begins to die. To save him, Clara jumps into the Doctor's timeline and saves him over a million times (The dalek asylum, the christmas special, all times Clara saves the doctor) but she too has to die in the process, and dies over a million times. The doctor is saved, time reverted, Clara is dead, but not entirely. The Doctor enters into his own timeline to save her. The Clara the doctor meets in present time is the genuine article, the original.

However we do call some biscuits cookies, either because it's becoming more common (I can only assume because of the US television media in every household) or because some biscuits, like the softer chocolate chip kind, are cookies. 

Amusingly, the largest manufacturer of ""cookies"" in the US is Nabisco which was originally known as the National Biscuit Company before shortening the name.

I feel there are two main factors for the scare.  Wakefield lit the fuse, but there are plenty of good Lancet articles that don't become infused in the national conscience. . 

Firstly, the media, churning out cheap, misinformed, sensational tat. If I as a doctor had misled a patient to this extent, I would rightfully risk my license, why has no punishment been exacted onto the Newspapers? I propose enforced free full page health promotion ads for 5 years?! Why is there no quality science reporting? Other than a sudden development of a professional ethical code in the Newspapers I cannot see this improving any time soon!

Secondly, and even more difficult to treat, is the 'conspiracy theory' mentality of the human mind. We are all ever so slightly suspicious of the establishment  and we all love our kids and thankfully we do not see the diseases that vaccination treats and so they don't exist.  So there will always be superstition/suspicion of vaccination. It probably is expected human nature.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; I believe that the spiraling cost is mainly due to the removal of any sort of rent control and the growth of the buy to let market.

Of course. That was predicted before the council houses sell-off started. Some cynics even suggested back in the 80s that that was the long term plan - to shift ownership of properties to a few wealthy landlords, thus reducing competition in the rental market and making the rich richer while the poor get poorer, thereby keeping Tory voters happy.

The idea of making everyone a home-owner is all very nice but absurdly naive. Of course there are many reasons why those homes will be sold at some time or another, and why relatively wealthy people will be more able to buy them than anyone else. If nothing else, that's a nice financial windfall that may be more usefully spent on something else. Those who bought their own council house got a nice gain, but they could only cash in on it once.

Obviously those homes inevitably flowed into the private rental market, where private landlords can cash in on them a bit more every month.

Extra bonus - the housing benefits rules seem to include council and housing association rents in their assessment of ""market rents"" and maybe other unavailable rents, in their determination of the average rent. Pretty much everyone in private renting has to pay a rent top-up because housing benefit judges that the landlord could not charge that rent to tenants who aren't on housing benefits, even though the landlords do exactly that. My rent hasn't increase since 2006 IIRC, and was below the average market rent for a one-bedroom flat in this area even then, yet for most of that time I've had to pay a top-up in the order of £100 a month. Switching to LHA reduced that, but apparently this situation won't last. Basically, tenants have no choice but private rental (I've been trying to get a council flat for years - I've not even been in the ""first 20"") and are punished by the government because landlords do what government has specifically enabled them to do - get rich at the expense of the poor by charging high rents.

Possibilities

1. We don't get the name. Smart choice, but calling an episode ""The Name of the Doctor"" and not giving the name is kind of silly.

2. It's metaphorical. His name is the oncoming storm or something like that. Somewhat likely.

3. He's some ancient Time Lord of myth from the old series, like Rassilon. Given that it's Moffat, entirely plausible, given Moffat.

4. He actually is named ""Doctor Who"", or some variant thereof. Unlikely, but the rage would be *amazing*. 

5. It's something embarassing/mundane, like Steve. I do notice a trend lately of the Doctor being incompetent, so maybe.

The second Moffat took over however, it was immediately apparent that the depth and meaning had been lost.

true,absrd,null,null,"When the show first came back, I assumed that ""Time Lock"" meant that the activities of Gallifrey, Skaro, and all other time travelling species who were party to the Time War had been excised from the accessible history of the Universe. Otherwise, what's the difference between Eleven running into Four and Romana punting the Thames and interacting with them during the events of Genesis of the Daleks, thereby materially affecting the outcome of the war? How can a non-linear war be over unless the comprising events are no longer in flux?

In the 2005 series, Jabe of Cheem remarked that the effects of the war were imperceptible to civilisations that lacked time travel technology. The implication was that such civilisations perceived a consistent history. I believe that the vast majority of people would have such a perception not because they were lacking information (i.e. mass amnesia), but because history was *actually* and materially consistent, and that elements like the Doctor, the Master, the Nestene Consciousness, the Gelth, were anomalies in the new timeline.

Regarding the latter two, the Nestene Consciousness was said to have lost its food planets and the Gelth apparently had their bodies destroyed. This makes sense if-- like the Doctor-- they physically *came* from the Time War version of events and had passed into the post Time Lock Universe.

Advanced entities like the human Time Agents of the 50th Century, the Sontarans, and the Forests of Cheem, were apparently aware of the changes to the timeline. Jack Harkness remarked that the Daleks had ""disappeared"", but this speaks only to the notion that Time Agents remembered both versions of history. Another instance of this phenomenon is Amy Pond remembering a childhood with her parents and a childhood in which she ended up as a kiss-o-gram. Even though she remembered the version of events where her parents were absent, she couldn't hop in the TARDIS and *access* those events. Likewise, if there was an actual moment that Jack Harkness perceived the disappearance of the Daleks, I don't think that he could jump back a minute and relive the disappearance; they just wouldn't be there. 

I know that Moffat has back pedalled from this, most notably in Time Crash. I suppose it could be argued that the interaction between Five and Ten took place within the TARDIS, which is its own, isolated system. But I think the real answer is that Moffat will always sacrifice these details in the service of storytelling, and/or will explain later.

Unfortunately, that's a low bar to clear at this point and the episode suffers from the same problem we've seen in virtually every other script this season: Strong concept, intriguing opening, fantastic production values... and an ending that falls flat and doesn't make much sense.

You can pinpoint the moment where the episode goes off the rails pretty much precisely to the moment that the cloister bell sounds. (Well, technically to the moment when the Doctor takes off the harness.) Up until that point they'd established a set of rules and stuck to them. (Although if you look back at certain points they don't make a lot of sense once you know what's actually going on.) After that point, however, they start breaking the rules they've established and everyone starts yelling very loudly in the hope that you won't notice that the writer didn't actually have an ending.

The ""love story"" tag almost solves the lack of a proper ending, but only by doubling down on the painful stupidity which plagues the rest of the last act: Don't set up a rule saying that the TARDIS definitely, absolutely, positively cannot solve this problem; have the TARDIS itself reiterate this fact; and then just say ""fuck it"" and have that be the solution anyway without any explanation or justification. Don't set up the psychic's effort as a major sacrifice and then treat it as a punchline.

Then I went to Reddit meetups and remembered that I am actually very social given people I can actually relate to, or at least who appreciate that not everyone is normal.

So the question I have for you is - are you a sociable person? Do you know how to talk to people and make friends?

If so then all you need to do is create opportunities to meet people. That's really not that hard these days. Hobbies are a good starting point for making friends and networking. I know various wargamers for example. We have that in common and things branch out from there. I like meeting people from the 'net too as it tends to mean there's at least a basic filter for intelligence - they were smart enough to use Reddit for example!

However, I would encourage you to try new things if you can! For instance, which part of scouting is it that interests you the most? Is it working with young people? Volunteering? Camping? Hiking? There are focussed groups for all of those things all over the country which would be a great way to meet new people since you already have experience doing those things to start off with!

In the end, you can spend too much of your life worrying about will I have friends/will anyone care about me, but the real truth is that if you do interesting things, you will inevitably meet interesting people and that is how friendships are born.

Also, we don't really bring religion into our politics. To put it bluntly, nobody over here gives a fuck that you're an atheist, but nobody would give a fuck if you were a Christian either. Religion isn't really something we talk about.

There are no major political parties that are openly anti-choice (though I'm sure there's a better term for it than that) or against free at the point of delivery healthcare. The closest we come is the Conservative Party, which is currently in favour of privatising some parts of the NHS, though healthcare is still covered by National Insurance (NI, in case you didn't know, being the tax we pay for healthcare and the state pension; in reality, of course, all taxes just go into one giant pot). Outright saying they want to abolish the NHS would be considered political suicide.

Because they are not so divisive, issues like healthcare and abortion aren't considered the big issues upon which most British people base their voting choices. You might consider something like immigration policies, spending on other public services like infrastructure, state benefits like unemployment and disability benefits, position on the EU and other foreign policies, and education policies, to name but a few.

You probably wouldn't vote Conservative or anything right of them, but you might vote for any of the other big parties.

As for news organisations that share your view, the differences between ours are less marked than yours. The premier news organisation in the UK is the BBC, which, by and large, remains neutral. You would probably want to avoid something like the Daily Mail, Express, or any of the other tabloids, they're the closest we have to something like Fox News. For better quality newspapers, most lean towards the left, with the Times being furthest towards the right.

The Master went evil because of what his own people did to him...I know, I know, it's a bit of a retcon, but still, you need to remember that it's the constant sound of those drums that was driving him mad. And of course no one knew how to cure it because no one knew who created it...until the end of time itself, which, surprise surprise, were the Time Lords themselves. And at that point, it was their lifeline out of the Time-Lock, which for the price of one of their own, they were not going to give up. But then, it was their willingness to so easily sacrifice one of their own that doomed them...that they so easily wrote off the Master as a tool for their own ends...I mean, they had found a way out of the Time-Lock, but rather than come out with hat in hand, and recognize the frail position they were in, they came out like they were somehow winning a great war, when in fact they were completing another atrocity. At any point the Time-Lords could have paused to reassess their situation, to rethink their direction; instead they rode off like conquerors, high on euphemism and enthusiasm. They found out what was ailing the Master...it was them! And they saw him as a thing. Didn't even pause to cure him...which the Doctor, even in those dark moments, will still attempting to fix. The Master was the ash tree that was offered as a sacrifice to the god of time in return for the safe passage of the Time-Lords, and he became the handle of the axe to cut them down. The Doctor, for all his lies and deceits, manages to stay alive because the road to hell may be paved with good intentions, but the people whose good intentions that pave that road are found in a better place; the Universe, at least the Doctor's Universe, is unwilling to convict him without proven intent of evil on his part; no evil intent, no conviction. 

And in so far the Master was driven insane by his own people...well, perhaps there's a reason he gets to keep coming back, despite all the apparent evil done by him. The Universe disagrees that it was his intent.

Both are pretty good books. The former gives a fantastic account of the grease and graft behind the glitz and glamour in the F1 paddock, and shows how one can go from day-to-day mechanic in a garage in the UK to being a mechanic or engineer in a championship winning F1 team.

Force sensitive individuals are really, really, really rare. 

&gt;The Star Wars Rules Companion claims ""There are trillions of beings in the galaxy, yet the number of beings with any ability in the Force is perhaps in the hundreds. The number of potential or latent users of Force powers is perhaps 10 times as large."" That number is from the time of the Empire, after the Emperor's agents have purged most Force-sensitives from the galaxy; other timeframes have more.

If we are optimistic and say there are ten thousand force sensitive people in the empire's time, with a population of three trillion (which is a low figure). That means that one in three hundred million was force sensitive. For a planet like Earth that means there are 23 latent force sensitives, and 2 actual force users. 

The empire was hunting down anyone that showed signs of the force. This meant that anyone wanting to research it was automatically a target, and they couldn't find a force sensitive individual to test anyway. Those two force users on Earth wouldn't exactly be broadcasting their ability. 

All force sensitive individuals were indoctrinated into the order (at least initially). It isn't that far fetched that the order had a policy of not allowing outsiders to study them. During the empires reign force users were recruited and once again separated from the general population. 

The Jedi had been around for millennia and made sure all force related knowledge was kept within the order, they didn't want to deal with any new age sith. So they kept all their information away from the public, in the jedi library, which leads to the next point.

The Jedi library was destroyed. This was the central repository for all force related knowledge, so it's destruction was probably a big deal.

So you end up with a situation where the leading experts on a subject have been killed, their written information has been destroyed, the government of the time is killing/kidnapping anyone that shows too much interest in the subject and getting test subjects is pretty difficult. 

Your average person on the street certainly isn't going to knowledge about the force after all that.

Think about something like mathematics, the whole study 'stands on the shoulder of giants', you remove those giants and we are back to 1+1 stuff. Think about how good someone would be at maths if they were never educated. They would be able to add and subtract, and have an innate sense of multiplication and division, but beyond that not much. 

For the force, the add and subtract is the internal stuff that you wouldn't notice. The most innately gifted force user ever (Anakin) only displayed increased reflexes before he was trained. So your average force sensitive wouldn't be floating cubes or doing mind tricks, they would just be a high jumper or a fast runner.

true,davidsmeaton,lfc68,,"... and finally, when Suarez was 6 years old he kicked a cat for no reason. In conclusion, that's why Suarez shouldn't be given PFA player of the year.

what a dick!

Let's put this in perspective.

1. Handball vs Ghana - that was in 2010. It wasn't this footballing year and it wasn't under FA jurisdiction. 2 reasons why it's completely irrelevant.

2. Racism vs Evra - that was in 2011. Still not this footballing year, despite the fact that there was no evidence that Suarez intended to be racist against Evra.

3. Suarez punching Java (not mentioned) - This footballing season. Not under FA jurisdiction. Will be dealt with by appropriate governing body.

4. Diving - well, how many cards has he been given for diving? Now compare that number to the other short-listed players.

So, of the 4 things that could be used against Suarez, 2 of them aren't FA's responsibility, 2 of them aren't this season. 2 are unfounded and unproven, despite Suarez being punished for ""racism"".

This is just hate mongering. If you want a reason to hate Suarez, just say that you hate him. Stop making up ""evidence"" to prove that Suarez is a bad guy and justifying your overt bias against the man.

The Angels Take Manhattan: Rory and Amy and some other guys.

The Snowmen: Oswin.

The Bells of Saint John: Lots of people lose their memory, one to the point of thinking she's a child (sort of like dying, at least terrifying consequences). Not to mention people actually dying because they've been in there too long.

Akhaten: Don't remember... think no one?

Cold War: Several soldiers, not just one.

Hide: Haven't seen yet.

Paper 2 is source-based, so you're essentially analysing sources for topics about Britain from 1890-1918 (Suffragettes, WWI and Liberal reforms). I'm doing that in June. The Controlled Assessment is on a topic of your school's choice, but we did Civil Rights in the US. It's a 2,000 essay in about 20 hours, which is plenty of time. 

I'm doing German with AQA, and it's been pretty easy for me. I've finished all speaking and writing assessments, and got an average of 29/30 in all of them, which is a solid A*. It depends on how good you are in German, the way you should revise. If, like me, you've got a bit of a flair for it, learn the grammar and the vocabulary will follow. If you struggle, learn set phrases like ""Ich interessiere mich fuer"" and that'll get you your C or above. 

GCSEs do have a bigger workload than year 9, but in terms of exams it's not too bad. The biggest issue is getting behind in coursework in subjects like DT, because although the work's relatively easy, it's laborious and dull. Once you get behind, the inertia to catch up grows and grows until deadline day, and then you're in a spot of bother.

That said, it might be worth making some enquiries with Santander in the UK, to see if they have a charge transferring between the UK and ES sections of the group. They're likely to be your best bet at avoiding charges.

Outside of Santander, the best way of minimising charges is to transfer the money in larger amounts, although you may flag up some AML hits if you're just below your chosen bank's limits each time. You'll also want use an online international transfer, to save on call charges. 0844s from Spain are going to get expensive, quickly.

Natwest (and by extension, the rest of the RBS group) have international transfers built into their online banking system. The only caveat here is that you might need to do the first transfer in-branch, which I had to do with setting up the transfer for the wife's student loan in the Netherlands, so it might be a little difficult. Although, having just checked my online banking, I can make a transfer to Spain without needing to do it in branch first.

Hopefully that lot will help, but gimme a shout if anything's confusing.

The problem is that the union is not close enough. Nor is satisfying the rules a guarantee of future compatability. There are deep structural issues which are fundamental to the Eurozone. There's considerable imbalance.

Finally it is horribly slow to react to problems, vulnerable to electoral reactions in certain countries (i.e ministers will temporarily act to appease the electorate to avoid political fallout at the cost of economic damage to other countries).

Like in 30 rock when Jack states that children should always be named after the Kings and Queens of England if their parents want them to be respected as adults. If someone said that sincerely in real life I'd back away but in a comedy show it's golden. 
 
And I don't mind when it's born of a genuine interest of British culture and history, I really enjoy Russian literature so I don't see the issue with a Yank being drawn to British literature. 

What I object to is when they present an image of British life that isn't recognisable to me. I don't mind if some uneducated soul in the Congo thinks that the UK is Manchester United and James Bond, but a English speaking Yank with access to intl. media should know better. 
I don't mind ever so much if there's an element of twee stereotyping, because y'know we do drink tea, we do have a Queen etc. But when England is presented as a conservative rural idyll where everyone's white and Christian and there's no crime and we're Republican Narnia... that I strongly object to. 

And it's not just an American thing..

true,Destructi0n,null,null,"It won't be an actual incense, sounds as if it's a dirty synthetic. Here's a review I found.

&gt;Joined tonight just to give a rundown of Clockwork Orange.
&gt;Hello :)
&gt;
&gt;Purchased 12.5 g's today to give it a go. Was under the impression it was a Spice alternative - more the fool me
&gt;
&gt;Male, 40+, physically fit, not regular toker these days of anything.
&gt;
&gt;Bonged about &lt; .1 in about 3-4 sucks.
&gt;
&gt;Seconds later I found myself saying literally saying ""Oh no, this is not where I want to be going in my head "" as a salvia type rush hit me hard. It was the same dread-feeling of a large dose of salvia that had put me off that for the rest of my life years ago and vowed to avoid it. 
&gt;Within a space of 30 seconds I was struggling to get up from the chair and knew I had to reach my bed. Once gingerly on the bed that's when the immense and intense hardcore mass confusion hit me. I was holding my head, swirling and gyrating my body on the bed flat out, begging it to stop, I next slid down off the bed onto my knees still holding my head and struggling, without hope in hell, to get some sanity into me - to get a grip... no chance !
&gt;I tried to grasp onto any thoughts of paranoia which wanted to creep in but I shut it out - mostly because I've lived where I have for a long time and feel subconsciously it is secure and that helped I guess. Besides, the utter overwhelming confusion and physical unsteadyness of now standing on my feet was more than enough to take my concentration. It was a non-stop slaughter of my brain. If someone had walked in I would have been condemned to a nuthouse, seriously. I found myself standing up, not knowing if I had locked my front door downstairs or not and not having the ability to go and check.
&gt;
&gt;After what felt like a hour I got myself together to do all the checks of anything that would have got me back out of bed. It was a herculean effort to get myself settled down - but I was far from alright - just years of experiencing being trollied helped me get my act together and get myself in the safest place - bed, where the intense confusion continued. It was like a game of chess going on in my brain, so completely unsettled and wired. All throughout this my heart was racing, heart attack speed.
&gt;This stuff could put someone over the edge and never come back. It was a fine line into real permanent insanity. 
&gt;
&gt;No couchlock, no nice buzz, no warm feeling, no euphoria just a nasty ride.
&gt;
&gt;After about 2 hours of hell I must have fell asleep - thanks allah, buddha, krishna, mohammed !. 4 hours later I am awake, feeling fine and typing this. Not drained, no confusion just pretty p'eed off it wasn't like spice or the real deal ! Also feeling a tiny bit stupid for being a little too hasty !
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As mentioned, this is nothing like Spice but it loosely reminded me of Yucatan Gold (reminded me of kratom/salvia) . It's more a big dose of salvia with tonnes of bolted on caffeine. The kind of trip where salvia makes you feel you are being man-handled and stuffed into a tiny square of anti-matter but with this stuff it felt more conscious continually of what was going on (just) and it does not pass as quick by a long shot. It was relentless. No doubt the dosage was too big because it caught me unaware but I used a tiny amount, a tiny pinch.
&gt;
&gt;Used to like Spice, they banned that, now they make terrible stuff like this as a loophole which is not good for me that's for certain!. Legallising is the only way to go for harm prevention absolutely.
&gt;
&gt;To sum up - jesus christ is was bloody horrible crossed with terrifying at times... thought I had lost the plot permanently. Won't be using it in a hurry anytime soon.
&gt;
&gt;This will be banned I can tell you that for free ! ouch.
&gt;
&gt;Please excuse grammar / spelling but I think you get the drift
&gt;
&gt;regs
&gt;all and be safe
&gt;M

So guessing it's the usual story of kids not really knowing what it was, how much is ""safe"" to take and thinking it'll be OK because its Legal, for the moment anyway.",0,1366553305,null,0,false,0,c9jm8b6,t3_1csrds,t1_c9jm8b6,t1_c9jm2j6,null,1431481038,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"We have heard literally NOTHING from Bale himself or his agent; all of the speculation he will leave is based on 2 things; 1) Bale, in an interview last year, said that he would like the chance to play in Europe at some point in his career; note, that the question was ""Given the opportunity, would you want to play for a club like Real Madrid?"" - And his answer was something along the lines of ""I mean, of course, I think every player wants to test himself against the best at some point in his career, and it would be a huge opportunity to play for any of the big clubs; Real, Barcelona, Bayern.""

So basically, a reporter asked him if he would enjoy playing at Real Madrid, and he gave a fair answer. But nowhere in there did he say ""I want to leave Tottenham."" or ""I can't wait to move to Madrid/Munich""

simply that those clubs are massive and it's obviously a huge opportunity.

The other side is that Real Madrid &amp; Bayern especially have expressed enormous interest in Bale, with both organizations declaring their intent to buy him.

But remember the Modric saga? that was with a Player who said ""I want out, here's my transfer request."" I can't see Bale handing in a transfer request, not with a daughter who won't even be a year old when next year starts, and not with (hopefully) Champion's League football on the horizon.

Moreover, look at how Levy handled the Modric affair; He set his price, and waited for it to be met. That's how this will go with Bale; if we don't get a good enough offer, regardless of Bale handing in a transfer request, we won't sell him; and if we do, it'll be for a huge sum of money and/or a massive haul of players.

I think the most likely scenario IF sell him is something like Coentrao, Higauin, and 20-30 million pounds for Bale; which I would be fine with. They're both great players, and it would give us the money to go out and buy Christian Erikson or Son Heung-Min.",0,1366560132,null,0,false,0,c9jny5a,t3_1csy29,t1_c9jny5a,t3_1csy29,null,1431480228,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

My Dad is a policeman, he's not a traffic officer and when I asked him about them he said he had no idea what the legal standard actually was off the top of his head. But sometimes you see one that's far too small, you just know its not legal. If there was some other reason(s) you wanted to stop them anyway, then this can be a good way of getting what is now a ""suspect"" stopped without revealing why you actually stopped them - police actually have to have ""clear grounds"" to stop someone. Maybe you're in area that has high bike theft and you're riding through at a time that seems ""odd"" to them. That's the only time he uses it, it's not something he'd bother enforcing. Other officers may have an interest and be a bit more clued up but it'd ""unusual"" in his opinion.

He appreciated this wasn't the best answer so he said he'd ask a few of the traffic lads at work and see what their take on it was. Its worth noting the psychology of a traffic officer is completely different to a bobby, but the general public are rarely aware of this other ""breed"" of uniformed officers. Traffic officers don't see themselves as ""crime fighters"" in the sense of a police officer. A traffic officer see himself as the ""safety enforcer"" of the roads. If they can detect ""other"" crime in the process so much the better but its not their focus. They see the plate as their key way of identifying the vehicle that's why they're so hot on ""unreadable"" plates.

The answer that came back from the traffic boys was the ""actual wording of the law is ...x,y, z""  (as the other post highlighted ""163mm and a minimum width of 228mm"" but best check the DVLA wording). But they said there is a unofficial answer which is how it generally goes down.

**Unofficially** 

Start playing with the spacing, font or anything that effects their ability to read it they'll be all over you. Muck about with it in a way that leaves it just as readable they'll likely leave you alone *for the plate*. If the bike is well ridden and looks well cared for, a smaller plate wont raise the alarm.  When pushed for a figure/size, generally you'll get away with anything above 5*7 but like anything unofficial you cant rely on it. If they can read it with ease they're not bothered - their sight is likely as good as yours if not better.

But people do get done for small plates. Undeniably true, you'll even speak to someone who got done once a month for three months even though his plate was only a CM smaller. 

In reality what actually happens is the bike has been riding in a way that has offended the traffic officer's sense of safety/fair play. Probably riding a way he felt was endangering the rider or other other road users. They felt the need to punish the rider and will use whatever methods are at their disposal. Proving ""dangerous driving"" or any of the other actual driving offenses is notoriously difficult, especially if there was no accident. If you do get it through the courts the eventual punishment heavy. If the officer wants to ""wrap your knuckles"", both quickly and easily for them and make sure the punishment is proportional to what they actually saw there is an obvious shortcut for them. They'll pull you over, find something wrong with your vehicle and stick you on for that instead.  If you've a small plate they'll jump on that: fixed penalty. In the officer's mind ""brilliant, quick, easy and proportional"". It generally remains unsaid that it's your riding not the plate that's got the fine.

What does all this mean ? 

If you genuinely know your riding is safe, polite and respectful at all time then you'll likely never hear about a 5*7 plate. 

If you sometime drift over the speed limit on open roads but are pretty steady through the towns etc again you'll likely never hear from your plate. But bare in mind the time you've not checked your speed or just been a bit cheeky for a second you can guarantee there will be a policecar sat there.  All off of a sudden ""ohh that plate looks a bit small sir"". 

If you would describe your riding style as ""safe but aggressive"", don't get the plate it'll be a nightmare for you.

Any more than that, you might as well get the plate you'll be dead before the fine comes through :-)

true,satanspanties,null,null,"My boyfriend and I (long distance relationship) tend to find that the cheapest time to buy is either months in advance, or 1 - 2 weeks before; prices rocket seven days before the flight actually leaves.

We find that United is the cheapest airline.  We have experienced delays with them, but only one severe enough to miss a connecting flight, and they were pretty good about immediately booking him on the next available flight.  United flights are also rarely full to capacity, so there's a decent chance you might have an empty seat or even two next to you; a godsend in economy on an overnight flight.  By all accounts, Virgin is the nicest to fly with though.

Flying on a weekday is cheaper than the weekend; Thursday is usually the cheapest day of the week, Saturday is most expensive.  For time of year, January is cheapest, July/August is most expensive.

Other than that, my only advice is to beware booking through a third party if you have a connection to make.  I don't find anything like lastminute.com to be any cheaper than booking direct.  Since that is the case, I book direct with the airline, all flights at the same time; this ensures they have me on their records as having a connection to make, which is a massive help if the first flight is delayed.

The viewers were supposed to infer the emotional impact of a scene or story instead of being told how to feel.

Under Moffat's tenure, it feels like everything is tell. There is no real nuance, just lazy writing. All the emotion is crammed up front in the form of saccharine-sweet stories, obvious plots and swelling Brit Rock soundtracks. It's almost as if Moffat believes modern viewers are incapable of understanding how he or she is supposed to feel without obvious prompts. Even that feels different than the Davies-era Who.

You know how in American politics it's widely considered that it would be political suicide for a senior politician to announce that she or he was an atheist? Well in British politics it's almost entirely the other way round -- very few politicians would ever admit to having very strong religious convictions as there's a consensus belief that it would make them unelectable.

Tony Blair was by all accounts a very religious man during his time as Prime Minister but point-blank refused to ever talk about his beliefs. His chief spin doctor Alistair Campbell once stopped Blair from mentioning his religious beliefs when questioned by a reporter, with the now-famous words: ""[We don't do God](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429109/Campbell-interrupted-Blair-as-he-spoke-of-his-faith-We-dont-do-God.html). 

Of the current party leaders, David Cameron (leader of the Conservatives, and the Prime Minister) seems to be a Christian but seems to be very much at the religion-lite end of the Church of England -- that is, a belief that one's religion should be a private matter and decidedly unevangelical. Nick Clegg (leader of the Liberal Democrats, and the Deputy Prime Minister) is openly atheist. Ed Miliband (leader of the Labour Party) was brought up in a secular Jewish household and is also happy to say on record that he doesn't believe in God.

Going by that logic in 2018 we should replace £5 notes with £5 coins.  However at this point mars bars will be 80p.  Thinking about it logically we could in fact decide to just make 1p = 10p current money and have it at 8p.  Using a better chocolate bar, the freddo, as comparison is a shocking 20p and this will make the freddo about 27p at this time.  

Now if we decide to introduce a half-penny the freddo will cost either 2.5p or 3p.  A halfpenny would also be the equivalent of what is 3.75p.

* You will still be able to get the minimum £50 or so a week that you're entitled to and pay for now. If you wish to get more than your allowance, you may borrow more and have it automatically deducted from your future payslips. No one would force you.

* People complaining about how expensive and time consuming it will be. The mechanism for taking money from future payslips is already in place, that's what tax codes are for.

Worst of the Match: I know he scored the equaliser and gave the assist, but ultimately he was DIRECTLY responsible for the two goals. Lost Oscar on the corner. I mean he didnt have the hardest person to mark, it wasnt like he was marking victor moses. Then the hand ball was fucking retarded. No need. Seemed to snap about giving it away and having a shit game up until that point so decided that he would destory the teams good name. Not impressed. Really torn. Do we stick by him or do we give him up? Is midtable obscurity for a couple of seasons with solid investment (hopefully) from a sale of suarez and the development for the future worth it? Or is it worth letting our fine club name be tarnished further. It is one thing playing your heart out but biting someone when you fuck up. What is that? I am not sure the moments of pure ecstasy he provides are worth the trouble of destroying our credibility and class. That is something no one can destroy but ourselves. Luis needs to learn when you put that red shirt on, you have to want to win but also rise above the best in sportsmanship and grace. 
TLDR: Dont know if suarez is worth the trouble...

It just goes to show how much he loves the club and how far he will go to try and bring us back into the game. It looked like he was trying to win a penalty, winding Ivanovic up and then going down easily when he got pushed down.

Honestly, I can't believe people are saying they can't celebrate Suarez's last minute goal. It was incredible, and I was super glad that he scored there to give us a point. I think the Chelsea Match Thread circlejerk is getting into some of us here.

Edit: And we have people saying he should be let go?! Seriously? He's had a pretty bad game but he's had an incredible season.

true,avirup2008,null,null,"The reactions here are completely overwhelming. Ok, he bit the player. I think its evident, no questions asked. These will have three fallouts in that order.

1. Press goes batshit crazy asking Suarez to go to a mental institution. Fergie chips in with how Suarez is a bigger threat to humanity than all other dangers combined.

2. FA has a look, hands over a 6-7 match ban. 6 matches, out of which we could never have salvaged the season anyway. NOT a huge deal.

3. Club managers say ah, lets see, Hazard kicked a ball boy, Cantona had drop kicked a fan, lots of players have gone way over the line and Suarez has bitten twice. That must mean he is not fit to be in the team, despite the fact that he is the best out there at present.

In the end, it all goes under the water, Suarez nets another 30 next season for the club is playing in and the worship begins.

I don't support his actions on any ground. I HATE to see him stoop so low at times, becoming an animal. But people saying, he should leave us and go, we don't need him, seriously? SERIOUSLY?

We would be battling for 15th-16th (maybe even lower) if not for him. He has almost single handedly carried the club forward, given 200 percent and been our answer to other clubs saying ""You've got who, we've got Suarez. So try in vain, coz he will net 30 again.""

He IS the reason we can look up towards the future saying ,all right, we just need a support system for Suarez and we are in the race! If we think for a moment, such incidents will not happen every season and Luis would be very clear of the same. Saying that he will surely pick up a 10 match ban each season is ludicrous.

Clubs will still come calling for him with big money. And if we pretend to stand on high moral grounds and sell him, we lose out, no one else does.

Comparing Sturridge, Coutinho, Shelvey in Suarez's level is another facepalm. Sure, they can deliver if we are aiming for 10th spot even before the season begins. If we aim higher, we are under an illusion that we created for our own selves.

She used the litter tray as soon as we put one down so shes definitely house trained. We're calling her Queen for now but she doesn't have a name. 

In the photos you can see a collar. This was put on by a previous family who found her that had a phone number for them, however, it is not their cat. We will be taking her to a vet when they open tomorrow so we can check if she has a chip. Fingers crossed!

I know its a long shot but if anyone here knows if the owner or can help in any way please let me know. No offers to take her in please. If we cannot find the owner we already have a friend who is happy to take her in which is great as I'd rather she was re-homed than put in a shelter. 

She looks healthy if a little thin but nothing a feed wont help with. We've called an emergency vet for advice so we're about as prepared as we can be. Unfortunately I can't afford to get her checked out at a vet but as I say she looks to be very healthy and happy. She's been purring away ever since we got her in the house and fed her.

No he shouldn't, he's far too wasteful of possession as CAM for Rodger's system. He's much better suited to controlling the game from deep and saving his legs, to help prolong his career.

Also Lampard doesn't play as a CAM anymore, like Gerrard, he's moved further back in the midfield and plays as one of the holding two.

You can also use it for more trivial things like purchasing environmentally friendly ways to get to work, for example if you want to buy a bicycle to get to work and can't afford it [you can apply for a Cycle Scheme Loan](http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/) which is automatically deducted from your payslip, it's also tax deductible which means the salary used to purchase the bike won't count as earnings, thus lowering your income tax payable that year.

I know it's difficult, but I am gonna defend Suarez. 

I hate it when people call him a horrible human being or compare him with Joey Barton. Giggs slept with his brother's wife, Terry fucked Wayne Bridge's girlfriend, many more have assaulted women and been alcoholic and abusive. Many of them are still held in high regard by the footballing community. Is Suarez really worse than any of these guys? If he's really that bad a person why should his misconduct be limited to the football pitch? Why do we never hear of him being racist towards black people in the pub or biting people on the street? 

Now to his problems on the pitch. He's definitely no role model. He dives, he screams at people, he bites. The behaviour is unsavoury, but is the intent malicious? Roy Keane broke someone's legs and proudly told everyone that he wanted to end the guy's career, and he is a legend in man utd. From what we've seen in Suarez interviews, he never defends or glorifies his actions on pitch. He understands that he has temper and control issues, but we have never heard him say anything hateful like Keane or Barton. He even seems apologetic over his behaviour. 

He has many issues, yes, but to call him a cunt is not a view that i will stand with. ",0,1366565993,null,0,false,0,c9jpqu6,t3_1ct05n,t1_c9jpqu6,t3_1ct05n,null,1431479382,48,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,48

I remember that clip of David Cameron on that show on in America where he shot down the idea of political broadcasts. If a party leader doesn't want it then I think it's a clear sign that it's a bad idea.

true,petethepool,null,null,"he's just a little bit insane.  It's obvious.  He's a genius footballer, who has anger issues.   

Biting someone is realistically not as bad as say - lunging in two footed; the potential for long-term injury is much, much higher in the latter.  Of course, a tackle with the intent to harm is a straight red, and a three match ban.  But the bite will be longer: this is because of the social context - biting is taboo (unless in the bedroom, really); and not only that, it offers the media a fresh take on a successful narrative - this won't disappear for another 8 months (until he starts playing again, and scoring, basically).

The issue with this is not that it is more violent - relatively it isn't - but it is in the negativity that surrounds the club, and the fans, as a result.  

HOWEVER, he's by far the most exciting player I've ever seen play for Liverpool, and he's one of the best players in the world in all respects.  He's a little insane perhaps, but he's still, regardless of the likely ban he'll get over the first few games of next season, our most vital player in terms of progressing as a team.  I wouldn't dismiss him too easily.  Liverpool would miss him terribly.  

I don't believe the club should defend him exactly - the bite is indefensible - but, really, in real-world (not 'football' world) terms, it's not that big a deal.  

Think of Cantona.  Kicks an old lady, stays at Man United.  History remembers him as one of the best players to ever play in the premier League.  

If, in 3 years time, Suarez has helped play Liverpool into the Champions League, who'd yap?  I understand - believe me I do - the 'Liverpool way.'  But as well as that involves pride and respect, perhaps it's greatest attribute - certainly it's most inclusive world-wide - is the slogan, 'you'll never walk alone.'

There is generally a dip in prices down to a low about 12 to 6 weeks out, depending on demand. If they still have seats available there may be cheap seats later (often with less-desirable airlines), but they are usually expensive in the last week, regardless (unless you have a genuine emergency, in which case you might be able to talk them into an affordable seat, or a travel agent might).

A travel agent may be able to find cheaper seats or more convenient flights than you can on the Internet, it does depend if there are really cheap flights going your way, and if you are happy with their terms and conditions.

There are no points awarded for chivalry or gentlemanliness (I'm making that a word now). I understand that the club comes before a player, but remove the player, drop position on the table, and what happens? Everyone begins to complain that the team is being mismanaged, or needs to buy new players. Suarez, while unrefined at times, has proven that he works hard and can fit into any of the team's schemes. So you have to choose: keep the controversial player and win games, or lose him for playing below your moral standards and struggle to be relevant in the middle of the table? 

Yes, ideally, the club and it's players *should* never lower themselves to such uncouth behavior. But tempers flare, the game gets heated, sometimes you'll do whatever it takes to win. For some reason, Suarez apparently thought that biting Ivanovic would help. I don't understand it, but I'm sure somehow it made sense to him in that moment. He wanted to unnerve Ivanovic, get him off his game and weaken Chelsea's defense. He did something wildly unexpected and will likely face due punishment for it. 

Someone in the threads also suggested it would have been more dignified to take a swing at Ivanovic rather than biting him. Throwing a punch is a lot more obvious than what he did. He would almost certainly would have been red carded and thrown out of the game (and therefore not scored the equalizer), and would face a ban anyway. I'm not endorsing biting, but it is a little more tactful, given the situation. Still undignified, yes, put your pitchforks away, but it made more sense than a punch.

I'm apparently in the minority here, but I want Suarez to stay. He's been too good of a player this year (was expecting a player of the year award, nearly impossible now), and the last few years, to let go over this. If an angry mob drives him out, so be it. His exciting play, thrilling goals, and unending controversy (something to read about midweek) will be sorely missed.

From what I have read in Suarez' interviews, I speculate that the way he behaves on the pitch is the result of his overwhelming will to win, and a lack of control over his frustrations. He bites Ivanovic out of frustration, and not personal hatred. Keane, on the other hand, was actually looking for an opportunity to fuck a person up well and good. The difference in intention is what I'm trying to draw our attention to. 

Suarez is far from perfect, and punishment must be meted out as the rules dictate, but support and help is what he needs, not baseless accusations on his quality as a human being. 

I also don't think that I have said anything to deserve being called a disgrace. Seems like I just see Suarez differently from you, doesn't make me or anyone who upvotes me any more or less disgraceful than you.

2. Oscar was far better today than he has been over the last month or so. 

3. Suarez shouldn't have even been on the field to bite Ivanovic let alone after it.

4. Sturridge was brilliant, i am glad he has found a place to enjoy his football and a team that will play him. 

5. Sturridge could have gone off for his challenge, 2 players were sent off yesterday in Arsenal V Fulham for similar/less than his challenge. 

6. Torres, dismal.

7. Ryan Bertrand wasn't up to much today, that right flank was Liverpool's main source of attack.

8. 6 minutes was about right. BUT firstly the rule is a minimum of 6 minutes and is down to the Ref, again another BUT the goal was 40 seconds after that and there was a perfectly good chance to finish the game on the 6 minute mark in midfield.

9. Carragher... Angry all game, also lucky to still be on the field. I really dislike any player who makes it his business to be aggressive, angry, unsportsmanlike.

- the scrapes down the back of legs - probably accidental
- the little stamps - well where else was he going to put his foot? :o
- racially abusing Patrice Evra - language barrier

Biting someone?! If you got a phonecall from your kid's teacher telling you they bit someone, you'd be livid.  He's a 26 year old footballer and this is the second time he's done it - that is too much.  

He has done a lot for the club and carried the team at times and been the best player in the league.  Which is why I'll be sad to see his quality leave the team, but he has to go.  We can't be seen to condone this type of behaviour.  If you bit someone you worked with for no reason you'd be fired without question.  You could also be prosecuted for assault.  So Suarez in plain view of cameras commits an offence that is both punishable by law and would be gross misconduct, but he should stay because he's good.  Nonesense as far as I'm concerned.

If the club condones this behaviour it sends out a very clear message of what this club has become and that we'll tolerate any behaviour on the pitch as long as it comes from a good player.  I personally do not want this great club that I have supported for the last 27 years to become that type of club.  There has been a lot of criticism about what Souness has said on this subreddit.  I for one agree with him.  Suarez is destroying the reputation of the club.

What could be a positive of the situation is that this gives Rodgers to show the world what he's made of.  Kenny fucked the dog royally with the Evra situation, Rodgers can show that he is a great manager in the making and I really hope he handles it well.

We lost this game because we switched off. For both Sturride and the Surarez goals. We got lucky with Shelvey's miss. We got lucky that the first Sturridge shot wasn't a centimeter inwards. So let's not kid ourselves into thinking that the bite or extra time was the reason we lost this match. 


We lost this match because we couldn't close it down. We WERE solid for most parts, but this intermittent retard defending is quickly becoming a solid feature of the new Chelsea. Wobbly defense, untrustworthy mid-field (sometimes) and the failure to muscle the ball our and keep it there is becoming a big issue. 

You want to whine about this game. Whine about the two goals we conceded fair and square (i.e. not an offside or a foul driven goal). We drew this match because we were just.not.good.enough.

&gt;Maybe working 'hard' is relative to the economic output that worker produces.

Bollocks. Footballers have precisely 0 economic output. They are essentially entertainers, and that contributes nothing to the wealth of the nation. They're paid so much because so many people are willing to pay large amounts of money to see a very few people kick a ball around a field, so the amount of money in the business is extremely high in relation to the amount of people involved, and there are very few people who are very good at kicking a ball around a field, so there is a large amount of competition to hire good players. Footballers do not add value to anything, they do not take something and create a product for sale, they do not create wealth; they kick a ball around a field and lots of people watch. That entertainment is of course necessary, but it is not economic output.

Salaries are not determined by the actual economic output of the work, but rather the perceived utility, the availability of people who are deemed qualified, the income of the company / the number of workers and various other factors. One of the greatest lies of our current age is that those who are wealthy are wealthy because they *deserve* it.

2. If he continues to play as he has been this season his transfer value probably wont drop, imo. But if he stays in and we get into the top 4 next season, we wouldnt need to sell him anyway

3. He'll leave next season if we dont get into the champions league, without him there's absolutely no chance but with him - as long as we strengthen - then we have a chance.

My god it's getting hard to defend him but he is a magnificent footballer, and I think that without that fire in his belly that he'd be a lesser player than he is. He just needs to stop that fire from taking control of his actions.

I imagine you'll hear similar counter-arguments when you call them up to what I had.

 - ""It's not a significant change""

Bullshit. On 100Mbps, I can burn through 3.5GB in 4 minutes 40 seconds.

 - ""I've looked at your account and based on how you've been using it, it won't affect you"".

Be that as it may, for all you know, I signed this contract precisely because I was expecting my circumstances to change and I might actually need 100Mbps to mean 100Mbps.

 - ""Nobody else even offers 100Mbps so it's not like you'll gain anything by moving"".

I note the throttle takes it down to about the speed of ADSL 2 in this country - meaning they could legitimately use this as a counter-argument. But BT's Infinity service is 80Mbps and at the top tier is never throttled. (Check to see if Infinity is available in your area; if it is you've suddenly got a much stronger argument).

 - ""Everyone else operates a similar policy""

Not true, but even if it was, there is a reason I did not sign a contract with anyone else. You're offering a premium product for which I'm paying a premium price, by changing your contract to be in line with everyone else, it's suddenly not a premium product any more.


You could always suggest that to avoid breaking the contract, they continue to offer you unthrottled internet. Which is what you signed up for in the first place, and is a perfectly reasonable request.

They'll refuse - not necessarily because they don't want to, but because their system is explicitly designed so there's only a handful of service levels available. If there is no such thing as a never-throttled 100Mbps service available to anyone, they can't put you on it. 

 - ""We can't set it so you're never throttled; this is being rolled out to everyone"".

I accept that you cannot set my broadband up that way, but - with the best will in the world, and not wishing to sound rude - that is no concern of mine.

I loved Jane Tennision, and feel Prime Suspect really started it all in regards to modern-day gritty crime-drama. The drawn out plodding slowness of working a case, not summed up in 42 minutes, is how I like it.

I guess Sherlock counts as a British detective as well, so toss Holmes and Watson in the mix, too.

Since Forbrydelsen was from DK I guess it doesn't count, but it did air on BBC4 so I got to mention that. I thoroughly enjoyed all three series and have a special fondness for Sarah Lund. 

I've recently started watching this young Morse show ""Endeavour"" and think it's quite good. The pilot and the first episode of the new series has been very strong and the crimes aren't convoluted and sensational. That's what I like best about UK crime shows. Unlike US shows that pile on the extreme violence, most of the stuff from the UK generally feels realistic and has some believable explanation that extends beyond someone just being a plain old boring psychopath.

Tevez tried to make an almost identical pass in the 2nd half, except Tommy was on at that point and tracked Milner's run, forcing Tevez to send the ball back towards midfield.

Moreover, Parker's lack of positional discipline on the attacking end helped to neuter our attack in the first half; with Parker barging forward, Dembele was forced to sit back more often and break up City's play in front of our defenders, when it should very obviously be Parker doing that. Really honestly, when did Scotty contribute ANYTHING to the win today? At what point was he not either anonymous or a liability on the pitch?

I love Scotty, or rather, loved him. He was fantastic last year. But for whatever reason this year, he's just not the same player. He doesn't get stuck in like he used to, and he is just not at all the type of player we need; you're 100% right about that. He has no positional discipline, offense or defense; I can't count the number of times he'll tackle someone, but we won't win possession, and he'll just let the man he's standing next to walk away from him into space, only to throw himself at another tackle.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Yeah, on a shared line it's quite easy to hit these caps assuming you're getting a good speed in the first place. I have a feeling you'll be out of luck finding somewhere better value for money even given these new caps by Virgin though.

You're not likely to reliably match it for the same price with any adsl provider unless you have someone trialling/running an unusually awesome service in your particular area.

Virgins networks do seem to be struggling recently too, but you should also remember that these caps are the only way their network can currently cope with the amount of traffic they get at peak times. Basically if you wanted a line that allowed you to transfer at 100Mbps 24/7 you would simply have to pay a very large amount of money for it, like 10x what you are paying now.

Just a warning anyway, don't move before you're extremely certain it will be better, because there's a huge chance you'll end up with something worse. Unless you're in an area where Virgin is struggling to even provide the advertised speeds (including these capped speeds) I would hazard a guess that this is still the best you'll find.

*Edit: Just looked into BT Infinity mentioned by jimicus below - it looks like they just changed their terms a few months ago which makes this service actually look half decent now!

true,[deleted],null,null,"From New England––the tl;dr is ""it's a 'family thing.'""

My grandparents lived in London for about 5 years in the late 1990's/early 2000's. My grandpa worked as an architect and his friends there/in LDN got him into Spurs. He was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan as a kid, so Tottenham were a good fit––the blue and white, the rivalry with the other big-city teams, the ""we'll get 'em next year"" heartbreak factor. They got me a kit and everything. I didn't care about soccer at the time, but I never was interested in any other teams, either.

In 2008 I finally became obsessed soccer from watching the Euros, and I began to follow Spurs more intensely around then (it was a pretty fortuitous time to dial up my fandom, I admit, but w/e). This coincided with my grandparents developing some pretty serious health issues. Long story short, my grandfather has to be on medication that disorients him and clouds his thinking. He also is prone to being melancholy when discussing the past and doesn't speak up as often, which is a shame since he was previously very talkative and lively. But since we were both die-hard Spurs fans by now, we had something to talk about––to kind of break through the fog. If you mention, say, whether or not Adebayor is overpaid, he'll perk up and start talking and it's like the good ol' days again. 

So basically I follow Spurs because they're just part of the family ""routine"" now. Even if they sold all their best players I wouldn't change my rooting interest, because Tottenham are just a part of my family history now.

Yes but the match does not create capital - it does not create wealth. let X represent the wealth of society before the match. What is the wealth of society after the match? X + what? All the ticket sales? But the money spent on those tickets existed in society beforehand. Nothing permanent has been created by 22 people kicking a ball about. There is not more than there was before the match. Therefore, the wealth of society after the match is still X. The match was entertainment for immediate consumption, and the act of consumption does not create capital, it does not increase the output of society. 

Consumption of course drives demand and the creation of products which can create wealth for society, but immediate performances (like football) create value that is immediately consumed. The fact that this act of consumption funded wealth creating companies isn't relevant - if it was, we would say that I created wealth when I ate dinner! After all, I had to pay for the ingredients and the electricity, etc. Yet it would be very strange to think that me eating dinner added any wealth to society.

In the past it's been done with words like: He who does not work, neither shall he eat. With words like: People are just looking for an excuse not to work. With words like: the deserving poor. That's actually happened in UK politics before. You champion the 'hard workers' and bang on about the 'feckless'. You bind together the words 'benefits' and 'scrounger', the words 'benefits' and 'fraud' and the words 'disability' and 'benefits' until mentioning one immediately brings all the others to mind. You highlight individual cases. You leave details out, twist others.

'So called MS sufferer earns £105 000 a year on benefits, plays squash at weekends' - because she gets DLA to help her deal with the fact that her MS makes it difficult see writing, but doesn't stop her working, or in fact playing squash. And, of course, her MS is invisible, but that doesn't mean it's there.

But it does then make you angry about this 'fraud', that the system is allowing to continue, and you look at your much-less-than-£105k that you're just about getting by on, and you assume that you could be getting that £105k if you only just knew how to game the system, which you won't, because you're angry and you reason that you're paying for this cheat. And by now you literally cannot think about disability any more without thinking about benefits, and thinking about fraud, and remembering these cases.

What if those Clara's are all projections? They are there, they are real, they think they are real, but they are in fact a shadow from a prime Clara that exists somewhere else. She could be trapped and subconsciously broadcasting herself on a quantum level, creating vast coincidences that would lead to her continuous rebirth at times and places where she is likely to meet the doctor.

Another option. The doctor has never (in my recollection) been betrayed by one of his companions. Clara obviously cares about him, but maybe she needs him for something. Maybe her job is to win his trust, keep him and herself alive, for some sort of future event they are moving to. All this orchestrated by the great intelligence. 

Another option: she is a quantum experiment, existing at different moments in time until she meets the doctor and tries to survive the event that causes it. After the event ends, and she is safe with the doctor, the next stage of the experiment begins. (that's where we are now) Also see the ""river song never lost the ability to regenerate""-theories.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think I should clarify my previous statement, I'm actually trying to make the point that we should give people more education about real world finances and actually prepare them for this kind of situation, rather than allow companies to bombard them with opportunities to loan a grand at 1700% APR. 

I'm a firm believer that prevention is better than cure, and I do think a lot of this kind of problem can be solved by removing the kind of wilful ignorance that is involved in people giving in to loans for non-essentials. 

I've been unemployed before, granted I don't have a family to look after and I only drew 3 weeks of unemployment benefit, but I managed to feed myself quite well and have enough left over for a weekly bus ticket into town for the job hunt. The problem is, a lot of people are still going down the pub with some mates even when they don't have the money to spend, or buying new designer clothes or whatever when what they need to be doing is feeding themselves. Debt is far too accessible and something like the student loans system is going to be invisible to them on a daily basis, which I don't think is going to encourage anyone back to work. It will make unnecessary spending much more accessible though. 

edit: Plus we have a systemic culture of entitlement in this country, which is another root of this particular issue. 

I don't think having more personal debt is a good long term solution for the unemployed, as it will encourage people to be lazy. 

edit 2: I'm not disagreeing with you, I just think there needs to be a more comprehensive solution than simply throwing more negative numbers at peoples names. ",0,1366583887,null,0,1366584368,0,c9jvljh,t3_1csj3i,t1_c9jvljh,t1_c9jvdb7,null,1431476553,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It has an amazing economy, and fairly low crime. Those are the upsides I can mention.

That said, if you're desperate for a job this place is a boomtown and the recession hasn't touched us in the slightest, still fewer than 1 applicant per job opening, wages are frequently better than elsewhere (like I get paid &gt;£7 for dogsbody jobs, I've friends who earn close to 20K without uni education in their early 20's) - then again they have to be, rent in Aberdeen is very high (Not quite London, but really not far off).

I guess my advice is, this place is tolerable for a year or two so if you really need a job come out, get one, see what you think of the joint, and go from there. Just don't plan to live here forever or anything, I've got plenty of friends who despite their relatively well paid jobs (and they all *have* jobs because work is plentiful) are still saving up to move somewhere with an uncertain job market and lower pay, just because Aberdeen truly becomes somewhere to escape after a few years (I hit the 5 year mark in June, I'll be gone by close of 2013).

edit: Caveat on all of this is, if you're in Aberdeen it's easier to get into the oil industry, if you get into the oil industry you'll be minted and you can live pretty much anywhere you want to which is within reasonable travelling distance of Aberdeen (so easily anywhere in the British Isles if you don't mind losing 24 hours of each 2 weeks off).",0,1366585096,null,0,false,0,c9jvz57,t3_1ctjyr,t1_c9jvz57,t1_c9jvv65,null,1431476375,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Haha! You've just let out the plot for the very lazy Doctor Who episode I think. The multi-dicked monster is overworking porn stars leading to a sharp decline in the revenue for the Californian porn industry because the dick-fiend could go through so many scenes and plots. It starts to multiply, the offspring affecting Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Brazil, and China and Japan. This brings the economy to it's knees, trapping the regions in an unbearable recession the likes of which have never been seen before! This naturally causes them to branch out, waging war on surrounding regions in a bid to claim more resources but it doesn't work, if's just a tonne of global conflicts and suffering at the hands of this gigantic ball of dicks.

It isn't likely but i would like to see a return of the Ood from 'Satan Pit'
I remember at the end of the episode the Doctor takes the Tardis to rescue anyone still left on the planet but 'didn't have time to save the Ood'. the Tardis being able to travel through time, running out of it seems odd.
Could be he did go back for the Ood before everyone else, but since they were exposed to the psychic influence of the creature for so long they were still evil, so he couldn't just let them run around the universe. He would have still wanted to help them though as they were really just victims, so he kept them on the Tardis until he could find a way to help them.

You can't, unless you want to take it all the way to court, in which case it's far more trouble than it's worth-- and will probably end up costing you more anyway. Basically all these companies have covered themselves perfectly in their contract wording. Their lawyers have exploited whatever loopholes are available to them, and they abuse things like the fact law allows for ""reasonable"" contract adjustments or inflationary price rises. 

It makes me furious. Internet and phone companies are the worst for it. I tried to get out of a T-mobile contract because they dropped my unlimited package to 500mb (?!?!?). ""Resistance' isn't even the word for it-- it's pretty much impossible. Basically there's a 30 day leaving notice you have to give, and they always tell you this when you buy a contract. Ever wondered why? It's partially because after 30 days you lose any legal right to get out of a contract when it's been changed. 

When you ring up and tell them you want out, they'll say to ring back in 30 days. They'll stall you any way they can, and they will always get the better of you because the ball's in their court. Then after 30 days they'll say you can't leave a contract that's been changed after 30 days, and they'll read out the fucking legal code to you on the phone. When you try to explain the ludicrous catch-22 situation you've been put in, they'll say ""sorry we understand but there's nothing we can do"" (:@). If you yell enough you can get at the most £5 off your monthly bill with most companies.

Factual and news programming is stripped of any integrity, as the corporations that provide the cash for the TV channels have financial, and therefore, editorial control of the output - have you ever wondered why the BBC is so widely praised for the quality of it's documentaries and news coverage ?

As for pubs : I live in Ghent myself and we have ""Overpoort Bowl"" which broadcasts Sporting Telenet (It's like the Belgian SkySports, but it doesn't work the same way). It broadcasts all the big games of the weekend. (Premier League, Jupiler Pro League, Serie A, Liga, ...)

We also know the TARDIS has some issues with her. Why is this? Are we being misled by Moffat, or lied to?
