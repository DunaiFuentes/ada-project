The traditional idea of a loan is to send a player out to another club to build experience and allow them to develop a better understanding of the game. The newer secondary purpose seems to be a 'try before you buy' situation like we had with Sahin and the attempted loan for Mata.

I like it. If the correct stipulations are in place it's a good way to do due diligence for the club signing the player and a great way to offload a player, albeit temporarily for the player's former club.

I can understand people having a certain amount of trepidation loaning a player from a competitor. I have no issue sending players out on loan to the Championship because the clubs aren't likely to be a direct threat. Taking a loanee from Chelsea and spending time and money to develop him to be a clinical striker for them is a daunting situation.

I understand that anyone will require time.  The key problem I have is that quite a few things point the wrong way.  The acquisition of Kone A. seems quite a waste thus far, and creativity in front of goal has been quite low.

Anyway, I am happy to give Martinez a chance, provided we keep Fellaini and Baines.  I honestly think I could keep Everton in the Premier League if I have the team we've got now.  There's little to lose there, and a lot to gain if I do turn out to be wrong.

2. **Gameswipe** - Unlike shows like Cybernet which were only shown at 4 in the morning on ITV, Gamezville which was hosted by two godawful 'gangsta' tryhards and GamesMaster which has long since been extinct, Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe-style take on game shows was a refreshing look at what gaming tv shows should have been about. In my opinion 10 O'Clock Live (which had an awful second series) should be cancelled and Charlie Brooker should instead focus on this. The Last Leg pretty much fulfills TOCL's role better anyway by actually being *funny.*

3. **Whose Line Is It Anyway (or Fast and Loose if the format were improved)** - The latter was a good idea in theory but had flawed execution. There was little variation in guests and (just like Mock The Week) had become samey and boring. The interpretative dance round was funny at first but had become stale just like everything else on the show. Hugh Dennis was not a bad host though.

4. **Mock The Week pre-2009** - The problem with Mock the Week is that the new regular (Chris Addison) gets annoying very quickly, the same old guests appear on the show and most of them are either not funny or only occasionally come out with decent material, the show is far too focused on ""Scenes We'd Like To See"" and has neglected the need for four regulars and the initial need for every panelist to do standup. Of course, Frankie Boyle and Russell Howard will pretty much never return. Frankie Boyle has spent the last four years trying way too hard to be controversial and Russell Howard has spent the last three years working on a show where he regurgitates headlines and funny videos, pictures and stories found on the internet, then makes (mostly bad) jokes over them. I'll give the show another year until it gets cancelled in its current state unless Frankie Boyle magically comes back to the BBC.",0,1377998644,null,0,1377998915,0,cbzcg9u,t3_1lgfq5,t1_cbzcg9u,t3_1lgfq5,null,1429631311,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There with mostly girls -boys were still in the que but I'd arrived with the ladies ;) - and full disclosure, I was half cut, but another woman from our group arrives and I try to rearrange seats and knock the table behind me. There's a smash but it doesn't even register as I'm still sorting out this seating issue. Once that's all done I'm accosted by a mixed race, maybe 5'5"" mini-muscle-monster who is shouting in my face about his pint that I spilt (which he later told the bouncer he was holding at the time so I don't know how that happened, maybe his arms were all show and he just couldn't hold up almost half a kilogram of liquid any more).

I'm drunk, but still functional at this point, but turning around and having someone shouting in your face is REALLY disorientating. My first reaction is to ask ""What happened?"", but obviously I just received the same question repeated back at me in disgust. I apologize, but again ask what happened and get the same response, but louder.

Now I didn't just mention he was mixed race for no reason (or because it mattered up to this point). One of the black girls in our group just starts screaming ""THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T DATE BLACK MANS"" amongst other things relating to the apparent downsides of dating men with darker pigment. Another black girl in our group joins in with the same rhetoric.

At this point it's worth noting that an acquaintance of mine has swooped in with a fresh pint and I'm sat down apologising to my girlfriend for the less than great start to the night. The two black girls are still shouting at him, defending themselves against accusations of being ""race traitors"". Something someone says causes me to laugh which offends the gentleman, he tells me that ""you shouldn't fucking be laughing mate"" as he launches the new pint over me and my girlfriend. I hadn't been looking at him at all since sitting down, and after a second of ""Why am I suddenly wet? Did I piss myself? No, you don't piss from your hair..."" I figure it out and looking at my group just loudly announce ""SPILLAGE IS LICKAGE"".

A bouncer swoops straight after, which is good considering that my friends said he looked like he wanted to kill me.

Aside from all the drama, a girl from our group asked the girl he was with to calm him down and she said nothing, but looked terrified. I feel bad thinking about her :(",0,1378000600,null,0,false,0,cbzd0g1,t3_1lcuhz,t1_cbzd0g1,t3_1lcuhz,null,1429631050,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I feel this deserves a really long response but i'm pretty busy right now. Hopefully I'ma edit this later.  The problem is there ISN'T really good Chinese player to buy. You're 100% right though, they'd love it.

All of my co-workers are Chinese and they LOVE the NBA. It's huge in China. 

The biggest problem with China is with regards to soccer it's a cluster fuck. The youth system is non-existent. The league is .. awful at best. 


&gt;Picture this. Pick up a Chinese kid from Shanghai when he's 15, put him in the youth squad. Develop him while simultaneously using him as the face of both Spurs and UA in China. It's glorious. He'll spend a few years developing, and may come into a player we use in cup matches to help spread the name in China. He'll be plastered all over China in UA stores, and on our landing page for China.


If only there was a Chinese starlet. It'd be perfect. But it comes back to the Chinese youth system being awful (maybe we should kidnap a few 5 year olds and raise them at Enfield)


&gt;I'm sorry to say it (I am an American) but the US is a bit of an afterthought in the football world, and if we're going to make sacrifices to grow the brand it should be out east and not in the US. Its better to spend money to raise a Chinese player than to send youth prospects to the US and not gain much whole risking a potential first team player.


Right now sure. but unlike China the US has a growing/good youth system. A solid(ish) league. A lot more money to spend on soccer (this could change) etc. China could pay off in 25 years.

1. Chelsea
2. City
3. Man U
4. Liverpool
5. Tottenham
6. Arsenal

Admittedly this is a tad optimistic but I honestly believe 3rd, 4th and 5th could be any of Man U, Liverpool &amp; Tottenham.

Arsenal shouldn't be in with a shout. Their only player they've brought in is a 29 year old has-been. They're riddled with injuries and I don't see them playing nearly as well as last year so far. 5th would be good for them this season.

Tottenham, while signing some quality players, have played abysmally in their first few games. The Palace game was scrappy at best (I was there with my brother who supports Palace). They were very lucky to get 3 points. And let's just remember - they *will* lose Bale (let's be honest, it's that or Levy has just spent all his money), and they haven't scored from open play *2 games in*. Their chemistry has been raped with a load of new signings and I don't see them playing at their best until after January. They may boss it and get 3rd if they start playing well, but right now they'll be lucky to get 4th.

Man U have a medicore manager with a classy 1st XI, but not much in the way of depth. If they lose more than 1 player in any position there are very few alternatives. RVP &gt; Hernandez is probably their strongest depth. And let's be honest, Hernandez is no RVP. Moyes was always over-achieving at Everton, but I reckon he'll collapse under the pressure at United. He plays anti-football (shown by a recent post here how Man U are playing more long-balls than last season already) and that's not Man U's style. I still think they'll do well because they do have an awesome team, but I think 3rd will be highest. And 5th if they play poorly.

As for us...we've done what we weren't doing last season which is winning games even when we're playing badly. We played well against Stoke and hung on. We were shit against Villa for the second 45 and again hung on. If we can keep it up, the sky is the limit. If we can beat Man U tomorrow (and with a little luck I don't see why not) then we'll have a shit-load of momentum going into the international break. I don't think 4th is unreasonable. We may not have the 1st XI of Man U or Tottenham but our depth is a lot stronger imo (except in CDM), and so is our chemistry.",0,1378003777,null,0,false,0,cbzdxtq,t3_1lhun4,t1_cbzdxtq,t3_1lhun4,null,1429630617,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

The main question you probably wanna ask yourself is where do you fancy studying? British Unis can be found in pretty much every location imaginable, from the centre of London, to a Norman castle in the North of England, to a glorified village in the centre of rural Wales. The advantage to studying somewhere like London is that there's lots to see and do, and travelling should be relatively easy, and I guess there'll be more international students too (though being from the US, language and culture shouldn't be much of an issue). This'll apply to most cities, like Manchester, Liverpool or Birmingham (not an exhaustive list). Universities in smaller towns tend to have a friendlier atmosphere amongst students, and you'll certainly get a more 'unique' experience, however they can be a pain to get to and there's less to do in your down time.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Couple issues with sending players to the MLS.

First, part of the issue with sending youngsters over to the states is that they are not being exposed to the English game and just as important English footballing culture.  Asking a kid who is 18-21 to settle in a new country and develop is a big ask.  Look at Tomislav Gomelt, promising young kid in the academy...we sent him on loan to Spain last year and he never played, hell i'm not even sure he even practiced, he ended up leaving the team for a period of time to return to Croatia most likely because he was having issues settling.  There has been concerns about Coulibaly about the same thing.  The advantage of having a kid on loan in England is you can get people over to him and check on him easily,you know the coaches, he is going to be close to family and friends.  Basically you have the player in a controlled environment.

Secondly.  The MLS's season is inverted from the PL season.  If the team you send the player to doesn't make the playoffs it means he is done in what? November?...means you lose the player during preseason when the coaches actually have extended time to work with the youth.  Means our staff lose important time with a player to work with them and when they are winding down from a season we are in the middle of ours. 

Not to say that we couldn't send a player or two, we sent Simon Dawkins at one point. We offered Bentley over there at one point but he didn't want to go.  Problem is for a player on a PL squad MLS is viewed as a step down in their career in a country that is not populated with a large scouting network so there isn't even as much a of a chance to been seen by another team.",0,1378007047,null,0,false,0,cbzew5x,t3_1lhr9e,t1_cbzew5x,t1_cbzce3z,null,1429630172,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

And what I dislike is that it isn't about the companions...it's about the doctor. the movie needed, to me, to find a happy medium...Casting was not so great in every sense but the Doctor himself. I do love the 8th doctor. I imagine him as a more philosophical doctor, enjoying the arts, a renaissance man, if you will, and a person of learning, as opposed to the person of adventure the Doctor has been the last few incarnations. Also, the fact that Fox pushed the 8th Doctor into doing all kinds of things that ""hearkened"" back to the old show made it tough sometimes. I just like to imagine that because he is a fresh regeneration, he doesn't yet know who he is, so falls back on old tendencies until he can better settle himself. I think a lot of why I like the movie now is because it is the only video presentation of the 8th Doctor, and the way I've imagined him has him in my favorites. So give it a while. perhaps a long while...then watch it again...and if you don't like it, I don't blame you.

Because the minor leagues aren't just second rate players, they're the youth players too. The one day all stars right after they are drafted. The atmosphere is important at the minor league games, it's very personal. People build these personal bonds with the one day all-stars.  They follow the ones they saw (and often times met) through their careers.

Similarly the people where we loaned them to (hopefully San Jose) would feel this personal connection with them and follow them when they tear up Europe in a few years :)

&gt;Spurs brand isn't gonna grow in America bc an MLS team acquires one of their youth players on loan.

I think it would build in the city we sent them to. Plus during away games we'd be show casing our future to the city where the match was being played.

true,jerkidiot,flair4,,"I have the best AAA minor league baseball team in the country in my own city and I couldn't name our starting line up. Sure they are good for a watch but let's be real, people care about the big leagues way more. So I guess while I see how it could be novel to follow someone's career from the minors on up, I think the vast majority of people would disagree that you build a ""personal"" relationship of any sort with a minor league player. In world class football, if a player is young and promising you want to loan them where they have the best chance to develop against the best competition, ie not the MLS. And in the case of a young ""superstar"" you wouldn't loan them at all, period.

Also, I don't know why you think Spurs (or any team) loaning a youth player to the MLS would get tons of media coverage? MLS teams barely get any transfer coverage unless its a big name, so it's highly unlikely people outside of spurs fan base would ever know or care that spurs had loaned a certain player to an American side. I also suspect that from a developmental standpoint most of us would disapprove. 

Finally, something I think you're missing completely is the fact that just bc a player is loaned to a squad, doesn't mean you are bound to follow the next squad that player goes to. Fans generally support the team not individuals. To get back to your baseball example, say a player comes up in the AAA system of my local team, he looks promising, and all of a sudden, the major league affiliate sells his rights to another team in a trade deal. Am I all of a sudden a fan of his new team? Hell no. I think your hearts in the right place but you are just dead wrong on this one.

It was an attempt to relaunch the series in 1996. 

As a stand-alone movie, it's severely lacking. It's a movie about a guy who can travel through time and space, yet all the action takes place over the course of one day in one city. There's a TINY bit of time travel, where they travel backward for one day for some reason.

However, if you look at it as a pilot episode/reboot of a new series and not a stand-alone movie, it's pretty great. It's WAY better than the 2005 'Rose' pilot (which I just rewatched the other day). That episode has no time travel, and it's severely cheesy. 

If I were in charge of getting someone interested in Doctor Who, and I could ONLY show them the 1996 movie OR 'Rose', I would pick the movie.

true,MrSpurrier,null,null,"Yesterday demonstrated most of things i've been annoyed about the hammers in the last few seasons.
Big Sam has done a great job at getting the team to play as a unit which has made us hard to break down defensively (in most games) which is all well and good, but attacking, we are dreadful. It seems we're too predictable when attacking that even the likes of Stoke find it easy to press us out of the game. We can counter very well, but this isn't enough. We needed to sign at least 1 creative midfielder in my opinion. Someone that can play in front of Diame and Noble that isn't Nolan (Ravel? Joe Cole?) to link up with our striker. Which brings me on to my next point. We NEED a god damn striker immediately. Yes, we signed Carroll but we can't hope that he's going to be fit for every game. 

Sam signed a talented and experienced fullback who had played in the champions league just last season with Shakhtar, so why on earth is he playing Joey O'Brien over him? Who, by the way, isn't good enough in my opinion. Same thing happened with Paulista and Chamakh last season. What's the point of signing these players and not even giving them a decent chance, especially when we needed someone up top when Carroll was out....again, last season.

Coming onto Maiga, who had a horrid game, but i still feel there's more to come from him. He still hasn't played a whole lot of first team football for us and needs to be given more of a chance. I feel his only problem is that he's lazy and needs to be more physical to hold up the play etc. Look at the game against Newcastle with his off the ball movement that created one of the goals and his hold up play. If he can build off that then he will be a good player for us, but that's whether he improves or not.

Lastly our board need to take more risks with players and just sign people. Seeing David Gold on SSN the other day saying that clubs need to be more careful when over stepping the spending budget to sign 1 more player was frustrating. We will never get better with the players we have. A strong mid-table position is probably the best it's going to get for us at this moment in time which is all well and good but there's always the risk of under performing for too many games and ending up in a relegation fight.

true,howardljones,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol,"When I was in the 5th year and 6th form, we used to go over the local pub once-a-week, have a couple of pints and return to school a little worse for wear. The school had a zero tolerance to alcohol so we would time our pub trips with the quietest afternoon in our schedule, which was always a Friday. The pub was quite large and with different rooms in it - a main area with pool table, a lounge-type room, and a function room, all of which could be served by the same bar. We got friendly with the landlord who, unknown to us at the time, knew EXACTLY what the score was concerning our ages and the school's alcohol policy, but I think he needed the money during an otherwise dead time of the day. Although he was really chilled with us, he would always warn us to never go into the lounge, to the point that he did get fairly aggressive with one of us about it. We just thought he didn't want some young beer boys spoiling the atmosphere in there or something. Anyway (I was 18 at this point), one day I was walking into the pub late, so decided to have a look in the fabled lounge area without the landlord knowing.  I opened the door to the lounge area... and was met by half the school's teaching staff.  It was a moment where the music stopped and all eyes turned to look at me. It turned out that the landlord had been keeping the teachers and students separate for many years (even before me and my mates started going there), each group sneaking away to the same place to do exactly the same thing, and separated only by a wall and a very wily landlord.

true,msweatherwax,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"I spent some time working with people who had fallen into the payday loan trap, and it's a damning indictment on the state we're in as a country, in many ways.  The vast, *vast* majority of the people I was trying to help were not using these loans to purchase luxury items, or even to help with one off expenses like car repairs - they were using them to pay for shortfalls in essential living expenses such as rent/mortgage, food, or utilities.  

Worryingly, the majority did not have one payday loan, they had *multiple* payday loans.  A lot of them were loosing a huge chunk of their wage in 'roll-over"" fees alone without ever reducing the capital loan amount. There was one guy in particular who stands out in my mind who was paying £240 a month interest on 8 payday loans (all £200) - he'd been servicing them for 18 months when he finally got help, and had paid nearly £4500 interest on the original £1600 of credit.  In the end, he'd moved his wage payment to a new account, then set up repayment plans (the interest and fees were supposed to be frozen).  When the PDL companies agreed to the payment plan, he'd given them his card details and/or set up direct debits to make the payment.  The first payday the plan was in operation, he went to the bank to get cash out to get to work, and discovered that two of the companies had systematically emptied his bank account overnight of every penny he had.  By the time he got to us, he was genuinely suicidal.  

The other one that sticks in my mind is the woman who came in with her 16 year old son who had applied for a £300 PDL for a laugh with one of his mates, never thinking he'd get it - unfortunately, he did and proceeded to spend the money (not smart, but not nearly as stupid as having such lax checking procedures that you'd actually loan money to an unemployed 16 year old).  She'd tried to set up a £50 a month payment plan on his behalf and as you might guess, had her bank account emptied overnight because the £300 had been quadrupled with late payment and other spurious fees.

What I learned from the experience is that firstly, as a country, our financial education is woeful.  So many of the people I spoke to had no idea how CCA's and direct debits actually work, or had no idea that as they were on a low income they were entitled to financial assistance that would have avoided having to take PDL's in the first place.  Secondly, the High Street banks are utterly complicit in allowing shark like practices from the PDL Co's.  Every single person that I spoke to who had money taken from their account was told by their bank that they couldn't recover it, and the majority were told that they could not do anything to stop continuing payment authorities set up on their account.  

Quite honestly, I think this is all building up to becoming a serious crisis.  ",0,1378030693,null,0,false,0,cbzj90w,t3_1li5k1,t1_cbzj90w,t3_1li5k1,null,1429628102,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

If you asked any fans on this subreddit whether Hillsborough remarks by United fans or Munich remarks by Liverpool fans are made more often, then undoubtedly everyone would say Hillsborough. If you asked the same question on /r/reddevils, then everyone would say the opposite. Fact is, nobody can set their natural biases aside and see that all fans are essentially the same - we just support different clubs.

It's the same reason why most people here would have seen Suarez's racism saga as a situation of unfair persecution, while we would have just considered it to be dickish behaviour. Very rarely will you have a fan step outside the norm and say: ""actually guys, Suarez using that language on a football field is pretty unacceptable, despite the fact he plays for our team"" or ""You know, I'm not sure there's enough evidence in this case to give Suarez an 8 game ban"". I'm guilty of club bias too.

Fact of the matter is, *Come Fly With Me*, *Always Look on the Bright Side of Life* and *I Like to Move It* are just cheesy songs that are easy to sing along to.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I'm not actually sure if this is a joke or not. But I'll explain anyway:

It's more for catastrophic things, so for example you lose your job and so you use your savings (some are even too proud to sign on at first) to meet outstanding expenses (like rent and the iPhone contract etc. that you could previously afford).

Then when you can't find a job in the middle of a recession you begin to cut back as your savings are becoming depleted so you get rid of the phone contract etc. but if you are tied into a mortgage or a lease you are pretty fucked in that respect.

So your savings are being whittled away, bit by bit... and you cut back more and more. Then suddenly your fridge/boiler breaks etc. and you need to pay to replace/fix it, but your depleted savings are insufficient.

So it could happen even to fiscally responsible people - now add in the real-life stuff like the fact that it's easy to become complacent about saving if you have what you assume is a stable job and you can see how it's relatively common.

I estimate my savings would last me about a year if I signed on, six months if I didn't. And if I suddenly had to pay hundreds of pounds to get shit fixed, that'd knock a month or so off. And I save quite a bit (but am also very young, thus why I don't have vast reserves).

true,ZoFreX,eng-GreaterLondon,Wimbledon,"I used to bounce from job to job (contracting) and location to location so had lots of cash flow issues and the like... first time I took out a payday loan was actually because my neighbour owed me money and wasn't able to pay me back in time, and I had bills coming up - much better to pay through the nose on interest than let a bill bounce. I've taken them out a few times since, generally due to poor planning / spending and my piss-poor credit meaning no-one else will lend me any money. I've rolled over a couple of times but it's never gotten out of control.

I'm lucky though, because of my situation my money issues were always temporary, I had enough money on average but it came in blips and bursts, so I could always pay the loans off after a month or two and avoided going into a debt spiral.

My experiences are pretty mixed. Wonga get a lot of flak but credit where credit is due, they won't give me a loan because of my history, and I think that's correct. There are some dodgy companies out there that I think would give just about anyone a loan, you will regret dealing with them though. I took out a loan with LendingStream a year ago and they still haven't stopped texting me - I didn't opt in for marketing texts, there is no way on their website to opt-out, I've even changed my mobile phone number in the website's settings and I still get a text message from them on average every other day (18 texts from them last month).

The sketchiest part with them though is that once I'd taken out my first loan, before I'd even paid it back they were sending me texts saying that I would get instant approval on an even larger loan. That's not responsible lending!

Oh, and some of them will spam you just for enquiring. QuickQuid declined me, but send me a few letters every month advertising their services nonetheless.

Overall they weren't terrible, and on the rare occasion where I couldn't pay back straight away they were fairly helpful and things never got ridiculous. I do regret dealing with these companies because I'm sure it's left a black mark on my record, and I'm fed up with the sheer volume of spam they've sent my way.

It's important to acknowledge that under-occupancy is an issue, but the so-called bedroom tax is precisely the wrong way to go about resolving it. No matter what the Tories think, ordinary people cannot just up-sticks and find somewhere else to live at the drop of a hat, so the effect of the bedroom tax will not greatly affect occupancy rates, it will simply push the poorest people in society into deeper privation as they have to absorb the cost. Schools, jobs, social circles and family all mean that people rarely move from one end of the country to the other, and it's not as though there is a glut of council housing for people to relocate to. The Tories know this of course, and are obviously more concerned with reducing the money spent on housing benefit than they are with reducing under-occupancy. The bedroom tax is a cost-cutting measure, nothing more.

Punishing poor people for having a spare room, particularly in a method as lacking nuance as the one the government has employed (for example forcing couples and children of below a certain age to share a room, even if disabilities mean this condition is unlivable, and denying disabled people a spare room to store needed medical equipment - both of these situations have already occurred) is fundamentally unfair and ineffectual. The government ought to operate an advertisement campaign emphasizing that it is a civic duty to use social housing responsibly and that people should volunteer to come forward if they feel they are under-occupying their council house. People doing so should be rewarded by being put at the top of the list for family-size-appropriate housing in a location of their choosing. This tactic is a positive action that will appeal to people's aspirational side. It will be perceived as an opportunity, not a punishment, and people will be able to improve their welfare whilst feeling like good citizens at the same time.

I think this policy would most appeal to elderly people on estates whose kids have long gone and left empty rooms behind. They will look to move into towns because it will improve their mobility and give them more places to go to spend their retirement. Where one person in a social circle volunteers to move, their friends might do the same. I of course can't make any numerical predictions because I don't have any data, but I would imagine that a lot of under-occupied housing is empty for precisely that reason - elderly people whose kids moved out, and it is young families who need social housing desperately at the moment.

The government needs to read more about psychology. Punitive actions rarely motivate anyone to do anything.

Good thought.  My POV is that the Tardis exists multidimensionally and might be capable of a lot more than the Time Lords ever suspected.  So, for example, we see in The Doctor's Wife that time doesn't mean much to the Tardis as it perceives everything as happening more or less at once (like Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, probably).  It might also perceive the various facets of it's own existence, so as a real object in one place but as a fictional object in others, or as a potential object elsewhere.

Part of being an Arsenal/Spurs fan is hating each other.

It's a bit of a ""damned if you do"" ""damned if you don't"" with football rivalries.

If you talk a lot about the hate you have for Spurs, you are deemed ""obsessed"", however if you are nice and respectful you are deemed a ""casual, plastic fan"".

However our subs seem to have this feeling of not wanting to look ""obsessed"". However if you take a look at many other forums of our clubs you see a lot of ""obsession"".

Take a look at [this thread] (http://www.thefightingcock.co.uk/forum/threads/come-here-to-laugh-at-gooners.884/page-232) from thefightingcock.com.

and take a look at [this thread] (http://arsenal-mania.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=49821&amp;start=2280) from Arsenal-Mania.com.

As you can see, they talk/laugh/discuss about each others clubs to non end. They feel no pressure of looking ""obsessed"", however over here we are scared of other fans ease dropping on our subs and laughing at us.

The majority of our internet fans do ""obsess"" about each other, however it is different on Reddit.

Lately, around here it has started to get a bit sterile.  Influx of new fans seems to have diluted the culture a bit.  It's exactly the challenge we'll be having with signing all of these new players at once.  Bringing one player in at a time, they are exposed to the club's culture and adopt it as their own.  Bring 7 in at a time and maybe they re-define the culture themselves.   

I think there is a place for banter here, and even some all-out trash talking, etc.  on derby day.   Tomorrow we move on, but today it's fair game.  Keep it on **our** sub, stay out of theirs.  (Well, a good lurk from time to time to enjoy the Arsenal tears never hurt anyone)

true,bcash,null,null,"This is very interesting, for two reasons:

One, the obvious continuation of the NSA/GCHQ snooping saga.

But also, two, as it gives glimpses into the powers of the spying agencies have for breaking encryption.  Politicians have hinted many times that the right people can break any encryption if they wanted to, but as far as the best civilian cryptographers know this is bollocks.  But, on the other hand, it would be surprising if top spy agencies hadn't got some techniques that weren't known in the civilian world.

Usually these statements are in connection with police investigations, but for the Miranda documents you can be sure the best of GCHQ (and probably the NSA) are on the case, and as such we're witnessing state-of-the-art cryptanalysis.

But still those statements are alarmingly weasle-worded.  Alarming in the sense they're borderline lies, which given the fact they were made to a court-of-law opens the prospect that our own government is purguring itself with impunity.

Reading between the lines it seems as though GCHQ has no shortcut for TrueCrypt files, at least, because the nature of such a system would mean that if they had they would have had instant access to the entire volume.  The gradual step-by-step technique hinted at in the statement suggest they have no means of attack against TrueCrypt and are instead recovering non-encrypted data from the file system.

Unless, of course, it's a double-bluff...

And yet when the actual vote result arrived, it seemed an awful lot closer than I'd imagined ... only 13 difference ?

Is there any way (akin to the US system), where you can actually see who voted ""yay"" and ""nay"" on this issue, to understand if their rhetoric during the debate was genuine, or just a way of appeasing their constituents before ignoring their wishes entirely and voting ""yes"" anyway ?

Are they *really* representing their constituents, and if so, how come the margin was so narrow ? Seems more like the usual 95% voting along party lines, with 5% dissenters who may have gone either way ? A democracy surely represents the will of the people ... and all the polls were showing a 75% against, 25% for sentiment ... and yet the final result was pretty much 50.5% against, 49.5% for.

But that still doesn't change the fact that it still costs more to build than a railway well over 50 times its size. The only reason it's going to cost so much is because the railway is running through private land. This includes large swathes of land owned by David Cameron's father-in-law, who is the eighth richest landowner in the country. 

The government builds the railway with the taxpayer's money, and *then* sells it off to a private company. This special little arrangement seems to have been designed to piss-off as wide a political spectrum of people as possible, as it incorporates the worse aspects of both left-wing and right-wing economics. It pisses-off the former as it is owned by a private enterprises as opposed to being nationalized (thus meaning a significantly smaller return-investment for the Government), and it pisses of the latter as the government still builds it out of money collected by high taxes, meaning that that one of greatest advantages of free-market capitalism is completely done away with.

Look for the fan shaped smoke streaks. There is very little light coming off of them, but a lot of smoke. The WP rounds are used to make smoke screens. Even despite the secondary incendiary effect, they are still not classed as an incendiary weapon. Using them against military targets is a completely valid use, even if it is only to clear out building to kill the enemy with high explosive (HE) rounds, which was done in Fallujah. 

The [Mark 77 bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_77_bomb) was also deployed in Iraq, the difference being that it is an incendiary weapon. It's use is still perfectly legal as long as certain rules are followed.

Here is the official document on what an incendiary device is and where it can be used (.pdf file) - http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/B409BC0DCFA0171CC12571DE005BC1DD/$file/PROTOCOL+III.pdf

Read carefully the part about what is and is not counted as an incendiary weapon. This next part is also important.

&gt;3. It is further prohibited to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by means of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered incendiary weapons, except when such military objective is clearly separated from the concentration of civilians and all feasible precautions are taken with a view to limiting the incendiary effects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. 

In Fallujah the enemy had taken over civilian buildings. This made them military buildings and also made it perfectly acceptable to attack them with incendiary devices as long as they knew that a large concentration of civilians were not near by. So even if WP rounds were classed as incendiary devices, it was perfectly legal to use them in an attack.

Now, I'm not denying people were killed or maimed by WP rounds, but the firing of them was legal, and those hurt, were done so by the secondary incendiary effect of a round that is not designed to cause death or injury through an incendiary effect.",0,1378044985,null,0,false,0,cbzldmm,t3_1lgy8o,t1_cbzldmm,t1_cbzkjyb,null,1429627109,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Unless the UK uni already has a study abroad relationship with your US uni, you can't just come for one term/semester and do a random course. You wouldn't get any credit or anything. I guess you could sit in in the lectures, but it would be pointless unless you really wanted to hear someone famous give a lecture.

Coutinho: pretty anonymous honestly aside from picking up a few free kicks

Aspas: was running everywhere, but had a lot of poor touches and looked over his head

Sturridge: fucking great game, held the ball up amazingly well in the last 15 minutes or so to let the rest of the team reshape

true,iamscully,lfc55,,"Mignolet - 8 - Handled everything magnificently, maybe a couple of crosses could have been dealt with better, but I love him. Fills me with confidence.

Johnson - 8 - What a tank! Kept running and running, was knocking players over when *he* had the ball, and got properly stuck in when he needed to. Hope he's okay.

AGGER - 9 - WHAT A BOSS. Assist for Sturridge, led the defence excellently, was an inspiration. Kept annoying van Persie as well, added bonus. Wonderful match from the Dane who usually starts the season poorly. :* love you Daniel.

SKRTEL - 9 - Don't sell him, man. Never wanted to sell him, and he looked really comfortable today. Last ditch tackles, blocks, etc. Properly committed. Didn't look that bad on the ball either, to be honest.

Enrique - 7 - Bit anonymous until the last few minutes where he was mopping up fruitless attacks down their right hand side. Solid from José.

Lucas - 7 - Good reading of the game as usual, kept the game ticking over nicely. He does mouth off at referees quite a bit - but against the Mancs I'm all for that (unless you're Javier Mascherano).

Gerrard - 8 - This fucking guy marshalled the team so well. He's such an inspiration. Didn't take any shit from van Persie, played some really nice football and fuck me if he didn't make some incredible challenges. Hope he keeps playing like this for another 10 years.

Henderson - 8 - This guy should be a future captain. He has so much drive and determination and passion for the game, exemplified by gut-busting runs out of the box in the 93rd minutes. He was always closing down, harrying defenders. Love Hendo.

Aspas - 4 - Oh dear. Could tell he was willing to get stuck in, but nothing ever went his way and he was rightly substituted off. 

Coutinho - 5.5 - Have to say United dealt with him very well, save for some meaty challenges from Cleverly, van Persie, and Giggs. Always has the potential to create something out of nothing, but meh for today. Lots of easy passes misplaced.

STURRIDGE - 9 - where the fuck is the sulky dude we were supposed to have signed? The one who didn't give a shit? The one who had really poor work ethic? Saw none of that today! Showed his predatory instinct with *another* goal, and was always available for the pass. His link-up play is severely underrated and he kept going right to the final whistle - on the wing and down the middle, he was everywhere. Bonus points for the lovely BR-Studge hug. Big kiss for Danny.

SUBS: Wisdom - 7 - Solid. Strong. Wisdom is tank.

Sterling - 6 - Looked *very* weak in the challenge, but on the counter he was dangerous. Nearly sealed the deal at the end, but I hope Sterling gets a little stronger.

This definition comes from black's law dictionary. It doesn't appear in statutes. I don't have a copy but according to wikipedia you missed out a part of the quote that doesn't support your point: ""a payment exacted by legislative authority"".

It seems odd that you define any reduction in a payment the government makes to anyone as a ""tax"". If the government reduced the subsidy it gives, say, to rail companies, or reduced the amount of money that is being lent to banks, that is not a ""tax"" and you're being disingenuous if you claim that reductions in payments are taxes.

Just admit that you want to call it a tax because it sounds better. It's far more honest.",0,1378046544,null,0,false,0,cbzlrb0,t3_1lic7y,t1_cbzlrb0,t1_cbzjku9,null,1429626932,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

My boyfriend, /u/offcrandy, made this Tardis polish rack for me for our anniversary (which is actually on September 25). He does custom wood flooring, so he built this project on the side :)

I posted the first stages of this project to /r/RedditLaqueristas a few days ago, where we already answered a few questions. Here are those common questions and answers again:

1. *Can I borrow this idea?* Yes, by all means!

2. *Can you make/sell me one?* He's mentioned maybe selling something like them in the future if it works well, but that would be a ways down the road. Not to mention, they would probably be a bit costly. The materials were around $150 or so - a little more, with paint. And he's spent a fair amount of time and labor on it. Plus, we don't know what it would cost to ship! So the answer is maybe, but probably not any time soon!

3. *Can I have the measurements?* Andy gave me some very general measurements to give to you, which you can find [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/1lb4yx/so_a_while_back_i_posted_pictures_in_this_sub_of/cbxq2pb).

I live somewhere in the 01726 area and personally I wouldn't go with Vodafone or O2 if I wanted a 3G signal most of the time. I am with EE but occasionally use a 3 mobile broadband dongle, and even when driving around streaming internet radio it's fine 99% of the time (Stenalees and that roundabout is a particularly bad blackspot).

The advantage of going with EE is that they have a better 2G backup than 3, it is more seamless (3 makes the phone lose all 3G signal before even considering moving to 2G, whereas with EE the phone can pick the best signal, and on 3 this will cause the phone call to drop if you're on the phone, on EE it doesn't).",0,1378049000,null,0,false,0,cbzmeg2,t3_1la58p,t1_cbzmeg2,t1_cbyz72i,null,1429626632,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sorry but no.  Weight for weight shit like frozen chips, sausages and burgers are cheaper than buying fresh.

Again, wrong.  We spent £30+ a week on gas alone in the winter, and between £20 and £30 on electric.  People at the bottom tend to have pre-payment meters, and also probably debt as well.  Unless you have an ethical supplier the price per unit is higher than paying quarterly.

&gt;I grew up in abject poverty where we all lived in one room in winter because that's all we could afford to heat.

Then I would expect a bit more compassion.  The things that you mention are happening to people right now.  Why do you think there has been a massive increase in food bank use?

For = 241 tory, 31 LD. Not a single Labour MP voted for the war

Against = 30 tory, 11 LD and 223 Labour

Sorry, but that doesn't look like a free conscience-based vote to me. It looks incredibly in alliance with ""official"" party lines. I refuse to believe that none of the Labour MPs thought the war was a good idea while 89% of conservatives did. They all have the same evidence and set of opinions and facts presented in front of them. I refuse to believe that their interpretation of the facts and evidence tied up almost perfectly to the desires of their party leaders.

Seems to me that it was more about Labour wanting to cause problems for the government. It's great that the opposition actually opposed something, but I don't think that's a triumph of democracy at all. This could just as easily have been the other way around.

They have to pay EE (whose 2G network they use) for everything their customers do, and it's very expensive for them compared to when you do it on their own network. So (if I remember correctly) they now stop you using the internet on EE's network (which, since it is 2G, isn't going to be great anyway). They hope that their own coverage is good enough so that you'll never need the 2G backup anyway.

On EE itself you'd have internet because they don't do that. 

Vodafone is very very expensive for what you get - a network with good 2G signal but almost bugger all 3G (unless you actually live in St Austell and never try to go to any of the villages, basically).

I'm thinking about going the other way. I don't mind the EE service but they aren't competitive when it comes to data. 3 have a SIM only  contract with unlimited data + tethering for £15 a month, and it is very very tempting.

I think this is the crux of our disagreement here. As the majority had fled, is it still a civilian centre, or has it become an ad hoc military position. Both sides have fair arguments as to what it should be classed as. The whole argument really depends on how close are any civilians and how accurate is the weapon. And it is something that we need a lot more information on to get to the bottom of.

Morally though, I do agree with you. I was shocked when I heard that incendiary weapons could still be used in a war, bar attacking oil refineries/shipments.

Also it was not a free conscience vote. Voting on foreign policy rarely is because it's not normally seen as an issue of moral importance. Only since Iraq and Afghanistan have we felt some moral weight but that doesn't get around the fact that traditionally and in the vast majority of the developed world, military action is not a conscience issue but normally just one for the leader and the leader alone. Now you can criticise this all you want (and I would join you) but I think you'll have a hard time trying to pin the blame on Cameron or the Conservatives of today specifically for the fact that it was a whipped vote. It always has been and uprooting long-standing tradition is not only something that our government is not brilliant at seeing through but also is something best done out of a crisis, with cool heads and with no urgency. 

Maybe making votes on military action (which themselves are rare) conscience votes is a constitutional change we will see in the next few years and I'd welcome it.

I am sure however, when the team starts to gel more, the even newer signings get involved that we will start to look more fluid and as a result more incisive and dangerous. At the minute I can predict where each pass is going, it is slow... and Arsenal can predict it too. Soldado will struggle because at the minute the service is poor.

For the job it needs to do, DU is the best material for it. Not many other materials will get sharper as they go through their intended target, usually heavily armoured vehicles or fortified buildings. Tungsten alloys have been tried and some do have the same self sharpening trait as DU. However, they have been found to be hugely more harmful than DU, as in 100% of the rat test subjects got cancer and died within weeks.

Again it's a problem of legality versus morality. Legally it's perfectly fine to use DU in a war zone. Morally I don't feel it is.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Most people in the West don't take their religions very literally anymore. My problem with Islam is that it is very explicitly intended to be read literally. All the passages in the Bible about stoning children can be ignored because the people who use the Bible have found loopholes around them. Most muslims in the East haven't. So when the Koran tells you to behead a homosexual if you see one, it's a lot more of a scary thing. 

There's a huge difference between the Islam which is found in the West and the the Islam found in the East. There's also huge differences in catholicism depending on where you find it. Catholics and Protestants in the UK and Europe tend to be relatively passive but if you compare them to South America or Africa you would be amazed how violent they can be and how literally they interpret their holy books. 

I don't think Islam is inherently bad. But I think that it is bad so long as its followers continue to read its scripture literally. In a liberal democracy every one is allowed to believe what they want. However when belief becomes a certain kind of action I think we have a problem. Anglicans, Catholics and Protestants in the UK will seldom if ever turn their beliefs into violent action. If the Catholic or Anglican Churches stepped up their language and started inciting violence then I think we might have to take action against them, which might be banning or censorship. It all depends on how literally people take the religion's message and whether we can expect them to act or not. Eastern Islam should be banned. Western Islam, from what I see, is mostly ok. It's pretty non violent from my experience and that means it is ok. So long as it can remain that way and not become more Eastern, then that's fine for me.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"On my trips to Scotland I've always got the impression that the seperatists are extremely vocal, but never the less a small-ish minority. Because reading the comments on /r/Scotland or on most Scotland related BBC news comments you'd think support for independence was in the 90%'s.

I would caution though that whilst I don't think the outcome of the referrendum will be pro-independence, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that the right series of events could lead to a big last minute swing for the independence campaign and a suprise outcome. The Scots seem to be (regardless of their views on independence) incredibly proud of their corner of the world and characteriscally patriotic, in a way that seems to have been discouraged in England (and even has racist connotations). If there is a percieved assualt on Scottish culture as part of the union campaign that could cause a massive shift towards the yes campaign.

I just hope we don't end up with a ~43 Yes/56 No percent outcome... because if we do then we'll no doubt get caught up in endless independence never-endums until eventually the SNP get the outcome they desire.

--------

On a side note, I suspect the referrendum itself has actually been very good for Scotland, not least because the threat of it has prevented a Tory government which would otherwise have very little to lose (politically) in Scotland, from allocating a larger share of ""austerity"" to that region... especially considering that Scotland recieves (rightly or wrongly) per capita slightly more spending than many other parts of the UK -- and accounts for just ~10% of the population, making it a pretty easy sell politically speaking to ammend downwards the allocation of funding to Scotland.

If the outcome of the referrendum is pro-union, I dare say if the Torys get elected in Westminster 8 months later (which itself seems unlikely) there could be fairly drastic funding changes as they will be well positioned to dish out some of their beloved ""austerity"", with few MPs to lose and the danger of the referrendum behind them.",0,1378053848,null,0,1378054305,0,cbznv5s,t3_1liq7m,t1_cbznv5s,t3_1liq7m,null,1429625879,40,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,40

&gt; According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, quoted in the documentary, white phosphorus is permitted for use as an illumination device and as a weapon with regard to heat energy, but not permitted as an offensive weapon with regard to its toxic chemical properties.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus_use_in_Iraq

&gt;On November 16, 2005, BBC News reported that an article published in the March–April 2005 issue of Field Artillery, a U.S. Army magazine, noted that white phosphorus had been used during the battle. According to the article written by a captain, a first lieutenant, and a sergeant, ""WP [White Phosphorus] proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes where we could not get effects on them with HE [High Explosives].

And can I say about your second paragraph - all possession and no end product is hardly a new phenomenon, is it? We were the same through the second half of last season. This is still Moyes' squad, and he's the one who put together a team that can't put the ball in the net. Over the last ten years we've averaged 51.2 goals per season.  Hardly prolific, but we still did well. We got into the Champions League with a -1 goal difference! Martinez has to work with what he's inherited, and with the different style he prefers to play, we have to be patient to see it click. Yeah, Kone looks like a bad signing who isn't the answer we need up front, but there's not a manager on the planet who hasn't spunked money away on a dud player.

We're not gonna get relegated this season, and anybody who seriously thinks the club is in trouble after *three games* wants their head looking at. In 2010 we didn't win until October, and we still finished 7th that season. And Martinez has a very similar track record to Everton when it comes to later-season pushes.

Ultimately what I think this comes down to is ""what should our expectations be?"" because I think some people need a reality check. 

We aren't one of the big boys. We won't be challenging for the league in the foreseeable future. We can't realistically *expect* to be winning any of the cups any time soon. We can certainly hope for that, but it's a monumentally difficult thing to actually pull off. I'm sure we all remember when Moyes got us to the final and we got definitively humbled by Chelsea.

I don't see why Martinez is apparently being subjected to tougher standards than Moyes was.

true,WillSpur,flair2,,"I posted my own thread but the spam filter isn't having it for some reason. So here is my thoughts from that:

- We were excited about the strength (physically) of our team, but we cannot play that midfield 3 and expect to provide much going forward. We should only ever play Paulinho/Dembele and Capoue/Sandro in a holding two that pivot and push between each other in the box to box role. The free'd space is where our creative player comes in (more on this below).


- We desperately needed some creativity, Eriksen should provide this. If we continue to play the three above, we will continue to lack this.

- The brief glimpse of Lamela looked promising, I like the look of him.

- Soldado didn't get to do much but no one should judge our striker that is lacking service.

- I think we missed Lennon, despite Townsends decent first half. 

- Lloris still reads the game like an open book, beautiful.

- Rose just looked...ok, I feel like he will improve as much as I slated him in the past.

- Sad to see Capoue off, looked like he was in a lot of pain. But we have Sandro to compensate.


- Here is my ideal squad of which I believe will be our strongest team once it has clicked. A 4-2-3-1 formation of:

Lloris; 

Walker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Rose; 

Capoue, Dembele/Paulinho; 

Townsend, Eriksen, Lamela; 

Soldado

- I placed Townsend on the left as I feel Lamela will provide more on the right (I know it's early days), and that Townsend is outperforming Chadli at the moment. Dembele and Paul are similar players and should compliment Sandro or Capoue, never a 3 of them though.

- Finally...we will be fine. We need time to assess our strongest line up and everyone to click. Just take a look at that formation and line up above and look how tasty it is.",0,1378055798,null,0,1378056083,0,cbzoi7n,t3_1livyl,t1_cbzoi7n,t3_1livyl,null,1429625580,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

£7m of extra earnings last year. Divided by 650 MPs it's only £11k each. And consider that a handful of them were earning huge amounts (Gordon brown accounted for £1.4m, another guy £750k, another guy £417k, another £315k). Take those away and you have £6k per MP, and I'm sure there are more high earners still bringing that average up. That pretty much shows that the average bog-standard MP is not earning anything significant outside of their main job and they aren't as corrupt as we all think.

It's fine to be skeptical and cynical but I think it's obvious that most MPs are trying to do the best they can in a system where you always have to compromise something somewhere and you always have to justify your position.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"Before the Daily Mail bashing begins in earnest ... is this map factually correct? 

Where did they get their stats from?

I'm not going to Google for every single one there, but I'll try a few random ones:

* **Mobility Scooters** (funny thing to be capital of) - reported by Daily Mail in 2012: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143307/Britain-mobility-scooter-capital-Europe-300-000-roads.html. 

Source is: ""300,000, according to the British Healthcare Trades Association. ""

* **STIs** (starting from the top) - I googled for this and got: http://fullfact.org/factchecks/sti_capital_europe_UK_london_gonorrheoa_chlamydia_syphilis-27785

Seems that London is the STI capital of Europe: “Generally people are more at risk in London than they are in wherever they were before. We're the STI capital of Europe.""

Conclusion was inconclusive and possibly skewed because: ""... could be largely due to its more effective STI diagnoses and reporting, rather than its disease-addled citizens.""

Article is a good read.

* **Speed Traps** (last in list) : reported by Telegraph in 2009 that ""Britain the speed camera capital of Europe""  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/5161532/Britain-the-speed-camera-capital-of-Europe.html

""The data, released by Transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick, shows that in 2007 there were 4,309 cameras, compared to only 1,571 in 2001.""

""And Britain also has the most cameras in Europe, according to speed camera alert system Wayfinder - Germany has 3,000, Italy fewer than 2,000 and France under 1,000. ""

true,BingoJabs,null,null,"A few thoughts.

We didn't deserve anything from the game. We barely created a chance. Arsenal weren't great but they were better than us and we have Hugo to thank for keeping us in the game.

I think we should all remember that leagues and cups are won by the best team, not the team that has spent the most money. It's great that we've bought so many promising players, but I felt embarrassed by Spurs fans laughing at how little Arsenal have spent - Arsenal have a good team. (If teams won trophies based on how much money they spent on expensive players then Newcastle would have won the league five times in the last 20 years.) Arsenal won't win the title but they have a very good chance at finishing above us again this year. They play good attacking football and they passed the ball better than us. 

Which brings us onto passing. I've been a Spurs fan my whole life and have seen a lot of Spurs teams come and go. This is a decent Spurs team, but we don't pass the ball well. At the moment our attacking play basically involves a winger or full-back running very fast to the by-line and whipping the ball in. Either that or Townsend/Paulinho has a shot from outside the area. There is very little attempt to actually exchange passes anywhere near the box and when we do it, we don't do it very well. When I think back just a few years to Berbatov/Keane and all the little interchanges of passes, it makes me quite nostalgic. Hopefully Erickson will help with that, and it would have been nice to see Holtby on the pitch as well. 

Soldado. Bless him. When we bought him, I kept hearing people talking about him being the 20-goal-a-season player we'd been crying out for. Except that we hadn't been crying out for that player. It's not like last season we created loads of chances but Defoe/Ade didn't finish them off; last season we didn't really create much, so we were dependent on Bale doing something magical. Very few of our goals last season were team goals - a lot of them were solo efforts from Bale or Defoe. There seems to be very little point in buying a striker like Soldado if you don't surround him with creative players.

I like AVB. I do. But there's no denying that he's changed the way we play in (my opinion) quite a negative way. We are a strong, powerful, fast team. We are set up not to lose, but there's very little creativity or joy in the team. We are set up hit teams fast on the break rather than passing our way through them. As a Spurs fan, I'd rather win ugly than lose playing pretty football, but losing playing ugly football is unforgivable. Three games and no goals from open play suggests that most Premier League teams are quite comfortable with our current attacking tactics. 

It's a shame the international break has arrived. It'd be nice to have another game soon to get the Arsenal game out of our system. Still, it gives us time to get the new players settled. Let's hope that all the money spent is worth it.

 Chadli needs to work on his decision making and final ball. He is young and could be a very good player in a year or two.

 Capoue looks a bit clumsy to be honest, he didn't seem to be able to keep his feet under him today. that being said I feel sorry for the guy, Worked hard and was very unlucky for Cazorla to fall on his leg like that.

 for some reason Defoe always scares me a little.

 Townsend and Rose are going to be very important to you guys in the next few years, I hope their development stalls;)

The Club can announce that it has reached agreement with Real Madrid for the transfer of Gareth Bale.

Gareth joined from Southampton in May 2007 and during his six years with the Club made 203 appearances, scoring 55 goals.

Chairman, Daniel Levy commented, ""Gareth was a player we had absolutely no intention of selling as we look to build for the future. He is a player whose career we have fostered and developed and he was only a year into his new four year contract. 

""Such has been the attention from Real Madrid and so great is Gareth's desire to join them, that we have taken the view that the player will not be sufficiently committed to our campaign in the current season.

""We have, therefore, with great reluctance, agreed to this sale and do so in the knowledge that we have an exceptionally strong squad to which we have added no fewer than seven top internationals. More importantly, we have an immense team spirit and a dressing room that is hungry for success. 

""We wish Gareth all the best in the future and he shall always be welcome at the Lane.""

GARETH BALE STATEMENT:

“I have had six very happy years at Tottenham but it’s the right time to say goodbye. We’ve had some special times together over the years and I’ve loved every minute of it.

“I would like to thank everyone at the Club, the Chairman, Board, staff, coaches and players – and most of all the fantastic fans who I hope will understand this amazing career opportunity.

“I am not sure there is ever a good time to leave a club where I felt settled and was playing the best football of my career to date. I know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams, but I can honestly say, this is my dream come true.

“I am well aware that I would not be at the level I am today were it not for firstly Southampton and then Spurs standing by me during some of the tougher times and affording me the environment and support they have.

“Tottenham will always be in my heart and I’m sure that this season will be a successful one for them. I am now looking forward to the next exciting chapter in my life, playing football for Real Madrid.""",0,1378059140,null,0,false,0,cbzplwi,t3_1lizlz,t1_cbzplwi,t3_1lizlz,null,1429625066,17,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,17

true,Nark2020,null,null,"&gt; In a strongly worded blog post, the actor and comedian lamented that the ""squeezed liberal finds himself in the position that he cannot criticise Islamofascism because it's somehow 'racist'"".

On the other hand,

I: 

'Islamofascism' is not a particularly accurate word. 

There have been Fascists who were Muslims (e.g. the [Ustase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e) in Croatia had a Muslim wing). But the various forms of political Islam around today don't self-identify as Fascist, and their ideology is actually strikingly different in many respects from Fascism proper. 

You don't have to be a Fascist to believe in achieving your aims through violence, or to believe that it's acceptable to treat people better or worse depending on their religion.

Now if I employ the term 'Islamofascism', as people have been doing, AFAIK, since the Iranian revolution, what I mean to say is that 'This Islamist group are as bad as Fascists'. Which, sure, in terms of violence, an Islamist group might be. 

But. The way the word is thrown around now unhelpfully obscures the differences in ideology and practice between a) Fascism proper and Islamism, and b) between different, often opposed, Islamist groups themselves. Salafis and Wahabis are not the same. Shi'ite groups and Sunni groups have different ideas. 

You'll notice that I'm not saying, 'Hey, no, Islamists aren't Fascists, they're alright!'. What I'm saying is that the term Islamofascist muddies the dialogue. 

II: 

I think if we're going to say that someone's position is 'racist', we need to be sure that we're not accusing someone, who doesn't, of actually believing in superior and inferior races.  

I also think we should probably get over this 'What I'm saying can't possibly be racist because I'm not explicitly advocating the theory that there are different races and some are superior to others' idea. 

Both of these are rhetorical 'shut-downs', if you know what I mean. 

III:

And a third point: Fry seems to be appealing to some third person, as if there were a discourse referee standing around; 'It's not fair ref, they're accusing me of racism'; I'd rather see him respond to a specific accusation of racism from a specific critic. That might be more interesting. TBH I also think he's trying to guilt-trip his critics into silence by casting them as enemies of free speech. Also this: 

&gt; He continued: ""It is a topsy-turvy smothering of debate and an Orwellian denial of free speech to declare that speaking out against violence will cause violence.""

Is blatantly untrue considering that many propaganda pieces used to promote violence used the violence of the enemy as the justification for violence against them. Just look at almost any WW2 propaganda poster. Not saying Fry is calling for violence, but no, the critique of violence can indeed be used to incite further violence.

Martinez loves the Barca/Spanish way, the tiki-taka, 4-6-0, bore teams to death, wear them down with possession, wait for a defence-splitting pass. Main problem being that, if you don't have the players that can actually pull it off (read Xavi/Iniesta/Messi), you can end up getting steamrolled or maybe eke out a 0-0. We've already been branded the draw specialists.

It'd be too easy to throw out stats on Wigan (see the [09](http://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/2009-2010/regular-season/r8926/)/[10](http://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/2010-2011/regular-season/r11930/)/[11](http://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/2011-2012/regular-season/r14829/)/[12](http://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/20122013/regular-season/r17950/) tables) but Martinez' defensive record is by far the most worrying aspect. This is the guy that presided over 8 second-half goals against Spurs 2 months into his Wigan tenure. Wasn't exactly 'Fortress D.W'.

&gt; If we aren't progressing, let him go.

Wigan had been gradually sinking since he took over. He was never able to better Bruce's 11th place finish. They never made it above 15th place in 4 years. The only upside being the FA Cup win, tainted by the ignominy of being the first club to win the cup *and* manage to get relegated.

Are we going to get relegated? Probably not. Should we get rid of him, or even consider it? No. He's a good, promising, young (40) manager with 4 years PL experience and he likes to play open, attractive (debatable), possession football. I would expect the phrase, 'Everton are always a hard team to break down' to fade into the archives pretty soon though.

We were spoiled by Moyes and we didn't have the financial clout to break into the top 4-5. I don't expect that to change (regardless of manager) unless we get bought out by some oligarch/magnate/very rich fan(s). As thejayarr mentioned, we're going to need to be more realistic about our expectations.

true,HealthAnxiety,null,null,"Hey! My wife and I just flew into London last Tuesday, and then took the train up to Edinburgh yesterday. We got into Heathrow at 11 AM and getting through customs took all of five minutes. I wouldn't say that was average, but it didn't seem bad at all. The London tube system (subway) was really easy and quick. We took the Stockwell train to Kings Cross and that only took about 16 minutes. Piccadilly does sound like a good line for you. Just make sure you don't have to transfer. Just listen to the announcements on the train. I think you'll be heading north toward Cockfosters.

Once you get to Kings Cross, it's a bit of a walk to the train lines. With your baggage, I'd recommend taking the elevators. We had a shitload of bags, and it still only took about 7-10 mins to get where we needed to be. Once you get to the train terminal (at Kings Cross), just look at the boards for which platform you need (there were about 11). Our train didn't say which platform it was until it started boarding, but it only took a minute to walk there. Just a note, we had six bags total, and were worried we'd have to check them. The attendant said not to worry, that there was plenty of space on the train. She was right, and we easily fit our two massive American suitcases, big backpacks, and smaller backpacks.

Then it was an easy, pretty ride all the way up. The bathrooms on the train were clean and nice enough, and the whole trip took about 5 hours.

When you get to Edinburgh, there'll be a line of taxis. We were sort of sick of travelling and just wanted to take one to our temporary homestay, but they didn't take Visa cards so we walked up to Princes Street where we saw buses and lots of people. We hopped on the bus, having found the right route just by looking at the poster at the stop, and paid 3.50 pound each for a day pass. Much better than like 15 pound for a taxi! We've been here just two days, and it's beautiful/chilly. 

PM me if you need more info, or would like any help. I suggest Giffgaff for mobile. Cheap and free calls and texts between Giffgaff users. My wife has an iPhone and it was 12 pound for unlimited internet on the phone each month, plus hundreds and minutes and texts. Right now we have no friends, so just with texting each other, it's free. I just got the cheap plan to go with my cheap phone.

I'm not sure now.  It seems that everyone in here disagrees, not sure if that's a response to the loss from fellow Spurs fans, or the amount of scum in this particular thread.  I was watching it with an Arsenal fan who mentioned it late in the first half, so we all started paying attention to him, and I thought he was terrible.  Every time he touched the ball it seemed he gave it up, misplaced a pass, or tripped over his own feet.  Every time a white shirt was fouled, Santi was responsible.  He, my Chelsea supporting roommate, and I are all discussing how he was their best player last season.  Then, he loses the ball to Capoue; Capoue turns to push play in the other direction, and Santi just fell on him.  It was really strange.  

&gt;He was 10x better than any creative midfielder that Spurs fielded. Did you even field one?

No.  :(  Holtby is not quite match fit, AVB doesn't really seem to trust Siggurdson, and Eriksen's not ready.  Looked like the plan was to pack the midfield with size and exploit the wings.

1. Ball movement went from fantastic to pathetic. 

It was almost a bad joke at the end when you knew that Rose would somehow not accomplish whatever it was he was trying to do.

2. Chadli should not take a corner for a good long while. Unless the straight beam into the opposition is a tactic that I'm not aware of, he has some of the worst corners I've ever seen. 

3. Why on earth did AVB send in Defoe? The issue was never having someone who could make a good shot, the issue was having someone who could open up the field to the shooters. Holtby or Siggy would have made way more sense. 

4. As much as I love seeing Jan push forward with the ball, he was caught too often out of position when we inevitably turned the ball over. 

5. Putting in Lamela was most definitely a desperation move. Unless AVB is playing mind games and he wants Lamela to have the sour taste of defeat in his mouth, it was clear AVB was looking for an offensive spark... If you add Lamela, keep in Townsend and move him to the other side. Still could have used Siggy or Holtby in the middle. 

6. In the end, this game doesn't mean a whole lot. The team we saw today is not going to be the same team we see in a month. Arsenal is a well established team that has been playing together for years, at home, already with their backs against the wall because of a massive slip up against AV. Tottenham is basically a group of players who have yet to play, with some of their best players sitting on the bench. Which leads to 7

7. Arsenal fans really are massive cunts. I live in Texas and it's like every douchebag I have ever known is a fan of Arsenal. The only reason this game matter to me at all is because of the level of dumbassery I have to endure. I get that not everyone is but really, go to /r/gunners and go through some of their comment history on non football related threads.

We were 12 points off 4th place last season, so if we want to get top four, we should be aiming to get at least 12 more points this season.

To make up 12 points (at least) over 38 matches, we need to improve on our results from last season by 1 point every ~3 matches, on average. So far, we have improved by 5 points from the 3 corresponding fixtures we've played.

Last season, we only got 11 points from these next 6 fixtures. (Replacing QPR with Crystal Palace.)

Obviously winning all of them would be amazing. But... even if we drop up to 6 points from these fixtures, we still will have improved on the corresponding results from last year.

Since 28kbit/s conveniently Segways gracefully into the V.34 (09/94) recommendation, this minimum requirement is met by dial-up services. The biggest losers from dropping dial-up will be security alarms and other things like that.

It's a bit odd that BT are dropping dial-up in this way, as it means their service obligation (one suspects) will be met by their Plusnet subsidiary.

I haven't seen them. Maybe it's because I spend more time in /r/Scotland than in /r/unitedkingdom, and the former is quite pro-independence (probably because people who consider themselves Scottish are more likely to want Scotland to have full control of its own affairs).

This one bothers me though:

&gt;The will of the Scottish people must be respected, unless they vote against independence, in which case we'll try again in a few years

Votes aren't necessarily final. There's no reason that, if a referendum results in a No and opinion changes later, you can't re-run a referendum. Of course, in the event of a Yes, you can't re-run it unless you're asking ""Should Scotland re-join the United Kingdom?"" or something.

Also:

&gt;Fingers in ears Braveheart mode

I don't think any Scots would take that film seriously.

And:

&gt;YouGov is run by English pigs

Has anyone here actually claimed that?

Mind you, personally, I have no objection to English people running polls. Mind you, Scots living in England, and apparently also English people living in Scotland, are more likely to have a pro-Union bias.

Finally:

&gt;There's a long way to go yet - 1

Well, that's actually true. The main campaigns aren't going to start properly until 6 weeks before the referendum itself. There may also be all sorts of events in the next year. Perhaps the UK government will be stupid.

Bonus:

&gt;Alex Salmond didn't set the poll

Again, has anyone actually said anything like that?

That being said, some people might have mentioned the thing that Salmond said about how opinion polls said the SNP wouldn't win in 2011, and they actually did.

Appreciated, developed, I think it's a combination of both. I definitely think the increase in playing time at Liverpool has made him a better player though.

As far as Roman / Torrres, I couldn't say one way or another. 

You could be right but we also didn't really have another option until Ba was purchased (Even when Drogba overlapped with Torres he only scored 11 and 5 goals in the league). AVB saw him as a winger, Di Matteo wanted to use old guard players more (or it least I got that impression), and Benitez seemed to think he could resuscitate Torres' form to which he did to some extent. 

Again, glad to see him finding his groove. Good for England.

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"There are two main bits of advice to take home from contemporary wisdom concerning domestic finances.

1) Consume modestly; don't have Sky/Cable TV, cook meals from scratch and don't try to keep up with the Jones'. The money you don't spend should be saved ready for when you need it.

2) When you do spend money beyond your modest and humble physical needs, spend the money on experiences rather than 'things'.

When you can be satisfied with simple domestic living arrangements, you are more free than 99% of the other adults in the world. Once you've got a bit of money behind you, you can tell your manager to get fucked and laugh as you walk out the door. When you live simply, both you and your partner will be able to afford to take a leave of absence from work to raise your newborn for twelve months. When your finances are simple, you never have to worry about 'making rent' or paying that bill.

* Coutinho really needs to learn how to pace himself. Every game he comes out the blocks like a gun. Chasing everyone down, running all over being brilliant. Then as time goes on he gradually drifts out of the game and his workrate drops.

I think the first 'dial-up' Internet gateway service was offered by Pipex in the early 90s. Before then point-to-point sessions were established using acoustic couplers. You'd literally put a telephone handset into this coupler that would listen for and generate a frequency-shifted tones.

The idea in the story is that the cycle of mutation has come full circle for the Thals, because their survival has depended on them abandoning any thought of war to concentrate on being farmers.

Thinking about it, The Doctor might actually be the person who sends the Thal survivors packing.  I think he does something like that in Genesis of The Daleks.

I wasn't a direct part of it myself but the hooligan parts of the film are realistic, If I remember right some of the extras in FF were real or ex-hooligans. It used to be worse in the 80's with much of the fighting happening in stadiums compared to what's depicted in FF. I think some of it is explained in the film but because the police cracked down on hooligans and handed out banning orders it became more organised: two firms arranging a meeting place away from the police and media just to have a fight. I've read a couple books on it (Cass and Tottenham Massive) but with any of these autobiographies by criminals, gangsters etc they need to be taken with a pinch of salt.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"You are not well off. That £600 a month for food, transport, entertainment etc isn't a great deal of money. 

The £200 you have left a month you'll often find will be less than £200 as things come up week to week.. and on top of that month to month other things come up.

If I was assessing your finances (I'm required to do it for some people sometimes) I'd say you had likely very little to no disposable income.

If you were living with parents then that £200 would be fine, but if you're running a household then it quickly vanishes.

My advice to you would be to save money at every opportunity, and try to get up to at least £1K in a savings account in case something unexpected comes... as it will come often enough.

People invariably budget and forget the plethora of little or mid sized expenses that come up. It's not a failing, and it doesn't mean you're a crap adult, it's just life.

I'm not sure how much your repayments are on that £3,500. I'm going to guess it's around £100, or more. As soon as you have that paid off you will effectively get a £100 a month pay rise, that can sometimes help as inspiration to save money.

true,nasher168,eu,Hull,"My email (not letter, oops):

Dear David Davis,

I am writing to you regarding David Cameron's recent proposal that an opt-out internet porn block be placed on all households in the country, and his threats of legislation if ISP companies refuse to comply.

You are unquestionably a highly respectable and principled man, as evidenced by your resignation and re-election in 2008 which at the time drew considerable attention to the erosion of civil liberties in the UK. The proposals set out by your party leader are precisely the kind of erosion of civil liberties you encouraged us to be vigilant of. Though I do not expect (despite rumbling from the more hysterical commentators) that the current government will go any further than this opt-out system, I do not necessarily trust future governments not to expand on this, introducing ever more restrictive and obtrusive internet regulations. The internet is the single most important advancement of the late 20th century, and it became such through negligible government interference. Now is the time to act, and nip this in the bud. As an MP of the Conservative Party, you are in a particularly well-placed position to undermine these proposals, and introduce an otherwise-absent voice of reason to this debate.

These measures will do nothing whatsoever to prevent teenagers accessing pornography, since any teenager with even a basic competency with a computer will undoubtedly circumvent within minutes the blocks an ISP could place on internet access through the use of proxy websites, which link to web addresses via servers untouched by the government blocks. As some in the media have already pointed out, all this will do is lull parents into thinking their children can't do these things.

Mr Cameron's proposals are nothing more than an intrusion from government where it is neither needed or useful. It appears to be an attempt at pushing his own morality with regard to teenagers accessing pornography onto the general population. An ironic state of affairs, given the Conservative Party's historical tendency to oppose such big-government interference.

Restrictions on their families' access to the internet must rest firmly with parents, and with no one else. Doubtless these new guidelines will serve to drive up the cost of internet subscription fees, and it seems wrong to me as a consumer that I ought to be forced to pay for something I fundamentally disagree with simply because the Prime Minister has seemingly acquired a new pet project.

And all this is to say nothing of the security concerns associated with these measures. Indeed, in the last 48 hours it has come to media attention that the company Huwawei (which, despite their claims to the contrary, is closely associated with the immoral and totalitarian Chinese government) is responsible for the opt-out blocks offered by ISP company TalkTalk. Even with all blocks turned off, it has been shown that browsing information from TalkTalk users is sent through Huwawei's own computers-a worrying prospect indeed! It is possible that other ISP companies may use Huwawei in order to enforce the new proposals; a situation that would compromise the security of millions of internet users nationwide.

As a voter from a largely Conservative family background, I urge you to oppose these measures as energetically as you can. I am not so simplistic that this is the sole issue on which I will decide which party I vote for at the next election, but it will certainly influence my choice quite heavily.

As a champion of civil liberties this is, as it were, your battle.",0,1378075505,null,0,false,0,cbzutzd,t3_1ljieq,t1_cbzutzd,t3_1ljieq,null,1429622628,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

One of the guests partners turned out to be a South African chef so that sorted out the BBQ to a professional level, the weather was good and all the kids went feral at the end of the garden leaving the adults to get slowly pickled during the afternoon.  

Fast forward to about 9pm and the kids, who should have been asleep in their tents by this time, launched a ""cake raid"" from the top of the garden. This was unfortunately lead by a 7 year old mini Dwair in his pants.  Only his pants. One pair was worn normally, one pair on his head and another pair tied to the end of a broom stick whilst screaming ""I am the king of pants"" in the gloom and waist high grass.  His gang of mini hooligans then looted the kitchen and made off back into the dark whilst the adults sat just sat there slack jawed, gaping at one of the most surreal spectacles I have seen for a while.

By 2 am nearly everybody had fallen asleep apart from myself, Mrs Dwair's brother and Mrs Dwair who by then was waging war on the last wine box and ranting drunkenly on a comedy forum she frequents.

Today, the house and garden remain a mess, the dogs have devoured all the left overs and Mrs Dwair has been complaining that the quiche she ate at 3 am must have gone off off because it made her a bit sick in the night.

Bin Laden was also politically motivated, using the language of religion to put his message across.

And jesus, in the same fucking Willian example, how do you think there was press that Liverpool were interested? Could it have possibly come straight from the club? Maybe even repeatedly? Christ this is just two examples directly related to what we're talking about. I can't even keep up with the sarcasm, do you actually follow football? Teams state interest officially *all the time*. And your team *just did this*. Your comment is not only stupidly wrong, but you try to question my knowledge? Jesus fuck man, classic internet comment, good job.

PS: More examples that rapidly come to mind as I spend .01 milliseconds thinking about it ... Bale to RM? Suarez to Arsenal?

true,godismanen,flair3,,"First of all, the notion that I actually thought I could approximate Bale's thought process, or more significantly why I would have bothered to when his motivation's are so obviously as you suggest contrary to mine, is I would agree ridiculous. Fortunately I was trying to do nothing of the sort. I was responding to a claim that given the exact situation Bale was in, *I, myself, me (not Bale)* would have done exactly the same thing as Bale necessarily. The assumption that is a concomitant of this is that Madrid necessarily has more to offer than Spurs, which might be the case in terms of the money they can offer him or trophies but they absolutely cannot offer him wealth in any capacity that is actually meaningful to me, which is to say (as I have said) that they cannot offer him the comfortable work environs which I desire, they cannot offer him a cordial (bordering on friendly) relationship with his boss, as well as an excellent and arguably unique relationship with his fans, nor a culture to which I feel suitable (not Spain in general but specifically Madrid and especially the Real Madrid fanbase with their sense of entitlement). You see, in order for me to contest your absurd claim that I would have done the same thing in Bale's position I must employ my own principles and attempt to apply them to Bale's position. Almost by definition my position will be as you say ""biased"" (I prefer to say that I am just being a human being, since you have to be a pretty boring person not to have a skew on something so close to your heart as a football club), however then you suggest that because I am biased my position is invalidated entirely? So effectively *under your terms* (which are imo intellectually disreputable) there are no conditions under which I can dispute your claim. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, as they say.

Outside of this argument, let's address independently whether it is a waste of time to put yourself in Gaz's position. Well, if you think the goal of putting yourself in his position, or at least trying, is to produce an exact replica of the way his brain works, as you suggest, then yeah you might find it a waste of time, which is reasonable. But again, as I said earlier, that isn't the point of putting yourself in his position, at least not necessarily. The goal of putting yourself in his position in this context is to see what we ourselves would do. Your original claim supports this perspective of the function of the claim (redundant I know but I have to hammer this home): you yourself put yourself in his position to suggest that every other person would do the same thing in his position. Whether or not we can actually be in his position is in my opinion irrelevant because it doesn't have any actual applications for us; what we are trying to consider is what we would have done with similar options. In my opinion most of the fans on here and r/soccer are arguing that they would have done the same thing in Gaz's position because they support club's that challenge for trophies and view victory as the measure of success in football. We are talking about people who made conscious choices to support relatively successful clubs. Fair play, you didn't actually say you were objective, but you might as well have said so since the scope of your ideology in terms of defining success is limited not to fostering relationships between people but wealth and temporal victory like trophies and you take that as a given necessary condition of humanity. It's an implicit claim to objectivity, I would compare it to when the governor of my home state Michigan, made a claim that he was going to govern the distribution of wolf hunting licenses according to scientific principles, when in reality ""scientific principles"" were a totally ideological panel appointed by himself that was masquerading under the banner of scientific integrity and objectivity. The whole core of your original claim relies upon the assumption that human motivation is some kind of positive thing that we can determine through logical argument, which is basically a (false) claim to objective knowledge of human behavior.

2. Blink

If we talk about mainstream acts, the majority of their income comes from touring and merchandise. Hardly anything is made on CD sales for the artist (usually just a few pence per CD). 

For smaller acts and those just starting up, firstly it's usually impossible to find their music on torrent sites. Secondly, if the internet has taught us anything, it's that it is good for new music. Thirdly, sometimes it's difficult to purchase new music due to a lack of international distribution or limited editon pressings of singles/EPs/albums for example. If the music is available to download then people will download it and then when said artist comes to their part of the world, they see them live and buy the music directly from the artist.

Many people have made it due to the internet, Lilly Allen and Artic Monkeys to name but two. In fact, Lilly Allen gave away her music before she made it big on her Myspace page. 

Torrenting music will never affect the industry in the way the record companies would have us believe.

It reminds me of when I was a manager and I had this great girl working for me.

People being off sick was a pain as it meant I had more work to do (head office being tight in not paying for cover) and I would end up leaving work 4 or more hours later than normal and not getting paid for it. 

I remember feeling a tiny bit miffed that she'd lied about the sick day but I really had no ill feelings. I couldn't offer the money nor career progression she wanted and she had to look after number 1 and do what was right for her and her family.

I've done a fair bit of homework and on the council house sell-off, not to mention giving it a deal of thought myself - if it were about buying votes she could have allowed councils to replenish stock.

The sell off was about the principle that government shouldn't be involved in the building of housing, and the principle that more people should be able to own their own homes.

Whilst I might be inclined to agree with you that there were elements of vote-buying in this, I don't think that's where the idea came from.

The massive discounts granted to buyers were justified by the idea ""people have been paying rent for all these years and have nothing to show for it"". This does make some sense, I guess, if you see this from the view that you're selling them the property in a desire to rid yourself of the asset.

Honestly, I think it just shows how stupid and short-termist Thatcher actually was. By which I mean: sure, she had a degree in chemistry and invented whippy ice-cream, but that doesn't make her a great thinker. You don't need to be a great thinker to win the popularity contest that is a general election.

None of us can foresee all the consequences that a decision made today will have 20 or 30 years down the line, but this was a massive national asset that was transferred to private hands. I guess the idea was that ""it already belonged to the people"", but the state was entrusted with the care - I'm more inclined to the view that the sell off was careless, and ideologically-driven, than actually so petty as to be vote-buying at heart (although no doubt the tories of the time wallowed in this delicious side-effect).

Thatcher showed her lack of deep political and economic understanding in a number of ways. She valued GDP over wealth equality - the latter fell under her leadership, as did social mobility.

It only seems like when the team realizes they NEED to score SOON that they get off their asses and start pumping it upfield. Hopefully Gibbo's return will help with that.
 Fellaini needs to go higher up the pitch. I don't care if he likes playing in a deeper position, he's utterly useless that far back. We need him in that box to terrorize defenses. 
Mirallas.... *sigh*, just needs to play how he knows he can play, regardless of the system we're using.

He will mature, but I think at present we desperately need players who have his level of confidence and courage, as opposed to the more conservative, slower play our midfield is currently playing at.  Once everything else clicks into place, we'll have a team that can create chances in the box as well as shoot from range, and that will mean we'll become more versatile and unpredictable.

After all, there were plenty of times Bale shot last season when he probably ""shouldn't"" have.  Townsend's not in his class yet, but he's arguably a better player now than Bale was at his age.

#3. Give him time. Fluidity comes completely with squad integration. As the lads start training together, they will learn each others preferences and tendencies. A perfect example of this is Holtby: last winter when we bought him, he was playing like shit for us, and was dropped. Now after having an offseason under his belt, he's much improved in the squad.

#4. Refer to #3. But I would say the last two outings(Dinamo and Arsenal) I have thought Defoe has given us more.

I fucking love this photo.  The quarterback of my favorite (American) football team got crucified by our blowhard media because he confronted players from the other team who had been talking shit the whole game. 

It's kinda funny, it's like no one in our country played a sport themselves and realizes that the shit talking is a part of it.  Sometimes you have to confront an asshole.

The list I linked to uses any interaction with the Doctor as qualifying, regardless of how long it was. You may debate its merit as you feel like, investigate it for yourself.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Perhaps in a window or so down the line they'll say we made that big game changing signing, but if you look purely at the core of our club, these last two windows have been unbelievable (assuming the additions of Sahko and Ilori).

Right now we've got a keeper, who looks the part, who could be here for a decade. Certainly enough time for us to reach CL and start pushing up. 

We've brought in, potentially, two centerbacks who could be here 5 years plus. If you'd told me two years ago we were signing Sahko, I'd have lost my shit. The man is immense and will be. Its only because PSG have become the City of Ligue 1 that he isn't in his proper place. This guy could be a starter for France for years to come. Ilori, although unproven, also looks to be an option that really could set us apart. A tall and quick CB is so rare in the Prem but so necessary to cope with the demands of the league. Lets hope he makes a smooth transition in. And who could forget our free be, but perhaps most important to stabilizing us right now...KOLO TOURE. Who would've thought when we signed him that we would end up being fine without another CB signing. Sakho is one for now and for the future, but we were doing alright with Kolo.

Cissokho and Moses, although both perhaps only temporary members of our club, are exactly the type of loan deals a club in our position needs and loves. We've brought in proven players who can add experience and a desire to prove themselves. I'm really happy with the Moses addition and I hope he comes in and shows some hunger. I think our fans will breathe a sign of relief at having missed out on some of these lads we're linked with, and Moses has allowed us to wait until we can secure targets that match our ambition, versus getting stopgaps to inch us up the table.

As far as Alberto and Aspas, what can be said? Alberto certainly seems to have enough about him to be an option off the bench for Coutinho in the coming years, until he might establish himself in the first 11. He isn't as tricky a dribbler, but he's got an eye for a pass, and I think he will surprise us throughout the season. Aspas isn't going to set the world alight. He may not even be a consistent starter. But he's got the desire you want from a front man, he's smart, can move into channels and has an eye for a pass (which wasn't something we'd know from his Celta Vigo days where he was rarely asked to pass). I can see him going on to have the occasional great day against sides where we need to give our top players a rest. 


And then, from the January window, players who are quickly becoming icons, Sturridge and Coutinho. Both pushing each other to earn the most plaudits.


These windows we haven't spent a huge amount. We won't have spent more than 20 million pounds on any one player. But we've brought in a nucleus of mostly young players who can help us improve as they do.


Its precisely this type of reality we need to convey to the footballing world, to gather the proper interest in our club from potential signings. Players want to be apart of a moment. They want to play for clubs who can match their ambitions.

However we got 20m or so for 3 guys in Carrol, Spearing and Shelvey that basically all had no or close to no play in league for us last year. 

I feel we have a strong shot at top 4 for a few reasons.

1. We had quite a bit of sub par minutes last year from guys no longer here in league fixtures. I feel we have likely replaced alot of them and that should give us quite a big boost. The teams ahead of us however had much more depth and while many signed big names, the minutes they are replacing were already a higher quality. thus they will get less benefit from those signs then many think.

2. Daniel and Philippe only played about a third of the PL mins they would in a full year. So long as they stay healthy that should be like having the impact of adding a top quality forward.

3. Luis and Daniel are among the top 5-8 strikers in the EPL

If my memory serves me correctly, neither give away anything significant or specific about the other show (I believe they mention what amounts to be the general premise of the other show, but not much beyond that).",0,1378100372,null,0,false,0,cc028q7,t3_1lk746,t1_cc028q7,t3_1lk746,null,1429619099,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,discopowerpack,lfc99,,"&gt; Luis and Daniel are among the top 5-8 strikers in the EPL

Who are the 5 better than them? I can't think of any stiker in better form than Sturridge, and Luis was the best striker last season. Only Van Persie comes to mind, but fuck that guy.

EDIT:

I think Liverpool has the best attack out of the top tier teams.

Chelsea: Starting a winger as forward ahead of Torres, Ba, and Lukaku. Forwards yet to find consistent form.

Tottenham: Soldado is yet to prove himself. So far has only scored penalties.

Arsenal: Giroud seems to be in good goal scoring form, pairing nicely with Walcott, who also cuts into the center at times. Better than Sturridge and Coutinho's interplay? Possibly.

ManU: Van Persie is dangerous. Rooney playing behind him is scary, even though he prefers the limelight of striker over playmaking forward, he still plays with all his effort, his long passing and runs are pretty damn good, but he wants to leave the club. Hopefully he'll keep bitching and their team will start to hate each other. Also Moyes first season will be rocky. ManU's player and manager issues will see their quality players not performing.

ManCity: These guys are fucked. That loss at Cardiff won't happen again. These players, like all of Tottenham's signing, will gel better with every game, and will be tough to defend against. Not to mention the depth in their squad. Dzeko seems like a improved player under Pellegrini after not being rated by Mancini. Aguero is nippy and awesome, and their new signing Negredo is playing how Soldado should be playing - big, strong, winning headers, and looks like he could fire in a powerful drive given space around the box. He also just looks like he'd stab you.

Compared to other teams, I'd say ManU and ManCity are the only teams with possibly better strikers, but Liv are similar quality and in better form.",0,1378100399,null,0,1378102026,0,cc028yq,t3_1lk5nd,t1_cc028yq,t1_cc020si,null,1429619096,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

Mourinho's first 2 seasons at Chelsea were different again, but in parts of the attacking style now we are similar. Mourinho relied on very very quick wide forwards who would direct the play from central midfielders on the counter and then very quick #10 and #9 playing in the middle. His last season at Real Madrid was similar in that way.

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"&gt;What about the American's use of depleted uranium for bombs? It's produced a myriad of birth defects and abnormally high cancer rates. Surely that qualifies as a WMD or is that also legal?

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium#Military_applications

&gt;Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19,050 kg/m³, it is 1.67 times as dense as lead, only slightly less dense than tungsten and gold, and 84% as dense as osmium or iridium, which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Consequently a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile, with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectile ordnance is often inherently incendiary because of its pyrophoric property.

DU isn't used in bombs anymore since the mid 90's and it wasn't used for its toxicity but because it is very dense, very hard and pyrophoric it was designed to be shrapnel in bombs or in the case of nuclear bombs as a tamper to make the explosion more energetic. I am sure we would all remember DU being used in that instance. Another point is this, until recently we had almost no data on the effects of DU in vitro, we had a fair idea it is toxic because it is a heavy metal, but compared to other heavy metals it is not as nasty as them, but this is all relative of course. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium#Ammunition

&gt;According to 2005 research, at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions, such as tungsten-cobalt or tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys, also possess extreme carcinogenic properties, which by far exceed those (confirmed or suspected) of depleted uranium itself: 100% of rats implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal rhabdomyosarcoma within a few weeks.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Really, that's it? Just because you win? You honestly couldn't think of another reason? Downvote me if you want but here is an honest answer from someone who really fucking hates Chelsea. Sit down and have a listen. If not, move along.

Chelsea were a decent team before Roman Abramovich took over. Some close finishes, a few FA Cups, and I'm too lazy, tired, and a little inebriated on a few substances at the moment but I think there was a Cup Winners Cup somewhere in there. However they only win the league and challenge for European titles since 2003 is solely because of the money the team received from the devil incarnate. Compare it to how Manchester United, Liverpool, and others plied their trade for decades previously. Naturally, such a shift in how the financial side of football works was bound to piss off many especially when one understands how much better Chelsea was after the investment. I believe the club was even in heavy debt at the time of Roman's purchase so it's entirely possible that Chelsea could have pulled a Leeds Utd. instead of a Manchester City. Fuck it, compare it to what Aurelio De Laurentiis did with the club I support. That's how you properly improve a club with rich history instead of shitting on all it stood for. I laughed when Eden Hazard said it was his dream to play for Chelsea. Poppycock, he only joined for the money and the champions league. If Liverpool were in Chelsea's current situation he'd be at Anfield right now. 

Also your owner is an evil little cunt. The worst kind of human. Scum of the earth. Compare his deeds to those of Aurelio De Laurentiis, the owner of my club SSC Napoli. I'd rather my owner be responsible for shitty Italian movies or films starring Jude Law then my owner shitting in the face of human rights and common decency. He's a corrupt and generally abhorable human being. True there are many owners throughout the sport like Berlusconi, Qatari and Emirati slavers, and the owner of Wal-Mart whom we can all agree are evil human beings, but that doesn't wash away any sins. Fuck Roman. I will not lose an ounce of sleep when I hear of his passing. Instead of spending a billion euros on players, he should give that money to people whose lives he has no problem ruining. 

 Other supporters act like they've been following for decades, that they love Chelsea because it was a match made in heaven and probably have no fucking idea where the Carefree motto came from. The newer supporters love shitting on people who support less than successful clubs when they've only been following the Blues for a few years. Lastly it's because some of their supporters say things like ""They only hate us because we win"" and ignore the previous facts that I have presented.

Do I hate you for being Napoli in the knockout rounds? Not really. Chelsea outperformed us at the Bridge. I would say that Napoli should have won, but we lost in the most fair manner possible. Actually kind of impressed me. Also it meant that Barcelona lost eventually and those cocky little shits were overdue for a loss. Colo(u)r me a conspiracy theorist but that was some UEFAlona shit a few years ago. It was great seeing Chelsea lose but I'd rather it was because they were shit like last year in the Champions League and not because some referee was incompetent. 

I forgot what I was ranting about so I'll just shut up and laugh at the responses I'm most likely going to receive throughout the next few days.

Welcome to Brum. What part are you moving to, the bus system in Birmingham is ok and the trains are reasonably reliable so if you're on public transport you'll be fine. On to things to do:


City Centre Places to visit:

1. [The Library of Birmingham](http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/):This is opening tomorrow after a move from the old Central Library at Paradise Forum. I'm looking forward to poking my nose round and the Shakespeare room looks amazing.
2. [BMAG](http://www.bmag.org.uk/birmingham-museum/):The Main Museum by Victoria Square is a great place to go to, it has the largest collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings in the world and the Staffordshire hoard too. The newly opened [Birmingham Exhibit](http://www.bmag.org.uk/new-birmingham-history-galleries) is definitely worth a wander around and will give you a background on your new adoptive city.
3. [Thinktank](http://www.thinktank.ac/): At Millennium Point is a great interactive science display to go and see (tailored more towards kids but still fun for adults too!).
4. [The Back to Backs](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/birmingham-back-to-backs/): The only National Trust place inside the city centre. A row of preserved 19th Century houses originally built for workers, definitely worth a visit.
5. [The Ikon Gallery](http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/) in Brindleyplace is the hub for more modern arts, but is free has a good cafe and a nice courtyard and definitely a good few hours worth of entertainment.
6. [The Sea Life Centre](http://www.visitsealife.com/birmingham/) round the corner from the Ikon is also a good place for a few hours, especially if you have little ones in tow.
7. And if you're a fan of chocolate there's of course [Cadbury World](http://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/). No need for an explanation here I think!
8. [The Electric Cinema](http://www.theelectric.co.uk/) is the UK's oldest working cinema (licenced bar too!). It shows a great eclectic mix of blockbusters, Indies and golden oldies.

Shopping

1. I See you're working at the BBC which is based in [the Mailbox](http://www.mailboxlife.com/). Plenty to see and do here. Many High End shops, and eateries (Pennyblacks is a particular favourite of mine). There's also a few hotels around if you end up staying late.
2. [The Markets](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/bullringmarkets) Are worth a visit if you're after, well, pretty much anything! Split into three main markets: [The Open Market](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Markets%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223092598418&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper) is the place to go for cheap fruit and veg shopping (early mornings are best), with a wide range of local and exotic fruit and veg. [The Rag Market](http://www.ragmarket.com/) Has a wide range of goods from fabrics, to electricals and general handy stuff. Finally, [The Indoor Market](http://www.bullringindoormarket.net/index.html) is the place to go for Meat, Fish and Exotic foods, with ample parking above it. There's an AMAZING little sushi place in there called [suishi Passion](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sushi-Passion/212584485422108) which I urge you to try.
3. The Big One... [The Bullring](http://www.bullring.co.uk/), which I'm sure you've probably heard of is the main shopping centre coming up to it's 10th Birthday. It's got over 160 shops including Selfridges, a mahoosive Debenhams, and a TK Maxx which I can never get the missus out of. Right next door to the currently being refurbished [New St Station](http://www.newstreetnewstart.co.uk/) (due to have it's own shopping centre and John Lewis within the next year or so). A new eating development has just been added at the bottom of the Bullring called Spiceal Street, with a few nice restaurants and a Jamie's Italian which is worth a visit
4. [The Pavillions](http://www.pavilionsshopping.com/) situated next to the Bullring from the other side of Markets has a few good shops, a large Waterstones and a good food court upstairs if you ever get bored of the Bullring.

Dining Out and Drinking


1. Apart from the aforementioned Mailbox and Bullring

2. A short walk down the canal from the Mailbox is [Brindleyplace](http://www.brindleyplace.com/), opposite the ICC. Brindleyplace again is full of restaurants and bars (mostly chains; Pitcher &amp; Piano, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Handmade Burger Co., Cafe Rouge, Pizza Express, Carluccios, etc). Personally I recommend [Chilaccas](http://chilacas.co.uk/), great little burrito place open late, if you're on the way back from Broad Street.

3. Talking of [Broad Street](http://www.broadstreetbirmingham.com/). Birmingham's 'Premier' drinking location. Nice in the week but I avoid it like the plague on a weekend as It's usually full of Stag Do's, Hen Nights and Students who've had a few too many beers.

4. For an alternate drinking / shopping venue[The Custard factory](http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/), south of the City Centre in Digbeth is good. Plenty of vintage shops, eclectic bars, and the [Digbeth Dining Club](http://www.digbethdiningclub.co.uk/) on Fridays is a great place to meet people and enjoy some of Britain's best street food.

5. [Moseley](http://www.moseleycdt.com/) is described as an urban village. about 15 minutes by bus from the city centre it's basically Birmingham's version of Carnaby Street / Soho. Lots of independent shops, craft fairs and farmers markets. And a few great Pubs too. recommended are [The Prince of Wales](http://www.theprincemoseley.co.uk/), [The Bulls Head](http://bullsheadmoseley.co.uk/) and the [Fighting Cocks](http://www.thefightingcocksmoseley.co.uk/) are great pubs if you want to stay away from the chains.

6. Harborne, again about 15 mins bus ride is also great for a few ales, with some good bars, eateries and a few stand out pubs.

7. Around the city itself, there's a funky collection of Pubs and Bars called [Bitters'n'Twisted](http://www.bittersntwisted.co.uk/) Each is unique, The Victoria doing amazing soul food, The Jekyll and Hyde with a gin bar and film evenings, all worth a visit.

8. Chinatown and the [Arcadian](http://www.thearcadian.co.uk/) is great for food and there's a few funky restaurants and bars. [Le Truc](http://letruc.co.uk/) is a personal favourite.

Parks 

The two main parks in the city are:

1. [Sutton](http://www.sp.scnhs.org.uk/) is one of the largest parks in the UK, you could spend at least a few days exploring all nooks and crannies. 

2. [Cannon Hill](http://www.cannonhillpeoplespark.net/) is much smaller but no less exciting, there''s a boating lake, tennis courts, mini golf and events throughout the year. If you're up for a run there's a free 5k [Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/cannon-hill/) event every Saturday morning at 9am. Maybe see you there ;-) 

This is nowhere near an exhaustive list, at barely starts to cover all the independent, bars, clubs, and places to go. I find new things to see and do every month.

The problem isn't the players - I am confident that these new Spurs signings will prove in the next decade that they are all top quality players (if they make it at Spurs or not). The problem is creating a completely new side with completely new players in a completely new style. That always takes a year to iron out, look at the start of the Liverpool season last year.

Yes, AVB was there last year - but his project starts now. He learned from his experience at Chelsea and *blended * his new style in with new players over the course of a year rather than abruptly changing course.

Bale was never a die hard Spurs fan. He stated a freaking decade ago, long before he came to play for us, that his dream was to play for Madrid. His boyhood fantasy.

But he had to grow into that. He was a talented, if unremarkable, LB, someone who might fall through the ranks and drift off to wherever the numerous players who get into top tier football and then fall off go. But he didn't. He made his presence known at Southampton, and commanded a signing.

I don't think anybody back in 2007 was particularly ecstatic about it. I know I didn't think much - I thought it was a solid deal. 5 million for a talented young kid who would probably be a good addition.

That kid grew to command a record breaking transfer. And while we cultivated him as a player, it's not like he shortchanged us in return. That kid has payed Spurs back in spades.

So fuck you, fuck your ""judas"" talk. Bale has boosted and lifted this club in ways that his initial salary could never repay, and the rewards of his time here are not even remotely close to being shown - Shit, half our starting XI now are being payed by his transfer.

Bale was a keystone in tough times for Spurs. His leaving has facilitated the realization of his dream, since he first picked up a football, and breathed in an astounding amount of new life and talent into the club he's leaving.

He's not a Judas. He's a man realizing his dream. And we have not exactly been burned in the process. Fuck you and fuck that attitude.

true,James-Venn,null,null,"Ah,  about a year or so,  and around 120 watts.  For day to day living you only need lighting,  mobile phone and tablet,  none of which really dents your batteries (I've installed LED lighting etc). You can also run your laptop etc so everything you need for software dev. It also runs the shower so you really miss nothing.  I'm still using propane for cooking and hot water,  but only a bit,  and will be converting the engine to run on vegetable oil and then meddle with the alternator to basically turn my engine into a vegetable oil electricity generator if I'm up near the Arctic circle in winter and have no sunlight etc. Not quite done,  but getting there,  the trick will be getting a business you can support yourself with from this kinda lifestyle- hence mobile software development. When all is done I'm going to call it 'Carbon Zero',  my personal vote (and latest crazy idea) on sustainable economic and environmental living... As I say,  not done yet,  but getting there slowly but surely. So far so good ;). 

Oh,  and I hear apple launched some server farms running on solar power... I'll be switching my streaming servers over to them in due course (after I've sorted this app business properly) so no one can say my businesses are unsustainable etc. So far it's just a proof of concept,  but when all is said and done I hope I'll have worked out some kinda environmentally and economically sustainable,  technologically up to date neo nomadic lifestyle. For places like Spain where there are massive population migrations away from certain urban centres etc due to lack of jobs etc,  this provides a way out. At the national level it would provide a highly flexible workforce which,  in economic times like these, is very much required. For the more creative people, the savings due to the decrease in cost of living mean they can a) save money for any artistic or entrepreneurial projects they may have or b) put more time aside to develop such projects as they need rather than pay rent on overpriced lodgings they can spend time in as they have to work to pay rent... So basically I hope you can see why I disagree with the eco village model as being tested out in Wales. It's a great idea and all,  but doesn't,  to my mind,  address all the underlying issues. You could still have such a place in the country side,  but the mobility I have provides certain advantages that they can't match... Also,  I should add,  my van is 25 years old so I'm not suggesting people do this with brand new vans (hence increasing the cost and carbon footprint etc) as that defeats the object.  Also modern diesel engines are a pain to maintain due to computer timings and suchlike and can't run natively on vegetable oil- they need it converted to biodiesel etc, another unnecessary step,   so it must run on repurposed old tech.  Specifically any of the old 'million mile motors' from Mercedes. Their engine tolerances are such they will,  with appropriate care and attention,  pretty much run for ever... I'm currently at 50,000 miles so far,  so have a bit of a way to go yet. 

But yeah,  basically at root,  this is a manifestation of the old Chinese advice in tough times to 'be like water,  my friend'.  I got bored of talking about it and thought I'd just do it.  Hence 'Carbon Zero'. 

Anyways,  enough rambling,  safe to say,  jusqu’ici tout va bien ;-).

The event is about presenting your idea and in return gaining invaluable insight, in a relaxed and friendly environment. 

At our first event back in June we brought together a wide range of different individuals from wildly different backgrounds. What ensued were some great conversations around the various ideas presented.

If you're interested in tech or products, then we're sure you'll enjoy this event.

If you're thinking of coming along let us know by registering over at [Eventbrite](https://letsdemo.eventbrite.com/).

I mentioned we missed Lennon because he has a lot of North London Derby's under his belt. He would of been preferable over Townsend on the day (on the right). 

The reason I placed Townsend in our strongest line up was because he has a great end product, much better than Lennon, and is left footed. Lamela I'm sure will take up the right spot where he played at Roma, and Chadli hasn't been cutting it on the left. Which means Townsend would naturally slot in on the left side and provide more of an assist role than the ""cut in on stronger foot and shoot"" role.

One question to the people in the yes camp, if the vote is solidly no (we can happily hash out what counts as a solid no if you want too), would you be willing to happily not act like the Québécois and try the neverendum silliness? I'm British/English, I do support the union, but I'm more than willing to let the Scottish people get independence if they want. I won't go into the arguments of yes and no and whatever. I'm just wanting to know how you will react after the vote. If its yes then of course there will be a lot of horse trading and dickering going on and life then moves on. But if its no, what happens next? Would you be happy to shelve the idea of independence for good or will you carry on regardless? I guess I gave my views away on this by calling the Québécois silly for constantly banging the independence drum after losing two referendums on the issue (admittedly the second time was only a narrow loss for them) but twice in fifteen years on such an issue seems excessive to me, they voted on the issue lost and did everything they could to do it again... To my mainly Anglophile Canadian friends and some of the Francophones the second time around was just bloody annoying to them. It also to me as an outsider seemed somewhat childish and wasteful in addition to creating more friction between the slightly schizophrenic country that is Canada.

Also would there be some legal and fair way to get the Scots to shut up about independence if they lose the referendum until after I'm dead from old age and living a long and sordid life of utter dissolution? :)",0,1378114787,null,0,false,0,cc04u09,t3_1liq7m,t1_cc04u09,t3_1liq7m,null,1429617832,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Prohobition makes very little difference to use numbers. Nobody gives a shit what the law says. If they want to get high they get high. If they want to use Heroin, they will. 

The only thing which changes is how you treat them after they've taken it and how they get it to begin with. For the better. You take the money off criminals and you stop throwing people suffering from medical ailments such as addiction in jail.

Primarily, I think what Fry said was stupid and uninformed. It was a massive simplification of the issue- and that's what you get when you talk about religion on twitter. What do you expect?

Oh, have a look around the world and see them slaughtering each other, let alone others. So charming to women too …"". That's just insulting. Look at many muslim countries and their histories, they're currently torn apart  by western powers trying to build empires and retreive oil. Meanwhile they beautiful histories of academia and free societies. It's clearly not islam that's the problem there, but you can't express nuance in 140 characters.



Secondly, I don't like Stephen Fry- there's something about his persona that I find off-putting.

Kolo is Kolo and was free. 

Cissokho, cheap and has shown great signs in the past. 

Sakho is a great young and proven defender. 

Ilori is young and though I haven't seen much of him, I have faith that our scouting team know what his potential is. 

Luis Alberto also falls similar to Ilori and he's done some fucking magical things for Barca B. 

Moses reminds me of Sturridge, quality player bought by Chelsea and never given a chance, hopefully he turns out to find the form Studge has and gets that #redordead mentality.

I believe all three of the main parties have promised there would be additional devolution in the event of a no vote. So presumably that would be the next step (it's hard to be more specific than that, since they are also refusing to provide any details of what that might be until after the vote).

However, it's worth remembering that prior to the 1979 devolution referendum the former Conservative Prime Minister (Alec Douglas-Home) also held out the offer of an alternative to devolution in the event of a no vote.

Those alternatives never appeared - it took a further 20 years before devolution occurred.

If there was a no vote then I would expect something similar to occur: jam tomorrow is an easy promise to make, but it is rarely followed through. If you're in your 60s then you probably won't live to see another referendum.

Moses will help us in the short term, he has got quality although he suits a counterattacking system with his power and pace. Good deal for us in the current situation though.

Really hope Sahko turns out to be a good signing for us, he has all the attributes to succeed.

Toure, as I said when we initially signed him, is a great addition to the squad in terms of experience and quality of work.

Mignolet has turned out to be the excellent replacement for Reina, as we all thought he would be.

Cissohko/Aspas add some depth to the squad. 

Ilori looks to be a longer term backup/replacement for Agger, due to similar playing styles. 

Overall I think, in the end, a very positive transfer window for us.

Much more depth to the squad and sime quality added in key positions.

My only fear is about BR comments of adding 20 goals to last years team, I think he wanted an attacking player with goals to help achieve this. Though Moses will help us until we can add one to the team.

If Sturridge stays injury free it will be a huge boost for us.

Tl; dr would have liked attacking mid. Moses is good short term cover though. Team has improved several key areas and added some depth to the squad.

Moreover; if Dembele was playing as a true CM, then he *should* have been playing at CAM, because that was where we needed him on the field; Capoue &amp; Paulinho already had control of the midfield.

At the end of the day, Dembele &amp; AVB share my blame for yesterday's game. Dembele for his abjectly horrible performance; if he was meant as the more advanced midfielder, he needed to play there; if not, he should have had some words with Paulinho and forced his way onto the ball more as it came out of the back.

Either way, as that game progressed, it was enormously obvious that we didn't need Moussa in a central role, that he was, in fact wasted there, and we needed an advanced midfielder to exploit the gap between their midfield and back line. This was where AVB failed yesterday; I believe he'll look back at the film of the game and realize that he waited too long &amp; never put in the correct player. Moussa should have been off at half, or if AVB was determined to let him try the CAM role, should have been off at 55' not 65', and either Holtby or Sigurdsson should have come on.

TL:DR; we will never know if Dembele was meant to be in a CAM role or not; if he was,  he was out of position basically all game; if he was playing as a CM he was lazy &amp; contributed basically nothing to our transitional &amp; attacking play.

The profit of drugs is overwhelmingly to do with the rarity of supply, and the incredible expense and risk involved in smuggling.

Certainly you can use 2l cider as an example, but you can also use higher priced, higher margin products, such as spirits, imported alcohol and cigarettes. Tobacco products have a similar weight/content margin as narcotics, and equally huge amounts of duty, yet the market for black market cigarettes is tiny.

Its ALWAYS cheaper to do business legitimately when it comes down to shipping products. It removes risk, it removes expenses, it gives you access to the open market,  which, by defintion, gives you better prices. 

Yes, I could stand on a street corner, avoid following regulation, hope my supplier can keep getting stuff in, hope my customers will find out who I am, when they have easier options to buy, and run the risk of arrest, and losing all my cash and stock. Its all incredibly risky, incosistent and expensive. Those are not conditions in which you can sell a cut price product.

Or I could open a bloody shop and have customers come to me. All in exchange for paying a small amount of tax.

Added to that, the majority of drug users are not desperate junkies, addicted and needing a fix at any cost. They are recreational users, who would be willing to pay more for a certain product of guranteed quality. Especially with powder based products- knowing what you are buying is worth a HUGE premium. 

Cut those people out and you have lost the majority of your market, and with it your ability to make most of your money.

Recreational use of cannabis does not interest or appeal to me, and I think being stoned makes being dim a lot more bearable for many people. Also, I detest the smell of it in the air, it's like the scent of musty lofts and body odor combined. I know some that would smoke weed all day, with all their money going toward getting their fix, their demeanour solely focused upon the points in the day when they can scratch that itch. 

Smoking and alcohol is detrimental to mental and physical health, so too is cannabis when not used in strict moderation. Whilst there are some benefits in using cannabis for certain medical purposes, there are further benefits in reducing the costs and negative effects associated with crime, which involve a considerable amount of policing and time. So it is more cost effective to declassify weed as an illegal substance. No plant should be illegal, and a lucrative commodity sells just as quickly as one which can be taxed and properly regulated.

Amsterdam for one.

Secondly Portugal decriminalised all drugs in 2000. This has resulted in;

* Increased uptake of treatment.
* Reduced cases of HIV by 17%.
* Reduced drug related deaths.
* Problematic adolescent (13-15) drug use declined.
* Drug related criminal justice work decreased.
* Reduced cost of drugs (therefore less need to burgle homes and mug people to fund the habit).

&gt;You don't get prosecuted if you get hospitalised for overdose anyway, and rehab is free. Where is this punishment for addicts that you're talking about?

You get arrested for possession. That gets you a criminal record which stains your whole life. It makes it harder to get a job which also feeds into the addiction. You're treated like a criminal not a medical case. It is a travesty.

[I'm not the only one who thinks this way.](http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/wp-content/themes/gcdp_v1/pdf/Global_Commission_Report_English.pdf)

A huge number of former and current world leaders and experts on the issue published that report in June 2011 stating how Drug Policy has failed in all regards.

&gt;So do you plan on leaving drugs totally untaxed and unregulated? otherwise, there's still a market for illegal drugs.

I don't recall saying anything to that effect. Drugs should be taxed and regulated, absolutely. I don't know where you got the idea from that I thought they shouldn't be.

They should be sold in shops and regulated just like alcohol is. I've never met or heard of a single person in the news or in person to ever have bought 'illegal' alcohol.

&gt;&gt;Ask most teenagers if its easier to get Cannabis or alcohol.

&gt;Alcohol, easily.

I'm afraid again the facts don't support that opinion. Hell even in reply to this very comment people are backing me up. [And studies have shown](http://blog.norml.org/2009/08/28/study-says-its-easier-for-teens-to-buy-marijuana-than-beer/) that its easier to get Cannabis than alcohol. Drug dealers don't ask for an ID.

And one final point.

The EU, in their own report on how 'horrible' drugs are, stated that less than 10% of drug users were 'problem' drug users. This means that they admitted, accidentally, that &gt;90% of drug users (any drug) are functioning users in which it doesn't impact their daily lives.

You think synthesizing and selling LSD would have the same level of regulation as fermenting and sellinghops? are you seriously telling me that you think that's how it would work?

&gt;The profit of drugs is overwhelmingly to do with the rarity of supply, and the incredible expense and risk involved in smuggling.

And the monetary cost of all those is close to 0. Legalising drugs would make smuggling much easier and drop the risk/expense. There would still be a demand, and the supply would still meet it.


&gt; Tobacco products have a similar weight/content margin as narcotics

*maybe* within an order of magnitude for cannabis. Otherwise no, that's ridiculous. shipping 24 tabs does not take up the same volume or weigh the same as 24 cigarettes worth of tobacco. 

&gt;Its ALWAYS cheaper to do business legitimately when it comes down to shipping products. It removes risk, it removes expenses, it gives you access to the open market, which, by defintion, gives you better prices. 

If that were the case there would be no black market in goods that can be bought legally, which isn't true.

&gt;Or I could open a bloody shop and have customers come to me. All in exchange for paying a small amount of tax.

The government is not going to throw up its arms and say ""well, let's let 15 year olds/convicted criminals/civil servants/mentally ill people have unfettered access to opiates"". Which means there will still be a market for those people, which means there will still be the opportunity to charge enough to make a profit. You don't seem to understand that legalisation does not make the market disappear, not at all, it just eats into it.

Both Portugal and Czech Republic have had lots of success with Decriminalising drug use. If anything its given addicts better access to judgement free help, overall consumption of certain more dangerous drugs have fallen, non violent people no longer being criminalised due to personal possession. 

&gt; Where is this punishment for addicts that you're talking about?

He didn't mention punishment. How is punishing vulnerable sick people actually helping anyone, and not just cementing their addiction further? The logic of beating something into someone never works.

&gt; So do you plan on leaving drugs totally untaxed and unregulated? otherwise, there's still a market for illegal drugs. 

He never said that either. Legalising something, and that thing being taxed and regulated is the same thing surely? You'll never get rid of some of the illegal trade, that exists for literally everything (alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, clothes.)

&gt; Ask most teenagers if its easier to get Cannabis or alcohol.

They are both in theory with about as easy as each other, however they both have pitfalls. For example I can walk from my house and buy alcohol very easily from a number of locations, there is always plenty of choice and I know what I'm getting. However if I get I.D'd (challenge 25 etc)then I can have my access to that stopped whereas I've never been asked for ID from a weed dealer.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;Legalising drugs would make smuggling much easier and drop the risk/expense. 

Why? Why on earth would the penalties for smuggling be in any way reduced? If anything there would be justification for making them tougher due to there being legitimate channels. If we look at how things are going down in the US, that is, in fact, what has happened, with medical marijuana dealers who do not follow regulations suffering penalties orders of magnitude greater than other types of black marketeer.

&gt;And the monetary cost of all those is close to 0. 

What? The cost of lost wages due to time spent in prison? The cost of legal fees? The cost to pay mules who are taking HUGE risks, versus the cost to pay a shipping? The cost to replace products when they are confiscated? The loss of business when your supply chain collapses as is frequently the case?

The expense/profit of drugs is ENTIRELY a function of the risk involved in it being an illegal business. All of these costs are built into the street price.

The cost to produce MDMA, is TINY in comparison to the cost to produce cigarettes.

These products are not inherently valuable. In fact they are dirt cheap. The expense comes from the illegality, and solely from the illegality. 


&gt;The guy standing behind it will sell you 3ml of fuck-knows-what right now, no questions asked, no ID required.

And how on EARTH did he afford to buy that charging those prices? He had to buy several stages down a chain of criminals, including mules all of whom are risking jail, and loss of product.

He is still paying virtually ALL of the costs of running an illegal business, which are eye watering. Yet he cannot charge the price for an illegal product.

What on earth are this guys margins when he is trying to undercut the legitimate seller with a supply chain which is orders of magnitude cheaper and more reliable?

And even assuming that he can somehow pull off this magical feat, then YES, he will get next to no business in comparison to the volume of trade done by the legitimate business (the downsides for which you mention are, frankly, surreal). He will be an insignificant component of the market, dependent entirely on word of mouth, from desperate people with no money.

&gt; You don't seem to understand that legalisation does not make the market disappear, not at all, it just eats into it.

Quite, just like the market for other black market goods. Its small, and more or less insignificant. 

The market isn't there, the profits aren't there, yet the risk remains. And in comparison to other black market substances, the risks for drug sellers not following regulations would unquestionably be higher than for other bootlegs, as we have seen in the US.

[Portugal decriminalized drug use for personal use in 2001](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html), seems like a success:

&gt;The Cato paper reports that between 2001 and 2006 in Portugal, rates of lifetime use of any illegal drug among seventh through ninth graders fell from 14.1% to 10.6%; drug use in older teens also declined. Lifetime heroin use among 16-to-18-year-olds fell from 2.5% to 1.8% (although there was a slight increase in marijuana use in that age group). 

&gt;New HIV infections in drug users fell by 17% between 1999 and 2003, and deaths related to heroin and similar drugs were cut by more than half. In addition, the number of people on methadone and buprenorphine treatment for drug addiction rose to 14,877 from 6,040, after decriminalization, and money saved on enforcement allowed for increased funding of drug-free treatment as well.

&gt;The Cato report's author, Greenwald, hews to the first point: that the data shows that decriminalization does not result in increased drug use. Since that is what concerns the public and policymakers most about decriminalization, he says, ""that is the central concession that will transform the debate.""",0,1378122521,null,0,false,0,cc05tc5,t3_1lkeut,t1_cc05tc5,t1_cc055q6,null,1429617375,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

From the *highest level in the EU*. You don't think they might have been taking other preventative measures too? 

&gt;rest of it

Do you have any statistics on the rest of the EU to compare that to? the UK also had a reduction in illicit drug use during that period, do you know if it was greater or smaller than Portugal's?

&gt;You get arrested for possession.

You don't get arrested for possession if you don't possess anything, and once you've taken a drug, it legally ceases to exist. Walking through an airport with a blunt is not legal, walking through an airport 30 seconds after smoking one is fine. Going to a hospital because you OD'd does not get you a criminal record, that's not up for debate.

We *already* have clinics that help you with addiction. We *already* provide rehab without pressing *any* criminal charges. We *already* have all the information the government could possibly give out available online. What do you think legalisation is going to do, other than legalise carrying drugs in public? 

&gt;I've never met or heard of a single person in the news or in person to ever have bought 'illegal' alcohol.

How many shipping containers do you need to carry £1,000,000 of uncut cocaine? what about £1,000,000 of knockoff vodka?

&gt;And studies have shown

Those are studies from the US, you do realise that in america you can't legally drink until you're 21 right? Obviously, there's going to be a greater effort dedicated to preventing underage drinking when the proportion of people likely to do it is pretty much doubled.

&gt;Who the hell are you or anybody else to tell people that something they do in their spare time with their body is any of your business when &gt;90% do so without harm to their lives? As purely a moral issue that point alone should win the argument.

what?

It's relative to harm done by that &lt;10%, obviously. If &lt;10% of MPs are corrupt, that's still bad. If &lt;10% of cars explode instantly killing their occupants in their operational lifetimes, that's not ok because 90% of them don't. If something has negative effects (like drug use) and can be prevented (like drug use) it makes sense to prevent it.

It isn't. Pharmaceutical Q and A is both rigorous and extremely cheap. The only component that raises costs for drugs is the cost of drug design. After that you are manufacturing hundreds -thousands of tabs for pennies.

I said the same AMOUNT of regulation. Quite specifically. I did not say the same type. It clearly won't be. But it would be not especially more burdensome than those involved in distributing alcohol.

As for harder drugs I doubt it would make much of a dent at all for three reasons (and personally I don't even favour the legalisation of all drugs, meaning IMO heroin and the like should stay banned). Firstly many people are still very wary of harder drugs because they are aware of their addictive properties, as well as the perception that it is extremely dangerous. And secondly the price, when even the NHS pays ~£80/g, granted you take smaller doses, it is far from as affordable or a likely purchase for a novice.

It wouldn't benefit them in any way.

As for the players, Sahin chose to go to Liverpool and not us, Real were willing to sell Coentrao to us but Coentrao reportedly asked for £85k - £120k a week in wages and (thus far) Levy/Baldini said no.  Real can't force the players to come to us anymore than we can force our players to go somewhere (Ade to Bestikas for example).

Pretty sure the ""special relationship"" was just for marketing and potentially coaching and nothing else.

Selective breeding looks to stabilize traits which already exist. Which means to say that the weed isn't stronger. If we have 30% THC cannabis strains today then we had 30% THC cannabis strains before. It just means that say out of 100 seeds, a higher proportion of those seeds will grow to be higher strength varieties. This is because breeding works with genetics which are already available in the wild.

You might say aha! So you admit that cannabis is getting stronger.... well no, the seeds and strains being developed may be getting ""better"" but any grower worth his salt isn't using seeds. They are using clones.

Clones have been used almost since the dawn of horticulture itself. Growers in the 60s and 70s were using clones. And there are many famous examples of special plants being found which have then been kept for decades as clones. Eg. Psychosis Cheese. Haze...

So it's a total myth that advanced breeding techniques have created new super strength strains.

Quality control is not cheap compared to not controlling quality. Drug companies spend millions of pounds automating it because that's the cheapest way to do things.]

&gt;Why? Why on earth would the penalties for smuggling be in any way reduced?

Are HM customs going to keep investing in as many sniffer dogs and scanners as they use now? Are they going to be able to prove that goods haven't been bought legitimately? are the police going to be allowed the same level of funding on anti-drug units they have now?

&gt;What? The cost of lost wages due to time spent in prison?

I know right, and I bet the cartels waste *loads* of money paying into pension funds for dealers too. I wonder whether they pay wages via direct debit or just small heaps of cocaine.

true,gomez12,null,null,"I actually disagree. I think we have grown up during something of a 'golden age' of the Internet when it was a free for all. I know the RIAA/MPAA/etc are horrible out of date and backwards, but it is getting progressively harder and harder to download things illegally now. I think that overall they are winning the war on piracy. I've been downloading TV shows, music, games and software for ages and it is getting progressively harder to do.

Back in the day, you could just search yahoo or ask jeeves and find a site with the mp3 files for direct download. It wasn't fast, but it was straightforward.

Then it was napster, kazaa and limewire but Napster were sued and the others just kinda died, as well as full of fakes, viruses and anti-piracy people. Even back then you could get warning letters. 

Then it was mIRC and downloads from there, but that was geeks only and not applicable to the majority of the public.

Then it was public torrents, which are still around but they are dying too as far as I can tell. They are insecure, people get warning letters very easily, piratebay, katz and others are blocked in the UK. Even in Sweden didn't a couple of the founding members eventually get convicted and sent to jail? That's a big deterrent against hosting similar sites. Sure you can VPN or proxy around them, but the circle is closing tighter and it is getting harder. And even private trackers aren't immune - oink was closed down suddenly by the authorities, and most people don't have access and can't seed enough to make private trackers feasible.

Direct downloads were great for a while. If you had premium access to a download server (rapidshare, megaupload etc) you could browse forums and get links easily. But megaupload was killed and all the others had to change their policies, essentially killing this idea. Plus you have to pay a subscription or be incredibly patient if you are going to download anything reasonably sized (over 200-400Mb usually) due to waiting times, download limits, one file per session etc. That's a lot of hassle, not to mention when you have downloaded most parts of the file and then the links all get taken down. Downloading a 4Gb HD movie with those file hoster sites and no premium access will take hours, even if you automate it with JDownloader. Dropbox was even used for a while, but your account gets banned pretty quick if they detect abuse. Mega hasn't really caught on either, at least not that I can tell.

Newgroups are still going but are too complicated for most people, and you also have to pay. My newsgroup subscription costs $11/month, (compared to netflix costing £6.99 it's about the same) and you'll probably want access to some sort of premium indexer. The best indexer, nzbmatrix, was closed too, showing that even newsgroups aren't immune from prosecution.

So really all of them have problems, have been restricted, shut down or made very difficult. You can't really pirate effectively for free any more. If you have 20 TV shows that you want to keep up with, you either take the risk with public torrents, or be incredibly patient with the file hoster sites

A spotify or netflix subscription now starts to make the most sense, as well as buying games during Steam sales. Pirating is becoming too hard, and when it starts to actually cost you the same amount as streaming or buying the same thing, what is the point any more?

I've never used it myself, but i have recently embarked on some of the most powerful psychedelics known to man. First venture into the world of drugs. I used to be very narrow minded when it came to drug users, viewing them as weak and dimwitted. Needless to say, i no longer hold that view (and that was a long time ago).

But i agree, no plant should be illegal. People should be free to put whatever they like in their bodies. People of a certain age anyway. Instead we're peddled things like tobacco (which isn't even just tobacco) and alcohol, which undoubtedly cause way more health issues.

I think the real reason drugs are forbidden is simple. They open minds. Governments would have a hell of a time controlling the population if everybody dropped lsd. Just look back to the 60's. People need to feel pressured in everyday life to keep the machine turning. And legalizing most drugs would stop that machine, and people would be thinking ""what the fuck are we doing spending half of our lives in a meaningless job for some man-made concept known as money?"".

You should become a policeman in Bali or Thailand or somewhere. The mules you caught would LOVE you believing their sad stories of why they had no choice but to accept vast sums of money in payment for taking flights.

&gt;So if I disagree but don't know why I just say it's frankly surreal and move on?

I have told you repeatedly, and at considerable length why. He has a tiny market to work with, of desperate people, looking for a cheaper product, and is utterly dependent on word of mouth marketing, in a business where word of mouth is no longer the rule, while he sells a lower quality, generic product.

It is a pretty basic consequence he will get next to no business. Trying to run a business in the worst conditions possible with only a tiny fraction of the market generally does mean you get next to no business.
 
The comments I said were surreal were the idea that customers would be put on some kind of NHS register.  I have no idea were you got that idea from. It is totally at odds with NHS harm reduction policy.

&gt;because I have a basic level of understanding of pharmaceutical quality control compared to alcohol quality control, and I can make cider in my garage to sell perfectly legally but if I did the same for paracetamol I would be arrested, imprisoned, and banned from ever working in a pharmacy.

Sure, but the regulation also involves the disparate other requirements of paying duty, the limitations of what kind of volumes you can sell, who you can sell too, the manufacturing conditions, the employment conditions. Craft breweries have to have pretty rigorous QA processes to operate as commerical business, but the only truly burdensome part is the duty. As I said, its a comparable amount, but not necessarily the same type.

Even if it is more, it is in no fashion especially budernsome.

Also, as you indicate, you can manufacture paracetomol in your garage. Or Certrizine. Or ibuoprofen

Why aren't people?

&gt;I know right, and I bet the cartels waste loads of money paying into pension funds for dealers too. I wonder whether they pay wages via direct debit or just small heaps of cocaine.

The Cartels will pay what they need in order to get the dealers to deal. The dealers will work for an amount they consider worth it. The risk of going down is the major component in whether to do it or not. They aren't going to deal or carry for the equivalent of minimum wage. Kids are getting drawn into the business on the promise of easy money, not hours of hard work in order to make a low wage, with the risk of getting sent down.

Mid level dealers make HUGE amounts of money, and generally posses skill sets that could see them earning money elsewhere. You might be able to pay some street dealers in gear, but thats pretty much it. 

To a dealer deciding whether or not to deal he needs compensated for the risk he is taking. Otherwise he isn't going to do it. Thats where the money they make comes from. 

If you're making way less using your van to transport drugs than you would to do home removals, your not going to do it.

&gt;Are HM customs going to keep investing in as many sniffer dogs and scanners as they use now

You know thats mostly terrorism funding, yes? We're not getting rid of those no matter what happens to drugs.

Activities which fund criminal gangs get HUGE amounts of funding, including the policing of the small black market be have in the UK.

What we would cease to spend money on was the policing of low level possession.

I can. I'm aiming at dropping weight, about 15-20 kilo's just because I'm bored of being a big guy. However, I'm naturally quite strong and I'm trying to find some way of dropping said fat-weight whilst retaining the strength-weight.

Not sure if a decent amount of cardio (Say 1 hour a day) + some decent weights regieme would be good. Because then you get the diet side of this... and I end up very confused.",0,1378124830,null,0,false,0,cc06623,t3_1lkmyu,t1_cc06623,t1_cc064lm,null,1429617210,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","I think you're over-simplifying at this stage. The disparity of costs between a second home in (Hull / London / wherever) are going to be great and the truth is there are people out there who take work at distances further than they'd like in order to give themselves the best shot possible. Just because you *have* to hold down a second home doesn't make it something you ""easily have the money for"" - that's way too simple. 

Food for thought, my family comes from the south coast but my dad had a role outside London towards Slough. The cost of petrol (plus length of commute) made a daily trip impossible. The cost of housing made renting pretty unviable as well. His solution in the end? He bought a boat, and kept it moored on the Thames - and made a weekly commute to it. The cost of mooring fees plus small electrical charge etc. was much cheaper than renting or owning property nearer Slough. 

Long story short - he had to be there for the work, but the work didn't pay enough to own a second property there. If he had to buy a boat to get around the problem, think how it might affect others who don't have much breathing space between ""I can do this if I have a second property"" and ""This costs too much for me to hold the job down on my current salary"".
