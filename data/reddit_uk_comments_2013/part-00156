Traditionally, stories were short multi-part (usually 4) serialized episodes with all but the last ending in a mild cliff-hanger.

The stories (despite being multiple parts) were independent for most series. (The three exceptions being the Dalek's Master Plan, the Key to Time, and Trial of a Time Lord) But these still relied on the individual mini-cliff hangers each week to construct the stories which constructed the overarching story for the whole series.

The reboot mostly did a way with mid-story cliff hangers (except for a few two-parters here and there) and made it standard that each season / series would be constructed as an overarching story.

I'm in no way defending their right to say such things but believe that the problem could be mitigated by simply allowing twitter and if necessary the police to do their jobs without creating such a huge outcry.

Someone once said (and I so should know who as I'm a Women's and Gender Studies student, but I hope you'll forgive me its summer and I've been letting my brain rot and get full of fluff) that there are as many different types of feminisms as there are people in this world who adhere to it.

But there are a few types you should know of. Radical feminists are the type that get labeled the crazies. They generally don't hold to well with the men folk, may believe in only lesbian only relationships or at the very least non penetrative sex, and see the patriarchy in everything.

Strident feminists tend to be a bit more middle of the road but still politically active. (Its where I tend to see myself) The Gloria Stienams, the Hilary Clintons. Some may not shave their legs, some may. :-) Most see patriarchy in a lot of things (like the number of women on Doctor Who's writing staff) and get frustrated about it, but its not about men's hatred of women, as it is with Radical feminists, it is more of a system of inequalities that has existed for hundreds of years.

Moderate feminists tend to agree with Strident feminists but are less politically active. 

But above all not all feminists agree on every issue. And there are subgroups like LGBT feminists, or Women of color, or Christian Feminists, Jewish Feminists, ect. There is tons of overlap and no over lap and its why its hard for us to get a lot done. Hope that helps.

Not much Doctor in that one, though... I'd suggest the episode that got *you* hooked on Doctor Who (or the prospect of Tennant as The Doctor). 

For me, that would be 'The Girl In The Fireplace'. It's got fun moments, sad moments, a jump scare (well... I jumped when the android under the bed moved), creepy moments (human parts used on the ship), more glimpses into the darkness that dwells within The Doctor (when Madame de Pompadour gets a look into The Doctor's mind). 

That's what made me a fan of David Tennant as The Doctor. I liked him in the episodes prior, but this episode made me fall in love.

true,KiloAlphaM,lfc68,,"Wow well done, I enjoyed reading all of that and you have placed some entertaining gifs in there.

I really think our next signing will be huge, a goal getter from either a midfielder or winger/forward. I really believe he will be a first team player. We have added enough depth on most fronts but we still to add another 10 goals to the team.

I remember at the end of the season when we finished with 71 Goals for (GF), Brendan mentioned we needed to another about another 20 goals to the team. I think between Aspas, Alberto, and Ibe we have added maybe another 10-15 goals, maybe a bit more depending on how they settle in and how much time they get. So we still need another 5-10 goals to come from somewhere.

And with Brendan seemingly happy with Skrtel and Wisdom being our backup Center Backs, all this fuss about Papa and Alder might just be smokescreen. Spurs will most likely losing Bale, so we might be hurrying to capture someone who might interest them before they get a huge splash of money from his sale, if it happens.

I have heard a lot of good things about Bernard, and mixed reviews of Ericksen. They might both be good targets, but I'm hoping we can grab a young striker in the mold of Suarez/Aspas with that same energy and drive with a little creativity sprinkled in there so Brendan can mold and turn to when we are up a few goals. As I don't think Borini is going to cut it in the middle with his displays in the pre-season, it just might be confidence, but we can't keep depending on him to one day gain his confidence and start playing amazingly.

Wow this is long, but one more thing that occurred to me, Ibe seems like a striker in the mold of Sturridge. So we might already have that young backup striker role filled with how well he has played so far. 

Well thats enough speculation for me.

**TD/DR:**

* Read the damn thing, its not that long but
* Center back rumors might just be a smokescreen for another player who can deliver 5-10 goals or more.
* We still need a young striker to mold and grow with the team as Borini might not cut it for us. Someone who plays like Suarez/Aspas.

Translation.  Capitalism overrode all other considerations, and Nazi Germany was, at least, capitalist.  Deeper history.

Not afraid to admit that as a grown man I did feel quite emotional following that documentary. How anybody who isn't in the situation can sit on their high horse and claim that assisted suicide is a terrible idea, is hardly in a position to relate to it.

That said, I can understand their concerns, and the legal framework around this would have to be very carefully written. Ultimately a judge would have to make the decision on a case-by-case basis; also, doctors who don't wish to assist people with suicide shouldn't be forced to break their oath.

I can't see why having a tightly controlled version of Dignitas, for the terminally ill, would be such a terrible thing for the UK. I've seen several members of my own family go through some terrible illnesses, all terminal; seeing them gradually degrade to a point that they don't have control over their own bodies is a tragedy.

There's also a Hoo Hing in Brum, but I've not been into it, so can't say whether they carry any Japanese lines.

Miso soup should theoretically be dirt cheap to make. All you need is some instant dashi, mirin, and miso paste. The rest is commonly available (veggies of your choice, silken tofu, egg, whatever you want to put in there).

If you're finding mirin expensive (because let's face it, it *is*) you can use honteri instead, which is identical in flavour, just not brewed from sake, so much cheaper.

My oldest son is never home and when he is, he's locked in his room listening to angry music. My youngest son, he's only 4, I look at him and he asks me to play... and I feel nothing. No love, no tenderness... just a void. And when I look in the mirror...I don't recognize the face staring back at me. It's aged so much from the boyish looks I remember. The years have carved deep lines of despair, worry and anguish. Dark, hollow eyes where once gleamed hope and excitement. Thin lips unable to find the smile of the happy, old days.

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"Unfortunately I don't think we do flats very well in this country. Publicly owned high rises have pretty much turned into slums, putting many people off. Private sector flats are absolutely tiny and in my experience tend to have poor sound insulation. And putting in some laminate flooring while squeezing the kitchen into a corner of the living room somehow qualifies the place as ""executive"" or ""luxury"". There are no advantages to living in a flat, but you have the disadvantage of having to share your space with strangers and (because flats are almost always sold as leaseholds) you still have to pay rent.

Basically, we're *building* these things to be second class to 'proper' houses.

I'm not a city dweller, but I'd probably be happy to live in a flat as long as a few conditions are met:

* It has to be spacious enough for my needs - this means space for my hobbies *and* storage for appliances, cleaning materials, etc. Given the cost of land I'm very surprised that developers haven't made good use of vertical space.

* It must have sufficient privacy: soundproofing and not too overlooked by other flats.

* It must have the amenities locally that I require, particularly green space. No driveway so somewhere to work on the car, bike or whatever (even shared) would be great. Near to shops, public transport and public services like sports centres/gyms.

* I want the freehold, I'd like to actually own where I live, have a say in how the place is run/managed and not have to pay ground rent.

I've heard that in some countries (Canada is one example) flats come with facilities like gyms/pools for the residents, and are often built on top of shopping complexes and/or rail stations. People don't need to drive to use these facilities, and the extreme locality to public transport encourages its use. Unfortunately good ideas like this will not catch on while we have a stagnant, uninnovative building sector.

Trust me, raising the funds for Bale will not have been 'easy' for them, the sale of Higuain almost certainly necessary before they could go for it. Don't be fooled by the galacticos era spending, that was largely from money raised at the time from selling off various land around Madrid that the club owned.

In other words, your account password. Why on earth do they need this? When I queried it with Virgin Media, they've said that you can just put a full stop instead - so clearly it's not really that necessary. 
There's more than enough information on the form to identify yourself - I can't see why they need more than an account number/email address/phone number to contact you.

I'm not particularly knowledgeable about such things, but that form looks suspiciously like it'll be sent in plain text to VM. After all, are they able to split off and encrypt the section that asks for your password, or will it just be sent to a customer rep in one go? My money is that it's all sent as a plain text form.

And let's face it - a lot of people's account password will be the same as their email password. Yes, that's their fault, but zipping these passwords around in plain text leaves them even more vulnerable.

Overtaking on the motorway is easy, just make sure your left mirror is set up well. If you have a blind spot, do a quick check over your left shoulder. 

Left turns also easy, more so if your boyfriend doesn't lean forward to try and help.

When it comes to roundabouts, just remember stuff comes from the left :) I had my girlfriend remind me the first few times just in case.

You do need to carry stuff in your car in France by law. Safety triangle and hi vis vest. I'd get a set of spare bulbs for lights just in case too. I'm not sure it's law yet, but I heard something about having a disposable breathalyser in there too... I've never carried one though.

Make sure your lights are adjusted to the other side. Some cars are easy to switch, some require sticky things to be applied.  Halfords sell them. Erm, GB sticker on car if it's not on your plates.

I say again though, it's easy. You'll be fine! One big thing while I remember. Unless it's marked otherwise, traffic from the right has priority. I believe the signs are little white diamonds... but if you're on a country road and there are no signs or give way markings,  give way to stuff from the right, no matter the comparative size of road!

The first of his two main points I think is actually wrong - harrassment isn't *necessarily* covered by ""You may not publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others"". For example ""I'm coming to your house and I'm going to rape you"" would clearly fall under the pre-existing clause, whereas ""you deserve to get raped"" may arguably not, as it's not a threat to actually *perform* a particular act of violence, just a contention that it would somehow be deserved if it happened (I feel uncomfortable even typing that). I would still consider it a threat of violence personally, but given the distinction I could see the argument.

I cook every other day along with my GF, usually in bulk so that I can freeze the stuff and have it next week.

I have hundreds of recipes saved in Evernote that I pick up from odd places around the net and in books.

punet of plum toms (cut a cross in the bottom stick hot water from the kettle over them and peel) 
Basil
Spagetti
Bacon (optional)
Olive Oil
Onions
Garlic

Stick all in the pan, fry for a bit with plenty of olive oil. make your pasta, combine, add a little more oil. Serve with Parmasan and Basil.

True fans watch every minute, and if you want to be a Liverpool fan, you have to be one of the best.' He's not even a Red himself. I even remember my sister telling me to just watch, just in case.

“Yes, people may say that we missed out on Champions League football last season. But you look at the way the club has responded and straightaway you are excited about the way the team is being restructured to go again.

“Out of those three players, only Chadli has ­actually joined the squad so far, but I’ve already told him the team spirit is ­incredible and that he will love it here.

“You need that bond to work as a unit on the pitch and I think we’ve got that. We’re a group that has grown up together. Me, Gareth, 
Aaron Lennon, Tom ­Huddlestone, Michael Dawson, just to mention a few of the names.

“I can’t talk about Gareth’s ­situation, because I don’t know anything about it - and it would be unfair for me to focus on anything other than my own job.

“But I can see why Spurs fans would be excited about Soldado coming because I am excited myself about the prospect of playing with him.

“He is a fantastic striker – sharp around the box and hungry to score goals.

“For me, it’s not a case of thinking, ‘A top-class forward is coming in, maybe I’m not going to play.’ At the end of the day, I work hard and look after myself, so that I can give myself the best chance of bringing goals to the team.”

“A guy like Soldado can only strengthen us. Maybe if we’d had him last season as well as Emmanuel Adebayor we would already be in the Champions League. He’s a ­goalscorer.

“Nacer also looks a very good player. From what I’ve seen of him, he has got fantastic upper body strength and great feet.

“He’s a Tottenham-type of player. Clever, gets on the ball, plays one-twos, looking for the killer pass.

“Paulinho is a top signing. He’s a midfielder who finishes like a forward and the lads can’t wait to welcome him. He’s had his break after the Confederations Cup so we get to see him on Wednesday morning for the first time.

“We’re just like the fans. When we get new signings we can’t wait to see them in training.

“When we are finally all together and we’re looking around the dressing room, I know I’ll be excited about what we can achieve this season.

“If we just get off to a good start, you never know. Its about having the experience not to make the mistakes that cost us last time around.

Dear Museums Supporter,

Just a quick update!

Thank-you for signing the petition calling on Canterbury City Council to end plans for seasonal closure at three local museums.

Last Thursday, the City Council Executive voted to introduce plans for seasonal closure from January 1st next year. This despite pleas to first talk to volunteer groups and seek alternative solutions for running our museums, rather than simply cutting the amount of time they are open.

This makes the petition more important than ever.

We need to collect as many signatures as possible to show the Executive just how vital it is to keep our museums open all year round for local residents and visitors.

That's where you come in!

If we can each find another five people who can spare two minutes to sign the petition online, that would mean another 1,000 signatures straight away. And potentially 5,000 more if THEY pass on details of the petition to 5 people too!

The online petition can be found at http://tinyurl.com/savelocalmuseums.

Thank you again for your support. We will continue to campaign for our museums to stay open all year round. Our district was built on its proud history and heritage, and we need to keep it that way.

Best wishes,

James Flanagan 
Councillor for Westgate Ward, Canterbury 
Email: james.flanagan@canterbury.gov.uk

P.S. There is now a new group on Facebook called 'Keep our museums open!', set up to spread awareness of the plans for seasonal closure. Please join the group if you are on Facebook, and please let others know it is there too.

All depends what you wanna do really.

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"I'm no Sir but I've been reading /r/economics to try to get my head around this for a while I'll give it a shot:

The entire drive towards austerity is predicated on the idea that when a Government's debt (not deficit) hits 90% of GDP, the country goes into a ""viscious circle"" style descent into uncontrollable, spiraling debt, inflation and unemployment. This idea is fairly prevalent in reporting (you may have loosely heard the idea yourself) and certainly prevalent on the BBC coupled with titles like ""Highest ever annual deficit"" that give the impression that the UK's spending is running out of control.

All of this ignores a bunch of key points:

1) Practically speaking, deficit tends to have a lot more to do with the sate of the economy than it does with levels of government spending. When an economy goes into recession tax receipts fall and government spending on welfare has to increase but the Keynesian idea of investing in structural funds is massively well evidenced and has pretty much always been the done thing.

2) Inflation and growth mean that as a % of GDP our net debt can and does effectively shrink even in times of deficit spending. No one mentions this, ever. 

3) The BBC and others are guilty of using some very dodgy stats. A simple example is factoring in the privatisation of Norther Rock under Labour as an expenditure then lauding the sale of Norther Rock under the Tories as part of their debt reduction efforts when really almost all decent economists think that the bank  privatisation should be ignored in these stats because it makes them misleading.

4) The highest ever annual deficit thing that is peddled by the BBC and many other outlets is a complete red-herring. The total number of pounds of debt we have grows all the time because of inflation anyway. Typically we've had record deficit spending or record debt at least 1 year in 4 since 1960. In much the same way, pretty much very year I've worked my salary has hit a ""record high"" due to a 2% cost of living adjustment. Yet somehow I don't feel richer...

The BBC narrative constantly talks about how change HAS to happen due to spiraling debt. It is presumed in all their articles that cost austerity measures urgently have to be made to avoid the catastrophe of debt reaching 100% of GDP and it appears in articles on student loans and the NHS even though the NHS restructuring costs money and it already provides excellent value for money when you look at it against it's outcomes:

Costs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita
Life expectancy:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy

And the new student loans system actually costs both the student and the UK more than the old system.

But the problem is the basis, the whole debt at 90% of GDP = economic collapse thing is just a hypothesis and it's actually been massively slated:

http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/04/the-rogoff-and-reinhart-controversy-a-summing-up.html

The whole idea that austerity is a necessity is actually very poorly supported and this is the main argument that the BBC never, ever covers.

I hope they thought it was necessary and didn't do it just because they could... Though why would you need 5 officers there...?

For anyone who is interested:

&gt; A strip search is a search involving the removal of more than outer clothing. **A strip search may only take place if the custody officer considers it necessary to remove an article that you would not be allowed to keep**. They should not be authorised routinely. The courts have recognised that strip searches may be deeply humiliating and that the removal of a brassiere, for instance, would require considerable justification. **No person of the opposite sex except for an appropriate adult who has been specifically requested by the person being searched may be present at such a search, nor anyone whose presence is unnecessary**. Except in cases of urgency **there must be two people present** other than the person being searched, when the search involves exposure of intimate parts of the body. One of these may be the appropriate adult, if relevant. Reasons for a strip search and the results of the search must be recorded on the custody record.

Fine, your biggest issue will be placing your car on the road, on narrow roads or streets be careful and take your time. Toll booths will not be too much of an issue because you have a passenger.

&gt;How long did it take for you to adjust?

No time at all. when you leave the ferry or chunnel you're straight onto motor way, this is great because you can't really go wrong on the motorway and it gives you some easy driving to get used to things before you get to the fun roads.

&gt;Apart from the obvious (different road signs, different speed limits etc) is there anything I need to be aware of?

Speed limit changes if its raining. You MUST maintain good lane discipline on motorways.

&gt;My boyfriend won't be driving but I know he will have to help me when I overtake or make left turns - is there anything he can do now to prepare?

Junctions not so much but a pair of eyes in the passenger seat is very useful at french roundabouts.

As for all the equipment that everyone's suggesting you carry I wouldn't get too upset if you don't have it all. The breathalyser is not a legal requirement yet.

Roberto Soldado, who yesterday said he did not know what was going to happen, will leave to London to play for Tottenham, after the English has transferred Except Amadeo requests and pay the 30 million euros in two installments-one of them this week, as he had demanded the Mestalla. 

&gt; And, if last week was Amadeo Except who yielded to agents Toldrá Roberto Soldado-consulting-to agree to negotiate with the Spurs, now are the agents who have made Franco Baldini strength to accept the conditions of the Valencia team and fruitful operation. Something will happen tomorrow when the team manager of the England team officially notified that Tottenham Valenica accepts CF requirements and send relevant documentation to the financial director of Valencia CF, Immaculate Ibanez. 

&gt; Therefore, if there are no surprises, this Wednesday will close the transfer of Roberto Soldado to Tottenham for 30 million euros distributed in two installments, the first of them this week. Rather than allow the team to find replacement for Valencia Valencia striker, who will not travel to the United States and may leave Valencia as new player of Tottenham.

**And...here is how I piece this together**

&gt; It's the end of the saga. Roberto Soldado will be, in the next few hours, finally a Tottenham player. Soldado will not travel to the U.S. on Thursday to play the second phase of the Guiness Champions Cup. This completes one of Valencias most notorious transfers, as they are set to receive 30 million euros. Soldado, who said yesterday he did not know what was going to happen, will now leave for London after the English clubs offer was excepted; in which 30 million euros will be paid in two installments - one of them this week.

&gt; (I can barely make sense of this first part, lets skip this). An announcement is expected tomorrow, when the club/AVB officially announce that Tottenham have agreed the transfer of Soldado from Valencia, pending medical. 

&gt;Therefore, providing there are no surprises, this Wednesday will close the transfer of Roberto Soldado to Tottenham for 30 million euros distributed in two installments. Rather than allow Valencia to wait and find a replacement for Soldado (who will not travel to the U.S.).

1. Make sure you've got some coins with you if you get on an Autoroute (motorway) as they're often toll roads.

2. If you go somewhere where you're off major roads, be careful when approaching junctions as other cars may just pop out in front of you. It's rare these days, but sometimes the car to the right of you has right-of-way.


In the UK, every single road is designated a major or a minor at a junction - in other words, one is the 'road' and the other is the 'junction'. This is commonplace everywhere, but in rural France they've not done this, and instead, whichever car on the right has right-of-way. It's called ['priority to the right'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_to_the_right) (or priorité a droite, in France's case).

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Do you believe Dombaxe holds a place in our strongest U-21 side with loanees recalled?

Probably not. If you were trying to stack the U-21 side Carroll has to be first name on the team sheet. Pritchard/Townsend would lock down the wing spots meaning Ceballos would probably end up as the other CM. Luongo would be first choice DM, Veljkovic possibly next. Mason also in the mix (for CM/CAM).

&gt;Do you believe Dombaxe holds a place in our strongest U-21 side, granted current loans?

Yeah. Carroll is essentially a first team squad member in my eyes and with Pritchard on loan there is the argument that Ceballos would be nice on the right. This leaves the midfield 3 quite open and I see Dombaxe locking down a place.

&gt;Granted the player is showing ability at such a young age, what is the appropriate time to loan someone like this out, keeping in mind Coulibaly has seen a loan at a similar age.

The loan system is amazing. Look at players like Townsend, Caulker, Rose, Walker etc. But at the same time terrible, look at Mason and Coulibaly. Question is, is the system inherently hit or miss, or does the club have to be very exact with who and how they place, I suspect it is the latter. 

I think there are a number of important requirements that need to be hit before a loan is made. Will the player get 75+mins a week? Will the player be able to play in his preferred position? Does the formation/tactics used by the club line up with how spurs want the players to develop? What reputation does the club have for developing youth? What is the quality of the coaching staff at the club? How easy is it to monitor the player at the new club? And finally, whether the loan will actually offer more in terms of player development in comparison to spurs advanced youth training facilities. Impossible to tell for Dombaxe at this point, it is tough because whilst we want out players playing beautiful football that is quite rare in championship or lower sides due to the grind nature/structure of games.",0,1375270822,null,0,false,0,cbdzdmx,t3_1jeuuj,t1_cbdzdmx,t3_1jeuuj,null,1429996740,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

I've never tried any of them as I've only moved to the UK recently, and have no relatives here. 

I think the most common way people end up ""losing"" money is a relative making you a beneficiary, and then dying without telling you. Insurance companies, pension funds, and banks have little incentive to track down beneficiaries.

They still have 15m left over that would pay for Torres' wages, plus the reported 30k per week Soldado is currently on added onto that, which is 1.5m per year.

IF Valencia put this money into wages that's an extra 9m for 2seasons, which works out at just over 173k per week. For a chance with another club and being back in Spain, he could probably quite happily take that wage cut.

* Offer your guests a cup of tea. Every time. They may decline and ask for coffee instead, which is considered fine. But even if you don't drink tea, it's a good idea to keep some in just to offer it to people. This even includes plumbers and people who come to service your house.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,null,null,"Easy to drive on the wrong side of the road but roundabouts feel weird and the buggers don't indicate. Most dangerous time where you're most likely to end up on the wrong side of the road is turning left from a T junction or crossroads or driving out of a supermarket/petrol station etc. 

Traffic lights don't have white stop lines. You're left to guess where to stop. 

Almost everyone drives at the speed limit but the roads aren't as congested. Speed cameras tend to have a big sign giving a 1km advance warning. 

When you exit a motorway or dual carriageway there are speed limit signs typically saying 50kph or less. DO NOT EXCEED IT - many of the exits have a short slow down bit and then a very sharp right bend you really don't want to be doing much than 30-35MPH round.

Motorways and dual carriageways have rest areas quite regularly but many of them are no more than a picnic area with toilets. Some of the toilets at the ones that haven't been updated are of the hole in the floor type.

Motorways, dual carriageways and national speed limit roads have two speed limits, one for dry conditions, one for wet. 

**DO NOT LANE HOG ON DUAL CARRIAGEWAYS OR MOTORWAYS**. You **MUST** drive in the right lane unless overtaking and once you've overtaken **RETURN IMMEDIATELY** to the right lane. Whilst you can drive in the middle lane of a motorway in the UK all the way from London to Leeds if you want, if you don't move back to the inside lane on a French motorway or dual carriageway after passing a vehicle to your right you can be fined. You'll see lots of French drivers leave their left indicator on as they pass a vehicle on the motorway to show they're overtaking.

There are no speed limit signs entering or exiting towns. When you pass the sign with the name of a town or village you're entering the speed limit drops to 50kph unless signed otherwise. When you drive out of the village or town you will see a sign with the name of the town with a red X through it. When you pass that then the national speed limit applies (90kph single carriageway, 110kph dual carriageway)

""Priorite a Droite"" also signed by a yellow diamond. Means give way to the right. Unlike the UK, once upon a time in France when you were driving on the main road or street you didn't have right of way over side roads entering from the right so had to stop to let cars out. Thankfully the French have realised this idea is actually ""a bit shit"" and have nearly phased it all out so you'll see a yellow diamond with a \ through it indicating priorite a droit no longer applies at that junction. 

DO NOT BUY FUEL AT PETROL STATIONS (Esso, Shell, BP etc). They are horrifically expensive like 20-30 cents a litre more expensive. Get it from supermarkets (usually Intermarche, Carrefour, Leclerc) or unmanned petrol stations. You can usually find one very close to most main road exits near towns. Install petrol station POIs on your Satnav if you can. 

Roadworks. You thought we had a lot here? They're masters of the cones over there in France.

Toutes Routes (All routes) on roadsigns. Unless you're stopping somewhere in a town where you see this, follow it. It'll take you the quickest way through the town.

Do not be offended if you see a frenchman stood at the side of the road taking a piss in clear view. Frenchmen seem to think its a right to do this and don't feel the need to try and hide their gentlemens vegetables from view when doing it. 

Then there's the usual stuff - headlight deflectors, GB sticker, hi-viz for EVERY person in the car, TWO breathalyser kits. Its rare to be stopped though. In the last half decade I've been driving in France I've not been stopped. 

Finally, **ENJOY IT**. Driving in France isn't nearly as stressful as driving in the UK once you get used to being on the wrong side of the road. ",0,1375276377,null,0,1375278118,0,cbe0gzt,t3_1jcvzd,t1_cbe0gzt,t3_1jcvzd,null,1429996228,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

I won't lie, I saw it as a good chance to gain links, contact and experience within the political sphere, but I am under no illusions that I am not going to be snapped up by a party any time soon.

As you rightly note there are two distinct items: (national) debt and budget deficit. The former tells, usually as a % of GDP, how much the state owes as a percentage of output. The latter is how much the government is spending above it's income. 

You're right to point out that during a recession or economic crisis a deficit is likely to occur as tax receipts fall. In fact it's perfectly reasonable to expect that, it should shock no-one. The problem many people have is that during the most prolonged economic boom in memory the government *still* ran deficits. In theory at worst there should have been no deficit ideally there would have been a surplus.

The reason why is linked to debt - during a growth period the government should be raking in money and have low debt such that when bad times inevitably (yeah Mr. Gordon Brown INEVITABLY) come round again the government can increase spending to offset falls in employment. We know this as [Keynesian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics)

However, if debt reaches some ceiling then repaying that debt becomes unrealistic without either default or inflation. The value of that ceiling is hotly contested and is some function of interest rates - i.e. the lower the rates the higher your debt can be before things go tits up. Greece, Italy and Japan have debts higher than 100% of GDP with the UK and US hot on their heels.

Some argue (Austrian School IIRC) that if you have your own curency it doesn't really matter what your debt ratios are since you can simply print more money. This means you never default, you always honour your debt. This is true but it hides one bloody big thing and that is inflation. If you inflate i.e. print more money then the relative value of your currency will decrease and thus savings and everyone are worse off anyway.

At the end of the day the government is only able to spend what it can earn in taxes plus whatever it can borrow on the open market (or IMF if things go very wrong) if no one is willing to lend to the government then wages will stop being paid and services will stop. It all boils down to the belief of ""the market"" that the government will honour its obligations, can be realisitically expected to do so and has a credible plan to deliver.

Fundementally, the finances of the UK are fucked. Austerity isn't some Tory myth designed to mask privitisation, though it does feel that way some times. There are two realisitic ways out of this mess - austerity or inflation.

What happens is that a lot of their couriers use their own vehicles and get paid per package, They can only fit so many packages in their car at a time so they only take the ones that are close together or where there are multiple packages to the same address, A lot of the time it isn't viable to take your package if nobody else near your house is getting anything that day, So they say you weren't in the house and try again tomorrow hoping that there will be more people near your house waiting for packages, If this happens 3 days in a row you don't get your package, It gets sent back at no cost to the courier and you lose out

true,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,"When I used to work at an FE college, I used to do these interviews. There's usually a slight discrepancy between what the teaching staff want to see, and what the management want to see.

Teaching staff generally want to make sure you've got the academic credentials, GCSE English &amp; Maths being top of the list, and some general indication that you are enthusiastic about the subject, which it seems you are. Evidence that you can go off and find stuff out off your own bat is also handy.

Management staff are more concerned about your chances of dropping out, as they get told off if the retention figures for the courses they manage drop below national averages. So if you've previously studied at A level and dropped out, they'll not be too impressed, but if you've been in work since your GCSEs, they'll be more likely to view your application favourably.

If you're thinking of a Psychology degree as a way of getting to assist those with psychological issues, then you'd be wanting to aim for something like a postgrad clinical doctorate or an IAPT practitioners course after the BSc. As is mentioned by wiggly-tuff, having a clear vision of where you want to end up, and showing you've done some research into the route is beneficial.

Yodel is just the new name for the UK branch of DHL and HDNL, they basically renamed to try and cover up how bad HDNL was.  So the DHL was the more expensive faster ""better"" service. and HDNL was the cheap as possible to send (and it showed).  There were ALOT of complaints about HDNL and it has got better since the merge, yodel still has a lot of faults though(as your story proves).

As for how to try and not use yodel and want to use amazon, as people have stated where possible just ask them not to.  Also the faster services are quite often with other couriers (yes these are more expensive).  Also another point I would make is talk to the seller all the time, if you didn't place the order with the courier directly, they don't care what you say.

The main point I would make though and I can not stress this enough, regardless of speed, with couriers you get what you pay for. If you pick the cheapest service you get it. (this wasn't with yodel)

Finally just a story if you have got this far about bad deliveries.  Once had a driver deliver to a ""safe place"", turns out they had left it in one of the bins.  On bin day.

Altough those aren't ideal choices, I do not think a replacement LB is a high priority. 

I like the idea of loaning Skrtel and signing either Papadopoulos or Alderweireld. Although Skrtel is a very solid CB and has been great for our club, I do not think he fits into the system anymore. Rodgers wants our CBs to be able play with the ball more--and that is not his game. 

Regardless of what happens with Suarez I think we need another forward. There are rumors that we are linked with someone named Kono.... I could not even begin to spell his last name. If someone can speak more on this than please do.

The huge number of racist ""jokes"" that are upvoted, there was a post last week that said black people shouldn't be able to vote, it had 700+ upvotes and gold before it was removed.

Then we have reddit's liberal use of the word faggot and complete denial that gay people might not like it. This website can be horrible at times but outside of the default subs it's usually full of civil, knowledgeable discussion. 

The last survey reddit did showed a 9:1 split of males to females, predominantly white, most subreddit surveys show a huge number of white males as well. That's not a problem but it sure skews opinions towards the whole ""white men are the most oppressed group of people"" that reddit loves.

true,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Isn't that one of the points of level NGDP targeting (Carney!)? That you can use monetary to maintain your nominal fiscal position but with controlled income growth implying a cap on inflation?

Capping inflation is not really possible since there are so many factors not least the complexity of money supply. We can try all sorts of whizzy metrics to massage the figures so we feel better about ourselves but until the government controls spending and/or economic growth improves tax receipts such that we can realisitically reduce our deficit (not debt that's a bigger issue) then frankly it's all a load of bollocks. 

Those that talk about government spending not being like a household budget are right in that it is vastly more complex and the financial instruments available to the state far exceed what a typical household has access to. But there is some truth that at some point the state must either balance the books or inflation/printing money and relative devaluation makes the nation more competitve and thus enables growth but even this has a cost e.g. making imports more expensive - which is a killer for the UK given how much we import.

It's almost like the bankers are being castigated for complex financial tools and the subsequent bust but now states, not least the eurozone and UK, are concocting all sorts of metrics to make things sound better because the harsh reality is growth cannot be sustained at previous levels.

true,stillclickin,lfc12,,"After seven goals, 27 players used and endless hours spent receiving unbridled, unconditional admiration, it is time for Liverpool to return home. This is the final boarding call for Flight 1892, and a return back to reality. 

Preseason tours of far-flung lands are many things, but they are rarely normal. 

The tours act primarily as a moneymaker, an opportunity to solidify the brand and strengthen its position in a burgeoning market; sad and cynical, but ultimately true. The secondary function is to allow these supporters to experience the rare phenomenon of Liverpool live, to see the sweat pour from the players' foreheads just mere metres away. More sweat, more emotion, more money. The bottom line, always, is the bottom dollar, pound or rupiah. 

- Usher: Liverpool's center back conundrum 

But though these tours are straightforward in intention, they are hardly normal. No bad thing necessarily, but for 10 days the club is transported into a different world. It is a world that sees players suffocated by fanatics as well as the dense, smoggy air; a world which allows 90 minutes of pyrotechnics during a friendly match against Indonesia as Istanbul is regurgitated nearly 6,000 miles away. 

Everything feels transient on tour -- but concurrently, everything is regarded as important by those who are there. The games are ultimately of little consequence with the opposition of such little quality -- they amount to little more than an hour-and-a-half grind in stifling, sauna-like conditions -- but every goal is celebrated in the stands as a title winner, every touch from Steven Gerrard accompanied with hushed acknowledgement of greatness. 

When this world of camera flashes and fanaticism is entered, the real world stops and a bubble of protection forms. There are few questions on the future of Luis Suarez, but simply of how great Melbourne is as a city; nobody is interested in the tactical nuances of the 3-0 win over Thailand, but rather the atmosphere that accompanied it. Football, and all the tricky trinkets that go with it, is largely immaterial and of little interest. 

It is not a holiday for the players or manager by any means -- there is work to do and fitness to regain. There will also be sore hands and crooked smiles on that plane home after a week of obliging handshakes and photo opportunities. After that, however, little can be deduced from their time there. If anything, the deification by hundreds of thousands will have a few looking longingly at their passport. 

Alas, time spent in Asia and Australia is very much stagnant with regards to what really matters to Liverpool. That is not to admonish anybody who enjoyed Liverpool's tour -- indeed, nobody with blood running through their veins could fail to be titillated by Philippe Coutinho and his stardust football boots -- but reality returns as of now. Proof of that comes in the immediate movement for Benfica's left-sided player Lorenzo Melgarejo. 

If all the questions of Suarez, attacking midfielders, defenders and everything else in between went unuttered over the past 10 days, expect them to be asked twice as much now that Liverpool are back in England. 

How quickly then, they need to be asked, and answered, with just three weeks until the opening Premier League fixture against Stoke. After a busy, proactive start to the summer, Liverpool's efforts to strengthen the squad have stalled and stagnated. This is no reflection on effort or diligence by the club, but rather the position they find themselves in after years of malaise. With no Champions League football to entice players, Liverpool's transfer strategy appears more complicated than Brendan Rodgers' public assuredness of finding players to improve the first team. 

While those players are sourced, Rodgers must make do with what he currently has. The manager has three weeks remaining; three weeks, and three friendly games, which will give more indication of how his squad is developing. The time for autograph signing and endless smiling is over; instead, furrowed brows and bitten nails over how his 11 will look against Stoke, Aston Villa, Manchester United and beyond. 

Irrespective of Suarez's transfer situation, he will not be available until September; Daniel Sturridge, meanwhile, has not played since his injury on international duty in May. This leaves the possibility of Liverpool beginning the season with a front three of Iago Aspas, Fabio Borini and Coutinho -- a big difference from the front line of Sturridge, Coutinho and Henrikh Mkhitaryan that Rodgers envisaged last month. With uncertainty over how Borini fits into Rodgers' front line and Aspas already looking capable of infuriating and delectating within seconds, there is much to think about, and much pressure for Sturridge to find fitness. 

The attack is not the only question that needs to be answered in the next month. Ironically, after the histrionics of the club's goalkeeping situation, that position is the only one with a certain future with Simon Mignolet now the undisputed No. 1. The defence, so porous and delicate at times last season, has had only Kolo Toure added to it despite Rodgers originally wanting three fresh arrivals; the midfield, though settled, could still lack balance. 

Nobody could expect anything other than the slowing down of activity with Liverpool on the other side of the world; it is clear that most Premier League sides have quieted in the past week as they fulfill their obligations thousands of miles away. 

But the plane has touched down now; the seat belt signs are off. Welcome back to England, welcome back to reality. Liverpool have to adjust to that and continue with business, or the smiles exhibited so much in recent days will disintegrate quickly.

true,SMTRodent,,Amaretto and milk.,"I'm making bread in a breadmaker, No. 11 Sandwich Loaf. I cook myself a lot of brown rice and various beans, and roast meat from the butcher nearby.

Recipe: 

Soak beans (just beans, no barley or peas), rinse and pre-cook in stock until just soft. Drain. Cook rice in stock until just soft. Drain. Mix with the beans. To this mixture, add as many fried, chopped onions as you can sanely get away with and slightly too much garlic. Add chopped bland vegetables (possibly even fried with the onions), scraps of leftover roast meat and more stock, plus whatever spice mix seems a good idea at the time. Simmer until done, serve one portion and put the rest in the fridge or freezer to reheat as needed. If you're eating this all week, serve with a small side dish of something flavourful - chilli salad, pickled red cabbage, rollmop herring, stir fry, anything at all to keep it interesting. It should be tasty on its own, but the side dish stops it being so samey. The reason for all the faff with the separate beans and rice is that it keeps the whole thing more flavourful and with a better texture.",0,1375282601,null,0,false,0,cbe2cew,t3_1jeopl,t1_cbe2cew,t3_1jeopl,null,1429995354,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

&gt; -Absolutely. Kids can't vote, why should retards and blacks?

That could be mistaken for a very close-to-the-knuckle way of saying that black people were treated as children, as were people with low IQ, therefore highlighting the stupidity of forbidding certain groups from voting just because you don't think they're capable.

Add a large dollop of tomato puree and fry for a couple of minutes with the onions, add some black pepper and a pinch of salt, add a tin of chopped tomatoes and stir. Once its heated give it a taste and see if it needs more seasoning or a little sugar. Leave to simmer.

Prepare some seasoned flour (plain with salt and pepper added) a bowl with an egg beaten in it and on a plate breadcrumbs with parmesan, sage and pepper. 
Dip the veal (you could use pork or chicken breast if you butterfly it and bash it thinner.) dredge in the flour, into the egg and then breadcrumb, I would double breadcrumb here. 

Fry on both sides until golden then place into an ovenproof dish, place a fresh basil leaf on each piece of meat and add a bit of the sauce on the meat followed by some mozzarella. Place under a grill until its melted and all bubbly. 

Take the sauce and tear in a few basil leaves and add pasta of choice (linguine is good) serve on the side of the plate with the meat, a wedge of lemon and a little salad if you want.

It wasn't exactly planned. I did spend a long time thinking about Jack's immortality, and one day it occurred to me there was another immortal character on the show. It made me laugh.

&gt;**I also have no problem with UAF. I'd rather have them than the vacillating, immigrant hating mainstream parties that seem to be fighting over the title of who can be the most appealing to small minded bigots as is possible.** 

You might not think you have a problem with them, but you might want to check that at the door too,

The UAF and the EDL are two sides of the same coin.  The EDL might be a bunch of violent racists but the UAF is more than happy to go rolling in the streets with them (and the police trying to separate them), and they're just as happy to try breaking up political discussion and functions or to drown out any speech they don't agree with, and not just with the likes of the EDL, but that's all by-the-by.  The EDL are racist, but I have no problem recognising Azad Ali, vice chair of the UAF, as also being equally worrying. 

Never heard of him?  

He liked to attend Abu Qatada meetings and described the Mumbai terrorist attacks as not being terrorism, and he advocates the killing of British troops.  I also have no doubt what Azad Ali is doing as a vice chair, or why Ken Livingstone is willing to put up with him, and it's all political and about the votes.

------------------------


So yes, I have no problem saying that the EDL and UAF are two sides of the same coin.  I'll even go out on a limb and say the UAF is probably cause for more concern.  You see, we have this reformed police, thanks to Doreen Lawrence, to deal with the EDL.  But there's something more political about the UAF working them from behind the scenes...



The real crux is UAF isn't what they claim to be.  They're predominantly run by elements within Labour, and Labour affiliated unions.  So when Labour has a rent-a-mob to create street level disruption against political opposition, no matter what form that opposition takes, then that is *INCREDIBLE* cause for concern.

It also flies in the face of all the good work Doreen Lawrence has done.  This Labour split isn't about equality and civil rights.  It's much more militant than that, like how the trade unions used to be.  There's something much more brownshirty about it, albeit with a slightly more pinkish hue.

I'd like to posit a less-than-conventional Disney heroine: Princess Kidagakash ""Kida"" Nedakh from *Atlantis: The Lost Empire*. 

The first and most obvious distinction between Kida and the other Disney Princesses (besides being made a pariah for having a lackluster performance in the box office) is her incredible age: around **8,500 to 8,800 years**. This would trump the Doctor's age by over eight times.

So frequently you have the Doctor acting as the wiser or more experienced of his partnerships (making it less partnerships, really and more... a long series of sidekicks). By pairing him up with someone whose experienced a life even longer than his you've got a much more even dynamic of experience and authority, leading to more interesting and unique interactions.

Further, Kida (again unlike most of these other Princesses) shows an incredible interest not just in the outside world, but in actively learning about matters of science. Furthermore, she shows an enormous willingness to take responsibility as well as a keen cultural and political awareness.

All of these elements makes for a very unconventional and exceedingly interesting companion that can offer unique aspects that both complement (her intrigue in the diverse world outside of hers, her incredible age) and contrast (her fierce adherence to duty and responsibility versus the Doctor's ""hates endings"" nature) with the Doctor in interesting ways.

The fact that she's one of the few Princesses here to be both adept and willing for physical conflict and you have a capable, independent, strong female character that could easily provide the second-half to the show.

Barring Kida, probably Mulan for sharing several of the same opinions on the nature of duty, the outside world, and being independent and capable in her own right (the fact that both provide some nice racial diversity to the cast is just the cherry on top).",0,1375287904,null,0,false,0,cbe4ecy,t3_1jf8g2,t1_cbe4ecy,t3_1jf8g2,null,1429994325,29,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,29

I'm sorry, did the 1970's not happen for you? Believe it or not, there is a full compliment of 'lady-policemen' in the force to carry out searches on female suspects.

&gt;You gonna pick up that bill are you?

If a station was short of female staff to the point where they couldn't carry out a search then they are understaffed in the first instance, strip searches or otherwise.

&gt;You genuinely are an idiot there must be at least one present of the same sex, but in an emergency and life is is danger (possible suicide) then men can be used to restrain etc, as they should.

Bzzz. Wrong answer. Allow me to draw your attention to... The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code C, Annex A, B, (a), (a):

&gt;a police officer carrying out a strip search must be the same sex as the detainee (see Annex L)

&gt;the search shall take place in an area where the detainee cannot be seen by anyone who does not need to be present, nor by a member of the opposite sex (see Annex L) except an appropriate adult who has been specifically requested by the detainee;

So no, it's 100% same-sex. When it's an emergency, the requirement drops from a minimum of two to one, but a same-sex officer.

&gt;same way if i have an accident and i need to be cut out of my bike leathers, they shouldn't require a male ambulance on standby to perform it, its subject to the efficiency of the system.

It's not the same at all. In a medical emergency fractions of a second count, and paramedics have particular legal dispensations to what would otherwise be considered assault or battery. The police can rip your shirt open too if it's a medical emergency and you need CPR. A medical emergency is when your pulse or breathing needs external support to survive ""maybe she's got a blade, maybe not"" isn't a medical emergency. If someone has managed to cut themselves from a smuggled blade, then the blade is no longer hidden. If the blade has cut them while it was hidden, then the medical procedure is to leave foreign objects in situ.

When it comes to searches for hidden drugs or blades, it's not time critical and so it gives suspects greater protection of dignity.

Phoned the company, just got useless responses, and said they would redeliver next day (sat).

Sooo waited in all day again on a gorgeous sunny saturday. This time 4pm the status changed from enroute to 'attempted delivery...'. Total lie, phoned them again they said I would have to travel miles away to pick up this 40 inch tv from their delivery centre. I have no car so wasnt going to happen.

The only good side was amazon instantly gave me a full refund. I ended up buying the same TV for £40 more from Comet, who delivered it painlessly one evening after work the next week.

Also, separately family member ordered a laptop, next day delivery. Yodel again, this time they claimed they'd delivered the item when again no hide nor hair of yodel was seen. 

They're incompetent and possibly corrupt, I cant believe amazon still use them. I tend to try to buy large items from high street retailers like John Lewis or Comet who do their own delivery.

true,littlemishaps,uk,Southampton,"Yep had awful experiences with Yodel. 

For example, a few months ago I ordered something from America. They tried to deliver on a weekday when I was at work. I phoned them up and told them specifically not to try and deliver the next day because I wouldn't be home. They told me that because of the nature of the package they couldn't deliver to anywhere but the billing address, not even leave it with a neighbour, even with my permission (it was a $40 print ffs, not the crown jewels!). So I arrange for a Saturday delivery. 

Guess what? They tried to deliver the next day anyway and then sent my package back to the depot. I called customer service and was on hold for nearly an hour. They then said that I could arrange for the package to be sent back out the next week. Fine, I said. 

Over the next week there was no sign of the package - no calling card, nothing. Called customer service back up and they said that instead of sending the package out to me again, they'd returned it to customs to be sent back to America! Despite it being their policy to hold the package for at least 5 working days, they sent it back to America after two, and after having spoken to me! Ok, I said, this was your mistake, please can you get my parcel back? Well, apparently once it leaves their depot they have no way of finding out where the package is, so it was up to me to call the company I bought the item from and try and get them to resend it. From America. :/

Also, to be fair, it's at least partially down to poor performance measurement. The end performance measure should be customer satisfaction as well as successful delivery rate and a few other bits. Like others mention if they're in the bounds of the contractual KPIs then the fault partially lies with those that devised those contract measures. If you have a set of performance measures that truly reflect what's important to customers/stakeholders then your contractor will deliver to an adequate level OR you will have the opportunity to find someone else to do it for you. If the contract is designed with care then Amazon could even renew with Yodel and see an improvement in performance.

true,christianjb,null,null,"I honestly don't know, but this is what [Wikipedia tells me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Egypt):

&gt;Beginning in 2000, under Hosni Mubarak, certain laws were used to impose what amounts to a de facto ban on homosexuality and cross-dressing.
In 2000, police arrested an Egyptian gay couple and charged them with, ""violation of honor by threat"" and ""practising immoral and indecent behavior"". Their lawyer asked that the charges be dropped because homosexuality is not a crime, but the judge refused on the grounds that two men had in fact ""offended"" religious and moral standards [2]. The incident became a media sensation, promoting various public figures to view homosexuality as a product of Western decadence and demand that the government execute homosexuals or send them to mental institutions to be reformed [3].
Within a year, the Egyptian government began a public crackdown on Egyptian gay men by raiding private parties, arresting the guests and charging them with various laws, including violating the ""Public Order &amp; Public Morals"" code, enacted in the 1990s to combat ""Satanic"" and ""lewd"" expressions, as well as engaging in prostitution and ""violating the teachings of religion and propagating depraved ideas and moral depravity.""

You should read the whole article though, lest I be accused of cherry-picking.

And very recent news showing that the owner ( excentric guy with huge ego) said the deal is off and he got annoyed and will never sell Chiriches to Spurs. A reason is that they didn't want to wait 1 day longer. Team manager confirmed. Chiriches might be pissed because he already missed the chance to move to AC Milan last year. It's fishy though, I think it might be a trick to get more money for Chiriches. Roma is also bidding 6.5 mil euros.

Here's what the post says:

&gt; People seem to forget exactly why he was arrested. Mandela was the head of UmKhonto we Sizwe, (MK), the terrorist wing of the ANC and South African Communist Party. He had pleaded guilty to 156 acts of public violence including mobilizing terrorist bombing campaigns, which planted bombs in public places, including the Johannesburg railway station. Many innocent people, including women and children, were killed by Nelson Mandela’s MK terrorists

You may disagree with that point. Yet I think it's an entirely valid one to make (though I don't agree with it entirely). The next reply clears up some misconceptions in the post.

- Frees up Verts to play LB if Rose/BAE/Fryers injured
- Has a knack for scoring goals from corners/set-pieces
- Massive potential and probable future England starter
- Leaves us with three CBs - Dawson, Vertonghen and an injury prone Kaboul

Good deal. Poor timing. Should have tied up a replacement first.

And one of my most upvoted posts after he dominated RVP: (can't remember if it was against United or Arsenal now..)

[Soul ii Soul - Back To Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB54dZkzZOY), which I still absolutely adore now.

Andrew Gilligan also produced/investigated the film for Channel 4's Despatches where Azad Ali was filmed telling an undercover journalist that democracy should not come at the cost of sharia law.  Andrew Giligan wrote it, but nobody made Azad Ali say that, just as nobody made the IFE for which Azad Ali is community co-ordinator  hand out leaflets in Tower Hamlets.  Channel 4 might have reported that the leaflets stated,  
             
            ""Enjoyment through music, dance, immodesty and 
             free mixing of men and women is not the culture 
             of Islam. This is a shameless western culture."" 

but nobody made Azad Ali's IFE produce them.  Just as Mr Gilligan didn't prompt Mr Azad Ali's judge, Justice Eady, to say,  

            ""I would hold that the claimant [Azad Ali] was 
             indeed, in November, 2008, and for so long as 
             the blog remained available, taking the position 
             that the killing of American and British troops in 
             Iraq would be justified by his middle or ‘balanced’
             interpretation of jihad.""

You don't have to take it with a pinch of salt if it comes with a barrow of evidence, including video evidence, of the allegations.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYq6_5GYxBM

In this case you can't play the player not the ball, because the player's case is pretty watertight.  They got Azad on film.

&gt;**UAF weren't the ones trying to attack me and my friends for who we are. I have no issues with UAF.**

See that's the difference between us.  

The EDL weren't directly attacking me, but that doesn't mean I don't have real issues with them.  They don't directly attack me, but they attack others and as such they attack values I share.  Ergo, I have an issue with their authoritarianism.  

Tommy Robinson is knuckle-dragging Islamophobe thug who just happens to be slightly more erudite than the other rank-and-file knuckle-draggers; someone who likes to portray all Muslims as militant Islamists, extremists, and a cultural threat.  The flipside is the UAF happen to not only turn a blind eye to Azad Ali, but to openly promote him to the position of vice-chair. 

In a *the enemy of my enemy is my friend* vein, the living caricature Tommy Robinson likes to erroneously project onto large groups is welcomed by the UAF.  One is Islamophobic, the other propagates and is blind to militant Islamism.  

Both are aspects of the same problem.

The difference is you apparently don't have a problem as long as its not directed at you personally.  The problem I have, with all authoritarianism and intolerance, is on the grounds of my own self-preservation.  That on the understanding that if you let one aspect fester then it's only a matter of time until their Sauron-style eye of authoritarianism is looking in your own direction.  I've never been a victim of groups like Combat 18 either, but I sure as hell have an issue with them.

Now, you say Doreen Lawrence is an amazing woman.  Agreed.  However, if she's not being politically manipulated but she has your approach to authoritarianism and corruption, where you *'have no issues'* as long as it doesn't directly affect yourself, then there is a problem.

The real problem is that Doreen Lawrence, the name, is becoming a writ of approval.  A rubber stamp.  Almost a *Don't criticise us, we have a Doreen Lawrence.*  Or more worryingly: *vote for us, we have a Doreen Lawrence*, irrespective of policies which Doreen Lawrence may never have had a hand in.  Why a Labour peerage?  She doesn't have to be party affiliated.   Is her name be used by Labour to appeal to a specific section of the electorate irrespective of policies?

Just as people who support UAF without knowing the background are being used.  

Just as the Bengalese people in London are being used.

Just as distasteful as driving a van around parts of London with the Orwellian message of *illegals go home or else, signed, your government*, Labour appears to be playing ethnic politics and it is very, very dangerous.  Cynicism in this case is warranted because we already have Ken Livingstone and the Labour Unions willingly moving in the same circles as Azad Ali. 

&gt;**We should be celebrating this, instead of trying to poison her appointment.**

Unless the reason for her appointment is to create a Teflon Labour party which people feel they can't criticise.  You've kinda just said it, Doreen Lawrence is an amazing woman (and she is) but don't tell me that means I have to then turn a blind eye to the fact that she's also now a Labour appointed peer, and a distraction from some pretty sinister political maneuverings on *their* part.

You don't get a free pass for being a bigot simply because you couch your reprehensible beliefs in polite language. 

The top rated responses to that post don't simply clear up misconceptions; they utterly destroy his argument. The gullible fools I was speaking of need to get over this idea that all viewpoints are respectable and valid arguments. The guy is arguing from a place of prejudice. From a place of white supremacy. This bias is clear in his post and it was posted utterly dishonestly. 

The same goes for all the ""hey Hitler wasn't such a bad guy"" posts that have popped up all over the place recently. I know everyone simply thinks they're being logical and unbiased and approaching the subject with a detatched emotional lens, but what it is in actuality is nothing more than juvenile contrarianism. Blind pandering to controversial white-washings of history masquerading as intellectual discussion. And in every single one of these threads the main proponents of these ideas, or at least the ones agreeing most ardently, always turn out to have other posts in places like /r/niggers or r/whiterights. What a coincidence. Racists on this website have learnt _very well_ how to make their beliefs appear reasonable; and reddit falls for it _every single time_.

And this is the crux of the matter. Strip away the artifice of intellectual debate and put it in human terms. It may all appear like reasonable subject for debate if you're looking at it from the perspective of a straight white man who's never had to deal with any of this stuff in their every day lives.

Imagine being a Jewish person logging on and seeing a thread about how great a public speaker Hitler was and how some of his political ideas were revolutionary for the time. Imagine being a woman logging on to the website and seeing a video on the front page of a woman getting beaten up and all the comments loudly proclaiming something along the lines of ""equal rights, equal lefts!"" or perhaps maybe ""DAE think it's so sexist that men aren't allowed to hit women?"".

There are a lot of ""truths"" about Islam which if you were to criticise publically in this country could end up resulting in your death. We have politicians in this country trying to outlaw blasphemy to appease their constituent voters. We see an evergrowing trend of people that hold extremist views (or at least sympathise with them). I have made valid criticisms of that cult here on Reddit and it's greatly interesting to connect with others who feel the same. My concern is the day will soon come where places like this website will be the only place I can express my views without fear of retribution.

For me the internet represents a great freedom that we have in this world. We have the luxury to be exposed to a variety of different beliefs, express our own beliefs and have them challenged by others. There will be people in this world who will use this freedom to spout language that many of us will find abhorrent. I don't think it's a bad thing to be exposed to that language and to understand it.

It's on a 12 month contract since customers upgrading from the 40mbps infinity to the ~80mbps had to do so on contract.

BT have generally been alright, but there is a notable exception which might be relevant to you. When I was moving in, I ordered the connection to be set up immediately. The line was in use at the time by the current tennant (though they had requested their transfer) and this caused the order to be cancelled. I wasn't informed about it at all, it just wasn't installed. I called to complain and the next ordered was also cancelled. It took a few talks with their complaints department to sort it out and credit my account for the days I had paid for. In fairness, this could happen with any provider though it was BT specifically in this case.

One other issue is that they now charge for paper bills. Apparently this is common with other ISPs but its a pain in the arse either way.

Well, we tried peace and happiness, there's only one thing for it.

A war of extermination which destroys the native population and replaces them with our discarded shallow end of the gene pool.

Considering we sent our religious people to America and they did okay, and we sent our convicts to Australia and they did well, and our Sheep-shaggers to New Zealand and they did brilliantly, I suggest we sent the EdL and the bNP to France and see what they can do. Either they'll kill each other off, die from starvation, or follow the trend by magically creating a british Utopia.

Either way, we're better off.  &amp;#12494;( &amp;#94;_&amp;#94;&amp;#12494;)

true,TwelveBore,cnty-england,England,"&gt; You see this is the sort of nonsense I'm talking about. It's as if so long as no one actually comes out and says ""I hate black people"" they can expect to have their unbelievably racist opinions respected and debated.

It's a perfectly acceptable opinion to hold. You do not have to be a racist to consider Nelson Mandela a terrorist. He signed off attacks that resulted in the death of many innocent civilians. Now we can sit here and understand the reasons for this and the social conditions that existed at the time, but that's part of educating people and engaging in open debate. 

You have to get used to the fact that not everybody thinks the same as you, and that people hold opinions you consider to be abhorrent.


&gt; You don't get a free pass for being a bigot simply because you couch your reprehensible beliefs in polite language.

Who are you, the thought police? 

&gt; The top rated responses to that post don't simply clear up misconceptions; they utterly destroy his argument. 

Then what's the problem? He had his argument defeated. That's debate.


&gt; The gullible fools I was speaking of need to get over this idea that all viewpoints are respectable and valid arguments.

They may not be ""respectable"" but they have the right to be heard just the same as every other ""viewpoint"" that exists.

&gt;  The guy is arguing from a place of prejudice. From a place of white supremacy. This bias is clear in his post and it was posted utterly dishonestly.

So fucking what? Plenty of people argue from a place of prejudice and hold biased opinions. It's very rare you meet non-biased people. He has the right to debate his argument, you do not have the right to prevent him from doing so.

&gt;  The same goes for all the ""hey Hitler wasn't such a bad guy"" posts that have popped up all over the place recently. I know everyone simply thinks they're being logical and unbiased and approaching the subject with a detatched emotional lens, **but what it is in actuality is nothing more than juvenile contrarianism**

In your opinion. Would you stop people from holding that view? Would you ban or censor people from holding that view? If so, you may be able to sympathise with Hitler more than you think.

&gt; What a coincidence. Racists on this website have learnt very well how to make their beliefs appear reasonable; and reddit falls for it every single time.

Once again this is your opinion. They probably feel the same about you and your arguments. 

&gt; So imagine being a black man logging on to this website and seeing a white supremacist revision of history as the top comment on a post about Nelson Mandela.

It's a valid fucking argument to make. Being a white supremacist does not nullify that. Does it make him biased? Yes. Yet he wasn't uploaded because he gave a white supremacist revision of history. He was upvoted because he claimed Nelson Mandela did horrible things that others also agree on. He was then refuted by many other posters. 

This reminds me of Christopher Hitchens (who was of partial Jewish descent) defending David Irvine (historian who claims the holocaust never happened) from being censored. Irvine has a vast knowledge of that period and has done some great research into WW2. It just so happens he also thinks the Holocaust never happened. Hitchens stated that David Irvine had the right to express those opinions and should not be arrested for doing so. I take that line of approach also.

&gt; Imagine being a Jewish person logging on and seeing a thread about how great a public speaker Hitler was

You probably couldn't find a single Jewish person that would disagree with that point.

&gt; Imagine being a woman logging on to the website and seeing a video on the front page of a woman getting beaten up and all the comments loudly proclaiming something along the lines of ""equal rights, equal lefts!""

That depends entirely on the video. If the woman started the physical confrontation, then that would generally be the response. Yet those comments would not be tolerated if the video depicted a man attacking a woman for no reason.

Most women I have spoke to agree that a woman has no right to hit a man, and vice versa.

I come on Reddit and see things that offend me all the time. I used to go on 4chan as a kid and see stuff that offended me. 

I frequent /r/AskHistorians and other history-related subreddits and one common topic that arises is how Winston Churchill was a scumbag who was just as bad as Hitler. These comments often come from Indian redditors who misconstrue a certain event in history. It offends me that people would speak of somebody I hugely admire in such a way. Yet I understand the point of view and either try to rectify it or ignore it completely.

I believe the vast majority of users on this website to be level headed intelligent people.

&gt; Do you see yourself logging back in under those circumstances? Many don't. And that's the problem.

If they're unwilling to see the existence of arguments that offend them, or at the very least unwilling to ignore them whilst continuing to use this website, then they are doing themselves a huge disservice.

true,kharmael,uk,Bucks,"Hello, RAF Pilot here.

Almost the entirety of the UK is part of the UK Low Flying System. This means that military fixed wing aircraft can fly around at (best effort) 250' above the ground almost wherever they want.  

Obvious areas where they won't do this is over large populated areas and any other areas of habitation that they can dodge.  They won't low fly inside airport control areas (generally within 2.5 miles of an airport) or overhead pre-defined avoidance areas (such as nature reserves, hospitals, power stations, areas of constant noise complaints etc).  The reason that you don't tend to see them much around East Anglia, The South East and Central England is that there really isn't much space to fly round there, and what space there is contains lots of hazards that could get one into trouble, and frankly it's a dull part of the world to low fly.  

On occasions that we do decide to head into these areas, be it for weather purposes or just for shits and giggles, then don't worry about the aircraft just because you haven't seen one before.  I would also urge people not to immediately ring up the RAF and report it or complain about the noise unless you are genuinely disturbed.  The reason I say this is because every phone call prompts an investigation by the RAF Police and it involves lots of painful admin!

Wow, what an awkward beginning to the article. He's clearly trying to find a subtle putdown, but didn't get around to not making it not sound like a whiny schoolchild insult.

Continuing through the rest, I'm disappointed..the entire article is the repeated statement 'free schools are good!' intertwined with insults to Ed Miliband. It's clearly a propaganda piece rather than a proper analysis, but I guess I find that vaguely annoying in itself.

Edit: To be clear, I'm happy to believe free schools can and do do well, but I'd like a more thorough analysis than that the first few have succeeded. Gove doesn't go deeper than that here (nor does he have to, it's not the goal of the article), but I'd want to be very careful before saying that their being free schools is the deciding factor rather than some particular part of the process (stuff like potentially different funding) or sampling bias in which schools were selected for the new status.

The club is doing well in the league and will participate in the CONCACAF Champions League after it won the Canadian Championship. 

We have signed some high profile players from Europe, mostly from Italy where our Italian-Canadian owner has lots of contacts. These players include Alessandro Nesta, Marco Di Vaio, Matteo Ferrari and Nelson Rivas. 

More recently, we have signed a second designated player (a player whose salary is higher than the maximum salary allowed and doesn't count towards the salary cap) in Hernán Bernardello, a DM who played for Almeria. We also signed a Spanish defender named Adrian Lopez who was contracted to Wigan for the past two seasons. These signings signal a new direction for the club, because they are both 26 and not aging stars. 

After every victory, the club releases behind the scenes footage of the match.

I think this is true. We need to move on as a country. Not forget what happened, but accept that times have changed and need to continue to change. We need people who were born into peace, who don't bear the scars of the troubles, to take key positions in driving forward this peace. The divisions built into our society cost upwards of 1 Billion per year to maintain, even when it is a small minority who demand them. 

Now, in fairness all that is easy for me to say. I grew up in a peaceful area unaffected by the troubles, and attended two integrated schools. I am from a mixed family. I recognise that people still hurt from the past, and there are still communities torn apart by conflict.

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"Its a Section 59 warning. It's a bit different to an ASBO. An ASBO actually takes quite a lot of evidence to apply to a person. There have to be a lot of repeated courses of behaviour which in and of themselves amount to ASB that is causing harassment, alarm or distress to a person of another household. An ASBO is in fact a civil injunction which carries a criminal arrest power.

Section 59 is a bit different because the threshold is lower and pertains to vehicles and the manner in which they're used. Excessive engine revving is one of the factors that can trigger section 59. If there are two 59s in a 12 month period then the vehicle may be seized.

The commenter on the TIL thread was a white supremacist racist twat, and you're falling for the 'reasonable' tone of his comment, despite it being factually inaccurate and misleading.

If you read the indictment he linked to, Nelson Mandela was only convicted of sabotaging various government installations and conspiring to commit guerilla warfare. As anyone who's lived in a country which has been colonised can tell you from history -- these sort of charges are par for the course for any freedom fighter.

In 1962, Mandela was imprisoned. All the civilian deaths due to bombings by the Umkhonto we Sizwe happened in the 80s -- well after Mandela was incapable of being operationally affiliated with them.

I am assuming since you disagree with the posts and its defenders so much you would prefer it if people listened to you, and you were therefore able to influence their opinions. This is much less likely to happen if you insult them, and as a result of this have a high level of downvotes.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"well the hiphop forums i've used which are predominantly black do have a far higher instance of that word but it's entirely beside the point, certainly when you consider the various definitions and usages associated with it.  
  
the point i'm trying to make is reddit is huge and nebulous - there are a lot of non-white, non-male, non-heterosexual people who use reddit every day and enjoy the experience; you probably don't even notice them because when you see their text you make an assumption they're WASP[m] -it's not like black people write in a different colour ink.  
  
and you've probably never even heard of most the gay subs which exist, i mean did you even know there's a gay gone wild? [/r/LGBTGoneWild]?  
  
i don't think most people really understand how huge reddit is, they hang around the kids subreddits during the summer holidays and notice a lot of people acting like juveniles or they get linked to a terrible subreddit with fifty users (most of who are various trolls many alts anyway) and they think it sums up the entire place - but they completely ignore the many nestled communities which have high-brow discourse or are specifically focused towards a minority interest; there are seventy five thousand people subbed to a single pro LGBT sub reddit, yet you're speaking as if the subscribers to /r/fag are in the majority (there are fifteen of them)   
  
no one is saying that the rude trolls aren't awful people, however to think that some juvenile idiots have managed to make reddit a toxic environment in which none but the whitests men dare tread is stupid.  
  
and let's be honest, maybe it's simple a case of no one wants to play with the squares?  reddit is a site for dullard office workers, statically the odds that someone who has a job which allows them to slack off all day on reddit is also white are kinda staggering - that's because our whole society has been hugely racist for hundreds of years and it's taking a long time to put that behind us, you simply can't blame reddits demographics on anything but society.",0,1375304334,null,0,false,0,cbeb7mh,t3_1jf4wj,t1_cbeb7mh,t1_cbe9qfa,null,1429991146,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"&gt;It's a perfectly acceptable opinion to hold. You do not have to be a racist to consider Nelson Mandela a terrorist. He signed off attacks that resulted in the death of many innocent civilians. 

Utterly, utterly false.

&gt;He has the right to debate his argument, you do not have the right to prevent him from doing so.

No one's trying to prevent anyone from doing any such thing. What should be happening, though, is that the argument should be dismissed and destroyed and not showered with two thousand upvotes and gilded.

&gt;You probably couldn't find a single Jewish person that would disagree with that point.

Do you not think there should be, perhaps, maybe, just a little bit of cultural sensitivity when venerating despotic murderers of millions? I don't know, perhaps the whole murdering millions thing ought to perhaps overshadow their prowess as a motivational speaker. In any event, the point of the example is not given just so you can pick it apart to deny that cultural insensitivity on reddit exists. The point is that someone seeing those sorts of threads and arguments all over their front page is not going to make them want to stay.

&gt; Most women I have spoke to agree that a woman has no right to hit a man, and vice versa.

And now you're doing it again. The point is not whether or not any particular person deserved violence; the point is that threads with thousands of comments cheering a woman getting beaten up _for any reason_ comes across to any casual observer as being wildly misogynistic. The fact that threads of this nature hit the front page with alarming regularity should alert you to the fact that misogyny on this website exists. It should be seen as a possibility as to _why_ so few women post here relative to men.

&gt;I come on Reddit and see things that offend me all the time. I used to go on 4chan as a kid and see stuff that offended me. 

Do you want a medal?

&gt;If they're unwilling to see the existence of arguments that offend them, or at the very least unwilling to ignore them whilst continuing to use this website, then they are doing themselves a huge disservice. 

The number of threads complaining about black on this website is really something. It boggles my mind how often redditors complain or joke about black people. Here are some of the things I've seen written about them. They don't tip. They walk out in front of traffic. They're loud when they go to the cinema. They talk funny. They complain about racism. They benefit from affirmative action. They are allowed to say ""nigger"" without being racist. They're illiterate. They can't swim. They love chicken and watermelon. They pull the race card. ""Niggers gonna nig"". They look like chimpanzees. They commit a lot of crimes. They beat people up. They're broke. They have no respect. It's not their race I hate, it's their culture.

Coates might leave, but is he that much of an upgrade on Kelly Wisdom? His years loan at Swansea is paying dividend here. His exposure on that loan makes him a 8million player. Ingelthorpe  was at spurs when they loaned him out, so I'm hoping we will see more loans. Coady has gone, if we get the new LB, then another loan for Robinson would be good. Reserves is pointless for Flanagan as well. Sama was on our pre season tour last year, so he has obviously stagnated the past year, so maybe a loan for him as well.

Edit: Papa is a different case. Yes he's the same kind of age as Coates, Kelly and Wisdom, but he's a class above Coulker.

Teix is one of the older reserves with potential (20) but I understand why he won't go on loan because of his injury. Looking forward to seeing how he does this year.

Will be interesting following the loan deals this year, especially Suso. Almeria got up to the La Liga via playoffs I believe, so being on eof the weaker La Liga sides a fully expect Suso to hold down a first team role, and will stream some/many of their games.

Mandela was one of the founders of MK (Umkhonto we Sizwe), this is something he stated himself during his trial. So that is not in doubt, the question is then what acts MK carried out. The [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umkhonto_we_Sizwe) discussed a number of bombings linked with the organisation but let's start by looking at one of them as too much detail makes discussion impossible and allows non-specific dismissal.

The Church Street bombing was one were the evidence would seem to be fairly strong that MK members carried out the bombing as they were killed by their own bomb and their identities were known as a result.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Street_bombing

Now perhaps there are legitimate counter points or areas of doubt, I'd be interested to know what those are but I don't think the violence commited by MK, of which there was a considerable amount, can easily be dismissed as not having happened.

1) We hate Derby.  
2) Familiarise yourself with Mull of Kintrye. Sing loud and proud, substituting 'City Ground' where applicable.  
3) 79-80, these were the glory years, where we won league and european cups (x2!)  
4) Brian Clough  
5) Next semi-successful era was Frank Clark in the mid-90s. Finished 3rd in PL, club stars including Stan Collymore, Stuart Pearce et al. Quarter Finals of UEFA cup, before roundly annihilated by Bayern Munich.  
6) Recently, we have been propped up by our old chairman Nigel Doughty (RIP). He gave funding out of his back pocket (some would argue he failed at critical times / had poor support staff such as Mark Arthur et al). He then died, and the club was without owner and facing collapse, despite recent brushes with play off success.  
7) Enter the al-Hasawis, our new Kuwaiti owners of one year. They initially stood by then manager Sean O driscoll, a mild mannered but well respected coach and it seemed refreshing that big money owners weren't going to go and get someone stupid like expensive ex-England manager Steve Mclaren (as had happened when Billy Davies was sacked formerly due to disputes with the Board and despite playoffs, and we spiralled into avoiding relegation). Only Sean O Driscoll didn't win enough games, so they went and got the expensive manager after all, only after 9 games and 1 win, he quit and we got Billy back.  
10) Now, Billy has spent a lot of money on whoever he wants and I'm sure that success will be absolutely demanded.  

Current crop - there is still some old dross in the team from Steve McClaren days, who basically re bought his old club but a few years later - Miller / Greening et al. 

Exciting prospects - Djamel Abdoun, no idea what he is like but playing in a team that beat Arsenal is OK by me. Jamie Paterson, young and a good prospect. 

Old crop - Still plenty to see from Simon Cox in terms of goalscoring and potentially henderson, maybe lacking the collymore / David Johnson of the current era.

Concerns - Billy has a history of forgoing youth, so promising young players (Darlow / Lascelles) may not get the experience they need to develop and may go elsewhere. Some good players in the academy like Blake and it would be a shame to see them follow the bamford route (youth player who went to Chelsea for £1.5m).

Is a retort to the previous, downvoted comment, ""Looks like he discovered the tranny community, which is possibly even worse."" Besides which, it's not bigotry to say that a group of people are mostly OK - ""Redditors are mostly OK"" - is that biased against redditors? I don't think so.

&gt; And my problem with the two you posted was MRAs ignorance and hypocrisy on transgender issues where they claim to care about them and then do nothing when the topic comes up saying Well treat everyone the same and pretend it's all good!

The MRM is not primarily about transgender issues, just as feminism is not primarily about mens' issues, the animal rights movement is not primarily about human issues, etc. However the author of the comment clearly stated if someone identifies as a man, they should have the support of the MRM: ""The MRM is for the rights of men.

Mignolet as our keeper may not be 100% but I feel he has great potential to be a great keeper.

You say we only have 1 CB, but as far as I know Toure has been great before (although he is getting a bit on, his experience and quality is immense), aside from him and Agger, Skrtel should not be thrown away yet. A CB could improve us, but I don't know if that is something that will make our break this season.

Stewart Downing is a good squad player but it seems that he is being replaced by Aspas for now, later on by a youngster. Room for improvement but again I don't know if we should be just throwing money at various talent in hopes of improving a solid spot in the team.

Gerrard, Lucas are top 4, Allen and Henderson are improving, and depending on the positioning next season Coutinho could be taking over that spot as an attacking midfileder.

Sturridge and Suarez are our strikers with the option of Borrini and Aspas playing that position as well. 

I trust Rodgers judgment but also I trust what I saw last season from many players and while I don't think we are top 4 for sure we do have a chance and I do believe that it is greater then in the years past.

Nobody's dismissing the MK violence as not having happened. The bulk of them (including the Church Street one) happened in the 80s when Mandela had been in prison for over 20 years, so stating that he was responsible for the civilian deaths resulting from those acts puts the burden of proof on those making the claim that he was still involved with the MK operationally at that point.

The Johannesburg railway station bombing mentioned by the commenter on the TIL thread is a common inaccuracy in that bit of copy-paste -- it was by a [member of the African Resistance Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frederick_Harris).

Suprisingly tou may find, who profits the most from this activity at least in the short term during the exploration and appraisal stage is the support and the service companies. At least that has been my experince in australia. The first dozen plus wells will be money losers for the operating company running into the tens of millions of pounds as it is unlikely that a) they will produce enough b) keep costs low enough be profitable c) have an infrastructure network to be tied into.

The guys making the money will be the drilling company, the likes of ensign and others , the construction crews to build the pad, the access roads, the testing companies like Expro, the logging companies like slb, baker, halliburton (boo hiss) , the stimulation companies (booooo) like slb, halliburton, the water haulage companies, the water supply companies, the accomodation, the cooking staff, the fuel suuply, the 3rd party machine hire, not to mention the multidue of consultants from PR to technical input.  Thats who will be gettingnthe money.  The actual company paying for all this is unlikely to recover their costs ofnthesei tial wells.  What theynare hoping for is that it will generate nough interest to either drive their share price hire and /or get someone with deep pockets to buy in and develop this project. Only then (say 10/15 years) from now will money be made from the actual gas from the wells start to make money as suffcient numbers are drilled, infrastructure is built, costs are driven lower and the gas is sold on the market.

The all of course assumes that the shale is suitable for producing from, poland is an example of where interest has petered out rather quickly after disappointing results.

Letting him go would be very silly. We could not replace him with the 85m, and even if we could...we could never pay the wages of that player. Not until the 400m stadium arrives anyway.

Islam as a religion is inherently flawed more so than Christianity, it enforces a belief of a life encompassing commitment, which Christianity hasn't done for hundreds of years. That commitment means the idea of everything in life abiding by those rules, through political enforcement is not a terrible thought, which leads to a Theocracy, which as you state is not a good thing. 

Now, you're arguing that not all Muslims are like this, which is true, they're not. But if you were to look at it statistically, a larger percentage of Muslims would prefer a theocratic state than vs the same portion of Christians. 

Now I'm not saying anything about people, people in general are good regardless of religion. But in terms of the effect a Religion can have on the political landscape? Islam is definitely worse than any western Religion on that front - Christianity tries to oppose things like gay marriage, in most Islamic states being gay is punishable by death. (Again!

If you want to get out to the countryside, take the [S3 bus to Blenheim Palace in Woodstock](http://www.stagecoachbus.com/pdfs/XOAS003.pdf). You can wander around the huge grounds for free and visit the house if you're interested. Or to see more of the countryside you could stay on the bus to Chipping Norton. Bus is about £6 return to Woodstock. If you have access to a computer while in the UK, you should watch [this documentary about Blenheim and the Duke of Marlborough](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-aristocrats/4od#3488307) who lives there - very entertaining...

Then walk down the other side of the river and stop in Binsey on the way back (and visit the Perch pub, and Binsey church). It takes about 90 minutes to walk to Wolvercote.

as i have said repeatedly, yes in some areas of reddit especially those frequented mostly by teenagers and the illeducated there are homophobic sentiments expressed and problematic language used - however to pretend this is true for the majority of reddit is disingenuous, most of reddit is very progressive, very polite and very friendly towards all humans; at least the most bits i frequent.  
  
stop going to the worst corners of reddit and instead go to the best corners, as marius jacob the french anarchist said 'The right to live isn’t begged for, it’s taken.' - sometimes i think some people spend so much time trying to find reasons to hate reddit they've never even looked at the awesome bits, then then i remember that these people are probably crazy and would only ruin all the nice places anyway.... :P",0,1375313099,null,0,false,0,cbeeklu,t3_1jf4wj,t1_cbeeklu,t1_cbee1iq,null,1429989506,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"Here's what happened to me (copypasta from a thread yesterday).

The 'work programmes' are a complete joke as well. Yes, they are a better chance at work possibly but their motives for finding you work are not all warm and fuzzy. I was told upon attending my first interview after temporary work that, and I quote ""i was a priority because we won't get our money if we don't find you a job.""

I was offered a work trial at a local hotel and jumped at the chance of employment, a chance to show willingness and to keep the job centre happy. I asked for some details of the job but little was available apart from the location and what time I was expected to attend the placement. 

So, I did attend and i did find the work quite pleasant working at the hotel bar which I'd never done before. Then came the inevitable spanner in the works. Right at the end of the placement, I was told the working hours exceeded 12PM at night and my last bus was before 12PM. So, I told the manager of my predicament and I told him I would like to refer to the work programme before making a decision which he accepted.

I asked about help with travel because a taxi was the only way home each night and the cost would be around £10, which would be nearly half of the wages collected after a four hour shift. They couldn't help me and to be really honest, I didn't feel like going to work for four hours for £14 which would mean that after tax and NI, I would make well less than the dole for a week.

Now this is where it gets shitty. The work programme and my advisor completely ignored me because I'd turned down a job (I never turned it down because I was never contacted by the hotel). I tried phoning up, emailing them and leaving messages to no avail. I kept this up for almost a week and then contacted the job centre to inform them of the situation. I have now been sanctioned because I've 'failed to attend' the work programme even though I've not been contacted and I've been ignored when attempting to open dialogue.

Once the work programme find out you're not a dolt and you've expressed some intelligence and disgust at their motive, they will make things difficult for you and they don't give a shit whether the job they've thrust you into is not financially viable.

I've sent some emails to them telling them that I've recorded all attempts at contact and told them I'm going to make sure you get the same amount of shit I have because they deserve it. They don't care about your personal circumstances, they want you in a job (any job) so they can collect their money, which I found out is £250 for employment lasting a certain amount of time and over £2000 for over six months employment.

We may not have 11 world class players for our starting 11, but we're building it. Suarez, Gerrard, Lucas, Coutinho, Sturridge, Mignolet, Agger &amp; Johnson are all top 4 players no doubt about it.
