true,LeTouche,num30-away,,"Not really at all to be honest.

Jake is a bigger slower version of Scotty. He is really sub-par at tackling, passing, almost all disciplines of the CDM role he's supposed to fill. 

Scotty provides a doggish belligerence, with the tackling ability and stamina of a god. Jake is leagues below.

At least Huddlestone can pass. He's a bit of a master at distributing to the wingers, and although he's slow at doing so, often slowing the game down, he is better at Jake. MUCH better at defending too, he's a defensive midfielder who distributes from the back, he's a version of Jake who can pass and tackle.

I agree Tom Carroll plays a different role to those two, a more technical passing role, think a really young Luka, but he's better at distributing at the back than both Hudd and Jake, and he's more doggish, nippy, and frustrating like Scott than the others too.

I don't think it's ridiculous to compare defoe with manu or the geordie bastard big Andy, at all. We do it all the time in this sub. Practically 1 in 2 submissions are about a new striker, comparing options, poacher vs target man. When they play the same position, they have to be compared to each other.

The point is, I really don't think Jake is up to playing against inter. He was appalling vs liverpool, I never saw him once on the ball, and I'd have much preferred to have seen Lewis on the right with Moussa in the middle, taking Jake, an obvious weak link, out of the game completely. I think Moussa would have been best served trying to intercept the liverpool style in the centre than Jake's slow running, and lazy defending.

with that said, if we can't sell him and get someone in to replace him in the summer, i'd be ok with keeping him as he's been showing signs of improvement -- which i'm cautiously excited about because it just doesn't compensate for all the bad performances in the past (yet).

Even in the documentary you can see how cold he was to Andy and his air of indifference as Andy pleaded for minutes. Andy got a goal with the few minutes he got. Come on, not even HALF a season with Carroll? Cole was an even lazier more expensive bloodsucker yet he got playing time. At least Carroll wanted to try to win his favor. If he didn't work for that half season, then put him on loan or sell him. 

This subreddit is patient with its manager but not its players. I don't get it. ""A few performances don't impress me when he was subpar the rest of the season."" And everyone believes it. i couldn't believe my eyes when i read all the negativity over Sturridge. HURR HES SELFISH ALWAYS SHOOTS NOT A TEAM PLAYER ETC. same shit every thread. Now that he's here everyone is in love with him. i mean COME ON. 

Carroll was in good form the last 10 games or so (consistently too), and Downing, despite never had an assist or goal in the PL, provided width and presence in both attack and possession. Not to mention the ENTIRE FUCKING TEAM sucked major balls last year (which I attribute to Dalglish and his poor tactical skills). How we got to two finals and a cup we have no clue except classic liverpool determination.

Yet when Rodgers took over and downing was somehow not sold over the summer, his play had become tons better and more dangerous. I could only imagine what Carroll could have done, ESPECIALLY when Borini was injured the first time around. He would have taken those shots with his left foot thanks to sterling and Suarez and the occasional header from set pieces. Who knows he could have flicked a few assists to Suarez on the break, and trapped the long balls from Gerrard.

Sorry I'm just ranting at this point.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Seriously? Parker is not the second coming of Zinedine Zidane. He's a *very* limited CDM who's not good in possession; against Lyon, their entire strategy was ""jump scotty when he has the ball"" and it worked so well we had to have Moussa &amp; Holtby drop deep to pick the ball up from our center backs. Scott Parker is, in fact, the wind up car of football; he crashes into things and only goes the direction you point him. There was a moment in the liverpool game, late on (after we went down 3-2) where we were trying to move the ball up the field, and Dawson passed to Scotty, who had 20 yards of space behind him &amp; upfield; no defender for ages. Jan raised his arm and visibly pointed towards the opposition goal; Scotty, afraid to turn his head for fear of seeing his shadow, calmly passed sideways to BAE, who had a scouser all over him, and could only hoof it forward.

That's Parker. Yeah, he tries hard and tackles a lot; Jake doesn't. But that's because Jake is better positionally than Scotty; he tries to make one tackle where Scotty would just smash in and kick at the ball until it squirted free. And i'll be the first to admit that Jake's way of doing things isn't always great; we often do need someone who's just going to throw themselves into the fray.

But Jake isn't terrible; he's getting better all the time, and I think he's actually becoming a better positional defender than Scotty. I'm not saying Jake is better than Scotty, but I think that Jake can be as good or better than Parker if he applies himself.

I'll freely admit that Parker is a much better player than Jake right now; but Scotty is 32; Jake is 23. He's just starting to come into his own as a player, while Scotty is in the twilight of his career. *This* game shouldn't be about putting our best 11 on the pitch, it should be about giving our young players a chance to prove themselves against good players, in a raucus European environment. You'll never hear my campaigning to play Jake over Scotty on a weekly basis; but *this* week, I think Jake is the better player.

This is the perfect opportunity to get our starting XI some rest and blood some youngsters in a crazy european environment like they'll have to be ready for next year.

*EDIT*; Also as I said in the other lineup thread; I feel like we should play Walker on the right wing. He will provide good width and service, and it also gives us a chance to test Walker's mental toughness; playing him out of position in a knockout game in a raucus European atmosphere. It's easy to forget, but Walker was with Aston Villa the season we played CL football, and last year when he was with us all year, the biggest european game he played in was against PAOK in Greece; in fact, the ""biggest stage"" he's been on outside the Premier League (with us, at least) is probably our last knockout game against Lyon at the Stade Gerland.

The long term benefits are outstanding, though, and I think we're already starting to see results. First, as in any sport, the ""magic"" winning strategy is never ""permanent aggression"" or ""possession at all costs."" These always bring short term success followed by predictability and opponents making successful adjustments.

The best strategy is always one that is fluid. One that gives pressure when necessary, conservative play when necessary, and takes risks that are worth taking. This is exactly what I think this system is teaching. I especially like that it functions as a complete structure of support, pressure, and possession, while at the same time at an individual level the player can be reactionary and can be conditioned to act properly once the initial learning curve is conquered.

Look at the explosion of creativity we have seen in the last month and a half. Sturridge, Coutinho, Enrique, and of course Suarez.

And honestly, I'm trying my hardest to remember, but the only disastrous backpass I can think of that Walker's had was against Liverpool. He's had his fair share of positional lapses, I'll give you that, but he was in an excellent run of form during our run of 14 matches without a loss, and last year he was outstanding, to the point where I think he's being studied more as a player and his weaknesses are being picked at more by the opposition, so at this point it basically comes down to how much work he's willing to put in to eliminate those weaknesses. He has all the physical tools to become a ridiculously good fullback, and he's got a good head on his shoulders. He just needs to develop the tactical side of his game and he could be a monster, and we've seen glimpses of it last season where sometimes he controlled the entire right flank on his own when Lennon was out and Van der Vaart was played wide. 

I don't know, I guess I just have a soft spot for Walker since the way I play is almost identical to his in theory, but I think people's opinions of him due to his poor form early in the season has carried on much longer than his form's actually warranted (and, imo, the same applies to Gallas, who still elicits groans from people when he's selected even though he's been outstanding since the Chelsea game).",0,1363237266,null,0,false,0,c8vbyds,t3_1a87kp,t1_c8vbyds,t1_c8v9i13,null,1431580221,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The cabling issue is this: when the place was built in the 1950s, it was pretty much mandatory for a work building with lots of hot lights and electricity to be built using large amount of asbestos in the walls. Sensible at the time, really. Only now it means it's almost impossible to drill any new holes in those walls, because you create asbestos dust, which kills people.

Also the existing conduits and cable runs are apparently literally so full of wires that there's nowhere to put in all the new cables that HD recordings etc require. So assuming that's all correct the building really just can't be updated any more.

true,mickey_kneecaps,null,null,"&gt; Of 159 suspects linked to allegedly false claims referred to the CPS between January 2011 and May 2012, 92% were women. Nearly half of them were 21 or under. One surprise was that in 38% of those investigations, the initial complaint of rape or domestic violence was made by someone other than the suspect. Among those under 18 it was 50% and often involved a parent.

&gt; ""It was a feature of these cases that the suspect later reported that the whole thing had spiralled out of control and he or she had felt unable to stop the investigation,"" the CPS report says.

This is interesting and basically confirms what I suspected: false rape accusations are rarely made to the police, rather they are made to friends and acquaintances in a thoughtless attempt to deflect attention for the accusers actions. I doubt that most people who make such accusations are willing to follow through with them over the full course of a police investigation and prosecution, so even if the number of false accusations are higher than indicated by the number of prosecutions not very many people go to prison based on false accusation.

To me, what this says is that the main danger to somebody falsely accused of rape is from social stigma and vigilante retribution, rather than being imprisoned. So the way to mitigate the effects of false rape accusations as a problem is for society to stop stigmatizing those who have only been accused, but never convicted of rape. If it weren't for the social stigma and the pitchforks and lynch-mobs attitude we adopt whenever we hear about a sexual crime, being falsely accused of rape wouldn't be any worse than being falsely accused of assault or theft. Reducing that stigma is the best way to deal with the problem of false accusation, and it barely involves the justice system at all.

Accordingly, the police ought to vigorously investigate rape cases. Holding back for fear that the accusation may be false does not seem appropriate, since it is hard enough to prosecute rape in any case and the chances of a false accuser holding firm in their accusation through an entire investigation, prosecution and trial are not high.",0,1363246128,null,0,false,0,c8vdq0k,t3_1a7gx1,t1_c8vdq0k,t3_1a7gx1,null,1431581016,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Mainly because the pseudo-marxist trolling has become kinda hardcore (maximreasonable and his many faces), the absence of mods has meant many posters/viewers have migrated to either more specialised subs, or here to /r/uk which has seen many many more political posts in the past few months.

Depending on the time of day, and the day - R/UK can be heavily right or heavily left. There's no correlation I can find. (I.e. same viewpoint, for instance on benefits, can be downvoted heavily one day or upvoted heavily the next.) So in my opinion I think R/UK is probably a nice 50:50 split right/left.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;A council (or housing association) home will typically have a below-market value rent, but the council or HA will still be making a profit on it. 

I'd be curious to hear a source on this.

Still though, even if they are, since council housing rates are as little as 1/3 of the market rate, if those were increased to market rates then my taxes would be lower, which I'd fully support.

&gt;The reason that the Housing Benefit bill has increased so much in recent years is that the rents in the private sector have risen so much. As I mentioned, anyone leaving a council home over the bedroom tax is likely to cost the state more in a private place.

Why? Why are we paying for the housing of so many people?

&gt;In central London, a 2-bed council place might cost £80pw, but a 1-bed private place might be £250.

Right, yet they cost the same amount to build, so who's missing out on that difference of £170 per week? Oh that's right, the taxpayer.

&gt;The unfair thing here is the fact that you can't easily get a place like that. That's what should change.

I completely disagree. I don't want the UK government running the housing market and honestly when I was starting uni and lots of fellow students were applying for council housing considered them dirty leeches.

Conditions like this could feasibly lead to distortions in the market, as is arguably occurring in London.

This line appears almost verbatim in every discussion of banker's pay.

In reality we already regulate private companies in all sorts of ways. If a private company's activities are detrimental to society then society needs to step in, in the same way we step in when a private individual's activities are detrimental.

The argument is that high pay in the banking sector, alongside lax regulation, led to the 'casino' that brought down the economy in 2007. Also, it's sometimes pointed out that high pay is attracting talent away from more productive and socially useful sectors.

You can give the money back and tell her that you will pay back what you had spent in instalments because you have no way of getting the money. If you think she will let you stay if you give the money back then this is your best option.  You will run through £2000 very quickly if you do become homeless.

You can leave and get your own place. If you present to the council as homeless they may put you into a foyer project for young people where  you will have your own flat and  there will be staff there who are like social workers. They may just put you into a council flat, but they will try their best to house you as you're so young. Don't tell them you have the option of staying with your girlfriend or any friends and family as they may consider you not to be homeless.

You could talk to friends and family and see if there is anywhere you can stay for a short while. This may give you some time to clear the air and get a better picture of your options.

First of all I would go to school and see your personal tutor or someone in student services. Tell them everything and tell them you need help, don't go through it all on your own. They will be able to give you advice which is more specific to your local area.

**You're**.. and no, I never said I was comparable to anybody. Your argument is revolving around the notion that someone with training should be allowed to break the laws that apply to everyone else. This is not currently the case in the UK (outside of someone performing their profession). You are wrong. 

*My* argument is that even with all the training in the world and decade(s) of experience in a profession - you can't be in control of every situation. You increase your chances, but these people are not invulnerable or infallible. This isn't the movies - where the hero is untouchable. 

&gt; If you were given a gun with bullets I doubt you'd even know how to load it and would injure yourself attempting to do so.

You'd be wrong to think so but again, this isn't about me. Speaking of injuring someone though - what if someone else *had* found Nightingale's weapon? They could have hurt themselves or others - *they* wouldn't have had experience. Nightgale couldn't have tried to control that situation if he wasn't there - and it was his *fault* that the weapon was there at all.

That is why he - just like everyone else - should be held accountable for what they do. We have weapons laws for a reason and a huge part of that is to safeguard against accidents. ",0,1363255127,null,0,false,0,c8vepzz,t3_1a7yfw,t1_c8vepzz,t1_c8vemiz,null,1431581488,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

By the way, I think it isn't neccessarily wrong for you to take control of the situation, and tell your mum that she can have the £2000 once you successfully get into university, but if she assaults you once, or acts up once, you are immediately going to the police and it's gone. Whilst this is happening, be prepared that she might go full crazy, and try to have a back up plan in order. Mabye even look to rent a storage unit nearby and put some of your belongings there. 

You're in a shit situation, I'm not going to lie, but just use every means that you have in taking control of it.

I live in one of those West London areas and recently saw one of the older and more vulnerable residents get pushed out of her Housing Association flat by the association so they could sell it for £600,000.  The way they went about it was pretty disgusting - not maintaining the flat's amenities and communal areas of the building, offering financial incentives informally to a person she trusted to help persuade her to move (a nun no less), then having viewings while all her stuff was still in the flat, literally two days after she agreed to move.  She now lives in a completely different area, isolated from those in the community who supported her and in a smaller property, she's not the only one too... 

'Free Market' the way you talk about it is a total oxymoron. Its not free at all.  Having a truly 'free' market where access to affordable housing means having a rent controlled market and a large amount of property that shouldn't be on the market, so a plurality of people (from a broader financial distribution than the current crop of buy-to-let portfolio freaks) have the means to live more centrally .  In many ways it is comparable to our Indian village scenario, just bc you haven't experienced it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  Also foreign buyers have bought in London for decades without disproportionately inflating the market to the detriment of social housing.  The difference is now we have a perfect storm of council property sell-offs and we're getting all the rich shitheads from countries whose economies have tanked who want to invest in London bc they pay a disproportionately small amount of tax on the property (if they bought it via overseas consortium) and can let it for a premium.  Examples of shitheadery include writing letters to get a local school playground and play scheme closed because of the noise, repeatedly calling the police on 10 year kids playing in a cul de sac, and vandalising cars that dared to park in the spot they wanted to claim for their Chelsea caravan.  The self-entitled arrogant attitude that quite a lot of new-comers bring can be quite galling and anti-social when faced with it day to day and often its bc they want to turn their street into some sort of gated community as that is what they lived in previously.  Anyway  I'm not having a go at you per se, merely stating why it can be a problem from my POV.

a) The 8-second rule. In the first 8 seconds of a change of control, press the ball winner

b) Opponent control. Did the opponent poorly control a received pass with more than one touch? If so, press

c) The line. Has the opposing team stepped over the pressing line? If so, press, otherwise stand.

There is also an entire decision tree to add at the point where it is have posession, have the ball, can't go direct with ""Keep Posession, pass and move"", and that involves opening up passing channels, ""tilting"" the formation around the pivot, creating triangles on the attacking side.

There are also more decisions around making the decision to go direct. Most games the direct option needs to met an entire set of circumstances, which also involves likelihood of winning the second ball if you don't make the direct play (which is all about positioning).

The most attractive thing to me is that a style and system is being instilled up and down the club. This has been shown to work at other clubs.

That would then give us two Joe Allen type signings of £35k per week, and two first choice first team signings of £65k per week (or 'sturridge type signings').

Add the transfer budget to fees obtained for outgoing players and we have anywhere from £35-45M, which averages at £8-11.25M per player.

Three tiers of player: 1st eleven (average wage £70k), squad player (average wage £35k), prospects (average wage £15k).

The change goes into a couple of squad players or prospects (such as a reserve keeper) at £10-25k per week and £1-4M each. These are offset by Assaidi, Pacheco, Spearing etc. being sold and a couple of the prospects going out on loan (Suso, Sterling and Shelvey stay since their wages are so low, and possibly go out on loan).

I think that is a minimum. Ability to sell Downing means a like-for-like trade. Same if Reina leaves, although his replacement would likely be on lower wages, leaving more change.

As for positions: 1st choice centerback, 1st choice forward, squad central mid, squad forward, backup goalkeeper.

Result: much stronger squad, little impact on finances. We definitely need to get more out of the resources we are spending, on the wages table we are still 4th, on the football table, well.

edit: just realized that selling Henderson, Downing and Carroll would allow us to bring in 6 squad player in wages alone. damn. can't see this not being attempted. ",0,1363256194,null,0,1363257035,0,c8vetqs,t3_1a80k1,t1_c8vetqs,t3_1a80k1,null,1431581524,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

You can certainly voice an opinion. You can even make formal complaints so your opinion is properly registered and your issue is dealt with.

Voicing your 'opinion' by saying that staff are ""incompetent twats"" is abusive no matter how you look at it. Yes it's not threatening (like the tweet threatening to blow up an airport) but it's still not necessary. Our NHS staff are severely under-appreciated - couple that with the fact that a sizeable chunk of society now feels entitled to everything - it's not surprising there's a zero-tolerance campaign on this sort of thing in the National Health Service and even for Network Rail.

&gt;If you can't accept something like this that happened then working in a customer facing environment is not for you.

&gt;
* certain resolutions must receive ""cross community support"", or the support of a minimum number of MLAs from both communities, to be passed by the Assembly. Every MLA is officially designated as either nationalist, unionist or other. The election of the Speaker,[25] any changes to the standing orders [26] and the adoption of certain money bills must all occur with cross-community support. The election of the First and Deputy First Ministers previously occurred by parallel consent but the positions are now filled by appointment; and

&gt;* any vote taken by the Assembly can be made dependent on cross-community support if a petition of concern is presented to the Speaker. A petition of concern may be brought by at 30 or more MLAs.[27] In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a given community agree, that community (or a sufficiently large party in that community) can exercise a veto over the Assembly's decisions.",0,1363258737,null,0,false,0,c8vf2y9,t3_1a7lyb,t1_c8vf2y9,t1_c8vexh9,null,1431581648,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6

As both /u/rainator and /u/DogBotherer have alluded to, the BBC swings with whomever is in power, due to the very nature of the organisation. If your main job is to cover British politics, you are naturally going to cover the governing party in greater detail and with higher prominence. Hence why I think the BBC went from seeming relatively leftist during the early Blair days to gradually verging more and more rightwards during the later Blair, Brown and, ultimately, Cameron years. 

To tell the truth, these days, I'd say it is verging more on the right than the left, but, in the same breath, I think this is due to the nature of the organisation itself, rather than a deliberate agenda.

No. GB is just the island, which goes from Corrachadh Mòr in the west to Lowestoft Ness in the east (Yay, East Anglia!). Keith Inch is the most easterly point on the Scottish mainland, and it's only just to the East of the midway point between Corrachadh Mòr and Lowestoft Ness.

When I consider the UK I consider only landmasses. So then we go from Rockall in the west to, again, Lowestoft Ness in the east. Since Rockall is so far to the west, the rest of the UK resides mostly in the eastern half.

I wonder where the line is for which half the UK population is north and the other half is south, and the same for east and west. But that's another day's procrastination.

true,Galerath,null,null,"Good question. I think it's a combination of factors, and differs from person to person and company to company.

Certainly part of it is the intensity of the work. Any programmer worth his salt will know what it's like to enter zen-mode and sit there staring at the screen for hours, having the code sort of flow through you as you work out a complex problem. It can be extremely intense and tiring work.

Another part can be boredom. If you're staring at the same system, day after day after day, working on the same sorts of problems, within the same framework, it gets to be mind numbing. You really want to have new challenges thrown at you occasionally as a developer, or it's crushingly boring. Especially for the intellectual types who generally become programmers. 

Management are a serious issue too. Unless your manager used to be a software developer him or herself, they will be completely incompetent to manage you. To them the computer is a magic box and you are a wizard. Except they don't respect you as a wizard, because the Dunning-Kruger effect tells them that they're the team leader therefore they know everything. They don't understand the complexities of the spells you weave, and the phrase ""can't"" will be misinterpreted as ""I don't want to"".

And this leads into another issue, it's also (often) a very high pressure environment. Management very rarely have a good grasp on how long anything in IT takes. They think that because you developed the last thing they asked for in 6 hours you can do the next thing in 6 hours despite the fact it's completely different and requires lots of new code to be written. Then they think you're being lazy if you fail to deliver in the timeframe. So often you'll find yourself having to work insane overtime to meet an arbitrary deadline because you know you've missed too many deadlines recently and management think that they can just replace programmers on a whim (it doesn't work that way).

There's also the creeping feeling of inequality. Being a developer is a high-skill role and it's usually paid less than marketing (""because they make the money"") and management (""because they're the wealth creators""). The reality is the developers do most of the actual *work* in any IT focused company. Most developers really deserve many times their salary, but they're chronically undervalued. Management (particularly Accounting) see the cost of everything and the value of nothing. To them IT is an expense; they don't usually realise it's the bloody cogs of the machine and without it, nothing will get done. 

Finally the buck always stops with the programmer. Always. It doesn't matter if that API was written to cope with the idiotic requests of management, *you wrote it wrong, fix it*; it doesn't matter if that's impossible, *you're the expert, fix it*; it doesn't matter if the language doesn't work that way, *stop making excuses and get it done*; it doesn't matter if the problems are due to the last half dozen hacky work-arounds you put in to appease management, *it's your fault*.

The shift manager at a supermarket governs who is going to be mopping and who is going to be stacking.

The board of executives of a company govern the company's policies, tactics and direction.

The ""[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Observatory_for_Human_Rights)"" group (also based in the UK) handles the international propaganda, feeding us with fabrications of stories from ""the activists"". Note that they never criticise the rebels for their breaches of human rights, the groups title is a lie. They do not issue corrections when any stories are proven false, for example when the rebels bombed the Syrian universities and tried to blame the government just a few months ago.

I agree that this definition has problems, but it doesn't imply that Scotland has no west or east in a UK context. The west is Rockall (or maybe St Kilda, because Rockall isn't internationally recognized as the UK) and the east is the Shetlands. The Scottish mainland as has no west or east in a UK context in the same way that Lanark has no west or east in a Scottish context. It's not west or east, it's in the middle.

This kind of thing is probably why people rarely use directions in a UK context. Much less ambiguous to do it nation by nation. Though, unlike OP, one should specify the nation used.

What did they do? They had a violent protest and burned down government buildings. They murdered several policemen and lunched dozens of black migrant workers. 

The government response was no different from any seen in London during a large protest. Do you not remember seeing the videos last year? Of peaceful protestors being beaten to the ground with battons? The death of someone *who wasn't even involved in the protest*? 

Orwell would be proud of your cognitive dissonance. What do you think would happen if the London riots had targgeted government buildings instead of carpet shops? What if they were killing police and government workers left right and centre? We are already talking of sending in the army long before it get anywhere near that bad. 

&gt; Assad &amp; Gaddaffi 

Why are you lumping these two together? The only commonality is that they sided with Russia during the cold war instead of us. I'm sure this is nothing but a coincidence and that you have researched each of our allies to ensure that Assad &amp; Gaddaffi represent the worst of leadership. Right? 

&gt;  predecessors also committed massacres

Syria yes, which Libyan ones do you speak of? When I search for ""Libya massacre"" all I can see are links about atrocities conducted by the ""rebels"" you so blindly support. Including something I did not see before: the US Ambassador was likely raped by them before he died. Those are some great bed-fellows you have there!

Sure, there is the handling Abu Salim prison riot in 1996, which frankly was no different from any number of riots handled by our American friends in their prison system, see for example the one in New Mexico State Penitentiary in 1980. However, Abu Salim housed terrorist inmates, so perhaps America's handling of prisoners in Abu Grahb and Guantanamo Bay are more relevant? 

I find it difficult to take your arguments seriously when you are so blinked as to what constitutes ""evil"". Nothing Gadaffi has done has come close to the USA. Lockerbie? [See how the experts do things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubana_Flight_455). 


&gt;  had a well established policy of discrimination towards others and favouritism towards his own people

Right, that's it, now I'm just getting angry. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and your views are completely opposite to reality. Gadaffi was secular dictator, he did not favour one ethnic group. He actually stood up for numerous different minority groups whom the Islamists in the east of the country sought to ethnically cleanse. This is why he had so much support from these communities, he was the only thing holding back the terrorist groups. 

Well, they got their wish in the end. With Gaddaffi gone these groups were completely [purged from Libya](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16051349).

&gt;The future of the Web is the future of the world, because everything we do today involves the net and everything we'll do tomorrow will require it. 

There are a lot of things I care about in the world and there are relatively few single issues that I think will affect them all as much and as widely as this. We are in the information age, the control of and accesses to, information will define it. 

A free and open web, copyright and patent reform are all at their core about protecting the deeply remarkable thing that we currently have. An idea, that when you think about it, really shouldn't exist given the nature of the world. If we allow the web to be close and information to become even more controlled and locked down by governments and corporations we giving up one of the single most important advances we as a race have ever seen. 

An open web gives us unparalleled freedom of speech and protects against the manipulation of information. It gives us access to so much knowledge and has a stunning potential to educate and education is key to dispelling hate born of ignorance. It's given us what maybe the most artistically creative period since the renaissance and is changing the face of how we create and interact with art. More music has been recorded in the last 10 years than in the entire history of recoded music and most of that done with out the need or under the control of powerful corporate interests.    

The Pirate Party maybe a single issue part but for me it's *the* issue that I feel is most ignored and misunderstood in mainstream politics and if we don't change that we will go sleep walking in to a world I fundamentally dread. One where all the power for good these technologies represent have been subverted from the public and used to better control us.

Same goes for the kids; I think they are getting enough experience, however it's going to take time for them to adapt to the professional playing level that the likes of Suarez and Gerrard are at.

I don't think the rebels are saints, but frankly their response was justified regarding the response that was given to them when they people started protesting. I'm not going to trawl through hundreds of past links but I followed it all quite closely, and not just Western media, and it was obvious that the government + military was acting out of order in terms of their response. 

Again, you just have to look at other countries which had similar protests but didn't end up in civil war, mostly because their old governments and military forces didn't end up brutalising everyone.

Look, I'm not going to reply further beyond this. In Northern Ireland similar responses will be provoked *long before* the police start suffering fatalities. In Libya it went well beyond that in just the first day. Six dead cops is not a ""protest"", it's an uprising. 

If you think that Libya is ""over the top"" then the UK governments response to unrest in Northern Ireland are completely ""off the chart"" or some other bullshit phrase. 

&gt;  you keep thinking they were justified in essentially bringing about a civil war with their heavy handed tactics

They didn't bring about squat, we did. The east of Libya has had unrest for decades. It was only when we armed the extremists that it extended into civil war. Just two years before this the west was helping Gaddafi round up these very same people as a part of the War on Terror. We renditioned some of the rebel leaders to him. Beghanzi was one of the main sources of the foreign fighters in Iraq. 

Gadaffi's biggest mistake was releasing all of these prisoners in a bid to end the unrest (much like the Good Friday Agreement). But you won't know about that because it doesn't fit the ""evil ruthless man"" story. 

&gt;  frankly their response was justified regarding the response that was given to them when they people started protesting

So, protesters should be allowed to murder and raise fires with no response? What planet do you live on? 

Lets try it shall we? Let's pick an English town far away from London. There were will storm the council offices, drag everyone out then execute them. We will round up all of the black people we can find, lock them in the building then burn them alive. This is tiring so we'll take a rest here. The next day we will storm a MoD depo and execute every person there. We will arm ourselves with the weapons then declare the town to be an independent country.

Good luck! I'm sure the UK government with it's long history of respecting the rights of protesters will do nothing but celebrate our success.

I don't think he's a good option on the wing, but I guess if BR thinks he is he should be. I mean, Suso's not very quick, we don't see him sprinting behind the defence like Coutinho has been doing. His right foot is improving but I don't think he can cross very accurately with it under pressure, so he's a little predictable when on the wing, he always cuts in and never goes on the outside to cross it, if played on the right side. Coutinho can cross with both feet comfortably (like his assist for Downing against Wigan) while being pressured by a defender. Overall I just think he's not the best player to be on the wing.

benefits in reducing noise and intrusion from outside smoking areas in this proposal,

Normally, you need to be referred to a hospital clinic by your own GP.  It's not normal for patients to pitch up to see a consultant without a referral.  If you want to see a consultant, go back to your GP and ask to be referred.

How rural is rural?  If you're in the arse end of nowhere, miles away from any hospital, then it's quite reasonable for your GP to be managing your Crohn's in a primary care setting.  You would get referred if you had a flare up or general deterioration.  However, if your GP is not experienced in managing the disease it might be best to see a consultant or specialist nurse to make sure you're on the right medication.  Asacol is one of the more common drugs used, but there are others.

Go back to your GP and ask if they can contact the local inflammatory bowel disease nurse for you, or at least give you a bit more information.

Example: I was working in IT Support. We had a web based help-desk system that people were supposed to log support requests on. He said that it was important to always have a record of support cases in the same place, and if anyone phones up and hasn't logged a support request in the system (which was usually the case - they don't want to log a call and wait, they want to phone someone and have it fixed NOW), I had to remind them of the need to do so. Fast forward a few weeks, he tells me that users have been complaining about me because I'm always asking them to log the request on the system.

I was quite junior at the time, it was my first 'proper' job, and one of the things he started doing was to make a quiet note about everything I did wrong, rather than letting me know at the time so that I had a chance to correct myself.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Because I feel it's the best way for us to actually be able to have any kind of real self determination in coming century.

But the public's self determination is more and more diluted the less our vote influences how we are governed. The more countries sovereignty is pooled together in some centralised entity the less say each one of us has in our lives. 

I already don't feel like my voice is heard no matter how I vote because of the centralisation of power in this country yet you're saying I'll have more say with more people being represented by less politicians in some other foreign country?

&gt;Do you think any one state in the US would have anywhere near the power of the USA with out the use of a federal system?

What's this obsession with power on a world stage, what has it got us recently? We have more and more people turning to food banks, ever rising energy/living costs, perpetual foreign war expenditure, aid money going to prop up dictators, an ever growing national debt, austerity coming straight from the EU etc...

I'm much more concerned about democratic representation, I'd rather be in a country with less international clout where I personally had more say in how my country is run than vice versa. I'd even question whether we would have more international clout as the british public mixed up in a political union as apposed to standing alone and trading with people.

&gt;I'd much rather our state be influenced by the states around us who have a common cause than from the other side of the world by the USA or China.

Who says the politicians who make up the european union have a common cause with the british people? I don't even believe our own politicians do. Why are the only options to be influenced by europe or by china/America? We could influence ourselves, that's democracy. 

&gt;Do you think that people in the states have less say over their lives than us?

I think they have less say on the federal level as apposed to the state level because there's more weight in your vote the more local the representation. 

&gt;Do you think we'd be better off as a country if we dissolved power as much towards local government as possible?

Absolutely, as much as can be should be devolved as locally as possible. The central government recently shut down an A&amp;E near me despite the fact it was economically viable and both the doctors and public were against in. The more you centralise government the more local peoples views are disregarded despite the fact they're the ones most negatively effected by bad decisions.

You say that your GP is no help, but what do you want help with and gap have you asked your GP for said help?

You say you're getting worse and you're tired all the time. Spoken to the GP about that? What was the response? Talk to your GP about your health concerns.  The tiredness may be due to something else, for example stress - which of course wouldn't show up on your Crohn's blood tests.

What I do have is a specific issue with this new flock of amateur baby-boomer landlords who have gotten hold of the cash to buy up properties (usually through the completion of their own mortgage - or the inheritance of their deceased parents wealth). They know little about being a landlord and their motivation is purely financial as this is seen (rightly or wrongly) as a fairly straightforward, low risk way of getting decent returns with very little day-to-day labour.

People like me, who are under 30 want to buy property... call us selfish, but we'd like to start a family in an enviornment where we can't be turfed out of our home with 4 weeks notice. We also don't really want to pay £150 a month more than we would pay on our own mortgage.

If renting is going to become the norm for a large portion of our society (which, as I said, seems to be inevitable) then there need to be protections put in place that don't currently exist. For example, I find it astonishing that a landlord can get a quick eviction on a tenant that doesn't pay rent and the courts are setup to issue these rapidly. By contrast, ensuring health and safety is largely divulged to local councils who can take up to 6-12 months to take landlords to court to force them to make repairs that endanger the life of their tenants (by which time most contracts have expired!)

[Good Medical Practice: Ending your professional relationship with a patient](http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/relationships_with_patients_ending_relationships.asp)
&gt;
    38. In rare circumstances, the trust between you and a patient may break down, and you may find it necessary to end the professional relationship. For example, this may occur if a patient has been violent to you or a colleague, has stolen from the premises, or has persistently acted inconsiderately or unreasonably. You should not end a relationship with a patient solely because of a complaint the patient has made about you or your team, or because of the resource implications* of the patient’s care or treatment.
    39. Before you end a professional relationship with a patient, you must be satisfied that your decision is fair and does not contravene the guidance in paragraph 7. You must be prepared to justify your decision. You should inform the patient of your decision and your reasons for ending the professional relationship, wherever practical in writing.
    40. You must take steps to ensure that arrangements are made promptly for the continuing care of the patient, and you must pass on the patient’s records without delay.

My take on things:

* we have only heard the patient's side of the story (via twitter no less), we have no idea what he said or his attitude over the phone.

* There is no ""Freedom of speech"" issue here, it's not like he is being arrested, persecuted or otherwise oppressed from sharing his view. The GP surgery have every right to refuse to look after a patient if they feel unable to establish a professional relationship with him (see GMC guidelines above). They've written to him and provided information on where he can find another GP. No doubt they would pass on his medical history to his new GP if/when they ask.

* I personally believe they have done this as a last resort (you need to have good justification and evidence to back it up if this came in front of a regulator).  Did he have a history of abuse to staff previously?

* I also think the man's condition was stable and not life-threatening. This cystic fibrosis issue is a red herring IMO, it's almost impossible to conceive that they would have deregistered him at that point if he was very ill.

* Is this any different to standing outside the surgery and shouting ""*this surgery* is run by a bunch if incompetent twats!"" His tweets did identify the GP practice and the tweets were public. Where does private end and public begin? ",0,1363279256,null,0,false,0,c8vjrkt,t3_1a9wcj,t1_c8vjrkt,t3_1a9wcj,null,1431583937,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Kesuke,null,null,"The idea overall would be to discourage amateurs from letting property, increasing supply on the owner-occupier market. Landlords would need to make their properties more attractive to compete at the current price point. I would imagine under such a system landlords would probably have to make a choice between becoming a serious 'full time' landlord (in order to remain profitable) with a fairly large number of properties... or selling up altogether.

I don't think such a large portion of the rental market should be buy-to-let... there should be a greater portion of co-operatives, housing associations and owner-letters (i.e. with no outstanding debt on the property).

A lot of young people are indignant that someone, who simply by virtue of already owning a property, can obtain finance to buy additional properties. In a sense they are making a dual-yield... because although they are getting a small return on their investment each month, they are also paying down a mortgage which becomes theirs in the long run. So in essence... they are letting out a property they never really owned to begin with (i.e. the bank owned it). So if the bank can own your rental property debt... why can't they own my mortgage debt?

You would think the difference between owning a house and renting one would be the ~£200K it costs... but in reality the difference between the landlord and the tenant is the £20-30K deposit the former was able to raise, and the latter was not.",0,1363279291,null,0,1363279735,0,c8vjs09,t3_1a9xp7,t1_c8vjs09,t1_c8viuuz,null,1431583949,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Because people are less likely to invest in a country banks make less money and offer poorer interest rates on saving accounts, and higher interest rates on loans. 

Basically if people don't want to buy goods from your country, then your currency is worth less. If nobody buys any goods or makes any investments in a country then it's inflation rate will sharply rise as the currency loses value in the global market.

Increasing public spending is a risky option, like cutting straight to the bullet. It could work, and its pretty painless but you could cause so much damage doing it, the patient could easily die of blood loss . 

Austerity is taking the slow route, careful and methodical. It's more likely to work, but it's extremely painful and prolonged for the patient, who may have to suffer for hours. 

The Conservatives have taken the slower, prolonged, painful but fundamentally less risky option. And the country is in pain, and it hates them for it because it hurts. 

The problem with Labour isn't what they decide to do, whether they want to now increase public spending or continue austerity. The problem with them is that the shadow cabinet doesn't look competent enough to do either option well. Ed Milliband and Labour just appear disorganised, weak and with no innovation or creativity. 

It would be like getting another surgeon in just because you don't like the first one because he was causing you pain, but the new surgeon has jittery fingers and could cause far more damage and pain through its incompetence than the first ever caused.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;But the public's self determination is more and more diluted the less our vote influences how we are governed. The more countries sovereignty is pooled together in some centralised entity the less say each one of us has in our lives.

Having a say in your life is only useful if there are choices to be made. 

&gt;What's this obsession with power on a world stage, what has it got us recently? We have more and more people turning to food banks, ever rising energy/living costs, perpetual foreign war expenditure, aid money going to prop up dictators, an ever growing national debt, austerity coming straight from the EU etc...

The above is the obsession, if you don't have power on the world stage you'll have your local stage dictated by those who do. By standing together, pooling resources and working to solve every ones problems instead of just our own we'd vastly strengthen the individual parts of the whole. 

At the moment the power that gives us on a world stage isn't as important as the ability to to direct huge resources coherently but if our problem persist and any number of the issues in the world as a whole get worse we are going to have less and less choice to actually make by our lives.

&gt;I think they have less say on the federal level as apposed to the state level because there's more weight in your vote the more local the representation.

That wasn't the question, do they have less say over their lifes than us? Why is their smaller influence per person at a state leave any different to simply have a single country but with a larger population than ours?

&gt;Absolutely, as much as can be should be devolved as locally as possible.

We have a fundamental difference of opinion here. While I don't think total centralisation is good for any one I also think it's important for a nation to be able to effectively act in it's over all interests rather than be beholden to power held by people with purely local ones.  

&gt; The central government recently shut down an A&amp;E near me despite the fact it was economically viable and both the doctors and public were against in. The more you centralise government the more local peoples views are disregarded despite the fact they're the ones most negatively effected by bad decisions.

That's just an example of bad governance not an argument in terms of local of central government either way.   ",0,1363280535,null,0,false,0,c8vk7i2,t3_1aa11r,t1_c8vk7i2,t1_c8vjhcc,null,1431584137,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What you can do is go to your local council and tell them you're homeless they may have places to put you up temporarily in a B&amp;B, it won't be ideal but in the short term it will put a roof over your head until you can find something more permanent or go to housing solutions (thats what its called in Sheffield in your area in may be called something different) and either get them to mediate on your behalf with your mum to get her to allow you stay or they can find you your own place. 

The council usually have a list of council approved landlords who usually require no deposit or bond and are likely to have empty properties for people like you. They can help you. They can help you get a social or key worker to help you sort out benefits and get grants and put you onto charities and so on to get some furniture and essentials sorted out. 

You won't be living in a palace but at this point you don't have many options. Go to the council offices **now** because its likely they close between 5-6pm and the sooner you go the sooner they can help you. Do not sleep rough. 

As far as benefits go the fact you are 18, single, childless and not disabled (you've not said, so I assume you don't get DLA or anything like that) means you'll get the lowest rate of LHA, don't worry too much about that at the moment. If necessary you can apply for DHP payments to boost your housing benefit and make rent every month. It all seems dark and confusing at the moment because it is but don't worry, it will get better.

&gt; This does not work out.........
&gt;
&gt; At 10 rooms @ £40 per week over a year we get £20,800 in total income.
&gt;
&gt; Even if the £550k for purchasing the houses does include SDLT and acquisition costs it would require interest payments of £22,000 per year at 4%.
&gt;
&gt; And that is no repayment, no allowance for voids and no refurbishment. Effectively this is only working because someone is subsidising the effort which means it is no template for others, after all why not subsidise them down to £10 per week?

If you do the math at 5% 

£275,000.00	Per property

5.00%	Interest rate

£13,750.00	Interest per year

£2,750.00 interest per person per year

£52.88 interest per person per week

To which someone said

&gt; @PraetorianX - presumably the housing association is charging them rather less than 4%. Why does interest of less than 3.5% over base constitute a 'subsidy'?

Ok, here's a thought experiment. Let's suppose we borrow a load of money at 2% because we're the government and that's the 10Y gilt rate and hand it out to buy collectives

The problem is that 2% is because the UK has a low default risk. Once you borrow more it will go up. Look at Greece and Spain for why this is bad. 

You can't borrow money at base rate. Base rate is what the BoE will lend to banks at. If you actually try to get a mortgage it's more like 5%

Also people lend money to profitable things. Collectives by their nature are not profitable. Once you get a sovereign debt crisis they're not cheap either - it's easy to imagine a situation short of a sovereign debt crisis where the government pays more to borrow than the private sector.",0,1363281577,null,0,1363282587,0,c8vkkef,t3_1a7i8c,t1_c8vkkef,t3_1a7i8c,null,1431584304,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,TJP343,null,null,"Yea, couldn't agree more. Sigurdsson has shown some willingness to stay wide but he plays very similar to Iniesta with Barcelona when they put him on the left wing, he vacates the position too willingly. Sometimes Adebayor will drop off onto the left flank but he's not very effective picking up the ball from that position, he should be holding up the play in central positions instead, so it's definitely an issue.

Also, Inter is capable of playing a 3-5-2 and a 4-4-2 plays right into that formation. Three centerbacks to mark two forwards and an ability to counter right through midfield where Inter will have a 3v2 situation almost all the time.

Makes Walker and Naughton have to push up and create width but the problem then is they will leave space in behind for Inter's wide mids and leave space for Cassano to drift into. Cassano's ability to find pockets of space is excellent. This has the potential to create all sorts of issues for Spurs. Unless of course, Spurs just sit back in two narrow banks of four and soak up pressure and look to counter with long balls out to Ade and Defoe like Chelsea in last year's Champions League run.

You really need to go in and be very clear with your GP about what you want from them. Almost every consultation I have seen involves ""well, I've got this..."" and entirely misses out ""I need more information about what's going on"" or ""can you clear things up for me?"" It's very easy for the GP to see you on the list, ask how it's going, how the meds are and the patient will say everything is okay and... that's it. Every one leaves slightly miffed at what that was all about.

So, go back to them. Tell them what's bothering you (information, symptoms, the way they are managing you, whatever) and what you would like to be done about and they will try to bargain with you about what they consider suitable to your case. You would be amazed at how this doesn't occur to some people.

In fact I'm one of them, an open web is vastly more important and given culture and content would still be produced it wouldn't be the end of the world.

true,mrmessiah,null,null,"Hi I have Crohn's. 

2nding what people have said, you definitely do want to get attatched to a consultant as an outpatient because your disease should be tracked through regular blood tests, which the consultant would insist on. Blood tests will also make sure that you're not depleting resources in your blood that you need for your immune system and/or general health. If your GP won't refer you, ask another GP who will. I have encountered a few people (mostly behind front desks or on the end of phones) who aren't particularly well read up on Crohn's who dismiss the severity of it as if it were stomach ache; it's not, and while you don't want to worry unduly you deserve to be taken seriously.

Obviously I'm not a doctor but I have been told Crohn's is one of those things that can present and progress differently for different people. Generally their advice to me has been, if you're on medication that's working for you, stay on it, and if anything changes or you feel like your medication isn't working as it should, go and see someone.

I'm wary of going too far into my own story in case I'm leading you down a blind alley, especially as you mention you had tiredness with glandular fever. But it goes hand in hand with ""needing blood tests"" - I'm on regular Vitamin B12 injections. Why? My Crohns stops me getting vitamin B from food, so I'm deficient, and it needs to be topped up every three months. What are the symptoms of vitamin B deficiency? Amongst other things, tiredness, lack of energy... in my case it actually gives me horrible insomnia and without the injections I can't sleep at night and I'm an energyless zombie in the day. So a blood test would be able to confirm whether this is the case for you too - it is a symptom a lot of Crohn's sufferers get.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think I should be able to help a little - even though I'm Scottish:). I've had Crohn's for over 10 years. I think I got it because of my poor diet and the extreme stress I was under at work and home, but I don't know for sure. I began getting severe stomach cramps, especially at night. My GP told me to eat bananas and bizarrely gave me laxatives. After my weight had plummeted from 12st to 8st, my GP repeatedly refused to refer me so out of desperation I phoned up a private hospital in London and made an appointment with a top gastroenterologist (my work healthcare covered the cost thankfully). Eventually I was put on medication (Asacol and loperamide) which made my life much more bearable.

For a while I became obsessed about diet to try and control the Crohn's but nowadays the only thing I avoid altogether is milk and spicy food. If your Chron's is causing you distress and you want diet tips, I would say drink lots of water. Avoid acidic juices, especially orange juice in the morning and avoid caffeine. Oily fish is a good thing to eat as it's very easy on the digestive system. Avoid big meals late at night. Homemade soup is a good idea if you time to make it, as it's nutritious and puts no stress on your stomach. It might be an idea to avoid bread (as that can cause bloating). You need to work out whether dairy is a problem by adding it/removing it from your diet and seeing how your body reacts. If you are short of energy, maybe start your day with some porridge as that slowly releases energy throughout the day. Eggs are good for protein. Avoid red meat and go for turkey. Fried food is a big no-no and take the skin off your fruit as the skin will likely irritate your stomach.

*Edit: It's important to listen to your body as everyone is different. If something, such as a spicy curry, disagrees with you, your body will let you know.*

Regarding medication, I was on Asacol for about 10 years. Last year it wasn't working at all and everything was going straight through me. I was put on mercaptopurine, which for me has been brilliant. Mercaptopurine is used to treat leukaemia but by accident doctors discovered it can be a great treatment for Crohn's. If you do go on mercaptopurine (which I suggest you enquire about) you need to have  regular blood tests initially to make sure it works fine with your body. I'm lucky to be near a good hospital in the north of Scotland so not sure if mercaptopurine will be an option. Asacol, I believe, is now seen as a rather ineffective treatment, so I don't think you should be on it.

To be competitive in that job market you'd have to be willing to sacrifice your health because of other peoples choices making those jobs more dangerous than they have to be.

You're acting as if it's your birth right to have the equal opportunity for a job regardless of your willingness or capacity to do it or as though employers don't justifiably discriminate against potential employees based on the same reasons. 

If someone has severe asthma and applies to work at a building company despite their inability to do the job the employer will discriminate against that person and choose someone more capable, the state wouldn't ban strenuous jobs because some people couldn't or wouldn't do them based on fears of potential heath repercussions.

If you're not willing at work to come into contact with any smoke at all for fear of long term damage that's not justification to ban everyone from smoking, that just means you should choose a job more suited to you. 

Your right to work somewhere should not take precedence over a publicans right to choose whether his customers can smoke in his own pub. 

Anyway I'm sure those people who are so paranoid about potential health risks of the tiniest amount of second hand smoke would happily walk down a busy road full of exhaust pollution.

The Tories- I trust them to run the economy better than the other two but they seem to be shifting away from the centre and more toward their deeply unpleasant Christian Conservative and Libertarian parts as well as turning their back on the positive view of civil liberties they formerly expressed (ID cards, databases and secret courts).

Lib-Dems- they mean well and are probably closest to what I believe at the moment but they really lack strength and depth once you look past Vince Cable. I support PR reform but see an elected House of Lords as a disaster (I do not support hereditary Lords however). I like their pro-European stance but their inept policy initiatives like the Mansion Tax are just dumb gimmicks, I don't believe in taxing assets.

Labour- socially they represent more of what I want in terms of attacking wealth inequality and a strong social safety net and NHS but I can't get past their very strong record of utter ineptness on the economy and their class-warfare and anti-elitism which always bubble below the surface. They also have a rather limited depth, they are lead by a weak idiot who is too close to too many Brownites. Had they been lead by David Miliband instead then they would have been far more credible as a party I could vote for.

UKIP- I fundamentally disagree with their platform and view most of their policies as a trite set of easy protest statements that appeal to idiots.

Green- their 'green' stance is meaningless to me as they appear to have no regard for science. Their policies are very far left and again have nasty undertones.

It runs a lot deeper than that my friend. He was a constant thorn in our sides, poking and prodding and being a general nuisance. Liverpool was probably our biggest rival in that point in time. A controversial loss in the Champions League and nearly ten + games played against each other in two years, not to mention losing to them in the FA cup, where Benitez was not a gracious winner. We don't like Liverpool and they don't like us. end of. He is the epitomy of liverpool and everything bad that happened around that club regarding OUR CLUB. Football is tribal. Get the fuck over it

Calm down on your caps-lock, it really shows you to be the silly armchair warrior that you are. 

He is not trying to lose games, but he is losing games. Losing games makes me unhappy therefore he makes me unhappy.

And you really don't know anything about Chelsea Football Club or the history if you want to easily discard someone who was of the Vialli era and a true club legend and helped us win a F.A cup then delivered us a champions league and had the team behind him.

That's why I have to sacrifice other things in life so I can afford to go see Chelsea, when I contribute more to the club in a year that you do in ten, I will seriously consider your opinion, hell the other 23,000 season ticket holders might as well. Hopefully you can guide all of us who have been there before the good times onto a quest of moral enlightentment so we are not disillusioned into what are club used to stand for is becoming no more.

Hating Rafa isn't something which a lot of fans can change. Throwing out your beloved hero and replacing him with an ex-rival manager was obviously going to cause problems. Again, you're right in saying that he's only doing his job. This was never the right place to go though and his career here was always destined to fail.

I don't disagree with you on a lot of the Rafa points, but this is just something that we can't change. We just have to wait until the end of the season before we can rejuvenate as the power we were at the beginning of the season. KTBFFH!

However you don't create anticipation because you are setting yourself up for disappointment.

There are those that will say that part of being LFC fan is to dream and at times yes impossible things have happened, but how many will declare the mathematically possible league victory possible?

Let us not embarrass ourself by expecting more than what is fair, we have won 3 games in row, that has not happened in the league for a while, how can we decide we will take our 4th 5th 6th 7th etc. win in row when it's the first time we have strung 3 wins together.

There are midtable teams with better back to back win records in the past seasons than us, I remember Maxi getting us our first 4 goal win by the end of the season to keep our run of 4 goals scored in x seasons in row stat. Then weeks later doing the same. Last season too it was probably Norwich that got us our first 5 goal victory.

How many have we gotten this season? How many games have we scored? 
There was also that video of passing compilation in 08-9 season that would get posted after we stopped playing like that when Rafa left.
There have been many improvements, but these overused, repeated and at this point damaging targets are throwing all of that out.

At the start of the season many hoped while BR put his mark on the team, we would at least keep last years pos. of 8th or get 7th. Not only have we improved greatly in many areas we are targeting better than what the average fan would target at the start of the season.

If we get 6th, this season has been entertaining, included very memorable wins and goals, put the foundation for a playing style quicker than most were expecting at the start of this season.

If we get 5th, we will have one of the london teams below us, which is enough to at least shut up half of the critics using tired ""midtable"" label, the other half will get silenced next year when we have squad to at least beat the top teams. So do not look down on 5th place finish, it's huge achievement at this stage not because of the position, but what it represents.

&gt; For as long as I, Dutch Gordon, can remember Channel 4 has been the biggest sponsor and venue for comedy in the UK.

Except BBC Radio 4 is the biggest commissioner of comedy *in the world*. And that's just R4, not the BBC as a whole.

Since the end of Big Brother and the collapse of Channel 4 Radio, there has been a concerted effort to bring new comedy and drama commissions onto the main channel. As a result, US imports are down (a good move considering the best are cherry-picked from BSkyB's various first-look deals with their studios).

4OD is a pig. It's awful, so is ITV Player and (recently) Iplayer. But they are all catch-up services, and they never purported to be something more. 

&gt;  4OD demands the highest level of copyright protection

Actually, err, no. Channel 4 does not produce it's own content - it's forbidden to do so *by law*. It commissions its programming from the myriad independent production companies in this country. Some are huge (Hat-Trick, Shine Group etc) while others are tiny 3-man bands somewhere out on the moors.

if you don't get it now, you will never understand the beef Chelsea fans have with Rafa/Liverpool. How long have you been watch footy bro? He's booed because he wasn't, isn't and probably never will be (bar winning a cup) welcome @ Stamford Bridge he was considered the LAST person we'd see here at the Bridge, not only for his strong Liverpool connection, but the fact he couldn't fuck up Inter any worse, going from a near perfect, very experienced team who dominated Serie A to what was it, 6th place? He had Sneijder, Maicon, Milito and ETO'O 
  
Fans aren't happy, have every damn right to be vocal about it, and Rafa, the focal point.

So for this club to hire Rodgers and make explicit that here begins a period of rebuilding, we need to temper our expectations and exercise patience. To look at the last two season's finishes (8th place and 52 points and 6th/58) and compare them with this season, we can see there is obvious improvement (taking into account the probability of gaining points in our remaining fixtures, the team's current form, and assuming some catastrophic implosion doesn't occur): With 27 points to play for, all we need is 7 to match last season and 13 to match the season before. This means that *right away* we should be treating this season as a success - not by traditional metrics like silverware, but by much broader measurements that are more important for sustained success. We can see it on the field, we can see it on the league table, and what's more, we can *feel* it.

true,Grumbillz,null,null,"As regards to point 1: I think it is vital for a world class club like Chelsea (who are the current Champions League holder) to have world class players in an all positions. Nobody argues we have world class backs and midfielders and possibly the best goal keeper on the planet. And I mean world class not on reputation, but actual playing form. It is surprising therefore that we do not have a world class striker (on form). Ba is good, but nobody would say he is world class. It is nice that we have world class attacking midfielders who constantly score goals, but to rely on them as the first choice attacking option and not seek out a world class striker doesn't make sense for a club of our size.

As for point 2, I am on much shakier ground, only having been a supporter since Abramovich took over. But I believe that long time fans place club culture as high if not higher than results. There is a 'Chelseaness' that is (or was) an inextricable part of the club, and the appointment of Rafa by itself would have gone completely against that, never mind it was also at the dumping of Di Matteo. It provided unsettling evidence that the owner might pursue any option in the search for results at the cost of this 'Chelseaness', and I think that this is what fans are so vehemently against, and why the anti-Rafa sentiment persists even when we win. This is a negative example. To give you a positive example, would this club culture still exist if say, we bought Ronaldo and Rooney?

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; keeping a diary of every example of poor treatment you receive.

To elaborate a little:

What OP should do is write to his boss and HR department (boss's girlfriend, I see, good luck!) detailing the problems and specifying what the company needs to do to remedy them (e.g. not expect him to work overtime, use a shitty computer that prevents him from working efficiently when colleague has a faster/better one, or whatever).  These should be real, verifiable things that constitute a breach of (employment) contract. 

When (and if) it comes to arbitration, this demonstrates that the employee made his concerns known to the employer (don't forget to keep hard copies of all emails **off-site**) and gave them a chance to address them.  If that doesn't work then he should ask the HR department for details of the company's grievance policy and raise a formal grievance.  If that doesn't work, he should give notice of his resignation stating that the failure of the company to address the issues raised (on date, reference) and in grievance (date, reference, etc) in good time has made his position untenable.

At this point, the company, if they have any sense (or have the sense to take legal advice) will attempt to settle the matter amicably.  Otherwise they're looking at the very real possibility of paying out a huge chunk of money at an industrial tribunal, not to mention legal fees and their own time.  ""Position untenable"" == ""Constructive dismissal"".  However, you must be able to **prove that your employer’s behaviour constituted a breach of (employment) contract**.

A generous settlement would be a month's salary per year of employment, plus whatever your notice period is.  So if you've been there 10 years then you should be looking for close to a year's salary.  But be reasonable and be prepared to settle for less.

If they're treating you bad because you're being shit at your job (pardon the blunt talking) then all bets are off.  Quit the job and go and a find a job that you can be good at.  But if it's the employer being unreasonable that's the cause of the problem then they have a case to answer.",0,1363288756,null,0,false,0,c8vn4b3,t3_1aa06y,t1_c8vn4b3,t1_c8vfgq9,null,1431585507,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I would have thought that the procedure followed once Chrons is diagnosed would be quite similar, your GP may be happy with your condition however (given that asacol seems to be working to control the condition) and is relucant to refer you to a consultant on that basis.  If this is the case though they would certainly want to be taking regular blood tests and for you to report any sort of changes to keep a close eye on things.

It doesn't seem that they're able to provide you with much information or advice however and if you believe your tiredness etc. is as a result of the chrons then they should be looking into that.

It helped to have a relative with CFS who could talk to me about it.

Interestingly what people with CFS usually have is a stressful /demanding situation for some time, then a bug that they never really recover from. Then they have no energy and doing even small tasks leaves then tired for days. They often have digestion problems and can have sleep problems and feel depressed. Obviously these symptoms can be caused by other things, I do not know how they decided you have Chron's. But the 'doing anything too much just saps me for days' is classic chronic fatigue syndrome.

Nope - its the entire point of this thread.

If you want to lobby politicians on an issue, then this particular link to yet another 38degrees spam petition is a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.

This reddit submission is a waste of time. It will have zero effect.

Now... if you want to get change to happen, throw your 38degrees account in the bin, then power up your word processor and type out a letter to your MP and maybe a few peers who you think are appropriate.

Explain why this is a local constituency issue and what your interest in it is. If motivated by a lobbying campaign, be open about that, but summarise the issues as they affect you, and provide links to the full details at the bottom.

I have yet to meet an MP who would object to such a letter.

I have yet to meet an MP who reacts kindly to the sort of clicktivism that the submitted link is advocating.

Seriously, I am trying to help you here.

I don't smoke, I don't want to have to breath in second hand smoke which is *proven* to increase your risk of cancer but just because you want to be able to smoke in a place I may want to get a job which I need to live I should just take it because of *your* rights?

This is like saying that it's ok to leave asbestos laying around the work place as the people who wouldn't want to work there are making a choice base on the risk of illness of the future. It's mind boggling that you think that's reasonable.

&gt;That's a choice then just like they choose to walk down a busy street and inhale the toxic exhaust fumes and just like the scaffolder that chooses to do the job despite risks associated with it.

People take jobs that come with risk but any risk that does not *have* to be part of the job should be removed and those that do are minimised. Working in a smoky bar is a risk that does not have to be part of the job. You also have no choice but to walk down a street and cars are integrale to how our society works. Smoking is not.

Clearly though there are some situations where a tenant can inflict more damage on a property than can be recouped from their deposit. As far as tenants not paying goes, the landlord already has significant legal powers at their disposal to seek a rapid eviction from the courts for tenants that fail to pay.

In many respects - your situation actually demonstrates precisely what I think needs to be stamped out... the amateur landlord who says *""heck, I've got a property, I guess I'll rent it out""* with little knowledge about being a landlord and limited experience to deal with problems when they do arise. For example, a more experienced landlord might realise that allowing a tenant to build up 6 months of arrears is a high-risk stratergy.

I've noticed that wanna-be landlords often seem to be more concerned about the financial/administrative aspects of letting - like *""what will I earn, what will my returns be, how will I pay tax on it (or not), what forms do I need to fill out""* and they care less about *""how will I deal with the tenants, what sort of relationship will we have, what are my professional standards going to be""* etc.

I have recently released the first version of Social Study in the United Kingdom.

Here's how it works:

(1) You register with the site.

(2) You publish your Full Name, Town or City, Postcode and Subject Interests.

(3) You search for people by Town or City who have similar Subject Interests to yourself.

(4) You message each other over email to establish your relationship.

(5) You arrange to hook up in a public place (and then possibly meet up at home afterwards).

If the United Kingdom pilot project is useful to the community I will extend this site to include the United States and Australia.

I would appreciate any suggestions for improving this application.

Warm Regards, Dave Kirkby.

1.) The Cash benefits for qualifying and progressing. Not as much as CL but still need the club to make a profit... and someone needs to pay for Joe Cole's payout.

2.) More to play for in a season. Since we're all sitting around just waiting on the next league match, it's a bit hard. Need my fix.

3.) Tournament to bleed in younger players. Players like N'goo bossing things at Hearts, he could do well getting a run out in games like Europa League. We've got a lot of players on the books who need games to develop, and some players complaining about not getting enough games. Europa League would sort that.

4.) Can attract better players. Yeah we're not going to sign Falcao any time soon, but you'll get better players wanting to play in Europa League than some mid table team. Look at the competition in this years Europa League, there's some tidy match ups. I don't get why so many people say the Europa League is pointless, a trophy is a trophy and I know I'd like to be jet setting off to play football in Italy, Spain or Russia every other Thursday night.

The best effect is a 3D cake, you know, a standing up tardis..not a laying down sheet cake. To do this, figure out the size square you want your cake to be. You can go buy a square cake pan that fits, or just use a regular pan you probably have already, cut a template of a square and cut your cake to fit once its cooled.

Make several cakes and cut them all into the squares. Then, pick your filling (a firm one would be good here, not like jam or something) and basically layer cake and filling until it's as tall as you want. I tend to freeze my cakes before I stack so they wont break apart as easily while Im working with them. It's probably unstable so...you can buy food safe wooden/plastic dowels from like Michaels and you want to stick that through the top all the way down to the bottom. If its still unstable, you can add a few more around the center. 

Next! Do you want fancy or simple? Simple would be: get blue icing and cover the whole thing and get one of the eatable printed pictures of the tardis door and BAM.

For the more complicated: Cover it in icing, then cover it in TARDIS blue fondant (also at michaels.) You can cut strps of fondant for the wooden panel bits...and either pipe the POLICE BOX letters or use letter cutters.

The first 20 mins saw them hustling in defence and coming forward repeatedly with some nice passing. Got clear through on goal once, Cech with a nice save. Chelsea came into the game a bit more after that, their defence keeping us to shots from the periphery, Mikel with three shots, one nicely on target. 

Crowd support sounds like an away game, someone mentioned it might be the placement of the microphones, hope it doesn't sound as one-sided down there. Terry looking up for it as usual.

The goal came at 33 mins, Mata to Ramires who ran through a crowded defence, got a pass back through to Mata who slotted low under the keeper. The goal visibly galvanized the team, with some more attacking play from us. Torres had a crisp shot, but off target. Hazard playing beautifully on the right, with one trademark jinking run back into a centre and sharp high shot which was saved by the keeper. Have to say I prefer Hazard in this wide role. 

In defence, looked a little on edge at the start of the game, more assured later on, Cole shut down multiple runs, outstanding.

Damn. Steaua goal from a corner right at halftime. Scrappy in the box, deflection off Cech, poked in off the rebound.

Overall, momentum swung from Steaua at the start to Chelsea after the goal, then they snuck in an away goal right at the break, we'll need two goals to progress, nothing to say it can't be done, we looked very good in parts, interesting to see if we can open them up if they choose to sit back.",0,1363294703,null,0,false,0,c8vpalg,t3_1aau4s,t1_c8vpalg,t3_1aau4s,null,1431586598,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

Please see my other reply re: dealing with depression in the longer term, request CBT via your doctor. Reliance on drugs is not a happy place to be. I've also seen someone go from depressed to near-suicidal after two weeks on medication he had a bad reaction to, so be aware that if you feel you're getting worse, you might be on the wrong meds.

I accept that the GP did not react in a manner befitting the profession in this specific case (if I were the GP in this situation, I would have wanted to discuss the patient's concerns face-to-face first), but I suppose the point is that in no way should anybody be forced to tolerate abusive behaviour. 

I would imagine that if something legitimately serious happened, the exclusion would be waived, but honestly, I think it's probably better for all concerned if doctors are allowed to refuse to treat a patient if the patient is being abusive; better for the physician because they don't have to put up with that shit at work (in what is already a fairly stressful job), and better for the patient because they will end up with a doctor who doesn't privately resent them. With the best will in the world, I can't help but think that resentment could easily cause a very negative impact on patient care.

Also, remember that GPs aren't paid by the NHS; not directly, at least. they received payment for each service they supply. It's absolutely in the doctor's interest to see as many patients as possible.

It's not a perfect system, I accept, but the message I would take away from this is that it's not okay to be abusive to staff. ",0,1363298014,null,0,false,0,c8vqfur,t3_1a9wcj,t1_c8vqfur,t1_c8vq0a0,null,1431587138,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

* Hazard was brilliant tonight and so was Mata. Thought Oscar looked uncharacteristically tired/uninspired though.
* Mikel and Ramires are surely the best two players to play in that holding midfield role. Very impressed by both of them tonight. Great stuff.
* Terry had a good game as did Luiz. Cole was our best defender tonight but I wasn't particularly impressed by Azpi it has to be said. Felt nervous each time he had the ball and his crossing wasn't particularly good tonight either.

When the Fifth Doctor was dying of poison in *The Caves of Androzani*, it influenced his regeneration: his next persona was that of an arrogant, unstable maniac that healed very slowly. The consensus seems to be that Eight regenerated at the very end of the Time War, after wiping out both the Daleks and the Time Lords. Similarly, whoever it was, suggested that Nine was also a ""defective"" incarnation, who was really influenced by the previous one's cause of death - so to speak.

The theory was that Nine was an incarnation created out of the shell-shock and anger and vengeance of the Time War, who only got better after he met Rose. Nine was bitter and quick to anger; He carried with him a gigantic load of rage that he needed to supress very hard.

What Eleven saw in the room was indeed himself, as Eight, at his darkest moment, right before he regenerated, and what that person was capable of.

Aaannnd.....

&gt;  What I do have is a specific issue with this new flock of amateur baby-boomer landlords who have gotten hold of the cash to buy up properties

That is having an issue with landlords. All landlords have got hold of cash to buy properties that is currently eluding you.

&gt;  People like me, who are under 30 want to buy property... call us selfish, but we'd like to start a family in an enviornment where we can't be turfed out of our home with 4 weeks notice.

You can't legally be turned out with anything less than 2 months notice unless you don't pay your rent.

&gt; We also don't really want to pay £150 a month more than we would pay on our own mortgage.

ROFLMFAO. If you think that you will save loads of money buying a house over renting one £150 a month more then you're an idiot. The repairs that you as a homeowner will have to do which would've been done by the landlord will swallow that up. So far in the 2 years I've owned my current house I've had to replace some french doors at £900, fix the combi-boiler at a cost of £150 (and now have a £200 repair plan), replace kitchen unit doors at a cost of £450, replace an electric shower at a cost of £100 and seal a leaking leaded flat roof at a cost of £500. I've got two double glazed windows where the seal has gone so they'll need changing at a cost of £800. 

Every single one of those repairs would've been done at the expense of the landlord. Those repairs have wiped out over 2 years of saving over renting.

A friend of mine bought a house 18 months ago. He's just had to spend £5k on the roof. 

&gt; For example, I find it astonishing that a landlord can get a quick eviction on a tenant that doesn't pay rent and the courts are setup to issue these rapidly. 

You're fucking joking aren't you? Courts are siding with the tenants if they can pay some of the arrears and promise to keep up to date in the future. It is almost impossible to evict a tenant currently.

It's more than just paying £150 less a month on paper. Its about being able to choose which combi boiler goes in your home... about being able to choose whether to have cheap french doors or delux french doors. Hell, its about being able to put up some shelves or install Sky TV without having to ask for permission. It's also about having the security of knowing, that provided you keep up your mortgage repayments, nothing can move you or your loved ones out of that house... because **it's yours**. You have a vested interest in the sucess of that property... because you **own it**.

As I've said... I respect that these baby boomer landlords have worked hard to be in a position to get their buy-to-let properties... but I don't see that as a justification for forcing an entire generation of youngsters to rent from them - just so these landlords can line their pockets. If you want to make money by investing, f*** off and do it somewhere else, where it isn't interfering with peoples futures.

There need to be fewer rental properties and more owner-occupiers. The easiest way to do that is to clean out the amateur baby boomer landlords with a single buy-to-let property operation from the market. Make it more difficult and costly to let to encourage them to sell up - then allow companies, groups of landlords or professional landlords with dozens of properties to make up the bulk of the rental sector.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"I disagree about Gylfi being a central player; I think he's actually been pretty great on the wing; moreover, I think he's actually really well suited to play there.

Siggy is probably the best natural passer on our team, full stop. Huddlestone is better over long distances, but he either doesn't care to or can't pass over short distances; and while Holtby, Dembele, even Lennon, Jan and a few others are as good or better with short passes, Siggy brings a range of passes that nobody else on the team does. He also is good cutting in on his right foot and shooting, like the sick bender he put on Handanovic today.

And frankly, his crossing is AWESOME. I'm sure he's put in poor crosses/corners this year, but I don't remember them being as frequent as Bale and Walker's crosses are just poor. That crossing ability is mostly wasted down the left.

Moreover, if we continue to play Bale as a second striker/ CAM, then Gylfi's ability to float inside *or* play on the left wing becomes more valuable because he can switch off with Bale.

To be honest, I was talking to my brother about this earlier in the year, but I think the reason we saw so little of Gylfi in the first half of the year is because AVB saw him and said; No, you're too good at crossing to play in the middle of the park. We're converting you into a cut-in left-sided winger who can pound in shots if you're allowed to cut in or drop in pinpoint crosses if they sit off of you. And converting him from being a central/ right-channel player to a left-wing player is why we saw so little of him in the first half of the year. He bring something different off the bench if we want to play Bale/Holtby/Lennon, or allows Bale to play centrally in a Gylfi/Bale/Lennon top 3 midfield.

Also; I think his poor defensive performances in the middle of the park contributed to this. It would not surprise me if next year we come out in a regular 4-3-3, looking like this;

 ----------------Lloris-----------------
 -Walker-Dawson-Vertonghen-BAE-
-----------Sandro-Dembele-----------
------------------Bale------------------
--Lennon-------(striker)------Siggy--


In this scenario, even if we (gods forbid) lose Bale this summer, we can plug Holtby into his spot and keep on trucking. Siggy as wing cover just gives us so many more options; a new dimension coming off the bench, more flexiblity in positioning for Bale, and a budding force on the left wing if (gods forbid) we get an offer for Bale this summer that's too good to turn down.

And to answer your question; if Gylfi is wide cover, we also get Andros back next year, and Alex Pritchard (a youth team player who shows *lots* of promise) projects as a wide player. 

**TLDR;** Gylfi didn't play 1st half of the year because he was being converted into a left winger, and we have him, Andros and possibly some youth players to help us out, so I don't think we need wingers.

So Kyle and Kyle pushed up far, and moussa and siggy pushed too, while scotty and jake (who weren't top today) also went forward at times too, obviously leaving old man Gallas, slow as he is, and superjan, back, alone, against quick players.

I feel as though the formation played a huge part in this. Had we had a CAM like Lewis, to come back and dog their midfield with the help from the ever running moussa and scotty, rather than the worryingly immobile livermore, then we would have seen a different game.

But the trouble was that Scott felt he had to compensate for Jake's failings, hence went back, and Jake is slow and less experienced, hence stayed back, and because of the high line, we gave them too much time to pick that magic pass out, through, around Gallas and onto Brad, who did do well in saving more than his fair amount.

One thing AVB said in pre match above all else is that we can't deny who we are: an attacking team. But I worry we went over the top. 2 strikers. Kyles finding themselves past the wingers. And our midfield pushing up, leaving our CBs open. It was a recipe for disaster, and I think that we should have been more cautious. It has to be said that nobody had the game of their life, and that we seemed arrogant given our lead, rightfully, but we definitely took it for granted, and were too attacking from the off.

Where did I do that? I'm simply point out the facts of what happened. Gaddafi's reaction here was no different to what *any* leader would do in that situation, dictator or democracy. This says nothing about his character, if anything that's my point. 

There is much you can slate him for but this, the justification for the UN resolutions, was all based on lies in our media. This is clear and undeniably proven. 

&gt;  The willingness of protesters to fight against the security forces is not a black mark against them.

NATO jets can do that. The rebels didn't do much but mop up the aftermath. It didn't ""unravel"", the rebellion pushed westwards only with our help. It was ""join us or die"" from the rebels, with rape being used as punishment against families who refused.

My mother had the same ailment and being an only child in a Chinese family I had to act as a translator for her, I would keep a note on how drained you feel as this is systematic of anaemia caused by bleeding, also is a good indication on how badly your bowel is irritated. 

Asacol is the brand name for Mesalasine which is the standard drug for treating and relieving Crohns and Colitis, its an anti inflammatory so should give relieve to stomach cramp associated with Crohns.

Be sure to keep a food diary to keep track of what food you react badly too and therefore to avoid them in the future. 

[This is going to get a little depressing but I seriously don't want anybody else to go through what I went through because I did not bug my family doctor enough]
If it get very bad be prepared to go through surgery involving loosing the bowel and the very real possibility of wearing a stoma for life, this is why it is so essential to keep track of how badly your bowel is irritated as it is the difference between wearing a stoma for a six month whilst your bowel recovers then going through surgery again to have it reattached and a stoma for life. 

As you mention this is a chronic disease and will likely stay with you persistently, what I would recommend is to keep bugging your GP, when I was translating for my mum I had so much faith in our family physician to the point where I believed my mum was a hypochondriac. Long story short I found her nearly passed out from anaemia two years into her Crohns, I called a A&amp;E and would find out that she needed 2 pints of blood and the real kick the teeth for myself was that we had left her condition unchecked for too long and that the disease had progressed past the point where surgery could save her bowel. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.

You claimed that there were no attacks on protesters prior to the establishment of the NTC on the 27th of February.

You also accuse protesters of

&gt;cold-blooded murder, lynching, mass graves, ethnic cleansing and mass rape

Which is an attempt to tar the protesters with the crimes of Washington's henchmen.  Provide a source that shows this happened in February.

&gt;NATO jets can do that. The rebels didn't do much but mop up the aftermath. It didn't ""unravel"", the rebellion pushed westwards only with our help. It was ""join us or die"" from the rebels, with rape being used as punishment against families who refused.

Please re-examine the events of February and early March, where Gaddafi's control unraveled *prior* to the intervention of the Western powers.  His fortunes recovered precisely because the Libyan people were unwilling to back Washington's puppets.

In summary, we have an attempt to blot out the killing of protesters prior to the formation of the NTC, a grotesque lie about the character of the initial protests, and finally an attempt to hold NATO's jets responsible for the collapse in Gaddafi's support *even before the no-fly zone was established*.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; This is a blatant falsification, and we can find reports of state violence at [1] Al Jazeera, [2] RT, and [3] Xinhua.

As proven in other sections of this comment tree, the reports from the rebel groups have been consistently wrong and to be blunt, full of [very deliberate lies from questionable sources](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking). 

All of the deaths in the early days were policemen and government workers. The video you probably saw on the BBC at the time of claimed ""mercenaries"" were black migrant workers on their way to be lynched. 

&gt;  Provide a source that shows this happened in February.

Where did I say it did? The cold-blooded murder and lynching did happen in Febuary and I have already provided sources for these. The rapes came later, ironically following [lies](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html) coming from the rebels about Viagra being personally supplied by Gaddafi to his ""rape squads"".

The rebels had zero credibility from day one. Everything they said was false. The stories in the links you provide are the first publications of these lies. The ""six unarmed protesters shot dead by police on Thursday"" *were* police. There were no ""helicopter gunships"" shooting at unarmed people. The military was not wantonly shelling the cities. 

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have investigated all of their claims. Every one is a lie. Are you to suggest these organisations are taking part in this ""whitewash""? 

&gt; Please re-examine the events of February and early March

Funny, that's primarily what I'm trying to get you to do. Preferably ignoring initial reports that have been subsequently debunked by well respected human rights organisations. 

&gt; where Gaddafi's control unraveled prior to the intervention of the Western powers

It didn't. Gaddafi has *never* had control of this region of the country. Part of the reason Feb 17th was significant in Benghazi was because it was the anniversary of the [2006 Muhammed cartoon protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy#17_February) , which were 1000 [Islamic radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Islamic_Fighting_Group) went ballistic over a drawing, [stormed and burned down the Italian Consulate, killing at least eleven people in the process](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/02/17/libya.cartoons/index.html). Sound familiar? This is *exactly* what it seems they did on Feb 17th 2011. 

Calling these people ""protesters"" is a disgusting insult to everyone who has ever protested peacefully. They are an [Al-Qaeda linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Islamic_Fighting_Group#Relationship_with_al_Qaeda) terror group. Even the American and UK government  recognise this. 


&gt; we have an attempt to blot out the killing of protesters prior to the formation of the NTC

By ""protesters"" you mean the armed rebel groups who had killed at least a dozen people before any of them died? 

&gt;  a grotesque lie about the character of the initial protests

You are the one lying. That you post early reports listing unconfirmed events as ""proof"" only shows how emotionally tied you are to making this intervention morally justified. 

&gt;  If this isn't whitewashing, I don't know what is.

It's establishing facts. Just because Gaddafi was a ruthless dictator it doesn't mean everything bad said about him is automatically true.",0,1363314289,null,0,false,0,c8vvs5z,t3_1aa32u,t1_c8vvs5z,t1_c8vuumd,null,1431589723,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,cb43569,cnty-scotland,Dundee,"That Channel 4 article, which is from two years ago now, doesn't back your position as much as you think. It essentially says ""with North Sea oil, Scotland is in a strong financial position, but oil revenues are volatile"", which doesn't mean much at all. We *know* that oil revenues are volatile, and it doesn't contradict the economic strength of Scotland. The GERS figures are, in fact, extremely promising, because they show that Scotland's deficit is shrinking and that it's smaller than the UK's deficit. That can't be a bad thing. The fact that Scottish Parliament will actually be able to control these additional finances is also important, because it means the ability to invest in growing industries; the power to enact economic policies that benefit Scotland rather than London is an inherent feature of independence, and it's a major one (it's the core tenet of the campaign!).

I've heard some ridiculous assertions, including a popular one (alluded to in the Channel 4 piece) that Scotland would somehow be saddled with the entirety of the RBS debt. RBS is, of course, an institution which operated across the UK, carrying out the majority of its business south of the border. It was regulated by the UK Government, and bailed out by the UK Government. Like the rest of the UK Government's assets and liabilities, the Scottish Government will take a fair share, based on population. Nobody is suggesting that debt associated with banks based in England should not be shared with Scotland - so why is the reverse argument made? It's also a bit of a broken argument to bring up the hypothetical of the banking crisis, because it fails to acknowledge that an independent Scotland could have made many different choices in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, and would, as a small country, have a more responsive economy and one that could quickly recover from any such trouble. There is, too, the precedent of Fortis, a BeNeLux bank which was collectively bailed out by those three countries in which it operated (rather than being bailed out solely by Belgium, where it was based) - a hypothetical RBS crash in the future could see Scotland and the rest of the UK take shared liability like in the case of Fortis, since both parties could lose out from a failure to do so.

The economy of Scotland today, and the economy of an independent Scotland, are large fields, and there are arguments to be made in that department that can't be summed up with a sentence as short and decisive as ""taxes paid by the english pay for the uneployment benefits scotland currently enjoys"". It's not that simple; Scotland's higher *per capita* expenditure is due to Scotland's higher *per capita* GDP. Scotland may spend a larger proportion of its expenditure on certain social policies than the rest of the UK, but there are some things (like pensions) that are [more affordable for Scotland](http://www.yesscotland.net/answers_to_your_questions_on_pensions_and_an_independent_scotland) (see the ""How can we afford pensions?"" section). You're going to need a lot of sources if you want to prove that Scotland's economy is most definitely weaker, or in some way dependent, on England's - and I'm not even sure those sources exist.",0,1363315179,null,0,false,0,c8vw2nq,t3_1a4dhb,t1_c8vw2nq,t1_c8vkdxn,null,1435567411,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I agree with everything you have to say. If you think back to AVB's Porto, he used a 433 where up top there would be two wingers. One of them provided more width, and the other cut in more often. In Porto, this was Varela and Hulk. Here, that could very easily be Lennon and Bale, since Lennon is a stereotypical wide man and Bale cuts in often. Siggy I agree could totally replace either of them in this scenario. Obviously on the right his sublime crossing will be a boon. And since Siggy is right footed, that means on the left he would have a natural proclivity to play as an inside forward, which is ideal for AVB's 433. This assumes that the 4231/442 that we have lined up in is merely transitory as we head towards a 433, something that I hope is the case.

I think we're well served in the midfield, and Brad can stay reserve keeper for as long as he likes.

I'd like to see us go in for Son Heung-Min as I think he could play both striker and out wide. Maybe Jelle Vossen as a striking option to add to our growing Belgian contingent, and or Wilfred Bony as a pure out and out striker.

We've got a few new generation young players who are the new untouchables (Mikel, Mata, potentially Hazard).  Some like Hazard, Cahill, Luiz Ramires are very close to being the new untouchables, once Terry, Lampard, and Cole get the best out of themselves and step aside.  The rest of our players are pretty promising.  Oscar is still a bit weak for me. He's showing glimpses of huge talent, but he needs to mature into the game longer.  Don't' know whether that would be playing him all the time or easing him into the team.  Moses is the same, but needs more game time.  Although he tries hard off the bench.  

Marin to me seems like he won't be legendary for us, but will serve a role similiar to Kalou.  Kind of a dark horse and the fans have taken to him as a sort of mascot kid player.  Ba seems alright.  Think he'll end up being a bit of an Anelka.  Good player and strong, but just not quite good enough.  Semi reliable.  Lukaku looks good. Still think a bit extra premier league, or even German, would do him good for a season or so.  If he wants he could be a huge player for us.  But he seems a bit too eager and needs to be a bit patient.  That might be good though. Bertrand looks alright.  Definitely the weakest of the new generation.  He needs to be watching and working with Cole really closely (Cole was amazing tonight.  Best in the world easily.).  If Torres could play every game like the last 30 minutes tonight, he's definitely good enough as a striker in a partnership or a rotation striker.  But he's let us down every time he's gotten a boost.  Courtouis is a damn good goalkeeper.  A bit of a Cudicini throwback, minus the ridiculously random errors.  KDB sounds ok.  Haven't seen him much but he seems to be a pretty decent player and should hold onto .  

The older guys still I think have another premier league title in them if we can get a decent manager in.

We absolutely played like shit...however, the ref was absolute shit, as well...there is no reason that those two things have to be mutually exclusive...did the ref influence the outcome of the game? yea, probably...would we have faired better if he didn't? no, probably not.

I remember two distinct plays...

1) Dembele got clearly fouled about 5 yards out from the top of the box. Perfect spot for a free kick. However, in an attempt to not dive like most other players, he bounced up quick and tried to get back on the ball. He failed at his attempt, mostly because of how he was challenged and got nothing as a result, because his effort to not dive was seen as no foul taking place. As I said in the match thread, I personally hold shitty reffing more to blame for diving than cheating players.

2) I don't remember exactly when in the game it occured, I believe it was late, but Kyle Walker got absolutely destroyed...I mean, laid the fuck out...he was probably about 10 yards outside the box running parallel to the goal line and an Inter defender missed the ball entirely and took out both of his fucking legs...not only should it have been a foul and a free kick, but it should've been a yellow...What was given? Nothing.

Now again, to re-iterate: I'm not saying these influenced the final scoreline...chances are, we probably don't score from either free-kick, but they were still calls that any ref that didn't require the help of a seeing eye dog would have seen...as I said, shitty team play and shitty officiating are 100% not mutually exclusive...this thread is specifically geared towards the shitty officiating, so that's what's being discussed...if people are going to get their panties in a bunch, go elsewhere.",0,1363317890,null,0,false,0,c8vwxzz,t3_1ablml,t1_c8vwxzz,t3_1ablml,null,1431590296,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

You cannot do that unless you can unequivocally approach each decision the referee made with an objective approach. It's like jury duty man, you would have to recuse yourself given your connection to Spurs. You can call it absurd all you want, but in the end you'll find that you are wrong. I'm not saying you can't judge the ref's decision, by all means your opinion is your opinion, but it ceases to be an opinion when you question the integrity of the ref but also the integrity of the fucking game.

I don't understand how you can say the officiating was biased. It wasnt biased. It wasnt particularly good, for either side, but it certainly wasnt biased. However, the ref did manage to keep all the players safe (unless there have been some injuries that arent being publicized), hell he even brought the stretcher our for Dembele after the elbow to the head. Ref rule #1 (as a licensed ref): keep the players safe, and if a dangerous situation occurs... bring out the medics and punish the guilty party. You don't think the players know this? Of course they do... this the prevalence of HISTRIONICS in modern football.


edit: After reading your username, I can see more clearly your point... or at least an understanding of Foucault. The architecture of a football pitch will never change, so working within that system and the power relationship between the refs and the player, as well as the climate for outside observers to commentate on watching the match (that is to say, those who aren't actively investigating the game and the lives of those involved in order to look for bias/cheating/match-fixing), the logical solution would be the go-pro or glasses cam that was recently attempted at a rugby match. Obviously a microphone would be nice as well, despite the diversity of language... only if we were going for a more critical look at football... but that isnt in the rules.

That being said, and this is probably mostly my fault, there are two levels to what I'm saying. I did not delineate earlier so I will now. The first is that the officiating was horrendous. I do not think it's a good argument to say only an official can judge and therefore my opinion is invalid. Can only striker say Ade and Defoe are playing terribly? It's obvious. And even to my ill trained eyes the officiating was horrendous. Sickgrof below gives some good examples of this. 

The second level is- was the officiating biased. I believe it was- but obviously this is much harder to prove, and I feel like we would go down an never ending road arguing abou this.

What's most important though- and what I believed needs to be discussed is that the officiating was terrible. And it should be looked into. This is the second time against an Italian team that this has happened and it shouldn't happen again. 

Finally, I don't see exactly what your getting at with safety. That's one level yes, but there are many others. Additionally, it wasn't like he went out of the way or was the fulcrum between a safe and not safe game.

To your original points, I refer you to mine: you can say the ref was terrible, hell I thought the ref was terrible, but to question the integrity of the game and ref when you cannot support the point or have the means to instill justice as a 3rd party seeking an investigation (in fact AVB is calling for an investigation into the racism against Ade, which may lead to an investigation into the reffing but that would be a bonus) is poor form. It isnt a good thing, this ref has shown himself to be capable of being awful (see link to being sent a walking stick for the visually impaired), but that doesnt call into question his integrity, thats calls into question UEFA's vetting process.

edit: addressing safety- the number one job of the ref is to insure the safety of the players. 2nd and ALMOST equally as important is the integrity of the game with regards to the rules. The rules are there to insure both safety and fairness... and have evolved accordingly. This isnt like a book on pugilism, each tournament may or may not have a different set of rules.

Jose Mourinho will leave the post of head coach of Madrid ""Real"" this summer. The resignation will take place regardless of what progress reaches the ""Royal Club"" on the end of the season. According to the Spanish AS referring to sports journalist Jose Ramon de la Morena, the Portuguese in January signed a contract with another club.

These Government decisions on vulnerable people will be the difference between dignity and misery and in some cases between living or dying. I'm sensationalising the matter but it is leading us down a road to the loss of democracy and personal freedom.

I should be frustratingly obvious that if you take away a service, those people who need it don't just vanish into thin air, they just reappear elsewhere in the system and this ends up costing far more than if the service was provided in the first place.

Man U at home in the PL, Shaktar, Juve, West Ham, West Brom, Man City away, the list goes on. 

The defensive midfielders are only really effective when there are midfielders in front of him as then he can effectively block the channels. Case and point; Makelele and Essien(when he played that role). When we played with some actual numbers in midfield, they were effective because they were free to intercept the passes with cover from Lamps, Ballack etc. Now there is almost no one for them so teams can easily play a ""1-2"" around them, and overload the wings from the middle with ease. Ashley Cole was getting a fair pounding tonight until Hazard put a shift in. 

Box to box, as they have played pretty much for the last two games, has been far more effective; the defenders have dealt well with the long ball threat/managed to slow the counter down enough that Mikel and Ramires can track back. Mikel and ramires were then allowed to press higher up the pitch and change from defense to attack in the opposition half.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I don't see how a video of some American lobbyist has anything to do with our government.

Why not? If there was a serious attack on the US from Iran whether it was real or faked you can bet that we'd get involved. Just look at how interconnected we are in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya etc. Virtually every significant conflict in recent years where the US has been involved so have we. 

&gt;People aren't that bothered about Syria or Libya because we aren't involved in Syria and Libya was a short conflict that consisted of air strikes.

This is precisely the point i identified, as long as a conflicted is presented in a certain way the public will go along with it. If it's defined as humanitarian and the only people dying are foreign civilians from air strikes as apposed to UK ground troops then no one really cares. 

It doesn't matter if these conflicts still cost us millions and will either lead to more middle eastern conflict in the future or blow-back on our own soil, if it's sold in a palatable way the public won't say shit. 

&gt;You are insane if you think any UK government, Tory, Labour or LibDem could convince the people that becoming directly involved in Syria or even considering an attack on Iran is a good thing.

Again my whole point is our politicians clearly do not need UK ground troops to achieve their objectives so why bother. They could topple people like Gadaffi with the use of the SAS and foreign fighters we arm. Direct involvement to me is not just ground troops, it's things like arming and supplying foreign fighters as well as air strikes. 

&gt;It would take a direct attack on the UK or our Allies to even become involved like we did in Libya.

Where was the direct attack on the UK or our allies that got us involved in Libya? The UK and france are explicitly pushing for more and more military intervention and they would have had it far sooner had Russia and China not blocked their resolutions through the UN. Despite what you say the intention is clearly there and looking ever more likely.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"&gt; as Cory Doctorow so eloquently put it in this response to Tim berners-Lee suggesting DRM hooks need to be HTML5

Ahh, you mean the article where he fundamentally misunderstood the point of the proposal and just jumped feet first into ""OMG! DRM IS SOOO BAD!"" grandstanding circlejerk that comprised his article.

DRM is a reality.  It's not going to go away.  Like it or not, companies that produce consumable media have a right to add or not add a form of protection to try to limit the amount of illegal copying that will take place.  So far, companies have chosen largely to add it.  I'm not defending their decision, or even claiming it works.  I'm simply pointing out the facts as they stand.  And there's no sign that their position is going to change to any great degree.

You either have inter-operable standards that are supported by everyone, and are capable to supporting a broad range of functionality that organizations need, or you drive people off to use proprietary, closed, non-standard systems that STILL mean we get DRM, but result in a broken ecosystem where depending on your OS/Software setup it may work for you or it may not.  People often claim that DRM is broken because it punishes the legitimate customer by making it harder for them to be able to use the game they downloaded, or play the video they bought on iTunes on other devices, whereas all the issues are removed for pirated/cracked software.  This spec proposal is designed to reduce this problem.  To provide an open standard platform that reduces the need for proprietary DRM that causes so many people so many headaches and limits your ability to use media that you paid for.

By supporting DRM hooks in the HTML spec, TBL is actually *living in the real world*, rather than some ridiculous cloudcuckooland where if we wish hard enough and click the heels of our ruby slipper together, DRM might suddenly vanish from existence.  It may be an evil.  But it's a necessary evil, because the net result is to make technology and people's ability to use it without problems marginally better, rather than the less desirable alternative.

When you're faced with two shite alternatives, one of which is marginally less shite than the other one, it's probably better to go for the less shite one.

I say a pub owners right to decide whether people smoke in his own pub takes precedence over your right to work in a smoke free environment when you're perfect capable of working somewhere else. Because we have free choice no one is forced into situations they don't want to be in. 

In my world the worst case scenario for you would be smoking and non smoking pubs where everyone is accommodated, in your world everyone's ability to smoke is restricted based on a certain percentage of the populations imagined birthright that they should be able to work wherever they like regardless of how many are negatively effected.  

&gt;You also have no choice but to walk down a street and cars are integrale to how our society works.

My whole point there was to expose the insanity of people caring so much about one potential health risk and not about another. If they were actually consistent they would wear some kind of mask walking down busy streets or take the scenic route everyone but that doesn't happen because the public have been conditioned through fear mongering to think a certain way. 

In reality the risk of working in a bar with a smoking room that you venture into for mere minutes every day is blatantly negligible but you're acting as if it's some kind of immense health concern that justifies no one being allowed to smoke at all. I basically reject the premise of your whole argument and find it fundamentally selfish, for me an employee could choose to work someone else but for you the smoker has no choice to smoke in pubs/clubs anywhere.

That's the arrogance I'm talking about. Who are you to decide who is and who is not a fan? I think that someone who's either liked a show for 8 years, consumed 8 years worth of it, or falls somewhere in between is certainly a fan. Most people have enough backstory to know the important events that happened before 2005 (such as the fact that there were 8 doctors already)... a lot of people have at least seen a Youtube video or something explaining what past regenerations were like. But even if they haven't, just by watching the new series you would learn about The Time War, The Master, K-9, Sarah Jane Smith, and the back story of the Daleks. It's not like starting at 2005 makes you oblivious to everything before that, and I'd be willing to bet that most people who consider themselves fans (at least, people that would read this subreddit) know a little of that back story.

I'm not saying that watching Classic Who doesn't make you a more knowledgeable, possibly even a greater fan. But I don't think it's your place to say that those who come in at NuWho shouldn't call themselves fans. *That's* an arrogant attitude.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It isn't *necessarily* wrong or antisemitic to blame a Jewish conspiracy, since conspiracies can and do happen. 

The first question we should ask is whether Jews really do own British media. Fortunately this information is all publicly available. For TV, here's a list of the CEOs or directors. Whether they were Jewish or not was determined from Wikipedia biographies and googling ""X Jewish"", ignoring disreputable or conspiracy site links.

    BBC - Tim Davie - Not Jewish
    ITV - Adam Crozier - Not Jewish
    Channel 4 - David Abraham - Jewish
    Channel 5 - Richard Desmond - Jewish
    BSB - Jeremy Darroch - Not Jewish
    UKTV - Darren Childs - Not Jewish

It's worth noting a lot of British TV executives listed in Wikipedia have obviously Jewish names. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:British_television_executives

And for newspapers,

    Sun, Times, BSkyB, ITV - Rupert Murdoch - Not Jewish
    Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, Metro, ITN - Jonathan Harmsworth - Not Jewish
    OK, Ch5, Express, Star - Richard Desmond - Jewish
    Standard, Independent - Alexander Lebedev - Jewish

So it seems while there's a surprisingly large number of Jews owning media and TV companies, considering Jews are less than 0.5% of the UK, you'd be grossly in error if you said Jews own the media. They own about *half* of it, and this doesn't explain why the other half would be in on any such conspiracy.",1,1363334330,null,0,false,0,c8w0spj,t3_1abpay,t1_c8w0spj,t3_1abpay,null,1431592091,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The problem with CFS is that there is no test for it, doctors simply say you have CFS if there is no other illness that you could have.

If you are always tired and Chron's does not explain that then CFS is not that unlikely as far as I know. 

Most people with CFS seem to spend months or years before getting a diagnosis, as 'feeling tired' is a rather unhelpful symptom that could be a sign of 50 other diseases. However, if your blood tests are all normal and you are knackered for days after going for a 30 minute walk then they are clearly missing something important.

Depression is also really common with people with CFS due to poor understanding of the disease, limited treatment, limited chances of recovery and because we lose our 'normal' life and have to stay in all of the time. At least the internet now exists, so you can talk, work, and study online, which I now do. (I am studying for a degree online through UoL).

I couldn't find any actual information on what they fund or where it winds up, but I think this post is intentionally nitpicking to ignore the spirit of the article? The BBC never really set the comedy ""zeitgeist"" as the author says (this is subjective but it's not an impassioned article, it's an editorial aimed at people in their mid to late 20's who grew up with the Channel 4 comedy lineup)

4OD demands the highest copy protection - I don't know what your response to this point is. I don't think you ""get"" what's being said here. Unlike other video players, you can rarely successfully pause 4OD without the stream flat out breaking thanks to the copy protection. It's what makes the player such a pain to use. This has little to do with who's actually at fault and more a shorthand to address the problem. Even so, citing ITV player etc doesn't really address the issue, 4OD isn't competing in the high walled garden of TV, it's competing with every single video on the internet. Furthermore, YouTube does commission content from true indies, and they don't implement arcane, crippling copy protection in these videos.

As a last point, there seems to be (sadly) some pervading myth in the UK that being on TV = success. I suppose we're all so dazzled by the institution that is the BBC to actually consider things objectively. In the US there's a much greater understanding and adoption of independent, online content, and the UK is falling behind HARD as a result of our backwards fascination with the authority of television. Look at the ratings for any of C4's new shows. Peep Show's highest rated episode was watched by only 1.8m as it broadcast. The series was nearly cancelled, time and time again. Getting on television isn't the golden ticket that so many of our young creative types seem to think it is, and desire to sell out and get syndicated is hurting our creative output. For every brilliant, British, independent show like ""The Art of Awkward Conversation"" there are 10 equally amazing series being put out by similarly small, independent global production houses.

That's a drop of nearly 10000 supporters in three weeks. The Sparta game had an attendance of 38000 which was the first time I had seen it drop below 40000.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;Our fundamental disagreement is on what takes priority over what. I say a pub owners right to decide whether people smoke in his own pub takes precedence over your right to work in a smoke free environment when you're perfect capable of working somewhere else. Because we have free choice no one is forced into situations they don't want to be in.

You assign a higher priority to what someone wants rather than what some one may need and you do so while claiming that you are trying to be fair.

&gt;In my world the worst case scenario for you would be smoking and non smoking pubs where everyone is accommodated, in your world everyone's ability to smoke is restricted based on a certain percentage of the populations imagined birthright that they should be able to work wherever they like regardless of how many are negatively effected.

Again you are claiming that some one want to damage them self's in a way that can damage those around them should be of a higher right than some one having to face a choice of feeling like they have to take a job that comes with a risk of damaging their health that does not have to be there.

&gt;My whole point there was to expose the insanity of people caring so much about one potential health risk and not about another. If they were actually consistent they would wear some kind of mask walking down busy streets or take the scenic route everyone but that doesn't happen because the public have been conditioned through fear mongering to think a certain way.

Working day in and day out in second hand smoke has been proven to increase your risk of cancer. If you live in a city you are exposed to a given level of pollution regardless of what you do. Just because you are already exposed to that risk is not a reason to seek to limit risks else where. It's like saying that since you may die in a car crash simply by driving the car you shouldn't bother wearing a seat belt.

&gt;In reality the risk of working in a bar with a smoking room that you venture into for mere minutes every day is blatantly negligible but you're acting as if it's some kind of immense health concern that justifies no one being allowed to smoke at all.

Except above you just said that you see smoking and none smoking pubs as a possible outcome of this which is not ""mere minutes a day"". I'm acting like I am because that is what the policy opens the door to and that this is the reason the ban exists as it does. UKIP and your self are couching the removal of the policy and all the reasons that policy was put in to place with an argument you seemingly can't keep logicically consistent for getting a toe in the door.

&gt; I basically reject the premise of your whole argument and find it fundamentally selfish, for me an employee could choose to work someone else but for you the smoker has no choice to smoke in pubs/clubs anywhere.

Again I find this remarkable, you are saying that some ones right not to have to simply go outside to smoke because the smoke they produce is poison in a very literal sense trumps peoples right not to expose them self to a risk that is not an inherent part of the job.

That you think anyone would turn down a job to work in a smoke filled room in this economy is a joke. People have to take the work they can get (if some one on JSA was offered a job in a bar they wouldn't be able to say no to it) and you want to equate that ""choice"" to the choice people have to smoke when those people can still smoke just outside the damn door and you have the * gaul* to call me selfish?

And what does Radio 4 have to do with comedy TV? (Deep breath now)  *The Day Today, Little Britain, Chambers, Armstrong &amp; Miller, The Mighty Boosh, The Mark Steel Lectures, Absolute Power, H2G2, Dead Ringers, Goodness Gracious Me, Knowing Me Knowing You, 15 Storeys High, The League of Gentlemen, That Mitchell &amp; Webb Look* (BBC) and *Whose Line Is It Anyway?* (CH4), all began life on Radio 4, with *Just A Minute* being televised for both ITV and the BBC. Radio development is cheaper, and a very large wedge of those working in comedy broadcast have come up through Radio 4. The BBC has **always** set the comedy zeitgeist and CH4 has always sought to bounce off it.

4OD does have terrible streaming, it's true. But as I said, they're unique in that they are banned from producing or owning any of their content themselves. The BBC, BSkyB, ITV can all to some degree dictate the terms of their platforms as they still commission a majority of their productions in-house.

And yes, I know youtube is commissioning from indies such as Hat Trick. But their total annual spend is only £10 million, versus the £450 million at CH4 (£1bn at ITV, £1.75bn at BSkyB, £2.5bn at the BBC.) Production for the internet accounts for only 2% of the revenues of these indie companies - that's simply not enough to sustain them. Google doesn't care about the film/tv industry. They made that very clear in the US. It's not worth the indies' time or effort to argue right now, just pocket the beer money. There's a while to go yet.

Any doctor could also get struck off the register if they refused to treat someone in an emergency for personal reasons. 

I'm not sure you absolutely understand the implications of negative personal feeling in these sort of cases. Say you're a cardiologist and a patient you personally despise because of a prior falling out (with a known history of being a hypochondriac) comes in complaining of pain in the chest, and you have to determine if they've got angina or not. If the doctor has strong negative emotions towards the patient, they may err on the wrong side and potentially put the patient in a dangerous position. If a doctor is in circumstances which may negatively affect their ability to care for the patient, it is their duty to refuse.

Besides, just to get around this sort of thing, all GP services are available at hospital clinics, and in case even that is impossible, the NHS-run ambulance services have groups of GPs in cars who are available for 24/7 callout for minor cases.

Straightforward violence on the other hand, had enormous amounts of leeway, from conditional discharges to years in prison. Now, given the enormous ways crimes of violence can vary, this is justifiably unavoidable, but it can lead to some incomprehensible sentencing.

Personally I think the priority in regarding crimes of violence as less blameworthy than those for personal gain to be backward. Frankly violent crimes are really the only ones I actually care much about.

Edit: There also seems to be an issue, in that judges cannot *generally* impose both community sentences and custodial sentences. There is thus a perverse incentive to avoid jailing the convicted so as to be able to issue more involved community sentences. This is what happened here.

Community sentences have great potential, far more so than prison, and need to be used. However as long as there is a punitive and deterrent aspect to the system it needs to be applied fairly. A need for a lengthy and involved rehabilitation sentence in order to be considered safe shouldn't be a means to avoid a punitive measure that would be recieved by a less dangerous person.

Saddam Hussein's opponents did pretty well, taking 14 out of 18 provinces. Then the US and UK changed their minds and hung the rebels out to dry. 

This helped Saddam Hussein consolidate his power as he now knew who some of his opponents were. He released video showing what happened to them, and it wasn't pretty.
