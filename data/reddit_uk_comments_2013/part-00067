I agree, the tough decision is to motivate people to get into work - differentiate between the people who have actually fallen on hard times and the peoples who are simply abusing the system. However, I think simply reducing the safety net for people would leave a lot of hardship.

Perhaps hardship is what the British people need though. We do see a lot of other countries working really hard to innovate and produce. As a separate issue which gets on my tits - people often think that the UK competes as a service providing nation, and other countries like China and India only have growing economies by serving as cheap labour. This is absolutely false. These countries are innovating massively, ideas and creativity are flowing out of this places! They provide creative services - not just sweatshop work. 

Perhaps we do need hardship for people to realise that the competition from other countries for economic power is incredibly stiff. We can't provide a good welfare state if the economy isn't growing.

Here is a taster for the lazy:

Myth: There are hundreds of families where grandparent, father and son have never worked.

Fact: Studies recently concluded by Teesside University of 300 families in the poorest areas of Middlesbrough and Glasgow found only one family that had had three generations of unemployed.

Myth: Large numbers of people have been unemployed for years – the shirkers.

Fact: From the Department of Work and Pensions own statistics there are currently around 1.3 million individuals on employment support allowance (ESA). Of those, less than 1 per cent has been unemployed for 10 years or more.

Myth: Benefit fraud is at epidemic levels and is a huge burden on the taxpayer.

Fact: The level of benefit fraud is about £1bn a year, just 0.7 per cent of the overall social security budget. Meanwhile, the HMRC estimate of tax evasion in the UK amounts to £40bn.

So when these councils, run by men, come across cases they likely act in a patriarchal mindset.

Good on the bbc for covering this.

That sounds like a line that suits British society down to a tea. British society in the 1950's probably.

&gt;Sharia courts are not allowed to interfere in child access matters, but when Sonia went to Leyton Islamic Sharia Council for a Sharia divorce, they told her she would have to give the children up to her husband.

That sounds fucking disgusting, extremely dangerous and has zero place in the uk.

That's what strikes me the most about this sort of thing.  People are quick to say they could survive on that much money and then list off a whole load of expected costs. 

But they're not the costs that screw you over.  Budgeting for £53 worth of food and transport costs is easy.  You might not be planning to live well, but you can certainly plan to live. 

But replacing your fridge, or your TV, or having to get new glasses can wipe you out.  Or maybe you break your leg, and need to make entirely different, far more expensive travel arrangements.  

And that's not even going into the way that being poor keeps you poor.  Does that £53 a week include your clothes for an interview?  Well, maybe you had them already - But what happens if you damage them?  Often, what happens is that you lose the job to someone who's seen as more careful about his appearance, or less shabby.  Which in this context means someone with more cash, who's not had to learn to sew on his own suit.   

Or what happens if you've got an interview in a nearby city.  Since you'll usually not have all that much warning, you're left with short-term planning and that's easily your £53 gone right there.  

There's just so many one-off, vital expenses that the relatively well off just don't notice.  I've been lucky - my girlfriend's had family resources to rely on while she looked for a job, but there are so many opportunities that she wouldn't have been able to even consider, if she didn't have her parents willing to cover her train costs for interviews, or help her out with her interview clothes.  But even so, we spent 4 months without a TV (which admittedly, isn't a big deal for us, but was still irritating) and I'm spending far more money than I should replacing bits from my computer with second-hand parts as they wear out.  Sure, my monitor may have been less than half the price of a new one, but it'll last a quarter of the time, at best.  Hopefully, by the time it goes, I'll be in a position to actually buy a decent one.

Martha and 10 clearly cared for each other, but between the loss of Rose and just incompatibility, he didn't feel the same way for her.

Donna was more of a platonic love--like a best friend or brother for 10.

Amy loved Rory the most in the end, but saw 11 as this far more interesting and mysterious individual, but 11 helped her see that what she felt for Rory was ultimately stronger.

Now there's Clara and 11...and right now I don't really see an epic romance in the making.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"No I understand exactly what you mean.

The Romans used the term to refer to the ancient practise of killing one in every ten men upon reasserting their control after a rebellion or uprising. So some city would say ""To hell with you we're independent now and we're not paying you taxes any more"" and then the Romans would march a legion in, retake the city, and execute 10% of all the adult males to remind the people that the cost for disloyalty would be severe.

Of course doing such a thing in the modern day would be an excellent way to find yourself being charged with war-crimes and in a whole lot of very hot shit very fast, and the meaning over the last 300 or so years has morphed into just referring to severe destruction (which of course, is quite different than a 10% extermination rate). Decimate has virtually become a synonym for annihilate, for better or worse.

People just get uppity about it because decimate comes from decimare, the ""deci"" being the clue that we're talking about 10's, from decem (as in, decimal - ""of tenths). So from an etymological perspective it does mean to kill one in ten (well, ""ten-kill"" would seem like an excessively literal etymological interpretation, but whatev's).

That's one of the things I think is really cool about etymology, once you start to understand where the roots of our language come from, you can start to figure out what words mean without being told, just from how they're constructed - and you can also sometimes see that a word has changed from its original meaning just by realising that the modern meaning of the word that you're already familiar with doesn't accord with its etymology.",0,1365366452,null,0,1365366670,0,c9aetc5,t3_1bpqmf,t1_c9aetc5,t1_c9aejs1,null,1431640490,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt; Nobody cares.

As much as I condemn the poor application of your opinion, I believe you're right. Nobody does care, and I think that's a major problem. People have become so desensitized to issues like benefits, primarily from the media, that it's almost become publicly acceptable in some circles to claim, falsely, that benefits claimants are undeserving. If they're not apathetic, they tend to be virulently against it, having dehumanized welfare claimants.

I know a personal friend who's physically disabled, and yet is also a huge anti-benefits proponent. It's quite ironic, actually; and definitely hypocritical. She'll go on (arguably incorrectly) in huge rants and tirades about how every benefit-claimer is a lazy, good-for-nothing so-and-so, blaming immigrants to no end; and, yet, when it comes to her own benefits being reduced she'll act (arguably rightly) as if a great injustice has been done towards her, that the government is targeting her and that benefits need to be increased. ""Increased"" regarding herself, not everyone else though. As she still sees everyone else on benefits as ""welfare-scrounging scum"", because that's what the media claims, in spite of actual evidence.

The media feeds people what they want to hear (that the people taking our money, instead of actually needing it to survive, are wasting it - because that justifies us being able to keep our own money), and no-one cares to think differently or challenge it, because for many that would be in stark contrast to what they believe (confirmation bias).

Besides, we have a very good tendency of seeing facts and figures that disagree with what we say and going ""Who says that? I bet they're not a reliable source!

Companion Clara's only been in the previous, where let's be honest, she didn't do a whole lot.

true,barristonsmellme,eng-merseyside,Liverpool,"You're probably best looking at the TL;DR, i'm a bit shit.

Tins of tomatoes are 31p in tesco, buy 3 of those, a bag of small potatoes and a bag of onions. That's £2.93. Mushrooms for a quid too, and peppers are usually 1-2 quid but they're an extra so add them if you want, i usually skip em.

bag of tescos plain flour is 45p and tesco mixed range eggs are 1.40ish too. so that's just under a fiver. 

200g of flour and 2 eggs will make dough for spaghetti (takes about 5-10 minutes to make into a suitable dough, chill it for about 20-30 minutes if you fancy, only takes 3 minutes to cook in boiling water though).

Nice tomato sauce for it is just tinned tomatoes and a few dried herbs (If you have a foreign food shop/market you can get big bags for next to nothing. cost me about £5 to buy in a bulk stash of herbs/spices for food and curries). 

As you can tell i'm really shit at formatting these things, but basically, make the spaghetti by rolling it out and cutting it thin (there's a billion and one vids on youtube showing how). chill it in the fridge.

Fry up some diced onions and garlic (also cheap in foreign shops, 4 whole...garlics... costs me 90p when they do it by weight) add in your mushrooms/peppers if you bought any, and your tinned tomatoes and just let it cook off for a bit.

Best part is, if you fancy a curry, use rice instead of spaghetti, and add a teaspoon of any spices you can pick up cheap. add some fried mince and you've got yourself bolognase.

**TL;DR** Tomatoes/onions are stupidly versatile and are the base for a billion dishes. Potatoes can substitute meat if you don't fancy looking for cheaper stuff. 

Any spices should always be bought in spice shops/markets. 1 small tub of turmeric in tesco is £1.90. A big bag is £2 in these shops. It will last you a good month or 2 aswell. Longer if you don't live off curries (Ilovecurries.)

EDIT; (easy pasta)[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lMmUf2nqYA] If you don't have a blender, a bowl and your finger will do. If you don't have a roller (because lets be honest, how many people actually can be arsed paying for one?) just roll it out really thin. It takes a few minutes longer but not that much at all.

I don't know any specifics, but I'd suspect he'd continue to act in the course of ""greater good"" as ever, but his morality would dip lower and lower due to a natural tendency towards darkness and the absence of his forgotten rules (""Good men do not need rules. Today is not the day to learn why I have so many."").

Also, we have to approach the Valeyard at some point. I wrote something of a poem in the thread ""If you ran doctor who?"" (not sure of the title) explaining in a little more detail how we might go about it.

The series does need a bit of a kick to it, perhaps even a full season or two of darkness winding down (up?) through the Doctor's loss of self/transition to-and-or-from Valeyard. This loss of self would also explain why he would testify against himself in court. He (as Valeyard) doesn't realize that he's truly the Doctor (unless he expressly acknowledged it himself in that episode?), and so would gladly (as Valeyard) stand against a rogue and self-idolizing Time Lord wreaking havoc across time and space. Perhaps at this point he could (as Valeyard) realize who the Doctor is, who he is? As a late incarnation, the incarnations prior to (6? I think? Whoever was on trial) wouldn't know him, so action against him by early Doctors could perhaps play a plot point in a metacrisis episode, and all would discover the truth together. Could also have other Doctors post-trial simply not recall his face fully and every incarnation remembers together. This could culminate in a super-Christmas-y Christmas special in which either

1) all is restored

2) all is lost and we hiatus again

3) regeneration

4)???

true,AbruptCuts,null,null,"I know a lot of people are not liking this episode, but I think in terms of setting up themes for the overarching story arc it was just fine. 

Hear me out: First off, you had last weeks episode which was all about the Great Intelligence feeding off of people's memories - I'm not too certain but I think one of the characters actually mentioned it was the people's ""souls"" that had been uploaded to the cloud. I feel it's important to remember this and it will become apparent later on why.
In The Rings of Akhaten you have the ""old god"" being offered a sacrifice of memories and stories in order to remain asleep, a sacrifice in the form of Merry, the Queen of Years - a repository of the collected history and memories of her people. Again, it's an entity that feeds off the ""souls"" of others.
I believe the Doctor has become obsessed with the concept of a ""soul"" both the religious context of it and possibly a scientific one. I'm fairly certain the Doctor is an atheist at this point, so this season may very well be a test of his ""faith"" in science and knowledge. His great speech to Akhaten about all of the memories and knowledge he's collected over the years is a testament to how much faith he puts in what he knows - he might very well believe that his brain can overload this old god, but as we saw in the episode it was actually Clara's leaf - the promise of what is UNKNOWN that is able to do the trick.

Now, as a further setup to the Doctor's obsession with Clara, we have the little Sagan inspired speech he gave to the Queen of Years about being unique and how we're the conglomeration of ""star stuff,"" yet Clara, who he KNOWS is not unique and has appeared in more then one incarnation over the years, is standing right next to him at the time. Has he stated that she is ""not possible"" mainly because she flies in the face of everything he knows about the universe? That there is something immutable and immortal that exists within a living entity - aka. a soul?

I think this would be an interesting route to take the Doctor's story. He is an immortal (or at least long lived) being who is surrounded by death (most recently his best friends Amy and Rory) and he has come to accept the finality of death in his thousand years of life. Yet here is Clara who is a complete counterpoint to what he's seen. In the Bells of Saint John we see him in a MONASTERY, a building associated with religion. Here in Akhaten we have him taking Clara to what is essentially a type of Mecca for what seems to be a galactic (or at least interstellar) religion.

The Doctor has fought and debunked many would-be ""gods"" in the past;  I believe the show is at it's best when the Doctor's foundation of knowledge gets shaken to the point where he begins to doubt himself - case in point: The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit. It's possible this series may follow a similar note. So, while the episode DID have it's issues, I think it was very much typical of Moffat-era Who - it has some nice character moments, great practical effects (the creature effects in the marketplace were superb!), what I thought were genuinely emotional moments punctuated by brilliant performances, and the Doctor involved in an almost metaphysical mystery that will span the remainder of the series.",0,1365368674,null,0,false,0,c9afjmh,t3_1bt1fd,t1_c9afjmh,t3_1bt1fd,null,1431640146,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

2. What's your justification for defining 'years' as 1 or 2 rather than 10? Only your own definition. Therefore I don't accept your dismissal of ten years as a 'completely arbitrary number'.
3. I think you give far more credit to the intelligence of benefit fraudsters in their ability to avoid detection than is warranted. Even if there are a few criminal masterminds who manage to go undetected this will be a minority of people and therefore will not cost the taxpayer an enormous sum. Even if we were to just take your assumption about fraud, surely there would also be large amounts of undetected tax evasion? 

Of course it's always important to critique research regardless of whether you agree with its conclusions. But I don't think you're warranted in dismissing it in such strong terms given that your points themselves are based on no evidence and your own unjustified definitions.

I wouldn't try to deny that benefit fraud does exist and will be at least slightly higher than the official figures suggest. Ideally we could get welfare completely right where all those who need it get it while there is nobody taking advantage of the system. For me I would rather a system where all those who need the support receive it while a few take advantage than a system where almost none take advantage but there are needy people who are unsupported.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; can you explain to me how punishing people on benefits makes your money worth more in the world?

Absolutely; several ways...

* It is an incentive for people out of work to leave areas like London, freeing up living space for those who may take jobs (which though in short supply, are actually in fairly good shape in London compared to other parts of the UK).

* It's an incentive for people on benefits to find work, reducing dependence on the state and freeing up tax money for other projects that benefit tax payers.

* Perhaps, and this is the hardest part, it's just a darker side of human nature that you want to see someone who doesn't work and is dependent on your tax money to enjoy the same hardships you percieve in your own life. Controversial - doesn't float my boat but I suspect it appeals to many.

&gt; Are you aware of the circumstances you have to be in to get anywhere near the £26K level?

Yes I do appreciate this is a rarity and not the standard - I was making the case that even as a rarity, it's very generous.

true,AtomikRadio,k9,K-9,"Edited version since the modbot got me for the N-word.

Words are one of the main ways we convey thoughts, feelings, and ideas. When you have a thought or feeling you want to convey you choose the words to express that and you speak or write those words.

A person who wants to say something will take their vast vocabulary and choose the words that best describe what he's trying to convey. If someone is trying to tell a story about a time they got ripped off at a car dealership and they need a word for ripped off they mentally go to their little word cabinet and see ripped off, screwed, gypped, fucked over, defrauded, and others. They will say whatever word they choose at that time.

The n-word is probably the most widely known/used racial slur. Everyone knows it has racial connotations. At this point it is virtually impossible to separate it from the racial feelings attached to them.

But gypped (and most of the other words and phrases in your linked article) are on a significantly difficult level. They're so far removed from their racial origins that you literally had to explain to several adults why it could possibly have any connection to something racist.
I won't say that the word and it's origins in and of itself isn't created from racial stereotypes but when someone goes to their mental word cabinet to choose a word for ripped off they don't picture a gypsy when they say gypped like most everyone probably pictures a black person when their mind touches on the n-word. They probably don't even know the word is related to gypsies in the slightest.


And so, like I said, I'm not arguing with your right to feel offended. You're welcome to feel offended and you even have some foundation to explain why you're offended. You can be offended and feel like you're the victim of racism without the ""perpetrator"" actually being racist. And so you should look not only to the word itself, but more to the intent of the speaker. Understand that words are just a way of conveying thoughts and most people who say gypped never ever even think of it as conveying a racist thought and so being accused of being racist for using it seems very, very silly to most.

Also, as long as I'm editing this because the bot caught me, think about that.

There is a reason there is a market for lamb and not for veal and it has a lot to do with people in the past finding out how veal is farmed. You might want to look in to where your veal is coming from. Waitrose veal is approved by the Meat-Farmer's own standards body ABM, not by the RSPCA, which has its own higher standards. You'll notice the Waitrose spiel on its veal does not state whether the calves are allowed to move, whether they are given space to even turn around in their stalls. Traditionally veal calves are prevented from moving at all during their lives, like battery hens, to prevent connective tissue forming in their muscles because this 'spoils' the taste. The RSPCA minimum standards for veal calves state that they should have room to walk around during the day. If the waitrose veal met the higher RSPCA standards they would say that. You're probably eating cruelty, you're probably eating a baby cow that's been held in one position all its life to stop it from using its tender muscle meat. I'm going to assume you've just never had this explained to you, next time either pay a bit more for RSPCA approved veal, or get something different. Or be basically Hitler to the poor little cows.

Where are they based? I've NW &amp; Yorkshire contacts in a few employment agencies - they're always looking for people with the right work ethic they can rely on. It'll not pay well but it's a start - and if they are smart there's always opportunities to climb that ladder (how I started out). I found work within a week; wasn't what I was after but I built their trust and they landed me something better. My graduate friend just landed a job (we're ex-mining town). Plenty out there. In fact if they're a graduate (they got any experience?) we're hiring too - and there's a nice referal bonus for me should they land it. Drop me a PM with relevant experience.

true,ReubenTuesday,cnty-scotland,Scottish-ish,"I did call them to ask about the possibility of reducing my bill for the time being but was told that as I'm already on pretty much the lowest monthly contract they offer I'm basically shit out of luck.

Yeah, toiletries aren't a massive part of my budget. I tend to get whatever decent shampoo/conditioner is available in Poundland when it needs replaced and I have a Tesco bag full of toothpaste samples that appeared from god knows where so I won't need to buy that for about a year. Feminine hygiene products are probably my most expensive spend in that area. My main problem is that the nearest supermarket that isn't a ridiculously overpriced Tesco Metro or similar is a £3 round trip on the bus and as I'm not capable of carrying very much it ends up being a weekly thing.

The internet thing was a bit of a no-brainer, my share of the bill is just under £10 a month and that's basically my entertainment budget too. Some might consider it a luxury but it's essential for jobsearching and when you take into account the price of daily visits to an internet cafe or getting the bus into town to go to the library, it works out cheaper this way.

""The Rings of Akhaten"" refers to the rings around the planet, like Jupiter and Saturn (and Neptune and Uranus for that matter), and within the rings of the said planet is where the entire episode takes place. The seven planets are the rest of that solar systems planets revolving around a star not pictured in the episode but whose light can be seen hitting Akhaten [here.](http://static.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rings-of-akhaten-sun.jpg?37d72e) Now, destroying the planet will almost certainly cause the rings to lose their current orbit resulting in the loss of the temple and the market area shown in the episode, but it seems those areas were only used in worship of the old god or for festivals related to it so 'no harm, no foul' now that the old god is dead anyway.

PS: However, I suppose the loss of a planetary body would affect the balance of gravitational pulls in the system as a whole and some other planets orbits would likely be changed, maybe some satellites orbits decline. Likely no cataclysmic consequences, though seasons on some worlds could be altered some which could seriously affect some species.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"Err no. Becuase the population of Britain and the number of jobs available have a tendency to go up or down (mainly up)- but are not directly related to each other. Therefore of course there are more people employed at this point in time than any other (loosely speaking). However if you are comparing the figure to the past (and you are) this means you don't account for the changes in popualtion numbers.

Calculating a rate provides a fair assessment to enable a comparison as it evens out the difference between the population.

Let me give you another example. Country A has a GDP of 10 billion. Country B Has a GDP of 5 billion. Assuming all citizens get to share in that wealth equally, who has the best quality of life in terms of available money? Initially it looks like A, right?

Wrong. Country A contains (for the sake of argument) 100 people. So they get 0.1 billion each. Country B on the other hand contains only 5 people, so even though they GDP is LOWER, each citizen gets a billion each (this isn't how economics works but it's fine to prove a point).

This is why when discussing quality of life, we often hear measurements in terms of PER CAPITA, I.E, per head of the population. Who has the most doctors PER CAPITA probably has great healtcare. Country A may have more doctors than country B, but as country B has fewer people it doesn't *need* as many doctors to provide equal if not better care.

And you know what, I don't normally make personal attacks but this is GCSE level education. Fucking hell man, this was touched on during SATS. Are you 12 or just so dense you can't comprehend statistics the average secondary school goer can understand? Seriously, either you've got huge gaps in your education, you're willfully misunderstanding the point, or you're trolling.

No matter the answer you've demonstrated your application of statistics to be utterly worthless.

The two-weekly signing on and targets didn't work for the way I approached my job search, but I was able to do my own search very successfully without them, going down the job centre every 2 weeks was a waste of my time, but it was all fairly pleasant and straight forward for me. I can see it being useful for people to have that regime, but I also had 2 recruiters feeding me all summer.

I have heard the Scandinavian system for unemployment is a sliding scale of your salary, down to a basic rate. 90%, 80%, down to say 50%, then a base rate after 6 months or so. This allows people to adjust, get their finances in order, re-arrange loans or whatever and it is a way to allow those that can do to recover. We do need another solution for those with long-term problems, but I think that is a better way to support the skilled unemployed.

But that's not what's proposed here. It is very clear and well proven that war with Iraq was a forgone conclusion regardless of any perceived threat. The existence of [PNAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Calls_for_regime_change_in_Iraq_during_Clinton_years) and the [Downing Street Memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street_memo) clearly show that this war was never about defence.

Blair didn't just make a bad decision, he choose to **lie** &amp; mislead people to manipulate evidence to support a pre-written conclusion. You can read the full leaked memo [here](http://downingstreetmemo.com/memos.html), it was from a meeting on **23 July 2002**, i.e. long before the war:

&gt; C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.

This is **in their own words**. It's worthwhile reading the other memos on the site as well. These were criminal acts. ",0,1365376967,null,0,false,0,c9aicjh,t3_1budgr,t1_c9aicjh,t1_c9ahyiq,null,1431638754,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This is one of the most crucial points in the debate that so many people are missing. We can sit here all day arguing about whether or not £53 is a decent amount of spending money, and whether or not benefits should give people life or survival, but the ultimate truth of this is that we are looking through things from a distorted lens: there are so many more factors than finance, stemming right back to people's childhoods and educations.

At least Amy had an old legend or something to latch onto (children crying, parallels to the Doctor) when she went out on a limb with the Star Whale. They could have at least had Mary Gallele (? I can't find how to spell her name anywhere) drop a line that helps to connect possibilities with memories to let Clara (read: the audience) make that logical leap.

I don't know, it felt devoid of emotion.

But even now... I feel like the reason Doctor Who hasn't been feeling like Doctor Who is Eleven? Not Matt Smith's fault, it's the writing of his character. Something's been up with him all season. He has not been... Doctor-y. From straight up murdering Argus Filch in Dinosaurs on a Spaceship (why did no one call him on that?) to how he treated Kahler-Jex in A Town Called Mercy (thankfully, Amy yells at him here, her best moment all season IMO), it's obvious that it was not just about losing the Ponds. 

The one thing that really made me go ""wait, whoa, WHAT?"" was a line from The Power of Three, though. The Doctor is talking to Science Lady Lethbridge-Stewart about the cubes being nigh impregnable and he says ""That's impressive. I don't want them to be impressive. I want them vulnerable with a nice Achilles Heel."" 

At this point, the cubes have not shown any indication of aggression or malice, they are made of something that the Doctor cannot identify and they are completely mysterious and beautiful and amazing and strange and something completely new and this is the shit the Doctor BREATHES but he's only focusing on finding their weak spot so that he can destroy them.  He doesn't care what these cubes are doing, he just wants to kill them fast. Since when is the Doctor more focused on destroying things he doesn't understand than trying to understand them?

Advocating 'forced economic migration' (euphemism of the day) from the largest conurbation of peoples (and pretty much the only 'functioning' (natch) economy in the country) to 'free up living spaces' for some miasmic potential Jungian 'Nurse, or Other-Worthy' (there are only so many jobs in Media &amp; PR in London, soz.) is wildly wooly-headed thinking and therefore muggy bonehead.

The pensions are there to ensure that they have an income in their retirement, as they likely don't earn enough in their jobs to live comfortably and save up for their retirement.

Public sector pensions, which form the majority of the pension bill, are set between a half and two-thirds of a person's finishing salary when they retire. The pension contributions that they have made only roughly cover 1-2 years of their pension. Their entire tax contributions only cover their pensions for 15-20 years (So if a person retires aged 60, by the time they are 80 they are in net profit from pension income). These pensions are essentially *deferred wages*, not benefits. I'm all for cutting the public sector pensions and increasing public sector wages significantly to balance it out.

* A massive problem with Cambridge applications is people not applying when they ""should"", because they think they shouldn't. Don't put it on a pedestal; if you think you can meet the academic requirements, and like how the place looks and feels, apply; just as you would any other University
* Switching to History would involve a massive time/effort commitment. Do you really want to do that? Do you enjoy History? Probably don't do it if the answers to those two questions aren't ""yes"". Do things you enjoy.

true,tomcat23,null,null,"I started watching Doctor Who in 1982!

I sometimes find it frustrating that the discourse here on /r/doctorwho  is a constant ""Look at the t-shirt I *bought*"". But at the same time, when each new episode rolls around I'm very thankful to the universe that it has given me the sentience and longevity to enjoy it. That I get to see another thread in the great tapestry that is this show's story. 

And that I get to share it with everyone else. 

Let me tell you all something else. I know, /r/doctorwho isn't a terrific place for conversation, but please indulge me. Back in 1983 or so, in Phoenix where I lived, the local weekly alternative (The New Times, which is in several cities in the US by now) paper used to run free personals. This is back in the days of the Commodore 64 and long before anyone had Internet, or Usenet, or heck even Fidonet or BBS systems. But there was Doctor Who on the local PBS channel, and the Whovians out there started posting personals back and forth to each other in the back pages of this paper. (I ended up meeting and befriending some of them -- am still friends with ""Rassilon"" all these years later!)  And then the Duranies showed up. Yep, fans of that new pretty-boy band Duran Duran started a flame war which played out week after week, until the paper stopped accepting free personal ads a year later... 

I mention this because it's important for all you NuWhovians to know that this grand myth of the show is yours. Yours to mold, shape and dream with. If there's one thing The Doctor would certainly agree with it's that you are unique and wonderful and this myth, for however much *the show* gets it wrong,  is shared with you.

Yes, the whole ""this is the story of my death"" ending with ""but it's just on paper, actually I'm alive and happy and still saving universes, and the Doctor knows this"" was very clever.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; BAM, that's when he regenerates. But no, nothing ever came of that episode because nothing RTD writes ever has any consequence (a shame too, because the same year he wrote Children of Earth)

Name two things in Moffat's run that had any consequences at all. Go on, I dare you.

Then try and explain why I should believe the consequences are anything except real-world production issues, and will cease to matter once the actor is available for another episode.

I mean, Moffat blew up an entire universe, and magically remembered it back into existence. Consequences? Yeah, right.

He even killed Rory and that had so many consequences that it became a running joke *in the god damned show*.

You think Amy &amp; Rory are time-locked and will never be seen again? Please. As Moffat has explained repeatedly, the Doctor lies, and just because he *said* they can't come back, that doesn't mean a damned thing.

&gt; Do also remember that the entire of The Big Bang is the Doctor altering time to his will. He escapes the Pandorica by, almost literally, going back in time and bribing the architect (I pray every single one of you will get that reference). In the face of the entire universe ending... he decides that fezzes are cool. THIS is Time Lord Victorious. 

No, that was Bill and Ted Victorious - and completely free of consequences.

Those who defend the amounts given , show with reasonable frequency, that when you actually do the sums, benefits do not support a lavish lifestyle. They are in actuality worked out in line with the cost of living and the things people need in order TO survive.   Those who attack the system do not attack the money by listing the amounts ( unless they use housing prices to inflate figure- see DM ) and doing the same sums. what they do is point to items of an unknown provenance ( Tellys, trainers, phones) and bellow about how expensive they are...
If the amount I receive was excessive it should be relatively easy for any hack journo to get an equivalent amount shop in Tesco and show how much luxury food etc they can afford for the same money,   notably they never do. so- whilst the sarcasm was probably unfortunate it may have illustrated better than I thought what the issue is-  many people do not expect those on benefits to have anything at all decent in their life. They would be more comfortable if they lived in abject and visible misery- and in that I am not actually being sarcastic. if those on benefits wore rags and queued at church for soup wearing grateful expressions then their detractors could feel noble - and in control.

Yes, because stuff like this is factually provable.

Google ""social mobility"" - there have been studies done on this (although I think it's a relatively new area of research, and will become better established in coming decades).

Most people talk about politics in terms of ""my opinion is as good as yours"" and using a high-school level of logic.

Since I know nothing about football, I wouldn't presume to discuss the subject with you. If we're building a road bridge then the only important ""opinion"" is that of a qualified engineer. How, then, is it ok to discuss politics based only on general knowledge and intuition?

How informed are most of the ""opinions"" you see here? Are they as good as the engineering graduate's ""opinion"" about how to build a bridge? 

Most people tend to believe things that they want to believe - for them political debates are an act of rationalisation, retrospectively collecting only the facts that suit them, supporting the conclusions they already hold.

Facts and statistics about poverty are already widely available - for many statements one makes on a demographic basis (such as ""poor people work less hard than those with wealthy parents""), you don't have to ""think"" or ""suppose"" whether they're true, there's probably an academic who has conducted a study.

If you're coming, from a science or engineering background, to the study of people then it's probably best to throw away most of your assumptions before you start. And probably a lot of what you remember, or think you remember, from GCSE history, geography and biology should be taken with a pinch of salt, too.

It's probably because the Australian budget isn't in such a black hole as the british one. Political rhetoric in britain is sort of revolving around cuts at the moment, it's not like that in Australia. 

I currently have a job where I summarise radio from Australia (media agglomerator sort of thing) and just this evening I had a couple of extensive interviews talking about disability benefit. Some of the more 'right wing' talk back radio I cover is pretty harsh about people on benefits, especially some of the people that call in. Maybe you don't listen to that sort of thing, sometimes I wish I didn't have to!  &amp;#12494;( &amp;#94;_&amp;#94;&amp;#12494;)

Right. Because that's true. She really is just Companion the Companion.

Here. Let me describe an episode to you: The Doctor takes his new female companion to a strange platform floating in space. The Doctor tells his new companion something about his usual operating procedure. The companion sees a frightened little girl and chases her down. She discovers that the society is sacrificing children in order to appease a huge space monster. She realizes a deep truth about the Doctor's statement of his standard operating procedure, sacrifices an important memory, and saves the day.

""Rings of Akhaten"", right? Wrong. I just described ""The Beast Below"", Amy Pond's second episode as a companion.

The key difference, however, is that ""The Beast Below"" (which was also severely flawed) also told us something meaningful about both Amy and the Doctor as characters. ""Rings of Akhaten"" told us basically nothing except ""Clara loved her mom"", which is the storytelling equivalent of telling us that she breathes oxygen.

During the nadir of RTD's run on the show, he started recycling his own stories using sloppy, shorthand storytelling while relying on your fond memories of the original story to carry the new one.

&gt; Very few people will accuse of you being a racist for advocating some form of immigration control. 

This might be geographically varied but the term immigration control still seems somewhat loaded. I have family and friends up north for whom the term immigration control means something entirely different to friends and family down south. I don't know for sure but I think some of this might be down to a political and class divide rather than a strictly geographical one although I might be (and probably am) wrong. It does seem like a hangover from prior Labour administrations where any discussion of immigration control was shot down under ""durr hurr racism aren't immigrants great"" type non-arguments. There has been a change (and I think that organisations like UKIP, the BNP and EDL have forced acknowledgement amongst the political classes, but we haven't seen an actual decent discussion or debate in parliament on the matter as far as I'm aware).

&gt; Also, we do have a system for being selective about which immigrants are allowed to enter. 

No we don't. It's only selective for people outside of the EU. I have skilled American friends who had to move to Portugal because of the visa rule changes, but I also have friends who have come to the UK from within the EU specifically because it was better than their home country. That's not to say they don't work hard (they do, and moving to any country is tough, just ask my wife) but I know for a fact that they wouldn't qualify if we had the same restrictions on EU citizens as we have elsewhere.

&gt; Not to mention immigrants are a net positive for the economy.

I'm not sure I agree with your point that this might be a straw man. To say immigrants are a net positive or negative is a sweeping generalisation. I think controlled immigration is a good thing and the right immigrants coming in at the right time to meet the needs of the country are a good thing too, but we don't have either.

His final points regarding ""The Big Bang"" are particularly ill-founded, IMO: Moffat spent most of the season establishing the ""if you remember something, it can come back from beyond the cracks"" rule. Then he had it actually *happen* with Rory to demonstrate the principle. Having shown us the gun and then loaded the gun, he pulled the trigger at the end of the season in a really satisfying and clever conclusion.

That's good storytelling, even if you don't happen to like the story being told.

OTOH, one can directly compare this to the meta-plot of Season 6 in which Moffat's storytelling completely fell apart.

In ""The Pandorica Opens""/""The Big Bang"" we have: Misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's able to prep a loophole and come back. I thought the method and motive of assassination was clever and well established by the meta-arc of the season; I thought the rules of the pocket universe were clear and interesting; I thought the loophole was played fairly and was also joyfully clever in its execution.

But then we fast forward a season and we find ""The Wedding of River Song"": A misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's able to prep a loophole and come back.

The phrase ""life ain't fair"" is only used by people who don't understand fairness, or who are deliberately trying to muddy the issue or to actually evade being fair.

""Life ain't fair"" is the sort of statement many of us hear uttered by other people, that we echo because it sounds ""[truthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness)"", without ever actually examining it property.

Saying ""life ain't fair"" is a bit like saying ""the mountain ain't random access"" or ""your intellect isn't chewy"" - well, duh! Computer memory is random access, random access has nothing to do with mountains! Food is supposed to be chewy, your intellect isn't edible.

""Fair"" is an adjective that applies to things like rules and justice - in fact, those are things that we *can* make fair. Top entry in my dictionary for ""fair"" is ""treating people equally without favouritism or discrimination"" - that's something we can achieve (probably, more or less).

We all understand that circumstances or coincidence can contrive randomly in favour of some individual - to make them ""more fortunate"" than another. You're less likely to become a famous and recognised guitar virtuoso than someone with the same natural aptitude for music who also happens to have two parents who play in a philharmonic orchestra. You might miss out on your dream job because the bus ran late for your interview. ""Life ain't fair"" is not used to describe such genuine accidents of circumstance. 

So when someone says ""life ain't fair"", they're probably just spouting hot air - contributing nothing to the conversation - or they actively want to make or laws (or our taxation or whatever) less fair. 

I hope that answers your question.

In response to the statement about which you uttered that phrase, ""many high-earners are high-earners because they've worked hard and … many lower-earners are lower-earners for reasons beyond their control, despite having worked hard"", I would say that ""many"" isn't such a useful metric.  

In fact *most* people who are high-earners are the children of high-earners, and (to express it in shorthand) most poor people were born poor. These are provably and factually correct statements - ""many"" is irrelevant when the numbers show that ""many"" to be a statistical minority. 

Some facts: 32% of MPs, 51% of top Medics, 54% of FTSE-100 chief execs, 54% of top journalists and 70% of High Court judges went to private school. In the wider population that's only 7%. 49% of the poorest will apply to university and get in, compared to 77% of the richest (I think that things are really worse than that second statement suggests, but it is bad enough as it is).

Facts are facts and facts are available. The question you need to ask yourself is whether you're a person who wants to address our society's problems, or if you're the kind of person who waves his hands and says ""life ain't fair"" when his political views are challenged.

Not to mention you still don't go on to give very many examples. I've never heard or seen anyone accuse those wanting immigration control of being racist, not on here nor in real life. But again, this thread is about maintaining sensible debate on reddit.

Your 2nd point, we are obliged to accept EU nationals. We cannot control that, so it is a moot point unless we withdraw from the EU. We have controls on as many immigrants as is currently possible.

I agree the 3rd straw man was a bit of a bonus ball but it just occurred to me at the time. I think controlled immigration is a good thing. Sort of. A bit left-wing protectionism for my liking, but if that's what people agree is desired then that's what should happen.

&gt;The right immigrants (from outside the EU) are less interested in coming here because of the economy and shitty visa rules, and we lack controls for immigration from within the EU. 

Agreed. So outside the EU we do have controls. And inside the EU we cannot control atm. So the actual issue of control is kind of irrelevant for the time being, and EU membership needs to be addressed. If we want to be part of the EU then that is one of the conditions that must be met.

Also, this is not a debate about immigration. This is a debate about making sweeping generalisations and tarring people with the same brush. OP started off raising some very good points about Tory bashing, and anyone advocating welfare reform as being evil. But the point we are discussing was poorly made and fell straight into the sort of behaviour being complained about i.e. accusing anyone of being pro-immigration of labelling anyone who disagrees as a racist, which is both a straw man, at least on reddit, which is the topic of discussion, but also it is a huge tarring brush.

I didn't get my housing benefit because I had done a 36 hour week and a 30 hour week. BUT It was rare I'd get those hours and would sometimes end up with 2 or 3 weeks on £96 ish pounds...

No income tax relief (working tax credit) as you have to be either an immigrant, have a kid or be over 25 - at the time of me applying. May have changed now?

So take your nonsense else where, you uneducated arse.

I used to know a lass with a crippled leg, who was in constant pain from it. When I first knew her she was mostly in a wheelchair, although she could get around the house with a stick. It's only modern prosthetics [\(like this\)](http://i.imgur.com/uwujEeZ.jpg) that have given her a bit more mobility, but she still has to take opiates on a regular basis, because she's in constant pain.

My friend was ""fortunate"" in that her disability was caused by a lorry-driver running her over on her bicycle, so she got a decent pay out. But one could be born with such a disability, or it could occur [as a result of illness](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1axfgm/my_hand_after_meningitis/c91mxhc) or some kind of accident which no insurance covered. 

It seems to me like attitudes have shifted and that we now live in a ""we shouldn't support them"" society. I feel that a decade or two ago it would be accepted those with disabilities were entitled to a modest stipend and that we'd be glad if they were able to find work, but we wouldn't place demands upon them to do so. Now (I think) the disabled must sell their home to get any support from the state, and we must put them to work at all costs.

This is not borne out by the [largest study done on poverty in the UK](http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/monitoring-poverty-2012) which indicates that it is because of the low-pay/no-pay environment that is being fostered.

&gt;Having lived on a council estate, I haven't a whole lot of sympathy for the able, long-term unemployed. 

Wut? What does you having sympathy have to do with this? I grew up on a council estate too. I do have sympathy for the long term unemployed - especially those who've been looking for jobs, doing all the right things and simply can't find one.

&gt;The economy is terrible too. I've been in the position of applying for work like that even with decent qualifications, so that needs to be sorted out. As it also leads to such a great waste in potential if we have university graduates stacking shelves for free on workfare, etc. It would be better if there were decent training and skilled industry jobs available to help stop such waste, and help people fulfil their potential.

Riiight. So first you say they're probably unskilled, unemployable chavs and in the next paragraph you say you've been in the same position as an overskilled employable individual. Which is it?

&gt;So I'd rather we provide hard-working people with the opportunity to work and improve themselves, regardless of nationality.

Wouldn't we all? It doesn't change the fact that there are far more candidates than jobs at the moment - hence we have a **suitable** pool of native applicants and simply don't need to invite cheap immigrant labour here.",0,1365415531,null,0,1365415712,0,c9asq1f,t3_1bwo4z,t1_c9asq1f,t1_c9asou4,null,1431633792,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It's not impossible but it is very difficult. You can't argue with the numbers - 1700 applications for 8 jobs.

&gt;The problem that the government brings up with the welfare state mostly relates to the unemployable chavs, rather than people who are just out of work temporarily. The former do exist, and are a problem, yet this is ignored because it's a difficult problem to solve. 

I agree the former exist, but the goverment **don't** differentiate between the two. They encourage you to view everybody as the former as it makes it more politically acceptable to start cutting all benefits left, right and centre. See all the recent rhetoric about scroungers/strivers.

&gt;But my point is that the skilled, capable workers shouldn't be applying for such jobs in the first place. That is what needs to be fixed. Not pushing out immigrants to artificially increase the demand for unskilled work as a stopgap measure. Skilled workers should be in skilled work, and pushing out immigrants won't help to solve this problem at all. And so blaming immigration is just a smokescreen for the real economic issues.

That's too idealistic to be at all plausible. We're always going to have native 'unskilled' workers. Inviting immigrants to compete for the same jobs isn't helping anything, it's just making things more difficult for the most vulnerable. Some of those who've suffered most are the working disabled - i.e. those with learning difficulties. If the local Asda are looking for someone to push trolleys on the weekend do they choose the young native applicant with down's syndrome or do they choose the recently arrived immigrant who can work twice as fast? I think we both know the answer, whatever the law says.

true,Ch13fWiggum,eng-Herefordshire,Herefordshire,"&gt;Something I don't quite understand is that Saddam had been doing those things for a while, but nothing was done until after Afghanistan

Well You've got to consider the invasion in the context of what came before, The no fly zone and sanctions.

Now the No fly zone was costing something in the region of £2bn per year (I don't remember if that was just to the UK or to the UK and the west in general, I think it was the former but I cannot be 100%). So there was the idea that removing Saddam cheaply and efficiently (see rushed invasion and minimal post-war planning) would lead to greater savings in the long run, especially when you consider the Saddam's son Qusay (who was being groomed for leadership post-Saddam's death, would be cut from the same jib) would require the same no fly zone.

There are then the links to Al-qaeda, Now don't get me wrong there weren't direct links between AQ and Saddam's regime, but there were links between the situation in Iraq pre-invasion and AQ namely...

* the Kurdish Autonomous zone in the north allowed for affiliated groups to set up training camps there (see [Ansar-ul-islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Islam) and their predecessor)

* The 3rd most commonly cited situation in pre-afghanistan AQ propaganda was the effects of the UN sanctions on Iraq (after Chechnya and Israel/Palestine) 

Now the Sanctions Regime did also get a lot of grief from the domestic left in the UK, with a lot of emphasis coming from Galloway and his ilk. it basically allowed Hussein to shore up his base in places like the anbar provinces (by forcing tribal arabs in these region to compete for smaller favours) as well as hurting the shi'a opposition in the south, by denying medicines and food supplies (from the oil for food programme) to those in the south.

Now if you take it that the cause of these issues (the sanctions and the no fly zone) needs to be stopped you have two options...

* end the sanctions regime and leave Saddam in power

* Remove Saddam from power so the sanctions are no longer required

The foremost option would have been the more palatable to a number of  Permanent UNSC members (France had contracts for oil once the OfF programme had finished, as did China, and Russia had strategic agreements with Iraq as they do with Syria). However this would have been unacceptable to the US (under either Bush or Clinton, or any of the alternates) - it would also allow Saddam to accrue regional power through an anti-imperealist discourse that holds sway in international politics in the Arab Middle East.

So Why after Afghanistan? well for starters, they couldn't do it before Afghanistan because war is unpalatable to citizens in democracies. You also have the fact that before Sept 11th nobody really cared if a rag-tag bunch of muslims were running around on remote hillsides firing AK47s, much less cared about the propaganda that was being spouted by them. However Sept 11th changed that - all of a sudden AQ was at the forefront, and all of the causes were being looked at, The Russians were dealing with Chechnya, nobody's going to solve Israel/Palestine quickly and easily - so what's left. The removal of Saddam and by that act the removal of the sanctions regime that is causing people to Join Al-Qaeda.

Now I'm not saying that this was a smart move, but the main ideology behind some of Bush's advisors (not all by any means) was the neo-conservatism of the 1980's - that is guided by democratic peace theory (i.e. no two democracies have gone to war against each other*) - the theory being that if you replace a dictator with a democracy the new regime will be more hospitable to the White Knights that overthrew the oppressors. These people were behind a letter in the late 90's that called for Clinton to depose Saddam, so they were always going to push Bush (who wanted to be remembered for an isolationist eduction based presidency) into deposing Saddam, and that only became possible after Sept 11th, and in turn would only be palatable after the went through Afghanistan)

*There is some merit to the theory; however democracies are not less warlike than autocracies, they just don't tend to declare war on other democracies.

But sticking with your suggestions - you can *guarantee* that they've never used the word *anywhere else ever* that a journalist might be able to discover, yes? You *know* that *all* of their FB comments have included you as well, right?

Despite this, I'm not sure any of it really matters, at the end of the day.

I don't wear dresses, because they're girly. My saying so is not demeaning to women, it's stating that I'm not into looking feminine. If I say that I'm averse to something because it's a bit gay, why is that homophobic? Isn't that deliberately seperating the word from normal use? I'm actually using the word in the same context as before, which is how acceptable and *non-offensively* the word can be used - anything read into it beyond that point is someone else projecting their own issues. Its the difference between using a word purely descriptively, and using it to reinforce prejudice/ bigotry etc. (as in, 'I won't wear a dress because it's girly *and girls are shit*'). Derek and Clive used swear words in a funny way - shall we prosecute them for using offensive language anyway? We've been down this road, many years before, with the famous 'fucking in the streets' Oz trial being the test case for taking stuff out of context for dubious purposes. Good to see the press are pretending we haven't.

Most of the other comments I've seen attributed to her are along these lines - great for the press (or someone with an axe to grind), but don't really mean much. Kids (and Tarantino) use 'Nigga' all the time - to the point where the black girl who caused upset on Big Brother when another girl said it (Charlie, was it?) was actually being more racist than the girl she was complaining about.

I work with someone that has a coffee mug that says 'touch my coffee and I'll cut you' - shall we sack them? After all, that's practically an assault. Shall I sack the people that can't understand the HP heldesk in India because of their accents and discuss this as an issue with others? I mean, such bigotry and racism simply cannot be allowed (etc. - I personally think it's racist for someone with no base or grounding in the UK to pretend that their name is 'Eric' for the purposes of an offshore call-centre, but there you go).

This is laughable PC-stuff.

true,jimothyjim,cnty-england,Sussex via Cornwall,"Interestingly, I first joined Reddit because I saw the pun threads and f712u stuff and thought ""that's kind of funny"". Then about about a month later I'd check the comments on an interesting news article to be greeted by the same pun threads I first joined for, and be instantly annoyed. Current me would have hated new-to-Reddit me.

The frontpage genuinely seems to have a few weeks of content, then after that it's basically repeats but with slightly different situations. The problem is, people normally  join for the stuff they see on the frontpage so that stuff grows, and the people who would genuinely enjoy the smaller subreddits are instantly put off joining because they have no interest in it. 

I'm glad I looked around so I had some worthwhile (yes I know I'm starting to sound like I think I'm better than the reddit masses)
 content to stick around for after the low effort stuff got old. There's still a few disagree=downvote people that try to ruin 98% of subreddits, this one included, but at least I can find those opinions  just below the popular opinions, as opposed to completely buried under 400 comments of circlejerking and puns. 

I think if you show a friend Reddit you should show them a subreddit you think they'd like, as opposed to just namedropping Reddit and have them end up straight on the frontpage. For more specific hobbies/interests, I much prefer Reddit to conventional forums. Plus it's just one username for ALL communities instead of registering on 48349834 different forums. 

Edit: Also it took me longer than it should have to realise that a lot of the intelligent looking comments aren't actually always that great. Most places I'd been before made it easy to see the bulllshit because theyd typ lyk dis and 9/10 times it'd be something stupid. I got worryingly close to losing my own opinions just to fit in.

**Ex-Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher dies**

Former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher has died at 87 following a stroke, her spokesman has said.

Lord Bell said: ""It is with great sadness that Mark and Carol Thatcher announced that their mother Baroness Thatcher died peacefully following a stroke this morning.""

Baroness Thatcher was Conservative prime minister from 1979 to 1990.

She was the first woman to hold the post. Her family is expected to make a further statement later.

Someone that doesn't have a closed mind toward the things that can happen in the universe.  Let alone what this companion means in the storyline itself at the moment.  The impossible girl.  The one that shouldn't be.  All that stuff.

Not to mention on the first episode of this part of the season, she was indeed almost useless to begin with.  She had the quirky personality, yes.  The most special thing that happened to her was being uploaded and getting all that information.  (Which will likely come up later.)  But none of that even has to do with the issue at hand.  Her coming to the rescue at the end of this episode.

That has nothing to do with anything but what she has overheard during her travel for the day.  Meaningful things.  Items with imprints becoming more and more valuable as they are more cherished.  They were offered as a sacrifice during the last few scenes by the aliens.  All of that information, combined with the Doctor compelling her with the ""We do not walk away"" helped her to make her decision.  

As for the leaf itself?  How would it not have that much of an imprint?  All of the importance her father put upon it along with her mother to keep it in that book.  The fact that their entire marriage and lives from that point on was based on that one piece of their lives.  That story passed down to Clara from her mother and father most likely.  The importance that she dedicates to it along with the understanding that it stood for that love and life that never got to be is what she knew.  She understood it and likely thought deeply of it often.  Only to know to use it at that key moment when every piece of string came together.

That is not a moment of her upstaging him.  If anything, it was a moment of him providing her the opening that she needed to come to that realization.  And he was willing to possibly sacrifice himself and his thoughts and memories to see it through.  It is the moment he sees in every human being, at least from what he has said through each of his last few incarnations.  He cultivates the possibility and allows it to become reality.

However, I see mixed pictures. My dad was unemployed for a large chunk of the 1980s, and he would still rather see Thatcher in office than Tony Blair. 

On the other hand, I know people of a similar age to my dad, hugely successful, who have been willing her death for years, and will no doubt pop a cork following the news today. With these people I ask them if they think they owe anything to Thatcher as it was the economic climate under her terms in office which made them phenomenally rich (they worked in the City of London - we're talking huge houses in Hampstead). They struggle to respond, and just come up with some champagne socialist rhetoric. 

For me, I grew up in a home which transitioned from working class to lower middle class in my childhood. Do I think the opportunities I had then are better than kids in a similar position today? Yes, I do - I have certainly created a life which is better than my parents, mainly through education. I think that's a struggle today - mainly because of poor education, for which I think Labour and the Conservatives are to blame.

It's amusing how people fail to see the connection between the US neocons obsession with Ayn Rand, and the UK Tories obsession with the US neocons.

How they fail to see the obliteration of UK manufacturing industries in favour of banking and finance and then 30 years later having the biggest financial meltdown the planet's economic systems have ever seen, with widespread and endemic fraud, criminal money laundering, libor fixing scandal and constant misselling, all the while tax avoidance by corporations on an unprecedented scale.

If all of you were alive in 1979, most of you would still vote for her because you cannot see the bigger picture, or are just too selfish, yet you would all bitch about getting fucked over by the system.

All her policies have failed. For instance, privatisation has not created more or better choice, nor put power into the hands of the consumer. It has just created industries that now cost more and are more subsidised then when nationalised. The only winners are the corporations that bought into them and their shareholders.

A deregulated financial system, as I've already mentioned, is a cesspit directly because of what her government did.

When she was in power, she was a bully that was brought down by the one guy she would rip into the most, Geoffrey Howe.

If I may expound on my point a moment; bertbarry seems to imply there is an objective standard of respect that Thatcher deserves. This is curious; as I know of no such standard. 

Whether people could ever get what they 'deserve' is mysterious to me; who knows what anyone deserves? I don't think I am in any position to judge what a person merits or doesn't merit. 

To suggest we discover the standard via [democracy/upvotes+downvotes/mob rule] would lead us to conclude that what a person deserves is *based* on the opinions of others. This is essentially circular, subjective, and ever changing. 

**TL:DR**; Thatcher *won't* be treated with the respect she deserves; because we don't know what respect she deserves (if any). we don't know what respect *anyone* deserves.

For a start just examine the writer and performer, Frank Turner, who was educated at Eton and studied at the London School of Economics, clearly financed by his investment banking dad (who would almost certainly have been one of the beneficiaries of the type of politics mocked in the song). I'm not saying his background excludes him from any particular political viewpoint, but he's no ""working class hero"".

He described himself as a ""libertarian"" although he's also called himself right-wing. I think the most telling lyric in this song is:

&gt; But you just closed your eyes to the other side. Of all the things that she did.

She was also unpopular in Ireland due to her uncompromising approach towards seperatist Irish republicans.

Perhaps ultimately she was painted as a power-crazed manwoman by her own party, as part of a widespread power struggle.

But Thatcher also has her devoute supporters to. Like all things in life the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","You have to understand that we're a totally different country politically to the US, and even more so thirty years ago.

Because we're not comprised of a whole bunch of semi-independent states and we had a lot of nationalised industries at the time, it is possible for a single central government to make policy decisions with ramifications felt all over the country. Back in the 1970's, the UK had a **lot** of heavy industry. Particularly in Wales (mostly coal mining), the Midlands (lots of car makers), and the North (mining and steelworks) - local economies consisted of towns and villages where a huge percentage of the adult male population worked down the mine/at the steelworks.

Many of those industries were in a pretty bad way by the time Thatcher came to power. AFAICT (and I'm too young to be able to give first-hand answers, though I'm sure others can fill bits in), Thatcher took the attitude that those industries were beyond recovery and the economy would need to be completely re-thought. She made very little effort to help those industries adapt and modernise (though many didn't do much to help themselves - coal, for instance, was heavily unionised and any modernisation that might result in job losses was pretty much guaranteed to result in every damn coal mine in the country going on strike).

When those industries started to collapse, that was it. Little effort was made to encourage alternative businesses to the areas affected; entire towns were made redundant almost overnight. Even today, some thirty years later, there's an enormous wealth gap - particularly in the Welsh valleys and the North East.

Perhaps not coincidentally, many of those industries were in areas where pretty much nobody would have voted for Thatcher even if she'd shown up in person and given every single affected person a new job with better wages and better conditions.

During her time in office, she had the second lowest approval rating of any post-war Prime Minister.

She was certainly loved by partisans, but support for Regan was mainstream while support for Thatcher was always a minority opinion, and that minority severely shrunk over her time in office.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"Well my grandfather lost his job as a result of her policies.

He worked as an electrical engineer, making gauges for industrial process machinery, effectively he was what people would call a consultant nowadays on controlling high power factory type things.

The problem was he was caught in a cross fire, the coal miners strike, the resulting 3 day working week (electricity was rationed due to the coal shortage) ment such a downturn for his line of work he ended up changing industry forever.

However, Thatcher is no more to blame than the unions, they had a hard line attitude towards pit closure, given the fact it was a massively state subsidised industry, that these miners were better paid than someone like my grandfather, despite it been obviously unsustainable.  I kinda side with Thatcher on taking a hard line on it.

The problem for me isn't that Thatcher closed the mines, many of them that was inevitable, it was that she closed *all* the mines, pretty much at once.  If the workers had been given opportunities to retrain, phased the closing of the mines over a longer period of time things would have been better.

This is pretty much the issue, Thatcher did a lot wrong, but so did the miners strike.  People down south just had the negative impact of the miners strike such as the 3 day week.

I always found it odd to see the quality of the roads in Wales vs Cornwall.

However in a way it has kind of done well.  When any recession happens Cornwall doesn't really do too badly, because the little economy it has aside from tourism is quite stable and has been sustainable.  Compared to the government subsidised projects which tend to be less sustainable.

I'm not sure the objective one status funding has really helped make Cornwall a profitable location.

However the delivery it should stop. But I think people concentrate on perpetrators because most people I know when shown a victim feel ""guilted"" for some reason, like they are being blamed for something. When shown a former perpetrator you almost feel a sense of pride in the fact that they saw their errors and changed for the better. maybe an odd example but think of Edward Norton in American History X. there is an element of pride for him since he changed his views and tried to turn his life around. If he had simply gone to prison for his crimes and the story concentrated on the victim, the films message wouldn't have the same impact. I see advisor's in the same light almost. A racist child for example, won't listen to a victim of racism since they don't respect them, but a person who can say ""I've been there"" and explain why they don't want to be there again and how any non-racists look upon them with shame, that can cut deep.

You are assuming that a country's economic power and its quality of life are one and the same thing. She may have got the numbers into the green, but she did a lot to damage the quality of life in Britain and forever changed what it meant to be British which nobody can put a price on.

MPs aren't going to spend hundreds of millions extending the motorway beyond Exeter when there are no votes for the dominant party in it. I always found it odd to see the quality of the roads in Wales vs Cornwall.

I completely agree, although it's interesting how Plymouth always got left out considering it's a very Labour vs Conservative city. They only really have the naval base (which is at risk) and maritime activity going for them. 

It's very interesting to see how South Wales in particular has a lot of investment thrown at it - gleaming new railways, motorway junctions to every shack, public sector expansion, the works. Meanwhile Cornwall gets fuck all apart from a couple of small dual carriageway projects (which are really badly needed and well overdue) after the council kicks up a stink. I believe South Wales is quite Labour whereas Cornwall is very Lib Dem. A coincidence?

&gt; However in a way it has kind of done well. When any recession happens Cornwall doesn't really do too badly, because the little economy it has aside from tourism is quite stable and has been sustainable. Compared to the government subsidised projects which tend to be less sustainable.

I can somewhat agree. My dad isn't in tourism (he's a mechanic) but business has never been better for him, people are choosing to repair rather than buy new. But then who the hell can afford to buy a new car even in the good times?

&gt; I'm not sure the objective one status funding has really helped make Cornwall a profitable location. A friend of mine is setting up a software firm there purely because he can pay people so much less whilst giving them a much better quality of life than they'd find in any city. He is moving three other people with him and hiring two local people. The grants available for this venture are pretty much zero. The only real benefit is the FTTC.

I don't think that's a great strategy. I am in IT myself but am going to be moving to the South East soon simply because you get paid so much more. I don't think that paying substantially less (15-20k) for the same job just because it's in Cornwall is a good plan. Cornwall isn't *that* much cheaper to live in. Property prices are insane, you will probably need a car, stuff is still expensive due to geography etc. There aren't many jobs for my specific bit of IT down here (network engineering) but even if there was why would I live here when I can earn so much more up country?

Also the second half of series 7 has honestly been my favourite who series in, well, ever as far as the new series goes.  I've said this before but with this series I love the feeling that Moffat is sort of brining the Doctor back to his roots and this most recent episode further enforces that theory.  I honestly hope now that the Doctor can finally accept and let go of his feelings and self-doubts since his 8th version ended the Time War.  Perhaps return to the old worry/care free days of pre-9.  

The homages, especially in series 7b, are becoming quite heavy.  more so than any other of the new series.  The theme song is heavy again on the ""heart of the timelord"" part.  The face in the intro.  the references (finally bringing up Susan again, wow) other small tidbits to previous series in the new generation but pre-moffat.  The, as you said, Sarah-Jane vibe you get from Clara.  As well as what we know thus far about the 50th episode with the return of Rose and 10.  Heck even bringing back the great intelligence is digging deep in who lore for villans.  I for one like this.

What constantly amazes me is the inherently combative nature of the relationship between management and workers.

It's really only the western interpretation of labour relations that seems quite so adversarial.

I can say that I don't know of any helpful union representatives, and I felt that the structure of the union was what hindered me in my job in the first place.

I couldn't launch a complaint because the union advised me I'd be blackballed. I couldn't ask the union to defend me, because that'd make me look bad for future prospects.

&gt;Am I correct in thinking (from something I read in the ELI5 thread) that coal mining etc wasn't profitable anyway at that point so even though it sucked it made economic sense to close the mines?

It wasn't profitable in the slightest. Essentially what happened with the coal miners it that the rest of the country had to pay fairly seriously increased taxes in order to subsidise the coal mines which were generally running at a loss before subsidy.

You're pretty much spot on, it sucked because there were 200,000 or so miners in the UK, which was a fair old number and enough to kick up a stink, especially because with the trade unions being so strong back then a lot of their strikes were also helped by other trade unions.

It is similar to reading history textbooks. If you wanted to understand what happened during, say, Winston Churchill's meetings with Stalin and Roosevelt during WW2, you wouldn't limit yourself to just one book about Churchill. Even a book exclusively about the topic does not contain all the information. If you are interested in a subject, you have to read around it from similar viewpoints as yours and opposing. 

I do not believe there is such a thing as a neutral perspective, because there is no reason to write about something if you don't care yourself.

Firstly, the jobs that would be created would be a nice boost to the economy as a whole: the builders, the suppliers, the logistics, the extra cash circulating throughout the money system, etc.

If these houses were social houses, then they would be able to charge a fair rate for rent, rather than the inflated, high-demand led prices we have now. This means more people can afford their homes, so less defaults, more money in the economy, and most importantly, lower welfare payments in the form of housing benefit. This would not only affect those within the new housing, though, but everyone else. By reducing demand in the private sector, rents would cease to increase and we wouldn't have this situation of the landlords enriching themselves on public money, while the tenants are seen as the greedy ones.

I was a teacher in Ontario, Canada, a province which has an extraordinarily saturated market. The hiring practices of most boards of education in the province are strongly patronage-based, and discussions about this with the union have yielded usually results around 'don't complain, because as a teacher you're starting out, and it will look bad in your future career.'

I don't deny that unions aren't inherently corrupt, I just find that at this point, many unions exist for their own self-perpetuation rather than workers' rights. I've had 'secret votes' presided over by union local heads, where we had to vote in front of them and hand in our votes as such, and I've also had to attend disciplinary meetings where I met my representative for the first time hours before, with no real helpful advice given. 

Generally, I found that the dues I paid and the protection I received were strongly disproportionate, and after reading as much as I usefully could on the subject, I do not believe that unions are helpful except in a handful of situations that deal with migrant or seasonal workers (As in unions for hospitality, health and food service workers) and careers where danger is an inherent part of the line of work, such as railway, infrastructure repair, etc. I don't honestly think that in many other situations unions are justified at all given the changes in labour climate over the last several decades.

For example, in Italy I witnessed constant racism directed as immigrants; this included posters plastered all over the city attacking the African immigrants.

On a larger scale, the backlash against immigration across Europe has been accompanied by vitriol racism. Yet even when I was in Italy witnessing all these atrocious cases of racism, people still looked at me with a straight face and told me ""Americans are racist""

America is not ""completely racist"", far from it. For me, this all stems from the myth that Europeans are more progressive than Americans (we're both progressive goddamnit).

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;I believe South Wales is quite Labour whereas Cornwall is very Lib Dem. A coincidence?

You sound like my dad, that is his theory, at least when he isn't ranting about a certain dairy products firm's exodus.

&gt;I can somewhat agree. My dad isn't in tourism (he's a mechanic) but business has never been better for him, people are choosing to repair rather than buy new. But then who the hell can afford to buy a new car even in the good times?

Also its quite a bit better for the environment to fix rather than build new.  I find it rather funny in a way that my company car will be replaced soon, despite been been less than 3 years old.  It's tax advantageous to churn cars.

&gt;I don't think that paying substantially less (15-20k) for the same job just because it's in Cornwall is a good plan. Cornwall isn't that much cheaper to live in.

Compared to London I disagree.  My 2 bed flat is worth as much (if not more) than my parents + grandparents properties together.  That is some 9 bedrooms.  I do not live in a 'fancy' part of London.

If its a choice of £100k in London or £60k in Cornwall, his hope is that people will move down there for the quality of life, short commute being able to sail (it is being started by two keen sailors).

But this is a very specific example, my point is that throwing one or two massive projects to a regional area in the hope of regenerating it, I can not think of an example which has worked long term.

As much as I'll rip on Cornwall, the fact I moved hundreds of miles away as soon as I hit 18, doesn't change the fact despite all the 'under-investment' it's not doing that badly.  If it continues to move away from less seasonal work naturally I think it will do rather well.

I do not know about this, Thatcher was a great supporter of many little jobs around the world for certain of our armed forces that fit with her world view. This included the training and equipping of those that supported the western objective. 

The British supported Operation Cyclone that equipped and trained the Taliban. Once Afghanistan was free from the Soviets it began to support organisations and individuals that agreed with its world view. Hence Bin Laden was able to build an organisation that managed to pull off 911. 

This then precipitated the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq for which Mr Blair carries the can for, now I don’t consider Mr Blair was correct but I have to ask if we had continued to support Afghanistan after the expulsion of the Soviets where would we be today?

Maggie also ensured that many communities in the UK died and pushed many people into poverty. If you live in poverty in the UK you will live for seven years less and have seventeen more years of ill health these figures are the same today as when Maggie came to power. 

So I would say that maybe she has more blood on her hands, and this is before we even look at who championed free-market economics and thus the deregulated the financial sector allowing for the 2008 crash.

true,specofdust,,Abbot. Lots of Abbot.,"&gt;So most of the hate is people that didn't realise how unprofitable they were

The thing is there were entire towns reliant on the coal mines in Northern England, Scotland, and Wales. When the coal mines were shut lots of these towns were hit really hard and some haven't properly recovered even now 30 years later. A lot of the miners just never really got jobs again.

So essentially they're unhappy because they had jobs that were OK, then Thatcher came along and they didn't have jobs anymore, and their entire town became financially depressed because a significant part of the workforce would have been either involved in coal or reliant on the money coal brought in for their economic success.

&gt;or thought that people's jobs should be prioritised over increased taxes and unprofitable businesses etc?

They rejected the idea of the pit closures and wanted the subsidies to continue indefinitely. It's important to realise that throughout the '70s the top rate of tax was between 75% and 90%, the country was considerably more left wing than it is now.

Was it socialist? Yes. The NUM (national union of mineworkers) had strong affiliations with and support by the UK communist party, and various UK socialist parties.

&gt;Ideally she would have closed the mines but also somehow created 200,000 new jobs at a similar skill level (or with training) I assume, but that's probably easier said than done.

Bingo. The mines had to be closed (despite what a lot of the anti-thatcher crowd will tell you) - the problem was that a few percent of the workforce were being made unemployed and essentially they were mostly unskilled labourers in an economy which was regearing to be as focussed on services as it was on manufacturing. Thatcher did attempt to institute training programs but by and large they were considered a failure (and rightly so), and a great number of those who were made unemployed following the closures of the coal pits never found work again, depressing not just the odd household, but entire generations of people in entire towns and regions.

The most honest way I can describe it is that the whole thing was a necessary process which could probably have been done better (although honestly, how, I do not know - it's a tough situation to have 200,000 labourers who're going to need new work - what do you do with them?).",0,1365433555,null,0,false,0,c9awf08,t3_1bwv0f,t1_c9awf08,t1_c9aw65g,null,1431631982,5,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,5

In regards to Mandela, in 1952 he was found guilty of ""statutory communism"", in 1955 tried for ""high treason"" for his involvement with the ANC. 

The Rivonia trial of 1965 was linked to his name appearing on papers seized by the SA police researching ""Umkhonto we Sizwe "" (MK) a group that sabotaged and planted bombs in defiance of the SA government, whereas at first,, he was only convicted of fleeing the country without permission and inciting strikes (source wiki).

So he wasn't a terrorist by any standards. And if he was, I wouldn't blame him, given the oppression black people and other minorities suffered from the Apartheid regime. 

That what a political prisoner is. 

People rejoice because Thatcher died. They remember the suffering Thatcher inflicted upon them or their beloved ones: miners, political activists, union-members, Chilean refugees, Northerners.

true,specofdust,,Abbot. Lots of Abbot.,"Not fully sure to be honest, they just weren't effective at getting people into work.

I suspect it was a mixture of apathy on the people's part, a lack of actual jobs to go into in the regions they were in, a desire not to move from their local area, and the lack of education that most of these guys had not being remedied by 8-16 week training courses.

These towns were *hugely* focussed on coal mining. Taking that away for the towns was like what'd happen if you took oil away from Saudi Arabia or Norway - local economies pretty much collapsed. It was a pretty messed up time but clearly from the fact that she was voted in the public wanted to stop having to subsidise the 200,000 of so miners lives, and you can't just ""magic"" 200,000 jobs to relatively remote towns and villages.

Myself I can't think of a way it could realistically have been handled better, although I do suspect it could have been, but overall a lot of that pain simply had to happen whether the anti-Thatcher folk will admit to it or not.

edit: And you're welcome of course. Although honestly if you want to learn about Thatcher at this point in time you're better off on wikipedia reading about the winter of discontent and the three day week and just getting a feel for how the UK actually *was* in the '70's before going on to read about her coming to power and what measures she took. If like me you were born towards the end or after her era was over, then you'll probably be surprised just how dysfunctional the UK was in the '70s, we were basically the poorest and the least productive western European nation (The Sick man of Europe), and had such events like dead bodies piling up in Liverpool, rationing of energy, and lots of other stuff which is just inconceivable in the UK today.",0,1365434350,null,0,1365434602,0,c9awo9t,t3_1bwv0f,t1_c9awo9t,t1_c9awlj4,null,1431631861,4,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,4

It also had a meetup for the elderly but the only result of that closing was a few old people leading more empty lives and that won't impact your finances one bit.  Ah well.   (See, I can make needlessly emotional points to back up my arguments too - dying kids, fucking weak)

As far as I know there are no schemes to aid poorer families by reducing the fee, it is paid by everyone who has a device able to receive live tv pictures (so if you had a laptop open watching a live stream of a football match from the BBC, without a licence, you would technically be in violation of the law). Prerecorded or non-live content available online is, as far as I am aware, not included and therefore you do not have to have a licence to watch it.

The general opinion is it's a bit of a non-issue. Some people refuse to pay the licence fee and can be fined for this, some out of principle, some because they are too lazy or can't afford it. Lately a developing, although currently minority argument is that as there is so much content available online and the old justification for having a fee was that it was levied upon every television set in the country is irrelevant and outdated, and a newer solution must be found.

I was talking specifically about his university attendance at a top-flight London academic establishment. As for his scholarship, it's worth noting that lots of ""scholarships"" at Eaton are really only equivalent to 10% off the full fee. I suppose his Father and his family background had nothing to do with it? Does it make it better he went to Eton on a scholarship, given his Father's position they clearly would be more able to pay, or does it make it worse?

I suppose listening to a child of a wealthy family sing about Thatcher and the Welfare State is not at all ironic?

On a side note, by personal opinion I was using the phrase colloquially to mean first-hand opinion. No I could not and do not posses a first-hand opinion of Adolf Hitler, being that he died 42 years before I was born. I have heard what history has to say about the man, and I think he sounds like a thoroughly disagreeable person, however this isn't a first-hand ""personal opinion"".

Or put even more simply (as I suspect you still dont get it), the more efficient the service the more effective the outreach as the less ""waste"" there is, by having an efficiency-centric service you actually have more impact per unit value of spending and therefore a greater good.

Amy's Choice had Amy choosing the Doctor and Rory, and she genuinely struggled with it. By the time AGMGTW aired, they had developed enough that there was never any choice, those two would stick together until the end, something that came to a nice scene in Angels Take Manhattan when Amy joined Rory on the edge of the roof.

Consequence number #2: Though it ended very poorly, pretty much all of Series 6 had the Doctor dealing with the actions he's done. This was handled briefly but quite well in Good Man, where he learns just how dangerous the mention of his name is, something that was also handled before in The Big Bang.

""When a writer does that, he does not respect the audience. He considers them to be so stupid as to accept any kind of crap the author dishes out. In particular Moffat is guilty of being thin, shallow, flashy, and not well-motivating plot-resolving developments. He just pulls them out of his ass as needed. A good writer instead sets up things before he uses them, and provides fairly believable premises. Moffat does not, he just pulls out a spectacle when he needs it.""

...really? I find that a perfect description of Journey's End. Or End of Time. Or Last of the Time Lords. 
I know as an emotional resolution, Wedding of River Song blew big time. But as a plot resolution, the Teselecta made sense, as we saw that concept built up in another episode. I'm not saying Moffat's flawless, the man has a lot of problems and Wedding still had them.
As for The Big Bang, however...

I'll go ahead and link a nice piece Andrew Rilstone wrote about Moffat's writing, which tackles your view that Moffat doesn't set up things believably before using them.

""The notion of ""rebooting the universe"" is beyond ridiculous. However, we had already been told, over a number of weeks.

a: That mysterious cracks existed in every part of the universe simultaneously

b: That they were caused by the TARDIS exploding in every part of the universe simultaneously

c: That things that go into the Cracks cease to exist retrospectively

d: That light from the Pandorica brings things that have disappeared through the Crack back into existence.

Ergo – when the whole universe is destroyed, the Doctor collides the TARDIS (explodes everywhere at once) with the Pandorica (magic bringy things back light) and brings the whole universe back. I wouldn't go so far as to say ""perfectly logical"", but...
It really all depends on the audacity of the telling. The stuff which is going on in the foreground is such fun that we are disinclined to complain, or notice, lapses in logic. I don't think anyone actually expected Amy to be properly dead; but we did expect that the Doctor would have to do something incredibly clever to save her. So far as I can tell, the actual explanation is that she's only mostly dead, and that the inescapable prison which the Doctor has just escaped from also functions as a resurrection chamber.
Obviously.
But this isn't what we see. What we see is pretty much a classic bit of conjurer's misdirection. We know that the Doctor is in the box. We know that the Doctor has to get out of the box. We know that the box with the Doctor in it is in the museum. We know that a mysterious stranger is sending messages to Little Amelia telling her to go to the museum and open the box (with the Doctor in it.)

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"The courts are formed by contract. The couple going in are forming a contract that they have a dispute (in this case divorce) and will abide by the judgement of the arbiter. This happens in civil cases all the time. Whether for divorce (and it'll be very common now legal aid is gone) or business disputes. Once you've agreed the contract the arbiters decision is legally binding.

People have and always will have the option of civil courts. That will never change. However you can't regulate the rest of society. The problem, and the reason these Sharia councils are a lesser evil, is that Imams won't carry out weddings for a legal only divorced Muslim. They'll be ostracised from their communities and become a pariah. Law or not you need a solution for this problem. This type of arbitration court is the least bad option. Before this Muslims were using Saudi courts or similar. Having British people judged by Wahabbists is not ideal and that is the alternative right now. The courts were encouraged to create a British Sharia that recognised British realities. Eventually it will probably be 100% compatible with the British norm.

The only other option we have is French style secularism. Under a French system the state holds the right to declare war on the whole mechanism of theocracy. The French would physically ban any alternative to the state system (for Christians and Jews as well). That would make all Muslims equal under the law and allow women to use the state service because it is the only service.

'more impact per unit value of spending and therefore a greater good' - and how do you measure impact exactly?  Utilitarianism is considered an extremist philosophy for a reason.

'maximum delivery of the service to everyone as a society.' - but when you close down all the services you're not servicing anyone except the corporations you can now give a tax break to.

It was a fantastic event.

I was thinking of initially developing a programme and holding a 'Code Week' in schools (sort of a takeover of certain lessons with coding), to raise awareness and interest. 

Is this something you would be interested in getting involved in as an organisation? It would add good prestige to it. Inbox me if you would like to talk further sure.

I'm tired of all this po-faced faux gravitas that is trotted out whenever a public figure dies, as if we must tread on eggshells to spare the feelings of those who have been directly affected by the bereavement.

I highly doubt anyone in this thread, or indeed sub-reddit, knew or had any personal connection with Mrs T.  I don't mean to get obnoxiously post-modern here, but I have no real conception of Margaret Thatcher 'the person', because it is impossible to do so through the lens of the news media.  As far as I'm concerned, she was an entity, a construct, not a living, breathing human person.  We may feel like we know the person behind the news stories, but we don't, it's all a figment of our collective imagination.  Any sense of solemnity around this event is no more warranted than the hysterical, ersatz street-weeping seen up and down the country after Diana had ploughed into a Parisian tunnel wall.

Perhaps that is a callous and cold hearted way of looking at it all, and I am aware that there is a real person somewhere at the centre of it all.  It just isn't in me to care - I doubt I will ever meet anyone who could claim to be *genuinely* emotionally affected by the death of Thatcher and the people here and on Twitter getting on their high horse about decency and decorum seem to be doing so out of a sense of high-handed moral point scoring rather than any real sense of offence.

So if people want to cheer now that the totem of the repellent 'i'm-alright-Jack' ideology that was Thatcherism has been felled, I say let them.

If it promises a 'brand new start' and such, regardless of experience, or says that it's something along the lines of 'breaking you into sales with no experience because we need managers' then it's probably fake.

A fair while back I had a run-in with JMS Marketing in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  They, like many hundreds of other companies across the UK at the moment, are a subsidiary (but not on paper) of the PerDM Group.  I did a bit of digging and ended up writing an exposé on them that unfortunately never went to print.

Basically, a fair time ago, two gentlemen in America put their heads together and came up with an excellent scheme; people want jobs, they want to belong, and they want money.  If you indoctrinate them in the right way, and prey upon their insecurities, you can take their money, make them think they have a job, and make them WANT to stay in that position regardless of what happens.  The two gentlemen had a bit of a row and went seperate ways however, as one was a bit mental and the other... not so much.  The mental guy is Mr L Ron Hubbard, creator of the Scientologist Religion.  The other is the founder of the PerDM Group.

You're desperate, down on your luck, and you find a job posting somewhere saying you can earn a mint and be fast-tracked to a Manager position within weeks.  You're skeptical, but you're so depressed you'll try anything, so you email your cv.  Within a day, you get a call from the company saying they want to meet you and talk because your cv wowed them and you appear to be the kind of person they're looking for!  Can you come in tomorrow morning?

Again, alarm bells because generally things take a bit longer than this, but you're overjoyed to have an interview at last.  You agree, get dressed up the next morning and go along to the address they've given.  You might at this point notice that three, four or five different advertising and marketing firms, all with similar names, are listed for the same office.  You might also notice there is only one receptionist who will generically answer the phone with ""Hello, Marketing?"".  The office is dirty, there's broken flooring and ceiling tile, and the receptionist is so orange she makes David Dickinson look pale.  But you soldier on...

You're taken to the office of the interviewer, and see that the safe for the company is held in the same room.  There's various PerDM Group awards around the room, some marketing stuff, etc.  Instead of being asked questions, the job is sold to you and you're given a head-full of shoddy maths about how door-to-door sales is amazingly effective as a strategy.  Doubt returns in earnest, but you are desperate.

Then, ""The Fear of Loss"".  This is a technique used by many thousands of people, and is a clever thing; you give someone hope, and then introduce doubt to the situation.  For example, I am the interviewer and I say something like ""Man, I really hope you get this job.  You remind me of me when I first started... I'm not sure though, I mean... we've had so many people come in and my boss is a bit hard, but I'll try for you, okay?  Thanks so much for coming in though, and fingers' crossed, huh?""

Seems like a nice thing to say until you know that it's a psychological tool to make you grasp the soon-to-be-offered job the moment you get the call (about 8pm for some reason?) saying ""I sold you to the boss, can you come in tomorrow for 8am.  It's your second interview, which takes 8 hours to complete.""

If that doesn't make you say ""Oh dear... I've been scammed"" then you may deserve the insanity you're in for the next day.  You turn up, suited and booted, and are subjected to more shoddy maths (along with all the other people who applied and got the job) along with spiel about how your job is 100% commission-based, and sign these forms so that you can do your own tax and NI contributions.  Those forms are basically self-employment declarations printed out en masse and will be sent to the Job Centre and HMRC the moment you're out the door.  It means that you're being taken on as a sub-contractor as opposed to staff, and thus for about 13 weeks, are not eligible for ANY set wage.  You're responsible for your NI and Tax returns, and you can't claim benefits at all.

You get teamed up with other people who will, en route to your pitch where you can see people ""dealing with our important customers face-to-face for hands-on experience"", use even more shoddy excuses and maths to convince you that this is an epic job, and then you reach your destination.  If you have a car, you WILL play chauffeur on this second interview; if not, you'll all go by train or bus.  You'll end up going door-to-door in a council estate, have the door slammed in your face, and then be taken out for dinner with platitudes of ""we're obviously just having a bit of a bad day, but we've only looked at 50 houses and gotten one sale; by that logic, if we check 500 houses we'll get 10 sales.  500 houses a day, for five days a week, there's 50 sales!  And you saw how we sold about £50 of gear there, so £50 times by 50 is £2500 a week!!! All commission based, so you get to use that; how awesome is that?""

It sounds good, but it isn't.  It's a cult mentality, and if your company is caught for Pyramid Scheme (which this is, because of that £2500 a week, you'll see about £100 at the most and the rest goes towards paying your boss, your boss' boss, and ultimately the guy who founded the PerDM Group), then you're only a subcontractor, have no claim to benefits because you voluntarily quit claiming to go self-employed.

negative

So if you're having trouble finding work or your pay is frozen in this post-crash economy after the banks went wild, if you're struggling with high rent/house prices or a 6 year waiting list for a council house, if your local railway is often shitty, with increasing ticket prices year on year often double or triple inflation, or huge electricity, water, and gas bills while energy and water companies publish bumper profits, then .... yes.

It's also possible she's responsible some of our distance from the utter mess that is the EU. The defence of the falklands showed that the UK wasn't willing to let other nations seize their territories or people (huge majority of falklands residents wish to remain a British overseas territory). She forced the collapse of some industries (some of which were not viable at the time), greatly diminished the power of the unions. She also tried to introduce the community charge/poll tax, which is a form of council tax that charges a fixed sum per person in a property, as opposed to what we have now, which is a variable amount relative to notional rent value of a property. It didn't work.

Basically, she did a wide spectrum of stuff. Some stuff that needed doing, some stuff that had led in large part to the massive issues facing the UK today.

And because of the things she did seemed to work, a segment of the Labour party took up those policies, got elected, and ran with them, expanded on them, until their negative effects came crashing down.

That's the problem right there. It's become too campy. What sets most folks in during the rtd era was not only was it fun, but it also made sense and everything was set up from the get go. The big bang was probably the most cringe worthy piece I've ever watched. Everything gets remained into existence, none knows what caused the t.a.r.d.i.s to explode with river inside it. And so many more things. The development was God awful. The character driven story is gone with rtd and replaced with too over the top 'fun.' Trying to make a shoddy story that feels hastily thrown together with everything about the story arch being thrown in your face leaves you with a thin story, no development whatsoever, and awful to watch no matter how 'big' it is.

There was a more, in episode, similarity drawn before Grandfather and The Doctor.

Early in the episode The Doctor mentions having brought his granddaughter there in the past.  I can't think that this isn't deliberate, why would Moffat mention Susan specifically and not just another random companion or not mention anyone else at all.  So it seems deliberate that Moffat is telling the audience that The Doctor is a grandfather

Then The Doctor goes on to explain to Clara, while sitting in the auditorium, ""They call it The Old God.  Sometimes Grandfather"".
River has referred to The Doctor being like a God in the past.

He then says 
""It's been going for millions of years. Chorister handing over to Chorister.  Generation after generation after generation""

That seems like a subtle hint at how the audience perceive Doctor Who.  For generations (what seems like millions of years) this character has been on our TV screens and each new generation comes to view it.

Her government was instrumental in the way football fans were treated in those days (no rights, needing to be controlled, basically like cattle). Football fans had a perhaps not unwarranted reputation, but the solution was not the right one. The caged pens that made Hillsborough possible were pushed for by the government, and clubs like Arsenal that didn't have them were no longer used as neutral grounds for FA Cup ties. 

The warning signs for the Hillsborough disaster were there for years, but they were ignored. There was a [similar incident at Hillsborough 8 years earlier for a game between Wolves and Spurs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtzHVe2mEN0) where a disaster was only avoided by police action on the day. 38 people were still injured. There is a reasonably large amount of anecdotal evidence that crushes in the Leppings Lane end for neutral games throughout the decade. The level of disrepair of football grounds in the 80's is unthinkable now, as well as the policing.

The real tragedy of Hillsborough is that it was totally avoidable if only someone in charge was paying attention.

I must admit though that despite absolutely loving the episode, I'm with you on the leaf plot seeming fairly weak and not very well-thought-out. In regards to why the weeping angels ever run out of food, it could be related to the way they take measured ""bites"" of your potential energy by zapping you into the past rather than zapping you out of existence altogether. Since you create a new life in the past, they're not getting all of your infinite potential energy, only the net difference between the life you had and the one you would've had. Maybe that's the significance of the leaf being destroyed in the process. But that brings us back to why the Doctor's memories (and the memories given to it by the singers) aren't also destroyed.

It's just so inconsistent too. Most users are happy to reflect on the ""good old days"" of RTD, but I remember that his episodes used to get exactly the same treatment. Lots of vague ""oh, it didn't grab me"" and ""no, I don't like the direction he's heading in"".

Like fucking hell people, if you're that poisoned against the idea that Moffat could ever write anything of value (which many commenters here seem to be), and that 11 is literally the worst contribution to Nu-Who, literally do us all a favour and just hang around /r/classicwho (and actually make it a meaningful community, rather than just making this one ""/r/ihatemoffat). Clearly Moffat's ideas are just cheap imitations of previous Doctors (which obviously *everyone* has seen), he can't be trusted to do overarching stories (where RTD's were *always* satisfying) and 11 just lacks that special *je ne sais quoi* that means you couldn't ever like him like you did 9, 10 or any other number before 11. 

I mean, one Doctor got killed by a treadmill and another walked around with a piece of celery on his jacket. And you think 11 is the most childish thing the show has ever done? Are you insane? Jesus.

We know that the Master has been given a new set of regenerations, thus we know it's possible to replenish those energy reserves, but we don't know what such a process would look like.

Or do we? Remember a certain scene in Let's Kill Hitler? Where regeneration life force is directly transferred from River to the Doctor? In fact, we later specifically learn that she used up all of her remaining regenerations, which as far as we know is 10 regenerations (she used two).

They could easily use this to explain the Doctor suddenly having another 10 regenerations (or maybe 9 if they want to consider one used up to bring him back), and further, to explain why he suddenly becomes a female (because he's using River's regeneration energy). It's a bit of a stretch, but if they wanted to, they could do it.

The reason I think Margaret Thatcher and Obama should be celebrated, based on how they were born, is because we recognise that discrimination against women and blacks is still prevalent. It's because we recognise that many people still think it's impossible to be a high ranking British politician if you're a woman or a high ranking American politician if you're black. So we hold up these examples for all to see to prove to all that it is not the rule. It's not about them as people, it's about proving that how you were born doesn't restrict you (too much).

We're not saying ""well done Obama, you're black!"" or ""Fantastic job Margaret! You were born a woman!"" What we're actually doing is ""Look, just because they were born this way, doesn't mean they couldn't succeed. You're in charge of your own destiny, not genetics!""

If we look at how things worked out in the past, we can take a stab at figuring out what will work in the future. If you don't look at the history of nations, it's very hard to get a good read on current events. The news will tell you what happens *today*, but that information is useless without context.

I know it's not compulsory, and I know the teaching at schools is pretty bad! I did history GCSE and I learned a tiny fragment of largely irrelevant material. It's disastrous.

My point is, in a democracy, it is the duty of voters to be informed. The educational system doesn't inform us, and people generally don't want to inform themselves. It might not seem that important on an individual level, but on a national scale it is going to have huge repercussions. If people don't know which policy is better, elections are decided by affability of candidates. Important issues are unduly influenced by media narrative. Vital things are simply forgotten about.

This isn't meant as a dressing-down, by the way, more an encouragement - go out and have a look at this stuff.

That *said*:

There is a huge difference between the writing style of Monsieurs Moffat and Davies, which may very well explain the division. RTD is exceptionally good at farce and camp. If you look at past examples of his work, this shows up very well, and is bound to draw in a very different crowd; Moffat has a very firm grasp of *science fiction*, and so when he writes stories that are very good from the standpoint of them being sci fi and horror, because I feel that his influences are very probably drawn from people *like* Asimov and Heinlein, and he has a very particular view on who the core audience of Doctor Who should be. You can see a very clear division here, because RTD tends to write towards a very adult audience, and I think it took the creation of something like the Sarah Jane Adventures for him to focus quite intently on the idea of writing for children. Moffat on the other hand, writes in a way that appeals more to adult *and* child audiences, because I think he very much bears in mind that Saturday prime time viewing shouldn't necessarily focus on sexuality or gender issues with a mix of melodrama, to the detriment of forcing it down people's necks - I often get the impression that like me, those concepts and ideas are far too adult for children to really understand or grasp, and detracts from the core of a story. That isn't to say that RTD doesn't know how to write or communicate with and to kids, but given his work history, I genuinely have my doubts. Despite the genuinely creep chucklevision being in there.

I think my largest problem with the RTD tenure was precisely *with* the writing - thematically, his stories tended to be extremely reptitive, single purpose, quick digestion shows, whereas Moffat opts for a much more traditional thread of telling a story with an overreaching arch. Which is interesting really, as RTD always cited Joss Whedon as an influence, but I genuinely never felt that Doctor Who achieved that kind of ideology, or the level of storytelling *until* Moffat took over as series producer.

A few more points though:

By purchasing a TV licence, you can then receive all the [TV channels and radio stations](http://www.freeview.co.uk/whats-on/channels) available through [Freeview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeview_%28UK%29), which is the major free-to-air television service in the UK. Any household with a TV aerial on their roof can receive most of those channels. Freeview is a digital television service.

[This page lists how the BBC spent licence fee revenue](http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/whoweare/licencefee/) between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011. It is broken down to show spending on TV, radio, online, research etc.

From April 2013 [funding from the licence fee](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19199114) will also go towards the Welsh-language television channel [S4C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S4C).

Generally I think most people in the UK are in favour of the BBC and the licence fee.

During the London 2012 Olympics the BBC ran [24 seperate live channels](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18922069) on the major satellite and cable tv services here so they could broadcast all the sports live as they happened.

By contrast, many sports such as Premier League football and Formula 1 motor racing are now broadcast on a pay per view basis on the major satellite television provider, [Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB). (Sky is the only place to watch all 19 F1 races live this year).

You inadvertently picked a bad day to ask this question, the subreddit is busy discussing the [death of Margaret Thatcher](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22067155), the UK's first female Prime Minister.

However the episode that hooked me was Dalek. It brought an enemy I heard a lot about, so I really was excited for it.  This episode is the first to really show the Doctor's dark side and I feel it's good for people so they know what to expect from the series.

For Tennant I would also suggest Family of Blood 1/2 because it is a real look at the Doctor's psyche and just how hard a life he's had.

Your basing your facts on the way you view terrorism though. Mandela created MK specifically as a militant group, it conducted bombings and his own autobiography stated MK would resort to ""guerilla warfare and terrorism"" if bombings didn't work. This is on his wikipedia page and even a basic review of his activities in '60/'61 would highlight this. 

&gt;  I still maintain that terrorist is a mere equivalent of insurgent, militant but it has so much sex-appeal for news corps or gvt propaganda. Terrorism is but a tool of many political entities that feel the need for illegal and murderous tactics to advance their agenda. There is no room for debate.

As I've said, terrorism is a tool used by insurgents, rebels, freedom fighters, cultists etc. It can be used for good, such as the actions of the French Resistance during WW2, or it can be used for bad such as the Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attacks. How you view terrorist activities is largely dependent on how you view the motives of the person or group conducting the activities.

Whole towns were literally decimated by the closing of the mines and a lot still haven't recovered.

Her government's worst policy wasn't the breaking up of the unions and the dismantling of the heavy industry - it was the way it was done. Most analysts would agree that it was inevitable it would happen. But it wasn't phased - it was done very fast. Whole towns and communities were thrown into poverty as there were few jobs, poor training and a complete lack of thought of the impact of the policy (or if it was considered it wasn't done with much intelligence or compassion). It should have been done over a much longer period to lessen the impact. More support should have been given. Much more.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"I'd agree with you re: Bent.  He excelled at counter-attacking teams because he had all the physical characteristics to match up against defenders 1vs1, and was a good enough finisher (when confident).  However, his movement was decidedly average and he couldn't cope with the step up in quality - and then once he lost confidence he was a dead duck.

Defoe's main deficiency is physical.  His movement is top-class but his lack of height means he struggles to stand out in a tight, crowded box and, though he has improved his strength dramatically, it's still not enough to create separation with top-class, physical defenders (a lot of his best work actually comes when matched against full-backs).  Additionally, his control is not reliable enough to be a factor when drop.

So, yeah, both strikers are perfect for counter-attacking teams and would have excelled at our club in the pre-Jol days, when teams were happier coming to White Hart Lane to attack.  Since then, Defoe's superior movement meant he has achieved success with us up until now.  However, as we have moved to a shorter passing game, Defoe's tendency to play on the last defensive shoulder is becoming more and more moot.  

Really, the best thing for Defoe would be for Huddlestone to find form and play more minutes: someone who can hit a more direct pass early into space before defenders get a chance to set themselves against Defoe's position.

Houses, food, medicine and infrastructure cannot appear via magic, the limiting factor of everyone having their desires realised is that there are finite resources.

What you seem to be so incapable of understanding is that if something can be achieved without ""cost"", then what's your problem? do it, implement it you don't need anything from the government.

Oh but you seem to think justifying expenditure of resources should be somehow assessed by ""feeling"" or ""intuition"" we have a special name for people like that ""crazy"", thinking somehow their priority overrides anyone else's, with no evidence to support any claim.

But I'm sure of course you would be perfectly happy to accept massive tax increase because someone thought ""I feel"" with no evidence to support it, that we need to X, and I'm sure you would not criticise if the supporting argument was simply ""I WANT THIS"" .

I like how you try and undermine evidence based reasoning, as if thats a bad thing, its actually a special tool necessary in what technically is called ""being fair"".

But of course I'm sure you would be happy in your taxes and support to be administered by people who don't believe in efficiency and maximising capability for cost.

And there is the problem. Canon isn't a subjective thing that each person can personally define, it has to be approved by a governing body (in this case the BBC). The BBC had never defined canon.

Star Trek does not have levels of canon, Paramount states that Film and TV episodes are canon, and nothing else is. This means Star Trek novels, comic book, and video games are not considered canon.

Star Wars does have many levels of canon, so maybe that is what you are thinking about. 

I also can believe that you think the new series is somehow higher in canon than the Classic Show.

true,heffalump232,null,null,"I have nothing against the concept of the trade union. It is right and just for a workforce to be represented as much as any manager or director, and a worker should not be treated as a cog which can easily be replaced. 

What I have a problem with is the trade unions who stand in the way of progress, and instead play a game of politics, with the ordinary workers acting as pawns in a game of chess with government and management, and also play the crusaders against a 'class war', a massive hindrance to the progress of society. In the 1970s and 1980s this was notorious; power cuts, rubbish mountains, unburied bodies, and for what? A power struggle with, of all the organisations, the Government. And who was going to win? 

I think it was wrong to completely annihilate heavy industry, but with figures like Arthur Scargill at the helm of unions, what could you do to allow modernisation of an industry to make it contribute to the wealth of the country? Would you propose open cast mining, or increase use of computers and machinery? Such proposals would have been outright rejected. It was stalemate. 

But it doesn't have to be this way; in Paris, they are making one of the Metro lines completely automatic, but the reason why there is little fuss is because unions and managers sat down at the first stages of proposal and negotiated to guarantee future employment to drivers; in Germany, union representatives sit on boards of directors. What about the Nissan factory in Sunderland even? What I'm trying to say is that co-operation with managers and board members is **the** way to make sure workers' voices are heard. With stand-offs pursued by the likes of Bob Crow (don't get me started on that man), it would be impossible to imagine the Paris Metro scenario with the London Underground. 

It is why I would love it if workers said 'Up yours!' to the old trade union blocs and form local trade unions, or to start again. It takes one group or individual to be the grown-up, to shake hands with former adversaries, to allow progress to take place; it may be baby steps, but you don't make giant leaps and bounds without alienating or irritating a large part of the population.

One hypothesis is that the orbit of Jupiter moved inwards, throwing off the balance of the solar system, flinging asteroids out of their stable orbit to cause impacts.  It's possible that Uranus and Neptune accreted late, and their new gravity wells affected Jupiter enough to cause the shift.

The Unions wanted a fair days pay for a fair days work. She had none of that. She wouldn't even negotiate. She didn't just get rid of the non-profiting companies, She got rid of all the manufacture infrastructure. She Privatized the Gas and Oil companies causing massive fuel inflation too. She Privatized the Railways, She allowed people to own their own council house, which effected inflation when she introduced Poll taxing again. The council houses also now null-and-void of their original intentions, to house people WHO NEED them *(Like the WW2 veterans)*.

That leaves open the option to move Lennon to the left side. I think he would be fine on that side as he does not look to shoot much, he more looks to dribble his way into the area and set someone else up to have shots on goal and I think he would be capable of this from either a left or right attacking mid position, again, because he has terrific pace, keeps his width and isn't concerned about getting onto one foot or the other to shoot with.

Rose also looks like a very dynamic player and could see him playing as a LB/LM/LW and being comfortable in any of the three.

But again the problem with considering Bale as moving inside for good is he takes the #10 spot and leaves Siggy and Holtby on the bench.

true,nascentt,null,null,"You asked an overly simplistic question that that really didn't warrant a great deal of intellectual debate.  But I'll answer it if you want.

Firstly, ""people that don't want to work"" is a weak phrase.  I am confident that many 'people that don't want to work' are mostly just not keen on jobs available to them.  
If they were offered decent salaries to watch pilot tv shows, beta test games. be astronauts, ferrari driving instructor's, pilot, drive go-karts or other jobs they might consider fun or 'not really work' then they'd snap at the chance.

What you're saying is that there are people that absolutely refuse and do not want to do anything that can be paid, at all, there is no profession on the planet, that you can be paid for, that they would want to do.

I think this is bullshit, honestly, I think many more people than you seem to give credit for would love to work if the opportunity and the right job came along.

The better question therefore would be, what is the point of having people working in jobs that do not satisfy or fulfil them.  Which is a valid and sensible question, and can be multi-faceted.  Often it is claimed that careers as they've existed prior to the digital age are slowly becoming redundant, as more and more jobs can be automated or replaced, so in that respect yes there are fewer jobs, and it's certainly harder to be accepted or to find a job that is enjoyable, but they still exist.  We've seen this in the industrial age, and we'll continue to see it in this one.

Now your plan of letting people that don't want to work lounge around at home, and let the others work is confusing.  While I enjoy working in my current job, and earning towards my future, the moment you now tell me that it's acceptable for me to need to pay a quarter of that money earned to people that 'dont want to work' you make me no longer want to work.

Why should I put in hours of time, and serving either consumers, or managers only for a chunk of my money to finance those that can't be bothered themselves?  You create a society of free-loaders.

I'd work hard to earn money to support my family or close friends struggling with bills, but for people that flat out don't want to do anything productive at all?

I agree the current state of 'employment' and jobs is a very awkward and strange time, as more and more careers are either invalidated or replaced by technology or outsourcing, but while a career is the only viable way of income, and money is needed to live in our society, I'm not quite sure where you think you're going with these points.  Are you saying you'd work to support the 5 houses next to you who can't be bothered?  I doubt it.  So then now there's 6 houses, will your neighbour then happily pay for you sacrificing the money he's earing, or could better be used on things that made our country worth living in, such as the nhs.

Your comment 'the cost to the taxpayer is the same' is quite confusing to me, taxes rise as money is needed, but taxes go toward things like joblessness and benefits, when they could be going to the healthcare, or education, or fire, police all of which are drastically being cut and damaged by our financial situation.",0,1365450064,null,0,1365491862,0,c9b2gq7,t3_1bul2b,t1_c9b2gq7,t1_c9b01hi,null,1431629132,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's very *mode du jour* to beat down on Thatcher now, but people (many here I guess) either never knew or have forgotten how fast this country was disappearing down the sh*thole to 2nd-world stagnation in 1979. ISTR one economist in the mid-1970s predicting that the Turkish economy would overtake the UK within a couple of years, and Turkey was significantly more backward then than it is now.

However, I'm pretty much certain you would have to pay capital gains tax (28%.. I think. see here: http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/cgt.htm ) on any PROFIT (made when you convert from bitcoin to GBP) above the capital gains threshold (which appears to be £10,600). Don't forget you should factor in any losses you may have made too as well as operating costs, etc.

So if you bought at 100 BTC at £10 and sold them at £100 you'd have £9000 profit and owe nothing (assuming this was your only profit in the financial year). If you'd bought 150 BTC at £10 and sold at £100 then you'd have £13500 in profit and owe tax on £2900 of it. If I'm right about the 28% rate, then you'd owe the taxman £812.

Obviously you'd need to have records to support the gains so if you'd mined them you might have a bit of a tricky time proving it. If you bought them it should be pretty easy to prove.

true,wolf156,null,null,"""She would have either gotten fired (and then gained a reputation of being ""difficult to work with"" ergo gotten even less jobs) or her role would have become even smaller.""  And that is the risk you take in acting. Christian Bale is known to be rough to work with, and yet he still gets parts. Katherine Heigl is notorious for being awful to work with and yet she still gets parts. 

Being ""tough to work with"" does not mean you wont get parts, nor does it mean your parts get smaller. 

The fact of the matter still remains: she should of been assertive. Even in the article she admits that towards the end. 

""If she had a Tardis, would she go back to 1963? “Oh God, yes,” she says, laughing heartily. “I’d make more demands. I’d be stronger. And do a few more high kicks!”""

She flat out admits she should of held her ground and if she had she may well have had the part she wanted. If she got fired, big deal, she moves on and takes other roles, but her career isn't ruined because she stood up for herself.

My point still remains here. Either Doctor Who was the make or break for her career and she wasn't assertive enough to hold her ground, or it was just another job for a paycheck like she said it was.

Either way the blame is still on her. It's not like she was singled out because it was 1963 and she was a young woman. Producers change entire characters or leave them out completely regardless of gender roles. It's what they feel the audience wants to see and as an actress if she has the talent, the motivation, and the drive to stand in that spotlight they aren't going to put her in the back. 

Talented actors get parts. Which is why some great actors can be in awful films and yet still get parts. George Clooney in Batman and Robin. Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy. Al Pacino in Jack and Jill. Sally Field on Gidget or as the Flying Nun, Anne Hathway on Get Real, or Helen Hunt in Pioneer Woman. They had awful roles in bad shows and movies and yet still have careers.

Join societies. There are quite a few, though the [society page](http://www.kentunion.co.uk/services/societies/) on the uni website is kind of a hit or miss because some are active and some aren't.

Overall, I had a blast. Dealing with the financial department was a nightmare that made me want to bash my head in, but the university and city are nice.

I kept thinking of him as guarded and closed off, which was a stark contrast to the other Doctors (maybe not so much 9). Sure he was quick to laugh here and there, but really he could have functioned perfectly fine without companions and that seemed to go against all we've learned from our Doctors to this point.

With Clara however, we now see that he's capable of getting occasionally flustered by someone other than River. Maybe that's meant to add to the ""Who IS she?"" intrigue, maybe the Doctor is allowing himself some hot pants, but I for one am happy to see it. 

PS - While I love the idea that Clara is Cal, that now seems a little too tidy and simple for Moffat's crazy jigsaw puzzle storylines.

true,TinplateMan,null,null,"In my mind, there are two sorts of unions, monopolistic and competitive. 

Monopolistic unions are like the RMT, who act in favour of ALL transport workers. Competitive unions generally only consist of the members of one company, or sometimes one area, or sometimes they can even have overlapping jurisdictions.

Just like monopolistic companies, monopolistic unions can cause trouble when they use their monopoly power to hold the rest of society to ransom. We see this all the time with tube drivers. I think that just like monopolistic companies, monopolistic unions should be heavily regulated. Some of them ought be regulated right out of existence, just as we have regulated monopolistic companies out of existence.

Competitive unions don't need to be regulated, because members of any union of workers which was known to be overly prone to disrupting society and industry would get hired less. Likewise, any union known by its potential members to NOT do enough to get them better pay, conditions, and training wouldn't get paid any dues. Bad unions would just slowly cease to exist. Good unions would constantly struggle to prove their worth to members and employers, which is ideal.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Mourinho does sign lots of players, he likes a big squad. But I think it's not entirely accurate to assume that Jose only succeeds when he is able to build an entire squad from the ground up. 

Here's a look at the most notable players (feel free to add to this if you like) brought to the club under Jose, excluding the summer before he left:

04-05: Robben, Ferreira, Alex, Drogba, Carvalho, Tiago

05-06: Essien, Ballack, Mikel, Kalou :)

06-07: A. Cole

While all of those players were extremely talented few were actually at or near the superstar level prior to coming here. Carvalho, Essien, Cole, Ballack were probably closest to that level at the time of purchase. 

There were still a lot of important players in the Mourinho era teams who came to prominence due to the guidance of Jose, and a bunch of those players were already here. Lampard, Terry, Duff, Cole, Gudjohnsen, Gallas, Cech and Makelele even.

You can find a similar history at Inter and Madrid. Mourinho usually wants to bring his own players to the table but he also tends to get the best out of any world class talent at his disposal. We now have a great deal of young players with tremendous potential. Jose will probably ask for a few types of players to suit his needs as well, but I don't believe he will need to replace a lot of the major players we have now in order to make us a top class squad. 

**TL;DR** With the squad we currently have, plus a few new guys to supplement them, Jose would undoubtedly do a fantastic job here, and there's no reason he can't achieve a similar success.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Poll Tax was actually a good idea. The ""Community Charge"". The problem with the old rates was that it was based on the value of your house. So high-value houses in areas with low population could raise quite a bit of cash.

However, low-value housing in high-density population areas could generate very little.  So a council with more rubbish to collect, and more kids to educate, could be on a lower budget than a rich area.  Think various London Boroughs, or inner-city areas.

The Community Charge said that you'd be charged per person in your household - *but* that the amount paid would be reduced according to means. I think the reductions would be compensated by central govt, but I'm not sure on that one.

In any case, it would mean that an area with 5 people to a house would get enough services to make it stop being such a shit area. There was no other way to get the money where it was needed, at a local level (and as populations shifted, so would the funds raised by taxes).

But by that time, Thatcher was so unpopular that when somebody branded it the ""Poll Tax"", there were riots.

She did some good things; the unions were too powerful. She did strengthen the economy. But she rode over everyone in her way, and took the attitude that those would *couldn't* work for what they got didn't deserve anything - even the help to be able to work for themselves.

&gt;the sell off of council owned housing   

To council tenants, a lot of working class people did very well out of it.  That and a lot of the housing was coming up for costly refurbishments or becoming costly to maintain.   Selling off wasn't so much a problem, it's that the housing stock wasn't replaced.

 &gt;the focusing on financial services at the expense of investment in industry

It wasn't really an either or.  Financial services could have their shackles taken off, but industry was given the freedom to succeed or fail.  The reinvention of London was a very positive thing, not just for bankers and brokers, the industry, the people and the country at large.

&gt;taking the coal industry to the knackers yard,

Half the mines were already in the knackers yard and were promising to take the profitable ones down with them, they'd knocked several bells out of the country in the 70s holding it to ransom, production was down, and we're still in the process of closing down coal power stations today even though they're producing electricity.  There was no future in it but breaking from it prematurely to create another dependable energy platform was a good thing for the country - bad for certain mining communities.

&gt;over reliance on the relatively short term potential on North sea oil

Don't let Alex Salmond catch you saying that.  He's practically built a campaign on it.

&gt;the poll tax

Fair one.  Bad policy for ~3 years.

&gt;an ideological sell off of nationalised industry  

Some of it was a good call. Some of it not so good.  Some nationalised services are justifiable, most nationalised industries are not.

&gt; Milk. Because that really was trivial, but was the first time she became nationally prominent.

Thatcher paved the way for financial domination of the economy. You cannot blame her for the actions of those within that industry. Despite the recessions we've seen, the rebalancing towards a monetary and consumer economy has contributed enormous benefits for this country and turned around decades of decline.

There are always people who hold opposing agendas. She understood that to succeed in transforming a vision into reality, you had to be ruthless and uncompromising in ideology.

So I will be just like those you describe - educated and made use of the UK infrastructure all my life, 3 years of which I paid tax, 26 years of which my parents paid tax; then take my skills and leave.   I won't be needing or wanting to make 48 hour trips to use the NHS,  I'd use the public system in NZ and top it up with private insurance like most people do.

I might be gone for a year or two, and basically come back and try to enter a training scheme at home, or I might try to do it here, which would mean living here for at least 7 years.  I might then come back and work as a Consultant in the UK, or stay in NZ, or go wherever I want to with my qualifications and skills.  

Your post is something I think about as well, it does feel a bit like I am turning my back on my country but should I feel compelled to stay here forever?

Is there a point in which it would be OK in your eyes for me to leave ?  2 years working in the UK will mean I probably pay around 12k in tax &amp; NI &amp; student loan repayment, as well as obviously putting my money back into the economy as I earn it.   

That might be entirety of what I pay in the UK if I don't come back (bar student loan and paying off a private loan I had to take out as well), or I might come back and be paying £40k a year in tax.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Did you even WATCH the game against Everton? He doesn't Mark. at all.

He just stands in space, and watches the game happen.

Moreover, replacing Parker with Huddlestone is like replacing Bale with BAE. Yeah, they both play in the same general area, but it's dumb. You'd replace Parker with JAKE, who's a much better positional defender. Parker's been slow this year, and he flat-out will not do what made Sandro so good for us the first half the year; break up the opposing possession early.

Seriously, go back and watch the Everton game, and count how many times he falls back in the face of attack, and then marks absolutely nobody while the rest of the team attempts to man-mark. It's astonishing. Against Basel, he and Gallas were marking Adebayor at the front post while Naughton had 2 at the back post, and 1 at the spot. Against Everton, his refusal to stick himself in for the ball directly lead to Mirallas's goal. Against Fulham, his lazy moving back gave up Berba's equalizer; Parker gives the ball away upfield, Fulham play it wide and break. As Parker walks back, 3 fulham players run past him into our box. Great work from your holding midfielder.

I'm not sure which games you're watching, because they're not the ones I've seen. Parker has been AWFUL the last month.

EDIT:
Watch [this](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xyt7qm_t1-2e-www-fasthighlights-com_sport#.UWM1X6t37Cg) and tell me Parker is in good form. he's jogging after Mirallas, after not going for the ball that gets passed to Mirallas.

It is important to not think of the Tardis as a vessel, but to think of the ship itself as a kind of set of clothing which enshrouds a being that is pan dimensional. That is to say, as the doctor is still linear in the sense that he has his own time line in which he cannot intefere, the TARDIS exists *within* time and space at the same time as it exists outside of it. 

The TARDIS herself is a being of the time vortex itself, and as such, can choose to present itself in all points in space and time at once - in such a capacity, the crack in the universe is the polar opposite of the TARDIS; it is an absence of time and causality - a manifestation of the void, if you will. Therefore, creating a big bang in the SOL system and releasing all of the energy of the time vortex would be somewhat akin to an immovable force meeting an unstoppable object; they would cancel each other out, and causality would ""right"" itself, snapping everything that has, will and could happen back into place, as opposed to happening all at once, in the way that the TARDIS sees them.

Parker's game plan; pass to whoever is in front of you. If you have a lane forward, run at it like a madman. Try to make a pass you can't, lose the ball, walk back on defense.

It wasn't Thatcher that coined the term - it's been going around since the Crimean War!  I believe it was Sweden after the UK, then Germany after reunification.

By the Winter of Discontent France, W Germany, Italy, Japan had overtaken the UK.  The recession hit us hardest.  We met them going down as they were coming up.  Sure the rest of the world met an oil spike in the 70s, the UK met it with strikes, inflation above the rest, and high unemployment.

true,aNOMymous,tardis,TARDIS,"I was only recently told this theory so I'll do my best to explain it as it was told to me :)

In episode s7e1 the Doctor gave Amy his bracelet to try and save her from becoming a dalek - he gave it to her without knowing if he, as a timelord, would still be safe.

In this episode we saw Amy lose herself in becoming more like a dalek, and seeing them more as the people they potentially were (the scene with people laughing, dancing etc).  she started to lose her emotions, her memories and her own sense of who she was.

what if Clara is important as she was (technically) a dalek at the time when the doctor was infected? is she there to remind the doctor of who he is?

what if he is starting to lose himself? he surrendered all his memories in The Rings freely - how did he know he wouldn't lose them entirely?
The Doctor is so old and so wise - he risked all he learned, everyone he's known and everything that got him there.

The idea is not that the Doctor will become a dalek but that he has been affected by them.  If he had been affected he could lose his memories, his knowledge of himself and end this series being called ""Doctor"" but asking ""Doctor who?""


----


For me the best idea out of this theory is the Doctor himself falling prey to ""The Question"", and the infection (so to speak) from the daleks is an interesting way to bring this about while tying s7 part one and two together.  

Perhaps the great intelligence will be involved... He could tell the Doctor who he is...

What consequences? That implies change occurred.

&gt; Amy's Choice had Amy choosing the Doctor and Rory, and she genuinely struggled with it.

Well, I'm sure we were *supposed* to think that. It didn't work for me, though, and there were no *consequences*.

&gt; Consequence number #2: Though it ended very poorly, pretty much all of Series 6 had the Doctor dealing with the actions he's done.

Ah, so your idea of ""consequences"" means ""rehash RTD's season 4 finale"". Well, sorry, but that's not *very* impressive.

&gt; This was handled briefly but quite well in Good Man, where he learns just how dangerous the mention of his name is, something that was also handled before in The Big Bang. 

Yeah, we've had several seasons of emo whinging about how dangerous the Doctor is.

&gt; I think Rory waiting 2000-freaking years was, although maybe a bit too much, definitely meant a lot for the couple's development.

Except, of course, he was a plastic man for most of that (and not much changed, to be honest) and didn't often act like it really counted.

And I didn't say there were no subsequent scenes. It just didn't change him from ""tagging along behind Amy"" which was his thing from the very first episode.

I suppose you could say that every scene ine very episode had ""consequences"" because there's always another scene.

&gt; but people think I believe Moffat is flawless. He's not. He's just very good. I dissent from the people who think that he is very, very good however

When it comes to single stand-alone episodes, he's easily one of the best writers that we've had in Doctor Who since the restart. I'm just unimpressed with his ability to do season-long arcs, yet alone multi-season arcs.

&gt;  there was never any choice, those two would stick together until the end, something that came to a nice scene in Angels Take Manhattan when Amy joined Rory on the edge of the roof.

Eh, that was nice, I'm sure, but aside from the fact that they *only* left because of real-world concerns from the actors and not because of actual plot issues, that's still no more or less of a ""consequence"" than ""Mickey moved on with his life, became an action hero who didn't pine over the girl but could laugh and admit that he used to"".",0,1365457455,null,0,false,0,c9b5fl4,t3_1bv3fg,t1_c9b5fl4,t1_c9ax0n1,null,1431627658,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

------------Adebayor----------

-----Sigurdsson----Holtby------

--Dembele-Huddlestone-Parker--

BAE-Vertonghen-Dawson-Walker

-------------Lloris-------------

Adebayor holds up play, Sigurdsson supports Adebayor, Holtby as an advanced playmaker and Parker to cover him if he loses possession, Huddlestone as deep lying playmaker to distribute to the fullbacks and to keep possession with the other midfielders around him, mostly Parker and Dembele who would help when defending which brings me to the topic of this thread.

Dembele is excellent at tackles, ball retention and dribbling past players. Now if you introduce a good passer like Huddlestone with him, he not only doesn't have to track back as much, but it relieves his need for running up the pitch to create play from the middle. He can run into the tackle then pass to Hudd who will blast it to someone on the counter, OR, what OP wants, he can stay up the pitch as Hudd or Parker have gotten the ball and can then make a run himself. The problem is not his position, but the fact that he does so much in midfield it can't be overlooked nearly as much as it has. That's probably why the guy keeps getting taken off so much, he's knackered!",0,1365462369,null,0,false,0,c9b794q,t3_1bxz87,t1_c9b794q,t3_1bxz87,null,1431626801,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2
