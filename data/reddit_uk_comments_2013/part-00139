With Cech and the developing Blackman on our books currently, we will definitely need to add another keeper during the transfer window. Cech will obviously be first choice for EPL &amp; CL matches but I'd prefer someone with a little more experience as our 2nd choice keeper.
Courtois is almost certainly going to be out on loan once again, so how about veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer? I also read that he wants to stay in London as his family are well settled there. Also will be retiring after the 2014 WC so it's a short term solution for one more year till we decide to bring Courtois back...

true,avidband,null,null,"Having watched no more than Marge vs. the Monorail https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ5CbLnSjo0 I feel I am qualified to suggest an alternative way of spending the money. First of all I would buy a fleet of 100 new buses (Last year in Leeds there were 4 bus company’s running I think Geldards, Centre bus, Arriva and First. While Geldards and Centre bus only had around 100 buses Arriva and First had 400 each roughly to give you an idea of the number of buses the city uses at the moment. The buses I’d buy would be super new modern eco buses with super wide doors for say £250,000 each would cost £25m then I would use £15m for 100 new bus stops along 60 miles of road with £10m spent of cycle routes £10m on special bike lock ups and £10m on making sure no one sleeps rough for more than one night. The Leeds outer ring road is 25, inner 2.5 and the A660 is 10 miles long to give you an idea of how much area you could cover.

The 100 new buses would be large electric buses with 2 sets of massive doors to allow everyone on and off at once saving time. Tickets would be brought at the bus station to board the bus to cut down on boarding times maybe. Anyhow all of that would cost £70m so with the left over £180m I think I’d run the thing for free for say 6 months (with a population of 620,000 you could give everybody £290, an annual travel pass with First costs £415 roughly so I’m sure you could get 6 months running out of the £180m). 

I found the bus numbers here https://sites.google.com/site/pacerchaser/, someone really loves buses.

true,vishbar,null,null,"I'm an American, but I've spent lots of time in the UK and my girlfriend is British. I'll be moving there soon, so...here are some tips.

Brits *love* it when Americans try to fake an English accent. In fact, most of the time they can't even tell you're a Yank! Bloody is a bit of a saucy word, but if you use it you'll complete the illusion.

The British do have some different words for things. ""Toilet"" is ""bog-a-log"", ""sink"" is ""basiloo"", bread is...well, just bread. A few others: an attractive/handsome person is a ""chav"", and ""chavvy"" is the adjective version. The British are quite direct, so it's best to speak fairly aggressively and loudly. When you meet her family, if you need to use the restroom, go up to her mother/grandmother/whatever and say ""Oi chav! Where's the bloody bog-a-log, then"" in  your best English accent. They'll love you for it!

Also, the British are quite like the Japanese in that they love showing the ""peace"" sign, except they do it backwards with the back of the hand facing out. They use it like ""thank you"", ""hello"", etc. So if someone helps you in a shop, catches your eye on the street, or you've just had a nice conversation, give them a big ol' peace sign.

The Brits don't see Americans too often, so they're sure to have questions for you! The English are sociable but sometimes need a bit of a prodding to start a friendship, so make sure to engage your neighbors in conversation when you're on a bus, train, or subway.

England is a small country, but it does have some pretty great towns like London, Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh. People from all over the UK are proud of their English heritage, so make sure you refer to anyone you meet as ""English"". England contains a few other provinces like Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but mostly everyone just considers themselves English. If you have English heritage, make sure to let them know! When they learn you're English too, you'll find lots of common ground for conversations.

As far as social customs go, they're fairly similar to us, but there are some differences. If you're wearing a hat (which you should be, the British are big hat-wearers) and hold the door open for a woman, it's traditional to take off your hat, bow, and say ""Any time a portal for you, my lass!"" You'll charm the pants off of anyone who you meet :). Remember to speak loudly, though!

Practice these simple rules, and you'll have a great British holiday. Good luck!

EDIT: How could I forget? There are a few other things you should know about. The Being Nice to People club is like England's version of the Boy Scouts, but for adults! You should definitely wear some of their stuff around, it'll give off a really positive vibe. And do you enjoy cutting a rug? Then I'd highly suggest going to some Extreme Dancing Lessons! Look for their meetups online; the main guy, Tommy, is amazing!

The Ponds? They're in New York. And it's dumb - ""I can't go back to 1938!"" What? Why? He solves harder problems than this literally every week! Plus, couldn't he... I dunno... go back and pick them up in 1939? I know they'd be cross after waiting a year, but they're still alive! They lived to old age! Or, what about going to New Jersey and catching a ferry to New York. I mean, I know it's New Jersey and all, but come on! Or, if he can't go to New York, go to Kansas City, and mail them a postcard, asking them to catch a train! Hell, go to London and send them a telegram; tell them to take a Zeppelin!

So, in my opinion, The Angels Take Manhattan was silly and a completely ineffectual way to say good bye to the Ponds - they're alive; it's an easily solvable problem; and yet, he's supposed to be so inconsolable and broken up about it that it's ""completed"" his character arc transformation?

If you remove the outliers like the handful of idiots that answered that over 90% of the population is Black or Asian then the answers are considerably more accurate than indicated.

For example by far the largest section (24%) of those asked got the number of Muslims in the UK correct (1-10%) while a small number (5%) said that between 50-80% of the population is Muslim. If you just looked at those people and disregard the other options for a second then the obvious conclusion is that the overwhelming majority got the answer correct but if you take the mean then you can conclude that the average person thinks that 15% of the population is Muslim, about 3 times the actual number.

Given that this survey is titled ""The Perils of Perception"" I find it pretty hard to conclude anything other than that they deliberately designed this survey to get the result that the public are wildly misinformed.

Edit: There's a bunch of other things also. For example activities people considered benefit fraud include:

People on unemployment benefit not trying to find work (46%)

People from abroad/immigrants claiming benefits (34%)

People having more children so that they are entitled to more benefits (32%)

By ""resources"" I mean ""stuff"" the stuff in the environment that we need in order to live. Everything you need and want originates from somewhere on the planet. Our computers started off being dug out of the ground as raw materials, your toast was grown in a field, your newspaper was chopped down in a forest somewhere etc. 

For thousands of years humans all shared the resources that are here but something happened and certain groups of humans seized ownership of those resources and denied the rest of the humans their share unless they became their bitches. 

The royal family is a symbol of this extremely unfair and, personally, nauseating, aspect of human evolution. They don't have the power they once had, it is the billionaires now who's bitches we are. But any commoner defending the royals' status is a turkey advocating Xmas.

Castle Mill is nearer to the train station, and to Jericho, which has some great cafes and restaurants. It's also right by Port Meadows, which again gives you your green space.

A improvements are unnecessary. B company is American construction company. America 'lend Saudi Arabia' the money to do the construction, which goes to B company.

3) Start a program to expand the tunnels to allow for multiple tracks per line to allow for 24 hour running

4) Have dedicated express trains between major routing points on the network

5) Increase the size of the congestion charge zone and remove the exclusion for electric vehicles

6) Build dedicated coach parking in tourist areas in central London so they don't break the traffic flow or ban coaches and have them go to points outside the M25 and have fast cheap train access in.

7) Restrict heavy goods vehicles to night time operation where possible

8) Implement segregated cycle lanes

9) Loosen the restrictions on black cabs as GPS is ubiquitous. Not get rid of the knowledge just reduce the scope to make it easier to have more black cabs.

He might find the phenomena interesting (likely wouldn't care), but unless it's somehow relevant to solving a case, he would note it, and if it bothered him, he would ask about it.  He would then accept the explanation, and deeming it irrelevant to a case, promptly try to forget it.

Case in Point:

&gt;“That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth traveled round the sun appeared to me to be such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.


&gt;‘You appear to be astonished,’ he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. ‘Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.’


&gt;‘To forget it!’


&gt;‘You see,’ he explained, ‘I consider that a man’s brain is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.’


&gt;‘But the Solar System!’ I protested.


&gt;‘What the deuce is it to me?’ he interrupted impatiently: ‘you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”

I would redesign road junctions so that pavements continue across them.  No more waiting at the kerb for pedestrians, you can just walk across - it will be the vehicles on the road who give way to you, not the other way around.  I would also reduce or eliminate the huge, sweeping curves found at some junctions.  This would force traffic to slow down when turning off the road, making the road safer for everyone.

Those are terrible, morally bankrupt options. So the load will *have* to fall on those who can still work, or who do not need their pensions.

In order to preserve some kind of social contract, I think we need to be realistic about the pensions we will be able to provide. The pattern in life expectancy has been apparent for decades to anyone paying attention. The age profile of our population is similarly readily available. There's no good excuse for us getting to this point, but we still have to solve it now.

So I think everyone currently working (save maybe those already over about 63) will have just have to work longer. If we mover the state pension age up to something like 70 - over time - then the pension itself is still credible to the young, and actually available to the old.

The Government has two options to sell the loan book:

* It can either remove the interest cap as in the USA and betray students, and destroy the ability of most to afford University.
* Or they can guarantee buyers a minimum income when interest rates are low (as now). Basically the Government would pay buyers to buy the loan book.

What would they gain? A few billion pounds in a one time payment. This doesn't reduce the deficit, and it's a drop in the ocean in the actual debt. All this sell off does is remove a source of income that only a Government can take advantage of. This is because Governments can borrow at low enough rates to make a profit of the low rate students pay.

This is as bad a move as when Gordon Brown sold of the gold reserves. Except imagine that when he did the gold wasn't just sitting there, it was actively making the Treasury money.

Under Mourinho we were defensive, counter attackers, waiting, not pass the ball around, make it look beautiful and be a showman stylish football. The Champions League we won was one of the best displays of counter attacking, defending and sheer grit and determination (something easily associated with Brits I might add). What you deem as showy is clearly when you're dealing with monetary terms. Showmanship is not the same as wealth. We might be very wealthy but we bought Mata, Oscar, not Neymar. Ok so now with these players we're edging towards the passing showmanship domination but we also don't do the humiliate your opponents with skills thing either.

You're right about the D&amp;G for 3 seasons, but we did have Armani before them and you're probably right about the renewal. I also understand your view entirely but I believe Hackett is a smart choice, if not to everybody's taste.

However in terms of suiting I have to disagree. In terms of middle class men's suiting in Britain; Hackett is still well renowned and valued. It wasn't around 3-4 years ago. Much like our reputation, Hackett is enjoying a resurgence under their new leadership. Chelsea have not until relatively recently tried to play beautiful football or be very ""fashionable"". Hackett is now being deemed fashionable (I'm not talking about your average bloke on the street but more your suit aficionado pseudo-hipster), perhaps more so than D&amp;G and Armani because of their nouveau riche connections (admittedly that's a connection one could argue but hardly one I think we'd want associated with us). Many people who aspire (yes I'm generalising) to own a D&amp;G suit and Armani flashy suits are less conservative and classy one might say. If that's the direction Chelsea wishes to go in I don't disagree. I also believe that an as a British club we should be essentially British in Brand. I'd love it if our flight sponsors were BA rather than Delta, Delta who basically only operate in the US?

Hackett being desperate to get a foot in? Yeah I'd agree with the principle but not necessarily the diction you've used, it isn't so much as them forcing themselves in as a logical progression in the resurgence.

So do I see this suiting agreement as a step down? No, it seems like more of an opportunity to help grow parallel brands adding sophistication to otherwise polluted and populist market. This seems more equal, more British and more suave. Internationally Hackett is growing, as is Chelsea.

Also Britishness ought to sell fairly well to American markets given the close affinity of cultures and given that Chelsea's main market at the moment I don't see it as much of a hinderance. Possibly to the Asian markets but then their purchasing power of specifically suits is probably slightly lower.

Whilst recruiting for IT graduates I've found that there are two kinds of crap: 

1) Skills are crap. The graduate has finished but isn't able to apply what they learnt in the 'real world'. Many interviews for graduates include technical exercises to show that they do understand what is being asked of them and frankly - sometimes - I get the impression that no preparation was done. 

2) Attitude is crap. This is far more common... some graduates don't know how to operate in the business world and are generally disinterested, mono-syllabic, uncommitted and lacking integrity to what is being asked of them (which could be anything from making a simple phone call to attending an interview). I've had graduates pull out of interviews and not bother to phone to say they weren't attending... others who committed to making a phone call and then didn't bother / remember...

...and at the risk of ranting, this really reflects badly on them for the future. *I* might be a lowly recruiter, trying to help them find employment, but not attending interviews wastes the time of other professionals all the way up to Head-of-business levels and that's not cool. 

That's probably the most frustrating thing I encounter, working with graduates.

That's fairness, or even ""correctness"".

Completely different from _political_ correctness, which is a very different thing, and is in many ways simply racism expressed in a different way.

Let me give you an example: my mother used to be a registered child minder.  At first you were left to yourself as a childminder.  Then the local councils started inspecting.  My mum at the time was looking after white children only (by chance, not choice).  The inspector asked her what she fed them, ""yogurts, some fruit, eggs, mince occasionally, whatever the child likes really"", essentially stuff that my mum fed her children.  The inspector told her that she needed to vary the food more.  ""What do you mean?"", ""You need to widen their cultural experience"".  ""Like what?"".  ""You should make curry occasionally"".  ""Why?"" ""Because that's what other cultures eat"".

This is from the politically correct department.  ""Brown people eat curry"" is essentially what this tosser thought.  Racism disguised as political correctness.

In order to think that a minority needs special treatment, you have to believe that that minority is implicitly inferior to the majority.

A straight-up goalscorer, untried in a major league, but young (24) and with ridiculous scoring stats in Austria.

Still only 26, and has good scoring stats in a poor Reading team.

Injuries are a concern, but it's possible he won't get many games at Chelsea this season.

&gt; Papiss Demba Cissé

Might not be massively expensive, and if he goes on another run of form, could bang in quite a few goals with our beast of a midfield behind him.

&gt; Rickie Lambert

As a one-season stopgap, of course. But he's a damn fine goalscorer, can play up front alone, and CAN SCORE PENALTIES. Which would be useful if we ever got any.

Davies certainly planted seeds for his major plotlines, but it always felt like they were the smallest of hints towards the largest events, and they were only ever plotline hints for a single season. Moffat has set up plotlines, that he certainly seemed to have enacted (and has) seasons ahead of events. They do both have issues wrapping up, though. I mean, I honestly hated the end to season 3, loved The Master, loved Captain Jack being a part of it, just hated the very ending. Season 4, well, we all know the issues there. Season 2's ending was fairly good, and damn was it sad, and then there was season 1, which was easily one of the absolute worst, and, frankly, most poorly explained, examples of deus ex machina in the series. 

Personally, I loved the reboot of the universe in the pandorica, I loved all of that. I agree it was silly, but I enjoyed its silliness, and I think it had a lot of charm. Season 6's ending was similar for me, deus ex machina, but in a way I found much more charming than Davies. 

I basically feel like, for the most part, I preffer Moffat's style, which has much more emphasis on the emotional development of the character's, draws much, much more attention to the arc of the season/series, and I think he plans further ahead.

Season 6 finale was just, for lack of a better description, a cluster fuck. 

Davies had a lot better emotional pay off for characters IMO, as I've said elsewhere Moffat can't develop characters, especially female ones. He merely tells us how they develop but they're never written differently (For example, Amy waits for a man for 20 years, decides she doesn't want him, wants another man, see's him die multiple times, marries him, has a child with him, looses that child, discovers she's infertile, divorces him and re-marries him. Yet, Eleventh Hour and Angels in Manhattan? Same character. What?) Same with The Doctor, he doesn't let the story tell itself, he has to tell it. Vastra/Jenny/Strax have to tell us that he's depressed in The Snowmen, yet when he turns up he's all happy go lucky as normal. 

I'm fine with more attention to the arcs, but not to the point that they ruin what could have been a much better story (Time Of Angels).

The west lothian problem creates a serious inequality. However the government of England for most purposes IS the government of the UK. Spending on massive issues such as health, education, housing: these are massive issues that affect the entire nation both economically and socially in a vast range of ways.


Yes Scotland has less of a stake in health spending in England and Wales. But when you are talking about a third of the UKs budget being spent, AND around 4% of GDP being sloshed into the economy, it is insane to suggest they have no stake.


If we were talking about federalism in the UK, with each region getting their own say that would be a different matter. But this is allowing one single massive entity to get to direct its own path, with the smaller partners being swept along in its wake.

One of the problems with transport at the minute is that during peak hours the buses are already full, are having to stop every few hundred yards, and still get bogged down in traffic when the roads are too narrow for bus lanes.

If the model support this, the bulk of the money would be spent creating a high capacity rail system across the city, using existing and reopened lines, with short stretches of new line to high traffic locations if these would boost usage significantly. This would cater for people wanting to get into the city centre from the outskirts or across the city quickly and in peak times.

Bus routes and times would be redesigned to cater for exchange traffic, as well as being better optimised for where and when people want to travel. Along with this an oyster card style system would be adopted to make switching between modes of transport easier, and park and ride facilities would be expanded.

I wouldn't fund phase two from the £250 million. This would involve improvements to the roads for non-motorists which could have a negative impact for motorists.

I realize, that's a lot of favourites, but they are all rather different. I have overall preffered Davies Seasons, but because they tend to be speckled with Moffat episodes. My favourites individual episodes are mostly Moffat.

I had a problem with the end to season 1, because, built up or not, the odds were impossible, there was a giant dalek fleet, and the Doctor himself couldn't do anything. So, the story required rose to somehow be able to break open using normal technology (something you would not expect to work on a tardis), then Rose becomes instantly as powerful as a good, brings Jack back to life, kills all of the daleks, spreads ""bad wolf"" through the universe, and yet, the only things she fixes are things directly correlating to that one event, despite ""seeing everything"". It just seems a bit too plot convenient.

Again, I fully acknowledge Moffat's endings are cop outs, but I guess I just enjoy them regardless. I assume he gets rory able to open the pandorica with one buzz of the sonic screwdriver, because once the pandorica opened the first time, it was not expected that it would ever be seen by the doctor again, thus making the security less secure, and since the doctor got out, he could program the screwdriver to work as he saw how the pandorica opened, but that's totally grasping at straws. Again, I acknowledge moffat's endings to be somewhat poor, but I find them more charming and rewarding than Davies, but that's just me personally. I agree Moffat isn't always great at character development, but I don't think it stays a hundred percent, bluntly the same. I think, particularly with Rory, changes happened over time. I also think that Clara, just in the few episodes she's had so far, has shown change and improvement.",0,1373459217,null,0,false,0,caznca7,t3_1hzbdd,t1_caznca7,t1_cazn5uk,null,1430519683,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The odds were impossible, but The Doctor could do something, he had the delta wave, he just chose not to use it.

That's referenced in Utopia 'Everything she did was so human' which I took to mean that she just focused on what was going on rather than repairing the whole of time and space. 

I've always found Davies to be more rewarding, they actually had value for the characters, Rose got stranded, Martha got so scarred she left and Donna lost everything she had become.

I am more inclined to believe this version, posted in another forum.

-----------------------------------------

Hello! I am a Croatian, and just wanted to say something. Yeah the deal with you is probably off. Halilovic family have agreed that its not time for him to leave, and it is the best decision they could make for the kid. Why? First of all Alens father is a coach and know what is best for his son. He knows that he can make the big transfer after few years aswell. But he is not ready for you now, not phisically on the level, has to and raise every aspect of his game to be on the level.

Tottenham doesnt give opportunity for such young kids (probably this would change with Boas but still..) and he would probably go on the loan which i think he would dislike. If one Dos santos didnt get full chance, and Halilovic is similar to him but at the moment not good as him, and offcourse he wouldnt play instead of Lennon, or on the Amc you have Dempsey? 

Also it would be very stupid that he signed for you now and stayed a year in dinamo, not good idea, he would not get the best and proper treatment and nursioning in the club probably, cause we would now he is leaving. and he would not have his head straight.

So, yeah, this is what it is for know. Believe be it is better for both sides. He just most stay and develop in Dinamo for atleast 2 more years and than he will be ready. All i know, is that he would probably going after a while to Prem league (Spurs, Arsenal), or Italian sides (Inter, Juve, Milan), so you have to keep your eye on him, or you will probably sign or make an agreement that Spurs would have better start position in his future transfer. 

Cause when he develops he has brighter future than Modric, he can play on the right wing or Amc better, and Tottenham is perfect club for him in the future. Cheers.",0,1373460127,null,0,false,0,cazniy4,t3_1i04ys,t1_cazniy4,t3_1i04ys,null,1430519596,20,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,20

If house prices go down, people will be forced to default, and then the government will incur massive debts. So this is essentially a guarantee that house prices will never go down, because any future government will come into power with pre-existing liabilities in the housing market. Here's an idea of the degree of criticism this has got from finance:

* Though the government’s stated intention is to “make the aspiration of home ownership a reality for as many households as possible”, the actual effect could be to inflate house prices and put home ownership even further out of reach for renters, the IMF said. [[1](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64bdfe24-c309-11e2-9bcb-00144feab7de.html)]

* Sir Mervyn King (at the time Governor of the BOE) said: ""We do not want what the US has, which is a government-guaranteed mortgage market, and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position."" [[2](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/10074452/IMF-warns-on-dangers-of-Help-to-Buy-mortgage-scheme.html)]

* Fathom Consulting, a forecasting firm run by former Bank of England economists, has called the scheme ""reckless"" and that it risked creating a new housing bubble that could push the average UK house price to £300,000 by the end of 2015, up from the current level of around £240,000 [[2](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/10074452/IMF-warns-on-dangers-of-Help-to-Buy-mortgage-scheme.html)]

* Albert Edwards, economist at Société Générale: **“I believe it truly is a moronic policy that stands head and shoulders above most of the stupid economic policies I have seen implemented during my 30 years in this business,”** Edwards says. “It ranks above some of Alan Greenspan’s very worst blunders. And when so many highly regarded commentators speak out against it, only to be totally ignored by George ‘I know better’ Osborne, he may really deserve to be called a moron.” [[3](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/london-briefing-osborne-savaged-over-moronic-help-to-buy-scheme-1.1416951)]

Unfortunately, this is what happens when young people disengage from politics, you get 'technical measures' like this which cause serious damage to our futures. If that house price increase is accurate, you may well have to work five years longer before you pay off your mortgage, and a major section of your life will go by the wayside.

I'm not sure where you get that idea.

There were a considerable number of reasons a coalition was unviable. For the most part that it didn't have a majority of votes, and would have relied on a melange of Green/Irish party/SNP votes. The other being that the Labour party was completely unprepared for the coalition negotiations, and the there was no real will on the part of the Liberal Democrat leadership to work with the Brown leadership.

But the issue of reliance on Scottish seats never even arose. I'm unsure where you came across that sentiment. As someone who was working for a member of the current shadow cabinet at the time I never encountered it.

We've had lib/lab pacts/lab-SNP pacts/Lab governments that relied on Scottish votes to survive several times in the past. 

I personally don't think the English population would care outside of the comments section of certain tabloids. Voters are, generally, utterly unmoved by constitutional issues, when they are aware of them.

I remember discussing this problem with various party members (then again, I do live in Scotland).

&gt;We've had lib/lab pacts/lab-SNP pacts/Lab governments that relied on Scottish votes to survive several times in the past. 

Most of which took place prior to devolution (... well, let's ignore NI as they have a much reduced number of MPs) and the cases which took place after (say a majority of English MPs against tuition fees or foundation hospitals), are brought up whenever devolution is mentioned. 

&gt;I personally don't think the English population would care. Voters are, generally, utterly unmoved by constitutional issues, when they are aware of them.

In a hypothetical other universe, I think the approach that Labour and Lib Dem would have taken on the cuts would have made them unpopular, UKIP and Conservatives would have had a field day for every issue foisted on English voters that there was a majority of MPs for England against. 

&gt;The fact that a victorious 2015 Labour government will need only 34% of the vote is a FAR greater threat to legitimacy in the eyes of the public. But they won't care. Particularly not the 34% Labour needs to win to get hold power.

I mean, I'm not black, but at my primary school, a Church of England primary school, there were a family of indian children, and a black lad, in my high school there were 1-2. Hardly common by any means, but I never saw anyone mention skin colour.

I went to college in Leeds instead of going to 6th form, and there were a number of black people on my course, we all got on just fine. The only time I've ever been accused of racism, I was in a McDonalds in Leeds with my food tray, looking for a place to sit, it was pretty full and there was just those tall stools, but behind me were two old ladies at a table, I initially sat on one of the stools, then noticed them and asked if they minded me sitting there. Primarily because the stools are not comfortable to sit and have a meal. There was a guy standing about half a metre from me biting his nails, I barely took notice of him, I just wanted to eat in comfort. The moment I sat at the table with the old ladies he started the verbal abuse. I hadn't even realised the guy was black, until he started judging me. I should point out that the old ladies were in the queue next to me and I let them go first - the layout of that McDonalds is a mess and doesn't lend itself to organised queueing at all.

So my only racist experience was someone accusing me of racism simply because I wanted to move seats to somewhere more comfortable. I mean, a backless stool, I can't just lean back into the seat, and, frankly, I like doing that. But of course, a 19year old white lad would never ask to sit with a pair of old ladies, must be racism.

Even after I tried explaining this to him, he was still trying to inform me of my closed minded view and that I shouldn't be judging people based upon their skin colour. ",0,1373461495,null,0,false,0,cazntp5,t3_1hztv0,t1_cazntp5,t1_cazmf70,null,1430519456,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Indeed, on the way in (as its mostly downhill) it takes me about 2 minutes less than it would on the tube if I am really gunning it.  However when you consider that is door to door time, and sometimes you have to wait 5 minutes for the tube, it is definitely faster.

Going back, took me a while to get it faster, about 1 year later I'd shaved 15 min off my time.

So now I comfortably beat the tube, but sometimes I'll do some laps around Hampstead if I've time to kill.

The difference between cycling in London and the Netherlands is massive thou.  Priority is given to bicycles, not to car.  Think a small B road which is just about 1 lane in each direction in the the UK, in the Netherlands is often a single lane (ie no dotted white line) with two cycle lanes either side.

This change of attitude just makes things much safer.  You don't need to completely separate cycling from other road users, but it is often easier to put a cycle path in a place you couldn't fit a road (ie between building across parks etc).

The other nice thing that I always love about cycling in Netherlands / North of Belgium is they often put the cycle lanes in the middle of the road.  I've been nocked off twice by people attempting to turn across traffic that is stationary, they don't check the bus lane or allow enough time for them to be able to see in to it.  Having the vulnerable users in the middle prevents this problem!",0,1373462251,null,0,false,0,cazo053,t3_1i03h8,t1_cazo053,t1_caznwf1,null,1430519371,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

More importantly we saw across the board decreases in 'benefits in kind' which impacted the rich more than the poor.

What the report doesn't show, but alludes to, is that the top quintile had a net decrease in salary in 2011/12, whereas the other quintiles were flatish.

I don't really understand what your point is. If you are implying that common-place racism doesn't exist because you (as a *white guy*) haven't seen much of it, well, in the same theme of personal experinces, obviously mine go against yours. So it all kinda cancels each other out.
I'd be more inclided to ask a black/asian person what they thought, because obviously, they are the ones that it happens to. A (black) guy at a place I used to work at I feel explained it best when he told me that he still feels that people judge him on the colour of his skin, they just won't outright come and say it. They see him as lower than them, or different from them, and they act like it.    
Now, I'd even say that the guy in your story is indiciative of racism in this country. If that guy hadn't been exposed to racism in the past, would he automatically have assumed that your (accidental) snub was racist? I doubt it. He might have just thought you were rude. Instead, probably because of things that have happened to him in the past, he assumed racism.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;The difficulty of pushing legislation through the Commons on English issues if a Lib-Lb coalition that was dependent on Scottish votes was mentioned in the news (the rolling coverage when Nick Clegg was going round and talking to everyone). I remember discussing this problem with various party members (then again, I do live in Scotland).

Well I must confess being it the Westminster bubble at the time I didn't really encounter it as an issue.

There were so many reasons the rainbow coalition was totally unworkable. A possible future question of legitimacy from the tory press on a constitutional issue didn't really break into the top ten.

&gt;UKIP and Conservatives would have had a field day for every issue foisted on English voters that there was a majority of MPs for England against.

I agree they would have had a field day in the press. I don't think the issue would have had much ressonance with voters, particularly the Labour and Lib Dem voters they would have been looking to steal. 

Moreover it would have been the least of their ammunition. This would have been an unpopular Labour government, which the population had booted out of power after 13 years, clinging into office for another 5, while having to make extremely unpopular decisions.

I don't think a poorly understood constitutional issue would be particularly big beer in that hypothetical government's problems.

&gt;let's ignore NI as they have a much reduced number of MPs) and the cases which took place after 

But should we? The Callaghan government absolutely relied on Irish votes on a number of key divisions on domestic issues which had no effect in NI, defeat of which would have probably meant the collapse of the government.

This was at a particularly tense time when the opposition was doing everything they could to bring down the government. Yet the issue of legitimacy was not raised in the face of the unusual devolved government situation in NI at the time (governed separately, but from London, with minimal input from westminster votes).",0,1373462802,null,0,1373463283,0,cazo569,t3_1hzum5,t1_cazo569,t1_caznrl6,null,1430519306,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

When i look at him now i think he is a guy that is low/mid table calibre, but he is only 20 so he could develop into something more.  He doesn't strike me at the moment as a top 4/5 team striker.

I would like to see him out on loan to one of the lower half clubs for this season to see if he play in the PL, i just have concerns if there is a team out there that will know what to do with him.",0,1373464298,null,0,false,0,cazojr8,t3_1i08iq,t1_cazojr8,t3_1i08iq,null,1430519114,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Coates and Skrtel haven't had any sort of transfer involvement (bar a brief mention of Napoli) and it seems pointless to bring in new CB's unless we're certain they're leaving. I'm a fan Ilori in for Coates if Seb really wants to go but I also like Skrtel staying and battling with Toure for the spot at the back with Agger. We're a team with big changes going on, why not keep the core of the team stable?

I really don't understand you thinking we need another star player to pair with Sturridge and Suarez. We struggled to fit Suarez, Coutinho, Sturridge, Borini and Downing into our front three last year, and since then Sterling's come back and we've added Aspas and Alberto.

I can't the point of selling Suarez then spending the majority of the money, around £30m, on another player (Higuain/Benteke/Jovetic) because they won't be as good as Luis and the only reason they'd join us over the bigger clubs interested is because we'd guarantee games. I don't think we could do that without stifling the development of others, especially without any European games to stretch the season.

Our new signings have given us more depth across the attacking line but I can see us adding another Striker/Winger if we lose Suarez *and* Downing.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;What type of player is Kane, how is he best utilized?

Kane can hold the ball up well and has the ability to tuck away the odd shot with his right or get on the end of the cross. Unfortunately, for every goal he scores there seems to be 2-3 howling misses, so he is best playing as an assistant so he can pull strikers away or set up another striker.

If I had to build an offence around Kane it would probably look something like a 4-4-1-1 with creative midfielders. 

&gt;Does Kane have a future at the club?

Probably not. He is a decent championship player and at his current progression will be a low level PL player by the end of the season. But granted his potential and odd position he probably won't make it beyond a mid table striker. I think he is a (very) poor mans Michu, height and some skill but best utilized with a real striker in front of him (hence why they got Bony). If there is a team somewhere between Palace and Fulham (on the table, not the map) implementing a system that can accommodate him I think he would best be suited moving there on a permanent.

&gt;What should happen with Kane this season and in the future?

As I mentioned above. His style and ability probably block him from having a future at spurs.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Firstly, kudos on a detailed reply. Chelsea has been a fashionable club for a long time. The 60s and 70s were the initial period of Chelsea being the 'it' club in football with the Kings Road scene helping greatly. While the 80s brought it's own problems, during the resurgence in the mid 90s we were still the fashionable place to be thanks to the Continental imports. The 'European' influence was on display with the cars, clothes and lifestyles of our players and we did once again become the trendy, showy club. A lot of the brashness came around after the Abramobovich takeover, in the very first game we played Liverpool and a lot of our fans were waving money at them, a few burning notes. The burning didn't stick but plenty of opposition fans were greeted with waving wads of notes. Mourinho is arguably the definition of brashness, a lot of his personality rubbed off on the fans and the way we were perceived as a club. We're also the poster child of the nouveau riche football clubs, a change in perceptions over the past year or two can't completely change what was shaped by the past few decades

With regards to the Asian market, it's probably many times the size of the American market. While the elite fashion houses are common in the big cities of the US, the amount of things being purchased is tiny in comparison to Asian cities. Throughout Japan, China, Thailand, India and more, people are falling over themselves to acquire these European luxury brands at a large markup. In a pinch once, I needed to buy a tie in Shanghai for a night out so I popped in to the closest Prada store, it was around three times the price I would pay in the UK thanks to import taxes. Point being, the recognisable and popular D&amp;G affiliation would be much more useful in the world's biggest luxury goods market

Delta is a shit airline, thankfully I haven't flown them for years. BA is in rapid decline and as someone who grew up travelling on Concorde and taking pride in how BA was a world leader in aviation, it's sad to see how far they have fallen. Club World is bettered by a dozen airlines' Business Class and the 'New First' product is laughably poor in comparison to Asian, Middle Eastern airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss, Qantas and even the new First product on American Airlines. We could have done better, but Delta wanted to capitalise on their expanding operations out of Heathrow and it made sense. I'd much rather take American away from Fulham. Cannot see BA sponsoring a British club, they would most likely stay neutral on anything divisive

Burberry would have been good, perhaps even a Paul Smith or Alexander McQueen

Ade can be great when he wants, he can also be a mopey donkey when he doesn't feel like playing.  Last season it seemed like we had more of the mopey donkey than the quality player.

As their dealings had been entirely cordial to that point none of the guards objected.

The inquest had to rely on the recollections of the guards about what happened on his return because no-one else witnessed what triggered the unfolding events.

After being asked to retake his seat, a struggle ensued after Mr Mubenga allegedly shouted out ""I'm not going to go!"" and lunged at one of them.

Mr Mubenga was wrestled back into his seat and they handcuffed him, with his hands behind his back, as other passengers looked on.""

&gt;What is ultimately leaving me exiled is the extension of the probationary period.

His main complaint is that he has to wait 5 years (or whatever) for his wife to become naturalised British, so they can get NHS money for her training.

I would think that actually, the point of those programs is to train *British* people for those jobs. That is why his wife would have to wait the probationary period (the period required to become a British citizen) before being able to get the funding.

I am no expert on NHS midwife bursaries. We would need more information to know if they have to stay in the UK for so many years to work or something. I base my assumption on ""home student"" fees for universities, where you have to live in the UK permanently for at least 3 years to be a ""home student"", even if you are already a British passport holder. There is, of course, no requirement for a ""home student"" to work in the UK after graduation.

All that said, it seems that you got the impression that I am somehow *for* tighter immigration requirements. I'm really not. I also stand to be inconvenienced a lot thanks to these rules. I think they cause more harm than good for many people.

My beef with this article is that this particular author is really exaggerating his misfortune. He can almost certainly afford to make the move to the UK if his family really wants to. He may have to be apart for a few months, his wife may not get the perfect job for a few years. But this is all part and parcel of moving your family between countries.

When contemplating such a move, you have to make sacrifices, both short term and long term. My family split in half for over 3 years because of ""home student"" requirements. But we planned ahead and made it work. He shouldn't expect to be able to just waltz in to the UK and everything will just fall straight into place, with a new house, great jobs for him and his wife and a fantastic school for his kids.

There are parents out there in the UK, torn from their families, desperately trying to make enough money to send home to the wife and kids, possibly living in appalling conditions. Those people are the reason why the immigration policy is bad. The author is trying to paint himself as such a hapless victim, he has no idea how good he has it! He sounds like a spoilt child, complaining that he can't go on the school skiing trip, while other people can't even afford to go to school.",0,1373469686,null,0,false,0,cazqbmn,t3_1hxatq,t1_cazqbmn,t1_caz150p,null,1430518278,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is definitely a big one.  The town I grew up in has some [huge and genuine issues with immigration](http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Non-UK-population-467-cent-increase/story-19495516-detail/story.html), but the problem is that they're diluted with the views of people who just don't like foreigners.

It's very difficult not to hold similar views as a young adult when 90% of the people you go to school with and the adults you look up to are of the same opinion, that it's all the foreigners fault and that if they'd just bugger off then all the problems would be solved.

I didn't realise how backwards those views really were until I went to Uni and met people from the real world.  It's then you realise that people are all the same no matter where they're from.  Sadly my hometown has little to no investment, and is a pretty poor place.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I think our priorities are much different depending on if Suarez stays or goes, so I guess this should be answered twice (once for each with/without Luis).  I'm less focused on the specific names of players we need to bring in I guess as I'm looking more at where we need to improve players.  I will mention some things about players we're linked with and/or talk about a lot though.


IF SUAREZ STAYS:


1. Defensive cover.  Toure is clearly set for an important role in the coming season and I'm ok with that.  He's a very good defender who brings an amazing wealth of experience to the side, and he's going to do very well to keep us sorted out and focused at the back.  That said, depending on if Skrtel is judged to be good enough in BR's approach to the game, we may be in need of a good CB who can step into the first 11 without pause.  Papa and Alderweirald are the names we're most familiar with and both would fit this pretty well.  Ilori is also still ongoing and should we get him I'd be pretty happy but I don't think he's ready to be our 3rd CB and it'll take him at least a season or two to grow into the role.  I also wouldn't mind seeing a bit of competition for Enrique at LB.  I think he's done a fine job in this past season and he'll be a good player for us as always, but it would be nice to see him pushed and have a more solid backup for him in case of an injury/suspension circumstance.  We're linked with Cissokho pretty much every transfer window and IMO he's a lot like Enrique in style, so he's a decent like for like swap in.  I wouldn't mind something a little different to open up some more tactical options though.  I'm not entirely sure who could be available to us, so I don't want to mention any names. Digne is really good but he seems to be off of our radar at this point (and didn't he just sign for someone else?) and from what little exposure I've had to the young Spanish LB we're linked with from Sevilla, who's name escapes me at the moment, he looks a solid prospect as well.


2. Cover for Lucas.  Allen played really well in this position at the beginning of last season but it was clear to see that it isn't his natural role and I don't think he was ever too comfortable there.  We could really use a solid DM to back Lucas up, although I'm convinced that Lucas is more than good enough to start.  People seem to like to criticize his last season a little bit but he did really well, especially considering the injury he's coming back from.  Lucas is one of those players who you generally only hear his name when he's made a mistake.  The games where everything ticks over and we win well are the ones where we don't talk about him.  He plays his position very well for us and IMO there are a very few players in the world better than him at it when he's in his best form.  Who comes in behind him as backup though?  Apparently we're in for Jorginho but I know nothing about him.  People like to mention Wanyama but that's a pipe dream and I'm not sure he'd be happy to play a second choice role.  He can play CB really well too, so there's good utility there.  I just don't think he's better than Lucas in the DM position, at least not for the way we want to play.


3.  One more attacking player, ideally a CAM or source for goals that comes from deeper than the front men.  Someone who can make a big impact on games when needed and provide an extra threat/dimension to the attack.  We had quite a few times last season where it felt like we were frustrated and couldn't quite find that small advantage to turn a draw into a win, or sneak back in to pick up a point.  If we're able to make the attack a little more dynamic we'll become an absolute hand full to deal with and we'll see a lot less dropped points.  You can argue that defensive errors were the main culprit to those pesky 1-1 and 2-2 draws and for some of our more narrow losses, but I think improving both ends will minimize the bad results.  All of the top sides have incredibly deep and dynamic attacks, all of whom are established/clearly ready to fight at the top of the EPL: 

**United** Chicharito, Rooney, RVP, Welbeck, Kagawa, Valencia, and Nani.  

**City** Aguero, Nasri, Silva, Navas, Milner, Dzeko, Yaya (he counts because he's fucking everywhere on the pitch and must be utter hell to play against).  

**Chelsea** Ba, Torres, Lukaku, Shurrle, Mata, Hazard, Oscar, Lampard, De Bruyne.  

Compare this to our Sturridge, Suarez, Coutinho, Borini, Aspas, Gerrard (although he's playing much deeper now so it's more like he's 1/2 there) and to a much more limited extent Downing, Sterling, Alberto.  Our attack doesn't look nearly as threatening as those three, not even really close.  I listed Downing, Sterling, and Alberto separately because Downing is not good enough to be in the first 11 for a top 4 (or top 6 IMO) team, Sterling and Alberto are too young and raw just yet.  And then Aspas and Borini remain a bit unknown/shaky (though I believe that Borini will be impressive if he stays injury free... I don't know much about Aspas though).  Our attack suddenly looks a bit less impressive when compared to the teams we want to be a position to fight it out with for trophies.  Remove Suarez from the equation and suddenly it doesn't even look close.  I think we're 1, maybe 2 players shy of really having an attack force capable of rivaling those guys if we keep hold of Suarez.  Missing out on Mkhitaryan really hurts because he's that x factor we're looking for.  Players like Eriksen would do well to bolster us, but don't exactly bring a new dynamic or diversify our attack too much.  I personally would like to see him at Anfield as I think he's a quality young player who would fit our system well and thrive here.  But I also think he doesn't bring a new dynamic to what we already have, he's more of a reinforcement and potentially better version of what we have going on already.

-------------------------------------------------------

IF SUAREZ GOES:


1. Attacking players.  Buy ALL of them.  No but seriously, losing Suarez is going to be a crushing blow for our strike force.  It looks a little thin with his name on there and he's pretty irreplaceable for us at our current stage.  We can probably strengthen all across the front 3 + a new CAM and get some much better depth with the money we get from him, but it won't quite be the same, or as good as him, in my opinion.  See my bit on our attack from the first half of this for a detailed explanation, but with the added opinion that not having Suarez really puts us in a dire circumstance.  We will NEED some very high quality signings if he goes, and arguably we won't be able to get the quality we need without the Champion's League.  It becomes something of a 2 step process at that point, where we need to find the players to get us back into the top 4 and then once we're there, we need to attract a couple of world class attacking talents to fight it out from there.  I don't particularly like this approach since we need to be really endearing towards our players and we hate to see them come and go quickly, it just doesn't quite feel like Liverpool to have a huge amount of short stays for important first team players to me (but maybe that's because my opinion is tinted red by players like Gerrard, Carra, Lucas, Pepe, and Agger, who have been here for a very long time).  I'm at a loss for really how we'd deal with losing Suarez in a way that still allows us to make the kind of progress we're looking for.  I have faith in BR and his staff to figure it out and take us onward, so I'll cling to that.  But it's still a worrying notion.


2. Defenders (same as up top).


3. Cover for Lucas.

I've tried to avoid making assumptions about players coming in/going out for the other teams I compared us to as well.  Our more direct competition in Spurs and Arsenal are clearly set to splash the cash on some good front men this summer (and it looks like Arsenal are going to go on a bit of a spending spree before the season starts) so it's harder to compare them, since there's a lot more unknown as to what they're going to look like.  But they're going to be shooting for trying to get in there with the top 3 as well, so it's the same benchmark.",0,1373469935,null,0,false,0,cazqf2l,t3_1i08lz,t1_cazqf2l,t3_1i08lz,null,1430518234,17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"A lot of fair points. Especially the history, I see our history and that of Hackett and their recent fashionable return as being similar. I believe the Hackett partnership is a change in direction aiming possibly to make a Chelsea brand rather than being one of the European brands.

Brashness can come with money, but it isn't an innate part of it. I didn't see how the D&amp;G image was helped by Chelsea or vice versa, in the new deal I believe it's more about creating an image to move forward with. Instead we were just trading of D&amp;G's already popular image. It's a good initial plan but hardly a long term one unless we were actually financial involved with each other.

Also, the Asian market is going to become a lot more self reliant, possibly incorporating the European brands or excluding them depending on how they're marketed. Certainly many brands fear for their market share decreasing with the rapid increase of an Asian middle class that aims for differentiation from the D&amp;G worshiping of the masses.

So in my summary I guess it would be poignant to note that Man U are tailored by Paul Smith (to my knowledge, although I haven't checked recently) and yet they are supremely popular in Asia. I would say that they know what they are and play to it. We are starting to create what we are and what we want to be. Only now starting to play to it. Burberry still would have been great though because their highest end stuff beyond business casual is nicer than Hackett's IMO. Not that the sponsorship will change where I shop ahaha.

(PS, Delta is shit, BA is in decline but it has probably the biggest incoming fleet in the world next year so you can wait, they are investing. I'd just like it to be an Airline I can actually use so that we might get some sort of Chelsea benefits ahaha, also BA is weakened by privatisation actions of government many of BA's advantages came from national deals orchestrated through governments such as the Concorde.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Your second point is a prime example of the sort of thing that the Daily Mail churns out that has made the concept shorthand for silly pandering to foreigners. 

I'm not sure which bit you're talking about from your context.  Which do you mean when you say ""second point""?

&gt; I disagree with your final statement. It means they are different, not inferior. When I go to a foreign country and people speak English to me, it isn't because they are patronising me...

That is to treat my point very glibly.

By ""special treatment"", I'm definitely not referring to language.  If an English-speaking white person was having difficulty understanding me, then, being not-a-dick and (hopefully) kind, I'd do my best to help them.  Just as I would expect the same from anyone for me.

What I think of as special treatment, is when your race/religion gets you special rules.  To think that you must instruct universities (for example, I'm not saying they do this) to lower their standards for minorities is to implicitly assume that the minority is inferior and wouldn't get in without that help.

I _don't_ think any human being is any more superior or inferior to me because of their skin, race, religion, sexuality, or gender.  That's not to say that I don't think some humans are inferior; there are plenty of hatable people in the world, and it's as equally irrelevant what their race is.

It's with that in mind that I find it offensive, for example, when the BBC says a ""group of men have been convicted of being part of a paedophile ring"" again and again and again.  Then we discover that they were all (I can't even remember) Pakistani (say).  It's offensive because the BBC are only afraid of saying that because in the back of their mind (not mine) is ""all Pakistanis are paedophiles"" -- let me stress again, I don't believe that -- it has to be in their mind, because otherwise you would consider race to be just another attribute -- ""five 25 year olds"", ""five men from Oldham"", ""five _MEN_"".  None of which would lead you to conclude that all 25 year olds, old people from Oldham, or all men where paedophiles.

Perhaps I'm overly sensitive, but I'm definitely not churning out ""pandering to foreigners shorthand"".

Even more recently in La Liga, his lack of mobility has occasionally been an issue for Madrid - it would be even worse in the Premier League, which is played at a higher tempo. A midfield duo of Alonso and Gerrard would not cover enough ground to provide an effective midfield shield.

I would absolutely *love* it if we got Morgan Schneiderlin; but, that will neither be cheap nor probable. Milan Badelj is another - he only just showed up at Hamburger SV last season, so he might be too expensive right now, but he's a more defensively capable playmaker; not necessarily a proper DM, but I think he'd do just fine in Rodgers' setup, and I'd say he's a better defender than Joe Allen.

RW: We need to strengthen this position! We want to sign a creative winger that can finish and brings a new dynamic to the team. Mkhitrayan would be good here, but we missed out. This is one position I haven't scouted much on so if there are any recommendations feel free to say :___________: Not sure if Fischer plays RW, but he would be a fantastic signing.

DM: Wanyama. He's the perfect competition for Lucas, he's strong, wins a large percentage of aerial duels, and was one of the best players in Celtic's squad last year. We've also been linked to Jorginho.

CB: Alderweirld or Papadopolous. Two different playing styles, Alderweirld brings a calmer sweeper playing style, while Papadopolous brings an aggresive aerial winning bone breaking playing style. He's not afraid to get kicked in the face multiple times in order to protect the goal. Downside on him is he has a temper, hopefully he won't get banned if he comes. Also we can loan/sell Coates and  bring Illori, I think he'll be a star in the future.

(Politics, History, French), I cried when someone told me congratulations at my old school. They thought I was lucky to even pass them. I probably was. I did zero revision, or work for most of the two years so fair enough. 

However, you were entitled to free courses at local colleges if you were on unemployment. Including A levels. So I signed on the dole, and ended up finding a sixth form college near me. I chose to do 3 completely different A levels. There were only 8 mature students on the whole campus. I think the others were doing some kind of cookery course. I was the only one doing A levels. I was also the only mature student who made it to end of the course. Most of my teachers had no idea I was a mature student. My college was super supportive of me and my position. I also worked my ass off. I did have one issue where the dole wanted me to to a job finders course about 18 months in, but between my doctor and the college I fan-dangled my way in to signing on sick for a week and then resetting my dole. I know things have changed since those days and I don't even know if you can still get the education benefit. But it would be worth looking into. 

Oh and for the sake of completeness. When I went back I took Chemistry, Biology and Math, and for good measure General Studies, although I actually never attended a General Studies class, on account I had already sat through 6 widely spread A levels and just wanted to see how I did. 
I ended up with AAAB, the B was in math and I had to nearly kill myself to get that. I accepted an offer to study Medicine in London and I graduated in 2002.

Did I want Mickey? Sure. 

Did I think Mickey would come to a team that finished 7th, with no Europe, that was arguably a step down from where he was in present day football, that is two to three pieces away from even being close to a lock for CL football? Nope.

Honestly, some Liverpool fans need to readjust to life where we are and stop going on about what we were. Most football players don't care about history. Why should they? They aren't fans. This is their career, their life, etc.

Same reasons I didn't mind Suarez leaving. He's got his career. Why should he wait? For loyalty? Would Liverpool have been loyal to Suarez if he wasn't Suarez? If he was Shelvey or something? No. We'd have shipped him off without a second glance and said a load a tosh about being a club that doesn't tolerate that stuff. 

There is no such thing as loyalty from the clubs perspective. There is only what have you done for us lately? And the same should be the case for the players. Its only fair. 

I frankly don't understand why we even want a marquee signing. Let's consider the marquee signings of the past few years. Only Suarez and Torres were unqualified successes. Johnson has been a great servant to the club but he's only a piece. He wouldn't take any club to the next level.

Then you've got Carroll (which I mostly forgive considering having just lost Torres), Downing, Keane, Aqualani, Henderson, and Allen all bought for 15+. 

In our top 10 most expensive transfers of all time 3 have been outright failures (Carroll, Keane, and Aqua), 3 have been failures considering the fee attached (Downing, Hendo, and Allen - even if they all came good), 1 is good (Johnson), and 3 were excellent (Masch, Torres, and Suarez).

So we're looking at, for the fee attached, about a 35% success rate (5% for Johnson because for 18 million pounds you could do a lot more). 

When you spend big that matters. It gets analyzed. When you spend smaller fees, you have less to lose and more to gain. Both in the eyes of the fans and on the books. Its not just good business. Its good management of expectations. And frankly, that is necessary. Pretending we're one piece away from locking CL is silly. Mickey was not guarantee. 

Compare our squad to the six who finished above us and I'd say we'll be above Everton easy, we're level with Tottenham IF they lose Bale AND we keep Suarez, and Arsenal could be challenged but are always tricky customers.

Nobody really thinks City, United, or Chelsea, despite management changes, will lose out on CL qualification. So you're 3 teams fighting for one spot. Which means everything for money and prestige, but very little once you've bowed out in the last 16.

We're best off buying your Sturridges and Coutinhos. Being smart. If that means we wait, then we wait. Because on Carroll we've lost 20 (+ with wages), on Aqua we've lost 10, on Keane we lost 12, and we just broke even on Masch. Downing will be sold for less for very little service.

All in all we need to be patient. Building through the youth system is the only thing you can do when you don't have City money. And who really wants City money?

Awesome post. 

Not to hijack the thread, but thought I would share a little of my Liverpool experience as well. Went to two matches in early 2011, away at Wolverhampton and another home vs Fullham. Won both, saw Kenny's first win in his short lived second reign. Also I think one of the matches was Fernando's last outting. Also the Wolverhampton match was when Meireles scored his wonder volley. Which was hard to celebrate since I was sitting in the home section.

I was not lucky enough to meet any of the players and unfortunately Anfield was closed for tours while I was in Liverpool.

As a long time fan of Liverpool living in Cincinnati, Ohio it was quite an experience going over and watching a few matches. Hopefully I can do it again sometime soon.

An Access course lasts 6 months and is INCREDIBLY work intensive. I did 30k words for mine, and it was incredibly stressful. I did more work on the access course than I have at my first year at uni. 

As for what it gives you, some universities look down on an access course as a 'lesser' A-level. Some of the better ones demand outrageous results, though this has been curtailed in later years. It will prepare you a lot more for university. A hell of a lot more. The Study Skills they do is normally excellent and will mean there is no stressing involved in writing essays as you will already know what to do.

FKF PRESIDENT HAILS VICTOR WANYAMA

Kenyan Football Players can now make a break through to one of the world’s top football league; The English Premier League after current Harambee Stars Captain Victor Wanyama Mugube made history by signing for Premiership side Southampton.

As a Federation we are extremely thrilled with this move by Victor who has continued to be Kenya’s football ambassador due to his exploits on the pitch.

  It is through his sportsmanship and leadership qualities that led to the federation appointing him as the Stars captain.

 He has always honoured his call up to the Harambee Stars and every Kenyan should be proud of this move, said Nyamweya

 Victor has been a role model to upcoming youngsters in the game and we encourage them to emulate him added the FKF President Sam Nyamweya.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Your first point was a semantic one about fairness versus political correctness.

Well of course it's semantic; that's where we started. [""It actually means""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1hztv0/bbc_news_ossett_cafe_owner_warns_customers_she_is/cazmeg5)?  Erm, semantics is about the meaning of things?  My point is that it is the __political__ part of political correctness that tarnishes it.  It means that the ""correctness"" (whatever that may be) is being done for reasons other than being a good person.  It's being done for political reasons.

&gt; We also ask universities to lower their standards for state school children, who are a majority in this country...

So?  The same point applies -- lowering standards for state school children is nothing more than saying ""state school children are inferior to private schooled children"".  For the reddit downvote brigade: _I'm_ not saying that, I'm state school educated (and a pretty crappy one at that), and I now hold two advanced degrees, so it obviously didn't do me any harm.

&gt; I don't think I really get your points basically.

I'm not surprised; you don't appear to have read what I wrote.

&gt; But the vast majority of sex offenders (by proportion) in this country are white.

I _repeatedly_ said that I didn't think race had anything to do with sex crime.  I was only using sex crime reporting as an example of why political correctness reveals racism -- but you've chosen to latch on to the sex crime part.

I'll try again though: the fact that race isn't mentioned by the politically correct BBC when reporting the crime is because _they_ are racist.  Political correctness betrays them because the nationalities of the offenders were notable by their absence -- if the BBC thought nationality/race didn't matter, then they would treat it just like they do every other attribute.

Sex crime has nothing to do with how old you are or where you are from either, but somehow they can bring themselves to mention those attributes.",0,1373477460,null,0,1373477733,0,caztf9f,t3_1hztv0,t1_caztf9f,t1_cazqvtm,null,1430516743,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Now, in the third message in this thread you get to your main point. Which is that you do not like the word political as it implies reasons beyond altruism/good ethics. Personally, I do not mind why people behave well, as long as they do.

As for schools, no, it is recognising that private school children have a significant advantage in applying for universities and it is aiming to redress that balance. In much the same way that people who do not belong to minority groups have an advantage in many areas of life over people who are members of minority groups. 

I understood your use of sex offenders as an example. It was your only example. So that was why I used it to illustrate my point. Which is that the ethnic background of, for example, sex offenders, is largely irrelevant. As you said, race doesn't have anything to do with sex crime. So why would you mention it unless you were attempting to highlight it? And why would you be highlighting it, in a context like that, for positive reasons?

How does the fact that the BBC doesn't mention people's ethnicities, unless that is directly relevant to the story, but do mention people's ages and origins make them racist? 

This is the point that I am not understanding. Do you think that they are actively discriminating against people on the basis of their race by not mentioning their race? If so, how?

The only kind of oddly circular logic I can see is that you think that people who are politically correct are secretly racist, which is why they are going out of their way in order to not appear so. But for me, it doesn't matter what people actually think, as I cannot police that. If someone hates Africans, but never says so or acts in any way that makes anybody think that they do, then fine basically. They are still dicks, but they are well behaved dicks.

The nickname Mou has never been associated with Chelsea supporters. Jose is one letter longer.

He's the gaffer that brought us our first league title in 50 years and was never called Mou by anyone during his first spell. Jose is a living club legend back for another go at the helm. 

Why is it a bad thing for supporters that actually watched Chelsea when The Special One was in charge to correct people for calling him a nickname created by Madrid supporters? 

It's Jose, not Mou.

20million (minimum) for a guy like him is never going to be worth it. So what if we do spend £20million on him, he scores 30 goals for us, and next transfer window he'll be submitting a request again and fucking us up, posturing for his dream move to Man City!

I've never flown on Turkish but I hear they have a solid hard and soft product, they did have a deal with Barcelona but that has ended as Qatar Airways are the new shirt sponsor for Barcelona

I don't know about BA growing as an airline, the IAG conglomerate has expanded to a point where there aren't many viable routes left, while the Oneworld Alliance has Europe sewn up pretty well with BA, Iberia, Air Berlin and Finnair. As I said, no cabin refresh in the new planes, aside from removing the darkened window shade in F which isn't exactly an improvement. Catering, airborne service are both still some way behind the likes of Lufthansa and Swiss long-haul F

The Asian airlines tend to operate on a realistic model, they make profits or losses and plan accordingly. It's the Middle Eastern airlines which are used in the global dick swinging contest and thereby have free reign by their governments to do whatever it takes. No surprise that Etihad, Emirates and Qatar are frequently mentioned in the top 5 worldwide

You're right, Business and First travel is the real money earner, especially Business. Economy flyers tend to be 'bottom-line' flyers and it's harder to engender loyalty to someone who's only looking at the price. BA and AA have a great partnership because BA has the superior trans-Atlantic network while AA has arguably the most complete domestic network in the US. A lot of codeshares between the two and ground facilities are often shared. However, they operate as separate entities in decision making. AA, while bankrupt technically, is still in the process of acquiring hundreds of new planes while being involved in a reverse takeover with US Airways. BA is acquiring these new planes to start phasing out the ageing 747s it uses for the most lucrative markets (US/Asia). American is using much newer 772s and 773s so isn't in a bad position at all

As for aircraft orders, O'Leary got a huge discount on the 738s he's ordered for Ryanair and a low cost carrier in India, IndiGo, just ordered around $8 Billion worth of metal at the Paris Air Show.

true,Honeybeard,uk,Greater Manchester,"I'm a 23 year old religion-phile (if there is such a thing). I am not really affiliated with any religious organisation, but if I had to choose it would be high Anglican and/or Catholic. I attend various religious services on the weekends and festivals/meetups. The majority of my friends are religious teenagers and young adults, mainly Muslim, Protestant, Catholic, and a little Hindu.

I see a lot of preachers rallying youth using ""extreme"" measures that would naturally be attractive to young religious peoples. For example, talking about how this age is the most important age (only 5% of Britain teenagers are religious, we need to fix this!) or by overemphasising their duties (being described as a ""prayer warrior"" against evil). The teenager/young adult will then take their responsibility as being a child of God very seriously (Soul Survivor was particularly dangerous for this.) To me, this doesn't automatically translate to a fundamental youth, because whilst the measures are extreme, retention is seemingly low. Young people are emotive and rallied easily, they also get bored of repeated extreme measures.  

To this effect, every university will have a 'Christian Union' that is effectively run by a non-university independent group called the [UCCF](http://www.uccf.org.uk/), which is a clever way of bypassing a usual rule that all University Societies must be ran and operated by university students only. The goal of the UCCF is a fairly pro-active evangelism in universities through food, debates, and outreach to their target audience: 18-25 year olds away from home - and it works plenty. My point being, it isn't particularly difficult for a teenager to be classified as a 'fundamentalist' because they are easily swayed. [More about their mission statement and strategy here](http://www.uccf.org.uk/about/mission-vision-values.htm).

For the sake of transparency, I was elected President of the Anglican Society at my university. However, in true Anglican style, we just organised different events that involved a lot of eating and drinking for anybody that came along.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;  I very much doubt that this proposal would affect the big decisions like spending..however I'm assuming this would be a similar type of devolution to that enjoyed by Wales NI and Scotland.

Huh?

This statement makes no sense. Not sure if this was a fumbled typing, but just to be clear

a) Devolution is pretty different in Wales, NI and Scotland

b) ALL of them have devolved spending powers over almost everything. Exceptions include defense, and any international relations work.  Spending powers are pretty much the entire point.

There's no reason to imagine this wouldn't involve spending bills. It would be fairly ridiculous and make it either confusing (in terms of deciding what is a spending bill and what isn't) or meaningless (given pretty much every bill authorizes or requires the spending or raising of revenue).

Apparently there was an agreement with Spurs on when he would arrive which he more or less dismissed and got back late citing some reason or another (i know he was late getting back and it was tied to the flight for his teamates) problem apparently being that Sherwood and Levy found out the reason was not true, Levy fined him 2 weeks wages and he apparently according to some of the people out there pissed off Levy, Sherwood and others (some claim AVB as well but he still seemed to be favored over JD when he returned so i am not sure this is true).  

Then there were comments from others how a large portion of the not footballing staff all think he is more or less an asshole who seems to disregard anyone or anything that isn't Ade related.  Further comments from people who said that he agreed to sign shirts etc and was an ass about it, that he showed up late to appearances etc, that he treats the clubhouse guys / nutritionists etc poorly.

Basically the gist i got from it was that Ade's potential departure was just as if not more rooted to his attitude away from the pitch as was his performance on it. Don't know how accurate any of it was but when i came across it there were numerous people adding little tid bits of their experiences with him.  All in all it made it sound like it was fairly common knowledge that while he was a smiling guy on the pitch he was an asshole off it.

It rankles when you have been surrounded by a culture all you life and someone comes along and starts using terms that are alien and don't sit right with you. That's why people get annoyed on here and on r/soccer.

It's not because people are anti-american, far from it, if they were why would they be on reddit? But it's for the points made above , why wouldn't you want to learn the language and idiosyncrasies of a game that's been around for over 100 years rather than bring in your own anachronisms that seem frankly crass to those who have been supporting the club for a long time.

Those who have been supporting the club for a long time will, in the most part, want to help you understand the club and the players and the culture if you ask, but it's about respecting those things as well.

Loving a football club is about far more than knowing who's a defensive midfielder, or who completed the most passes from defence last season (though of course we all love a stat) it's also about immersing yourself in that culture, it becoming more than a sport, it becoming something you love.

In simpler words, I am a fan of football, not just Chelsea. 


Edit: 

Good to see that this place is full of communists. I am sorry, if I disrespected anyone's feelings with my comment. Kindly don't bother with it, as I am not going to be an active member for long. Based on today's discussion, I realized people are considering Chelsea as a religion, calling ""it is a tradition"" as a valid reason. by this logic, dowry system in India, or burka system in Islamic countries are also to be followed. I mean they are tradition and if I follow Hinduism, I should also take part in dowry system; or if I follow Islam, I should also believe in beheading animals. Right guys? After all, ""it is a tradition"". Well guess what, it is time to explain others why it is a tradition. Chelsea FC is not just a part of London anymore, it is a global brand. Stop asking everyone to hate traditional rivals, and start explaining the reason behind it. If you have valid reasons, people will automatically join you. There is no need for asking blind faith in your traditions, if you can provide reasoning for it. 

For example: don't say ""Rafa is a cunt"" every time someone mentions his name. Simply tell them how his behaviour during Liverpool tenure was anti-Chelsea. Can we please do that, instead of simply downvoting everyone for not understanding your tradition?

Also if we do play a 4-3-3 I have to wonder if Sinclair will see more opportunities opposite Navas.

I cycle to work everyday and it is a rare occasion that I don't have a run in with another road user. Today, it was an Addison Lee driver who overtook me as I was in the cycle lane (fair enough) then turned left, right in front of me - luckily my radar picked up his attempt to plaster me across the side of his MPV. 

I can only imagine how daunting it is for new cyclists, encouraged to take to two wheels by the Olympics, Boris Bikes and the sight of me in tight shorts, to go out into traffic where (certainly in London) the prevailing consensus is that cyclists are ""fair game"". Just check out the tweets of [CycleHatred](https://twitter.com/CycleHatred) to see that motorists are not above deliberately targeting cyclists.

I know that there are parts of London that are still no-go for cyclists (eg Elephant &amp; Castle, Vauxhall, etc) and I don't think I'd want to cycle if my route took me through those.

This proposal appears to suggest a similar case for England, devolved powers over issues that only directly affect England, because as it stands someone in Scotland has democratic voting rights over spending on Scotland, on the UK as a whole, but they also have a say on how England spends it's share of the dosh. In the interests of being fair and giving everyone equal democratic voting rights England also needs a devolved government.

I suppose you're right about BA not really expanding but instead just improving the planes in the fleet to maintain its position. Lufthansa and  Swiss have much better catering services although that's something I definitely overlooked. Also, I really don't know what routes Lufthansa and Swiss fly that well.

Would an IAG and AA merger ever be feasible? I don't suppose it would actually improve the service that much either.

It disappoints me that BA is not as dominant in the real Business/money making sector given its history (I still love the moniker Speedbird) but is there another company that rivals its expansiveness?

Taking the Mou/Jose argument as an example, if you were supporting Chelsea before the first Mourinho era, you're probably going to call him Jose.  I never had heard of the name ""Mou"" until well after he departed, and would never have dreamed of calling him that.  If you started following the club after the Spanish press gave him this nickname, you're probably more likely to use it now.

Same with the rivalries, Liverpool haven't really been our established rivals in recent years, evidenced by them finishing 7th in the league and not competing in the Champions' League.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt; yes England's spending and policy decisions affect Wales/Scotland/NI but not directly and no more than the devolved govts' spending affects England

The NHS in England spends £95 billion. The NHS in Scotland spends £11 billion.

Merely from the point of view of the economic metrics: eg volume of currency, the velocity of spending, the fiscal impact your statement is off, without considering the actual structural impacts of the spending on the whole nation. One is a relatively small budget, with a limited impact outside its sphere. The other is a staggeringly huge enormous budget, that very much has an impact on the greater economy.

I would go so far as to so that in many areas government spending in England has MORE impact on Scotland, than Scottish spending does, simply due to the sheer scale of the issue. The reverse is not at all true. 

I went into some detail in my post above, but I will try to be succinct.

What I am saying is that you under the current system, you cannot govern the UK without being able to pass domestic legislation in England. Devolution of this nature means that voters in Scotland and Wales would have no say in CHOOSING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UK.

That is a considerably greater democratic defecit than not having a say in the tiny Scottish, Welsh and Irish budgets. It is, in fact, an end to the notion that we are a single country, and means de facto English independence, save for the ability of England to set foreign and defense policy.

The answer to this problem is federalism: regional governments. A single body that can make spending decisions for the whole of England IS the government of the UK. Thats how significant such a centralised power is. Either that power needs to be broken down, to levels comparable to the devolved governments that exist, or the entire nation needs a say.

The other answers are the status quo, or independence.

I, personally, see the status quo as the least bad option for the UK as a whole at present, but would love federalism if well executed.",0,1373488923,null,0,1373489710,0,cazy4lv,t3_1hzum5,t1_cazy4lv,t1_cazxpge,null,1430514528,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you really want to make a difference then try to find a way to stop the usual corporocratics becoming MPs again at the next general election. I don't know how to do that - although I've got some ideas that will help. 

Essentially it's the people vs the vested interests (media, political parties, lobbies etc). It's the political parties that control the MPs - they're effectively employees at all but the highest levels, and all career politicians. To break the stranglehold, political party funding must come from taxation rather than donations.

I've said before my thoughts on this - the difference between some match going fans and perhaps some newer fans is down to a variation of reasons, which could be (as already mentioned) a perhaps lack of historical knowledge of Chelsea, or perhaps a lack of willingness to understand the thought process of older fans (if you fall into this category just fuck off), although  I think it may be due to football more being a new thing in America - perhaps some people aren't as clued in on football etiquette as it were, so perhaps people are appearing ignorant when they don't mean to or are not aware. I'm not sure some people are as tolerant of others opinions, which is fine I guess - everyone is different, and we certainly can't change that.

I'm sure most of the Americans would be willing to learn about the history though if there were posts on here every week or so, done in an informative manner and even though might seem basic to the English fans, may be completely foreign to the Americans. I think it's more frustration on te English fans behalf, as it seems everyone else wants to piss on the beliefs and traditions of our clubs history. I'm sure this is not the case however, but this is the Internet and people act before they ask usually.

I'm sure everyone follows other sports, and I'm sure most people are very clued up on history, rivalries etc. so why isn't that seemingly the case for the majority in this case?

Also, that rampant downvoting and blatant hate is in abundance here. Honestly, I have seen comments downvoted to hell for asking not to call Rafa a cunt. And for this, most people start hating the traditions. 

You can go to the ""Jose vs Mou"" post and see the top comments there. Most of them are pretty hard headed, instead of providing a reasonable explanation. 

Thing is, this type of behaviour makes people hate the community. And in turn, it is the community that is at loss, not the new fans. If we keep this kind of behaviour, they will simply stop following Chelsea, and find a new club to root for. No matter how shitty a fan is, (s)he is still a fan, and losing him/her will only be for worse. 

Any way, let us not indulge in this discussion further. I have already made a separate comment about my suggestion to remedy it. Will simply re-iterate it.

The Royston Vasey comment posted below, although I think written in jest, kind of rings true. There is certainly some of that small town syndrome present. That said, I've not really come across anyone from here that is overtly racist or anything and I think the small town mindset is much less prevalent in the younger generation. (It is quite hard for me to put into words or explain what this 'Ossett syndrome' actually is).

We can make *ZERO* assumptions to how he would have been with a gun and the law isn't there to just take risks with every now and then.

A car and a bike are very different. A car accelerating hard at the lights can kill someone whereas it would be very very difficult to kill someone on a bike moving away from a standstill. So your ""logic"" is flawed because you assume that the risks are equal, they are not.

For the record, I have gone through lights in a car, again it's about being a responsible driver not just following the rules for the sake of it. Eg. there is a junction near me where the left + right roads are now closed but the lights are still active. Or when I used to work funny hours and drive to work at 4am, there were some left hand turns which I would take because they were in the middle of nowhere with clear open view of all angles. Again perfectly safe to do so. But putting myself in the same situation on a bike, I never go through the same lights because there is no benefit, there is always traffic up ahead and I gain no time but instead risk 3 points.

Sure, if you do like 30 miles a week, have time for your own servicing, I can see it costing very little.  If you are riding in busy streets, which often have nasty puncture risk (i've got kevlar tires too mind!) punctures happen.

I had a puncture a fortnight until I realised and changed my route.

I can't imagine how it would be so cheap!

Hell even the rubber grips on the bars I've had to replace twice now, and its looking like a third will be needed.  Thats £8 right there!

With Benteke at 25m we are paying potential and hype.  Realistically virtually everyone agrees 15m-18m is a fair price.  But he is a young hot commodity who did well in England so his price inflates.

Andy Carroll was at the time, a young hot commodity who was doing well in England so his price (which lets face it should have been closer to 12m-15m) was inflated, then Liverpool felt compelled to make a big move because they had cash buring a hole in their pocket and there it is.

If they go their own way with defence, then it could be seen as an act of war by Scotland against the rest of the UK, or it could be seen as an act of military occupation by the UK against Scotland. It all depends on the terms of independence.

On the other hand, if Scotland goes the way of the Falklands and gains independence but uses the UK's armed forces for defence, then they wouldn't even need to try and keep it. An attack on it by anyone Scottish, or seen as supporting the cause, would be seen as an act of domestic terrorism, much like attacks in Ireland and Northern Ireland on UK troops.

My view is that these bases are far to valuable for the UK to hand them over to Scotland if independence happens. The UK will make some sort of agreement that, while not ideal for everyone in Scotland, will allow the UK to keep the bases, but it will also give Scotland a pretty decent bargaining point when negotiating full terms of the independence.",0,1373494215,null,0,false,0,cb007i3,t3_1i17w5,t1_cb007i3,t1_cazym7g,null,1430513476,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

Jovetic is guile, he has the athleticism (maybe not to the extent that Benteke does but he isn't Crouchie running on the field) but is much more about finesse and technical ability.

Both are huge prospects, i think Jovetic may have a higher ceiling and probably brings more in the finer aspects of the game than Benteke as it currently stands.

Cons - Prices will increase and due to the Royal Mail's incredibly low prices, they'll still be the market leader for postage in terms of pricing and service.

This is a deal where the general public can only lose. The Royal Mail already has the lowest prices and it has an extraordinary infrastructure, other postal companies couldn't dream of the network of post boxes and post offices that the Royal Mail has.

It is a profitable company, even though the pricing is exceptionally lower than ""competitors"". The Royal Mail needs to be a state ran business with all profits put back into the country, not into private interests.

This isn't a stupid move on the part of government, this is an extremely selfish, malicious and self-serving decision. I've yet to hear a single argument as to the benefit of privatizing the Royal Mail.

Try sending a small to medium sized parcel, look at the prices of the Royal Mail then look at other postal companies, that's why the Royal Mail should stay state run, we will lose a postal business that is costs a fraction of other companies.

I can't see IAG and AA merging, ever. The combined US/AA along with IAG's entities would never pass anti-monopoly hearings. BA/AA barely got away with it many years ago, after vehement pressure from Branson and VS, now 49% owned by Delta. AA is the world's largest airline as soon as the merger is finalised. As it is, I don't see the benefit either. As an AA Exec Plat (and Concierge Key, though that is like foreplay instead of perk 'penetration') I get all the benefits on BA and Oneworld I could want, being a Oneworld Emerald. Most of my flights by number (and delays) are in the US, so being high up in AA's program is about getting the best service in IrrOps which I cannot complain about. They've bought me full fare F tickets on other airlines when the need has arisen and usually I'm rebooked on the next flight before I know my original one has been delayed too long or cancelled

Lufthansa has great food, probably the best in the air. Swiss has a unique presentation, think high tea but with appetisers. The only issue with Swiss is their wine list which is 50% Swiss wines, not a good choice. International F and Swiss wines don't really mix. Lufthansa has this cool setup where you have a proper seat and a proper bed, side by side, really nice once you have tried it and hard to move on from

The Lufthansa First Class Terminal at Frankfurt is arguably the best in the world, huge selling point. Also they drive you to the plane in a Porsche/Mercedes and you have a private elevator to ascend to door level. The Concorde Room by BA at T5 LHR is great but their other lounges are lacklustre. Etihad has a cigar lounge in their FCL at Abu Dhabi, I adore that place

I flew on Concorde a lot and it has a special place in my heart. So much pride from seeing a British plane do what no other could and there was nothing like the feeling of walking in to Heathrow, straight past even the First Class check in and to the private room for Concorde. I was on the final flight as it was my birthday, will never forget Speedbird 1

You're right on BA's eclectic flight map, it really is staggering when you think about it. Direct flights to all continents with a stopover for Australasia. I don't think that can be matched. Emirates wants to do it from DXB but they don't have as many routes or destinations. BA benefitted from Heathrow as Heathrow benefitted from BA. Still the world's most important airport, hopefully that never changes

With regards to BA's profits, TATL J is their cash cow, but it's not guaranteed as other airlines improve. I really hope they get their act together and look up at the leaders instead of getting in to price wars with the rabble, but I'm not hopeful. Market forces though, people want cheap air travel then they complain about the declining service.

The money may have a greater economical effect but it's the healthcare/services of the English that will suffer when this is called into question, scotland has 10% of the population so it should have no more than 10% of the decision making power in terms of this money just to be fair, when in fact it has closer to 15% when considering the control it has over it's own budget and the say it has in the overall government who decides what is spent on just England.

this is what I'm not understanding, apperently you are under the impression that for the government we have to function it needs to be in complete control of policy in England. I don't agree.

 I'm saying the government should only be making decisions that affect the whole UK, and the current system is not remotely fair, either go fully federal and devolved for every region, or have no devolution at all

I'm fairly certain you have the wrong facts about this proposal.
Voters in Scotland and Wales would still have voting rights over the UK, what they would lose is their unfair influence over policies that don't even apply to them. 

Your argument about not being a united country because of this is hard to follow, if devolution breaks up the country following the same line of logic it is already pretty much broken by the devolution of non-England

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;according to a 2011 census the population of England is 53 million, the population of Scotland is 5.2 million England's population is 10.1 times that of Scotland, and yet it only gets 8.6 times the NHS spending, meaning Scots get more money spent on their healthcare per head, so I don't really see your point with that.

I wasn't trying to make point of fairness, that was nothing to do with the issue. (Just FYI spending is A) Set in terms of priorities by the devolved government and B) weighted according to the specific region and its needs, NOT according to population. The North ALSO gets a lot more government money spent on it)

The point was the spending in England is a vastly larger sum,

90bn is a LOT more than 11bn. Its a huge single figure. A single entity dropping 90bn, or otherwise setting broad priorities on how it is to be used, has a very wide effect. 11bn will not have this effect.

Now, if we were talking regional devolved government in the UK this would be very different.

A body in the north east (6% of the population) would receive about £9bn based on government weighting for the region. Other regions would spend amounts based on population of and weighting. Thats entirely unproblematic.


&gt;this is what I'm not understanding, apperently you are under the impression that for the government we have to function it needs to be in complete control of policy in England. I don't agree.

If that is what you think, then honestly all I can say is you don't understand what Westminster does. 90% of its business is addressing spending in England.

Reserved issues are a TINY handful of government business, mostly involving defense and foreign affairs. These are VERY important issues, but they crop up only occasionally.

You would be talking about a government which cannot pass bills on:

The NHS

Education

Policing

Justice and the prison service

Rural Affairs

Local Government

Policing

Economic Development

Transport

And much more besides.

A government unable to legislate on these issues would be a government UTTERLY incapable of day to day business.

I think you think that there a lot more issues that cover the ""whole UK"" and are not devolved to the parliaments. In reality there are very few. 

We are not talking a government not ""being in complete control"". We are talking about a government unable to control 85% of the country and its budget in the most basic way.

&gt;I'm saying the government should only be making decisions that affect the whole UK, and the current system is not remotely fair, either go fully federal and devolved for every region, or have no devolution at all

Thats exactly what I am saying as well.

 What I am saying is that we cannot have a system where the WHOLE of England gets a single unified say, which is what these proposals create. That's a ridiculous concentration of power, one that means it would get to unilaterally have a huge influence over the other home nations, and make it impossible for their representatives to effectively participate in the government of the nation more generally. That would be considerably worse than the status quo. 

&gt;if devolution breaks up the country following the same line of logic it is already pretty much broken by the devolution of non-England

Did I ever say I didn't think that was the case?

Regardless devolution HAS happened, and this is the situation were are in.

My point is we now UK where a few MPs have a small degree of excessive influence over issues they have LESS of a stake in- LESS, not NO stake, because as I have indicated the 80% of the UK budget controlled at westminster covering England has a massive influence on the whole UK. That is somewhat damaged, but it is not completely broken.

It is not an ideal situation certainly. 

However it is preferable to having a democracy whereby 15% of the population get no choice in the formation of the government at all. THAT would be broken.",0,1373496448,null,0,1373497511,0,cb010vg,t3_1hzum5,t1_cb010vg,t1_cb00mib,null,1430513091,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you can get your head round that. Which most people either can't or refuse to accept, out of wilful ignorance.

Use or be seen wielding a legal or illegal blade in a threatening manner and the legal blade becomes an offensive weapon. This means a 1 inch Swiss army blade would be classed the same as a samurai sword.

a shotgun isnt always right for hunting but even so hunters have been caught be animals in forests many times boars or dear is very capable to kill a human and a rifle is no use in close range, think that video of the man running around the tree in one of the big parks from the stag, had be not had a structure wide enough to hide behind he was dead.

as for the need, target shooting. i do rile based target shooting its a brilliant sport that can be accessed by any one including people with disability's that would put them at a major disadvantage in any other sport.
it requires a great deal of skill and practice to get the precision needed, it is not about spray and pay like you see in stupid US vids on you tube

there is even arguments for there use in self defense, you can have M/S and defend you self against a 20 stone thug that would not be possible physically. the unrestricted access like in the US will never help anyone but there is a reason for them in self defense.  

&gt;assault weapons

these do not exist!!!!
no really its a marketing term by scare mongering journalists.
assault rifles are a specific category of military riles that can shoot in a range of fire modes including fully automatic, and shoot a bullet that falls between a piston and rifle round in size.

even in the US non of these have been sold since the mid 80's and non have ever been sold in the UK

the term assault weapons really means a rifle that looks like a military rifle from after the second world war or one that is made in a black polymer style.
they are no different at all then the traditional wooden stocked versions, they shoot the same round at the same speed and hold the same amount but they look modern or black.

any weapon can be made concealable if someone wants to, since the dawn of time criminals have done this with many shot guns and rifles.

I'm sorry most of your wording seems to be incoherent but you are wrong, if someone wants to walk into a crowd of people with a g-18 they are going to do a lot more damage than they would with a remington, it is pretty easy to spot someone carrying one than it is someone a pistol.

Well luckily we have a police force that will likely imprison him, if you care so much about self defense invest in karate lessons, not a gun, killing someone in self defense should always be a complete last resort. We do need cars, imagine if i'm living in richmond and had to work in stratford every day, cars make that possible, especially with the ways houses are priced etc. Your argument for a stag killing a hunter is irrelevant, if this is true can you show me the statistics please? I can assure you whenever i have hunted i have never felt threatened by a stag or a boar, let alone close enough, firing your rifle in the air is enough to scare them off. Back to your self defense point, you'll also find some 'self defense' kills in the us involve a someone coming into the home late and being unintentionally shot, mistaken for an intruder.

true,KultureShoque,eng-rutland,"May Be Foreign, Beware","You seem to think money is an intermediary to barter, which is false. 

Money is a token of power. It is created by central banks and commercial banks out of thin air. It is doled out to certain privileged people and they use it to coral natural resources, land, property and everything of tangible value and intangible too. 

You are made to perform likely pointless tasks to get a tiny share of this token of power, just enough for you to get a car and a semi-detached house with Ikea stuff and a couple of kids who you'll pressurise into conforming to the same life you lead. You are reasonably lucky, you get to have an iPad and a holiday while 90% of the world's population has to serve the powerful by working all hours for barely enough to survive. 

I don't have an alternative myself but I have heard of alternatives that appeal to me even though they would be considered pretty far out if you've never thought like this. 

I like the idea of a money free society based on altruism, also known as the gift economy. I think it's an impossibility though. 

More realistically, money should be created by the state or whatever community organisation we use and distributed to everyone equally based on their need for a share of available stuff. Then we can choose how we use the money for necessities and luxuries. Simple. 

I've been trying to think of a good introduction to alternative thinking on Money. All I can come up with at this time is David Graeber's Debt, the First 5000 Years.You can download the text or audio book here:

When Assange appeared before a London court following his arrest on Tuesday, Gemma Lindfield, representing the Swedish authorities, told the judge that Assange was wanted in connection with four allegations made by two women.

She told the court the first complainant, identified only as Miss A, said she was victim of ""unlawful coercion"" on the night of August 14 this year in Stockholm.

The court heard Assange is accused of using his body weight to hold her down in a sexual manner.

The second charge alleged Assange ""sexually molested"" Miss A by having sex with her without a condom when it was her ""express wish"" one should be used.

The third charge claimed Assange ""deliberately molested"" Miss A on August 18 ""in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity"".

The fourth charge accused Assange of having sex with a second woman, Miss W, on August 17 without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home.",0,1373500634,null,0,false,0,cb02hf1,t3_1i0uze,t1_cb02hf1,t1_cb02fzt,null,1430512403,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

2) Their countries are flat. Really flat. Imagine a pancake, then flatten it. That's positively mountainous compared to how flat they are. London has hills which makes getting around a lot more arduous (Speaking as a south east Londoner).

Despite this, these numbers prove we're doing well, but we can (and imo, should) do much better. I've been downvoted for saying this before, but we have to be realistic about what we can do in London to accommodate cyclists.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You appear genuinely ignorant, going by the language. I'm not attacking you, but these are lines commonly spoken by people unaware of the various arguments in favour:

UK territories like NI and the channel islands have handgun laws in line with those in most US states. Shooters commonly practice there for competitions and it's much the same as any other hobby; regulated but not banned solely on the grounds of possible danger. How many mass-shootings or violent crimes have you heard of taking place there? The point being that it's not firearm ownership that is something to be afraid of. It's an issue of the society which has access to those firearms. See: the USA.

As for ""need"" - you say that shotguns are adequate for hunting, therefore other weapons are unnecessary. This betrays your ignorance, since different weapons and different cartridges exist for different uses. 

A shotgun is not an appropriate tool for hunting everything, so arguing that ""if you want to hunt you can have a shotgun"" is outright silly and oblivious. Besides, we don't live our lives in terms of need. We don't need cars that can exceed 70mph. We don't need a 300 quid Nespresso to fill our heads with caffeine every morning. We don't need alcohol or hamburgers or any number of things. But we use them and fight for our freedom to use them because we live in a society where we are allowed to spend our money how we like and fuck who we like so long as it doesn't affect others. And having firearms follows those lines; the fact that access to mental healthcare and support in the US is so poor doesn't mean every other nation should be terrified and regulate our own laws based on knee-jerking and hand-wringing Helen Lovejoy behaviour. 

Firearms are often so scary to people because they've yet to have them demystified. Firearms ownership and target shooting is like many other things - a fun hobby involving many disciplines and skill development. I also like archery, riding motorcycles, cooking, and playing video games. In each of these disciplines I like challenging myself, learning and improving. The fact that archery and shooting and bike riding involves potentially dangerous machinery should not affect anyfuckingone but me, if I am able to demonstrate that I can do so responsibly.

if something is so incoherent to you point it out i help you understand it its not that hard.

i didn't say i was particularly bothered in life that i need or want one for self defense but again to the wider scope martial arts requires someone to be fit and physically able firearms and training would not.

yes the US does have far to many accidental shooting in what people think are home invasions ect but then i did also say that the US way of unrestricted access was wrong.

again you don't have to have a car it is possible to travel and work even at distance without using a car, in fact many people do it all year around.

sport is a legal reason to do a shooting sport if you really do shoot in the UK then you know this its one of the valid reasons for getting a FAC.

now if you do shoot then i pray for anyone within a couple of miles of you.

did you just really advocate blind firing in to the sky, there are regularly deaths from this in the US and many other country's due to this

pistol bullets are far less lethal and require more accuracy than buck shot from a 12 gauge, there is a fair chance for a pistol round to miss the person, go though and though or miss vital organs where as 00 will shred a nice chunk of a body making it more likely to hit something vital.

Pour encourager les autres. RMT has never met any initiative automating or extending hours that they don't meet with wholesale blackmail of the entire city.

Note the recent news from the Crow:

&gt;  The head of the RMT union has reacted angrily to the announcement that London Underground is hoping to extend the tube's running hours. General Secretary Bob Crow said:    ""It would be nice if senior tube officials had the decency to talk to their staff and their unions within existing agreements before they start spinning ideas out about extending hours and changing procedures. Major changes to operational hours mean major changes to rosters and would of course require the recruitment of more staff. They would also impact on maintenance, fleet and engineering works. None of that has been discussed with the unions in any forum and RMT does not conduct its negotiations via the media.""

Assange has been granted asylum from the US threat not the sexual allegations in Sweden. If don't believe this then the propaganda has worked. Ecuador are also on record stating Assange must resolve that issue but not until his safety is assured—there is no flight from justice. You are actually changing your point now extradition is generally relevant but the point that extradition from the UK is easier or from Sweden is irrelevant because he's in Ecuadorean protection not the UKs and not Sweden—it's just a deliberate red herring propagated by the likes of Allen Green.

You have not been exclusively restricting yourself to facts but falsehoods and negative opinion.

&gt; As for the Ecuador thing I was just mentioning how this isn't coming from the goodness of their hearts and is only a big ""fuck you"" to the Americans.

Okay, so if it is okay for you to say Ecuador is acting in bad faith is it okay for me to say that these women once learning of their shared bedfellow sought to seek a malicious prosecution against Assange?

&gt; shill

It was said in jest. David Allen Green penned [this misinformation piece on Assange](http://www.newstatesman.com/david-allen-green/2012/08/legal-myths-about-assange-extradition). You brought up explicitly:

&gt; Two: “Assange is more likely to be extradited to USA from Sweden than the United Kingdom”

and

&gt; Five: “By giving Assange asylum, Ecuador is protecting freedom of the press”

Just for your information the most serious Swedish allegation warrants a 2-4 year sentencing, and the ""crime"" if found to have happened is only just inside the category which includes at the other end overt violence.

Unless you naturally have dark curly hair that can be grown out into a 70's mop.... you'll have to get a wig.

It didn't even really need any styling.

The Wig was by Mystique. Style NOLA. Color #8. (although Color No. 6 would have worked too- it was just a bit darker brown)

I picked up some extra fake lace brown side burns (because I can't grow any good ones to save my life) from cinema secrets in Burbank for about $35 and I was off and running. They have spirit gum as well if needed.

**Sama:** out on loan, he's 20 get him some first team time somewhere else


**Jones:** out on loan, hopefully to a championship team, maybe that's too much, maybe not. If it is maybe out to a team in spain's 1st league(don't know the name of the one right under BBVA.


**Coates:** Keep for cup games, or sell if he's not looking up to it during preseason. Hopefully he stays because in a few years he'll be one hell of a player.


**Skrtel:** Keep him as a starter/rotation player with Kolo, and Kelly.


**Wisdom:** Play him and Kelly/ Coates together at CB in cup games, and in prem games i'd use him as a back up for Johnson.


Should Skrtel/Coates(or both) leave we should definitely pick up another CB or two, maybe some for the distant future (to partner with/ give competition to Jones and Sama). Hopefully we can pick up Ilori and another solid CB (I'm looking at you Papa and Alderweireld!)


On another note, I've been blowing up this sub about a possible ""replacement"" for Suarez should he leave. Most people seem to think that we need to buy another striker, but with Sturridge, Borini, Aspas (capable of playing there/has in the past), and Yesil (hopefully breaking through), we don't really need another forward.

I was going to point out to you that money existed as a means of barter well before the creation of central financial authorities and that processes such as inflation (which is what im assuming is what you meant by creating money) happen entirely naturally without any intervention - for example in the early 16th century there was a period of rapid inflation caused by the Spanish bringing treasures to Europe from the new world. And of course in Weimar Germany and more recently in Zimbabwe there has been periods of hyperinflation due to banks just creating money out of thin air. (Which of course shows why it's impossible to just create money out of thin air - there has to be something backing the money or it's worthless). 

But it looks like this guy goes into why that's all not true so nevermind.


As for your idea, how is the government creating this money? If there's nothing backing it, then it's just worthless paper, surely? Also, who does all the jobs that nobody wants to do? Stuff like driving lorries or cleaning swimming pools? Work that needs doing yet, let's face it, nobody would ever volunteer for.

1. My favorite Doctor, I would suggest you try either Tomb of the Cybermen or The Mind Robber (No, he's not the Master) and either the Invasion (with animated reconstruction) or the War Games.  These stories show the difference between  Two's long and short arcs very well.
1. I haven't watched much Three, but I have watched Spearhead from Space (His first episode), and Terror of the Autons (the first time we see the Master) and liked them both.
1. For Four I would suggest the Ark in Space, it was the episode which got me started on Classic Who.  I would also suggest you try City of Death (by Douglas Adams under a pseudonym) and Genesis of the Daleks (First time we see Davros)
1. I would suggest Earthshock and his final episode Caves of Androzani (Voted best serial of all time in one poll)
1. Six had a lot of duds, but I would try Vengance on Varos (great social commentary in a very enjoyable story), and Trial of a Timelord
1. I haven't watched much Seven, although I intend to, but I suggest Curse of Fenric and Remembrance of the Daleks (I haven't watched Remembrance, but I have heard too many good things about it not to suggest it)  Ghost Light is also a very interesting story from Seven

Bit late to the game there, buddy!

I'd say it boils down to these major points:

His skill set is a) not that of a lone striker and b) better utilised elsewhere. He can score goals, but as a support player rather than an out  and out striker.

Which leads me on to: I don't think he'd be at all effective with 2 CBs marking him. Where he plays, if it's just behind the striker or on the left wing, he plays in between the 2 banks of players, defenders and strikers.

Here:

RB - CB - (STRIKER) - CB - LB

(LW - CAM - RW)

RM - CM - CM - LM

Of course that's a simplification. Attacking players are in brackets. The idea being that a striker is traditionally marked by 2 CBs, whilst Dempsey requires space to either bang one in from outside the box or nip a ball through.

And it's this fact that he's unmarked from that CAM role which means he can indeed poach into the box and score goals. If you ever watch Frank Lampard, he is the king of this. Scoring goals from midfield. While the defenders are worried about the striker(s), the midfielders can swoop into the box unnoticed and tap it in!

And a final note, he's simply not as good as our other strikers, despite them not being particularly special themselves!",0,1373504274,null,0,false,0,cb03p4o,t3_1i1pp3,t1_cb03p4o,t3_1i1pp3,null,1430511832,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Although the timing of the allegations happened around the time the US issued a warrant for him and lets be honest It's not beyond the realms of possibility that the US constructed these allegations against him as Sweden has a history of extraditions of prisoners to the US.

What he helped to expose to the public was indeed important for people to know (Double tapping of Civilian first responders, a criminal act of war) and considering that Bradley Manning has been held indefinitely without trial for leaking those documents and subjected to torture while in US custody and could face the death penalty. Add to that their attempts to silence and bring to ""justice"" Edward Snowden for exposing the most criminal spying program and violation of human rights specifically in regards to privacy while also violating the 4th amendment of the US constitution.

America is attempting to flex it's weight and has shown flagrant disregard for European law on several occasions. This is a country that rents part of a country they consider to be enemies and communist's to indefinitely detain without trial illegally extradited terrorism suspects many of whom have been found to be innocent but are still detained ( I believe the number is around 80 people )

I think that we should just allow Assange to leave the country to travel to Ecuador where he has legally claimed and been given asylum which he is fully entitled to under EU and international law especially where an individual is being targeted for a political purpose has legitimate concerns he/she will not be given a fair trial those rights are protected.

Add to that he is costing the UK taxpayer money and draining an already stretched police budget We should just allow him safe passage as would be entirely in our power and legality to permit.

true,thunderingblue,BR,brazil,"Agree with you 100%. I could be different but I've always been intrigued with the history of Chelsea FC and wanting to soak up as much knowledge about the club I support as possible.

While I was visiting Prague two summers ago, I met two old English friends, one a Nottingham Forest supporter and the other a Chelsea supporter, at the Letna beer garden. For the next three hours I sat and listened to everything they had to say regarding Chelsea and Forest, their experiences, the ups and downs, all of it.

It dawned on me that night, there's a difference between being a fan of the club and a supporter of the club. As a supporter I think you have to do your due diligence to the learn the history and traditions of the club. Calling Jose, Mou, is not something I've ever heard a Chelsea supporter call him until the last few months when the speculation he could return started popping up. 

So I think some people might not understand the reasons why tradition is important to the supporters. All in all, shouldn't newer fans want to learn the etiquette and understand the nuances older supporters feel regarding issues like these?

Being a supporter from the States I certainly don't want to be labeled a glory hunter or lumped in with folks that don't have the same passion towards the club, but are more vocalized on here than myself.

You're getting down voted not because you're asking a question, but because us LFC fans have learned how profoundly false that type of thinking is. The difference in impact between Coutinho/Sturridge and the likes of Carroll/Downing is massive, but the fees for the former don't even add up to one of the latter. Even Suarez himself was comparatively less expensive.

The idea that ""everyone knows who the good players are"" is a very simplistic understanding of the transfer market. Just because a player is going for big money and big clubs are in for them doesn't guarantee success. To take one of your examples, look at Lewandowski. He's a very good young player with great experience under his belt, but also has a poor conversion rate for a striker. Now, imagine 'pool splashes 30m for him and somehow he agrees to sign, and Suarez stays because of the commitment to winning. Could go great, but could also see his conversion rate drop even farther in a brand new league, and without decent depth (because the whole budget was spent on a name signing) Liverpool has another tough season. We've seen it happen with big names before, more established players than Carroll. It's not that crazy of a proposition, and Liverpool can't afford a Torres-type sunk cost  like Chelsea.

Instead, the team's decided to strengthen a few key areas of the starting 11 and add depth by signing young players who are soon out of contract or will come cheap for other factors. Personally, I trust enough in the scouting team to believe that at least one of these will strike gold, but our worst case scenario is several solid players enhancing the squad - each for under 10m.

My assumption is that the 50th anniversary takes place within the doctors time stream so he is able to interact with the other doctors. I also wouldn't be surprised with we actually see 8 and 9 at some point.

 Imaging the time war as the deepest scar on the timeline. Paradoxes that never completely heal themselves. The Hurt Doctor can be a past, present, and future incarnation of the doctor -the valeyard, the beast, and the storm. 

Looking into the untempered schism as child the doctor saw his potential and promised himself to do no harm. 

The beginning there was good and evil creating the chaos of creation. A third force ""The Other"" emerged the balance between the two, before returning to the matrix. Emerging only when necessary to maintain entropy.

When the doctor looked into the schism through the matrix of existence he saw the Other peering back at him. The Doctor knew that at anytime he could call on that power if needed - but a power that did not  discriminate between the good and bad.   

During the time war as an injured 8 completes ""The Moment"" he regenerates into the Hurt Doctor, realizing that all may be lost - the Hurt Doctor calls on The Other watches instead as the Nightmare Child and  the other horde of travesties emerge into reality. Reality warps and he sees the creation of the time lords and daleks. Reality warps again and sees himself at the origin of the universe emerging from good and evil. 

Realizing that he is still regenerating he uses ""The Moment"" device and erases himself from reality and by default time locking both the time lords and daleks having erased their creation.

That is Torres' league form since he's been at Chelsea, why on earth would we sign him?

It's a shame we bought Carroll for £35m because it's made people completely forget that selling Torres for £50m was only the best transfers in the last decade, it's up there with Inter getting £20m + Eto'o for Ibrahimovich.

Torres is physically gone, he's lost all strength, power and pace that made him a world class player and he hasn't been able to adapt to his current physical condition, which means the goals have seriously dried up.

For us, he was movement, pace and finishing and that was it, he has none of that now and it would be a really backwards signing. After identifying and signing undervalued players like Sturridge and Coutinho, to sign a dried up has-been like Torres would be a step backwards.

How to make MDMA / MDA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine)

	   The following synthesis is not meant to be carried out by a novice
      chemist, although it is not terribly difficult.  For descriptions of
      how to carry out the procedures, a standard lab procedures reference
      manual should be aquired by the reader (or preferably the reader 
      should take college organic chemistry).
	   This is the synthesis for MDA which can be found on page 79 of
      Psychedelic Chemistry, which was first published in Chemical Abstracts
      52, 11965c (1958).  The former however has the above noted
      typographical error of 75 ml 15% HCl being written as 57ml 15% HCl.
      The original article also has a typographical error.  In the synthesis
      of MDA from the ketone it reads H2O2 where it should read H2O --
      following the former procedure would be explosive.  As a side note,
      this is the same process of making the ketone from isosafrole as
      Shulgin uses in PiHKAL, thus the synthesis of the ketone is somewhat
      more verbose than the synthesis of MDA from the ketone.

      To a well stirred, cooled mixture of 34g of 30% H202 (hydrogen
      peroxide) in 150g 80% HCO2H (formic acid) there was added, dropwise, a
      solution of 32.4g isosafrole in 120ml acetone at a rate that kept the
      reaction mixture from exceeding 40 deg C.  This required a bit over
      1 hour, and external cooling was used as necessary.  Stirring was
      continued for 16 hours, and care was taken that the slow exothermic
      reaction did not cause excess heating.  An external bath with running
      water worked well.  During this time the solution progressed from an
      orange color to a deep red.  All volatile components were removed under
      vacuum which yielded some 60g of a very deep residue.  This was 
      dissolved in 60ml of MeOH (methyl alcohol -- methanol), treated with
      360ml of 15% H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and heated for 3 hours on the
      steam bath.  After cooling the mixture was extracted with 3x75ml
      Et2O (diethyl ether) or C6H6 (benzene).  Its recommended that, the
      pooled extracts can washed -- first with H2O and then with dilute NaOH
      (sodium hydroxide).  Then the solvent is removed under vacuum to
      afford 20.6g 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone (3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl
      methyl ketone).  The final residue may be distilled at 2.0mm/108-112 deg
      C, or at about 160 deg C at the water pump.
	   Add 23g 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone to 65g HCONH2 (formamide)
      and heat at 190 deg for five hours.  Cool, add 100ml H20, extract with
      C6H6 (benzene) and evaporate in vacuum the extract.  Add 8ml MeOH
      (methyl alcohol -- methanol) and 75ml 15% HCl to residue, heat on
      water bath two hours and extract in vacuum (or basify with KOH and
      extract the oil with benzene and dry, evaporate in vacuum) to get
      11.7 g 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).
       
     ===&gt; To produce MDMA substitute N-methylformamide for formamide in the
      above synthesis.

The exchange of ideas is a beautiful thing that's taken far too lightly so for what it's worth, the subreddit will be better if you stay and continue to be vocal. As long as you're not antagonistic - especially if folks outright shut you down or call you plastic - you'll get people to think as well as separate yourself from the triabalists. 

Personally, I think the Jose v. Mou debate is a small scale example of the globalization of English Football. You can extrapolate further -- it reflects  the anti-supporter state that's happening as a biproduct of the growing commericalization of the Premier League. 

Mourinho was called 'Mou' by the Spanish press for nearly 3 years. He was coach of Real Madrid, arguably the biggest club in Football hence the 'new' nickname carrying over to his English return. 

I called him Mourinho, always have and always will. As for the debate, Mou has much more versatility to create Mourniho centric tabloid headlines:
 
""Mou-ve over, Rafa"" 

""José tells us Mou-re about his return to England"" 

""Chelsea's Mou-n rises"" (sorry City fans!)

Averaging statistics over the country is also JUST as misleading. The common man doesn't care about ""nationwide averages"", he cares about his neighbourhood, his community, the place where he grew up and has seen change beyond recognition in the last 50 years.

Indeed, in London, only something like 45% are white. So is someone in London who says ""it's all foreigners here"" misinformed ? Or is using national averages to address the concerns of an individual the REAL misinformation.

Likewise with crime. To say crime has gone down is a nonsense, because for many areas the concentration of crime is at an all time high. You can't take the crime on an inner city housing estate, and the crime in the Highlands of Scotland, average them together and claim there's not a problem. Because for those people living on that inner city housing estate, it still IS a problem. The fact that Scottish sheep farmers are sleeping a bit more soundly doesn't affect them one iota.

decision to charge is taken at a very early stage; there can be no doubt that if what Mr Assange had done had been done in England and Wales, he would have been charged and thus criminal proceedings would have been commenced.

In each incarnation that I have seen, the Doctor will come in an take control as if he has every right to do so. He will sometimes do with buffoonery - Tom Baker was really good with this. If a female Doctor did this, it would have to be done very, very carefully every time to keep a lot of people from saying ""God, what a bitch"". That is not sexism in the show, but the sexist viewpoint that many people hold about women in power. 

It was tried a bit from time to time with the River Song storyline. River was better at working the TARDIS than the Doctor. River could sometimes tell the Doctor what to do, but when it really came down to it - if the Doctor told her to do something, she did it. 

Honestly would you really watch DW if he or she politely asked people to do everything. Dr Who has always been more than a bit arrogant except maybe for the first few actors that I haven't actually seen. I personally do not see that type of ego being accepted from a women and ultimately Doctor Who is about having fans.
