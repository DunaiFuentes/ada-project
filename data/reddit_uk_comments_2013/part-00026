In my vision, I'd see students writing the code to calculate mathematical equations such as completing the square, integration from first principles and other topics that today are jammed into your head as rote. By expecting students to write the logical steps involved in completing these steps, everything needs to be done from first principles and thus forces the student to deeply understand what is happening.

If anything, rendering graphics computationally will expose students to what they can expect from actual real world experiments.

Having been to prison it's not quite like that.

The low level medical attention is very good if all you need is a nurse. Minor injuries, colds, flu, vaccines, blood tests, infections - basically anything you would normally go to your GP for and you'll get treatment within a few hours of falling ill, which is faster than the real world. And it's a real external NHS nurse or doctor, not a member of the prison service.

Now for more serious issues, this is a massive problem. Have cancer? Forget it you aren't getting treatment for many years, break a limb? You're going to be suffering for many painful hours until they can arrange a specialist to come and sort it. Also, due to abuse the only painkiller they prescribe in prison is Paracetamol, I'm not even joking, literally for everything.

Also there's literally no dentists available, and the only toothbrushes are terrible, so you better look after your teeth and mouth in prison or you're going to have a bad time.

Due to life being so generally shit inside *(it's really not how the media make out, unless you're some millionaire drug dealer who can pay the guards to bring you stuff like iPhones, take away and drugs in)*, most people *(but not myself)* get signed onto the prison methadone program, which is an artificial replacement for heroin that the NHS use and gets you high. It passes the time away and they can't refuse you access to the program, plus they push it really hard inside with advertising etc, so even people without a drug or heroin program when they go into prison join up onto it.

true,nobuo3317,mcgann,McGann,"They aren't essential to watch by any means, but it will give you a bit of insight into just how far the series has come, and how much of the original elements have been kept. For instance, a lot of the monsters and effects were horribly laughable, which brings a lot of charm to the show in my mind. Some people aren't as big on b-style sci-fi though.

There are some things you're missing slightly, but it's more just references. For example, the Doctor first fights the Nestene Consciousness (the enemy in the very first nuwho episode) as the third doctor in The Spearhead From Space, which features U.N.I.T., which was introduced with the second doctor.  The doctor was actually stuck on Earth during that time working with U.N.I.T. for awhile, and sometimes battling the Master.

Personally, I find the second story ever to be well worth watching, as it offers a very interesting introduction to the Daleks. This version of their history can be disputed, but I like it nonetheless.

Probably the most important reference you'll have missed will be Sarah Jane Smith and K-9. She's constantly hailed as one of the Doctor's most loved companions, and is the only one to return from classic Who.

If anything, you might pick and choose some episodes that sound interesting to you. If you're looking for something a little...easier to watch than the very beginning of the series, you might skip ahead to some of the third and fourth doctors' stories.

This horsemeat must be the stuff they can't sell as horsemeat elsewhere. Why would that be? It's because racing horses, in particular, are sometimes rammed full of steroids which are known to be very harmful to humans, including being carcinogenic. This horse meat is banned and, as a consequence, it is completely worthless - hence, it's now cheaper than beef.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Firstly, I don't think it's equally talented - Skrtel looked good last season, when the defensive line was deeper, the fullbacks less attacking, less building from the back and less pressing; but he hasn't impressed in the new defensive style, and has lost his place to Carragher when he should be entering the best years of his career. And Reina is now into his second consecutive error-prone season, as opposed to being the man who regularly competed for the PL golden gloves.

But that's a minor point - the bigger point is that there's way more to 'goals conceded' than just looking at the identity of the back 5. The biggest factor is that we're adapting to a whole new system - passing our way out from the back, which means that teams can force mistakes out of us by pressing, and a high defensive line with lots of pressing and fullbacks high up the pitch, which makes us very vulnerable on the counter. It's no surprise, then, that we've made a lot more individual defensive errors this season - some of which just come down to players not being in form, others which come down to being exposed in an unfamiliar defensive system.

There's no doubt the defensive unit needs work - Carragher will need to be replaced, and Skrtel &amp; Coates will need to regain Rodgers' trust otherwise they'll both be leaving (and need to be replaced). Reina's future is in doubt as well, while we still need cover at left-back. ",0,1360323036,null,0,false,0,c8bj6sk,t3_183lv1,t1_c8bj6sk,t1_c8bizio,null,1431229403,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You're confusing parties with collusion and collaboration. Collaboration is fine as long as it's transparent and accountable. I have no doubt that if you ban parties that people would look to vote in blocs, but that these blocs would be freeform and more based on issues than political association for the sake of it. You could enforce against collusion through a combination of the civil service, laws and the police.

&gt; Q. What is an animal health supplement?

&gt; A. A product intended to support maintenance of normal biological structure and function in animals which are **not intended for human consumption**, such as dogs, cats and **horses**. These types of products are also called dosage form animal health products. Joint support products containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate or MSM are examples of animal health supplements.

[source](http://nasc.cc/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=38) 

Horses are generally given supplements, so horse meat would generally contain chemicals not meant for human consumption.

Going by the odds, the chances are fairly good the meat wasn't fit for human consumption.

For all they know, the meat could be coming from old race horses.

within each body system category and have been reported during clinical trials, with use of the marketed
vaccine, or with use of monovalent or bivalent vaccine containing measles, mumps, or rubella:

&gt; Death from various, and in some cases unknown, causes has been reported rarely following
vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines; however, **a causal relationship has not been
established in healthy individuals** (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). **No deaths or permanent sequelae were
reported in a published post-marketing surveillance study in Finland involving 1.5 million children and
adults who were vaccinated with M-M-R II during 1982 to 1993**.56

The Dembele/Sandro pairing was much better than the Dembele/Parker pairing we're seeing now, Sandro being more of a dynamic player in possession than Parker and more mobile shielding the back four in defense. Dembele has been great this season but you're spot on in saying he needs help from a third player dropping into midfield or finding space between the lines. Spurs have looked disjointed and uncreative far too often this season when they try to play through the middle, which leaves them looking to the flanks. Which is fine, but when the wide players resort to picking out crosses into the box, it's less than ideal when they're aiming at Lennon and Defoe as opposed to Adebayor or Crouch in the past.

It would be interesting to see AVB put Dembele behind both Holtby and Sigurdsson, instead of the double pivot of Dembele and Parker/Sandro. I honestly don't think he will do it, but I'd love to see it. And wouldn't tomorow be the perfect day? No Defoe and how much Adebayor and Dempsey will have in the tank after travel and international fixtures is a big question mark.

The usual back four, Bale and Lennon on the flanks, a midfield trio of Dembele/Sigurdsson/Holtby and then, I don't know, Harry Kane up top? Can't see them fielding two strikers from the start tomorrow given the injury to Defoe and Dempsey and Ade's ability to go ninety minutes.

And, yes, Dawson's long ball ""distribution"" has been maddening. The QPR game(and I'll look for his passing chart from that match later) was brutal. 'Arry allowed Dawson and Vertonghen all the time in the world on the ball and neither did much of anything productive with this opportunity. And Dawson was dreadfully wasteful blasting the ball away and cheaply giving up possession against a QPR side that was blatantly parking the bus.",0,1360335541,null,0,1360335733,0,c8bl6to,t3_182p45,t1_c8bl6to,t1_c8bbw1p,null,1431230385,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2
true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"&gt; The company would make an overall profit, but my specific department does not. It is subsidised from the profit-making part.

Fair enough. Point rescinded

&gt; Â£20 victim support charge.

I know what it is and I still think it's absolutely pointless. Where do fines go if not towards court costs and victims? 

&gt; No

So this was a spurious prosecution then and the people who brought it should be challenged over that, and possibly charged with wasting the court's time - especially if as you say it is not profitable. Ironically that would plead to an even bigger waste of court time because unlike her they would not please guilty (which was the wrong decision on her party, I feel) 

&gt; At no point did I say that the company isn't to make a profit; it does make a profit and it does come out of taxpayer funds. 

An this is pretty much why I do not believe any part of the system should be privatised. The only part that should be independent of the state is defence lawyers and that's to avoid a conflict of interests. The same argument could be made for judges, but I don't believe for-profit judges are an acceptable idea, so we will have to trust that they are trust worthy and impartial. 

&gt; there are ways that the company tries to reduce costs

This is the argument usually levelled in favour of privatisation, but I feel this sort of thing should not be governed by profit. 

&gt; I know you only made the original comment in jest; I just wanted to clarify how the breach and court system works.

And it has made interesting reading, so thank you. But I fear we are going to have to agree to disagree because my anti-corporate and anti-authoritarian prejudices will get in the way.

If you are taking a theory test, then I would recommend [the official DSA stuff](http://www.whsmith.co.uk/Products/The-Official-DSA-Theory-Test-for-Car-Drivers-16th-2013-ed+Paperback+9780115532313). Naturally, the highway code will benefit you greatly, too.

For your practical test, ask your driving instructor what the requirements are and what categories you can be marked down in. If he has any marking sheets handy, it would help to see one and maybe ask him if he could go through a mock test with you.

If you want to learn to drive, and by that I mean *learn to drive* then you need as much practical experience as possible in as many different areas and conditions as you can drive to. Driving lessons are fine, but they won't prepare you for much. This sounds stupid, so let me clarify:

Most people set aside an hour a week for lessons when driving. For me, my lessons with my instructor was just before lunchtime on a Friday. The roads were fairly quiet and did not present much of a challenge once I had the basics of vehicle control down. I had a lot of experience driving on quiet roads near the test center, and if you pass your test after driving around an area when the roads are quiet you're not going to be too well prepared for when you're able to get in your car at times when conditions won't be favourable.

The real experience came from driving to Tesco at night with my brother and his girlfriend every couple of weeks. It would be dark, sometimes it would rain and the route would be much different. The car would have much more weight in it and the handling and acceleration would be greatly affected, making me re-think when I could pull out at junctions. With large roundabouts you couldn't see the road markings on, busy roads, roadworks and shitty visibility the drive became much harder and I had to be much more aware of my surroundings and what other cars were doing.

With my second instructor I drove at rush hour which was very different from driving at lunchtime. Busy roads, cyclists, crossings in constant use, people running out in front of the car, other drivers being impatient and jumping lights, constant stopping and starting (good for clutch control), the premiership football players who lived locally swerving in and out of traffic in half-a-million pound sports cars, cats and dogs living together and all other manner of hazards that were not encountered previously were there to be seen.

If you want to pass your test, then educate yourself as to what you need to do please the DSA.

Yes, our midfield is incredible. We have loads of talent, and once they grow into the league/each other, we will dominate (at least offensively). As it stands, we need a defensive midfielder or two so that our midfield can transition successfully. Just slapping down 200 million worth of talent doesn't guarantee success, as we can all see. There are elements to this team that must be seen to that should take priority over buying the next hot 50 mil boy.

Third, get rid of Courtois? WHAT could possess a rational thinker to even consider that? Would we have won the Champions League without Cech? No. Absolutely not. He is one of the finest keepers in the world- THE finest, IMO. Obviously, this makes him nearly irreplaceable; BUT WE HAVE COURTOIS. When Cech retires (and retire he will), what sounds more appealing: Slapping another world class keeper who has already had experience with us between the posts, or frantically shelling out 34 million pounds on someone we HOPE can fill the boots. A great keeper can make the difference between trophies and honorable mentions.

Finally, Falcao. He isn't Messi. There will be others. Younger, cheaper, more versatile, better even. The man is on fire at the moment, but we have Lukaku and we're stuck with Torres. What's the point? We should find a younger striker who can deal with playing second and third fiddle to the player we already have, and eventually be groomed into the role.

One part of being on the bins I loved was the miles I put in each day, I was fit by the end of it.  If we hadn't got to a certain street in a certain time, the manager would be moaning at us too (didn't matter if some cunt had blocked the truck or someone had come out to abuse us etc).

I'd be up for working there.  Walking miles each day picking things off shelves in a sheltered environment.  Sounds alright.  

But if people aren't very happy there, Amazon need to realise that in these kind of dead end jobs, you need to be able to have a good crack with the people around you.  But there's a fine line between people taking the piss and working hard, while having good banter with those around you.

That said, the average walking pace is 3.1 mph.  Which over an 8 hours shift would be 24.8 miles covered.  So 7 - 15 isn't that bad over a shift.

The 3 strikes bullshit is too open to abuse.  I also hate the use of catch phrases to dictate policy.  ""Three strikes"", fuck off this isn't baseball.

Although it may be helpful to do Religious Studies (my school calls it Philosophy and Ethics because it's a better definition of the course) because it'll help ease you into your university studies if you wish to go that route. 

If you want to do Physics though you'll definitely have to do Physics and Maths and it may be helpful to do Further Maths as well. Although as someone who took Physics at AS and is doing a the whole Maths A Level I'll tell you they can be very difficult. The gap between GCSE and A Level is far bigger than that between A Level and University.

true,IlliniQuant,null,null,"Here's the problem. On the AM side, they literally have no mechanism by which to enforce said priority. That's the reason I don't understand your point about getting priority because we are paying less. Yes, AM can let us negotiate with him for less than the buyout if we give them Courtois, but they still have to let all other teams who meet the buyout negotiate as well, so there's no advantage there. 

And for your second point, maybe Falcao indicated they would give us priority (I hope not, as that would mean that we entered discussions with a player under contract,a big no-no), but then why would Falcao care about us giving Courtois to Madrid? 

It's important to recognize that there are two separate negotiations in a player transfer. First you have to negotiate with the selling club in a sale price. Once that's fine, you have to negotiate with the player on personal terms. The two are not related to each other at all except for the fact that A needs to happen before B.

This is why this rumor makes no sense. Offering Courtois helps with the first and doesn't help at all with the second. But the first is already automatic by making the buyout price! ",0,1360358559,null,0,false,0,c8bsq1e,t3_184ybu,t1_c8bsq1e,t1_c8bsj33,null,1431233963,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

It would be nice to see them extend their networks but, yeah, it's not going to happen now.

I remember finding out that there was a cable TV franchise allocated for North Wales. By the time any company showed real interest in taking it up, the plan had switched to some form of wireless broadband, the TV part of the service having been dropped.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"At the moment the industry is controlled by a mixture of local growers (which I'm ok with) but also real gangsters.

Just like prohibition era in America, when something like cannabis is illegal these hard criminals thrive.  They can use violence, extortion and the end product isn't always as healthy as it should be.  But it's not like the consumer has any protection from that.

It means that humans are trafficked and forced to work in houses converted into grow rooms.  Slavery is a real issue and it's happening on streets where we live because of the legality of this relatively harmless drug.

Decriminalisation just means that the user isn't punished as harshly, but still means that behind the scenes it's still controlled by gangsters.

Cannabis is something I want to see **legalised**.

In Holland the usage rate is lower for teenagers and adults than it is over here, even with their current decriminalized stance.  They are taught in school, not the ""just say no"" or ""talk to frank"" bullshit we get here, but they have honest and open discussions about it.  In turn a lot of the teenagers over there think smoking cannabis is actually a bit lame (the entire cannabis culture is a bit of a joke too).  But there is still an issue of organised crimes behind the scenes.

Cannabis has negative issues, but the risks and harm is very low.  So let's legalise, regulate and make it safe.

Let's put the money raised in taxes towards real education for children and adults.  Rather than saying ""just say no"", let's have honest discussion about drugs.  Let's put those taxes towards helping the small minority of people which suffer from issues after usage.

Let's create a booming cottage industry just like our home brews and micro breweries.  Let's replace these empty shops our high street with nice cafes where we can enjoy a smoke and a coffee.  Let's take the streets back from the drunks that turn our centres into war zones each weekend.

Let's allow people to have a joint without running the risk of being criminalised and effecting their future career prospects.  Let's allow adults to get high and feel good after work without the dirty handover you get from drinking booze at the weekend.

**Can't I just have a smoke, vape or edible without fear of prosecution.  Please, just leave me be.  I'm not harming anyone using cannabis, neither are the vast majority of us.**

How could I describe the taste of a 28 day ages steak to someone that's never eaten beef?

If you've been drunk before, then you'll be aware of how drugs can change your mood and perception.  Cannabis does the same but in different ways.

The best way I could describe it is like getting drunk (you get a buzz), but without the sloppiness, and rather than being aggressive and self assured, you internalise thoughts and are a bit more open.  You become a bit more sensitive.  It's really easy to get giggles, but it's also easy to get a bit worried.

Touch, taste, thoughts are all enhanced.

You might feel like playing the guitar for hours, finding riffs you may have never thought of sober, or you may just want to watch TV and stuff your face with crisps.
 
Some people smoke it and get a bit scared, a bit worried, a bit paranoid.

Essentially, it feels good to most people.  Just like having a drink, having sex or having a laugh with friends feels good.  It's not for everyone, but most people enjoy it.

Not to mention it's a good racket to get into. People pay _through the nose_ for some good venison, when often it's stalked simply because it's a pest or because their population explosions mean they need to be culled to prevent starvation, and it would be thrown away if it wasn't eaten. 

Very little in terms of initial outlay, especially if you're a hobbyist shooter - just a stalking course to ensure you can dispatch them humanely, and the cost of ammunition - and as long as it's hung and prepared up to standard for human consumption a very big chunk of profit comes from it.

If the Police stop and question you, you don't have to answer any questions AT ALL, including name. 

If they stop and search you (they have to have a reasonable grounds to search you) then you have to give them details but they also have to give you a record of the search (if you want one). 

EDIT:: 

As pointed out you don't have to give your name even in a stop and search - unless you're being reported for an offence. The things that have to be recorded by the Police in a stop and search:

1.   Date, time and place of the search;
2.   Your self defined ethnicity (if provided) / Observed ethnicity;
3.   What they were looking for;
4.   Their grounds for searching you / legal power or authority used;
5.   The Officerâs details;

Baronetcies aren't peerages, so holders didn't get seats in the House of Lords, and they're not nobles. However they were eligible to run for parliament (in the house of commons), which peers are banned from doing.

They would be considered part of the landed gentry which were a class of people (not legally defined) who derived an income from large country estates and didn't need to work for a living.

Despite their wealth, they wouldn't have necessarily been completely disconnected and idle. They had to run their estates, and they were eligible to vote (in an era when many couldn't). They had the time, money, and social position to find positions such as MP, Magistrate, or Sheriff (not in the american sense) within their reach.

They would probably have seen themselves as important individuals, at least in their communities. They'd perhaps felt an obligation to become involved or maybe an entitlement to take such positions. Their younger son's might end up having careers in the church, army, or navy, while their eldest prepared to take over the running of the estate.

I don't know if Baronets would be looked down upon by some for having bought the title.

It should be legal for a number of reasons. It is much less harmful that alcohol but obviously there is still the smoking aspect of it but it has been proven that cannabis itself contains less carcinogenics than tobacco. The drinking culture in the UK is a much larger problem than any amount of cannabis consumption. If legalised, taxed and regulated money would be pulled away from policing cannabis production and trafficking and could be put into much more pressing issues that really have a detriment to the country at large. I see no problem with an adult coming home at the end of the day and enjoying a joint to chill out.

The main argument i seem to see crop up against legalisation is the psychological problems that can arise from heavy use. Cannabis itself cannot cause psychological problems, instead it can bring it to the surface earlier than it would. I actually had a friend who had a psychotic episode due to cannabis use, he had been having mental issues for a number of years and started using cannabis heavily to self medicate. He is perfectly fine now and actually still smokes cannabis it helps him to relax (he suffers from bi-polar disorder) he actually finds it helps him better than the pills the doctor gives him. These cases of cannabis causing severe mental health issues however are few and far between and there are plenty of cases of alcohol induced psychosis out there that go unreported. The only times when it would really be possible to cause issues was if cannabis is mixed with other strong drugs over a period of time and in those cases it is not the cannabis that is causing the problem.

I agree with what is said about keeping it to private places and cafes, i would not want it on the streets as it is a very very very strong smell and some people do not like it. Adults should be allowed to grow 4 plants at home for personal use and new business could arise with the government issuing permits to people to become licensed growers for coffee shops. The waste from cannabis plants could be reconstituted into compost for agriculture. Alongside cannabis the hemp industry would boom. Hemp per acre provides more paper than 4 acres of trees. I am not sure if hemp could grow outside in the UK so it would have to be grown in greenhouses so the whole hemp industry side of it is debatable if that is the case.

There are two different types of weed, sativa and indica.

Indica makes everything really thick and heavy feeling, not an uncomfortable heavy but just like really lazy and relaxed. You're body feels like it is glued to the couch and you can find yourself being zoned into the simplest of things for hours. You don't really think much but when you do you get lost in complex thought trails and when you snap out of it you wonder how you arrived at what you were thinking about.

Sativa makes everything very vivid and seem more colourful. Your senses feel heightened and your head feels very light. You will notice things you have never noticed before and be amazed by them such as the pores on your skin or something very insignificant like that. When you move it feels faster, not a wired kind of feeling but time feels slower but at the same time you feel faster. Sativas make you very talkative and giggly, you'll find yourself talking for hours with another person about life, the universe or any number of things like that or you'll just talk about how funny that movie was it depends really haha.

Butthurt that you aren't starting for one of the top clubs in all the world whilst taking a check every week? BE FUCKING BETTER. The lad is a professional, and a top quality footballer. Work harder, its that simple. Come early stay late, try to be the best you can be. We as Spurs fans know he is damn good, good enough to show starting in the first team; but, he hasnt done that yet. Is that our fault? Hell no bro, its his fault.

Its absurd to even try to contemplate the type of ego he has fashioned ever since his desire to play for Real Madrid overcame his desire to prove that he can be world class. At this point its hubris, and the date of the article (feb 8th, 2013) just highlights how wrong he is. Its not complacency, its not a lack of skill, its not a lack of form, its purely subjective and quite frankly a poor show of character.

He's already doing much better than Torres or Carroll did after their much more high profile transfers.  And, I expect him to hit his stride next year.  With Defoe hurt; and Ade possibly off form, possibly not motivated; we need all the goals we can get.  Sure Bale's been on fire for a couple games, but that won't last the rest of the season.  But, let's be honest, if we are going to meet our already high expectations, we need goals and goal scorers.

Sure, our defense is keeping teams to clean sheets or close, right now.  And, our keeper is on form.  Sure, Aaron Lennon can split open a defense with his eyes closed.  Moussa can dribble the ball, for the entirety of the pitch.  But, we need more goals.

I think Liverpool's most important targets this summer's transfer window will be primarily defensive players. We can't afford to offload any players in defense who have proven themselves to be even remotely passable as first team contenders.

Even though Skrtel has showed an apparent dip in form, if more centre backs are brought into the club they will be fighting for the spot, which will in turn make him fight harder for the spot. This will lead to overall increased competition for first team play which often spurs a rise in average form over periods of gameplay.

true,yk3313,present,Gianfranco  Zola,"None of these formations really suit the players I think...As of right now, I feel the diamond formation would be completely viable for us, albeit, a slightly wider diamond than Ancelotti's narrow one.

A dedicated defensive midfielder would solve most of our issues with transitioning defense to attack, and a rotating midfield three has already worked in the earlier part of the season as seen when Mazacar was controlling the tempo of games. 

Playing Frank together at the top with Ba or Torres could also work. He didn't do very well at the tip of the diamond, but being a poacher could be the next big thing in his career with his finishing.

Fluidity would definitely need to be this formations biggest asset, with the only player in the opponents half not running around the place trying to find pockets of space would be the defensive midfielder. 

I can only wish this could happen, but we all know that almost ALL the managers in today's game are very rigid in the way their team plays. The only team that really changes formations depending on the game would have to be United...and by god have they been a treat to watch...not only this season, but for many already.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"The competition thing is a decent point, but I'd say that's a point for *right now* - Skrtel has between now and the end of the season to prove to Rodgers that he can be the CB that Rodgers wants, showing greater leadership and composure under pressure and dealing with physical centre-forwards. Rodgers is looking for a reaction from Skrtel in the same way as he sought from Enrique, Downing &amp; Henderson, and if he doesn't get it before the end of this season, Skrtel goes. 

We know Rodgers has a degree of ruthlessness to him with transfers - see Sahin and Carroll. And in both those cases, I think Rodgers' ruthlessness was partly due to their wages, both of which were too high for a bench player. Similarly, I imagine the contract Skrtel just signed last summer puts his wages at the level you'd have for a first-XI CB; so when that player isn't a first XI CB, then his wages are also now too high for his place in the squad, and Rodgers might feel he can get a 3rd choice CB he has more faith in than Skrtel on lower wages too.

Also, if Skrtel hasn't reclaimed the first-XI spot by the end of the season, what reason does *he* have to stay here? There will be other clubs interested in him that will offer a first-team spot *and* CL football.

Serious answer: Evolution? They shouldn't be susceptible to infections on alien worlds because those bacteria and viruses aren't adapted to their systems. 

On Earth, at least for human companions, it might get a little more problematic. I'm guessing that some diseases of the past might actually be less dangerous because they haven't yet killed off many of their hosts and evolved more effective strains, while humans haven't developed stronger immunity to it. However, someone from the future would be descended from people who had survived, e.g., the Black Death, so might have stronger natural immunity to an earlier, more generalized form of the disease.

On the other hand... someone from now going back to 1910 might be completely susceptible to measles, TB, polio, small pox, etc. They might also have the same problem going forward, for the same reasons that they might survive a 700 year-old disease when going back.

So, except for the alien worlds idea, see my facetious answer, above.",0,1360392791,null,0,false,0,c8c1yu0,t3_186j8x,t1_c8c1yu0,t3_186j8x,null,1431238489,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I took the lead in the 17th when my leftmid headed in a cross from my rightmid, feeling good, they equalize 12 min later when my leftmid then decides to set up a perfect assist for their striker (he claims to have been trying to pass back to a CB, but it missed bad and their guy pounced on it to thunder in the goal). So it's halftime, still 1-1. I rage at my guys for not being in the lead, as I always do if we aren't dominating (I'm an angry manager, but it seems to motivate my squad well) 

Nothing much happens, until the 73rd min, where my wonderkid (21yo 2 time golden boot winner) has a moment of inspiration, and, off a long distance free kick, flicks the ball on with his head over the outstretched arms of the onrushing keeper, who helplessly watches it sail over him into the net. 2-1. It's close to 10 min now till game's end, so I'm feeling pretty confident, the fact that one of their CBs got red carded for a professional foul in the 81st (my other striker was 1 v 1 with their keepr, he took him out from behind) only increased that confidence. But lo and behold, what else could happen but in the 88th min Fellaini scores when he finds himself unmarked and on the receiving end of a cross in our box... So 10 man Atl. Madrid equalize, and the whistle for regulation time blows, it's on to OT, 2-2. 

Just to make things better, after blowing a lead to a 10man squad, Kayal, my defensive mid (and one of the only real people left on my team) gets a second yellow card and is sent off (he was somehow *shocked* when I fined him 1 weeks wage for that after the game, and started a fight with me over it, I was like, dude, we won the fucking champions league and you lose 1 weeks wages, which I think was pretty deserved, get over it lol) Oh yes, and than as their striker was dribbling in the corner of our penalty box, TWO of my CBs gang up on him, the first slide tackles and misses completely, the second defender takes his slide tackle and is dead on... to his legs, taking the guy out and giving them a penalty. (I wanted to throw my computer out the window, shit my pants, and die laughing all at once). I will my goalie on as much as I can (come on dude... you've played for me like 4 or 5 years now and I think you've only saved one penalty the entire time, time for you to step it up man), but alas it's for naught, he's rooted to the spot as some dude named Jorge (really, just Jorge, that's his whole name) slips it into the corner. So now all of a sudden I'm down 2-3 also with 10 men. Things are not looking good.

I use my last sub, putting on a third striker in a desperate attempt to equalize, but the minutes tick by, and to my depressed amazement, it looks like we are going to blow this game 3 times and lose. But then...

In the 121st minute, after all my hope has left and then some, as the whistle is seemingly on the linesman's lips, and you know if Ferguson was Madrid's manager he'd be screaming his lungs out for time, my substitute striker, a powerful but unrefined russian target man launches a shot in from close to 18 yards out.

GOAL! I don't believe it but we equalize seconds before the whistle blows, sending us to penalties!!!

In the end, they missed 2 of their first 3, and while one of my midfielders (who was actually supposed to be really good at penalties) blows his chance, it came down to my captain and team veteran Daniel Diallo. While normally a prolific striker, the fatigue of a full season in Europe + League must have really got to him, as he had been blowing every easy chance he could get his hands (or feet, I suppose) on for the past 3 weeks or so. I was sure this was a horrible omen that he was in line for the decisive shot, and had my head buried in my hands in anticipation. But somehow, somewhere, he pulled the last ounce of strength out of him and drilled a shot past their keeper (who, I've forgotten to point out, was their backup keeper, their regular having injured himself earlier, and yet somehow, we couldn't put any balls past this mediocre dude earlier in the game???) to give us the win!

Rodgers was already concerned that the team was too quiet, not having Carragher will make that even worse. The only leadership the team has now is Gerrard, and the only other loud and demanding player is Reain, although that seems more on the pitch rather than in the dressing room.

I hope Lucas can step up. I can't see Henderson doing it, his place isn't stable enough and he doesn't seem to have the personality. If not, we will need to buy a starting 11 player who has the leadership qualities that can replace what we lose with Carragher retiring. 

When watching matches in 08/09 season all you could hear on the television microphones was Carragher, Alonso, Reina and Gerrard shouting commands. Today the team is quiet, you can just hear small calls and no bossing around.

The major parties carry out no struggle against these fascists.

If Greece is the worst situation, it is not an abberation.  In Italy, Berlusconi is trying to white-wash Mussolini.  In Japan, Abe remembers the war-time regime fondly.  In the United States, the main parties barely stirred at a stolen election, and now have no qualms about destroying due process.

This isn't accidental.  Financial markets demand that governments around the world make cuts.  As we are on /r/unitedkingdom, let's use the local example: the coalition government are wielding the knife, but the opposition Labour party does not oppose the strategy of cuts - only the way they are carried out.  How can you have a democracy where the parliament is united against the people?

These domestic policies have a complement in the international arena.  Every state seeks to gain at the expense of its rivals.  While this currently takes place primarily in terms of finance, with competitive devaluation, war is simply politics by other means.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Let's have a quick run through their platform, although, as I stated above - with fascists, it's not what they say necessarily, but what they do once in power.  Socialist revolutionary rhetoric, but without any intention of carrying out revolutionary actions:

&gt; The ending of immigration to the UK 
&gt;
&gt;A massively-funded and permanent programme, using and doubling Britainâs current foreign aid budget â¦ to reduce, by voluntary resettlement to their lands of ethnic origin, the proportion of ethnic minorities living in Britain.
&gt;
&gt;The removal of all illegal immigrants
&gt;
&gt;The repeal of all equality and anti-discrimination legislation, including measures aimed at employing people with disabilities. 

All ""right-wing"", nationalist and/or racist policies.

&gt;Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the pursuit of protectionist economic measures. 

This one is a bit more unclear.  The withdrawal from the EU is undoubtedly much more popular on the right than the left in the UK, but there are definite factions on both sides which support this.  The left anti-EU faction is largely anti-corporate and anti ""free"" trade, and whilst that might be seen as fitting the ""protectionist economic measures"", it could simple be advocating for a return to mercantilist style parochially nationalist export-driven capitalism.

&gt;Encouraging greater share-ownership and worker co-operatives. 

Some socialist rhetoric here - ""worker cooperatives"" - but they are slippery beasts and the devil is in the detail.  Even the current Tory Party promotes coops, 2012 was the UN's international year of cooperatives, and it didn't appear to bring about a great deal of socialism.  The fact that they say ""worker cooperatives"" not ""worker-owned and controlled cooperatives"" is telling, as is the linking of it to ""share ownership"".  This looks like a broadly capitalist scheme, dressed up in vaguely leftish language.

&gt;Restricting foreign aid to the support of countries receiving ârepatriatedâ members of ethnic minorities. Griffin argued against giving unconditional foreign aid, including disaster aid, claiming âcharityâ is not an acceptable use of public funds

Again, a double-edged sword.  Foreign aid can be a form of soft power imperialism, or it can be to promote genuine development.  I think it's clear it serves the former purpose here.

&gt;The introduction of corporal punishment for petty criminals and vandals, and the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles and terrorists and its reintroduction for murderers. 

&gt;A mandatory jail term for anyone assaulting an NHS worker. 

Strongly right wing on law and order then?

&gt;The reintroduction of national service and the deprivation of some civil rights from conscientious objectors, including the right to vote. 

&gt;The requirement of all law-abiding adults completing national service to maintain a standard issue automatic rifle in their home. 

Strongly right wing on military service and militarism, anti-pacifist.  Indeed this is a major feature of all fascist parties, and is one of the reasons Heinlein's society in Starship Troopers was painted as fascist.  Gun control is a bit of a divisive issue, and I'm one of the few leftists I know who is pro-gun, but it's still a much more common feature of right wing thinking, many on the left are in favour of tighter gun control if anything.  Few would want to have ex military holding on to automatic rifles.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Well, I'm actually uncertain as to how this match will pan out - both in terms of Warnock's team selection and the result itself. One of two things will end today: Leeds' abysmal away form or Wolves' terrible form in general. My cynical self is telling me that Wolves will probably be well up for this game, as bottom teams generally are against Leeds, and Leeds simply won't be able to match them. However, today I'm going to put my faith in Leeds; if we can't get a result today then who are we going to get a result against? **2-1 to Leeds** - maybe Morison will even score the winner.

As for the team, it's a 50/50 toss-up between Warnock wanting to keep the same team and him wanting  to throw his new signings in. Last week Eddie Gray suggested playing McCormack and Morison up front with Diouf on the wing and having the central midfielders work to cover for Diouf's inability to track back. Personally, I would love to see Leeds go for a team like this, but it doesn't strike me as Warnock's style. Also, I will still be very disappointed if White is dropped, because he's still playing well, although it's merely a matter of time until Warnock replaces him.

For now, I'll predict him to start with the same team (and bring Morison off the bench):

Studying Shakespeare is actually surprisingly accessible, primarily because of its depth of artistic genius. You can read 10 lines of Shakespeare and write a whole essay on it, but even with other incredible authors, you just can't do that. That's not to say other authors shouldn't be studied, but as far as analysis goes, it's easier to write about something when it's written at a higher standard, and that rule extends right to the top (i.e, Shakespeare).

There is also the simple fact that Shakespeare has been studied so extensively that it enables students to take in different interpretations of a work and get a wide range of analysis from different perspectives. 

Personally I don't think 2 plays is studying Shakespeare much at all. You could study Lear and Hamlet and you'd have arguably 2 of the top 10 greatest literary works ever written, and you would never run out of original insight on either of them after years of study.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"Now I resubmitted this without editorialising the title because I think that its a marvellous piece of journalism exposing a fantastic ostrich effect in the Telegraph (and by extension, the right-wing libertarian school of economics) office.

So as the article says, we're currently pissing away money. The national debt has grown (but in typical telegraph fashion, doesnt say that one of the largest causes of that is the massive expenditure on welfare because people are out of work) contrary to what we were promised - indeed [using this as a source](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_national_debt) the national debt for 2012 will be 40% larger than that for 2010. Additionally to this, overall the two years of liberalising reforms aimed at making Britain attractive to business hasnt really helped a great deal because it still fails to address the principal fault in our economy which is a crushing lack of demand due to suppressed wages and costs of living that are rising at an extortionate pace.

Instead, we get this article whose recommendations are pretty laughable.

&gt;The Chancellor must commit to an ambitious new plan for growth. The singular emphasis on austerity has been both defeatist and misleading. 

But!

&gt;We are not suggesting that Mr Osborne waters down his deficit reduction strategy. On the contrary, he should make more ambitious cuts.

And then this stunning bit of economics:

&gt;With the economy stubbornly refusing to move and with confidence low, bold measures are needed. To begin with, he should accelerate the cut in corporation tax that is already under way. Mr Osborne wants to reduce the tax gradually to 21 per cent. **He should instead bring it down to below the level in Ireland, where it is 12.5 per cent. Overnight, this would make the UK the most attractive location in the EU** in which to invest and do business, and it would be consistent with the steps the Coalition has already taken to make the country one of the best places in the world to start a new business. Such a significant reduction could be accompanied by the removal of exemptions, subsidies and special deals that businesses currently enjoy. **Extra growth would compensate the Treasury for the up-front tax hit.**

Which is the very fucking worst kind of voodoo economics, completely leaving out the massive gap in revenue and expenditure that would result, causing us to *borrow even more* to make up the shortfall until (if it ever happens, that is) we get enough revenue to make up the difference between 21 and 12.5%.

&gt;The Chancellor should also consider abolishing capital gains tax (CGT), currently levied at 28 per cent, which raises less than Â£5 billion a year but which requires a host of rules and regulations to prevent avoidance. This would infuriate the Left, but CGT reduces the incentive to invest at a time when it is badly needed. Entrepreneurship and risk-taking should be encouraged, not throttled. These measures would have a positive impact on the stock market, boosting shares and helping pension funds recover some of the value they have lost since the 2008 crash. They would help revive the basic ingredient of any recovery: confidence. Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, has warned that a strategy based mainly around the rhetoric of austerity entrenches pessimism. **Mr Osborne could, at a stroke, transform the fortunes of both the economy and the Conservative Party.**

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Well, in a sense, that's kind of what I'm saying.  There can be more than one reason to introduce a particular policy measure, when you're talking within the boundaries of ""liberal democratic"" politics, which is one of the reasons it never fucking goes anywhere, whichever party of the supposed left or supposed right you vote into office.  All of the major parties, and I'd suggest, even the BNP, are basically neo-liberal or at most Keynesian capitalist parties.  Revolutionary socialism or even democratic socialism aren't really on the agenda.

Immigration politics has got a bit jumbled up, principally due to neo-liberal globalisation and ""free"" trade, and the increasing tendency of transnational corporations to lose their parochial loyalties to their country of incorporation and the global elite to lose their loyalties to their countries of birth.  Over the last few decades that has led to unprecedented economic migration, which has put pressure on developed nations' welfare states and services.  

But in a deeper historical sense, at least up until the World Wars and in many ways far beyond it, free movement of working people and internationalism were leftist causes.  They continue to be so for many on the left, but, in the face of globalisation, there is a significant contingent who believe regional working class interests need to be protected against neo-liberal policies.  Many of us believe the problem remains with the neo-liberal policies and globalisation itself.  

This dynamic will shift again as the global elite and transnational corporations increasingly abandon the West as it becomes not only more profitable to produce in developing countries whose infrastructures have been prepared by corporate welfare from the Western working class, but also more profitable to market and sell there as the consuming class and markets there expand.

&gt;I do not think strong on law and order is right wing

Here we just disagree but...

&gt;extreme leftists (stalin/mao/khymer rouge) were all very keen on severe penaltys, the last labour government created many new offences.

The reason is that I see all these groups as broadly conservative.  Stalin was the most conservative leader the USSR threw up.  He was no leftist.  Even Lenin and the October coup were right wing deviations from the February revolution's libertarian roots, and ultimately many of the libertarian/leftist Marxists and anarchists were driven out or killed during and after the civil war.  

I'm less well-read and/or interested in Mao, but Chinese society has pretty much always been fairly authoritarian in most places and at most times.  The Khmer Rogue were a bunch of primitivists who would have been a marginal footnote in history had the US not brought them to power and the US and UK not ultimately kept them hanging in there.  But yes, all these groups had pretty terrible justice systems and human rights records.  I'm not sure how well that translates to tough law and order being left wing though?

* Parker's looking amazing. Great technique, too, I remember him being a bit woodier.

* Holtby really is something. I sort of felt people were overrating him a bit, partly because of his enthusiasm and the fact he was our only signing. I am now able to confirm that Lewis is, indeed, football's Jesus Christ. Such a creative little fucker. Here's hoping he can heal Hurricane Sandro, who could become Jesus' Bodyguard in the midfield.

* This hierarchy establishes Gareth Bale as the God of Football, which might mean Holtby and Bale are the same person. It would explain the flourishing bromance we seem to be witnessing. The math works out.

* Dempsey's having less impact on the game than a Geordie detonating a wet fart in the guest stands. This means he will probably score in the second half.

* Newcastle/France jokes will expire very soon, just a heads up. 

* Bale is playing ST, LM, RM and CAM. This is gangsta as fuck. Meanwhile, Dempsey's flopping around like a headless chicken and is doing his best to try not to run into the post. Good on him! He's doing some of his best Not-Running-Into-The-Post work he's done this season.

* I haven't looked at precise stats, but we've had about six-seven hundred corner kicks in this half. Like half a thousand more and we might convert one of them into a goal!

* Ref is pretty good. Allows a lot of contact. Dembele force-waltzing motherfuckers left right and center is a good sight.

The main feature for logging in is a 'planning' tool. You choose a couple of your Facebook friends - it sends them a notification. On the 'plan' page we show a list of days and areas. People can then select the days they are up for meeting. You can also find and search for local offers and events and suggest them into the plan.

The map is a good idea. Difficult to get right on mobiles/tablets - but we'll look at adding something.

The venues are sorted by an internal quality score. At the moment it's made up of factors like the offers and events they have on, and if they have address / contact details. The list can be filtered based on area, type, etc. If you are in a 'plan' then the list of venues is further sorted by what we think is relevant to your plans (i.e. the days you may be wanting to go out / the areas).

The information is hand-edited from a basic data source. We've built some tools to help us do this - and try to source information from other free/open data sources. We want to try and open this up so people can suggest modifications. 

Our venue list isn't totally complete - I'll find out why Bramble has disappeared! 

The Paypal logo is there as you are required to have it if you accept Paypal payments. We are just about to launch a tool for restaurants to run their own pre-paid coupons and deals using Paypal.

He's much more of a reactionary defender that can stop plays if they're clearly panned out in front of him (like Shawcross, Samba, Cahill), but struggles with more subtle counter-attacks or pressing. He also isn't fantastic with the ball at his feet, but he is definitely improving in this regard. He also seems to be completely wrecked by forwards who employ the ""Dark Arts"" of football because it just feels like he lacks the awareness to counter that sort of subtlety. Against Arsenal and City you could see why Carragher started as Arsenal build up with great amounts of interplay and require proactive defending and interceptions, while City counter with pace and intelligent passing. 

That being said, he's extremely strong and powerful, and probably the best header of the ball on the team at the moment.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't understand why there is a continued focus on classic works of literature when so many people who go through English GCSE courses are not adept at *using* the English language. Reading the 'greats' is certainly interesting and potentially valuable for those who are already more able, but despite the common sentimental attachment to the idea that reading Shakespeare is what studying English is all about, literary criticism is unquestionably a less useful skill than the ability to communicate proficiently.

I see a lot of posts here about modernising the reading list, but I feel like they're missing the point. I think concerns over the particular works of fiction which are studied should always be a distant second to concerns over the strength of the verbal and written communication skills students have. The vast majority of students will not be hampered in later life by an inability to determine a character's motivation in a play, but they *will* be hampered by an inability to use correct spelling and grammar in many different types of written communication they use as adults.

To anticipate a criticism, it's not that I think reading fiction isn't valuable. If possible, I think it's an excellent idea to encourage young people to read, and they can get a lot out of it if they are genuinely invested in it. But let's not glorify fiction too much. It's an entertainment medium, and as such treating it as an essential component of education when other basic skills aren't taught well enough indicates a poor choice of priorities. If people aren't reading for pleasure by the time they reach the age of 14, it is unlikely that they will do so due to exposure to more literature at GCSE level, and they would be much better served by being taught how to write effective, functional documents than literary criticism.

TLDR: Classic literature, regardless of time period, shouldn't be a priority when so many people can't write well. Reading for pleasure shouldn't be forced on kids if they haven't taken to it by the time they're 14, especially if they're missing more important skills.",0,1360420034,null,0,false,0,c8c523x,t3_186stz,t1_c8c523x,t3_186stz,null,1431239951,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

**Head-to-head**

â¢	Leeds kicked off this season with a 1-0 win over Wolves, courtesy of a diving header from Luciano Becchio. It ended a series of three 1-0 league victories by Wolves over the Whites.

â¢	Leeds are now targeting a first league double in 29 years over the black-country club.

â¢	The first goal scored in this match will be the 200th on display in league clashes between the clubs.

**Wolverhampton Wanderers**

â¢	Wolves lie in their lowest position of the season, immediately above the relegation zone with a two-point cushion, winless in seven and without a point in two.

â¢	They're making a fifth attempt to gain a first victory under Dean Saunders, but remain at the foot of the Championship's ""form"" table, with two points out of 18.

â¢	Christophe Berra is on the verge of his 300th club career appearance.

**Leeds United**

â¢	If Leeds are to retain their top-half status, they'll need to end a four-match losing league run away from home and pick a first point on the road since their 4-2 victory at Huddersfield on 1 December.

â¢	Neil Warnock's side are on the longest current run without a draw 
in the Championship of 15 games.

Just my opinion, anyway.

Personally I think it will be 4-4-2 with Green and Varney on the wings and a front two of McCormack and Morison, but we'll have to see.

Am I the only one appalled by Warnock's starting XI, by the way? There is not a **single** player in our midfield who can pass the ball. In fact, McCormack is the only player who can pass the ball out of our midfielders and forwards. Why not play Barkley, who hasn't been played in his natural position once? Why not play Tonge, who actually can pass the ball and would fit in with the team? Why drop White, who hasn't put a foot wrong in the last two games?

To do this they abseil down the cliff, as I mentioned before, not everyone makes it to the bottom. Also access to the beach in the area is infrequent, meaning it's quicker and easier to go over the cliff than walk round and carry a casualty out. 

Cliff rescues are dangerous. More so than the activities you mention.

We have Daniel Levy as a chairman, who would surely place a price tag on Bale somewhere around the Â£50-60m mark, would stick to it, and wouldn't sell to other teams in the league.

This likely leaves Real Madrid and Barcelona (assuming you count out teams like PSG and Anzhi) who would likely be against paying such a massive fee for a player when they already have such strong teams.

Now we all know how easily things can change in football, and we can assume very little. But I'm not worried.

2) Horse meat is more expensive than beef, so it doesn't take a genius to realise that this horsemeat isn't the same as that horsemeat, because that'd be the worst business plan in the world. This horsemeat must be the stuff they can't sell as horsemeat elsewhere. Why would that be? It's because racing horses, in particular, are sometimes rammed full of steroids which are known to be very harmful to humans, including being carcinogenic. This horse meat is banned and, as a consequence, it is completely worthless - hence, it's now cheaper than beef. This is likely what has been secretly making its way into your food and children's food - all to drive up profits.

When Tolkein wrote it he was only interested in creating a detailed account of events that took place in a fictional universe he created. There are pages and pages of songs and poems in *fictional languages* with *no fucking translation* to go with them. Important character development and backstory is included in the *appendices* (not even sequels). Characters continuously talk about other characters, places and events which aren't relevant to the plot. Important narrative moments are skimmed over quickly and described in *hindsight* - not even attempting to build up tension and bring it to a climax... The list goes on and on.

1.  It's actually supposed to be weathering to indicate a subplot of some sort. Perhaps more time passes for the Doctor in this episode than what we see, maybe he's done a lot of traveling that we aren't aware of between the first appearance and the second.

2. It's supposed to be frost. The Tardis is sitting in a cloud after all, and at that altitude things frost over. The only problem with this idea is it really doesn't look like frost. [1](http://i.imgur.com/GWpJmUX.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/ccXphpi.png) It really does look like it's more weathered and beat up to me. The only shot that I saw which could plausibly look like frost to me is the first shot you posted, which was CG and had far less detail in the show  than the up close practical shots. 

3. It's just a visual storytelling device.  Perhaps they're trying to tie the Tardis' appearance to reflect an aspect of the Doctor's, maybe his state of mind. When we first see him he's tired and worn out of his old save-the-day routine, and then he meets Clara and starts acting more like his old self. In the second shot he's back to his old self, his personality metaphorically lights up while the Tardis' interior literally lights up.

Plenty of people with disabilities don't get DLA either because their disability doesn't really cause extra financial costs, or they're the wrong kind of costs, or because they can't get through the application process (often partly because of their disability). That doesn't mean they aren't entitled to other benefits.

One of the ""great"" things about the benefit system - just being able to prove you need benefits isn't enough. You need superior abilities in order to navigate the benefit system and identify which benefits you might be entitled to, and to get through the claims process. Unclaimed and underpayed benefits far outweigh losses due to fraud etc, and people have been known to be forced into fraud out of desperation even though they were entitled to more benefits (of a different kind) than the ones they fraudulently claimed. When this is discovered, the system reacts with empathy and compassion... HA HA HA HA!!!

BTW - DLA is being phased out over the next few years.

I am expecting the next few weeks to show some seriously disturbing results in relation to our food. 

Considering it's harder and more expensive to raise horses, and the relative rarity of horses nowadays, it doesn't really make sense that they can supply enough meat for factory lines either, it can't all be horse meat. 

I find it difficult to believe that factories are unaware of the meat that is used in their food also, either they're lying or they have such disregard for their products that it should be classed as illegal. 

This whole situation is like looking into a very deep dark pit, and there is going to be some seriously horrible discoveries made the deeper you go.
However, it might make the FSA stop banning safe products and actually do something useful for a change, and why the hell aren't try testing this stuff already?!

Until Bale starts whining in interviews that he wants to go elsewhere, I will not worry. I think as fans we can tell that Gareth feels a connection to our club that Modric never did. Spurs gave Bale his chance and stuck with him even during his massive struggles early in his career. I am not saying that he feels that he owes a debt to the club, but rather, his connection to Spurs is derived from loyalty and love. Money is great, and Gareth is very well payed. I think that someday, yes, he will move on to a place like Real Madrid (which he has respectfully said would be a dream). 

His ""dream"" of playing there had no timetable, however. Champions League football and Gareth will be here next season. I have no doubt about it.

I agree, and it was sort of the point of my post that we need more to separate the top grades.

I've never seen any evidence that someone who has a C or D grade should score lower, only that too many people achieve As and A stars. The solution isn't to make it harder for those legitimately getting Ds and Cs, who really need the benefits of modular teaching and core exam scales, but to engage the top end on its own.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Well now, this will leave Neil Warnock torn. His two very favourite players in the whole world cocked up respectively for both Wolves' goals. Leeds were their own worst enemy and threw the win away. But will he dare to criticise Kenny and Peltier, two players he simply refuses to drop? I doubt it - he'll probably contrive a way to punish Lees for the goals.

What I hate about Warnock's Leeds United is just how predictable they are. We have thrown away a valuable win, and in spite of individual errors I can only blame Neil Warnock. Leeds have lost as a result of two things they've been doing all season:

* Sitting back when they take the lead.

* Not bringing substitutes on when they need them.

When you look at a lot of Championship sides this season, they take the lead and then push on for another (and another, and another) so that the win can be secured. When you look at Leeds United this season, we often take the lead and immediately sit back, trying to defend and kill the game off despite the fact that we only very rarely keep a clean sheet.

However, if we **are** trying to do that and grind out the result, why not make a defensive change, such as bringing Pearce on? I believe that's what he tried to do, just before Wolves equalised. But by then it was far, far too late and Warnock has been frequently guilty of shutting the door after the horse has bolted with his substitutions. In the end he brought Barkley on and wasted time with *that* substitution when we were trying to get back in the lead with two minutes to go, rather than making it with five minutes to go when we had the lead and should have been trying to waste time and kill the game.

I bet that none of these points get touched on in Warnock's post-match interview, anyway. He'll just say that his team were **so** unlucky and that he ""couldn't have asked for anymore from the lads.""",0,1360430094,null,0,false,0,c8c764b,t3_186y2q,t1_c8c764b,t3_186y2q,null,1431240939,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

One of the main reasons I suggest adding in a section for books which may be more relevant to students' lives is that one of the aims of the course, and the second stated objective, is to encourage reading for pleasure - and lots of people engage poorly with a these older texts.

My problem isn't buying prospects, I understand the rationale. It's more of how we use our youth talent. If that makes sense.

In the past two years we've put a lot of money into our reserves in academy. We add prospects, which I'm fine with, but I don't feel like the club is using the more mature young players (De Bruyne, Bruma, van Aanholt, and Kakuta come to mind).

While Bertrand is a good example of a youth system product (I think he did most of his youth training at Gillingham, though), the only other example of this on our squad Nathan Ake.

As far as selling youth players for profit goes, Sturridge was sold for profit but wasn't a youth product - we purchased him from MCFC. I can't think of many other examples.

So to clarify, I like that we're buying prospects. I just feel like we have promising youth in a promising youth system, but we're not getting the bang for our buck - so to speak.",0,1360435312,null,0,false,0,c8c8kpe,t3_1872jk,t1_c8c8kpe,t1_c8c759y,null,1431241602,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

If playing with an odd number if people, then the amount of angels could not outnumber the humans.

The ""seeing an angel freezes them"" rule only counts if the human has obviously turned round and is point blank staring at them - a short glance over the shoulder doesn't count, as that's where arguments start.

This is a fine position to hold but ONLY towards the mentally healthy. I have absolutely no issue against this position towards a person facing a terminal disease that is going to end with weeks of horrible horrible suffering. When it comes to a person's mindset in depression though? They are not themselves, they are not of sound judgement, they will not think the same if they did not have their mental illness.

The fact that you're fighting it on and off I think only reinforces my point, you defend them because you defend yourself too, the problem is that I don't believe that you're of complete sound mind. Once you've escaped the cycle completely I'm 100% sure you'll entirely agree with me, as has any other person I've met that's struggled with depression and finally managed to escape it's clutches.

It's like a fog lifts and you become able to see things with complete clarity again. The mental illness of depression makes you not yourself, for years, when you finally escape it and look back you become ridiculously thankful you either failed at any attempts to end your life or thankful that you never managed to work up the courage.

You are most likely a slave to fox news and hinge your opinion on the every word of Glenn Beck and other like minded maniacs. Let me give you a lesson in crime. Crimes are committed in most part by the poorest in society as they become desperate and need to get by. The reason black people are involved in a lot of crime in America is because they were thrown in inner city projects and left with nothing and expected to fend for themselves. If you leave generations of people in the same perpetually bad area, crime will breed and crime will become ingrained in that part of society. This is not exclusive to race. In Scotland, my country of birth there are places called 'schemes'
These are areas filled with low quality houses, no prospects and poor families. This is where most of the violent crime in the country is bred. All by white people funnily enough. The reason? because these people have no prospects and have been left to fend for themselves by the government, no job prospects, no community outreach programs, nothing.
Don't try and tell me that specific races commit certain crimes because your claims have absolutely zero scientific evidence to support them.

At Manchester United from 18 to 24, and then went into the starting line up at Real Madrid. It wasn't until the 06-07 season that Ronaldo broke double digits for goals, his fourth season playing regularly for United. He still played for Manchester for another three seasons. 

And this is Christiano Ronaldo, the guy who, if not for Messi, would probably have 3 ballon d'ors at this point.

I believe that Bale will stick with us until he feels he is good enough to have an impact at a larger club. He has seen what has happened to Modric, and I'm sure has no interest in becoming a squad player as he begins to enters his best years. In reality, he has only really had 2 great seasons with us, this being his third, and probably best overall.

Being in Scotland I can't say much about the teaching of him in England, and possibly it is miles ahead of us in this area, but comparing my experience at high school with my experience in a literature course I can see a total discrepancy. Shakespeare was not made vivid, active, useful, in high school and we were just supposed to marvel at his brilliance with no real time spent working out why he was brilliant. It doesn't take much, just a few considerations.

1) Metre; why it's important for the formation of Shakespeares lines and what his poetry does for drama.
2) Performance; how the play has been performed over the years and what each of these performances can bring to particular play texts.
3) Historical significance; both in terms of where he stands in relation to the rest of English literature and what the plays can tell us about the world in which they were written.

Through a study of these three features, the tools could be provided with which a student could approach any work of literature and analyse it with fluency. 

Instead, in focussing on the quantity of Shakespeare rather than teaching an appreciation of his qualities and importance, the teaching of Shakespeare seems a relic of a by-gone age where he was relevant.

My main gripe was that in the January period we had a squad bogged down with injury, suspension, tired legs, and international duty. Most of our players looked exhausted. Personally, I felt that even though many of our players on loan might not have been good enough to be in the starting 11 week in and week out they could at least serve as rotation players until tired players were less so.

But, this is why I play FM13 and am not managing a club in real life.

Regardless, enjoyed the banter. Always like discussing our youth. I think we can both agree that we have a boatload of talent, and that hopefully they mature well.

It's definitely the without asking that's more of a problem - if there's space and you've asked, I have no problem with someone using that space but I often put the bin out the night before, and put an extra bag in in the morning before the binmen come to make optimal use of a collection. If I can't do that because someone has filled it without asking, it's really frustrating and rude.

true,das_garry,english,South West,"It's a bad idea. I say this as someone who loves Shakespeare's work. I could have quite happily studied 3/4 of Shakespeare's plays at GCSE but when it came to reading Of Mice and Men, analysing poetry and An Inspector Calls I very nearly went mad.

Rather than studying a small group of the same books, couldn't teachers choose interesting books from unspecificed genres? For my German A level exam we have to choose a book and are then tasked with an essay with a general question - explain why a certain character advances the plot, for example. Why couldn't this be implemented into English? Currently, coursework allows this to a certain extent; for our pre-1914 novel our class covered Dickens' A Christmas Carol - but it's not open-ended enough in my opinion.

Just because something's brilliant doesn't mean it's for everyone. A lot of people argue that Shakespeare is not relevant - well, it is. They handle themes of love, death, loss, triumph and betrayal, and if as a teenager you can't empathise with any of those concepts then I don't know what planet you've been living on. It's the teaching. There are very few excellent English teachers and even the best get lumped with difficult students who just don't want to learn.

I always wanted more scope for original writing when I did my GCSEs. Especially stories. What's the point in being able to pick apart someone else's writing critically if you can't write yourself? The other thing I notice in my classmates at A-level - all of them intelligent and with many years of experience at writing - is that they can only really write within a framework of an exam/coursework essay. Ask a good majority of them to write about something at length and they couldn't.

&gt;Nazi â an insult in use long before the rise of Adolf Hitler's party. It was a derogatory term for a backwards peasant â being a shortened version of Ignatius, a common name in Bavaria, the area from which the Nazis emerged. Opponents seized on this and shortened the party's title Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, to the dismissive ""Nazi""

As I just showed, the term, while existingbefore Hitler's rise to power, existed before its use as a backwards peasant. World War 1 is before 1924, which is the first use of Nazi refering to a country bumbkin. 

Also:

&gt;An older use of Nazi for national-sozial is attested in German from 1903

Again, 1903 is before 1924. Get it now?

How was I being selective? Who cares if people outside of Germany popularized the word Nazi -- it is irrelevant. The only relevant thing is how Hitler himself thought of the term Nazi, who lives inside of Germany, not in England. Why don't you tell me how the Inuit thought of the Nazis, too? That is just as relevant to your last point. 

Also, what is a 'despite word' in German. The English text makes no sense, and your explanation makes no sense either.

I personally found the coursework easy, had pretty much full marks on the essays. But I found writing under time pressure in the exam, especially creative writing or literature was difficult. 

All comes down to practice ultimately, even if you're not naturally good at it you can probably 'train' enough to get a decent grade in the exam which is the most important thing as English Lang is the most important GCSE.

As for what you get you will most probably get tutoring and then depending on the severity of your dyslexia; A scribe for exams, use of a computer for exams, a laptop and other stuff such as a printer, scanner, dictaphone. 

You won't get asked trick questions, I think what you are referring to is the process for those people trying to claim for welfare benefits, this is entirely separate.

We don't lose a lot, yet we don't win a lot, and it made me realize that there is something wrong with the 3/1/0 point system. 

If you win, you get the 3 points. If you lose, you get nothing. So if you tie, which is pretty much the middle point of winning and losing, you only get 1 point instead of 1.5 points. This means that tying is closer to losing than to winning. 

We have tied 7 times in the league so far! United have only tied twice. Had we won those 5 extra games we would have ten more points, and be in second place with only 3 points away from them. 

Last year both Manchester clubs only had 5 ties in the whole season! Did they deserve more? Probably, but they managed a measly little goal at the end of the game and won 1-0 or 2-1 instead of tying 1-1 or 0-0. 

The last 3 times we won the league we only had 5, 4, and 8 ties.
