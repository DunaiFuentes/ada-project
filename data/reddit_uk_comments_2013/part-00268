Hypothetical Plot #1) (Aww, come on, you know you want to read it)

Out of lives (on his 13th regeneration), Matt Smith arrives at Trenzalore, to find something that grants extra regenerations. However, once there, he has to fight a widower Metacrisis Doctor for it (his 12th regeneration he abandoned in that other universe who has no regenerations, and is still bitter and warlike, as he still thinks he destroyed Gallifrey and is how he was 'before Rose met him'). (Reminder of who the 'Metacrisis Doctor' is: http://www.doctorwhoreviews.co.uk/2008-13_files/Journey's%20End%20(4).jpg)

Smith Wins, but dies in the process, becoming Capaldi. Metacrisis Doctor goes mad upon losing for some reason, is asked who he is (""Doctor Who?""), and in response, dubs himself ""The Valeyard"". He then goes back in the Doctor's timeline to get revenge, trying first to kill him after he's already 'spawned' the Valeyard regeneration, then going back even further and trying to steal his other self's regenerations, resulting in this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2INBe_qZFo

Valeyard becomes new villain, founds the Silence, and threatens to destroy the universe. Finding out that the Valeyard (who is ""The Doctor""), all of the Doctor's enemies form an alliance to trap him in the ""Pandorica"" in order to save the universe from HIM (they just have which Doctor is responsible a little wrong).

That plan fails, and the Alliance (Daleks Included) don't give up, track him to Trenzalore, where it becomes clear who the REAL threat to the universe is. The Doctor leads them into a 'giant battle amongst millions' against the Valeyard

true,ShittyTeam,logo,,"Ya, I agree he could play all those positions well. However I do think Yaya and Fernandinho both play the complete deep-lying midfielder, not sure what the terminology is here(maybe double pivot), better than Milner. That leaves Nasri, Silva, Negredo or Aguero for him to replace from the starting line up. Replacing Nasri or Silva is pretty hard as they are both better at retaining possession and take turns floating into the midfield or dropping back, they're both crucial to getting at opening up the field when we retrieve possession. 

He isn't going to start over Aguero, so that leaves starting Aguero up top alone and Negredo on the bench, requires him to either float around with Nasri and Silva or sit on the left or right and shift Fernandinho or Yaya in a wider role where neither are nearly as effective. The problem with playing the #10 role is it highlights Milner's less impressive abilities, his final pass, first touch and finish.

However his attitude means he is going to be a much bigger squad player than most people in his situation ever would be. He has to be the most improved player in the squad over the past 3 years. It's great because he consistently challenges Nasri for a spot in the squad which makes Nasri more focused knowing if he has a poor spell Milner will replace him. Also as Yaya gets older I think Garcia/Barry with Fernandinho and Milner in front of him will become more popular.

TL;DR Milner is great, but it's hard to get him on a best starting 11 while keeping our other players in their optimal roles.

Edit: Just wanted to add Milner has been outstanding this season in more of a Navas style winger on the left, something I did not think he would be able to replicate on that side of the field.",0,1386752930,null,0,1386753127,0,cdz0zl0,t3_1skw71,t1_cdz0zl0,t1_cdyl74q,null,1428273250,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1
true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Llrois is obviously our best best goalkeeper.

Defensively Walker and Vertonghen are the two who deserve to be the first names in the starting lineup in the back four. Rose, when healthy, wins leftback by default. As for the other CB, a case can be made for the other three. I like Chiriches, but not necessarily when paired up with Vertonghen. Both are very mobile and tend to get forward, which can leave us a bit exposed. Dawson is a great leader, but the least skilled of all of our CBs. In a perfect world, Kaboul would be healthy enough to form a consistent partnership with Vertonghen and one of the best in the league, but it seems like that might not happen.

The midfield is where we have a million options. Dembele and Paulinho have been our best and both are equally capable defensively, on the ball and going forward. However, Sandro and Capoue have both been very good when fit and one of them holding down the midfield would allow one of Dembele and Paulinho to have more freedom. We could play three of these four against a side that has a weak midfield, in order to dominate possession and consistently win the ball back. I wouldn't be surprised to see this against Liverpool.

However, putting Eriksen or Holtby in front of them allows us to inject some creativity into the side and increases our ability to create chances. Both of them are very good on the ball, a threat from set pieces and shooting from distance, while being good distributors of the ball. I personally prefer this set up in most cases.

As for the wingers, again, there's plenty of options to choose from. I like to break it down to Lamela or Lennon on the right and Sigurdsson, Townsend or Chadli on the left. Lennon is not only useless on the left, but incredibly effective on the right with his partnership with Walker. They both provide pace and the ability to send balls in, while understanding each other's games. Lamela should be able to secure a consistent starting spot before too long though, because he is arguably one of the best prospects in the game right now. He is technically brilliant and once his communication and decision making improve, he will be able to tear this league apart. On the left, we have three very different players. In Sigurdsson, we have a true number 10 who has been forced out wide, meaning that he provides us with everything that Eriksen and Holtby can offer, but lacks the pace of a true winger. Townsend is a true winger who is a bit selfish, but is capable of using two feet and has all of the pace in the world. Chadli is huge and skilled and powerful, he can play across the front three, but we seem to only use him on the left. I personally don't think we can go wrong with any of these three and should rotate them as necessary.

Soldado is our striker. He is a proven goalscorer and his style of play doesn't need to adjust to new leagues. He gets into dangerous positions in the box, gets the ball and puts it into the back of the net. It doesn't matter if he is in Spain, England, Italy, France or Germany; he can score. The problem has been everybody else. Luckily, that service seems to be increasing, but Defoe has been the one on the pitch. If we continue to use Lennon/Walker on the right, I'd certainly expect Soldado's scoring to increase. He would have definitely put away a couple of those chances in the Sunderland game. As for Adebayor, if he ever comes back, it will simply be down to his attitude. He can either be a top striker or a washed up mercenary, we've seen both from him. 

Basically, I don't think we have a strongest 11. Between injuries, considering who we are playing and a few guys still in the process of reaching their full potential, it is difficult to choose.

The most relevant programme for the UK is [Tempora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora).

Virtually everything you do online is recorded and stored for 3 days (meta-data for 30). It is then passed to the US where 850,000 people are allowed to access it.

Once in the US, if your data was encrypted then it will be [kept forever](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/20/leaked-nsa-doc-says-it-can-collect-and-keep-your-encrypted-data-as-long-as-it-takes-to-crack-it/).

&gt;You remember when the Telegraph released the expenses scandal? It was front page news of every newspaper for weeks and weeks. The NSA stuff makes the front page of other newspapers now and then, but nowhere near to the same extent as the expenses stuff.

The lack of coverage in the UK is primarily because there is a DA Notice in place regarding Tempora and PRISM. The Guardian has chosen to break that notice, other UK media outlets have chosen to abide by it.

&gt; Data which I may have thought was only accessible to the private companies who sell it to their various partners and clients, is also sold the government and kept on another server somewhere. I just don't care. Maybe I should care more, but I and most people don't.

The issue is less that your data has been sold, and more that it was unilaterally taken. At no point was this programme discussed or voted for - it was simply imposed, with no discussion over if it is a proportionate response. Terrorists existed in the 1960s and they talked to each other over landline phones. We didn't tape everyone's phone calls, ""just in case"".

About 30 years ago the [Stasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi) operated a surveillance programme on their own citizens that was very similar in character but limited by technology. That had a terribly corrosive influence on their society.

While our technology is far beyond that now there is no reason to think that human psychology has changed in 30 years. Nobody thinks they have done anything wrong/interesting, and therefore they have nothing to worry about. When someone is subject to the focus of the state, everyone assumes the state must be correct.

Would be interesting to see statistics relating to ""gypsy"" crime compared to crime in the wider population. Had a quick google but doesn't look like the sort of thing that the police make any distinctions for. Even then, I doubt numbers like those would make a difference to people's prejudices. (Or maybe they would just reinforce the stereotypes if they did show a higher rate of crime - even so, would that just be because those crimes are more easily detected, or more police focus on travellers?)

&gt;The Bill of Rights of 1688 made it clear that Parliament considered that there was a right for citizens to have arms and by the mid 18th century the Common Law was very clear in recognising a constitutional right to have arms which Parliament had no authority to breach in general terms.


 
&gt;Debates in Parliament made it clear that the Government accepted that there was indeed a right to keep arms but their view was that the Constitution allowed for qualification of that right for a limited period and in specific areas.


 
&gt;Until the start of the 20th century, therefore, the right to keep arms was vigorously upheld by Parliament and all attempts at legislation to restrict arms generally or firearms in particular failed completely.


&gt;That aspect of the American Constitution which relates to the right to keep arms is, in fact, no more than a modification of the English Common Law at the time of the American Revolution, the major difference being that the Americans created a written constitution largely because the British has ignored the rights of the colonists, not least in respect of their keeping of arms.",0,1386756998,null,0,false,0,cdz1n3h,t3_1sjffe,t1_cdz1n3h,t1_cdz1fgh,null,1428272945,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Football violence has been severely clamped down on with harsh sentences and lengthy bans, along with massive police presences at most games. You see dozens of police at match day, you don't see dozens of police at travelers camps.

Multinationals pay all the tax they're legally obliged to, they're not breaking any laws. That's different from just not paying tax illegally.

Muggings and thefts? The fact that there tends to be spikes in criminal behaviour when a camp is set up means that they're far far more likely to endulge in criminal behaviour than the general population (otherwise a 100 or so in a population of 10,000s would have no measurable impact). 

And of course, if they are suspected of crimes, the camp can just move on, leaving the police largely unable to find them and prosecute them.

With that previous point and your point about drunk/homelessness. Few people like either of those things. Just because they already exist, that doesn't mean people are happy that a group is coming that adds to those problems. Why should we as a country be happy that other countries are offloading their social issues and poverty onto us?

Ultimately, what reasons are there for being happy to see Roma in the UK? Taking up unskilled jobs? We've massive problems with that already. Adding to our culture? They're incredibly insular and by nature not willing to integrate, they/we'll always be outsiders.

People were horrified at the levels of Polish that arrived very quickly into the UK and Polish were hard workers who generally behave impeccably. The prospect of similar number of Roma arriving is a perfectly valid fear for people.

The same here. Ukip and Bnp have much in common. Just because one is against gays totally, the other ""likes"" gays but won't allow them to marry is still basically the same thing. If you aren't against gays you will allow them to be exactly same citizens than all the other people, no buts whatsoever. Bnp doesn't like any immigration, Ukip wants ""controlled"" immigration but at the same time Ukip ignores study which has proved that EU immigrants contribute to UK economy.

So what, if someone is here less than 7 years then what? Manifest doesn't say so as it would be too extreme to win any party seats.

A 3 man backline would mean we would need to play wingers who are willing and able to track back and defend at times.

We were shysters, loan sharks, we ate babies and were conspiring to take over the world.


When that is the mindset that you face from an overwhelming proportion of the society you live in, there isn’t much and an incentive to “integrate”. Why should you try to fit in to a society that hated you from birth? Why would you feel bad taking from people that do nothing but rag on your way of life? Why would you try to get a decent job, when you are discriminated against by almost everyone?


If any of you watched that “MY big fat gypsy wedding” nonsense, you’ll recall that almost every single groom had his identity hidden. The reason was always the same, if it got out that they were gypsies, then any hope of employment was taken away.


I’m not defending criminality. As and when it happens, action needs to be taken. I am only asking that everyone who instinctively hates the Roma and Gypsy populations ask, if you were in their situation, what would you do?

One time I came to work and one of them had shit on my tractor on the bonnet and stuck a little handwritten 'for sale' sign on it.

They had just thrown the dirty ones up in the tree and it was like a nappy tree with them all growing on it. Over the course of the next few months they slowly fell or were blown down and I had to pick every single one up. It's the shit they leave behind which probably outweighs the trouble they cause whilst there.

Ultimately, it does all come down to integration. Like many ethnic minorities, especially in densely populated urban areas, there can be a great deal of conflict.

The argument shouldn't be ""Gypsies cause crime"" because they have a different lifestyle, different beliefs. The argument should be ""Gypsies cause crime"" because our society doesn't seem to be well balanced to allow for integration of people with radically different viewpoints or beliefs.

How do we solve that problem though? No idea. But just saying ""Gypsies shouldn't be allowed to set up camps"" doesn't solve anything. It's going to happen. It's going to keep happening, and clamping down on them is only going to erode our own society's civil liberties slightly in the process.

In such a case, people wouldn't notice and certainly wouldn't tell their local newspaper about it. Why would the Guardian or any other newspaper print a story headlined, ""Travellers arrive and leave without anyone noticing!"".

I hear plenty of stories about terrible neighbours and terrible room mates. Does that mean a majority of neighbours and room mates are terrible? No. The reality is that the majority of neighbours and room mates are simply unremarkable and without incident so no one tells stories and no one reports it.

We also know that a story would have to be fantastically good for someone to remember it and retell it and for a newspaper to report it. Just like customer reviews: Most people with a neutral or positive experience will not bother to fill in a feedback form. Only people with a negative experience will take the effort to complain. Someone would have to do something really extraordinarily good for a customer to actually make the effort to communicate this to the management.

So with the case of travellers, only remarkable cases and stories will be told and reported on, and of the ""good"" stories, they would have to be absolutely outstanding to make the cut.

Therefore, from the anecdotal stories we hear, we can only logically conclude that there are probably more ""bad"" interactions with travellers than there are ""remarkably fantastic"" interactions.

OK - I have no idea about economics and how it works but as there are many more ""poor"" than ""rich"", would it not be better for the poor to have a little more money to put into the economy?  By the nature of being poor you have to spend just about everything you have where as being rich you have enough to save some.  ie if there are 5 people receiving £20k a year they are going to spend more than one person who earns £100k and saves £15k.  If £100k is spent by 5 people it means that more income tax is brought into government pot and there is a revenue turn round and VAT through shops ect which in turn adds to the wealth of the middle bracket, promotes job creation and all that kind of stuff, no? 

As far as I can see, what's happening is the bottom half have much less to spend so don't contribute as much and top bracket is getting richer off the lower brackets in a greater ratio than before, saving more money and then moving to Antigua as soon as they can and running their businesses at a loss from a European tax haven.  Obviously as the government receives less tax, its got less to spend on things like Trident and rail schemes and sod all to spend on the poor and sick.

The school i went to had dorms of 10-15, some were smaller. They all lead onto a large corridor/room with some sofas, this was the common room for that house. Other houses were set up differently. some dorms had there own bathrooms, usually given to the prefects, years were separated into each dorm. The prefects and the older boys in your house acted like older brothers. 


7-7:30 - crawl out of bed on your own prompting, shower if you can get them, flannel if not, brush your teeth, satisfy the call of nature and such like. make your way to the canteen if you are feeling keen and your house comes first that week. and its not too cold (No heating in the canteen)


7:30 - Bell - Breakfast in the canteen, queue up in houses and put through any time between 7:30 - 8:30 if you pop out early can go pick up letters from pigeon holes and i had a friend who went to see matron about medicine he had to take, and get asthma canisters for his inhaler i went with him, not sure why. 


8:45  - Bell - Day kids turn up tutorial starts if you didn't walk there before mad dash across the quad. Announcements read out and tutor reads a list of people he wants to talk to. Everyone else can go.


9-10:30 two lessons 45 minutes each mixed according to timetable 


10:30-10:45 break time play a school game that involved a squash ball or tennis ball and a particular part of the wall. I was an umpire because i was trusted with the rules probably one of my greatest achievements.


10:45 - 1 Three lessons 45 minutes each timetable dependent. Also the time when games was timetabled three times a week. Games would be either Rugby, Cricket or hockey depending on season. 


1 - 1:45 lunchtime much more hectic then breakfast cause all the day kids are there. still go in by house or year the protocal switched a few times while i was there. 


1:45 - 3:15 Two lessons 45 minutes, again mixed according to timetable. Day kids parents turn up and pick them up. 


3:15 - 5 Free time, people didn't change out of uniform i can't remember if that was a rule or not but no body did. We played british bulldog mostly in the summer if nothing was going on and some of the day kids hung around because there parents couldn't pick them up until later. Also some music lesson (personal) took place now and choir practice. Sometimes extra team practice of sports would take place. 


5-6 Prep time where you would sit with a teacher or prefect and do homework or project work. 


6-8 Free time however it was structured an prefects and house masters would organise activities, sometimes just watching a movie. Some people went to there rooms and read or went on there computers and get into bed. Couldn't leave the school but the older years were allowed to go to the local village which was a 20 minute walk away. 


8: suggested (you had too) that you would be in your dorm or house, people chatted and watched tv. this was also when we would teach the first years how to speak the school language that i can't remember now sadly. We had a toaster and a kettle so we would have tea and toast a lot. 


9:30 lights out everyone in bed with the lights turned off. some people got phones or laptops out but if matron or the house master caught you, you would have it confiscated and, depending on the house master, might get detention. 

Repeat. 


I loved it and am still friends with a lot of people from the school. The school holds a special place in my heart. 

By writing this i have realise how dependant on word i have become.


EDIT : Also saturday school which was chapel for mass, and then 2 lessons.

true,DubaiCM,null,null,"&gt;  If I'm buying art from an artist, then I'd quite like it to have been produced by him, or at least the original.

It is like if you go to a restaurant. The head chef won't be cooking every single item, but it will be up to his standards and he will approve each dish; he won't let it be served otherwise. 

Hirst's pieces don't require a unique skill to produce. Hirst can teach someone how to make them to the required standards, and then sign it to show it is approved. He is following in the tradition of many grand masters, from Michelangelo to Constable, who all used studios of apprentices to produce the bulk of the work and then apply the finishing touches themselves.

&gt;  I find it kind of dishonest for him to just slap his name on it and increase the price 10x simply because he approves of it.

He is open about how they are made, so I don't think he can be accused of being dishonest. The reason they fetch a high price (compared to one you knock up at home) is scarcity. Only a relatively small number are approved by him, and people are prepared to pay extra for that. Ultimately it is the market that dictates prices.

Really? There's plenty of upvoted, racist shit in world news, r/videos, r/news, sometimes r/WTF, advice animals  etc. which are all mainstream subs. Those subs also have shitty generalizations and negative anecdotes about black people and Muslims, but I'd agree that the anti-traveller sentiment is probably the largest. 

As someone else replying to you said, travellers living somewhere and then moving on without incident isn't a newsworthy story. There's camp near my house and there's never been any trouble, and while it is more of a permanent or at least long term settlement there, I've seen other anecdotes on here about positive experiences with travellers, they just often get drowned out by the negatives. 

There certainly are issues with some travellers, I'm not denying that at all, but they have and continue to face discrimination, especially in employment and with bullying in schools. There's a good guardian piece written by someone who grew up in a traveller camp, which I'll try and find.

Power corrupts. I even saw a study recently which found that even giving people a pay rise over others they work with made them think less of the people who didn't get it. Which goes a way to explain people's attitude to social welfare.

The Directors of companies, the Chief Executives of local councils, the top Private Secretaries all earn in excess of £100,000 a year easily. Yet MP's are far more highly scrutinised and often have harder jobs than these roles.

Really, it's the bizarre public obsession with keeping the MP's salaries as low as possible that caused the expenses scandal. They were topping up their, comparatively low salaries, with expenses. Granted, some of the claims were utter bullcrap, but I'd be much more in favour of increasing the salary ten fold and scrapping expenses altogether.

Another issue with low pay is that private companies offer a far more advantageous employment than being an MP does. You've got to be a special kind of person to accept a lower pay than you would in other sectors, and accept constant lambastation in the media for every single tiny thing you do. Conversely, the low pay might also mean that only those with funds behind them, the rich upper class, are attracted to this job. That isn't great for the health of the government when the majority of Members all come from the same background (obviously low pay isn't the sole cause of this problem but I don't think it helps).

true,Limes19,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"Firstly, I'm going to disregard the fact that that article is about US agencies rather than UK agencies. It's bad practice to assume that everything that is true of the NSA is true of GCHQ, and visa versa. But just for the sake of argument, let's assume that the NSA, the DEA, this ""SOD"" the article mentions, etc etc are all UK institutions, and that these alleged breaches of the US constitution are instead breaches of UK law.

&gt; what about institutional misconduct though?

Institutional misconduct is just that, misconduct. It should be treated as such. We didn't abolish the Police as an institution after Hillsborough. We didn't decide to make freely available to the public all planned military maneuvers after those ""friendly fire"" incidents. If there *have* been cases of misconduct (and I do mean ""*if*"") then of course they should be investigated, but that does *not* mean we need to stop the institutions themselves from operating.

&gt; this isnt a few rogue agents spying on exlovers, this is the institutions themselves teaming up to extend way beyond their brief, to deceive and undermine the idea of fair trials and justice (all the time knowing what they are doing is extremely dubious - thus they try to hide their trail).

There are some pretty clear legitimate reasons why you would want to hide where the information is coming from, and I disagree that those reasons include trying to ""deceive and undermine the idea of fair trials and justice"". The identities of witnesses are often kept secret during trials, and that doesn't threaten the validity of those at all. See, for example, the recent furore over the trial of ""Marine A"", including witnesses such as ""Marine B"" and ""Marine C"", and the question of whether their identities should be revealed. Or perhaps look to trials involving Police firearms officers.

It's important to hide secret capabilities that are effectively working because you don't want those capabilities to be undermined. During WW2 we didn't send unencrypted orders to units including phrases like ""...and we know this because we've broken the Enigma machine cipher"".

&gt; where does the trust go when things like that happen? without the whistleblowing, would we even know this was/is going on?

There is whistleblowing, and there is the leak of thousands upon thousands of sensitive documents. It is important to distinguish between the two.

Suppose, for example, you were working on implementing a new NHS computer system to share medical records around various hospitals and practices. You decide that professional misconduct is happening in the management of the project, and decide to speak out. It is one thing to say

&gt; Misconduct is happening, here are documents X and Y which prove this.

Or, another way of putting it is that it will become more expedient to pull out of these legally binding targets, and in the same time make significant savings on the energy bills.  

The 2008 Green Energy Act itself is set to potentially cost over £700bn in the next 40 years already (or £18bn year^-1 according to the government's own forecast).  So now we have analysts saying that that figure could rise to over £900bn by temporarily offsetting the costs in the short term or pushing off this particular reform to a later date.

Or we *could* start to look at tacking the problem in a different way; reduce bills *now* by ~10% by removing environmental taxes, subsidies, carbon swaps and the like, and have nearly a trillion pounds in the economy elsewhere over 40 years:

true,guernican,null,null,"This is a very, very complicated question. 

The crucial issue here is one of earning potential. If you think of what a political career offers you, it's primarily access. If you're assigned to a government department, at the very least you're gaining an intimate understanding of something that private enterprise is very, very interested in. 

This is not to say that every MP walks straight out of politics and into a corporate board seat, although it's depressingly common. But there seems, to my mind, to be something intriniscally wrong with taking a mandate given you by an electorate and translating that, eventually, into great wealth. Which is not to say that people don't need to make a living. But the implication is clear (and born out monthly, lest we forget, with incidences of serving politicians being caught offering access and influence for money). They're using specialist knowledge to play the system. 

/u/NervousEnergy says that politicians don't earn enough - or, rather, have a lower salary than their business counterparts. I disagree: executive pay is set by what the shareholders will bear. In this case, I believe the public have the right to say that MPs should not have an exponentially higher wage than the mean or median income. After all, they're here to represent our interests. Is that possible, if they're so divorced from the norm? Further to that point, many - the majority, in fact - also supplement their salary with consultancy work, usually disclosed (although, again as we know, sometimes not). 

Many MPs do work extremely hard. And many have extremely poor voting records in Commons, or rarely hold constituent surgeries. Like any job, you havepeople who are committed and diligent, and people who are less so. 

Finally, to /u/NervousEnergy's point about public education and the wealthy upper class, I would urge you to examine the current state of the Conservative Party. Well over half the current serving Conservative MPs went to public school: the msot recent figure I can find (2011) states 56%. The national average is less than 10%. In May 2010, 23 of the 29 serving cabinet ministers had a personal wealth of over a million pounds.

true,Limes19,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; i see what you are saying - and tbh, you are perfectly describing the difference between the Manning and Snowden cases. Manning basicly dumped data on the web, snowden on the other hand gave his cache of documents to a group of people experienced in editting such material so that it wouldnt end up precisely like you say. yet you seem to be equating the two approaches.

The effect is the same. How do the newspapers know what will or will not damage national security? Do you think newspapers have the capability to protect data in the same way GCHQ can? Snowden's leaks have been widely condemned as incredibly damaging by those in the intelligence services who, unlike the Guardian or similar, are in a position to know what they are talking about.

&gt; also, brushing the issue of institutional misconduct away like its nothing is unbelievable. the whole point is that if you dont do anything about it, the behavior becomes institutionalized and it becomes much more traumatic to do something about it. also, how are we to detect such misconduct without some kind of disclosure?

I never said nothing should be done about it. But compromising the ability of the agency to function because some agent listened in to his ex-girlfriend's conversation is ridiculous.

&gt; re the SOD - they hide the impetus for the investigation because it would result in a mistrial if they didnt. the american justice system relies on warrants and probable cause. i use this happening in the USA as a clear example of these powers corrupting - and quite seriously.

The Reuters report that your article was sourced from implies this is a practice that goes back way before these surveillance systems were in place. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,"" one official said. ""It's decades old, a bedrock concept.""

The advancement of religion is a charitable purpose. The Charity Commission rejected the Scientologists application for charitable status on the basis that Scientology is not a religion, because the law defines a religion as having a belief in some kind of deity or supreme power, and involves worship. The public benefit requirement wasn't fulfilled because you can only receive the 'spiritual benefit' from Scientology because you have to pay thousands of pounds to join. So while this ruling may have an effect on whether Scientology is now accepted in general law as being a religion (although I don't know the details of this) they will still have trouble proving that they provide a public benefit. And in terms of abuse, any benefit provided by a religion has to be balanced against any harm they do, this is the basis on which a few 'cult' type organisations have been knocked back.

When the doctor and Amy run out of the house, running away from prisoner Zero, the doctor stumbles upon the dog house that the TARDIS had crashed on and he realizes he was gone longer that just a few months because the dog house was already built and had to have been standing there for many years.

So this is the conversation as far back as I can remember it;

Doctor: This has to have been here for at least 12 years and you said 6? months

Amy: And you said 5 minutes.


This implies that Amy did not see the doctor after the doctor had originally told her that he will be back after 5 minutes. 




In the God Complex, when Amy entered the room where the worst fears are supposed to be revealed, there was a little girl with her suitcase waiting for the doctor, which also shows that the doctor did not return after he had originally told her he will be back after 5 minutes.

Anyway, I don't know how I feel about stuff like this. It's nice on paper but it rarely works out that way in practice.

Also, if God forbid we lost all these scary December fixtures, as the title says, we'd have lost 6 matches by the halfway mark. That'd effectively be curtains for our plans unless we won the remaining games of the season. In the past 7 or 8 years, the most number of losses to get 4th spot was 10 by Spurs about 3 years ago...the fewest number of losses to get 4th was 4, by us in 2008.

Obviously, mathematically, 6 losses wouldn't take us out of the running as we'd still have another half a season to go, but dropping 3 points to each of 3 teams who we could realistically challenge with for their spot, it'd be a massive blow.

Many university lectures are already virtually gender segregated, with almost no females in some subjects and almost no males in others.

Can a woman chose to be an electrician, plumber, IT consultant, or a man choose to be a nurse or childcare worker ? Or, will they be forced into another career *because of their sex*.

And the punishment for not believing in Christianity is hell which is being tortured forever.

How can you make blanket statements like Scientology assault their members but then get upset when someone does the exact same to other religions.

Most Scientology don't assault their members just like most Muslims don't kill people who leave the religion.

And the fact that you are justifying the catholic church being one of the richest organizations in the world while billions are starving is fucking pathetic.

* Yes!

* I would recommend living in a flat. Mostly first years and international students live on campus, but it is really easy to make friends in the flats. Living off campus will probably be pricier, and it might be tricky to find a place that will rent to you for only a few months

* Getting to London is pretty easy. Falmer station is on campus, which goes to Brighton station, and Brighton station has a line that will take you straight to London Victoria. The trip takes about an hour. If you have a 16-25 railcard (which you should get if you plan on traveling within the UK a lot) the ticket costs about 16 pounds for a day travelcard (round trip with unlimited tube travel in London)

* I had my smartphone, but also bought a cheap brick phone from O2 and paid for a basic service. Carried both of them around with me. Seemed to work out alright (although I had to learn how to text in T9 again... haha)

* English food isn't the best in the world, but there are some great spots in Brighton! Craving a Grubb's burger right now...

* I traveled to a bunch of places in the UK and Europe... It is pretty easy to get around, you can get to Gatwick airport from Brighton station.

If you have any more questions shoot me a PM... happy to help!",0,1386779992,null,0,false,0,cdz7ncw,t3_1oi3di,t1_cdz7ncw,t1_cdyujxv,null,1428270058,1,false,universityofsussex,t5_2stcb,1

Similar to the Arsenal game this all comes down to our midfield. 

Also don't forget Enrique's still out meaning we have an inexperienced player in our back 4 too. That and Skagger have leaked a few careless goals too of late.

Sure, there are stupid comments on Reddit - on pretty much EVERY subject. 

Take the following:

&gt;Obviously made-up; no evidence for extraordinary claims; keeps people intellectually and financially in thrall.
&gt;What else could it be but a religion?

Yes, it's rather broad and lacks finesses, but it points out some genuine problems with religion:

-'Obviously' made up. This is of course directed first and foremost at Scientology - which most people outside the religion can see is obviously fabricated by L. Ron Hubbard. For other religions? I would not go so far as to say they are 'made up' (which suggests a planned fraud, rather than a developing cultural shift)- but they can't ALL be true. All those which are not 'true' are therefore based on a 'fiction' of sorts.

-Lack of evidence for beliefs. This is fine of course - people are free to believe whatever they want, but you should not be offended that people point out there is no actual evidence that supports a Deity actually existing.

-Keeps people in 'intellectual and financial thrall' - Religion has time and again attempted to suppress scientific enquiry as well as promote false ideas such as creationism. Meanwhile many religions exact a compulsory 'tithe' on people and while this is typically 10% or so for many, Scientology has been known to suck up a person's entire life.

Now, again, the points were put without much thought or effort, yet they contain genuine points of debate and areas worthy of investigation. 

Dismissing these points as 'bashing', while easy and in a sense understandable, says more about your own insecurities than it does the validity of the criticism. ",0,1386781107,null,0,false,0,cdz85l1,t3_1smmge,t1_cdz85l1,t1_cdz75uc,null,1428269821,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

They fought against and recognized Hurt as the Doctor.  The New Paradigm has access and are the heirs to a group of the Davros Daleks who were there when Ten was shot and explained he self-regenerated. 

Now, the Daleks might not have known about Nine.  Rose wiped out all the Daleks who met him.  The Cult of Skarro was ignorant of that event.  So there is a potential miscount.  It also depends if the Daleks who escaped Donna's wrath were made aware that one of them had shot the Doctor and his explanation on how he lived.  Not to mention the whole wiping their memory thing.

Then again, depending on when these Cybermen come from they may know of Nine and shared the info with the Daleks.  The Cybus cybermen in the Christmas Cyberking episode had records of Nine and the stranded Cybus and Mondos will have had merged together by the Nightmare in Silver episode.

Also, the New Paradigm seems to have decided after many failed Dalek Emperors and several failed Davros dictatorships that a parlament of many Daleks is better than a single pure group that is easy to wipe out.  I.e. a somewhat impure Dalek empire that can't be destroyed by a single dues ex machina is better than a pure Dalek Empire that can be made to explode with an epic speech.

Right now we are operating under the rules established in [The Deadly Assassin](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Deadly_Assassin_%28TV_story%29), (which set the 12 regen limit AND also stated the regeneration count could be reset), according to Moffet in multiple interviews, including this one. So Matt Smith's Doctor is supposed to be the 13th form (after 12 regenerations) within the Whoniverse.

Once they introduce Capaldi's Doctor then it will be part of a new batch of regenerations. Which is not supposed to happen based on the idea that the Doctor probably won't try to use the Eye of Harmony to get additional regenerations. Nor are there Time Lords around to give him more. He was given 12 and should expect 12 regenerations (and 13 lives as the Doctor). 

So technically Matt Smith's Doctor IS the final Doctor, from the characters perspective. (Because the meta-crisis for the 10th Doctor did use up 1 regeneration and there was another just revealed one in the form of the War Doctor)

While we're in a position to possibly alter climate change, that should be the first route. After that, certainly let's adapt, but to do so while there's a possibility of avoiding such an extreme situation seems nonsensical to me.

In the end I suspect it will come down to a combination of both tactics but not trying to temper climate change will only make adapting to it even harder and less easy to accomplish.

The funny thing is that the town I live in has a huge settled Roma traveller community, I'd guess about 10-15% of the population. Most live in houses with caravans in the gardens or on council designated sites (there's 2 across the borough) and do things like run well known local businesses etc. They are actually pretty decent/just get on with their lives/no worse than any other family.

The problem IMO is ALWAYS with the traditional travelling gypsies, that move from illegal site to illegal site- that's when your house will get broken into, your kid comes home with a black eye or whatever. 

One of my scariest childhood memories is going downstairs in the middle of the night for a wee and seeing a small (child's?) arm come through the door reaching for the latch. I yelled for my dad, and my dog started barking so they fucked off. Talking to the neighbours, it turns out they had tried every door in our block.

To put it into context with your minority stuff that you were talking about in another comment, I think it's possible to explain it along the lines of the travelling gypsy community are to settled gypsies as radical Islamists are to the general Muslim population- they are the fringe that refuse to become stakeholders in their adopted locality and thus cause problems for the overarching racial classification that they fall under.

true,TheFergPunk,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I should point out considering you're last sentance that I have downvoted you.

But it's not for dogmatic reasons; it's because you're trying to use that very flawed Regnerus case as an argument agains't gay adoption.  Not to mention that instead of dealing with the criticism aimed at this study you simply try to brush it off; which is ironic considering you're going into the defensive claiming people will do the same about what the case says.

Now I'm familiar with the Mark Regnerus study; in fact I recall one person calling it the most credible study on the issue.  Which if true would mean that every other study is written in crayons and drool because the Regnerus study is in no way shape or form credible.

Overlooking the peer reivews which have slated it (which you have overlooked as seen by the end of your opening paragraph) this study was funded by N.O.M; the National Organisation for Marriage.  Essentially a group very much against LGBT rights such as marriage or adoption.

Now I'll give you a small break here; after all a biased funder doesn't mean a biased study.  However then we actually look at what the study examined; then we start to see the flaws.

Regnerus looked at a large random sample of adults who had been raised in different situations.

If they were raised by the married biological father and mother throughout their life he would put them in the intact biological family category.

So what about those who did not fit that criteria?

Well then Regnerus would ask them a set of further questions and put them in different categories based on their answers to those questions.

So one of those categories (the important one for this issue) was the category of lesbian mothers/gay fathers.

So how do you get into that category?

One way would be the format we'd be interested in which is they were raised by say two men or two women from birth to their adulthood.

Another way to get into that criertia is if one of the parents of the child had a same-sex relationship at any point of time during the childs upbringing.  That would also put you in the gay father/lesbian mother category.

So Regnerus is comparing intact heterosexual relationships against any relationship at all in which one of the members of said relationship engaged in a same-sex relationship during the childs upbringing.

That's not exactly a valid comparison now is it?  That's essentially trying to group of healthy heterosexual partnerships and then lump anything else as the alternative.

Only 23% of the lesbian mother respondants actually lived with their mother and her partner for at least 3 years.

Less than 2% of the gay father category lived with their father and his partner for at least 3 years.

In fact out of all the respondants to this study only 2 lived with a same-sex couple throughout their childhood.

2 is not a good enough number to start claiming gay adoption is bad.

The big problem here with this study is is tries to group heterosexual families that fell apart with homosexual families and label them all as ""the gays""

This study does not tell us a thing about planned smae-sex families.

Now to put the icing on the cake of this flawed study.  Mark Regnerus himself has admitted that his study wasn't about gay parenting.

true,egwo,null,null,"The Mark Regnerus study wasn't criticised because of the outcome, but because much of its methodology was kind of nonsensical, it was written in a very misleading way (the whole ""gay parents"" = ""parents of which at least one has had a same-sex relationship at some stage"" thing), and there were some pretty serious conflicts of interest.  Have you read the [American Sociological Association's criticism of it (pdf)](http://www.asanet.org/documents/ASA/pdfs/12-144_307_Amicus_%20%28C_%20Gottlieb%29_ASA_Same-Sex_Marriage.pdf), or the [independent audit commissioned by the journal the study was published in](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12001652)?  Some scientific studies are simply better than others, and some hypotheses are simply more correct than others.  It's not like politics, where we always have to treat ""both sides"" equally.

&gt; Essentially it appears that non-adopting same-sex parents give similar outcomes to single-parents, which is better than children's homes, but not as good as married biological parents.

If you pick the one dubious study that claims to show the outcome you prefer, instead of looking at reviews and reports gathering all the available research together.

&gt; This is intuitive, as if one parent leaves, the replacement parent, no matter which sex, cannot fully replace the one who left; that's just biology.

You are making a very broad and extraordinary claim (that being raised by a biological parent is always better than being raised by someone else) - you can't justify it with ""that's just biology"".  I mean, come on.

&gt; I don't understand why this is so controversial.

Because lots of people are arguing that same-sex couples should be prevented from raising children, and until recently, governments and courts generally agreed with them?

&gt; But at least when this post is finally buried I'll know that the pro-same-sex adoption side are every bit as dogmatic as the anti side.

Just think what you've just said.

You just said we don't know the extent of the problem or what it is going to be, so we're going spend everything trying to address it so that when we do know what the problem or challenges are, when they manifest, we'll have nothing left to deal with it but at least we'll be panicking appropriately!

It's akin to saying we don't know if we should panic so we should start panicking preemptively, and so reduce our ability to respond appropriately IF the threat manifests.

As it is we do have an idea of the worst case scenario, and the worst case scenario costs less to adapt to than what we're spending!

Some of these sectors are now under control and can be assumed to have rid themselves of their former criminal excesses, or are doing so...It is possible that THB is increasing in the illegal, non-regulated or noncontrolled sectors. If this were to be the case, it still cannot be assumed that the extent of THB is now at the same or even above the 'old' level it was at before the ban on brothels was lifted.

I didn't appreciate you had a high opinion of Carroll.

The favorable stats (games with Carroll vs games without him) are a bit deceptive. Carroll has come out of injury at a time Redknapp has experimented playing 2 up front, meaning QPR have been a lot more attacking. He also happened to miss the only 2 games we've lost all season, when we played against arguably the best team in the Championship (Burnley, managed by the ginger Mourinho) and had a shock away result against Doncaster, when QPR barely turned up.

Carroll seems to play in his own half or on the halfway line, adopting a link-up role. When going forward and under pressure his passing is, I'm afraid, not great.

He is physically slight so easily nudged off the ball. Otherwise he shows a good attitude and good work rate.

BAE is the real talent at QPR right now. It's worth the entrance fee just to see him play. Harry has given him 2 or 3 different roles: Defend, take the ball right up the wing, cross into the box to create goal-scoring opportunities. The guy is so skilled some opposition players lash out at him in frustration. He often takes on 3 opposition players with ease. We'd really love to sign BAE if we get the chance.",0,1386789324,null,0,false,0,cdzc1p9,t3_1smz2u,t1_cdzc1p9,t3_1smz2u,null,1428267933,13,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,13

If something is not in the cache it goes to imgur.com and pulls it from there. If imgur.com goes down, filmot.com should still return the hot images from cache for several hours (days?) but it will stop once the cache times out.

All I can say is that I am not modifying imgur content other than rewriting some links in the html passing through from imgur.com to filmot.org.

3. Having sex with my mums best friend. She's not even attractive. 

Is anyone spotting a theme here?

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt;  A quick search against their forum shows a lot of people asking about BBC access, particularly with Sky Go.

Not sure how this is a justification for Sky to pay the BBC. If anything it adds to my point about people expecting all of their content in one place. It doesn't mean that the BBC should be paying Sky. I suspect that if you searched for Setanta/ESPN/BT sport you'd see something similar - and these are channels that pay Sky for EPG positions, same as the BBC, and charge their viewers a separate fee, very similar to the BBC.

&gt; I don't know why the BBC don't go straight through SES S.A, the owners of the actual satellites then simply pay Sky the rate-limited fee to get on the EPG listings.

The BBC does use SES/Eutelsat for their day to day satellite needs. But there's clearly some reason why they did not or could not do so for the 48 channels (24 SD and HD) during the Olympics. Presumably Sky had the capacity to spare, the transmission facilities, and could get it running immediately. And they were willing to do it at no cost to the BBC - can't complain about that (you're the one complaining about EPG costs after all).

SES were in on it, as this press release from them seems to indicate: http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2012/11277870

&gt; Every single user already had analogue, they weren't faced with a digital switch over, this is an apples and oranges comparison. When the switchover happened Sky was in a unique position to offer absolutely everything in a single package, making it very attractive.

Switchover happened at least 11 years after Sky Digital launched, and about 8 years after Sky analogue was shut down. That's plenty of time to get the point across that Freeview/Freesat exists. I don't know anyone who subscribed to Sky because of digital switchover - most people I know really did just go and buy a Freeview box/TV. I don't know anyone with Freesat.

But it doesn't change the fact that people do not want a plethora of boxes and a load of different aerials/dishes to get the stuff they're forced to pay for.

&gt;  If people had to buy both a freeview box and a sky subscription then very clearly at least some of them would have only have opted for the first option alone. 

Not if they wanted the Sky channels. You seem to be suggesting that the only thing people watch is the BBC and that no one would use Sky if they didn't have the BBC on the guide. You're not the only one to suggest it, but it makes no sense nonetheless.

&gt;  If Sky stopped carrying terrestrial it would piss of their customers in quite a major way. Do you remember when Virgin lost Sky One and lots of people jumped ship to Sky? And that's for mediocre Sky One which at the time had little other than ST:TNG and Simpsons repeats and maybe LOST iirc.

""lots of people""? 

&gt; Yes and it's me that is ""insisting"". It's either that or pay someone to clamber on the roof of my flat's building to fit a new aerial which would involve contacting my arsehole factors to get roof access. I plan on selling up soon anyway.

But Virgin still insist on you subscribing to get the free channels. 

&gt; If they did not provide the BBC channels then I would not have the cable TV service, even though I typically only watch less than an hour of live tv per week anyway.

That's up to you, but it's wrong to suggest that everyone would do the same. The BBC's worth is often overstated.

&gt; Perhaps but I suspect you underestimate the draw of the main channels. Things like X-Factor are (sadly) huge phenomenons. Every one of the highest viewed shows is on terrestrial. Sure, that's largely down to having the most potential audience but that doesn't matter now, they exist and people want them.

Because, on the whole, they have the most income. The BBC receives (under threat of prosecution) entire pounds per month, per channel from each TV licence that they can spend. No wonder that their content is able to pull in more viewers. No other broadcaster can do this.

&gt; Sure, that's largely down to having the most potential audience but that doesn't matter now, they exist and people want them.

People do want them, sure. And they want it in one box, not a ""BBC receiver"" and an ""every other TV channel receiver"".

&gt; But what if the offered terms are unreasonable? If Mr M were to demand one hundred billion dollars from the BBC should they lose it's funding when they say no?

There has already been work between the BBC/public service channels/Sky and OFCOM to look at the fees. Clearly all parties will find something that they deem reasonable. To some people it appears that reasonable is ""£0"" or ""Sky should be paying"". I don't think that's reasonable (but I don't think some of the fees Sky can currently charge to commercial channels are, either).

Sky's market power has already attracted Ofcom's attention. I believe the rates are already controlled by Ofcom, as is ""open access"" where they can't deny any channel from appearing on Sky's EPG provided they pay the fees and comply with some basic regulations.",0,1386792644,null,0,false,0,cdzdos9,t3_1sgdbb,t1_cdzdos9,t1_cdyn4fw,null,1428267168,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

*  ""The Government is now taking legal advice amid fears that the judgment could open the way for organisations branded as “cults” to receive tax breaks. It is understood they are examining the possibility of a change to the law""

* ""ministers voiced alarm that it could open the way for the group to claim lucrative tax breaks worth hundreds of thousands of pounds a year and other legal privileges.""

* ""Tory ministers immediately rounded on Labour, branding the Equality Act – steered through Parliament by Harriet Harman when in power – as “flawed”, arguing the decision will leave “hard-pressed taxpayers” funding exemptions from local rates for scientologist churches. ""

* ""In a landmark judgment, five Supreme Court Justices redefined religion in law in order to enable the group to conduct weddings. ""

* Conservative politicians: ""But we now discover Scientology may be eligible for rate relief and that the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill, all thanks to Harriet Harman and Labour's flawed laws.” 

I know what I've just posted is word-heavy, but it shows the controversy that this action is making within government. The tories seem to be massively against this rebranding as an attempt to get at labour for the equalities act in 2010. Even Michael Gove called Scientology an ""evil cult"", which may show that the controversy here isn't just for economic reasons. Personally, I think that Dave and the tories will put up a big fight over this issue, using it both as a way to steer votes away from labour, and to maybe secure the anti-scientology vote. God, I love politics. 

I'm just going to clarify that this isn't a substitute to reading the actual article, it's really important that you get some informed information (not just for nitpicking and confirmation bias) before making claims of bribary or corruption from what i've seen in this thread.

Let's say for arguments sake that this is going to happen. What are we going to do at the striker position?

true,Stratocaster89,lfcflame,,"You've clearly had a bit of trouble reading whats written here, so ill break it down for you. 

&gt; We need a more dynamic, charging box to box midfielder in Gerrards/Barkelys mould. 

I didnt mention a time frame here, gerrard and barkley are dynamic, charging midfielders. I didnt say they had pace, you said that. 

When was the last time Joe Allen charged through the midfield, or into the box? or followed up a lose ball on the edge of the box and made something happen?  
Pretty much never. He's also not very fast at all, nor do you see him sprinting about the pitch, or throwing in last ditch clearances/tackles or blocks. You'd class someone as athletic if they where like this, Allen is not athletic when you compare him to players that clearly are. He is not dynamic when you compare him to players that clearly are. 

Henderson really isnt a box to box midfielder. You ask 100 football fans to describe him, very few would class him as a box to box midfielder. He's not really anything at the moment other than a utility player. He's not developed a clear role in any team hes played in. 

&gt; currently Gerrard isn't a box to box midfielder.

But Barkely is (and gerrard is most well know as), so i dont know why you've chose to ignore that part in your initial reply.

true,alk3v,lfc99,,"I think what needs to be said is that they're both different in playstyle. Also they're both different from Gerrard and Lucas too. Similar to QuantoQuandoQuatro was saying, Allen is your 'true CM'. 

Allen: Links defense to attack, covers ground and keeps moving. Pass and move. More technical and provides more creativity than Hendo does typically. I don't fully trust him with creative duties just yet though and without Gerrard I'm hoping he can step up to the plate. 

Hendo: The workhorse that closes down on the midfield to deny space and joins the attack. His defensive presence is a very fresh and mobile alternative to what Lucas provides.

Lucas: DMF giving license for others to go forward covering FBs and runs from midfield as necessary. Uses positioning and smart movement to end attacks. 

Gerrard: Playmaker and centerpiece for offense. Set pieces will suffer with him out.

I see the 4 each having their role and bringing something different to the game. I would like to see them being used to give the team more dimension against differing opposition. There are times where the lack of mobility in midfield with Gerrard-Lucas has hurt us. There's also times where Gerrard is needed to provide the play making and an Allen-Hendo midfield likely would fail to break down the opposition.

---

... I think we actually play better without Baines. I am not saying Baines isn't an amazing, and vital player- but without him we use Barkley down the middle more, and don't waste as much possession with Baines's crosses. 

It seems like the side have got into a rut with Baines, he was a true shining light for a long time and everything was built around him- but now we have a lot more about us, yet our play doesn't reflect the additional dynanism in the first 11 as much as it should. 

Him being out has forced the team to think outside the box with their distribution channels- and I feel we are better for it. If he can come back in the team, and we can keep these lessons in mind- we will be even better. 

---

I think the big issue is that we have Lukaku and not Fellaini as a target man for Baines's balls now, and they are a very different type of player. Pretty much everything Fellaini did well, Lukaku is poor at, and visa versa. 

Baines and Fella worked so well together, because Baines could whip in his killer balls from deep and Fella would get a chest on them and either sneak a shot or a pass... Lukaku cannot do this. He is a player who is stunning when looking at goal, but woeful with his back to it... Having Oviedo cutting into the box on the left instead of the ball thrown in by Baines has allowed us to exert more pressure high up the pitch, and really force teams into their shells. 

I just hope Bainesey can learn from the games he hasn't played in, and also hope that this doesn't give Bill an excuse to flog him to United. ",0,1386794722,null,0,false,0,cdzepsh,t3_1sn7md,t1_cdzepsh,t3_1sn7md,null,1428266688,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

2. Expense claims need to be authorised prior to claim being attempted. Say needing to take a taxi from their home in Clapham to Westminster when the bus/train/tube is perfectly available.

&gt; Unless there is some compelling contextual reason for holding otherwise, religion should not be confined to religions which recognise a supreme deity. First and foremost, to do so would be a form of religious discrimination unacceptable in today's society. It would exclude Buddhism, along with other faiths such as Jainism, Taoism, Theosophy and part of Hinduism. The evidence in the present case shows that, among others, Jains, Theosophists and Buddhists have registered places of worship in England. [...]

 &gt; For the purposes of charity law, section 3(2)(a) of the Charities Act 2011 now states that: ""'religion' includes – (i)	a religion which involves belief in more than one god, and (ii) a religion which does not involve belief in a god."" [...] It has no direct application to [this case], but it is a further indication that the understanding of religion in today's society is broad. [...]

&gt; For the purposes of PWRA, I would describe religion in summary as a spiritual or non-secular belief system, held by a group of adherents, which claims to explain mankind's place in the universe and relationship with the infinite, and to teach its adherents how they are to live their lives in conformity with the spiritual understanding associated with the belief system. By spiritual or non-secular I mean a belief system which goes beyond that which can be perceived by the senses or ascertained by the application of science. I prefer not to use the word ""supernatural"" to express this element, because it is a loaded word which can carry a variety of connotations. Such a belief system may or may not involve belief in a supreme being, but it does involve a belief that there is more to be understood about mankind's nature and relationship to the universe than can be gained from the senses or from science. I emphasise that this is intended to be a description and not a definitive formula.

Of course people have opinions, but sometimes they are wrong or misinformed. They base opinions on silly things. Example: The ONLY thing I ever heard about Diame was that he's Powerful. He's a big physical presence, and thats what made him a good DM. To me, this opinion is stereotypical and does not have any footballing value. Just because the guy is huge, you see tons of people here talking about his hard tackling. When watching him actually play, you'll notice that he's much more than that. Very good with the ball, intelligent, and versatile. A poor mans Yaya Toure. People base their opinions on silly things, most pundits do this all too often. So to me, if you are aligning with a pundit, I assume you aren't looking at the footballing aspect of the issue and to me it seems you are just going along with what you heard on MOTD. Another example: we need a hard tackler for a DM. I'd strongly argue that this opinion indicates a lack of football understanding. You have people complaining about Lucas getting yellows, and they are the same people calling for a ""Hard Tackler"" to come in. its stuff like this that makes me think some people don't know anythign about the game. I think there are certain football truths that aren't up to opinion. Like the truth that the most important aspect of a DM is their reading of the game. So most opinions I will listen to and constantly compare to my own (ex: henderson. This is why i made the hendo v west ham match comp), but some things, I just shake my head and give up (ex: allen is a bad player and should be sold).

Then you have to consider deposits/rent of a flat or a bedsit of some sort, which can bring the total well over £1000.

Therefore we won't know how to deal with that until it is upon us and assuming we will be able to manage that unknown situation would seem highly unwise to me.

So the current policy won't address that, but you seem to think it's going to be a *World After Tomorrow* affair.  It's not going to happen over night.

Arguing today how to manage an unknown scenario tomorrow, as you rightly describe it, seems doubly strange - especially when it means costing the economy of today year on year.

&gt;I never said we should spend everything on doing so, but ignoring the situation and waiting to deal with it is madness.

Yet nobody is actually saying that.  The problems we face today, like coastal defences could be addressed better today than planting windmills on a never-maybe-tomorrow basis.

&gt;Also, asserting that the cost of dealing with the situation is however many times cheaper is total conjecture as we can't accurately predict what is going to happen.

&gt;I watched the video.

Those two sentences suggest you didn't, or didn't take it in.  They actually argue how we do know what is going to happen to a certain degree, which is the point behind '50:1'.

If you make the supply of something illegal whilst barely punishing the clients what happens? Supply is heavily constrained whilst demand remains roughly the same, so the price goes through the roof &amp; it becomes a lucrative arena for criminals. 

If you want to curtail an activity you need to attack the demand side of the problem. If you want to prevent the criminality which goes along side black markets you should aim to undercut the criminals through subsidy. 

This is the solution to our problems in the sex trafficking &amp; illicit drug black markets. You make regulated supply incredibly cheap to anyone who wants it, but you treat and or punish anyone who causes social damage as a result.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"1. Those are the circumstances I was talking about. I have family in the North East. They pay for the internet access, and I chip in when I can.

2. My stuff is already in a cheap storage place. I can't afford the deposit on a new place or even the travel down. It would be less complicated if my girlfriend wasn't doing a masters degree at Teesside, which kind of restricts my movement options in the short term.

3. Well, I studied Mechanical Engineering. In terms of specialisation, I have experience in project management, manufacturing, quality control, design, logistics etc. so at the moment it's very much open field, I have no true specialisation and won't do until I have a couple more years of experience under my belt. I also have extensive experience in finance so i'm looking into that too, though I have no formal qualifications for that. I've been getting a lot of interviews but always seem to fall at the last hurdle (it's only a matter of time though really). 

Due to the afformentioned circumstances i'm looking in the north east short term, and countrywide from August 2014 (As my girlfriend will be in a position to move with me). I wouldn't for a second move for a minimum wage job though, i'm looking within commuting distance for those (So ~35 miles at most, depending on location relative to major towns with good transport links). Financially, it just wouldn't make sense. It's a pretty difficult situation, i'm just lucky I have emotional and financial support from family and friends to keep me going, which is another reason to stay where I am. It already cost me and my girlfriend a significant amount to move from our flat where we went to university, to where we are living now, which pretty much wiped out any savings I had.

4. From this country or not, they still need a) the finance to move here and b) the work ethic and the skills employers need. I know it's anecdotal, but there was a guy whom I worked with in Formula Student at university who had moved over from Bulgaria to study. The first year he was here he worked in a Kosher and Halal meat slaughterhouse as a cleaner, a job which relatively few Brits would take. Olongside that and his degree, he was a freelance photographer. I honestly haven't met anybody so humble and so hardworking in my entire life. Rather than trying to block their entry into the country, we need to give employers a reason to choose us over them.

Yes, but, at least as far as I know, when the law was penned, most, if not all, marriages were a religious ceremony.

3) There should be no second homes, instead a relatively well furnished apartment should be built in London and be made available for MPs that do not live within a certain distance of Parliament.


Also as to the comment where someone said the type of person they want to be an MP is one that takes a lower wage for a shit job, you're essentially saying you want to have idiots or power hungry individuals applying for the job.

I wouldn't mind being an MP and if I was in a position to get elected I'd probably go for it, and I'd want to do it to have the power to change things.

""(Pat Finucane's) family have campaigned for a full independent inquiry and believed they were set to achieve that when they went to Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister last October.

Instead, they were shocked to be told that a review, conducted by a senior lawyer, rather than an inquiry would take place.

In an affidavit filed as part of their legal challenge, Mrs Finucane claimed the family was treated ""cruelly"".

According to her, the only explanation for the apparent change of mind was the intervention of a person or persons unknown.

She alleged: ""This view was supported by a comment made by the Prime Minister during the meeting when he said 'It is true that the previous administration could not deliver a public inquiry and neither can we.

""There are people in buildings all around here who won't let it happen'.""

It was revealed on Tuesday, however, that a senior official has averred that Mr Cameron instructed him that he did not use the words alleged.

Barry Macdonald QC, for the Finucanes, told the court his clients have a record of the meeting but no minutes have been made available from the British Government.""

true,Nessunolosa,cnty-uk,"Previously USA in London ","Do you believe that those living under a central authority pumping out anti-Jew propaganda were truly aware of it? I doubt it. More than likely, they simply accepted prevailing cultural attitudes. 

Anti-Semitism was around for many hundreds of years before the Nazis. It's very easy now to say that this was wrong, given the cultural conditioning one experiences with regards to Jewish people, the attitudes that led to the Shoah, and how the international community has decided to deal with those past attitudes. 

I don't buy your example. If I said, ""Oh, but I know a black guy at work! He's very good at what he does,"" I would believe it a racist comment, albeit subtly so. I would be implying that there is a general way that all black men act, and this one friend of mine is but an outlier. I imply that **despite** his blackness, he is actually a person and works hard and does what I think humans generally should do. 

To me, the account above feels uncomfortable to even write. It is well established that talking about black people in such a way is unacceptable. Yet, you say it **is** acceptable for Roma. How exactly is this different? 

The answer is that it is not different. It is every bit as offensive to say, 'Oh, but I know a Gypsy at work and he's very good at what he does!' as it would be to say so about a black person, a woman, a Sikh, a Pakistani person, a blind person, or many other incarnations of ""Other.""

Real estate is a finite resource which is being competed for by an evergrowing number of people - there's only one way for it to go.

I work in investment property in Australia professionally and I'm an investor personally and while admittedly I'm not expert on the London property market, reading the reports seem to indicate these prices aren't going to revert.

Typically what you find is that in strong competitive markets such as London with massive undersupply is that there can be two outcomes:

1) Property developers and investors fund a huge surge of new housing to meet the demand. This can occassionally flood the market and cause prices to first stabilize and then deflate. Prices will continue dropping until developers and investors stop injecting new supply. Everything stabilises and we see a new 'bottom' which will last up till demand overtakes supply once more and the dance continues.

2) Prices continue to rise and sales volumes decrease by the lack of affordability. Affordability is a major element in property markets and the more expensive something is, the less people can afford it. This sounds obvious but for markets you typically will find prices grow and grow and grow and grow and eventually become so expensive there's simply no more buyers. However, there isn't as great a correction as my first scenario because there's still massive demand that isn't being met. You'll typically find there to be a small 'correction' phase where prices fluctuate at the top but don't really move too much and stay extremely high. Sales volume will pick up again when there's a new economic stimulus, such as lowering interest rates etc.",0,1386804253,null,0,false,0,cdzjc4w,t3_1sns96,t1_cdzjc4w,t1_cdzftfn,null,1428264512,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I did my research on it though, and apparently it is a common delicacy in Japan - and they don't suffer any higher rates of food poisoning.

Wakey not really having a team and then sheffield not being too far away, we do drag support from the outer areas but with the exception of a few liverpool/arsenal/scum fans 95% of the people I know who care for the beautiful game from Leeds are Leeds, young, old and everything in between.

The poor home support comments further down I can't really argue with but it's commendable the numbers we do get considering prices and form.

I can't speak for everyone, but no matter how much you love leeds it's been a hard couple of years for the club and supporters finance wise, a lot of people have to pick and choose what games they can attend.

This sometimes leaves the ground a little dead and it seems a little middle-aged/passionless but there are probably double the amount of supporters receiving texts, listening to radios or constantly checking the scores that are full of passion for Leeds and would sing their hearts out for ninety minutes given the funds.

It seems absurd for their letter to claim the following:

&gt; We have tried to contact you on numerous occasions to give you the opportunity to return this item to us (at our cost and no inconvenience to yourself), but to date you have refused to do so.

Firstly, it is impossible for it to be returned at no inconvenience to the customer. Even if they sent a courier to wait outside your house until you were in, you'd still have to stop what you were doing, open the door, fetch the PS Vita and hand it to them. Obviously they aren't going to do this though. They'll ask you to specify a day and make you wait in which is clearly seriously inconvenient.

Secondly, have they actually got a response from people they are sending these letters to saying they refuse to give it back? They can't take no response as a refusal. Perhaps you just haven't read the letters, perhaps you have moved since the PS Vita arrived.

If I had received one of these by accident, I would agree to return it only if it did not require me to commit to be in to give it to a courier or take any other action or, if they offered me something to compensate me for the inconvenience of having to stay in at some specified time (with the value of the required compensation depending on how longer period I would have to wait in for the courier and how far in the future I needed to specify the time).

If you sent them a package with something in and then wrote to them asking for it back, you can bet that they would say that unfortunately they had destroyed it, lost it or something similar. I don't see how they can send something to someone who didn't order it and expect them to look after it for them for free and without being asked (initially) to.

Developers aren't interested in playing the speculative market game unless they're self funded which is about 1% of developers.

Developers are always at risk and minimising risk is a key part of their continued operation. To this end they target under supplied markets because it's easy to sell their properties. They build in their profits into the build and building when prices are rising can be quite dangerous because they might be at the peak of the market. Most developers build at the bottom of the market or at the start of a new growth cycle.

L. Ron Hubbard and starting a religion for money[edit]
Further information: Scientology as a business
While the oft-cited rumor that Hubbard made a bar bet with Robert A. Heinlein that he could start a cult is unproven, many witnesses have reported Hubbard making statements in their presence that starting a religion would be a good way to make money. These statements have led many to believe that Hubbard hid his true intentions and was motivated solely by potential financial rewards.
Editor Sam Merwin, for example, recalled a meeting: ""I always knew he was exceedingly anxious to hit big money—he used to say he thought the best way to do it would be to start a cult."" (December 1946)[74] Writer and publisher Lloyd Arthur Eshbach reported Hubbard saying ""I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money is."" Writer Theodore Sturgeon reported that Hubbard made a similar statement at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. Likewise, writer Sam Moskowitz reported in an affidavit that during an Eastern Science Fiction Association meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said ""You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion.""[75] Milton A. Rothman also reported to his son Tony Rothman that he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention. In 1998, an A&amp;E documentary titled ""Inside Scientology"" shows Lyle Stuart reporting that Hubbard stated repeatedly that to make money, ""you start a religion.""[76]",0,1386809628,null,0,false,0,cdzlp11,t3_1smmge,t1_cdzlp11,t1_cdz33yq,null,1428263412,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

i am not talking about espionage/counter espionage - im talking about surveillance.

spying on citizens is indeed legal - as long as the relevant provisions are met. part of the furore over this issue in the states is that these requirements weren't always met, and indeed the officials deliberately tried to avoid them and then mislead the oversight committees about this fact. there are some pretty serious reports that there was widespread institutional misconduct, despite this former officials assertions that there weren't.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Isn't this argument ultimately flawed because it seems to put a monetary value on the earth?

No.   

It puts a monetary value on the only thing a monetary value can be put on, by definition, the economy or the value bestowed on it.  That's what a market is.

&gt; Isn't the problem that the Earth potentially becomes uninhabitable for humans or at least a large part of it for a large number?

Again, no, but this comes to the crux of it.

What alarmism have you been told, and by whom, that makes you think that?    That isn't remotely the problem that faces us.  

Are there places of population explosions, globally, that are unsustainable?  Yes, but that hasn't been any different during the existence of man.  

Should we work to prevent to such implosions of unsustainability around population centres in the modern age?  Of course, yes.   

Does this mean that if the Western world effectively dumps its economy to make a meager environmental change, in something that might happen anyway with a Solar hotspot in 50 years time, will it make anything better?  No. As it is with mankind CO2 emissions what we're doing is like scratching a spot on Goliath's bum cheek.  The UK closes down several coal plants over a decade and the emerging economies open more by the week. You could literally solve world famine, malaria and polio for a fraction of the cost - dustbowl or not.

If it means that we invest now into R&amp;D for the future, and not implement current technology which might make us sleep better but not actually achieve anything, however much we put into it, then do that.

Globally we can invest trillions into something we know won't work because of something that may happen, or we can invest in something that means that if the worse does happen then humanity can do what it does best, what it's evolved to do, and adapt and make things work so the worst doesn't actually effect us.

We've invested billions into windfarms which we now know won't be the end solution but enviro taxes are raising our bills and lowering standards of living.  If we'd invested a fraction into coastal defences instead we'd have saved lives, lowered bills, and be closer to a long term energy solution...and have something to export.",0,1386810493,null,0,1386812454,0,cdzm259,t3_1smnsd,t1_cdzm259,t1_cdzkpon,null,1428263192,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Culturally we're not much different. You'll find this especially so in big cities like London, but we're heavily Americanised over here (although we wouldn't dare admit it!) and I'd say in terms of getting by you'll have no problem since everything will more-or-less be familiar.

However, here's some things that spring to mind that could be useful for the Yank in England who misses home:

- Food that may be hard to come by (you can probably pick up a lot of American snacks in the London area): girl scout cookies, canned pumpkin, good Mexican ingredients (rice/beans/salsa/tortillas in particular), saltines, Grape Nuts (although some supermarkets will stock this cereal, strangely), Sun Chips, etc.

- On the topic of food, London hosts 2 Chipotles and a Five Guys'. It might be worth letting her know this when she is most missing home, as a small taste of your famous fastfood can be comforting from time to time.

- If she intends to drive, it might be worth looking into a book that would help adjust from one side of the road to the other. You can use your US driving license for 1 year in the UK before having to sit a UK Driving Test, so while legal, it can still be daunting driving for the first time in the UK.

- Our regional DVD lock prevents watching US DVDs over here. If she has a favourite film/TV boxset, maybe buy here a Region 2 (UK) version of this to bring with her.

- Failing that, a Netflix gift card (ideally with VPN access to the USA) would be a good alternative. Our version of Netflix has a lot of American shows and movies.

- In terms of general usage, a mobile phone that works over here (or even a pre-paid SIM card for 1 month) would be useful. We use a different band to USA phones so it might be difficult and/or expensive to bring a US mobile phone and roam.

That's all that comes to mind right now. I'll try and come back with more stuff tomorrow when I can grill the wife a bit more (she's sleeping right now.)

If we can finish the year ahead of those teams i'm confident we can get fourth seeing as the three hardest fixtures in my opinion are out of the way (Ars, Che, Manc - Away). 

So lets break it down, if we can get 3 points of Spurs this weekend it would be ideal, we would be 6 points ahead of them and with them having to go to Southampton away before new years i'm fairly confident even if we draw to spurs and only pick up a point from each of our next four games we will be ahead of them.

Moving onto Everton we are two points ahead of them, with them having a trip to Swansea and a visit from Southampton. Personally I can't see them getting more than 6 points from these fixtures seeing their thinnish squad. If that is the case and we get our desired 6 points from the next 4 games we will also be ahead of them.

So intention does matter in this case.  If you're actively trolling for customers by sending them stuff, that's an unsolicited gift.  If you do it by accident, this law doesn't have much to say about it.  However its wikipedia entry says:

From 2000-2010 you saw some pretty amazing growth in the Australian property market and interest rates were substantially higher than they are today. The drivers for growth are there and it's not cheap money it's the need for housing driven by population growth. Cheap or cheaper money is simply making that growth easier to facilitate. Naturally rates will rise and this will affect the markets but people anticipate a crash when really you see minor corrections. The reality is is that property owners will sooner tighten their belts in the bad times than sell up.

People always drastically overestimate the speculative nature of property and the purported 'bubbles'. It's easy to point to a bubble to explain a normal growth pattern. 

The speculative nature of property would account for less than 20% of the total value of property and that would be concentrated almost entirely in hot markets.

What does the first paragraph mean? 

Obviously we couldn't take in everyone, which is why there was a convention between several countries in 1938 to discuss taking in refugees. However we could have taken in a lot more, as could other countries. 

Why seeking asylum in brackets? We were directly discussing the genocide of the Jews, which was an absolutely justifiable reason to seek asylum. In terms of modern day asylum seekers, we should definitely accept them. Again there is obviously a limit on how many can be taken, which is why more than one country will take asylum seekers. 

You can't know what would happen if the tables were turned unless that actually happens. What might happen in that situation is not how we should judge whether we accept asylum seekers.

true,commenterjoe,null,null,"Having actually looked at the cannabis cafes in holland and their legality is interesting, the shops are tolerated but not fully legal as people mistakingly believe and there is a legal limit of 5 grams that people can have on them at one time (source:www.amsterdam.info/coffeeshops/‎). It is a pretty grey area legally infact there is a coffee shop called Grey Area!
(www.greyarea.nl)

One of the interesting things is that not just cannabis that is produced in Holland is available in coffeeshops,but also herbal and resin cannabis that is imported from abroad illegally by criminal gangs.

When Spain decriminalized cannabis it had a good law for this if you grew herbal cannabis for your own use that was fine, but if you were found with moroccan hashish which floods the country and brings crime with it you were arrested. That Spain doesn't prosecute people who want to use it for themselves but shields its people from the worst of the Criminal Aspect of the Cannabis Trade.

Anyway my point:
Cannabis Cafes would need to ensure
*All products are produced within the United Kingdom by Licensed Growers.
*Bouncers/Security for the shop, not being disrespectful to cannabis users this is standard in Dutch Coffeeshops. Also checks for anti social behavior those with a serious problem will be shutdown.
*Maximum Amount of Cannabis that can be bought/delivered from Cannabis Cafe/Dispensary.
*Cannabis Must be Inspected for quality frequently, shops that sell contaminated cannabis,Herbal or Resin will face disciplinary action. 
*Weights and Scales to be checked by authorities, no underselling of cannabis.
*Shops will be advised (not mandatory although) to stock medically significant cannabis products, for example herbal cannabis high in CBD.
* Home users allowed to grow cannabis for own use only with permits following the example of canada and the usa, those that wish for others need a care giver or commercial farmer license.
*British Farmers are allowed to grow under license from the Government, cannabis outdoors commercially (for example a field of Hollands Hope) (http://en.seedfinder.eu/strain-info/Hollands_Hope/Dutch_Passion/).

On the other hand, restoring Gallifrey would make an excellent show finale; I can make an argument that the Doctor is just about out of regenerations; he's supposed to permanently die at Trenzalore and the Christmas special is going to take place there; and much of the show after the Pandorica has been leading up to the downfall of the Silence on Trenzalore (so, it seems like a whole lot of stuff is going to be wrapped up in the upcoming special).

that thinking you can take in refugees and that genocide will be avoided may as well be like thinking you can plug up a black hole. You'll destroy your country and other the world will still be a shithole regardless.

&gt;Obviously we couldn't take in everyone, which is why there was a convention between several countries in 1938 to discuss taking in refugees. 

Which was exactly my point, thanks for agreeing.

&gt;Why seeking asylum in brackets? 

see the word ""today"" right after. The Jews in Germany were certainly seeking asylum, saying other countries are obligated to get involved no matter what the costs is something else.

&gt;In terms of modern day asylum seekers, we should definitely accept them.

No country has any obligation to accept them, and you shouldn't either for the most part. Thinking your country has any duty to take care of the rest of the world is only going to give countries that don't the opportunity to become more successful while yours is dragged down.
 
You'd think you'd people would get it consider Enoch Powell already said the same sort of thing 40 years ago. But I guess anything he said can't be true because people can call him racist or mention that he worked for Thatcher.

&gt;You can't know what would happen if the tables were turned unless that actually happens. 

see refugees in China and South Africa, the Palestinians that are rejected or mostly live in shitty camps with no rights, or simply the fact that all of the people just happen to be flocking to places in Europe and the west, and never end up in South Korea for some reason.

You should be well enough aware from your ""lovely hard working immigrants"" that they don't all care for the same rights you value.

They brew their own beer on site (the mango beer is a must-try) as well as doing amazing food. It's just across the road from the Millennium Stadium too which is worth seeing, it's one of the largest rugby stadiums in the world. If you happen to be in town on a rugby day, I would urge you to go and watch a game here. Rugby is a huge part of Welsh culture, and the Welsh are very proud of their team. It'd be expensive but well worth the money.

Just down the road from Zerodegrees is another great pub, Urban Tap House. They have a huge collection of beers and a great atmosphere.

If after a few beers you fancy a dance, you should visit Clwb ifor bach which is on the same street. It's the only nightclub in the world where barstaff are required to be fluent in both English and Welsh. They have 3 floors, each playing vastly different music, so you can mix and match between genres. 

As far as tourist-y stuff goes, the castle is definitely worth a look, and the museum is pretty interesting. Also make sure you have a stroll around the Arcades. There's a lot of independently owned shops, including Spillers Records which has a claim to being the oldest record store in the world.

You didn't want a Vita. (Presumably you have one since you were ordering a Vita game). You didn't pay for a Vita. You were sent a Vita. Clearly, there has been a mistake.

Once you decide to keep the Vita that you haven't ordered and didn't pay for, it's theft, plain and simple. They've even asked for it back.

Just because something lands in your letterbox doesn't make it yours, the same way that if someone mis-directs a bank transfer into your account the money doesn't magically become yours.

Too many people want to profit from  simple mistakes, with the attitude ""it's their look out, their loss, plus they're a big company and I don't like big companies and they can afford it so this PS Vita should be Free"".

Regarding the PR, well, they should ask for it back, arrange couriering at cost, and then perhaps credit the honest customer with a £20 voucher or something, plus the game they actually ordered for the inconvenience.

This happened to me once: I ordered an iPod from Dabs, they sent me one, then a few days later a second arrived. Did I think ""woo free ipod?"" no, I contacted them and sent it back. I hadn't paid for it, it wasn't mine, I returned it.
