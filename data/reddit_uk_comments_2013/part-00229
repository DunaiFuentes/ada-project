true,Yurilovescats,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"There's three aspect to prison - punishment, security for the public and rehabilitation. 

Prison works as a punishment, and provides public security for as long as the offender locked up, yet is an abysmal failure at rehabilitation. I agree reform needs to happen as ultimately rehabilitation provides the best long-term solution for society. However, this doesn't mean we should completely forget about punishment and public security... and community orders provide neither. It's also questionable whether it would really aid rehabilitation, as the offender will still exist in the same environment that led to the offending, and may only pay lip-service to any court-imposed requirements (and obviously people can only be monitored for a limited amount of time).

Personally, If I were to design a new system, I'd keep prisons but turn them into secure schools where inmates are given 35 hours a week in training/counseling on how to deal with the outside world without breaking the law. Of course this would cost billions of pounds to implement and billions more to run, and such long-term social planning with high start-up costs is something democracies really struggle to do when the only important thing for politicians is the next financial report and the next election... especially when there's a risk attached that it may not even work. Yet this is a direction I would like to see our prison system move towards, even if it takes decades.

Simply introducing more community orders, as Vicky Pryce suggests, forfeits security and punishment for what may only be a negligible increase in rehabilitation. Also, her focus on female offenders (even accepting that was all she came across in her experience) is absurd. Male offenders have just as many emotional and pschological issues as female offenders and form a much, much larger part of our prison community. While single mothers of young children do provide a different problem, which obviously needs consideration when sentencing (which, if I understand correctly, already happens) there's no other reason why female offenders should be a special focus or receive less prison time. 

While it's always good to have prison reform on the public's radar, to me Vicky Pryce comes across as saying women should avoid prison because it's personally inconvenient to them.

true,hermithome,dalek,Dalek,"Right, which would have made sense if it didn't show during the night when Amy opened the Pandorica. The museum closed, Amy hung around til evening and opened the Pandorica. And when they went outside she said:

AMY: What, it's morning already? How did that happen?  
DOCTOR: History is shrinking. Is anybody listening to me? The universe is collapsing. We don't have much time left.  
RORY: What are you doing?  
DOCTOR: Looking for the Tardis.  
RORY: But the Tardis exploded.  
DOCTOR: Okay then, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.  
AMY: I don't understand. So, the Tardis blew up and took the universe with it. But why would it do that? How?  
DOCTOR: Good question for another day. The question for now is, total event collapse means that every star in the universe never happened. Not one single one of them ever shone. So, if all the stars that ever were are gone, then what is that?  
(A large burning ball in the sky.)  
DOCTOR: Like I said, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.  
RORY: But that's the sun.  
DOCTOR: Is it? Well, here's the noise that sun is making right now.  
(The Tardis noise.)  
DOCTOR: That's my Tardis burning up. That's what's been keeping the Earth warm.  


Okay, there are no stars, so the TARDIS has been functioning as one. That part makes sense, except when it's night and the TARDIS is still burning. Now you can use the explanation of history shrinking. So night happened but it was only a few seconds or minutes. But if that's true, then Rory didn't wait for 2000, he waited for drastically less because time was shrinking. It also doesn't make the earlier scenes with Amy and the night sky make much sense. If night was only a few moments that last night, then it certainly wasn't normal the night before, or the month before or the year before. Hell, I'm not even sure how Amy was able to see the stars given how brief the nightime was. If you buy the explanation of history shrinking, then Rory didn't wait 2000 years and Amy being able to see the stars and the stars being an issue at all doesn't make a lot of sense. If you ignore that because 2000 years is romantic and Amy remembering another universe is romantic and destiny then you have to confront the fact that the TARDIS didn't work precisely like a sun. Maybe it was bigger or maybe the Earth didn't orbit it, who knows.

All I'm saying is that when you actually pay attention to what's going on it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Also, Rory having memories of ancient Rome etc, that are compatible with the Doctors makes no sense either. You saw that museum. Races erased from existence, penguins in the Nile but sure, the rise and fall of specific countries is still the same? Riiight.

&gt;**Results.** Post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with lower rank, being unmarried, having low educational
attainment and a history of childhood adversity. Exposure to potentially traumatizing events, in particular being
deployed to a ‘forward’ area in close contact with the enemy, was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms.
Appraisals of the experience as involving threat to one’s own life and a perception that work in theatre was above an
individual’s trade and experience were strongly associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. Low morale and poor
social support within the unit and non-receipt of a home-coming brief (psycho-education) were associated with greater
risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms.

&gt;**Conclusions.** Personal appraisal of threat to life during the trauma emerged as the most important predictor of posttraumatic
stress symptoms. These results also raise the possibility that there are important modifiable occupational
factors such as unit morale, leadership, preparing combatants for their role in theatre which may influence an individual’s
risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Therefore interventions focused on systematic preparation of personnel
for the extreme stress of combat may help to lessen the psychological impact of deployment.

**This has no delineation for people under 25.**  In fact it shows that the &lt;25 group has similar percentage of PTSD as those in the 25-29.  We have too few data points (1003/57,1105/48) to have a statistical significance between the groups either.

&gt;This strikes me as buyer's regret more than anything else, 

Yes it certainly is and that is because you are certainly too young at 16 to be able to make such a life changing decision. 



&gt;The video uses ""striking"" statistics such as: ""We're the only EU country that recruits minors."" which is a bit rich considering a lot of those EU countries have conscription which forces military service upon all of their (at least male) population when they turn 18. So would you prefer that 16 &amp; 17yos be able to **choose** to join the military or would you prefer that you and your kids would be **legally obligated** to at 18?

That is just a complete false dichotomy. Why not neither?


&gt;The video tries to intimate that we're recruiting ""child soldiers"" by comparing us to South American, Asian &amp; African countries. What? There are differences the world over with a bunch of things, Americans can drive before us, does that mean they want all their kids to die in car crashes? We can drink earlier than Americans, does that mean we want all of our kids to become alcoholics? Sweden's age of consent is 14, does that mean it's a country of paedophiles?

They're all completely specious comparisons. No one's saying we're trying to make a nation of child soldiers. Just simply that 16 is too young to be recruited into the army. 


&gt;The PTSD thing is wild and quite insulting to try to connect it to the age that someone joins, as if you become magically immune to mental illness on your 18th birthday.

It's not wild and insulting to connect it to age, it's just the truth. Many studies have shown there is a clear link between age and susceptibility to PTSD. [This Kings College one for example.](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/publications/assetfiles/iraqafghan/Iversen2008-riskfactorsptsd.pdf) 



&gt;He belittles the educational opportunities within the military despite not understanding them (he acts like a survival NVQ is the only thing available), when in reality it's a pathway for a bunch of people would *never* get a formal education to get serious qualifications under their belt whilst they're still earning and doing what they enjoy. Not to mention the opportunities to learn a trade that will make you set for a life in many of the available jobs.


&gt;They make no effort whatsoever to explain the potential benefits of service. Leaving aside all of the emotional stuff of ""doing your duty"" or ""doing something that matters"", the military presents an opportunity for people to earn a (relatively) decent living, a great pension, useful life skills, the ability to travel the world, have unbridled fun, earn qualifications and form lifelong bonds/experiences.


&gt;More importantly than that is the sorts of people who often end up in the military, especially on the ""Enlisted"" end; these are people who would quite often be your dole-wallowing chav, getting drunk or high every day and causing trouble, these are people who often come from abject poverty or a bad upbringing. The armed forces give them purpose, a way out and drags them up to become productive, honourable members of society by teaching respect, restraint and how to conduct yourself - traits that make them a better person for the rest of his or her life.

That's all great and I'm sure the army does a lot of good for a lot of people but that's not the point of the video. The point is whether kids should be recruited at the age of 16.

true,devineman,logo,,"It's not a circlejerk, he's just not shown any evidence that he is good enough to play for us in the Premier League.  

He doesn't read the game as well as Barry, doesn't defend as well as Fernandinho and doesn't create as much as Yaya.

He's one of those players that I look at and just don't see the point of him.  He recognise that he can control a ball and I recognise that he's alright at possession rotation.  He's good (but a bit overrated) in the air.  Aside from this he has the football IQ of a courgette, is mentally weak, has no variation in his pace thus is entirely predictable to strikers, is pretty awful at going to ground and defends like he's wearing ice skates.

As a midfielder he was constantly beaten on the turn and aside from winning headers from an opposing goal kick, I couldn't tell you what his ""job"" in the squad was.  The lad must be incredible at making a brew or something.

I think my problem is that I don't understand him.  We have better options in almost every trait of his and he's not one of those ""pretty decent at everything"" steady hand types.  I think he was bought hoping he'd be the player he was at Benfica and instead we got the player he was at Madrid.

I don't think any City fan, no matter how lopsided, would actually cause a fuss if he went in January.  As I pointed out to HyperactiveToast elsewhere in this thread, I couldn't even name 3 good games he's had in his City career and he's been here for a little while now.  He was decent away at West Ham this year.  His debut might be seen by some to have been ""good"" (though he nearly cost us the game at the end so there's a debate there).  After that I'm struggling to think of a time where I walked down the street post-match and heard people say ""Wow, Garcia had a great game today!"".

Again, my problem here is comprehension.  I don't understand the point of him.   I don't understand what he brings to the table that is deserving of a ~£100k a week salary out of the Club's pockets.  I don't understand why he is a ""special player"".  It's not like he has the guts or determination to make up for his failings in other areas.

He seems to me to be the Pepsi of players.  If you asked for Coke and someone gave you a Pepsi, you are unlikely to kick up a fuss because it's acceptable and a decent product.  You'd half think ""huh, they gave me Pepsi"" then carry on with the billion vastly more important things in your day.  But when you get a proper chilled Coca-Cola in a glass bottle, you wonder why you ever accepted Pepsi as an alternative.

We're the richest and best paying Club on the face of the Earth.  We play in the most prestigious league and the most prestigious continental competition on the face of the Earth and we are looking at challenging for both.  We are a forward looking Club with new ideas to old challenges with a coach that players often say they enjoy playing for.  And we serve Pepsi instead of Coke.

As I say, he's one of those players that just doesn't ""fit"".  He's not talented enough to play for us, he's not the required quality of a team in the top four and doesn't have that ""fight"" that can often make up for lack of talent.

A bit more on topic, this statistic is essentially bunkum as Nastasic is 6th despite playing 2 games more and executing over 100 more passes.  All it means is that City's centre backs are playing very safe balls and attempting to pass shorter which is nice to know but little reflection on either Garcia or Nastasic as footballers.",0,1383133197,null,0,false,0,cd2u6kg,t3_1pgcyt,t1_cd2u6kg,t1_cd2m42l,null,1428927667,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

Manufactured from corn, and known as HFCS in the states. There's a lot of debate over potential adverse health effects of this product, and is used instead of or in addition to sucrose (sugar beet/cane sugar). It's cheaper.

Naturally present in fruit, though sometimes added in afterwards if the way the fruit has been processed results in it being absent from the recipe. Most times, it's made from fruit. This controls acidity, flavour, and preserves the fruit.

Controls acidity in the product for preservation and flavour.

Pectin, which is an important ingredient in Jam. If the fruit being preserved is not naturally high in pectin, other fruit pectin may be added. It's very likely that your Nan used shop-bought pectin to help make the jam.

I can't tell you how many times we've had the local coppers around to pick up dropped or tossed bags of weed, pills, heroin and half empty methadone containers. 

Providing places for addicts to go for a safe high, and maybe where they can find information on cleaning up and not be judged?

My point is, if every day counts so much, why do schools close so much easier than every other job/institution when slightly adverse weather comes into play? And possibly more importantly, make no effort to catch back up with lessons either in holidays or weekends or the like?

If its too snowy for everyone/a large number of people to get into work, fine. But how many times have we seem every place of work that isn't a school open, and half of all schools closed?

To use your analogy, if someone didn't get into work during a vital period due to weather, I'm sure they'd be expected to work it back.

So they are looking to minimise the amount of time that kids take out of school. It makes no sense at all to say ""Oh well, they closed the school due to snow, this is some sort of reason for **more** time out of education."" 

I would also object to the idea that the work is not made up. They may not do more time, but the teacher will certainly plan to ensure that the curriculum is covered by reorganising their lesson plans. It's far easier to do that, incidentally, if the entire class has been taught the same material, rather than having to cater for individuals who may or may not be taking holidays at different times.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I'll start:

&gt;Holtby vs Eriksen, who do you believe should be starting in the EPL based on current form?

I'm quite happy to flip a coin. I fully expect over the course of a season or two Eriksen will make the 10 jersey his own, but at the moment Holtby has been quite impressive and looks to be the only one capable of unlocking defences. It is a good problem to have, whilst Eriksen settles in at the club and in the system Holtby can take the reigns. Squad competition is helpful and this is a place where we need it.

&gt;Who would you like to see getting game time at LW and why? 

I am a Siggy fan, there is a reason that he is our second highest goal scorer this season (and highest from open play). Whilst the team is struggling to find the back of the net it makes sense to play the guy who is knocking them in. In saying that, I think a lack of width is certainly a cause for concern. I believe we are most dangerous with Rose/Walker providing width on attack and Siggy/Townsend moving into the channels. Whilst Rose is currently out injured I would like to see Chadli start a game at LW (perhaps in EL or cup first) as he is a natural LW and could create space for Eriksen/Paulinho to operate in.

&gt;Is Soldado out of form, or playing as expected (4 goals, 2 assists in 8 games started. 3 of those are penalties however)?

I think Soldado is playing very well, 2 goals and 2 assists in his last 4 games (including against Chelsea) is good return for a striker, especially one playing in front of a team struggling to click offensively. I do expect him to find more goals as the team matures. In my opinion it is no coincidence that the one game he didn't start was the battering by West Ham.

&gt;Out of the new signings, who has impressed you the most?

Capoue was impressing in his minutes before injury and Chiriches has looked great with limited time. Of the players who have had serious game time I would say Paulinho, my only issue is that he is a like-for-like replacement for Dembele and whilst he is great, he isn't adding a lot of stuff we didn't already have with Dembele. I was hoping for a bit more flare and creativity and instead we seem to have another defensively solid unit who struggles to unlock defences. I am perhaps being a bit harsh on him.

&gt;Thoughts on the loan system and the success of young prospects Rose and Townsend?

It is great to see two loan prospects graduate to the starting 11. Ideally the likes of Smith, Kane and Carroll can land PL loans next season and follow in the previously mentioned players footsteps. A PL loan looks to be the perfect litmus test for young players wishing to crack the squad.

&gt;How should Lamela be integrated into the team?

true,organisation,null,null,"Regulation is not a solid definition in relation to a profession. There is statutory regulation of, say, doctors, lawyers and accountants. This means the very process of becoming a professional is artificially controlled and before they are let loose on the public they have had to satisfy state requirements. Then there is regulation of different aspects of a job, such as health and safety, trade description, employment law, electrical safety, tax returns etc etc. And there is also another form of control over a particular trade or profession, such as local licensing, insurance (public liability, product liability) and so on which are not always laws but influence aspects such as training requirements. 

You'll find some professions may not have statutory regulation like doctors but they have to comply with a hell of a lot of statutory law (some of it pretty stupid, the red tape you often hear about in the press, but that's beside the issue). 

Pick any profession out of the air and you'll find a different mix of law, licenses, training requirements and so on. Some will have very little, others have absolutely loads of requirements. While statutory regulation is seen as the very pinnacle of protecting the public, that's not actually what it's about and what it's meant to do. It's more to do with the consequences of letting absolutely anyone enter that particular profession (depending on your political point of view that's either good or bad e.g. libertarians would probably feel absolutely anyone should be able to train as a dentist and enter the market). 

So when terms like self-regulation and unregulated are thrown around this is actually very misleading. There are very few professions that don't have at least some part of their work under statutory regulation. For the press this (currently) is criminal law. 

The idea of a royal charter is to come up with statutory regulation, and it simply can't work because absolutely ANYONE can enter the profession. It's going to be close to impossibly to regulate everything journalists do (e.g. what about paid for puff pieces?)A royal charter can be used against those who don't sign up to it, so a blogger (or maybe even us) can be pursued if we fit their definition of a journalist.

There's this tendency to just go ""Yes *but*..."" but there's no but, you can't have just a little bit of regulation of speech. We're not talking about regulating the width of railway lines here. It's a fundamental human right. I've got every sympathy for someone like Coogan who really got it in the neck from the Mail or those who have been horribly smeared. Statutory regulation is not about exacting revenge, and that's what it's being used for.

I'm concerned it all just comes down to money rather than convenience.

If you decide that the £400 you'd save on a term-time holiday is more than the worth of 1 week's education (including the implicit cost of child care and feeding during school hours) for your child, then so be it, but we all know you won't be supplementing their education in that time.

And do you really want to spend that extra week with your child? After all the fuss you make about the Summer Holidays being murder?

Schools close for far less snow than they used to. The only time our school ever closed when I went back in the 70's and early 80s was when the heating packed up. It never once closed because there was a foot or two of snow on the ground let alone a few inch dusting as they do now.

true,spursaw,null,null,"&gt; Holtby vs Eriksen, who do you believe should be starting in the EPL based on current form?

Eriksen as he has better movement off the ball, is quicker at moving the ball than Holtby and has a better first choice and turn of pace to get away from his marker. I am a big Holtby fan though, don't get me wrong.

&gt; Who would you like to see getting game time at LW and why? Chadli/Siggurdson/Lennon/Townsend/Holtby/Eriksen/Kane have all seen at least some minutes there this season

I'm not a fan of Siggy on the wing, his goals hid largely anonymous performances and the extent to his anonymity has been shown in recent games where he hasn't scored. And if Rose isn't playing then he shouldn't be playing there in my opinion. My first choice would eventually be to shift Townsend (Townsends dad has stated that this is still his best position) over to the left and Lamela on the right. In the meantime with Lamela still getting used to the PL, It's hard to say who should be playing there. TBH I think that whoever impresses most there vs Hull today then the left-wing spot will be there's vs Everton

&gt; Is Soldado ut of form, or playing as expected (4 goals, 2 assists in 8 games started. 3 of those are penalties however)?

Hes being good the last two games.. Wether or not he will have being worth 26 million is yet to be seen

&gt; Out of the new signings, who has impressed you the most (Chiriches, Capoue, Paulinho, Chadli, Soldado and Lamela)?

In order: 1. Eriksen 2. Capoue 3. Paulinho 4. Chiriches 5. Soldado 6. Chadli 7. Lamela

&gt; Thoughts on the loan system and the success of young prospects Rose and Townsend?

There were a lot of idiot Spurs 'fans' on here who had an irrational dislike for Rose however he has well and truly shut them up.. Hes a very good player IMO. As for Townsend, WOW, he seems to get better every single game

&gt; How should Lamela be integrated into the team?

If he impresses enough in the cup competitions then he will get time in the PL.. I would like to also see Townsend moved to the left with Lamela on the right for the last 20 minutes or so of a few PL games to see how it works

Answers:

* Holtby and Eriksen are both in good form, and they both make excellent contributions. What has been noticeable lately is Eriksen's propensity to lose confidence - it can be seen in his face and shoulders. I think they should continue switching at AVB's discretion.

* The wings are difficult to watch, because AVB likes the inverted style and our players seem to struggle with this. Both Siggy and Town seem to perform best with this, but they don't confuse the D. I'd like to see Lamela LW with Lennon RW just once, with Soldado on point. But without Rose at LB, maybe Holtby is the only one quick enough to fill the role. Kane is a striker, isn't he? Maybe he should get some cup time in that position...

* Soldado is not out of form. Sometimes he doesn't run fast enough for a pass, but maybe he sees an offsides situation where I don't. However, Soldado's difficulty is the same as the rest of the team. Communication breakdown. HE HAS OUTSTANDING PLACEMENT... but nobody finds him with a pass. The Holtby-Paulinho-Soldado goal v. AV was an etude of his style, but notice how the opposition was misdirected. That is what the rest of the team needs to work on: communication and misdirecion.

* All of our new signings have impressed me in one way or another. I'm a bit disappointed with results, but this is more because they still have to acclimate.

* Our loan system seems to be getting results for us; no complaints there.

* Lamela is easily pushed around, and it may be just about size. He works hard and contributes practically everywhere though. I'd like to see him at LW with Soldado because I think he'll get some confidence from link-up play in his natural position.

I think his ability is just better than Holtby right now, and I think the more first team minutes he gets, the better. I'd like to see Lamela and Townsend take the wings. Right now, it doesn't seem like Lamela is settled properly, for whatever reason. Even if language is the barrier, I would think he could develop an understanding on the pitch with the rest of the side. I think Soldado is fine. I think his production will come last, as a result of the squad getting some chemistry in the build up, and then with Soldado up top. I don't have a problem with what he's done so far. Miles better than JD. As for new signings, I have to say its a tie between Paulinho and Eriksen. Although Eriksen hasn't exactly dine much, things like that flick to Lennon show his obvious quality. Paulinho, while a very similar player to Mousa, seems to be first choice for that spot right now. Considering how crucial Mousa was to our year last season, that alone is enough to put him near the top if my list. Also, one thing I think he does noticeably better than Dembele is to get into goal scoring positions. He makes some great runs into the box. I love that Rose and Townsend have found places in the squad. Townsend, after looking like a right sided JD for the first match or two, seems to have found a good balance between cutting and shooting, and is almost the default MOTM for us with how dangerous he his for the entirety of the match. Rose impressed before his injury, putting to rest a lot of doubts that he was good enough to be our starting LB.

If only Muslims named themselves after one man, and aimed to dress like him an emulate him in every way possible. Then we could look at that mans life and see that he was a slave raping, gay murdering, paedophile.

Ignoring your gross simplification for a moment, I think you will find that most people who believe the EDL should be destroyed (myself included) believe that it is because, despite what their former leader believes, they are mostly a bunch of [violent hooligans](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22636991) who despite denouncing the behaviour of radical Islamic individuals use [exactly](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-16098897) the [same](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-23059542) methods to [make](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-24366342) their point. Remember hearing about the mosque who invited Tommy Robinson to have a civil discussion how to deal with the extremists? That is what needs to be done to combat radicals &amp;mdash; not attacking the police, not blind hate, not vandalising mosques, not beating up people for being Muslim. If we fight between ourselves like we have been doing then it makes it easier for radical individuals to win.

&gt;The UAF enjoy wide support from Lefties, and often have much much more support in their anti-EDL marches than the EDL gets. Now of course you have your excuse that not every person on the Left is like this. But an awful lot are. And the ones who are are louder.

Actually no. He said ""we could surely win but it'll be because we played well not because they were tired."" which, like it or not, infers that there is no real advantage to playing a team tired after a midweek game. You then go on to cite the OP's argument, but you clearly haven't understood where he's coming from. At no point does he say we ""have an advantage AND THEREFORE a win""? In fact he doesn't even state his position, he just asks a question! I'm the one saying that this gives Livepool advantage, not necessarily over Arsenal but over a Liverpool team who got to play a rested Arsenal team w/out a midweek game. At no point imply that this alone will give us the win.. 

&gt; Therefore, we should not approach this game as if it will be any easier nor as if we have an advantage.

I have never said otherwise. *OF COURSE* we should approach the game the same.. It's a very small advantage but it's tangible non-the-less (read the book *Soccernomics*). 

&gt;Statistics are nice, but each game is an independent event.

And finally with this overarching statement you've made I can only assume you've put zero thought into it. Each game is absolutely not an independent event, there are lots of factors that come into play, especially in the context that we're talking. Form, tiredness, morale etc etc all effected by previous matches can change making it dependant to some degree.

I know it's boring (especially on TV in the States), but results lead to excitement, no? 

We kind of fell in love with the idea of inverted wingers when Bale was scoring for fun on the right. Especially without the overlapping of Rose, I'd like us to keep some width in the midfield since we lack Bale's firepower at the moment (no offense, Andros).  I'm also really curious as to how playing soldado or defoe off of Ade might work against some teams if the 4-2-3-1 isn't working. 

I do kind of agree with AVB's comments though...we can certainly be more supportive and louder in general at home. We see it against the top sides and in certain derbies, so I'm not sure if the argument of ""higher prices = shutting out the younger, louder fans"" is that valid... it's just a sense of entitlement that teams like Hull will roll over.

true,paulineypw,null,null,"My main issue with the top comment you mention is the declaration ""holidays aren't essential"". How is this unessential ""holiday"" defined? 

I know school children do have school holidays, but this just means a day off school. The sense that the article means however (and that we all mean when we say we need a holiday, we're booking a holiday) is a break away from home, of recreation or relaxation. When this teacher who has commented says ""holidays are not essential"" I think she is being very short-sighted: it is not that everyone needs to go to Florida or Spain for a week or 2, but everyone does need a break from their every day circumstances. The school holidays are a break from school but for those on a low income, they are not a break from the every day.

The simple fact is that there millions of families that can't afford a break away from home at any time, let alone during the peak school holiday times when breaks even just to caravan sites are 3 x as expensive. These are the people that arguably need one most and yet have little chance of accessing one, and even less now they need to have exceptional circumstances to go off peak. A break away from home, even just to your local campsite, has HUGE benefits especially for children who are still learning about the world, and until we break this trap of ""can't afford a peak break"" + ""can't go out of season"" = ""can't have a break at all"", these benefits will only be enjoyed by the rich. I know education is important, and I'm obviously not advocating failing exams to always be on holiday, but schools/the government needs to be more lenient and respect the positives a break can have too.

Totally ignores the thousands of officers from wealthy backgrounds, totally ignores the many charities doing amazing work with veterans, especially those with ptsd and physically injuries. It totally ignores the amount of effort that has been put in to the armed forces in the last few decades towards ""warm down"" periods post-op, facilities and improved training, much of which has been funded from charities set up, supported and run by wealthy people. Not to mention the vast sums of money invested in countering IEDs, developing new counterinsurgency techniques as well as investing in a new fleet of vehicles designed for the region (squaddies are no longer driving around in snatch landrovers that offer less protection than sardine cans). 

The whole idea that if you have a large bank balance, you are somehow automatically a callous evil Mr burns seeking only to be richer no matter what human suffering you cause is just lazy. It is an easy target that has little basis in reality and serves only as the go to argument for people trying to sound intelligent through being cynical as though they are ""world weary"" and ""experienced"". I would hope you are better than that.

And the point is completely discredited in that that criticism is not being levelled fairly against other organisations who target young people towards other more dangerous and less well paid professions, and the video's authors are evidently okay with them doing it. It seems to me that they are unfairly targeting the army, who by the standards of their own criticism are nowhere near as bad as some others. If the authors are okay with other companies being more unethical, it seems to me that there must be a specific ulterior motive to target the army over the other companies, which they are surprisingly not mentioning.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"There is an argument to be made that if someone is on social benefits for a long period, then they need to be given some work so that they will have something to do, get back into the routine of having a job and society as a whole will benefit from their contribution.

But surely, if they do work, and get money for doing the work (and don't get money if they don't do the work), then aren't they now *employed* by the government and should be given minimum wage? What the fuck is the point of a minimum wage if people are effectively working for less than it?

This is made 100 times worse by the fact that the government is forcing people to work at *private companies* to get their benefits. So now we have people paid *less than minimum wage* by the *government*, working as *free labour* for a private company.

Essentially, the **taxpayers are paying for the labour costs of private companies**, and not only that, we're paying a really fucking unfair wage too!

Even on the most basic conceptual level this doesn't make any sense!

It might make sense if, for example, the work schemes were only for government funded jobs, and the workers only worked part-time for the number of hours where hours worked x min wage = benefits received.

That way, they're working, they're contributing, they're paid minimum wage. The government is spending the same money that would be spent as benefits anyway, but now getting a bit more labour in return.

They also won't undercut full-time government employees since they are effectively on the same hourly wage.

I may just be in dreamland here but I really feel that Champions League is ATTAINABLE. It will be insanely hard but with a good move in January and some luck along with avoiding the injury bug, this team can do it. Just think about the season up to right now, we are 4 points out of first, we already beat Chelsea, with the addition of Lukaku I can see us turning more potential draws into wins. With United struggling and a sense of Liverpool stagnating (drawing against a 10 man Newcastle!) I can totally see us battling it out with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham (who I think will see trouble in the second half of the season due to being stretched thin by Europe). But this is again, me being very optimistic and it is still very very early in the season. If we are sitting at 4th or higher by the beginning of January, I will have more confidence that we will contend for a Champions League spot. And looking at the fixtures up to January, I see if we get a win and a draw out of Tottenham and Liverpool and then two draws away at Arsenal and United, (hopefully a win at Swansea) then we will be sitting very nicely in the tables. *forgot to mention City.

true,wiggin50,num22-away,,"&gt; Holtby vs Eriksen, who do you believe should be starting in the EPL based on current form?

I love Holtby more, but Eriksen can be just so brilliant. I wouldn't mind seeing both of them play together in front of a destroyer. Of course the issue there is you leave out Dembele and Paulinho, two very good players we definitely want one of whom starting. For now, keep rotating, make em fight for the chance to play the big matches. I think AVB is handling this situation well. 

&gt; Who would you like to see getting game time at LW and why? Chadli/Siggurdson/Lennon/Townsend/Holtby/Eriksen/Kane have all seen at least some minutes there this season (inc EL/Cups).

If Rose is back, Siggy starts on the left, if not Chadli. OR Townsend on the left, Lennon on the right (untill Lamela hits form, then put him in front of Lennon). 

&gt; Is Soldado out of form, or playing as expected (4 goals, 2 assists in 8 games started. 3 of those are penalties however)?

He hasn't hid his stride obviously, but that is partially a team problem, and we may not really see him at his best until next season (see Olivier Giroud). I'd like to see him try and create for himself more, but I understand that's not really his game. Its nice to have someone we know will score from the spot reliably. All in all, I withhold judgement on Soldado until the year is out. 

&gt; Out of the new signings, who has impressed you the most (Eriksen [sic] Chiriches, Capoue, Paulinho, Chadli, Soldado and Lamela)?

In order of least to most: Lamela, Soldado, Chadli, Capoue, Eriksen, Chiriches, Paulinho. Based on return on what we paid for them.

&gt; Thoughts on the loan system and the success of young prospects Rose and Townsend?

Its working as intended. Rose and Townsend are great success stories, and I can see Carroll and Kane joining them in that list. (Kane should get another loan, and given a chance in the first team next year after we sell Ade or Defoe)

&gt; How should Lamela be integrated into the team?

Slowly, i.e. Lloris last year. Things aren't looking good right now, but I hope he gets to play tonight against Hull and puts in a good shift.

true,kingaardvark,crest,,"Honestly I gave Naismith another chance after his performance against Chelsea, but his technical ability is atrocious. His first touch lets him down so often, and his pass accuracy this season would probably be around 50%. Yes he does work hard, but to little effect. Watch him defensively when he tracks back, he makes a terrible attempt at a tackle and wastes his energy. I agree he gets scapegoated too often, as very rarely does his individual mistake lead to conceding a goal or chance for the opposition to score, but he is not of a good enough standard to be playing for us. It's not one mistake, it's a catalogue of them over a game. Working hard does not make him a good player.

I've watched every game this season and Mirallas has been a bright spark in few games. He is obviously a very good player as he shows occasionally, but he's not been anywhere near as consistently good this season.

I believe the difficulty we're having now in our opinions is in our belief of defense of the individual over the overall safety of the whole. To be more specific, you are advocating that everyone should want to protect themselves and the government shouldn't try and get in the way of that. However, the crunch comes when you consider that the UK (for example) might have the mindset where self-defense of the individual does not justify the escalation of violence that would happen should everyone have access to a weapon.
    
You called it 'nannying' earlier. The problem with this is perspective. You may consider it nannying because you place importance on the individual and believe each should be allowed to make their own decisions. However, from the perspective of the collective (am I starting to sound like a communist?!), we acknowledge that giving 'individuals' access to guns would also give those without moral conscience access to guns as well. 
    
I'm not explaining this very well, am I? I think the easiest way for me to summarize this is by saying that importance here is placed on the collective safety rather than individual safety. Sure, some individuals might suffer, but overall, the level of violence is less.
    
Finally, because the collective mindset seems to be on the collective in the UK (judging by the lack of dissension they show towards this particular law), nobody minds sacrificing the safety of a few to ensure less violence for the many.

Siggy does the same thing, its not to say Siggy can't do a shift when need be, but its not his strong suit and putting him out on the wing isn't playing to his strengths.

I agree that at the moment Lamela and Townsend would be the ideal combination on the wings.  If Lamela can find his form i think we will see this.  In the meantime i think we need to give more looks to Lennon/Chadli along with Lamela on the left to see if one of them can spark something for us.

I said before on here that against the lower teams (league cup, relegation zone teams etc.)  i would actually love to see us try mixing the midfield up a little by putting Eriksen in the middle with either Holtby or Siggy and someone like Paulinho in the holding role.  It would put more pressure on our defense (which has been our strength) but may open some more scoring opportunities for us.

I don't know what the solution is though, that is why we pay AVB.  My thought is that when Rose returns it opens up some options at LW because you don't need a box-to-box winger when Rose can push up.  Instead you can have a possession/playmaker like Sigurdsson out there to assist Eriksen/Holtby in getting service to Soldado.  And you get to keep Townsend for cutting runs and long shots. 

I also feel like we are still dealing with a team learning how to play together.  It always seems like there is hesitation to pass into tight spaces.  Everyone seems more content to shoot from distance rather than risk givin up possession.  

I also fault Soldado a bit because he's got to try to open up space some, even if risky.  Townsend shooting from 50yards away is just as wasteful as Soldado trying to break away from two defenders and losing possession.

This was most obvious against West Ham where we had a right footed LB (Naughton) paired with a right footed LW (Siggy). We had absolutely nobody getting chalk on their boots on the left which forced the team to try and brute force their way through the middle (with Defoe as the target...). On the other side Townsend was inverted which only made the problem worse.

I think when Rose returns he can continue to be his aggressive self which will draw the opposition RB out wide, giving our LW/CAM/ST room to work in. Until then IMO Chadli deserves a shout, he is a natural LW and just by being on the pitch will stretch the opposition. I don't rate Lennon much, but having him on the right pins back the full back at the very least creating space.

It's crazy to think about how different the team looks now compared to when we last played Wigan a few months back. Mbia won't be around to drop those scary free kicks, but remy isn't there to pull a worldie out the bag either.

Following the outcome of the last two matches, I hope they've re-evaluated the tactics a little. I sincerely hope is that Jenas doesn't feature in the starting 11 tonight. I think I would stick with Henry to screen Hill and Dunne. I don't think Wigan have any kind of partnership like the one between Vokes and Ings, but I might be wrong there...I haven't paid a lot of attention to them. I'd like to see Phillips, SWP or Faurlin get a look in too. If Holt starts for them, Barton's absence might be a blessing - I can imagine a penalty concession if those two clashed. If AJ is indeed healthy once again, I hope he's traveled with the team. His work rate could work wonders as an impact sub, and relieve pressure on Austin, who I can unfortunately imagine still lacking decent service.

If we have to go 4-5-1 again, I'd try a starting lineup of Henry, Kranjcar and Faurlin in the middle with Phillips and SWP on the wings. My concern would be whether Kranjcar and Faurlin could shoulder the lion's share of creativity in the middle though. Maybe Henry was right and we really are badly missing Carroll. I really hope Onuoha heals up soon - then we can perhaps ease up on the extra cover from the middle, swap Henry out for someone more dynamic or throw on the extra man up front.

I'd love to win this game as revenge. The atmosphere was so cold when they scored that equaliser at the death against us back in April.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Britain planned to build a **Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters** in southern Afghanistan, as part of a top-secret deal to make them swap sides...The camp would also have provided **vocational training, including farming and irrigation techniques**, to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium.

&gt; But the Afghan government took issue with **plans to provide military training**, to turn the insurgents into a defence force.
Afghan government staff also claimed the “EU peace-builders” had handed over **mobile phones, laptops and airtime credit** to insurgents. They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use **secure satellite phones**, so they could communicate directly with UK officials.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/revealed-british-plan-to-build-training-camp-for-taliban-fighters-in-afghanistan-777671.html

&gt; Nato forces mistakenly **supplied food, water and arms to Taliban forces** in southern Afghanistan, officials today admitted.
Containers destined for local police forces were **dropped from a helicopter into a Taliban-controlled area** of Zabul province.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/18/nato.afghanistan

&gt; MI6′s meetings with the Taliban took place **up to half a dozen times** at houses on the outskirts of Lashkah Gah and in villages in the Upper Gereshk valley, to the north-east of Helmand’s main town. The compounds were **surrounded by a force of British infantry** providing a security cordon.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573687/Britain-in-secret-talks-with-the-Taliban.html

&gt; In August 2007, the presidents of Afghanistan and Tajikistan walked side by side with the U.S. commerce secretary across a new **$37 million concrete bridge** that the Army Corps of Engineers designed to link two of Central Asia’s poorest countries.

&gt; Today, the bridge across the muddy waters of the Panj River is carrying much more than vegetables and timber: It’s **paved the way for drug traffickers to transport larger loads of Afghan heroin and opium** to Central Asia and beyond to Russia and Western Europe.

Mo does a programme where the pitch is he meets a bigot to confront him and show him they ain't all bad. The bigot says he doesn't actually hate them per-see just finds their ideology if read in an literal way backward and unsuitable for his culture. During interviews and meetings the bigot meets with other moderates who convince him he's actually moderate, not a bigot, and so he leaves a group he founded to be more moderate and work through dialogue rather than protests or violence.

I assume that Mr Robinson's perspective is that he and Mo met at two extremes and rather than bringing each other to the centre Tommy met other people who eloquently voiced views he already had and Mo remained the same extremist he always was. So it wasn't Mo who changed his mind it was meeting people through Mo who did. At least in terms of how I saw it, the doc was clearly coming from Mo's perspective so it elevates the few visits he did and relegates what actually convinced Tommy to leave the EDL to a single line voice over whist on a close up of Mo.

I am not aware of a single scheme that would have even read the rest of your application beyond the degree result. And that is even more likely to be the case in this environment.  Furthermore, something like 95% of the jobs you're looking for are based in London. [Baillie Gifford](http://www.bailliegifford.com/) are the only asset managers i can think of right now based in Scotland.  But that doesn't mean there aren't any, just that i can't think of them.

I'm sorry that this is not what you want to hear.  unfortunately, you are trying to break into a highly competitive and well-paid industry, and a lower degree result is an easy way to reduce the list of 100's of applicants for each job role.  also, a letter to a CEO is probably not going to be read, and anything you can write in that letter would have just as much impact in a CV/application anyway.

An attempt to try and give some useful advice:

* use your network of family/friends to find someone who knows someone in this industry.  Who you know still makes a big difference.

* offer to work for free - an internship is likely to have fewer barriers to entry, and may get your foot in the door.

* go back to university and do a Masters in something that could bridge the gap between your physics degree and the financial world (and somewhat supercede your result).

true,hermithome,dalek,Dalek,"Right, time passes normally despite all the stars going out and only the TARDIS heating the earth until 2000 later where it not only starts shrinking but it shrinks so fast that it's suddenly A BIG DEAL. And all of history his been drastically changed except for when Rory and th Doctor need to have common memories. That's not just nitpicking. Drama doesn't really work if you don't know the rules of the universe. This is like that ridiculous scene in ""The Lodger"" where the Doctor is pulled toward the handpad until his hand is just a millimetre from destroying the planet but then, it can be paused while he spits out a shit tonne of exposition. Sure, the music is telling me that this a big deal and I should care about what's happening and that we're heading toward a crescendo but I can't be bothered to care. The music is big and swelling half the time and the show relies on it way to much. So, oh no, the universe is shrinking, time is passing too quickly. That apparently has no bearing on the past or future, it's just here for this moment to heighten the tension. Uggh, that's so annoying.

Moffat is a fan of big concepts that have big impacts but that doesn't work when the concept sometimes applies and sometimes doesn't willy-nilly. That means it has absolutely no impact outside of that one second of drama. And sorry, but I expect more from *Who* than simple heart pounding chase scenes and explosions. I can watch all sorts of crap if I just want that. But I don't, I want more and excepting just the slightest bit of internal consistency or that moments will still matter to me and have impact later, that's not nitpicking, that's the very lowest that I'll accept from a TV show. Honestly, *Who* has been running below my low bar for sometime and I gave it a lot of latitude that I wouldn't have given another show. But it really sucks being a fan of a show that's so disappointing the way *Who* is right now. I want to be excited and to geek out and go over moments and create art and obsess over theory. But in order to do that, I have to turn off my whole fucking brain, and that's not fun. I like scifi and good TV *because* I have a brain, not *in spite* of it. I'm a big *Who* fan and it really, really sucks to no longer be excited. It really sucks to so regularly be disappointed and have to be constantly adjusting (read: lowering m)y expectations. 

It's not nitpicking to expect the same basic level of consistency and development that I expect in anything else. Why are we giving a show we love so much such an enormous free pass? I'm sorry, but I have real problem believing that fans would accept this kind of stuff from another show. I'm happy to turn myself into knots looking for Watsonian answers when a problem is obviously Doyalist. I do it all the damn time. If I'm a fan, I'll apply my considered brains and creativity to solving these sorts of inconsistencies. But when every damn episodes requires that I contort myself into ten positions at once at handwave obvious Doyalist stuff, no, that's just not okay. 

When you love something deeply and call yourself a fan you should hold that work up and demand that it be the very best it can be, not lower your expectations and make excuses and tell other fans who keep those expectations high that they're nitpicking. We're all Whovians, there's no need to beat each other up to make excuses for *Doctor Who*. We're all watching the show and spending to much time and money on fandom. We deserve to have a show that meets our expectations and makes us excited and giddy. Saying that sure, the plot made zero sense and moved entirely at the convenience of the writer, but don't point that out, it's nitpicking is insane. What, I'm supposed to spend my time, energy and money being a fan of something and just be grateful that they all showed up to work? Maybe the plot doesn't make sense but who cares? Nuh-uh.

The reason the 3-5-2 didn't work at first is that Moses was the attacking midfielder but played more like a striker. That left a huge gap between the midfield and the attack, and our creativity suffered. After Moses was dropped, the formation really showed what it was good for.

When Coutinho comes back full time (I don't expect him to start on Saturday), I suspect we'll move to a more fluid 4-2-2-2 with a four man midfield. Arsenal have been attempting this somewhat with their narrow 4-5-1 and overloading the midfield (Flamini, Arteta, Wilshere, Ozil, Ramsey) . Benitez often played with this type of setup (with Kuyt, Gerrard, etc. as wide midfeilders rather than wingers).

People often worry about the lack of width in the 4-2-2-2, but it really offers the same exact width as the 3-5-2 we're running now, and I don't see any problem with it. It does, however, require our two holding midfielders to defend a lot.",0,1383156713,null,0,false,0,cd32cmi,t3_1pjxmf,t1_cd32cmi,t3_1pjxmf,null,1428923806,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

In other words, if you're against press regulation, you're in favour of destroying national security, terrorists and who knows what else.

Let's spin back in time twenty years and consider things that have appeared in the press that a government with a blunt media regulation tool might have been tempted to hush up. 

We can probably ignore isolated incidents involving a single MP - it would be relatively easy to sacrifice the occasional career so as to demonstrate you as a government are doing the right thing - but anything that would seriously embarrass central government would be very likely to come under the magnifying glass.

Throughout the mid-90's, the Tories basically bumped from one scandal to another. To name a few:

 - 1994, a succession of sex scandals put serious pressure on the government of the time.
 - 1994, Cash for Questions - MPs were agreeing to table questions in parliament in exchange for bribes. 
 - 1995, Jonathan Aitken sued the Guardian for libel when they accused him of various dodgy dealings. Not only did he lose, he was subsequently convicted of perjury. 

Of course, the Tories aren't the only party that would want a few things kept quiet:

 - 2003, Blair's dodgy dossier that sent our soldiers to Iraq on a fool's errand hit the press and led to significant political fallout.
 - 2009, the expenses scandal that affected most of Parliament.

The media themselves might be rather interested in bringing some pressure to bear - phone hacking immediately springs to mind.

But when each season has it's own mythology that is inconsistent with other seasons, and each episode within the season has its own mythology that's inconsistent with other episodes, then internal consistency within an ep becomes crucial. Look, in recent years *Who* has had either no character development or negative character development, something I didn't even think was possible. The universe works in a different manner from episode to episode and in S6 the Doctor larks off to go kill off an entire race that hasn't even shown itself to be hostile for no apparent reason. Now I can ignore big stuff like that, though it's not easy. I can create explanations and add stuff in to make this stuff try and make sense. But when there's zero consistency, not within episode, not between episodes, and not between seasons, then no, that doesn't work. And that's not scifi standard, not *Who* standard or any standard. Sure, I expect small detail inconsistency or some big picture inconsistency (generally caused by retcons) but there can't be zero consistency of any kind.

true,bustanuttson,null,null,"""It does, however, require our two holding midfielders to defend a lot.""

So who would you have holding? Obviously Lucas but who else, Gerrard, Allen, or Hendo? What the 3-5-2 allows us to do is play BOTH Gerrard and Henderson forward while not sacrificing a player in the backfield. Three CB's plus Lucas should be enough to defend counterattacks, which are always a risk when deploying wingbacks. Neither Gerrard or Allen are defensive midfielders. I think putting Hendo there is a waste of his industry. He's a terrific presser, links play well, and runs himself into the ground every game. If you think about it, A 4-2-2-2 is essentially almost identical to a 3-5-2. Instead of another defensive midfielder you have a CB. West Brom are a good team with a solid midfield and we bossed the middle of the park for the entire game. I don't think we need another midfielder taking up the space that Suarez/Sturridge utilize at times in order to find the ball. 

I think we have the perfect personnel for a 3-5-2. Four ridiculous CB's whose form and reputation would have them starting on most teams in the PL. Johnson and Enrique on their day are the best wingbacks in the league, and while Johnson has (mostly) figured out how to be consistent, Jose is still working on it. Surrounded by better players this year more than last, I suspect his confidence will grow and he will be dangerous week in and week out. Lucas has been steadily improving the last two months as he recovers from his horrible injuries, and if his fitness reaches the heights it was before, as I suspect it will, he will be an incredible force in midfield for us. He's struggled with pace this year but we've seen an improvement there as well. Either way his reading of the game and tackling is pure class, as is his passing. We saw during West Brom that he's more than able to dominate the area in front of the backs without a partner. And with the two pressing midfielders in front of him, its not like he's isolated. 

And that brings me to Gerrard, Hendo, and Coutinho. In my opinion, the captain is just about to hit top form, as he's shown time and time again that his decent early season performances usually translate into brilliant rest-of-the-season performances. The first game against Man U he was immense. I thought he was just as good against West Brom playing a slightly more advanced position. I can't imagine Brendan dropping him either way, as his presence on the pitch and the incredible will to win he brings to every game cannot be quantified. He is a true professional in every sense of the word and the game of football will suffer a massive loss when he hangs up his boots. 

Countinho vs. Hendo is the only question for me in this lineup, minus which CBs should play. I think the four midfielders we have guaranteed significant games this year are Lucas, Hendo, Gerrard, and Coutinho. Allen is yet to convince but eventually he will force his way into the team in coming years. As we know, Hendo is an effective holding midfielder and if Lucas is ever hurt, suspended or injured (Robbie Fowler forbid), he would make fine CDM, leaving Gerrard and Coutinho in front of him. 

But assuming all four are fit and firing, I think Rodgers will pick Coutinho when we need that creativity to unlock tricky defenses, as he has shown an eye for the killer pass time and time again. When we would benefit from extreme pressing against teams whose midfields can compete/control the middle of the park, Hendo will be the way to go. It's a headache but its a hell of a headache to have. It also goes without saying that SAS would be the strikers.

Anyway /endrant, I can't wait for the fucking Arsenal game. I suspect Messisacker and Koscielny are gonna have nightmares about those two on  Saturday night after they get embarassed.

How do you know that they knew that? Yes, the dickheads attacked some defenseless pets and killed them, but they didn't necessarily know that they were pets to a disabled person as part of rehabilitation.   

I'm not sticking-up for them in anyway, I just feel the need to point that out, because this is a good example of readers of news immediately jumping the gun. You've read the owner is disabled and recovering from a stroke, and you've put 2+2 together and immediately assumed that this makes the attackers worse because they themselves *knew* he is disabled and recovering.   
  

I'm not saying that a bunch of thugs randomly killing pets is a ""lesser"" thing, but for all you know, it could have been just that. It is possible they had no idea that they belonged to someone disabled (not that it makes a difference).

true,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,"There seems to be quite a lot of confusion about what the IWF do and what is causing this issue. Just to add a tiny bit of additional information about what is *actually* happening here:

The IWF hold a list of URLs which should be blocked, and on that list will be a number of specific URLs on the imgur domain which need to be blocked, most likely because they are hosting images which are illegal (child pornography). It is important to realise that it is *only* these specific images and not the entire imgur domain which is on the list.

So the ISPs have a number of ways to deal with this, an example of one of which is for them to respond to DNS requests with the IP address of their own filtering proxy servers. When this happens, you then access the entire imgur domain via their proxy, allowing them to identify which URLs are being accessed and filter content which is on the IWF block-list list on-the-fly.

So when an entire domain such as imgur becomes unavailable, what is actually happening is that there is an issue with the ISP and their proxy servers (or something to do with any one of the methods they may have for implementing the IWF block-list) meaning that they can't forward on requests to the actual imgur servers and therefore can't serve any (blocked or unblocked) material.

The IWF simply compiles a list of URLs which contain child pornography (the merits of this are probably a separate argument to be had, but personally I support what they're doing) and the specific issue affecting access to imgur here really is down to the ISPs.",0,1383160614,null,0,1383161159,0,cd342yv,t3_1phq3r,t1_cd342yv,t3_1phq3r,null,1428922998,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Assuming that I can get you some contact details, I think it would be worth it for you to be quite specific about what type of work experience you want. If you just ask to be placed in the IT department, you may well find yourself changing printer cartridges all day! As you're interested in Systems Analysis, you may want to ask if it's possible to be placed in a Programming or Business Analysis team (or both). This way you're going to get a better feel as to whether you can see yourself doing that type of job when you finish uni.

I don't believe that we employ any dedicated systems analysts. This role is normally performed by a Senior [Analyst Programmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) or an [Architect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect).

Sterling has played the majority of games as a sub, and at times in an unnatural position for him. 

Suso has played almost every game (if not every game) as a starter, and he has been the best player on that team on a regular basis. I have watched almost every Almeria game this season, and despite them being at the bottom of the table, their game is pleasant on the eye, and Suso is responsible for a great part of that (IMO). Almeria is at the bottom because their defense is terribly disorganized, but they still get some goals. 

It is my opinion that Suso will be a much better player than Sterling, Suso has a much better vision, more composure, better protection of the ball, more control of the ball, and better technique (the boy oozes class). Sterling is all speed at the moment, I have not seen a major improvement to his game whether it be vision, finishing, passing, etc...

Sigurdsson should be playing in his natural position over either Eriksen or Holtby, both have shown promise but been too inconsistent for me. 

Who would you like to see getting game time at LW and why? 


Assuming Lamela plays on the right? Townsend should be on the left, all though I like him on the right so he can cut in and shoot with his left but that is also what Lamela is supposed to be good at I guess.


Is Soldado out of form, or playing as expected?


For me Soldado has been pretty fucking awful most matches. He shows flashes of brilliance with certain touches but he has yet to really get involved and influential for a whole match from what I've seen. He just looks puzzled most matches. You can blame it on the service but imo Soldado is just not making certain runs. I can count the amount of times per match that Townsend or somebody is on the outside looking to cross and Soldado just isn't in the box at all for some reason. He has looked positively dreadful IMO but there's time to steady the ship, hopefully.


Out of the new signings, who has impressed you the most (Chiriches, Capoue, Paulinho, Chadli, Soldado and Lamela)?

Capoue looked beastly the matches he played. Most of the players we've signed have looked pretty inconsistent, having a good showing here and there but then disappearing, this can be said about, Paulinho, Soldado, Eriksen, Lamela, and several others IMO

I used to work at a company which did software development. The owner is about 4 years older than me as I recall. Now, me and the owner of the company are similarly educated - both have comp sci degrees from decent universities. I have a 1st, he has a 2:1. Both of us have masters degrees in unrelated fields. 

When he quit uni he worked for a friend for a while, then got work, from another friend, to do IT work for that friend's company. So he started a company, and now has what I'd guess to be a 6 figure turnover. 

I have no friends who own companies, all my friends work for companies or are still in education. (In fact, I landed the job through a mate who still works for this chap!)

What's the difference? I went to a state school. He went to a leading private school. I did better academically, but in the end who owns a company? Him. Why? Because he has mates who own companies, some of which they took over from their parents. How did he get those mates? School.

Now if *I* started a company, there is no way contracts would drop into my lap like that. I'd have to go out and work my arse off to get even a part of the success he enjoys, that he got just through virtue of his upbringing and his social circles.

I very much doubt I'm alone in this experience. Meritocracy, IMHO, is for the most part a lie told to us by the very wealthy to justify their existence.

true,grollcool,null,null,"He had a great first half, but then simmered down in the second. This is probably just due to his lack of playing time. He had an amazing pre-season and then a brilliant performance in the first game of the season. Then his next game was against Man United where basically everyone was told not to try to attack or keep the ball for reasons still unknown. That is when his form went down the hill because he didn't start until many games later in the Swindon Town cup tie where he had a average performance. Then like I said, in his latest performance he had a overall good game, but people only like to remember only the last minutes before he was subbed off where he wasn't doing his best. But the entire first half he was amazing, connecting with Willian and Mata very well. If players dont get a good run of games they cant have solid performances. Do you remember Mata at the beginning of the season? His first few performances were not that great but after a few games he started to shine like his old self.

Also, I have been watching De Bruyne for quite sometime and he would have been a perfect fit for last seasons Chelsea were we played that attack minded free flowing football where the top 3 interchanged. Rotating him with Mata/Oscar/Hazard would have been perfect because he can play all 3 of the positions and is best when **ON** the ball and not off it. This counter attacking, defensive heavy mentality is hurting some of our star players and personally I would implement a possession game especially with the personnel available. Oscar is really the only one of our main players that is best suited for this style of play (besides Jose's purchases of Willian and Schurrle) and even he is arguably just as good in possession style as well. I would try to stick with possesion play as much as possible then maybe once you score a goal or 2 then revert to the counter attack play. Mourinho's Madrid were perfect for counter attack style in the last 3 seasons because of the players they had, Ronaldo, Benzema and Di Maria. Ronaldo and Di Maria is the best winger pairing in the world on the break, so its easy to see why it was successful for them. But Hazard is not a Ronaldo style player, if anything he is much much more closer to a Ribery type winger who is best with the ball at his feet with his team in possession and has the ability to both create and score goals. I believe that teams should play a style that best suit their personnel and from the players we have at our disposal we are best suited with high a pressure/possession game.

Monreal is a great backup left back, Vermaelen is a great choice for a backup too. Sagna can slot in at centre back and Jenkinson was actually pretty solid last season, even against Bayern. People were calling for him to start ahead of Sagna. 

He's just going through a rough patch like Joe Hart.

&gt;Quite frankly you dont even have a solid back four.

One of the best defenses statistically of 2013 says otherwise.

&gt;Yes you have lots of players that are the same up front and in the middle, that's hardly depth

Choice of wingers: Chamberlain, Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski, Gnabry.

&gt;Walcott has been above average at best.

For England and on the ball yes, but his movement is so important. We've really been missing a winger as all 4 senior's were injured at the same time. Almost all of our wingers were injured yet we still won many of our matches with Wilshere and Ramsey/Gnabry on the wing.

&gt;Lets be honest, if not for Ozil and Giroud miraculously being in form, you lot would be out of the title running full stop

Ozil has not been in form, he's been poor for 3 matches now. Even against Norwich he was missing for pretty much all of the game but he still managed to score twice. He was poor against Swansea and West Brom too.

Our ability to score the first goal in all of our league games so far and our midfield has kept us in the title race. Not just Ozil and Giroud. Giroud for example was very wasteful against Palace &amp; Swansea and poor against West Brom but we still managed to win 2 and draw one. Miraculously is an incredible exaggeration.

For 4 games in the season we had a good 7 first team players injured. We still won all of them comfortably. I think our depth is the reason we won those games.

The only position in the whole squad where we do not have 2 good players for a place is centre back (where Sagna can play well). Try and tell me otherwise.",0,1383164692,null,0,false,0,cd35vne,t3_1phrp4,t1_cd35vne,t1_cd354i2,null,1428922092,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1

That's just standard low level corruption and criminal activity you see throughout the third world, especially ones where foreign aid and investment is coming in.  That I see as perfectly believable. 

I do not see how that points to a wider conspiracy where NATO is enacting an institutionalised plan to keep the war going for drugs, arms and mineral deals.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt; In fact, there's no known system on the planet that can do that.

The only reason I can't scream ""Bullshit"" from every mountain is because of you saying ""reliably"". Any system  Anti missile systems such such as AEGIS are capable of taking down cruise missiles (they're much easier targets than high velocity anti-ship  missiles which these systems were designed to defend from).

&gt;Ergo, a $3 million missile (the new planned low-observable replacement for the Tomahawk) that if shot down is the end of the story is a better investment than a $200 million plane that if shot down creates a whole clusterfuck of problems like how the hell you get the pilot out and what the fuck happens if the enemy manages to nick some of the technology? 

That's some nice armchair generalship there. As for using them as a substitute for aircraft - if we're not doing it now then we won
t be doing it any time soon. Tomahawks can't get eyes on a target, they can't loiter, they require a fairly complicated and often vulnerable launch system, and above all, they're much, much more expensive than a bomb.

People think that just because we're not currently at war with any other major nation that we never will be ever again, that peace is assured for all time and that's the end of that. It's a very short sighted position, and it's a very dangerous position to take too.

&gt;It doesn't mean he was a tree hugger.

Define ""Tree Hugger"". If you mean environmentalist, I don't think you can say whether he would have been one or not. If you mean ""pacifist"", then you would be right: George Orwell was not a pacifist. But you seem to be implying that socialism implies pacifism... which is not the case. Most socialists, especially those of Orwell's day, are far from pacifists.

The Guardian is predominantly a liberal publication, so yes I imagine he wouldn't care for it or its readers, as Orwell was a socialist.

Yet we have two good players for every position except for centre back. . . .

Have you been watching the games? Ramsey's been much better than him. We were winning before Ozil signed, and we've won almost every game since not because of him. He's had 3 good involved games, the rest he's been pretty invisible. Have you watched the games?

You're going along with the one man team hype if you think we are one. We've only depended on Ozil for the Napoli match I'd say. And that was only for the first 15 mins.

I don't use pectin at all unless I'm using a fruit without natural setting capability, such as peach. The only things I add are spices, such as ginger and splashes of lemon juice. 

My ratios are generally 1:1, 1 lb or sugar for every 1lb of fruit  (so 50%)

This works for apple, strawberry, apricot, blackberry, plum and raspberry. 

I only use more than 50% for Blackcurrant and gooseberry, for those I use 60%, these would work with less sugar but more of the bitterness from the fruit would come through and I personally like my Jams sweet. 

You can adjust the texture by increasing cooking times so the 'runny' argument doesn't stand. 

For cherry, peach and rhubarb I use less than 50%. Rhubarb does have a bitterness to it but because I generally serve it with something sweet like cream and scones, rather than using it on plain toast I don't mind this.

He did suggest that depending on your motivations for coming to the UK specifically, and the amount of time you're prepared to invest in getting here, two options could be looking for freelance work that you could potentially do from your current location until you build a brand reputation for yourself, or getting employment in the US for a company with a global presence, with a view to working for them in a UK location at a future date.

However i have been advised to add the disclaimer that although my friend has worked in recruitment for quite a lot longer than he ever planned to, he has never been involved in getting an American a job in Britain, so doesn't have experience of your situation.

If you want to make money, you have to be *the best at sales*, not the best according to some other ""more fair"" metric. Also, investing money, making partnership deals, and hiring people are very risky with huge potential losses, and after looking at the details/numbers mostly happen based on the ""gut feeling"" about trusting the other party.

But ""knowing the right people"" doesn't happen by accident for most entrepreneurs. They go to networking events at least once a week, promote their ideas and themselves, and *build* the contacts over years. Honestly, going to a public school might give you 5 useful contacts 5 years later? You need 500, and you need to spend at least 5 hours per week specifically working on that. It is *extremely* tedious but important.

But it's not that hard to get started. Pick an idea for a side project. Go to startup events, hackathons, and other meetups. Any that are worthwhile are free or priced at the cost of the free snacks. Let people tell you about their work, and then tell people how awesome your idea is (even if you are never going to actually start the company), and ask them to introduce you to anyone else who could be helpful. Set yourself a target to talk to at least 5 other people every night, and follow them up afterwards by email, asking them more about *their* work or business (even if you really don't care). In less than a year, you should have a massive network of people who know you personally, and who you can get in touch with again once you *do* start the company.

true,CptES,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The only reason I can't scream ""Bullshit"" from every mountain is because of you saying ""reliably"". Any system Anti missile systems such such as AEGIS are capable of taking down cruise missiles (they're much easier targets than high velocity anti-ship missiles which these systems were designed to defend from).

The only thing AEGIS is confirmed to have been able to shoot down is an Iranian airliner. Even the most combat-proven anti-missile system (Isreal's Iron Dome) has a success rate between 5% and 95% based on who you ask.

&gt;As for using them as a substitute for aircraft - if we're not doing it now then we won't be doing it any time soon. Tomahawks can't get eyes on a target, they can't loiter

Which is why NATO is pushing UAV technology so hard right now. While much of it is still classified we know they can loiter, are hard to spot and can provide accurate intelligence and munition guidance. The US has even started to use it as an attack platform in its own right (which, politics aside appears to be an effective system).

&gt; Peace exists because we are powerful - when we lose that power we give others opportunities which we do not want them to have.

It's power we've already lost. We're faced with the odd idea of having carrier aircraft for five years with no aircraft carrier to launch them from. 

Look, I agree that the UK should have some form of conventional Big Stick, if only because we spent the last 250 years screwing everyone that would hold still long enough but can you tell me with a straight face that an aircraft that five years into flight testing gets damaged by **its own afterburner** is a good investment?",0,1383170033,null,0,false,0,cd389g9,t3_1ph1zf,t1_cd389g9,t1_cd36ro0,null,1428920976,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17286328

&gt; Real freedom of information is about ""the money that goes in, the results that come out"", as opposed to ""FOI requests that are all about processes"".

&gt; That's the view of [the PM], which he expressed yesterday at the end of his evidence session in front of a House of Commons committee.

&gt; He distinguished between the increased transparency that derives from the publication of data (such as crime maps, local government spending and public sector contracts), which he is enthusiastic about, and what he called ""the endless discovery process"" of responding to FOI requests, which clearly doesn't appeal to him quite so much. 

&gt; It's not the first indication that [the PM] is becoming ""the heir to Blair"" in his attitude to freedom of information. We've already had reports of remarks in which he's said that due to FOI, ""officials and ministers are increasingly reluctant to put on paper what they actually think"".

&gt; [The PM's] stance can be seen as an illustration of what one international academic authority on FOI, Professor Al Roberts, has called ""executive pushback"" - attempts by political leaders to counter or undermine FOI laws.

*[Aside] You are encouraged to read for better context of the situation from Q429.*

Q438 [PM]
&gt; [...] I have to say that in my experience of two years, and the Freedom of Information Act and all the rest of it, it seems to me that real freedom of information is the money that goes in and the results that come out. Making government more transparent is the best thing. We spend an age-fortunately not me, but the system seems to-on dealing with FOI requests that are all about processes, but what the public, the country and Parliament need to know is how much money are you spending, is it being spent well and what are the results. I think we have approached, as a country, the wrong end of the telescope. What we are doing now includes the publication of the contracts; the publication of the outcomes; the publication of the information. You can go on a crime map; you can see where the crimes are being committed; you know how much the police are spending; you know where they are spending it; and you can break down local government spending to the last £500. That is freedom of information, but this endless discovery process that furs up the whole of Government-don’t worry, we are not making any proposals to change it.

Q439 [PM]
&gt; [...], but I would rather we went down the track of saying, ""What are the data we need published?"" rather than changing the Freedom of Information Act. I will go away and consider that point, but I think that publication of information is better than the discovery process, which I think furs up the arteries on occasions.

Q440 [Chair of Inquiry]
&gt; If you are not going down the road of your predecessor Tony Blair, you may be making an offer to come to the Justice Committee and explain your views on freedom of information.

There are rules, sure, but they don't last more than five seconds, nd then they're ignored, forgotten about, revived when convenient and dumped again. And that just pushed me too far. 

Series 6 &amp; 7 really pushed me, there's no internal consistency whatsoever and the large plotholes get bigger and bigger. Honestly, I just want a bone. That's all, throw me a bone Moffat. Have character development, or a big bad that works the same way each appearence or tighter scifi or something! Something! 

Honestly, a lot of this is just my disappointment. I love concept driven scifi. I can be thinking about a *Twilight Zone* episode days, weeks, months, YEARS later, and still turning it over in my mind. And Moffat's capable of this stuff. He starts these big concepts and then abandons them, half built. We never get to see the consequences, or any of the good stuff.

I work as a developer. Any size company, no matter what they do, will have problems that can be made easier with a custom solution, rather than just using access.

Let's say the smallest business, a custom made onesie shop has trouble keeping track of orders. Here are some jobs that would make their life so much easier.

* Customers place orders, an email has to processed by a person. A web form, can be processed automatically.
* Costs have to be calculated and a back and forth conversation has to happen, the same webform could calculate the total cost taking into account options.
* Stock has to be managed. Certain fabrics might have a longer lead time than others. Whenever stock runs out, a telephone conversation has to be made. An automatic PO system could be put into place, and it could estimate when zero stock levels will be reached with current usage rates. **AUTOMATION**
* When they come to sew together the onesie, how do they know the specifications? Maybe a summary screen showing all the pertinent information might be needed. Everyone knows exactly what they need to know.
* How is the label printed off and posted? Does it take 10 steps, or is it a label printer that prints off a label with one click? **STREAMLINGING**
* How do you monitor worker's performance? If you make as much of the process controlled as possible, you can measure EVERYTHING. Fleece onesies for instance, may take longer to sew than jersey onesies, yet this wasn't estimated into the costing. **CONTROL**

true,Galerath,null,null,"Aye but that's not quite the point.

Let me put it this way. Imagine that in life we have 3 options, the Easy, Medium and Hard routes in life, corresponding to how much effort you put in.

I came from an upper middle class background, my former boss came from a wealthy background. We both have the Easy/Medium/Hard options, but they differ. For him, the easy route was to work for some mates, the Medium route was to take the opportunities that fell into his lap and start a decent company, and the Hard route was to expand that company beyond the 'free' contracts and make something properly impressive. 

He took the Medium route and did very well for himself.

Now, I had 3 options too. For me the Easy Route would have been to doddle through uni, and get some half arsed job. The Medium route was to work hard at uni, get a good degree and impressive CV and find something decent, and the Hard route was to start a company and try and piece together something resembling a decent company.

Now, I took the Medium route and ended up working for him. My ""hard"" route is his Medium route. My Medium route is his Easy route. His hard route is essentially unobtainable to me (without essentially working so hard that one wonders what the point would be). Neither of us are likely to fall as far as living on the street.

I agree that I *could* work extremely hard and get to where he is, but the point is, *I'd have to work extremely hard*, when *he didn't*. In a meritocracy, or in a reality where the private/state divide wasn't so huge, if we both put in the same amount of effort, we'd both end up in roughly the same place. In the world we inhabit the contacts which you make by simply being born to the right people and sent to school in the right place, are a really considerable advantage, which means that people who posses it can achieve much more with the same amount of effort.

And the further down the scale you go, the harder it gets. I.e. I could start a company tomorrow, because I have Capital and Education, landing the first contracts would be a difficult thing, and would take a great deal of effort, but I could do it. But if I'd come from a council estate in Liverpool, I perhaps would have neither, so even taking that first step would be an almost insurmountable obstacle. But that's the wider problem of capitalism - it's supposed to work like a game of Monopoly, except in a game of Monopoly, all sides start with the same hand...

In his final moments he had a form of redemption since he found out that the High Council was ultimately responsible for his madness by implanting the drumming that haunted him all his lives hence why right at the end he helps the Doctor in driving them back into the Time War even throwing himself in with them. If he were to return it could be a completely different man from the Master we've come to know. Or conversely going into the Time War and coming out again could have driven him into an even deeper realm of insanity and he comes out worse than ever.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"Other people have covered formation, so I'll touch on strategy. I think we need to play the counter attacking game pretty much the whole match unless we go behind. 

I don't think we will be able to dominate possession at emirates, especially without coutinho (who probably won't be started, but on the bench) so I think we'd just tire ourselves out putting on a huge battle for +50 possession. Arsenal have the quality to pass the ball and have looked pretty threatening in quick transition themselves. 

That's not to say we should show up with the bus parked and tires slashed, but sit defence and midfield generally deeper, and let them pass the ball around the midline/their own half. Once they start intruding on say the deeper 2/3s of our half, then press hard to disrupt their passing game and create opportunities to hit on the break. 

I think we have great players for this, Sturridge is fast as fuck, Suarez loves running at defenders with space, Henderson is a machine like box to box player who can get up quick in attack and get back just as fast to defend if we lose the ball, and I think we all know what Stevie can do with long range diagonals to launch a counter attack. 

Arsenal's defence is solid, but look like they (ESP. Mertesaker if he plays) can be vulnerable to speed on the break. 

With this sort of setup I can see us nullifying arsenals strength (quick passes, though balls, vertical play, etc) and targeting their weakness with our strength (quick counter attacks led by two of the most on form strikers in Europe at the moment) plus you know how Johnson and Enrique like to fly forwards if they get a chance.

But yeah, the little stuff doesn't bother me as much.

Chamberlain only? Chamberlain wouldn't be first choice if Ozil wasn't here. He is a luxury over Cazorla who would play behind the striker if he we didn't sign Ozil's services. Ozil is in no way a necessity mate, take him out of the team and we will be worse yes but we will still cope.

Without Ozil, that is still a good midfield with creativity. He is not a necessity, he is a luxury.

In this formation it would be easy for the CMS to shift to the sides and have the CAM or the forward to drop deeper and cover the nearest CM. If you think about it, this formation actually overloads the opponents half. It allows us to apply high pressure. [defensive roles](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=1m0f)

If a splitting pass is made that escapes that pressure, the fullback is there to mop it up, then the whole team would naturally shift into a more defensive shape if possession was not won. Its not like we would be defending in this formation. All it takes is organization. IMO, with good organization and team understanding it could be really good for a pressing/possession based game. 



So for 3 different circumstances:

1. [Off the ball, pressing high](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=1m0f)

2. [Off the ball, under heavy pressure](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=1m0h) (the outlet can switch or come back and join the defense)

3. [transitioning back to attack/formation 1](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=1m0v) (this would change all the time depending on which side the ball was won on. In this case, its assuming the ball was won on the right side and play is being moved up the right side of the field.

true,corris85,null,null,"Your are correct the face value is much less. But it's still insane. Boston has the highest avg face value tickets in baseball and remember they play  81 games a year unlike 8 home games like  american football.. Also i have never been to a Champs league final game but I doubt tickets avg near 2k usd for half decent seats,

Also The Sox get a cut from these tickets agency's. It's basically legalized scalping and super unfair for supporters. I dunno the exact amount but id guess FSG is raking in 100+USD min per ticket from these scalping sites... possibly up to 50% I have heard....

Anyways This WS win likely knocks up FSG to perhaps the most valuable non-petro dollar ownership team in the world.

Even before this and the Bruins nearly wining the cup. Forbes ranked the Sox worth about 1.6b, NESN ( The Sox the Burins cable channel FSG owns) 500m+, and LFC 700m+. My friend works in baseball ops for a diff team and estimates a WS win is worth 250-400m USD over the next 2-3 3 years....

I just hope they invest some of this windfall in LFC. it makes tons of sense to me as Boston's Payroll simply cannot go much higher in such a small market like New England. Also I just don't see where it could be spent on. The Infrastructure and team is just so loaded.

If FSG splurged on LFC however. Well they could get a massive return I feel by adding a cpl world class players.. and spending freely on young talent. we could be in Arse/Man united money in a year or two.

TL:DR FSG just got a huge windfall I hope they spend it on LFC!

I was also loving the Abby development. I'm glad we're getting somewhere with her mystery. Alex and Finn are starting to build a quite enjoyable love hate relationship, I'm really digging it. And I continue to love Jess. She's been a team player since the get go and this episode really emphasized that aspect of her personality once again.

The Jess/Rudy shipping hint definitely took me by surprise. I don't know how I'd feel about them getting together but it actually might make sense with the way the show has developed the characters, the strongest foundation coming from the Evil Rudy episode.

And the flying kid is very intriguing. I'm assuming he will become the villain at some point, that's the vibe I'm getting. Also, that really looks like him on Rudy 2's sweater AND he has an A-list power.

One minor development I'm really anxious about, the GTA guy actually coming back into the spotlight. It appears he'll come back into the fold but to what extent? No one in the current gang can identify him, but maybe he'll drop the info that he killed Simon to Rudy.

Simply put, a year ago FSG was on shaky financial footing with the cash cow. known as Red Sox and NESN Looking in rather bad shape.

As of right now, the RS are unlikely to splurge a ton of cash on players or anything. and one thing I know about our owners... He knows that to make money one must Spend.

When he bought the team for 700m or so back in 20003 he could have cut payroll and conceded the division tot the Yanks. instead hes kept on putting money into the Sox team stadium and rept the rewards. 

Indeed I expect him to invest much of this windfall into LFC. Why? because the Sox have a huge Payroll as is and can afford it. The Red Sox are  a cash cow for FSG at this point, and indeed shall continue to be. AS it stands they have perhaps the best roster and young players going forward of any baseball team. I just can't see how they can really keep investing big amounts into the RS and expect big returns.

however invest into Anfield/LFC is simply smart. I mean simply investing 30-60m$ in January could pay for itself if it increases attendance and causes us to make the champs league.

Additionally, I have reconsidered my choice of degree, and plan on doing one that I'm not quite as interested in but that offers external accreditation and has an exceptionally high employment rate. It also offers a year of paid work, which would be a huge help.

I would start with that, because you may find they backtrack - or that it isn't true. 

If you start a legal process based on a claim that either the isp deny, or it turns out that the guy on the helpdesk was just spinning a line to get you off the phone you may lose.

The fact is that it is likely that there is something suspicious about this vague 'its the exchange' claim. The connection from you to the rest of the world is in different stages and the ISP can do some things about this. 

If the bottle neck is the ISPs terminating equipment then it's the ISP that should stump up to reduce the contention and their bandwidth. Your contract may or may not mention this contention level.

If the bottleneck is the exchange itself then the ISP can demand a certain level of service or get their money back. If the ISP is aware there is congestion in the the exchange and not raised this / demanded the refund (there is a very strict level of service to stop the exchange guys playing favourites and the ISPs usually scream if they suspect this).

If the bottleneck is from the exchange to the rest of the world, again the ISP should be screaming over the payments they are making, and unless you are on an island or something and there is an agreed limit the upgrade should be made.

Another major positive for me was the house price bubble bursting, I grew up in an era when if you had a house you'd be earning 10-20k a year in its value just for being a homeowner. If you weren't it was depressing. At least the brakes have been put on that (apart from london). 

Downside is inflation, food, heating etc have gone up hugely. Linked to that it the collapse of the £, I have family in the €urezone, my £ used to by €1.6 then it want to almost 1=1 which meant visiting was 60% more expensive!

Also in an effort to keep the housing bubble afloat / save the banks, the interest rates were dropped to levels so low which meant that my savings haven't earned interest and because of the QE and inflation this meant my savings are now worth less (in real terms) than before.

true,cbfw86,uk,South West London,"Just hit the family. My uncle has been a social worker for over 30 years. Never married, never saved, spent his money on others - he is too generous; bought everyone who went to university from his local parish a £500 laptop.

Now he's older and the government cuts are hitting that sector he is the lowest hanging fruit. He is now unemployed and sadly unemployable. He has developed Type 2 diabetes (that's probably the result of bachelor living in fairness), the family has a history of coeliac disease developing later in life, he is practically blind due to glaucoma, but the problem is that now that he's lost his job at 60 he's looking at very little to hold onto. The nieces and nephews he used to dote on growing up have all got families and kids and live further away. I'm in London and just can't get up to see his as often as I'd like. I have my own life and errands which occupy my weekends, etc..

I'm scared that he will simply give up. My mother met a mutual friend the other day and that's how we learnt how bad the situation is. She called him and had a chat. He said, ""I'd like to see cbfw86 as soon as possible. He gets everything"" (we were always very close when I was a boy). I'm going up to Birmingham with my parents to see him this weekend. If he starts giving me his precious things I might lose it.

The last time I saw him about a year ago all he did was talk about the kids he is helping at work. Now that he's been booted before pension age I'm scared that it'll just crush his dignity and he'll let go.

The government is not entirely responsible for everything that he is burdened with right now, but taking away his purpose and giving him a meagre stipend may have set in motion a chain of events which will result in an earlier death than it needs to be.",0,1383210714,null,0,false,0,cd3lm12,t3_1plhfm,t1_cd3lm12,t3_1plhfm,null,1428914613,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,[deleted],null,null,"An alternative anecdote: I was privately educated at a boarding school at my parents' wishes. I soon resented it but I didn't have a choice until I was 16, at which point I jumped at the chance to switch to a state 6th form college.

I had the opportunity to keep contacts from extremely wealthy backgrounds, but I refused because most of the kids who had these contacts were just not my kind of people. I worked bloody hard to get where I am today (just got a new job at a PR firm and very happy). I've worked retail, delivered pizzas, I worked in a bread factory in Cornwall with people who couldn't read while I studied my degree, I worked in a wine shop for 10 hours a day full time while studying for more exams. It's a lot more complicated than ""rich kids get it easy, poor kids get it hard"". Life is a myriad of experiences and surprises, and while I think your anecdote is absolutely valid, I don't think it's fair to generalise.

Today, quite a lot of the rich snobby kids I knew from school are gallivanting around, having the time of their lives *at the moment*. I met a few last year at a friends 21st, you'd be surprised how many of them are successful but utterly miserable, one in particular stood out; his dad was forcing him into running the family farm. He was terrified and totally unprepared for it, having been taught very well how to pass an exam and nothing else. Many of these kids will do nothing of value, they resent their parents and their parents resent them; handing money out to them as a sort of ""cure all"" for the sociopathic tendencies they've passed down to them. Quite a few are drug addicts/alcoholics now (drugs are cheap and plentiful for these kids) and it seems that private school did nothing but damage these kids, forcing them to rebel by being overly authoritative and domineering to the point of breaking. Many others are successful but depressed, or just downright awful people. Yes, there are also quite a lot who are successful, happy, and lovely people; but I put that down to the parents frankly.

To generalise, a lot of the kids from my school who worked hard, studied, volunteered, and didn't go to India for a year to grow dreads and ""find themselves"" are doing very well; many of the kids who had an easy ride are now completely fucked as a result. Yes I'm sure you're playing the world's tiniest violin for them, but they are people. They were born into circumstances they cannot control.

The fact is life isn't fair, but it's not simple either. We need to improve all education private or not, and bashing one side or another does nothing to help.

As a side note, I think we should focus heavily on the class sizes of state school. I was amazed to learn that classes can reach up to 30+ students. At my school, we considered a big class to be just under 20 students. This why private schools get better results in exams.

Also, feel free to AMA about private boarding school.",0,1383211096,null,0,false,0,cd3lnpf,t3_1pju54,t1_cd3lnpf,t1_cd3acan,null,1428914591,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"It hasn't affected me directly, but I have a couple of mates who are fighting for their flats - and lives really - because of the clampdown on invalidity benefit ( or whatever they're calling it nowadays ) 

One was stabbed in the back multiple times during an altercation in a back alley after coming out of a nightclub in Brixton in 1998. Brilliant guy, electronics engineer who had a promising career and basically lost it all after the stabbing. They never caught the guy who did it and it wasn't on CCTV. They say he's fit for work and have stopped his benefits after an assessment even though he suffers depression, hideous back pain ( I've been around to his place when his been laid on the couch crying on several occasions ) and he can't really walk on a good day. 

The other pretty much the same thing although he has gout in his knees, ankles and hands. Again benefits frozen after an assessment deemed him fit for work. 

Both are fighting on appeal against the judgements, but it's not looking good for either really.  

The Tories don't give a shit, they just want the figures down regardless of the personal cost.

Direct democracy is not the same thing as majority voting, before anyone gets their knickers in a twist over it.

The difference is that taking part in direct democracy would actually have significant impact in our lives.

Brand is calling for a revolution.  In telling him to go read Orwell, Webb is saying that revolution will achieve very little in the long run.  The old dictator would be overthrown only to be replaced with a new one in the fullness of time. He thinks a better approach is to embrace the democratic system and try to fix it from the inside. 

The irony is that Webb doesn't seem to realise that the Labour party that historically stood for socialist ideals is a thing of the past.  It has long since been infiltrated by Thatcherites (Blair and co) and subverted to a different cause.  New Labour is New Tory.  Webb says we should trust the Labour party because they have our best interests at heart.

Disclaimer: I'm not really a Chelsea fan, but i do watch (almost) all of your games because you're fun to watch (especially the free flowing football last year) and i like seeing the Belgians play. Hazard, KDB, Lukaku &amp; Courtois are some of my favorite players to watch, so i kind of became a Chelsea fan by association.


&gt;Also, I have been watching De Bruyne for quite sometime and he would have been a perfect fit for last seasons Chelsea were we played that attack minded free flowing football where the top 3 interchanged.


I agree with this so much! For the first time ever, i even bet €50 on Chelsea to win the PL because i was convinced that Hazard+Mata+KDB+Oscar with a solid striker in front (i was thinking they'd get rooney with lukaku as backup, but oh well...) would be unstoppable.


KDB has a sort of goal-oriented directness that i think even improves Hazard's games. Although obviously Mata &amp; Oscar are great combined with Hazard too. But i'd think KDB's crosses could be a major benifit for Chelsea.

For example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cafdOBJe7c
Courtois kept us in this game, KDB gave us the victory. I'm sure that without KDB, Belgium wouldn't have been qualified yet.


All that being said, in the current system (with Hazard, Oscar &amp; Schurrle usually starting) i don't see how KDB could manage to get ahead of Mata AND William.

I've also been shooting a lot recently with a bunch of ex-reality peeps (mostly talent from BGT and crew from Strictly) so have a fairly good handle on it. 

The compere's lines are scripted and the ""story"" elements of the show are written. Also, each comedian will work with the production team and their writing team in advance to have the best material for the show. In terms of Buzzcocks, this means the team captains and comedy guests will all have their spot that they'd do. However, what I think I meant to say in the word salad above was when it \*IS\* unplanned it works the best and there are those of us that work in improv that know how to put in a great show. 

Although I don't know for sure - I'm willing to wager that Paul Merton prepares nothing or very little as he is an improv stalwart.

Secondly, many of the 53m people in England themselves are not of English descent. We have a huge immigrant population and a huge number of people descended form immigrants. I for one have more Irish and Scottish ancestry than I do English. 

Those figures on ancestry are wrong. Firstly the countries with 'diaspora' populations are mostly people with ancestry from several countries, they're only of partial Irish/English descent. Secondly Irish ancestry is over-reported in America (due to yanks' romantic view of Ireland), the most significant diaspora country, while English ancestry is massively under-reported. For instance anyone with any roots in the south (including pretty much all African-Americans) will have lots of English ancestry, but they mostly just identify as 'American' on ancestry surveys as their ancestors went to America so long ago they don't even know when anymore.

Seems to be split between those who didn't go to the game being satisfied with the point, and those who made the trek, perhaps understandably, feeling a bit of frustration:

*Here's a wordsmith from WATRB*:

&gt; ""Well happy with a point at wigan.""

&gt;If you had been here you wouldn't be.Poor bryond belief.

*LFW traveler...*

&gt;just back....jenas is very poor , phillips near to it 
why qpr fans chanted for johnson kills me, he came on, got thru ..the goalie comes out, taps aj and the tool doesn't go down, i recall many dives for palace....but not for qpr? we pass side to side like crabs, endless..massing up possession with no end product

*And this one...*
&gt;thought we were well organised and keep the ball well. We still, however, seem to lack penetration and Austin remains too isolated. I did think Wigan were very beatable but they have a decent home record so a point is not to be sniffed at. 

*Another...*
&gt; Hoilett couldn't pass water tonight. I counted eleven times when we were attacking and he gave the ball away putting us on the backfoot.

*Last one:*
&gt;We would have been a lot better if Hoilett would pass occasionally although he was our standout attacking player. Austin looked a bit ineffective, although he was being marked very closely. AJ did a lot more than him when he came on.

*And this tweet from Dr. LFW himself:*

&gt;[I know we're all terribly trendy and modern and new age but there is no shame in a) having a shot and b) delivering a set piece.](https://twitter.com/LoftforWords/status/395671755391762432)

I remember how I thought Hoilett was gonna be the bee's knees earlier in the season.  I no longer believe that to be the case. Does he not have the confidence to weight a decent pass when he's moved the ball into the danger area? In theory having a player the standard of BAE should compensate to some degree, but that doesn't seem to be clicking yet. Christ, maybe it's time to give Traoré a run out.

Throwing on AJ sounded like it energised things slightly. Maybe the squad we have suits his playing style more than Austin?

Thankfully Kranjcar's injury can be covered, but with what level of creative quality is the question.

Still...3rd place this far into the season is pretty nice. It's just frustrating that we can't capitalise on that position buy scoring goals. 14 in 13 games isn't really what I'd expect from the millions the Club is dishing out. The next two games should also be tough. How well McClaren knows us could be tricky.

What's frustrating is that, as opposed to merely avoiding doing a Wolves, they've obviously spent the money to chase promotion, and it would be nice to feel comfortable with the table position which still has us in the frame. We had enough players to almost field a team that in theory wouldn't have been plagued by the problems of last year, that they could have grown organically. I don't mean the dross that we shippd out. I'm talking Hill and Onuoha. Harriman and YSY. Barton, Faurlin, Diakité and Phantom man. Traoré, Hoilett and SWP. AJ and...well, prob would've need another striker.

I need some confirmation of this from other UK people, as I have no solid proof.

When I was a young child, I was visiting my countryfolk, upper-middle-class-ish grandparents.

My grandfather asked me if I had been see to ""The Hounds' Mate"". Not being countryfolk myself, I was desperately hoping he was being very out-of-character and using slang (mate=friend), to suggest I meet some dog's new friend.

After some awkward conversation, it turned out there was some countryside ritual that involved everyone gathering to watch dogs fuck.

I think it's a fox-hunting/village life thing, where people meet up to find mates for their hunting dogs. Obviously, you need quite a lot of people to provide adequate selection, so they make a bit of an event of it. Can anybody else confirm? I doubt it was a joke (not his kind of thing)...


Slightly related note... I have friends in India who own a gentleman Alsatian. They discovered other people in their town who owned a lady alsation.

I seriously believe it's divided the 20's generation into people either recklessly having children who are dependant on benefits and the other side that no longer believe houses or children are something that will ever be affordable. 

And for the perpetual renters who are mid 30's and still have a cleaning rota in their shared houses is almost laughable. 

I think - if I'm honest - it'll lead to our society becoming very bizarre. 

Why do I think this? Well the stark contrast between my childhood friends who're now all on benefits and the middle class friends I now have is fairly pronounced. 

The guys on benefits are all getting married at 23 and have already had kids and the middle class friends are hosting swing nights with a few lads in their mid 20s getting the snip because having children seems like a financial nightmare for them.

Honestly I reckon our society is going to get very strange in the next decade when people are emptying their wages on rent and traditional gender roles completely vanish and I imagine it will be something very akin to what Japan is currently seeing - people uninterested in the opposite sex because they don't have much disposable wages and due to less disposable income have less space (studio apartments) and therefore less interested in spending their spare time and money on a relationship and all it entails",0,1383219208,null,0,1383223463,0,cd3mqbo,t3_1plhfm,t1_cd3mqbo,t3_1plhfm,null,1428914091,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I wouldn't say the cost is 'minimal', it requires a legal process to be followed and needs an injunction to be made in the high court, the legal fees for which are the responsibility of the rights holder.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"Well as others have pointed out austerity didn't really mean cutting everything, it just meant not investing in anything.

Things I've noticed:

* everyone I know on JSA or incapacity has had a hard time of being sanctioned and/or reassessed. Every. Single. One. My girlfriend was sanctioned for getting a job and not going to dole office (because, you know, she was at her new job!).

* Roads in Gloucestershire haven't been resurfaced or protected from frost, and as such there's been an issue with potholes. Pothole repair is done on a contracted basis to the cheapest bidder. It's one of those things again where small cuts here and there don't make a 'big' immediate difference, but the effect is there.

* Industry wise, my career is in retail analysis and our company is still posting impressing lfl growth, but this is not because the market has grown but because we have stole our competitors market share. Several of our competitors have gone into administration. This means we've got a lot of smart people - including IT developers, graphic designers, copy writers etc. for fairly cheaps. Even my boss! In an industry that is fully dependant on consumer spending, lack of government confidence in the economy has the knock on effect that people don't spend. 

* The next stage of my career will be taking a team under me, and it's already been discussed and planned - but that won't happen until the company hits a certain size. 'Austerity' (or rather, lack of confidence in government and consumers) is probably *partially* responsible for me being 1 - possibly 2 years behind on where my career would otherwise be. I'm having to do more work for (proportionally) less results because the market conditions are unfavourable. We are also dependent on £GBP - $USD exchange rate so the lack of recovery has increased our COGS (hence why some of our competitors went the way of the dodo).

* back to lack of investment, there's a housing shortage which has driven up housing costs for me. I'm renting, and I *could* buy, but I'm not prepared to sign up for basically 10-15 years salary worth of debt for a box. I studied bubbles at uni and the way they work is people keep putting money in until people can't afford to anymore, and then they pop. If I, on a decent salary, can just about afford a house (at the cheapest rates *ever*), if prices go up again will there be any first time buyers in 5 years time to buy mine? It's a big gamble, and bizarrely renting offers me security against that possibility. I'm simply not as willing to sign up frankly enormous sums of debt as many others.

* edit to add: someone just reminded me, yes I and my girlfriend both had to move 200 miles as the crow flies to get jobs. The amount of qualified people:vacancies ratio in and around Hull &amp; Grimsby in 2011 meant we had no choice if we wanted to get on.

The thing is, even if you have it good, like I do and plenty of others in the thread say they do - the question is *where would you otherwise be*, had the government actually done any notable investment. In a downturn gilts were cheap, labour was abundant and cheap - it was and is the best time for the government to invest. The way our government works though, is we don't borrow or invest when debt is cheap - yet when rates go up and the private sector is investing in the economy, driving up labour costs, I expect we will try to compete and invest then.

It's almost as if the government (in whichever form) actively tries to get the worst deal for the public.",0,1383220382,null,0,1383220800,0,cd3mxbk,t3_1plhfm,t1_cd3mxbk,t3_1plhfm,null,1428914000,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

When they deliberately attack and try to shame the questioner and the audience, and start going on and on like that, it just reeks of well delivered political staging bullshit to me.

I'm not saying the question was necessarily a good or fair one, it was clearly intended to provoke. But I would respect a politician who rather than going on the defensive and getting personal, actually takes that kind of question as a brilliant opportunity to correct all the misunderstandings and inaccuracies that led to the question. He could calmly explain how his words may have been taken out of context, or were misunderstood or maybe he just plain mis-spoke!

Passion in a cause is great, but if you rebut all your opposition like that, you won't change anyone's mind. The opposition isn't going to be like, ""Oh no! Your passion and sharp wit has overwhelmed me! I must rethink my life choices now!"" No, he will also go on the defensive, feeling his pride has been hurt. Then the debate may as well end because once people start debating with their pride on the line, no one is changing their mind.

His kind of style may be fantastic for rousing the people for revolution and shallow political points scoring (perfect for parliament), but it has no place in a real debate where the true goal is to convince people to change their position.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I'm not sure where to go with my line of argument as it is a matter of taste, so very subjective.

Being English doesn't mean that you will like chintzy, garish or vulgar decorations. It doesn't mean that you have bad taste either as England is considered the ""cool"" fashion capital of the World. 

I tend to look at a LOT of real estate pages (it's my addiction) and I see a lot of internal house decorations which make my toes curl. It's the same sensation I get when I see a bright green car, with additions like spoilers and air dams, fake racing stickers and fluffy dice. Someone took the effort to design a car with a pleasant outline and stylish good looks but the buyer thought they could do better by throwing random additions to it.

It possibly fits in with my theory of why certain classes get tattoos and piercings more than other classes. I think it stems from the ability to change and make choices in one's life. If you're down low (economically) then you don't have much in the way of influence on your surroundings. So things like customised cars, customised sofas and tattoos/piercings are the only outlet for influence. It's my pet pop-psychology theory.",0,1383223494,null,0,1383223699,0,cd3njd1,t3_1plxg5,t1_cd3njd1,t1_cd3nefz,null,1428913714,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm one of the lucky ones who is doing a bit better than inflation in terms of income since the downturn but I still seem to have a lot more money than I did in 2007. However, I still keep a closer eye on my spending and don't feel like I have as much money to actually spend.

Perhaps having a family does make a difference, I don't know. And I know that some people are in more difficult situations since the start of the downturn. But I wouldn't be surprised if, for most people, they feel they have less in their pocket simply because they know they shouldn't be piling everything onto credit cards and have started putting some money into a savings account as well.",0,1383223564,null,0,false,0,cd3njvx,t3_1plhfm,t1_cd3njvx,t1_cd3m44k,null,1428913708,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
