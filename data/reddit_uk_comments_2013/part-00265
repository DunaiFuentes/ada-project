true,[deleted],null,null,"I watched Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Doctor episodes as a kid, but my fandom in earnest started with Rose. It's a brilliant introduction to the series, and Eccleston is my favourite Doctor. Well, after McCoy, but we can talk about that another time. 

The reason I suggest *Eleventh Hour* over *Rose* - well, there are a couple, but the main one - is that I've had many people comment to me about how they tried to get into Doctor Who but didn't enjoy Series 1 at all. Looking back, it hasn't aged all that well. It's unfortunate that HD is now the standard and Rose predates that only by a few years, AND there are these weird filters that further blur-up the shots. I love, love, love Murray Gold to death, but the synthesized nature of Series 1's music is a huge reason why many of my friends could not get into it. That may be because I'm an orchestral musician, and we appreciate a decent live-recorded soundtrack, too. The CGI is also marginally worse than what has been presented since. These are all superficial reasons, but I think Series 5 overall serves as a better ambassador for the show than Series 1 does - much as it pains me to admit it.

And really, I don't think the intricacies of *Eleventh Hour* preclude it from being a good introduction. If the story is good enough, and it is, then people will want to watch more and find out more about the character and show without obsessing over the sonic or computers. If they keep watching onto *Beast Below*, *Victory*, *Angels/Stone*, they'll have a decent hold of the show by then.",0,1386486209,null,0,false,0,cdwg1oo,t3_1sd6gf,t1_cdwg1oo,t1_cdwfrpr,null,1428344035,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

- Play football if you don't already. Find a local kickaround team, 5 or 7 a side, turn up and participate. It dosnt matter what skill level you are, thats the best thing about football, its very accessible to all skill levels and sexes. 

- Watch live football when you can. As in, go to your nearest MLS (i read further down that you're from the states) teams stadium, buy a ticket to 3 matches, be there and experience being around people who really love the sport. Its infectious. I started going to see my local league team (Sydney FC) about 4 years ago and, although they're not really good, its always a great atmosphere. And it gives the sport a bit of reality, its not just a game on a screen.

- Enjoy yourself while you watch it. Either at the game or watching Liverpool on the tv or internet. Have something good to eat or drink, a beer, good company etc. 

- If you can, try and find shows like BBCs Match of the Day (links appear on this sub after games). You will see highlights, opinions from managers and players, and more in depth analysis from ex players and other pundits to explain more what you have just seen.

true,jonnyvice,mcgann,McGann,"I think the show up from the Rose episode until DotD was allowed to happen as we experienced it so the War Doctor would know what he would turn into afterwards.  It happened and then the War Doctor could retroactively make his decision.  The moment then additionally allowed 10 and 11 to enter the time and place he made the decision (as evidenced by 10's reaction 'these events are time locked, we shouldn't even be in here' followed by the confirmation of the moment/bad wolf that that was indeed correct and inferring that she allowed it).  

The moment allowed the Doctor to go beyond considering the weight of his actions and follow through, it allowed him to make the same decision 3 times (the 3 Doctors being present and all agreeing).  The whole time the moment allowed this to happen in order to push her alternative solution.

In a very timey whimey sort of way the Dalek's and the Dalek Emporer's description of their escape from the time war did not actually alter from the previous pocket time line the moment allowed to happen.  The Daleks still died in an inferno, we even saw one floating away towards the viewers, 'damaged, but alive'.

Personally I thought it was brilliant and wished the show would treat time travel the same way as we effectively had effect before the cause done on screen and throughout a long 10+ year narrative in a pretty clever fashion.

One might call this lazy retconning, but retconning is where you change the past without consideration to events.  This was great storytelling about time travel.  

In the Star Trek sequel/reboot, it handled it in much the same way.  TOS, TNG, the films, V, DS9, those shows all happened within the narrative of the new film.  The existence of old Spock is evidence of that.  But they would no longer happen the same way they did the first time around.

Similarly, the Doctor experienced both committing genocide against the Time Lords and the Daleks *and* the hiding of gallifrey.

You're in financial trouble because you're working 16 hours a week at almost minimum wage. Full time at minimum wage isn't exactly comfortable. You need to increase one of those two things (more time or more money, preferably both). 

&gt; Quitting my work at the unpaid business is not an option. I can see real progression coming from it

This basically messes up any option for your other job. If you can't leave the unpaid work then you can't get non-shift work which massively limits what you can get. Will this cause problems with JSA? Are you not applying for jobs you might actually be able to get because you don't want to leave that job? That could put your allowance at risk (and it should).

Stop limiting yourself like this. 

&gt; having to actively seek jobs I don't want,

You are not in a position to worry about this. You need more hours or more pay. 

&gt; as well as probably lying to the job centre abouy my availability.

This is fraud. I would also personally consider you being on the JSA and limiting what jobs you apply for fraud, but technically it may not be (although I'm sure they don't look on it favourably). Actually lying to them and getting your hours fixed so you can continue to claim? I'm pretty sure that's fraud.

So your current plan is:

* Annoy and put at risk the only source of income you have
* Commit fraud
* Limit the jobs you look for

I don't know how else to put it, this is a *bad plan*.

I feel the need to put some of this in perspective, given your earnings (not benefits) **you are currently on the poverty line**. Literally pennies above it, if you work 16 hours (edit - see below). You're on less than the state pension by a considerable margin.

With this in mind

&gt; Quitting my work at the unpaid business is not an option.

Yes, yes it is. If another opportunity to work comes up, this should be the only option.

&gt; I can see real progression coming from it.

Unless this is financial progression in the very short term, it is not relevant given the scale of the situation you are currently in.

Edit - poverty

OK, I was wrong when I said you were around the poverty line. You are ridiculously under it. If you earn £70 per week you are in the bottom 1% of earners. Working a solid 15.5 hours per week will get you to the bottom 2%. To hit the poverty line you need to work 27.7 hours at your current wage.

Here's my problem. At £66k, a considerable number of highly-educated, highly-motivated people over the age of 40 who have experienced successful careers outside of politics would need to take pay cuts (sometimes large pay cuts) to become MPs. I understand that £66k is well above the national average, but it's not an exceptional salary for the highest-calibre individuals that we ought to want to stand for Parliament. And that's ignoring all the crap involved in going into politics, going beyond what they face even in 'normal' high-pressure jobs: the stressful late-night decision making, the acute media scrutiny, and (in recent years) the sheer loathing much of the public displays towards *anyone* involved in politics.

You might say that money shouldn't be a factor and the warm glow of public service should be all the reward they need. It's true to some extent, but it would be nonsense to say it's enough to take money off the table altogether. These would be people with families and who have taken out mortgages based on their existing incomes - it would be irresponsible of them to leave behind their existing jobs just because they find Parliament to be a more psychically-satisfying prospect than working as a CEO/barrister/chief of surgery/chief economist/etc.

So instead, we get mediocre politicians, who make mediocre decisions based on their mediocre understanding of the world; we get Ed Miliband and David Cameron.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"*Well...This turned into something much longer than I intended but I guess it's a big topic*

Constitutional conventions are just those unwritten rules mostly limiting the monarch's power that cannot be enforced in courts but are considered to have the same effect as laws through power of tradition alone. In many cases they originate mostly from the Hanoverian dynasty where the German kings didn't want to stay in Britain because they were more concerned with their own land in Hanover. Thus they allowed a minister to be elected the 'First Minister of the Treasury', i.e. the Prime Minister, who would run things in the monarchy's absence. This has been happening for so long that it is generally accepted by judges, lawyers, MPs and indeed the monarch herself that the powers the Prime Minister was given cannot be reclaimed by the monarch. One of the best quotes in English case law comes from a case on this, BBC v Johns (1989) - the BBC was trying to claim it was an emanation of the crown (being the state broadcaster) and thus was entitled to crown immunity from tax. This would have been an extension of the crown's power. Lord Diplock said: 

&gt;'it is 350 years and a civil war too late for the Queen's courts to broaden the prerogative. The limits within which the executive government may impose obligations or restraints upon citizens of the United Kingdom without any statutory authority are now well settled and incapable of extension'. 

This case has been reaffirmed many times and it is therefore the law that the Queen cannot extend her power; I would argue and I think most would agree that reclaiming old powers now exercised by the PM would be extending her power and would thus be illegal. Any royal power that involves governing the country such as declaring war, the right to pardon criminals, appointment of peers, C of E officials and ministers, making treaties etc etc is all done by the PM,  Foreign Secretary or the Home Secretary or another cabinet minister and as such is not really a royal power any more. She still has plenty of powers she must exercise personally; she must appoint the PM after every election, she must dissolve parliament at the end of the year and reopen it, and she must give personal assent to each law. However, again, these powers have not been used in so long it is generally accepted by legal scholars, MPs and the Queen herself that she can't use these powers unless instructed to do so by the government. The last time a law has not been given assent was 1708. The closest it came to happening again was 1914 with the Government of Ireland Bill. However even then it was the government of the time that gave him advise on whether he should withhold assent. This was also a special case (I would argue) because the king had made a personal intervention to stop sectarian violence in Ireland by holding a conference personally to talk about peace thus he must have felt personally involved. In the end the government suspended the act themselves on the day it passed because of WW1.

Again, the monarch has never overruled an election result. It's considered impossible for the monarch to do so. Imagine if she did - who do you think the British public would side with; the election or her? I think they would side with the election and quickly remove all power from the monarch if not abolish it completely. The Queen knows this and monarchs have know this for hundred of years and so they don't do it. It's been so long that it is conventional that the leader if the winning party is PM. Most people view this as meaning it's actually not within the monarchs sole power and is these days both technically and practically illegal. One moment where this may have been close to being broken was when Harold Macmillan was ill in hospital and resigned in 1963. The young Elizabeth II went to see him. He chose Lord Home to succeed him and the Queen duly appointed him. This upset the Conservative party because Home was not their first choice but the Queen can barely be blamed he because she was following the advice of the PM and there had been an election so the convention was not properly relevant. 

Now, I'm interpreting the conventions very strictly as law themselves; all they are is traditional ways of doing things not laws passed by parliament but for all intents and purposes everyone considers them to be law...so they are. That's generally how legal positivism, the most influential theory of law in common law systems, works. 

The royal powers are getting smaller all the time. The case of Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel (1920) says that if the government has a choice between a royal power and a statutory power that does the same thing they should use the statutory power and the royal power is therefore abolished. In the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 the government made running the civil service a government power not a royal one and they made ratification of treaties a government power not a royal one so in both these cases the royal power is abolished. They had been intending to include the power to declare war but didn't. They may do this in the coming years but as you can see, the fact that the Queen can't expand her power and every law passed overlapping a royal power abolishes it means that royal powers are slowly disappearing. In 50 years the Queen might have no power left technically just like the monarch has not been able to practically use these powers for centuries. Either way the only way is down for monarchical power; all it takes is time. ",0,1386496499,null,0,false,0,cdwig2i,t3_1s93rf,t1_cdwig2i,t1_cdw49b4,null,1428342841,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

... and, well, I didn't entirely like it. Didn't like the new intro sequence. Seemed at the time like they were ignoring all that went before (and I still felt a bit that way until Human Nature, but was hooked long before that anyway) and to be honest stuff like the Auton Mickey was pretty painful. Still... got to give it a chance, right? By Dalek I was sold, and Father's Day, and The Empty Child... I teared right up at the end of The Doctor Dances. The new show had the heart and soul I remembered.

There are countless examples of MPs who are not from well-off background, what you probably mean is the cabinet which is a different argument.

Everyone loads up the box against Chelsea, he is going quickly find out he isn't going to have the same opportunity and space he has with Everton. This requires him to be quick with his feet and actually link up. Something he is still very poor with.

Mourinho is a perfectionist. Lukaku makes A LOT of mistakes. It will require a lot of patience from Mourinho, which he is short of.

There is one thing going for him, he is young. Unfortunately, this also means that he needs to mature mentally. He still needs time.

If Chelsea were to overhaul the strikers, they need to find someone who is a more complete and experienced striker who can receive and provide service to the wingers. Cavani would have been the perfect striker for Chelsea, strong in the air, able to hold the ball, actually able to go wide to switch with the wingers and add to the fact that he doesn't mind working defensively.

Of the MPs in Shropshire, your very county, [one went to a comprehensive school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wright_\(politician\)) and [one was brought up in an orphanage, then in foster care in a council house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pritchard_\(politician\)).  If you call being orphaned and foster care sitting pretty, then you really must have a hard life.

And as an aside, you know why MPs have second homes, right? It's not so they can gallivant about on the Cornish coast for six months, it's so that they can live in their constituency and in London, and don't have to commute. Unless you think commuting from Glasgow, Belfast, Bangor, St Ives, Cumbria and the Orknays is a good idea.

It was strange for me as around that time I kind of started to lose interest in Doctor Who, no one else at school had seen the episodes or knew what I was talking about which as silly as it sounds killed a lot of my passion for the show. I loved it but I had no one outside my family to share it with and my attempts to get them to watch it failed. When my dad told me about a new series I wasn't really interested in all honesty but we watched it together as he knew how much I loved the show growing up and he himself used to be a big fan. I loved it from the go (although now looking back I'm very picky on the episodes I like and I can't get away with Matt Smith at all). But I must admit with Doctor Who coming back I did find my love for the old episodes re-watching many of the VHS tapes I used to watch, buying them on dvd for myself, listening to audio adventures and even watching episodes I had never seen but are now available on dvd. 

Excuse me for going on I just wanted to show really that although I wasn't very interested when the show came back, it did have a big impact on my life (if that isn't over dramatic). It got other people watching the show and they themselves found the classics so I finally had people to watch and enjoy the show with.

And you are right to have formed beliefs that have come from your context and experience. You are totally within your right to do this. However, the conclusions you have formed within this context are woefully *wrong.* 

Your whole demeanour across text makes me so uneasy. To think that someone in this day and age would *ask me to leave the country* without having even met me, but just based on his own beliefs is insane. This is the very same form of thinking that got these Muslim Patrol vigilantes put in jail in the first place. The fact you can't see the irony is startling.

&gt; just sadness at the disruption of British society, and I certainly don't hate you.

If you were that ""sad"" you would take *positive* steps to try and amend that, like you know, teach people how to be a positive member of the British society instead of asking them to leave. I'm not sure what kind of homogeneous British mass you are envisioning but to think that the country has gone to shit just because of immigration is painfully misguided.

You may not ""hate"" me by your own admission, but you certainly don't approve of my ""very existence"" in any form because of the simple reason I live here.

You are so ignorant of your own xenophobia, I'm honestly quite shocked. Seriously, your lack of self-awareness and your myopic beliefs have really surprised me. I never knew that people, who consider themselves ""pretty damn left-wing,"" with such hatred for anyone different to them, could actually be like this.

&gt; we can all reach societies we are happy with and avoid the ""curse of vibrancy""

You mean, reach a society *you* are happy with and it's quite clear that your proposal for this is to get rid of the immigrants.

I don't know you, but I will say, being so full of hate isn't going to contribute anything positive to the immigration debate, ever. 

Fanatics will exist in any society, but they are a very small number. Most people, and immigrants too, are just trying to get on with life and take it day by day. They are not spending their time planning the demise of Britain in any way shape or form, so perhaps you should reconsider your stance.

To be honest, you sound like a really bitter person looking for a scapegoat to project his feelings on to. In which case, your intolerance is understandable, but that certainly doesn't make it right.

as follows

MP Salary is 4x the MEDIAN* wage. At current rates this would work out at just over £100,000.

Junior Ministers 5x, Minister 6x, Prime Minister 8x

However the following conditions apply.

MP's may have NO OTHER JOBS.

MP's may own a maxm of £50,000 worth of shares/investments, no more than £10,000 in any one firm. All sums over this must be liquidated and placed into a government bond scheme upon election to be returned to MP as cash upon leaving parliament. The only exception to this is shares in a company for which the MP worked/founded and owned for a period of over 5 years, these may be kept, but the interest must be publicly mentioned whenever there may be a conflict of interest (for instance if it is an Arms Manufacturer, the interest must be mentioned before speaking in Parliament on any Arm's, Military, type matters, and independent commission to advise what is relevant)

A series of blocks of flats to be built within 20mins travel of Westminster Palace, from 2-6 bedroom, each MP will be given a flat of number of rooms required for family + 1 (ie. MP with 2 children would be given a 4 bedroom flat). These flats will be provided rent free for any MP who lives more than 40 mins travel from the Palace.

Upon loosing their seat at an election, the MPs will continue to receive their wage for a period of 9 months. This is to allow resettlement and time to find another job, as they are not allowed to hold a job while an MP. This does not apply to MP's who resign or are ejected from parliament for disciplinary reasons.

Expenses, MPs may run an office, with a suitable number of staff, travel between their seat and london (including their family) may be claimed for. Standard business expenses etc are also acceptable, as per independent watchdog.

Pension. An average salary scheme, run with the same rules of other local government schemes, with the aim of eventually being self funding.

*Full time wage at which half the population working full time earns more, and half the population less, currently approx £25K pa.

The example treebeard has given up there is stupid. Enforcing the law is not useless, and he has given a specific example which he personally disagrees with and suggested it is totally related to somebody being harassed to the point he committed suicide. Which it completely fucking isn't.

Your reasoning is fundamentally defective since you seem to think the police have a magical book, in which they have got written down every crime that has/is/ever occurred/occurring/will occur. Pro tip: they don't. If they choose to enforce law A it doesn't actually mean that they are choosing not to enforce law B. It can also mean that they don't know law B is being broken.

So, where in the past men in, say, Tunisia would often have sex with each other - because sex before marriage is SO forbidden - it's now much more frowned upon than it was in the past, because of the western idea of 'gay'.

true,Ikkath,null,null,"&gt;What's stopping the existence of a 1d vector?

Nothing. Though a single integer in a context free setting doesn't imply that it should be interpreted as a special case of a vector field. Vectors are forced to generalise the idea ordering which is precisely why we then need to consider the norm (or absolute value in an integer) of the vector. Else ordering is higher dimensions doesn't make any sense... If you want more details on the technicalities you should look at [normed spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space) and the idea of such structures having [""orderings""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_vector_space). 

&gt;Nope. (At least in the context of my car example). Larger could easily mean magnitude.

This is where you are incorrect. It is never implied in mathematics that an integer could be a vector quantity if the number is just written as is. That is a further property that needs to be explicitly defined for any of the ""larger being confused with magnitude"" arguments to have any validity.

A further complication is that the definition of a ""magnitude"" can vary. There are definitions that allow for negative ""length"" (they are not positive definite) so again ordering requires more care and convention (see [Lorentz scalar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_scalar)).",0,1386504336,null,0,1386504894,0,cdwjjcx,t3_1sc5c1,t1_cdwjjcx,t1_cdwjgc8,null,1428342333,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There is a discrepancy between how people calculate risk and how they feel about it. For instance, it is far more likely that you will die in a car crash than in a plane crash, and yet far more people report feeling nervous getting on a plane than getting into a car. Presumably one of the reasons is that one feels temporarily out of control whilst on a plane, at the mercy of gravity, potential mechanical failure and the skill of the pilot, whereas one can always stop a car and get out.

Just don't want to be paying to fix shit that should have been fixed before I drove the car away. In 12 months I won't have a leg to stand on legally. There'll be no proof the MOT failure faults were there when I drove it away, **if they were**.

Third year media and comms student here :) I came to Goldsmiths a bit randomly, hadn't even been to an open day but after the initial adaptation period (Goldsmiths is... special, you need an adaptation period) I started really enjoying it. Goldsmith is probs the best decision I've ever made!

As for the course, I really enjoy it. Don't know what you're into specifically but I specialise in journalism and the teaching I've had has been extremely good quality. I'm looking into masters at the moment and some stuff even City do we've studied more thoroughly already. There is a great emphasis on letting people be creative on the course, some excellent modules with top notch lecturers (eg you get James Curran in first year) and if you're interested in journo especially it's a fantastic place to study as it's where the Centre for Media Reform originated so lots of Leveson discussion around. There are also shit lectures but eh. (Don't take the music course in third year. Just don't.)

Best accom would be Loring, Dean House or Chesterman imo. All are ensuite are very close to uni which means close to the SU and pubs. I was in Loring which are the largest halls and certainly knows how to party. 

New X is cool. As Goldsmiths, it might need a couple months of getting used to but now I can't see myself leaving SE London tbh. There are some really great pubs (Royal Albert especially, and New Cross House tad pricy but excellent food), lots of nice food places for all price ranges, there's often stuff to do on campus since the SU is quite active but you're also close to nice dynamic places (Brockley, Deptford, Greenwich, Telegraph Hill + Hilly Fields parks.)

None the less this is slightly deceptive. For one thing, changes to the welfare state over the past ~3 years have shifted more people from welfare into work. So people who would 3 years ago have been claimants now need to work to bring home a survivable income. Now I don't want to get sucked into whether that is moral/fair or whatever - but just as a point the government **did** say they would get more people off welfare and into work - and the evidence says *so far*, they have to some extent achieved that.

The definition of poverty is also a complex one; they define it here as those people surviving on less than 60% of the national **median** average income. But by using that definition they actually define 21% of the UK population as living in poverty (13 million people)... and I'm not sure that is perhaps giving the full picture. I accept that many people in the UK are not well off - but I think it is stretching credulity to claim 21% of Brits live in poverty. It would be interesting to know how incomes are distributed within that 21% - and I suspect its almost certain that the upper end is made up of those in work, and the severe lower end by those out of work (i.e. work does pay - though not necessarily as much as we might like).

Sharia does not and never has applied to non-muslims, from the earliest islamic caliphates to the last, non-muslims were always expected to be treated with tolerance in muslim lands.

*At the time, the Umayyad taxation and administrative practice were perceived as unjust by some Muslims. While the non-Muslim population had autonomy, their judicial matters were dealt with in accordance with their own laws and by their own religious heads or their appointees.[8] They paid a poll tax for policing to the central state.[8] Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that each religious minority should be allowed to practice its own religion and govern itself and the policy had on the whole continued.[8] The Welfare state for both the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor started by Omar had also continued.[8][8] Muawiya's wife Maysum (Yazid's mother) was also a Christian. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were good. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting their rear in Syria,[8] which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire.[8][8] Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious tolerance that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, especially in Syria. This policy also boosted his popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.[9][10]*

Assuming this is even true... it's not surprising. The pressure to appear as someone who isn't on benefits in the UK is astounding. There is such a disdain for the poor and people unable to find work that people may feel the need to appear richer than they are. 

Nobody wants to be judged for not being able to find work (something that's out of their control most of the time) but, ironically, that's exactly what you're doing and promoting.

It makes me sick that this anti-unemployed rhetoric exists; it targets the most disenfranchised people in society precisely because they are too impoverished to stand up for themselves. Urgh, it's disgusting: people are judged for being unable to find work as if there's something wrong with them, then judged again for using the very systems put in place to *help* them. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.

&gt; something they've caused through their own stupidity.

Poverty is caused by stupidity is it? How about poverty is caused by poverty. Can you not see the inherent bias in your beliefs?

&gt; because he uses that income to repay the £40k of debt he got himself into then that is what I find completely abhorrent. 

So what exactly is he supposed to do to get himself out of debt? Ignore it? You'd judge him for that too. Because we all know it's the poorest people in society that don't know how to spend money wisely. Everyone else in the higher social classes? They're practically gods when it comes to debt and money management.

/s

&gt; I can guarantee you some of them are using foodbanks and that they spend more money on fags than it would cost to feed themselves. 

Did you not know that people in lower socioeconomic classes are most likely to smoke? Studies show cigarettes serve as a tool for those of low socioeconomic status to cope with boredom, relieve stress and as a companion to alcohol and caffeine. Cigarettes serve as a loyal “friend” – a theme recognisable from cigarette advertising.

Also associated with that is the inability to give up smoking even if they want to because the most impoverished people in society are more likely to believe they have no control over their lives.

Skrtel is catching shit for the own goals and yes, it sucked.  But he wasn't exactly trying to put the ball in.  We all love Carragher so much and the man scored a fair few in the wrong net during his time.  Ease up on Martin, he's been playing extremely well and he's kept his head in the game despite his bad luck.

As much as I'd love to see Agger in the mix against Spurs his form has just been quite poor and IMO Spurs is our best chance for 3 points from the tough games we have coming up against them, City, and Chelsea.

I guess it depends what kinds of things that you're into. I suffer a little the same as (outside of work) I've become a total homebody lately. I've lived here for years and tend to just do the same old things, but there are still some pretty good things to get out and do.

The Arnolfini has excellent exhibits and often shows films. I try to go every season as there is regular change. They do tour guides also and often the artists themselves are there to talk about their work. Excellent reading room upstairs, great little cafe inside for lunch, it's a great place! It's on the harbour, opposite Za Za Bizarre and the harbourside pub area.

Just south of the centre, in Bedminster, is the Tobacco factory. This theatre has excellent and wide range of shows and often does seasonal things, like the puppets not long ago. They also have pretty regular Shakespeare too! Tickets are reasonably priced and there's pretty much always something I want to see there.

Other than that, it really depends on your interests. There seem to be a lot of groups out there involved in different things. My partner goes to African Drumming over in Stoke's Croft pretty regular, there's all manner of classes (from recreation to self improvement to self defence), things like the Eastern Arts Centre, etc etc. If you want something to do then identify an interest and then seek out a club or space or group that caters for it. I'm sure you'll be really pleasantly surprised by what's available in the city.

If you drive and don't mind travelling a little bit, Weston-super-Mare is just down the road. Classic tacky-seaside, but it's the kind of thing I love. Salisbury/Stonehenge isn't too far also, nor is Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole. Pretty fun to waste a day on those.

I hope that's helpful. Bristol is my favourite city and has been for six years now. I've lived in much bigger cities, but haven't managed to find such a great feel, attitude, or range in anywhere else I've lived to date!

We sat watching the animal show in the wooden auditorium.  It was really a barn with some plywood stepped seating, and felt rather rickety.  All was fine, until the very last animal was walked in, a donkey.  I had rather zoned out during the presentation, and hadn't really listened much.  I had noticed the rather... odd.. posters around which had HUGE titles and much tiny text, and was trying to work out what they said as we were quite far away from them and couldn't make it out.  There was something not quite right with this place.

""...and the donkey has a cross on its back, which represents the suffering of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ"".

You *what*?  Did he actually just say that to the massed throngs?  There was general confusion and murmuring around us, as if a hundred or so people had just had a mass religious auditory hallucination.  No-one could quite understand what they had heard.

Animal petting time.  Our daughter went up to stroke the sheep or whatever other animals they had brought in.  I got a look at the posters, which were properly weird.  As in, the Earth is 6,000 years old weird, Darwin was a liar, dinosaurs shared the Earth with man, that sort of thing.

There was a ""soft play"" area which wasn't soft.  More of the plywood stuff, really, asking for some kid to break their neck on it, in some bizarre attempt at invoking divine protection or something.  Sad looking rhinos that looked like they'd seen better days.  A bumpy trip on a tractor trailer to see Portishead from the top of the hill.  And my wife got spat on by an angry alpaca.

'The government can read your emails' is a scary as hell concept. Article 8 (off memory) is the right to a private and family life. To 'read all your emails' without specific cause would violate that. 

After the NSA scandal (which is still ongoing and is creating ripples in the political world as we speak) people are a LOT more aware of the covert surveillance world. 

The issue is the misinformation. We do not know specifically (to my knowledge) the full extent of probes like this, and I doubt it will be released anytime in the next 20/30 years due to national security. We know some of what has been happening, and it's very concerning to say the least. 

A lot of this comes down to a fear someone may become a victim of a 'enemy of the state' style scenario. 

I'm not justifying anything as I don't know the full extent of what's gone on or what laws have been broken, and which jurisdiction it will be decided under, but when it comes down to it the overall intent of the NSA (and gchq in the UK, albeit it not the same extent) is security. Yes somewhere along the lines the line has been crossed.

My understanding of it so far is a large amount of emails are scanned for 'keywords' (bomb, etc) and if the email has too many there shall be an escalation procedure in place. This is what email has become, this is the world we live in. 99.999999% of the time this isn't an issue. Let me move this to a real world example:

would you walk into a supermarket and not be expected to be captured on CCTV? If you do not expect it, then you would go somewhere else, but nowadays, due to supermarkets being a victim of criminals, nearly all supermarkets have CCTV. 

The security scanners on the entrance/exit that go off if you have one of those tags that attach to clothes, they are there because people steal clothes. You get scanned every time you walk in/out. Sometimes innocent items can set off the scanners, which is what the security is there for. Yes there is a concern for the human element, however there are laws around theft which apply to security. 

There are also laws regards the scanning of emails. If it is found they have been broken/violated then they should face reprisals by the courts. 

If you do not want your emails scanned, don't send emails. If you don't want to be caught on CCTV, either choose places that don't, or go live in the woods, or go to the Amish community. Everything you do online can be tracked. Bear it in mind.

Just because it can be tracked, doesn't mean it is.

My Dad is an avid fan of the show (he grew up with Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker), and ever since I was really little I remember waking up early in the morning just to go in the living room and watch some classic doctor who before school.

It really started with the 40th anniversary, as at that point UKTV Gold played all of the (then) archived episodes in order for the occasion, and my Dad started purchasing the DVDs.

When the re-boot started I was 6 - and completely gob-smacked and utterly excited. I was finally about to get &gt;my own&lt; doctor - and episodes were going to air where my Dad didn't know the ending!

When it started I was glued to the screen, and I still am! I still watch the classic episodes for nostalgia (especially Remembrance of the Daleks  - I must have watched that about 20-odd times) but it was a big part of my childhood even before the reboot. Christopher Eccleston is still my favourite doctor for this reason.

I remember when the teaser aired for the episode 'Dalek' and I couldn't contain myself for the following week. It was the daleks! THE daleks! Dalek is probably still my favourite episode of all time, because whenever I watch it I just get exited 6 year old me feeling and I love it :3

To be honest, that was not my intention, I've fixed it, or will do shortly. I was trying to point out the bias in his views. I didn't do it properly, obviously.
&gt; even if they fritter it away on stupid stuff, that it's not their fault. People need to start taking responsibility for themselves.

No I'm saying the blame he is placing on such people is not fair. He's saying poverty is their fault, but the fact is, it's not easy to get out of poverty. Maybe that didn't come through properly. The UK is one of the most, [least socially mobile developed countries going](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Country_comparison), so it's not going to be easy to just work their way out of poverty.

&gt; However, I see people that I work with who go out every weekend, smoke, drink, have the latest phones and games consoles and they'll blame other people because they're in debt and can't afford the essentials. 

But it's not just poor people that's in debt. Most people, of any class, are in debt. They just buy different things. This economy is run on taking out debt to pay for things you can't really afford in the hopes you can pay it back later. Why are poor people being blamed for something literally everyone else does?

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"I watched an IPSA spokesman on the news earlier justify their decision. He was being quite coy but to paraphrase:

The current generation of MPs are untalented plebs and are frankly incompetent. What we want is the kind of talent that can run large organisations like the health service, all the schools, the MoD, etc.

The market rate for that is considerably more than existing MP and ministerial pay so as a result, the most talented people don't consider running and we end up with, well, what we have. You get what you pay for in MPs.

By bumping the salaries up, the expectation is that more talented people will end up in Parliament and running core government services and the quality of Parliament and government will increase.

To be honest, I struggle to find a problem with that logic. A competent CEO and their management team can all expect to earn six figures making and selling shit. Why would we not want them to get paid a similar amount to run the NHS or Foreign Office? A competent minister running the entire school system who is 50x more talented than Michael Gove would cost each taxpayer 0.014p/year to pay £500k. I'd be happy with that.

If everyone's income is increased due to a 'basic income', then the cost of rent goes up. It doesn't remain the same. People still remain poor comparatively. 

What is preferable is if prices of things like rent are either reduced to a realistic affordable level or accommodation becomes available on the free maket to suit all income levels. Prices get reduced only if people refuse to pay them. At the moment, people willingly pay far too much for rent because they don't factor in other living expenses when calculating how much they can afford to pay. It's like a lemming approach because once one person starts paying too high a percentage of their wage for rent, then everyone has to start doing it. 

It's pointless giving people supplementary free money when it means the price of things just go up comparatively. ",0,1386522203,null,0,1386522446,0,cdwnk0q,t3_1sd5ea,t1_cdwnk0q,t1_cdwj20m,null,1428340457,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

However, articles like this annoy me too. The exaggerated horror and indignation to which they all cling rings as false as the ""scientific"" claims from Creationists. Case and point:

&gt; Now, it incenses me that Lego produces a set where cavemen appear alongside dinosaurs

Incenses? Really? Lego is about imaginative play. What kid learning about dinosaurs doesn't put themselves in scene with a triceratops? Should all such things be banned? Never screen One Million Years B.C. again? 

Science advances on two main principles, imagination and accident. Real scientific breakthroughs happen in chairs and bathtubs when a scientist imagines how a mechanism works, then they do empirical testing. This may prove the theory, or at least provide evidence. 

During testing or observation elsewhere, something often goes wrong, mistakes are made, accidents happen and something unexpected occurs. Then a scientist will try to replicate the effect and explore what's going on. 

Being horrified that children's play is not restricted to historic fact or future possibility is to argue for constraints on imagination which might limit their development. Context in play matters very little to kids, so why get het up about it? After all, how many of these Lego dinosaurs are going to be piloting space ships once they've been brought home?

Your argument starts to look shaky when you consider the meaning of the reasonable expectation of privacy.

It would be unreasonable, and nigh on impossible, to expect total anonymity in public, whether it be in the supermarket or an internet forum. Our reasonable expectations of privacy changes to the situation we find ourselves in. A staff member in a local supermarket may recognise me, but I reasonably expect that person doesn't know my intimate private details, such as my NI number, or bank balance, or medical history.

Jurisprudence recognises the reasonable expectation of privacy too, it's why we have the warrant system/reasonable suspicion (up until recently apparently), and is also why the European Courts have ruled the Stop and Search powers of the Terrorism Act 2000 to be unlawful and a violation of our Human Rights under Article 8.

Home form has been a worry. With our dependence on counter-attack football, when we're at home, or away to poor teams (like Fulham), we lose all creativity. Lambert needs to sort this out and soon.

Before today, away form had been terrific. We were sitting in 3rd on the away table with our only loss being the questionable 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. Due to Fulham's poor form, today was essentially played like a home match (we actually managed a decent % possession) and it cost us.

New signings have been hit and miss for me. Bacuna had been fantastic at times but is simply not good enough defensively for a RB, I'd like to see him in midfield. Tonev has moments. He's great at getting forward and I'm convinced he'll score a screamer soon, but at the moment his final delivery just isn't good enough. Kozak seems rather inefficient. Despite his build, he seems unable to hold the ball up. Credit to him however, he has scored a few. I'm disappointed we haven't seen more of Helenius. Okore looked great before his injury.

Overall, we're sitting comfortably mid-table and are getting results even when he don't perform, something that never happened last season. I think to hold on to where we are we need to improve home form, get a second tactic that's not counter attacking and hope Benteke returns. January transfer window I would like a creative midfielder. Our midfield is different but I think we need someone to give us another route; a flair player.",0,1386526140,null,0,false,0,cdwp5n4,t3_1se09c,t1_cdwp5n4,t3_1se09c,null,1428339699,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

Now go and find out.

Did you find out that no MP has been recalled in living memory *because it's not actually possible*?

The reason MPs don't get recalled is not because of their competence. It's because most people don't know if it's even possible, and those who look into it realise that the Government plan to introduce legislation for it ""when parliamentary time allows"".

I would argue that by getting more talent into Parliament, it's less likely such a process would ever be needed.

The fix to the snide cynicism and distrust that most people have towards Parliament is not to make it a more onerous and horrible job that you can be fired from based on knee-jerk populism: it's to attract better people into those positions. 

Paying every single MP £500k/year would cost each tax payer in the UK (around 42m of us, IIRC), an average of £7.74/year each.

Absolutely. By the time you've got to the point you can't afford food then your borrowing has got out of control and the situation is irrecoverable.

Yes... and no. In reality it is very complex but on the whole unemployment is falling and benefit claimants are getting fewer - but not at the same rate. There are far more people not claiming benefits than there are people who are now in work.

&gt; Your second point basically boils down to ""I don't accept this definition of poverty as I am incredulous that 13 million people could actually be in poverty"".

Again - yes, you're sort of right but not really. My point is, using their definition (anyone below 60% of the median average income) would be classed as living in poverty... now even if every man woman and child in the UK was 1000 times richer than any other nation on the planet, that definition would still class 21% of them as living in poverty.

As others have said, in some parts of the UK you could live a fairly fulfilling and happy life at around the 60% median income (all be it a frugal one). What that statistical device is really encouraging is more equitable income distribution (i.e. where most people earn within a fairly narrow range of salaries, from the highest earner to the lowest). Now I'm not saying better income distribution isn't an admirable goal (*although I don't think it necessarily is... but lets not get into that*) - I'm just saying income inequality is not strictly the same as poverty, even though the two certainly do overlap.

Defining poverty is actually very difficult and economists struggle with it the world over. They tend to separate definitions into either ""true poverty"" (where you can't afford the basic things you need to survive) or ""relative poverty"" like the above definition (where other people have a significantly larger amount of money than you). Personally, I would say the latter definition isn't really *poverty* at all, it's income inequality. There is a world of difference between not being able to buy food and not being able to buy food at M&amp;S.

I would make the case that if 21% of the UK is living in **relative poverty**, there exists a sufficiently large market for goods and services within that group that they can live a sufficiently meaningful existence. i.e. they can still acquire food and water that is safe, travel, train/educate themselves etc. Provided they have the social means to improve their income/quality of life (i.e. through work/better qualifications/training etc.) then there isn't anything amoral about 21% of the population having less money.

**Tl:dr** - This article is using a definition of relative poverty rather than the more emotive definition of true/absolute poverty. What it really means is people are less well off, but it doesn't make any attempt to quantify the impact of that on their quality of life.",0,1386535687,null,0,false,0,cdwtlyw,t3_1sd5ea,t1_cdwtlyw,t1_cdwso57,null,1428337620,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It didn't force Labour to sell off the gold reserves, or squander the billions raised by auctioning radio frequencies for 3G networks. The global financial crisis didn't force Labour to spend 20 billion quid on a largely failed NHS IT project, or a few billion on ID cards for that matter.

I don't think it was the global financial crisis that encouraged New Labour to spend tens of billions on a fraudulent war in Iraq, and neither do I think it was the global financial crisis that caused them to spend 6 years doubling expenditure on the NHS without there being any significant improvement in the service.

New Labour came to power in 1997 with a government current account that was in the black, with borrowing at a relatively small proportion of GDP, and left government with a massively overdrawn current account and borrowing at 25% of annual expenditure.

true,Rodoc,eng-GreaterLondon,East Laaandan,"As a junior doc in 2008 I saw a 68 year old female retired piano teacher who had been left baby sitting her granddaughter by her own daughter. They were a very respectable middle class family. The grandmother came in with a headache, and the baby.

I took her history and the daughter arrived, very worried about her Mum. One of the routine questions you ask is ""any alcohol, smoking, drugs?"", fully expecting such a conservative woman to say no. But she hesitated. I realised you wouldn't be nervous about saying you drink or smoke, so I asked ""have you taken any drugs?"" The daughter said ""don't be so ridiculous"" but her 68 year old Mum finally said:

""I might have snorted some coke""

She had a massive intracranial bleed, her brain scan was more blood than brain and she required immediate brain surgery. She died.

Having said all that, I find it hard to believe people are presenting to A&amp;E with cannabis overdoses, no matter what age. And if they're claiming that former hippies are the ones smoking up in their 70s, then they're the LEAST likely to panic and go to hospital.

Tonev...I just think he needs time to adapt and a bit of experience. He's very quick, strong, has a good touch, an eye for a pass and an eye for goal. Unfortunately his decision making is very poor. That is what needs work. He needs to learn not to shoot from all angles when it isn't on. He needs to think before he runs himself into trouble. But I definitely see a player in there eventually. 


I thought Herd did Ok today, especially considering he hasn't played a first team game in nearly a year. Herd is a better defender than Lowton and a much better centre back, which is why he played. Personally I would have played Lowton Clark Baker Bacuna as my back 4, but I'm not Lambert. 


Also worth noting Lowton was at fault for 1 goal against Southampton, kicked Osvaldo who should have had a penalty, and very nearly gifted Berbatov a goal here today.

I read this looking for the magic bullet and have been sadly disappointed.

Fundamentally you only get to retire at 55 if you've had a very good job, and contrary to what Boris says, you get one of those by being exceptional at politics rather than through ability or IQ.

The ISA stuff is rubbish - Britain is a declining country and our stock market hasn't moved numerically (never mind inflation adjustment) since 2000 and may well plummet when American QE ends. People will have to trade that ISA for a property when the time comes and property prices are so extortionately high now that the joke of paying one down early is becoming just that. Some people do start their own business, but 80% fail and the owner ends up worse off, and I know very few house borrowers with settled finances in their 40s now as 38 is the normal first time buyer age and it won't be long before that's also the age at which people have their first child.

My father retired in his 50s for one reason only - he was good at the politics and his company were willing to offer him ""twice"" his final salary dues to leave early and make way for younger minds. Not only are such offers a thing of the past, but the sort of stuff board room executives did in the 80s is now expected of lower middle management in the 10s. The simple reality of the new century is that if you don't qualify in one of the professions and quickly politic yourself to the top, you're not going to make it and retiring at 70 is probably an over optimistic dream.",0,1386542444,null,0,false,0,cdwwvh8,t3_1semsx,t1_cdwwvh8,t3_1semsx,null,1428336039,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

Here is some real advice.

1: don't assume the next thirty years are going to be like the last. Governments won't be able to go on increasing debts forever, oil is getting more expensive, huge unfunded liabilities are coming due over the next decade. Think of how you can profit from this.

2: Understand the power of compounding returns.

3: Become a contrarian. As Warren Buffet says, ""Be fearful when people are greedy, and greedy when people are fearful.

4: learn how to properly diversify. A mixed portfolio of stocks is not diversification. I mean stocks, commodities, currencies, and real estate.

5: In order to get some kind of portfolio together its likely you're going to have to REALLY cut down on all costs for a few years.

I take issue with a couple of points though. This one for instance:

&gt; A culture of worklessness becomes entrenched when young people can leave school and go straight on to the dole with nothing expected in return

He's not wrong, this is an issue for a small section of society - emphasis on small -  however it's not the limiting factor when there aren't enough jobs to go around. Once we're at the point where the demand for workers matches the supply, then we can look at addressing the causes of unemployability. Until then it's just a smokescreen to shift the blame for high unemployment away from a broken economy and towards the victims of same.

&gt; Employers’ surveys repeatedly reveal dissatisfaction with the level of literacy and numeracy in the prospective workforce, and among existing workers. 

Given the number of university graduates who are taking low skilled jobs because they can't find work in their field, this surprises me.

I don't know what you mean by that.  But:

Not a single one of those examples is cannabis killing someone.

If someone is drunk, drives their car into a lamp post, that's not alcohol killing them.  People doing stupid things under the influence of any drug is not new, but it's also not relevant to what I said

&gt; the only way cannabis can kill you is if a pallet of the stuff falls on you.

I was up at my grandfather's in Upstate New York one year and he had limited channels and I found this odd show on PBS up there. When I came back home to South Carolina, I found out SCETV ran Doctor Who episodes. They used to play after Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers after school. I started in on Pertwee towards the end of his run and then saw him regenerate into Tom Baker. (I blame Planet of the Spiders and then Ark in Space for my fear of spiders.) Later they moved the show to Saturdays and they'd show entire stories instead of singular episodes. It was a joy.  I was probably the only person in my South Carolina town who had ever heard of it (and my sister even gave me a weird nickname that she calls me to this day ""Dodor"" because she mockingly called the show ""Dodor Whooser"").  

I was so excited in 1996 when I heard about the tv movie. It was fun seeing the TARDIS again and I liked the movie (aside from the half human thing) and hoped for more.  When I heard about the return in 2005, I was a bit wary. I admit, being in America I couldn't wait to see the episode. (Now though, I have BBC America basically just for the Who.) I made my kids and wife watch with me and they thought it was ok. Then came Tennant and they've been hooked ever since. I have to tell you, it makes me feel awesome that the big part of my nerd life (as big a comic book and sports and sci fi and fantasy and Trek and whatnot fan I am Doctor Who is my biggest love) is now popular throughout the world and in my own family. We all gathered for the telecast of the anniversary and I looked over and smiled as my kids and my wife all were intently watching something I really love.  Of course, when I heard the voice at the end, I squee'd pretty badly and got yelled at by my oldest daughter.

It's the idea that a country has to live within its means that's confused. It's not practically possible for all countries to run an external surplus at the same time because one country's surplus is another country's deficit. 

If the UK runs a surplus (lives ""within its means""), then another country has to run a deficit (live ""beyond its means""). That's how individual economies balance each other out on a global scale. 

The idea that all countries can run a surplus makes no sense at all. We can't all be thrifty and export at the same time, because if we did, who would be buying those exports? Martians? 

The global economy works because we have creditor nations like Germany and China and debtor nations like Greece, the US and the UK. The system needs debtors if there are going to be creditors, by definition. 

If the UK decides it wants to be more like Germany, all that means is that another country has to live ""beyond its means"". 

We can't all cut at the same time, that's why historically the US, the UK and Greece spent the way that they did. ",0,1386548829,null,0,false,0,cdwzryi,t3_1sea0g,t1_cdwzryi,t1_cdwuxpk,null,1428334611,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Are we finished "" and he just kept looking straight ahead, wouldn't even say "" keep watching "" I look back at the telly, the ball is coming to Gerrard, my friend says in almost a sinister tone "" HIT IT "" with a stern look on his face, like he was actually telling Stevie to hit it or he was in trouble,  and then you know what happened next.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"Spurs didn't play that well against Sunderland but they have a lot of pace and strength in their team. I think if you go ahead against them, you have a huge chance of winning the game, because they lack creativity and are easy to suppress because they build slowly. I think being cautious, while looking for a goal on the counter would give us a great chance. I don't see them scoring many goals, but with our defence you never know. 

I really think beating Spurs would be huge for us, they will inevitably improve over time as their team gels but we'll create a 6 point gap between us and them with a win. If we lose we are level on points, and by that point we may be below Arsenal, City, Chelsea and Everton. We need to keep us this good start!

I think we'll beat Cardiff, they aren't anywhere near as threatening away from home. Hopefully Aspas plays that game, we may need him over the busy Christmas period.

Chelsea and City will be incredibly tough, not only because of their quality but because of the timing and both games being away. Not terribly optimistic about these games, draws would be fine. Especially since the bigger sides have all been dropping points away from home, but assuring they perform at their own grounds. 

I think Gerrard will be a big miss, his presence is huge. However, he does usually need to be subbed out after an hour so having him and Lucas (who's fitness is really poor) both on the pitch may have been a big factor in our poor 2nd half performances. Despite the energy Allen will bring, we will miss Stevie's set pieces, and penetrative passes. He is still our only midfielder capable of consistently finding Suarez / Sterling in pockets of space from deep.

Suarez and Coutinho are going to have to perform incredibly well for us to play well over the next few weeks. Suarez often hides our lack of attacking threat, with Henderson as our fourth attacking player we do lack another goalscorer in the side. Coutinho and Sterling can improve in this regard. Not sure if Aspas is ready to step in.

Probably alone on this but I havent been too impressed by Skrtel recently, he sits too deep, makes mistakes that you simply cannot overlook. Problem is Agger doesn't look to be in good form either. Hopefully Rodgers finds a solution as this is by far our weakest area of the side.

Also, Flanagan will be torn apart by Lennon / Lamela / Navas / Mata. Hopefully Kelly can play, he never looked out of place.

If there's one thing every person on the planet is an expert on, it's the human face, and we *know* when something is off about it. I wouldn't trust ILM with a half a billion dollar budget to make a CGI'd human face that didn't reek of the uncanny valley, much less the BBC, as much as their production value has skyrocketed in recent years with Doctor Who.

It's been shown recently that David Bradley makes a pretty decent William Hartnell, and he actually had to talk and act like him too!

To quote your previous post: 

&gt;&gt; if they try enough times they are bound to get lucky once

In which you appear to be paraphrasing this PIRA statement

&gt;[[...] Today we were unlucky, but remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always [...]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_hotel_bombing#IRA_statement)

Which creates the desired level of fear and uncertainty stated in the aims of every terrorist group. In light of the attempted car bombing in Belfast, people now have to consider that once again this is a possibility more than at any time in recent memory. Especially since the target appeared to be the Police, the Courts and Victoria Square, which is a shift from previous targets.

&gt;As for the politics, why does politics even come into it? They are very obviously a minority and they apparently have zero legitimate political support, why even mention politics when they have absolutely nothing to do with politics what so ever. 

The modern groupings are Anti-SF *dissident* Republicans who disagree primarily with SF's stance on the PSNI and on ""administration of British Rule"" - what makes this even more problematic is the fact they refuse to engage in political dialogue, which was eventually forced on the PIRA.

They have minor support, but they seek to make a violent impact. Consider how embittered a section of the loyalist vote is at present, and then consider the stepping up of this current dissident campaign and how that can possibly create instability. Political now?

&gt; They are just a gang of idiots who can't let go of the past.

They wear the past as a badge of honour - ""They"" did not accept the PSNI, like the ""traitorous SF"". The phrase ""living in the past"" does not delegitimize them in the frame of starry-eyed Republicanism in the way you would assume.

&gt; Stop trying to legitimize them by mentioning politics. 

Stop trying to put words in my mouth. I said they were dangerous. You said they were ""retarded"". Being ""retarded"" doesn't make them less dangerous. Dismissing a grouping that can source, build and deliver a viable 65kg bomb into the centre of Belfast is dangerous.

&gt; Do not legitimize these people, I do not accept that violence or hatred or prejudice have any place in politics, you shouldn't either.

Then you would have a half hour chapel service, then 3 35 min lessons until 10:40. Half an hour break where you can get toast, then another three lessons until lunch at 12:45 which lasted until 1:30. Then you would have two of the following, depending on the day. An after school activity (carpentry, fives, DofE, music practice, the like) mandatory sport (rugby, cricket, hockey, athletics, cross country) or another 2 lessons. Each of these three would last around an hour and a half with small breaks in between. This takes you up to around 4:30, when you are technically free, but there are optional times to speak to teachers to improve areas where you are struggling academically, religious meetings, more optional sports, choir practice and things like that on.

This takes you up to 6, when there is supper until 7.

7-9 is homework time where you are in your room revising or reading. You are quiet, in theory not socialising (very loosely applied) or just resting. Then from 9-10 you have free time. After 10 you are meant to be asleep or working.

This is the theory. In reality, you spend a lot of time just hanging out with friends and talking after you have gotten stuff done. 

I went 5 years without a detention. Our punishments were usually just being forced to sign in with the housemaster every hour for a certain period of time (which is time consuming and annoying). The next punishment level up was to shovel shit in the stables for an hour in the morning. That was for people who did not do what the housemaster wanted.

This was just my experience, other schools will vary.

In addition, you have sport against other schools on Wednesday afternoons and Saturdays, and team training on Friday afternoons.

I think it was an easy way to slip Nine in, as well as giving a nod to the 10th Anniversary Special from 1973, when they used old footage of Hartnell in the monitors (since he was too ill to be included along with Pertwee and Troughton).

For the 20th Anniversary Special in 1983, they used a Hartnell lookalike (much as they did this year). At that time Baker chose not to be included, and they respected that, much as they did with Eccleston.

true,puckyou,flair7,,"I think it has to do a lot with many people being attracted to supporting Arsenal because they are a good team yet not good enough that people who choose to support them are considered gloryhunters. This contributes a great deal to there being a lot of Arsenal fans, which means that there is a larger population that would contain people wanting to come over to the Spurs subreddit and troll compared to other teams (like those in your example.) 

People choosing to support Arsenal because they don't want to be considered gloryhunters often do this because they want to feel superior to others. They want to feel that they are better fans because they support a team that doesn't always win because it makes them feel. This leads to a group that has a fairly large share of people with the need to prop themselves up and make themselves feel superior relative to other fan groups meaning that they are more likely to do things like coming over to a rival team's subreddit and make stupid posts poking fun at the other team's fans.

Finally, on reddit most Premier League fans are not actually from England never mind the city that the team they support resides in. Meaning that these people feel the need to justify their choice in Premier League team. Arsenal have not won anything recently meaning that there really isn't much to brag about. As a result they decide to gloat over Spurs since Arsenal are still the much more successful of the two clubs.

The police cannot chase them because it poses to great a risk to the rider as they aren't wearing a helmet. It is ridiculously stupid.

Eccleston's reasons for leaving the role continue to be debated in Britain's newspapers: on 4 October 2005 Alan Davies told The Daily Telegraph that Eccleston had been ""overworked"" by the BBC, and had left the role because he was ""exhausted"". Ten days later, Eccleston told the Daily Mirror this was not true, and expressed some irritation at Davies for his comments. In a 2010 interview, Eccleston revealed that he left the show because he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that the cast and crew had to work in"", but that he was proud of having played the role.

As the article pointed out, this could have been an opportunity to demand global regulation of the banks' abdication of responsibility. This he did not do. Should this article be accurate, what he succeeded in doing was delaying an inevitable crash in the financial sector, and by delaying it, probably making it far worse. In fact, he created then a situation in which banks had to be bailed out twice.

At least the second time, the bailout was more transparent, and banks had to repay the money, or the government received shares for their financial contribution. The first time smacks of collusion at the taxpayers' expense. One might say his behaviour was both arrogant and naive. He was a man after all, who freudiently slipped that he had 'saved the world' during what might be the second round of bailouts.

The article also mentions transparency of government, but there was none here. Gordon Brown took it upon himself to bail out an international financial system with British taxpayers money while failing to even attempt to secure the system itself.

Her father died young because he was a miner and he had breathing problems and her mother was ill with cancer, plus a diabetic brother who ended up dying in his teens. She worked as a typist then eventually as a secretary for 20 years. She has almost no formal education and girls were encouraged to leave school quickly anyway. She was actually interested in art and woodwork but no way she could have the luxury of studying for it because her family needed her to earn money and it was socially unexpected for her to do something like that. My father was well off enough to do his A-levels, which he did badly in and his parents cut him off after that. But he got a job in an office and worked his way up, eventually becoming pretty successful. But it wasn't quick, he did busy work like making coffee and filing for 5 years before someone gave him a proper chance.

So yes they were fortunate in that their house massively increased in value and they had economic boom for most of their working lives (thus stable employment) and now they get pensions etc. But that stuff didn't come easy for them and they had nothing like the opportunities and the security that our generations have. You can study and your family are provided enough to live on so that you don't have to support them. And education is free all the way to 18. And despite tuition fees, uni is still free to attend and open to pretty much anybody, with an agreement that you pay back what you can once you can afford it. 

I've researched into it and really there is no country decidedly better than the UK. Everywhere has ups and downs and IMO we are pretty balanced.

You got that half right.  Tonev has two eyes for goal, if he wore glasses he'd have four eyes for goal.

That doesn't define them as being a club fan. Being a sports club fan isn't a title given to anyone, its something someone chooses to take and live on ( or change ). Nobody is given the right or the title by someone. 

I agree to the fact that this was indeed shameful but this is something those few loud fans had their opinion about. This doesn't make them a bad club fan, this just makes them bad a person/individual. I would hate to know them as a person but as a fan I don't think you would shrug them off either. 

You might have a different opinion about this but I say all this based on fans I've met. Some fans are rude and assholes at times but during the match we are drunk and enjoying the game, their personal opinion won't be bothering anyone during the game and after the game  something non-club related is ignored by me. After the game I mostly won't keep in touch with them unless until planning to watch the game together at the local sports bar. 

Similarly goes with players, even though they represent the club and their actions directly affect the club's reputation. I don't try to take it personally or take it against them. What they do off-field I have kept a rule to not be bothered about it when talking about them about their game. Many players have in fact done shameful things in their personal life but you don't add that to their character when talking about the game and their play. You tend to ignore it or don't be bothered mainly because you really don't care much how good or bad they are as a person.

This is my opinion and something I tend to follow to understand the simple fact when it comes to the fans the ones you like to talk to, be with or discuss could be assholes and mean with other things but related to the game they are fair and you cannot stick it to their character and ignore them.",0,1386566434,null,0,false,0,cdx7fyp,t3_1se2jk,t1_cdx7fyp,t3_1se2jk,null,1428330962,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

When you say the pressure would destroy him do you mean the pressure of having to lead a team that attempts to win everything it plays in? Because the pressure of the premier league certainly didn't seem to get to him even when he was at West Brom. 

I just don't see him doing a worse job than Torres (who hasn't been terrible, mind), he wouldn't have a shortage of competitive minutes here, and he would gain a wealth of experience playing and training with the people who he will actually be expected to play with when we eventually deem him fit to lead Chelsea's line.

Aspas can come on and take Alberto's spot. Or Alberto could then push outside to take off Sterling if needed. Allen can come on for Lucas as his fitness is rather poor. Hell, if we need to, we can throw Moses in any of the 4 attacking or outside midfield roles

I don't know this for certain, but the chances of it happening have been increasing steadily for a very long time as we've been able to see what communities are willing to do to keep their money and name. People need to stop blindly putting their faith into cracked and broken science. Realise that so much in the textbooks is outdated, misconstrued and misleading. 

You might stop patting yourselves on the backs and affirming yourselves within and amongst yourselves (circular reasoning) for just a moment, and consider the implications of allowing any reasonable questioning not just to happen, but to be encouraged and answered to the best of available ability, then the only realisation left is that we have incredible amounts to leave behind, and still far more to learn. 

And above all curricula is the defining education, that of the character. Technology cannot solve world hunger and knowledge alone is not capable of saving even one life.

Last season Man U won the league with 86 goals, giving them 2.26 goals per game on average. The most goals scored in a season was by Chelsea in the 2009/10 season with 103 goals, giving them a 2.71 goals per game.

Looking over time, there has been in increase in goals from the 1990s to the 2000s and most recent seasons. From the 1992/93 season to the 1999/00 season the average top scoring team had 2.10 goals per game. From the 2000/01 season to last season that increased to 2.22. Over the last five season the average was 2.30, but with a variation between 2.02 (Liverpool 77 goals in the 2008/09 season) to Chelsea's record of 2.71. All these numbers are for the top scoring clubs in each season, taken from premierleague.com.

So, Liverpool's number beats the PL average overall, for the 90s and after the 90s. It doesn't beat the average for the last five seasons, but it's only 0.04 behind.

A well structured setup without much free time. I know during my time at school (between 11 and 18) things changed as I got older. By the end I had a lot of free time and not as many extra-curricular activities.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Technology, science and even manufacturing don't pay near the amount for a MP currently yet they don't flood to becoming one.

I am not an exceptional case and I don't want to make this about me, but I work in the technology sector and earn more than an MP does. 

According to the job market ads out there right now, I am not well paid for my experience - I have stock options but I could probably earn more basic salary if I moved. I do not work for a hugely well-known company, I just have a decent amount of experience (I'm in my mid-30s and been in this sector since my mid-20s), and take a lot of responsibility within my firm.

I'd say out of my peer group, less than half of them will be earning below £65k/year. These are not people working for companies you are likely to have ever heard of: just run-of-the-mill technology firms paying market rates for the skills they need.

My brother-in-law is a post-doc researcher in biochemistry about 5 years into his career proper after getting his PhD. He will out-earn me within 5-10 years unless I jump up a rung on the ladder and work for a much larger firm at a similar level of seniority as I am now.

A senior manager at a high-tech manufacturing facility will be out-earning an MP's salary. Think McLaren, Rolls-Royce, etc. - do you honestly think the managers they're recruiting are earning £40k/year? You're insane. The market will happily pay them twice that.

I know you think that the £66k MPs currently earn sounds like a lot of money, but if you are good at what you do and have worked in the science, tech or engineering industries for more than a decade and done a good job it, and then have the interpersonal skills to make management decisions, be productive and compassionate and get to the point where you can look after a larger team/delegate tasks, set down KPIs, and coach/mentor people, etc. well, it all starts to look a bit thin.

&gt;The ISA stuff is rubbish - Britain is a declining country and our stock market hasn't moved numerically (never mind inflation adjustment) since 2000 and may well plummet when American QE ends. People will have to trade that ISA for a property when the time comes and property prices are so extortionately high now that the joke of paying one down early is becoming just that.

If the ISA stuff is rubbish then you are saying any kind of investment in traditional financial instruments is rubbish. 
You may feel Britain is declining (is this your first recession?), choosing arbitrary periods to judge an index is silly, but even taking your example the tax free earnings from the FTSE since 2000 would a useful contribution. Of course you can invest globally and use other asset classes so just picking on UK equity seems silly too.

You also seem sure that prices will drop when QE ends. In other words you are sure shares will be sold at a discount in the near future, that sounds like a good reason for younger folk to buy (pound cost averaged naturally).

Why trade your investments for a property? Given the time horizons for equity investments, you would be better just saving saving cash (or perhaps not bothering with a mortgage)

Don't expect to live you father's life. Early retirement is possible (there is a huge online community trying to do just that), however it requires some massive sacrifices. Forget drinking, holidays, children, any participation in consumer culture and say hello to a 50% savings rate. 
Most of us cannot be bothered, but some of the lessons are worthwhile. However little you earn, you can be saving more and the sooner you start, the bigger the snowball gets.

The best example I can give is of myself. I've been a Leeds supporter from a young age, despite having no connections to the city or the club at all. I should be an Arsenal or a Spurs fan (Mum's family- Arsenal fans, Dad's Family - Spurs fans haha) or a Bournemouth fan (Nearest team). I'm not entirely sure what age I started to support them, but it was when I was first getting into football, which was around about the time they were in Europe and were on the TV quite a lot. The good old days of Radebe, Kelly, Harte, Kewell, Viduka, Smith and many more! But then shortly afterwards things went downhill. Even after things went downhill, I kept supporting them and if anything it made me support them even more. As i'm not a member, so I can't buy away tickets.  I've only ever seen them live once, when they were away at Portsmouth, because I just went to the stadium and asked if they had any tickets in the away end. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it's a rare occurrence but I just got lucky that day!! Not that lucky, it was 0-0 and Colin Wanker's first match in charge. (Although I'll probably try the same tactic when Leeds are away at Bournemouth in March) 

 Basically what you need to know about the money thing is, Peter Ridsdale (chairman at the time) risked a ridiculous amount of money on a gamble that Leeds would make the champions league, and then pissed off before he could be held accountable. Needless to say, not a good situation to be in. And two relegations in three years left Leeds in League one, with -15 points. The reason behind it was all to do with the financial situation, and because Leeds had gone into administration right at the end of the season, and were bought out by Ken Bates before the new season, (inline with FA rules) but because HMRC challenged this, Bates had to change his offer, which missed the deadline set by the FA, and so Leeds weren't allowed to start the new season, but the FA ruled that Leeds were allowed to start but with a 15 point deduction.  

TL;DR Start watching games, following the side! Never give up on them no matter how low they go (not that they'll be going back to League one anytime soon. Touch wood)

true,HenrysRightFoot,null,null,"|""First of all, fuck you for implying I'm being stupid.""

At this point you have already taken things further than it needed or had to go.  I don't think you are stupid. Seeing how you handle internet posts doesn't help your cause though.

|""You think Cazorla is worth more than £25 million?""

Read the thread before you speak.  It was asking what we thought the number was that Arsenal couldn't refuse to sell for even if we weren't inclined to i.e. ridiculous fucking offers so ""more than $25 million"" falls under that category nicely. For instance, if Arsenal, Real Madrid or Bayern etc. had rolled up this summer to Anfield's office with a 60m pound check there is a good chance that Liverpool would have accepted and that would be considered ""an offer they couldn't refuse"". The thread focused around the Ramsey to Barcelona 50m transfer rumor which is, not coincidentally, a ridiculous rumor. Great detective work Barney Fife. 

|""Fucking lol. ""Probably."" Name ten players that are better. No, name five, not including Ronaldo or Messi.""

The reason I said top 10 is not because I don't think he is a top class player but because comparing across leagues and positions is a difficult task and it is hard to say what order shakes out after the top 2. Its pretty hard to compare for instance Pique to Suarez.  So I would say that top 10 is pretty fair.  Shit, If you want top 3 goal scoring forwards right now discounting Messi and Ronaldo, without a doubt he is in there currently.
 
|""And what I'm saying is in the form he is in now, I'd pick Suarez over Messi.""

On current form it is even hard for me to disagree with you about trading him. Especially given Messi is injured, which I guess would be his current form by your measure? Also, on form alone I wouldn't trade Ramsey for Suarez, so going off form makes no fucking sense unless you mention you are doing so. 

| ""Suarez works harder."" 

Nothing there indicates form to me. However, if you are asking me if I would trade Ramsey for Suarez on any given day with not just form in consideration of course I would.  That would be ""**an offer I couldn't refuse**"" 

| ""You're clearly still bitter he didn't join you in the summer.""

I could just write ""no I'm not"" for this or even just ""table says I don't give two shits"" because both describe how I feel about that comment, but I'll play along. For me, he is just another player albeit a very, very talented one. Nevertheless, I couldn't care less about the fact he didn't join us. If I was bitter (I'm not) it would be with Liverpool, not Suarez because he seemed not too upset, maybe even rather happy about us bidding on him. A bit like Andy Dufresne the first time that prison wall showed a sign of weakness (Suarez is innocent of his crimes too isn't he. AHA!). Arsenal made the decision not to take him. We could afford to pay whatever you were asking for him if we had really wanted to. I'm not sure if he truly wanted to join us or not but he definitely wanted to leave Liverpool so don't even act like he chose not to go. The only reason he is wearing your shirt is because the right offer didn't come in. We are where we are and things are working out just fine for us so far and I don't really have any complaints about it.  

|""If he was wearing an Arsenal shirt you'd be saying otherwise""

Wrong, couldn't be more wrong.  I would shove him out the door even if he begged me to stay. Pick any player on Arsenal. Hell, I may even let you pick two if you put a gun to my head. I'll trade them both for Messi and I don't give a rats ass who it is. Messi is the kind of talent where even if you don't need him you take him. If he comes available, for a decent price, you don't say no.

On a side note and this is not meant to be a slight or anything.  Enjoy the time you have left with Suarez.  He is a world class player and it going to suck if/when he leaves. RvP and Fabregas were my two favorite Arsenal players growing up and were a joy to watch.  They weren't quite as racist and couldn't bite quite as hard though (kidding, just trying to wind you up).

The real numbers are not really vectors pointing from the zero element. They are a totally ordered set - they can be placed in a strict order and you can always determine what number is the largest in a given collection of them. This is *not* the case for general vector spaces over reals unless you define an order relation that is different to the usual one. Perhaps one where the (2d in this case) vectors (a,b) &lt;= (c,d) if and only if a &lt; c  or b &lt;= d if a=c. If you just try something like this when using the norm of the vector (it's length) then you will quickly find you can't create such relations to order vectors (think all vectors that lie on a circle - all have the same length). When you are invoking the absolute value in your example you are using the norm on the reals to define a order relation. This doesn't work.

I don't even think a fundamental change to the organisation of the sport would help; even if you included a half-hour 'grevience airing' slot during half time (say) it would still be in the best interest of individuals to disrupt the game too.

But I don't think I can argue any further than that; its not completely clear to me why I should feel entitled to watch sporting events when there is still demonstrably stuff wrong with the world (or even the weaker argument; stuff wrong with the world which I could personally put right for the same amount of money / investment of time as I spent attending any given event).

true,kevio17,,Alex Mowatt is just a good Tom Cleverley,"**A quick history** 

* Formed in 1919 after Leeds City FC were dissolved after making illegal payments to footballers during WWI.
* Most successful period was in the late 60s/early 70s, winning the league twice in that period, runners up 5 times, won the FA Cup, League Cup and should have won what is now the Champions League but lost out due to a dodgy linesman (1975).
* Then-manager and club legend Don Revie changed the Leeds colours from yellow and blue to all-white to emulate Real Madrid (20-odd-times Spanish champions at the time).
* Also won the league the year before it became the Premiership (1991/92), the season after getting promoted
* More recently, made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League but spent a **lot** of money in the process, had to sell sell sell as a result, got relegated (twice) and went into administration (twice). 
* Started 2007/8 at the bottom of League One (third tier) with -15 points due to aforementioned admin, ended this season and the following losing in the playoffs before winning promotion as runners-up.
* Currently nicely established in the Championship (second tier) for the third season in a row, under Brian McDermott who won promotion with Reading two seasons ago .

**Some bits to get you up to speed**

Current notable players:

* Rodolph Austin, captain. Tough tackling and strong centre midfielder who can also power forward and set up a few goals. Passing can be either awful or immense depending on his day but has become 'the Beast' down to his combative play style. Will shoot from like 30 yards out with a shot that will take your head off at least once a game (and probably not score from it).

* Ross McCormack. Scottish international and current top scorer - his best goalscoring season was two years ago (19 goals) but is already on 16 this season. Creative, tricky and scores all kinds of goals - instinctive tap-ins, curls from the edge of the box, free kicks. Notches a fair few assists too and while he does have barren patches, they mostly come when he's not playing up front.

* Sam Byram, young English right back who was thrown into the first team (about the only thing previous manager Neil Warnock got right). Currently the highlight of the current crop of Leeds youngsters, quiet and gets on with it but one of the most creative players we've had in years and most people will tell you he should be playing on the right wing (I disagree). Such a talent that at one stage last season, El-Hadji Diouf said he would only look for Byram when passing, as he was the only player Diouf thought could do anything with the ball.

Recent names you'll probably hear a lot of:

* Robert Snodgrass, Jonny Howson, Bradley Johnson, Luciano Becchio: three talented lads who were with us since League One, plus Bradley Johnson. All left for Norwich over the last couple of years, so it's become a (now tiresome) running joke that any talented youngster we come out with will end up being sold to Norwich. Becchio was exchanged for Steve Morison in what I deem as the Most Pointless Transfer Of All Time^^TM - Becchio can't get a game at Norwich (he entered the top 10 Leeds goalscorers of all time not long before he left) and Morison was loaned back to his old club Millwall after a few months.

* Max Gradel - top, top (top) Ivorian winger who was sold to St Etienne two years ago. Very quick, very tricky and banged in 18 goals in our first season back in the Championship (Becchio got 20). Was sent off after about half an hour during the promotion-winning game in 2010 but we won so he was forgiven. Like Becchio, will probably be linked to a move back to Leeds during the upcoming transfer window but that probably won't happen.

* Alex Mowatt, Chris Dawson, Dominic Poleon - three of the club's most recent academy graduates, all in and around the first team at different stages of the past year or so. Mowatt's a creative central midfielder who has started the last 10 or so games and has established himself in the starting lineup. Dawson made a couple of appearances toward the end of last season, while Poleon has been in and out of the lineup since the start of last season, starting the odd game and scoring the odd goal, now a regular fixture on the subs bench.

* Salah Nooruddin, Salem Patel, David Haigh - decent enough chaps with a bit of a PR team behind them, but ultimately, all part of the lineup that owns the club. Nooruddin is the chairman and minority shareholder, while Patel and Haigh (commonly known as Big Dave, Beeston Dave, Big Beeston Dave or the Haighmaker (I made that one up but I think it should stick)) are part of GFH Capital who ultimately own the club. It's complicated, and they are mostly here to help us find investment, but they've made a lot of positive changes around the club and seem like generally all-round nice blokes.

^^^woo, ^^^all ^^^that ^^^and ^^^not ^^^one ^^^mention ^^^of ^^^Ken ^^^Bates ^^^&lt;3

And as suggested:

* Historic rivals - the likes of Man United and Chelsea will always be put into this category. Reasons why could go beyond the text limit of this post, but Man United (*never* just 'United') are the big ones, and both have their own Wikipedia articles ([Man Utd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry), [Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.%E2%80%93Leeds_United_A.F.C._rivalry)). [This is up there with the highlights of our recent history, we were in League One at the time (and won btw)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpnrxCXZJ4), and we also [beat Chelsea 1-0 in a match that lasted 45 minutes last season.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20690782). 

* Geographic rivals - most of these have developed over the last 10 years or so in our period outside the top flight, but recently, matches v Huddersfield, Middlesborough and (not-so-geographically) Millwall have taken on a larger significance (to the away fans at least). The Millwall one probably stems from a) two very, very passionate sets of fans and b) Millwall beating us in the League One playoffs a few years ago.

* Leeds salute - fist bump your chest a few times, [as wonderfully demonstrated by our captain the other week.](http://i.imgflip.com/4l16b.gif) Not too sure about the history of this one, maybe one of the folk who've been around longer than me (or in the Leeds area - I'm a southerner) can help out here.",0,1386582064,null,0,1386596971,0,cdxbchf,t3_1sg8jl,t1_cdxbchf,t3_1sg8jl,null,1428329141,22,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,22
