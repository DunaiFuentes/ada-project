true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't misunderstand the process. If you use all of the water on Earth, then even if you discard the water that contains the single molecule of active ingredient, that molecule then still exists in the sum total of the water on Earth, which is a quantity smaller than that of the proposed sphere.

EDIT: Adding the quantitative argument here because I seem to have struggled to explain it otherwise.

Let's say you have 1ml of the active ingredient dispersed throughout all of the water on Earth. That is of course unrealistically low. But still, assuming a relatively large molecule of molecular weight 1kg/mol, that still gives you an average of 10 molecules in every single litre. Such a concentration is far below that which can be measured with current instruments - let alone separated out. No matter how much you dilute your homeopathic medicine, the background concentration will still be higher than 1 molecule per *1AU sphere*.

A sphere of radius 1AU has approximately a 10^18 times the volume of all of the water on earth. So a concentration so small that such a sphere would contain only one molecule (i.e. a concentration so small that *the entire world* would have a one in a billion billion chance of containing such a molecule) is absolutely absurd.

EDIT 2: Ok, so on the dilution stuff. Some people have objected to my reasoning based on the idea that active ingredient concentrations that were not part of the original solution are not considered 'active'. Of course chemically they're identical, but we'll go with this. Copying some of my numbers from another post.

10C solution has a concentration of 10^-20, and 30C solution has a concentration of 10^-60. A sphere of water of radius 1AU has of the order 10^39 litres of water in it, and a single mole of solution has order 10^23 molecules. Assuming a molecular weight of 1kg/mol and a density the same as water (reasonable to within an order of magnitude) that gives us 10^19 litres (i.e. 10^42 molecules) of solution in the sphere at 10C, and 10^-21 litres (i.e. 10^2 molecules) of solution in the sphere at 30C. So clearly the claim that the sphere would have a 50% likelihood of containing a single molecule at 10C is totally unreasonable (it actually contains an amount of the solution that's about 1/100 of the volume of all water on Earth).",0,1359049016,null,0,1359052159,0,c82tr1e,t3_176u8m,t1_c82tr1e,t1_c82tnqs,null,1435639100,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

They can be extremely heavily regulated, but as long as they are legally available to the public, they are still a danger. You're always risking a criminal stealing one, or someone snapping and going on a shooting spree (even trillions being spent on mental health care wouldn't totally stop this). You still haven't said why these weapons are needed by civilians at all, even if they are heavily regulated.

true,wrigley2345,eng-dorset,Dorset (Living in USA),"I don't think that the consensus that 'Something has to be done' is as universally spread as some people think. I think a lot of people, including myself believe there is very little reasonable legislature for firearms that could have been passed to stop the Sandy Hook tragedy. I think the main issue is mental health, as you will see the majority of people who have done these shootings are drugged up on their skulls on Meds for personality disorders. The assault weapon ban will not change anything. They only define what an assault rifle is by what it looks like, not how it operates. And having a magazine limit is pointless - People wil just buy more magazines and reload more. I suggest you scroll through [this short presentation](http://www.assaultweapon.info) to bring your knowledge up to date with past AWB's.

The NRA's statement after Sandy Hook frustrated me. Personally, I agree that if there were armed guards in schools that have had shootings, they would have been stopped quickly minimizing deaths, while also acting as a deterrent in the first place. As you may know, schools in the US are some of the few 'Gun Free Zones', and if you think about it it's a perfect place for a crazy guy with a gun to release some stress - Until the cops arrive, no-one can stop him. There is an underreported incident that happened in 1997, where a guy came into his school with a rifle and killed two people. He ran to his car to drive over to the middle school (Primary School) to kill more, but was stopped by a teacher who ran to his truck to retrieve his revolver. [Here's the Wiki article about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_High_School_shooting)
If you think about it, if the guy was allowed to have his gun in school and didn't have to run back to his truck, 2 lives may have been saved.  
[Here's a link](http://rense.com/general95/sch-shootings-stopped.html) to several other mass shootings that have been stopped my armed civilans if you are interested

But the issue for me, is that having armed teachers, or armed security guards walking around in schools just wouldn't work. The main issue is just how easy it would be, for say one of them to leave it lying around in a bathroom for a kid to stumble on it and have a little try. Even if people were secure with their firearms, kids could easily gang up on them and forcibly take the weapon. So while the fact that 'Having armed people in schools will stop shootings' is probably correct, the method they proposed to go about it would not work. 
Personally, I think there should be two gun safes in schools, one at either end of the building. 2 or 3 people have access to these safes, so when a shooting does happen they can quickly respond without having to worry about guns moving freely about the school on a day to day basis.",0,1359049340,null,0,false,0,c82tuvr,t3_176jug,t1_c82tuvr,t1_c82t9d7,null,1431065963,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;You have absolutely no information about my ailment other than what I have told you on reddit, yet 'on balance' you seem to know more about it than I do. Science.

Yes, on the balance of what I *do* know, what you've said, I think it more likely that you responded to a placebo than to an active compound.

&gt;I claimed they did work - for a time, until my body built resistance to the medicine, at which point I would switch pills, and receive (something close to) the desired effect again.

Ok fair enough. That's a shame that nothing worked they prescribed you worked in the long term.

&gt;It's almost as if they had a method that was different to yours, yet was still effective and phenomenally valid. Weird.

Except it's not very effective.

&gt;You originally said ""but western medicine can purify those, improve them, make them safer, and cheaper."" This is incorrect. Western medicine can purify, improve (perhaps), make them safer (perhaps) - but it has absolutely nothing to do with making them cheaper. Medicine is a different field to economics.

That's not true all. You see sometimes chemists discover compounds which are pharmacologically effective, but which we are not yet capable of synthesising. Sometimes these compounds are very expensive to grow or produce, we might need to grow trees, or harvest sea cucumbers from the bottom of the ocean just to get a few mg of the active ingredient. What chemists try to do (and often succeed at) is alter the structure to something we *can* synthesise, which has the same or comparable medical effects, but costs maybe a tenth or even 1/100th of the price to produce a final product from.

&gt;Drugs of suspect effects are released to the buyers market regularly.

Can you be more specific by what you mean here? You mean they have side effects you don't approve of, or what?

&gt;My friend got a prescription for a pain she had been having in her toe - the pills turned out to be (among other things) anti-depressants.

Without knowing more about the case and drug I don't want to comment too much, but that sounds like a possible problem with her doctor, I don't see what fault that is of the drug though.

&gt;Brain chemical altering pills - because her toe hurts?

Well, many chemicals alter the brain, hell chocolate alters the brain. As I said though, without knowing the case and the drug I'm not going to comment further.

&gt;Let's not forget that modern western medicine took a giant leap forwards during WWII, when the most intensive and accurate scientific experiments were completed. The scientific process could be put into 'all-systems-go' due to the incredible number of spare Jews that were lying around - perfect subjects to push science forward. This is of course not to say these experiments were bad - scientifically they allowed for one of the greatest scientific leaps in history - the results were excellent - shame about the Jews.

Ah, so you wish to invoke Godwins law eh?

&gt;Scientists know what's going on"" is a perfect example of why people in that field are potentially very dangerous - nobody knows, not for certain. Also, Thalidomide anyone?

Yes. Side effects happen. That's why we have phased clinical trials and Phase 4 is a post-release phase where side effects are monitored and dealt with where they arise.

I'm going to take issue with what seems to be your definition of ""knows"".

We *know* that we've tested a drug on x number of people and that it has or hasn't caused y side effects. We *know* that there's a risk that any drug, once released to the general population, may show side effects which have not yet been seen. We *know* that we'll monitor the situation and keep track of what side effects arise and work on dealing with any that do.

Most importantly we *know* what we know, and we know the types of things which might occur.

&gt;OK, OK, so stuff has changed since then, we learnt our lessons, and NOW... NOW we have a perfect system. Infallible. NOW we know everything. NOW we're perfect. Right?

See my above. I never said the clinical trial system is infallible, I'm just stating something which is true, we set out to run strict medical trials, we do so, and then we monitor a drug afterwards.

For someone who is advocating a system of medicine in which zero clinical testing is done whatsoever, you seem very hostile to an industry which carries out about 7-10 years of intense clinical testing per drug.

&gt;I must be a fusty old bigot if I don't agree with you. if I simply do not believe that it was placebo, then you are instantly more intelligent than me.

I never said that. I never said you had to believe it's a placebo, I just think it was. You demonstrate an aversion to acceptance of this fact which I think extends beyond your demonstrable belief in herbalism. I could be wrong, but given that this is the internet I'll never know.

&gt;Child please.

If you think by invoking the fact that you're (possibly) a few years older than me aids your cause in any way, you're wrong. Age is as irrelevant to argument as anecdotal experience is to scientific debate.

In your case, the fact that you're old and had a single good experience with a herbalist are indeed both irrelevant.",0,1359049448,null,0,1359049695,0,c82tw3v,t3_176u8m,t1_c82tw3v,t1_c82tklk,null,1431065988,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

I don't believe this at all. The way society views mental health here is insane. Nobody wants to seek treatment because they'll be viewed as inferior to their peers, and the mentality here is that if you have mental health issues, you are less of a person. 

Kids with mental health issues get bullied like crazy at schools, and teachers do very little to stop bullying out of fear of retaliation from the parents. There is that problem, or the kids will go home after being bullied all day, and their parents will either not be there because they are working three jobs to get by, or the parents won't give a shit. So they obtain weapons and murder people because that is their way of getting back at society. It also doesn't help that every time there is a mass shooting, the shooter becomes an anti-hero on TV. To the mentally unstable, this is their time to shine. 

I don't believe regular citizens should need fully automatic weapons. My problem is with the broad term given to assault weapons. Another fact is that Columbine happened during the previous assault weapon ban in the United States that was nationwide. The point of legislation is to stop murder sprees like Columbine, but it didn't stop it.

You take a small amount of your ""active"" ingredient and dilute it, say, 100 times.

Your solution is 1% active ingredient at this stage, yes? 

Homeopaths would describe this as ""1C"" dilution. But they don't use 1C dilution - they carry on going thus:

Of this solution, you take 1% of this and dilute that 100 times. The other 99% of your previous solution you throw away. At this stage, you have 1% of 1% of your original active ingredient - or 0.001%. This is ""2C"". Which again, isn't used.

Of this solution, you now take 1% - again, throwing the rest away - and dilute **that** 100 times. You now have 1% of 1% of 1%. Or 0.00001% active ingredient. ""3C"".

Lather, rinse and repeat. By the time you hit 30C (a common dilution for homeopathic remedy), you have 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% active ingredient.

If a Yank might add a point?

Every time I travel in the UK I am forcefully struck by two facts: ""There are a hell of a lot of people here, and they've been here a hell of a long time."" The simple difference in population density brings about some significant differences in attitude, but it's a hard element to isolate, and therefore often overlooked.

To give an example, the place where I grew up (not even large enough to be called a village or a town) was located in a rural part of a rural state. I don't ever remember seeing a police officer there, unless they'd been called and were investigating a crime that had already been committed. My British friends have a hard time comprehending that, but it's true. Poor areas with limited resources, and a small population spread over a large area, means police protection is, for all practical purposes, non-existent.

We knew where the police stations were, of course, but even at top speed their response time would have been in the range of 30 minutes. Things have improved in some areas since then, but with budget cuts and debt problems among smaller municipalities, staffs have been cut and things have gotten worse.

We grew up with firearms because we hunted, and because if there was trouble, we had to handle it on our own. Expecting someone else to handle your self-defense would have been seen as a moral failing tantamount to paying someone else to change the oil in your car or mow your grass. I don't live in quite-so rural an area anymore, but I'll freely admit that attitude of self-suffiency is still an important part of my character, and I think a lot of Americans draw from a similar background.

Whenever gun control discussions come up, the bit about resisting tyrants and oppression get a lot of attention, but that's honestly just because the loudest and most obnoxious of us love talking about that stuff. They think that by aligning themselves with a big important cause, they become big and important by association. But in order to understand why Americans *as a whole* generally oppose gun control, you have to understand that the capacity for self-defense and self-sufficiency is something we see as an integral part of our character.",0,1359052186,null,0,false,0,c82ut7w,t3_176jug,t1_c82ut7w,t1_c82p4y2,null,1431066437,277,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,277

 You're tenacious, I'll give you that.  Thanks for your nearly professional opinion.

 &gt;Except it's not very effective.

 That's sort of what we're talking about.  It's interesting to see you decide upon an answer and work towards it.

 &gt;Well, many chemicals alter the brain, hell chocolate alters the brain. As I said though, without knowing the case and the drug I'm not going to comment further.

 True, true.  Brain-chemical altering was certainly too vague.  For the purposes of this, I'll drop it, but it will continue to have a lasting effect on how I perceive prescribed ""one size fits all"" pills.

 &gt;Ah, so you wish to invoke Godwins law eh?

 We could side-step Godwin and talk about the Japanese - another time probably. 

 &gt;Most importantly we know what we know, and we know the types of things which might occur.

 Well that's great.  I think it is immeasurably important to *know* that you don't *know* everything.  I think actually, that it is absolutely vital - and it is a quality that is absolutely not seen is the following people;  medical scientists and popes.

 &gt;For someone who is advocating a system of medicine in which zero clinical testing is done whatsoever, you seem very hostile to an industry which carries out about 7-10 years of intense clinical testing per drug.

 My hostility comes across as much stronger than it actually is in reality.  The reason I put such effort into it occasionally on places like reddit, is because without someone saying these things - everyone seems to just freefall into agreeing with whoever talks the most like a textbook (safe, secure, sweet self-validating knowledge), and everybody joyously degrades whatever the thing is that is in opposition to the ever loved and ever praised ""Science"".  Also, I think it is important to recognise that as we have already established, (historically speaking) the fact that there is near zero clinical testing does not make something invalid... as you said yourself - it's quite surprising what was achieved without the modern medical scientific rigor.  in fact, after you put the numbers of it down... it is actually quite astonishing.    

 &gt;I never said that. I never said you had to believe it's a placebo, I just think it was. You demonstrate an aversion to acceptance of this fact which I think extends beyond your demonstrable belief in herbalism. I could be wrong, but given that this is the internet I'll never know.

 Again.  It will be appearing more forceful than my genuine feeling of the situation.  The reason I keep mentioning it - is because you keep insisting that it was a placebo.  I could turn the tables and mention the number of times you have mentioned that the treatment I received was a placebo; it shows a fanatic attitude about your belief on the situation.  You simply don't seem to be able to let it lie that someone with a background in TCM cured me of an ailment, where modern western medical science could not.  I was in fact cured *the very day* of my appointment.  I never once suffered again (providing I remembered to take the medicine) - where western medical science tried numerous products, over a period of years, and in the end simply was not even close to being as effective as this personalised recipe given to me.  For the very first time, I was treated like I had *my own* body, that had it's own sensitivities and nuances, and was treated as an individual, rather than plied with industrially manufactured ""one-size-fits-all"" pills.  

 &gt;If you think by invoking the fact that you're (possibly) a few years older than me aids your cause in any way, you're wrong. Age is as irrelevant to argument as anecdotal experience is to scientific debate.

 My experiences are anecdotal to you - but not to me.  I have the privilege of authentically knowing what happened, and how.  It is anecdotal to you, but not to me, and therefore it is not inherently anecdotal.  The rhetoric that I hear from people arguing your side of the fence is the same every time.  

 &gt;In your case, the fact that you're old and had a single good experience with a herbalist are indeed **both irrelevant**.

 How scientific of you.  So glad the future lies in your hands - with your supple mind, willing to take on new ideas, and hear things that are inconvenient to the view in your textbooks.

&gt;I've seen a lot of arguments that UK has 3 times the violent crime rate than the US and is the most violent country in the EU. What does that statistic actually mean to you guys living in the country. Are you guys mugged that often? I still can't find a break down of the statistic itself.

That stat is not quite true. It depends on how violent crime is measured. If you measure UK violent crime using the same measure as the US uses it drops right down.

Keep in mind that Sandro's injury will probably have him sidelined until sept/oct next season and then we have to consider if he will be the old Sandro when he gets back (having experienced torn ligaments in my knee it can take a bit before you get to where you once were).  So if we can get a DM cheap who can perform it can give us cover through next season while Sandro recovers and Parker ages it may not be a bad idea.

* Zero width
* Zero physical presence in midfield
* Lack of tactical flexibility, we're too predictable. We essentially do the exact same thing every game and expect to win. Even the mighty Barcelona had this problem last year. But if we can impose our style of play on the opponent as effectively as they do, i won't be complaining.
* Our attacking trio is easily isolated from our defense and holding midfield players. We then resort to long passes and hopeful lobs. Which nevers works out.
* We're extremely easy to play counter attacking football against. Specially if they attack our wings.
* Our midfield is incapable of retaining possession, playing short passes and building up an attack slowly. They either get impatient after 2-3 passes and try to force a pass that isn't there, or get closed down and are forced to play a back pass.

I'm surprised you guys are surprised when we lose.

In my opinion, with the players that we have, 4-2-3-1 is not a system we can play. Specially now with Moses out. We have no control over the midfield in this system.

I would also like to add a smill distinction off of your point that Americans prefer their laws hard and fast, rather than relying on precedent.  The British, so far as I can gather from what you have said, view themselves as a people who have evolved from more brutal means of governance to a strong, moral people.  Americans lack that experience.  Our great moral victories come with violence (our revolution, the end of slavery as part of the civil war etc).  We have Martin Luther King, but his was a victory AGAINST the mainstream rather than for it.

I point it out to give another example of why Americans like our rules in hard writing.  American government was founded on the idea that the nature of centralized government was to shift towards tyrrany.  Men in power, as a group, would always seek more power.  We've never experienced it any other way (and it has worked that way for us.  The President and Congress have much more power than they did at the founding).  That's why we like it written in stone, and will defend some of those right past where it's ""reasonable.""  That's where you get people who are willing to experience another terrorist attack rather than let the government check their library records, or people who couldn't care less about gun death statistics.

And you're remarkably rude and hostile considering you're in a discussion with someone who means you no ill.

&gt;That's sort of what we're talking about. It's interesting to see you decide upon an answer and work towards it.

I think you're mistaking my personal opinion from research. I judge individual schools of alternative medicine based on peer reviewed evidential research done on their efficacy. Homeopathy has been shown to be no more effective than placebo. Herbalism is generally shown to not be better than placebo, but at times has demonstrated use of viable compounds.

&gt;it is actually quite astonishing.

It is, but we're still talking about a system stabbing blindly in the dark. It's done a lot of that and it's been quite lucky at finding things, but it's overwhelmingly still ineffective and prescribing things which don't work.

&gt;The reason I keep mentioning it - is because you keep insisting that it was a placebo.

No, I said that my opinion is that from what you've told me it was *probably* a placebo. I have at no point insisted that it absolutely was a placebo. I've just said I suspect based on what I know of herbalism that it is likely it was.

&gt;I could turn the tables and mention the number of times you have mentioned that the treatment I received was a placebo; it shows a fanatic attitude about your belief on the situation.

I don't know if you've purposely misread me, have poor english skills, or are have made an honest mistake, but as I said, I have not asserted that what you were given was definitely a placebo, just that I think it was most likely a placebo. I accept the possibility you were given a functioning non-placebo treatment.

&gt;You simply don't seem to be able to let it lie that someone with a background in TCM cured me of an ailment, where modern western medical science could not.

Again, see above. I accepted that point right back in my first post to you.

&gt;I was in fact cured the very day of my appointment.

That makes me even more dubious that what you received was anything other than a placebo.

&gt;For the very first time, I was treated like I had my own body, that had it's own sensitivities and nuances

That's a failure of bedside manner, not of the medicine industry.

&gt;rather than plied with industrially manufactured ""one-size-fits-all"" pills.

No-one who is involved in medicinal chemistry or pharmacology thinks that one-size-fits all applies. Every human body is different and each one reacts differently to medicine. This is the core reason for one of the biggest problems facing any drug's development (that is, side effects vary person by person).

&gt;My experiences are anecdotal to you - but not to me.

No, sorry, they're anecdotal. You don't get to decide that. The meaning of the term anecdotal is clear, especially in this context. Feel free to google it.

You can call your experiences whatever you please, but that doesn't stop them being anecdotal. You did not carry out peer reviewed research, you did not run systematised trials, you, an individual, swallowed something you probably don't even know the contents of, and now you're using that single experience to argue for the efficacy of an entire branch of alternative medicine. That could be a textbook example of anecdotal ""evidence"".

&gt;How scientific of you. So glad the future lies in your hands - with your supple mind, willing to take on new ideas, and hear things that are inconvenient to the view in your textbooks.

Ah the old ""YOU WONT ACCEPT MY ANECDOTE SO YOU'RE CLOSED MINDED"" argument eh?

Heard that one before too. You show me peer reviewed research that whatever you took was effective and I'll be happy to talk seriously about this.

A thousand anecdotes doesn't make evidence, it makes for some good stories. Evidence requires very high standards of rigour, and you saying ""Well it worked for me"" doesn't cut it, I'm afraid. I'm perfectly open to new ideas, it's quite sad if you can't see that, but I only accept evidence which is of a good standard.

But shrug, since you've pasted it into this thread, I may as well take a stab at that issue. Firstly, yes, thegreatnick clearly misremembered the claim as being about 10C dilution, when clearly it was about 30C dilution (since that's the dilution level at which the numbers work out here). I'm sure he apologises.

Re the numbers at 30C, you're claiming those as 2 orders of magnitude out. I'm not sure where you got 10^39 L from, but [google claims 1.4 x 10^37 L in a sphere of radius 1AU](https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=20&amp;q=%284%2F3%29+*+pi+*+AU%5E3+in+l&amp;oq=%284%2F3%29+*+pi+*+1AU%5E3+in+l), which would explain the discrepancy. 

Also: what thegreatnick said was ""a sphere of water from the Earth to the Sun"". That would be a sphere with *diameter* 1AU, so radius 1AU/2. [Google gives that sphere as being 1.7 x 10^36 L](https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=20&amp;q=%284%2F3%29+*+pi+*+%28AU%2F2%29%5E3+in+l).

(Also, for what it's worth, the [original source for the claim talks about](http://www.badscience.net/2009/11/all-bow-before-the-mighty-power-of-the-nocebo-effect/#more-1403) ""one molecule of the substance in a sphere of water whose diameter is roughly the distance from the earth to the sun"", so the bit about a 50% chance was apparently a misremembering by thegreatnick. That gives you a factor of 2).

This is the problem. We need to rebuild our central midfield. Lamps can still do a job now and again when called upon, but he is too old to be the fulcrum of the midfield anymore. Ramires was a beast against Arsenal, but is inconsistent. Romeu has a long-term injury, and Mikel is quite literally MIA.

Think about how strong our midfield was at its peak. 
From 2006-09 we could boast: **Ballack, Lampard, Makalele, Essien(pre-injuries), Deco, and Mikel** All capable of putting in a strong and dynamic performance at the heart of the midfield for 90+ min. 

Whereas now, by comparison, we only have **Lampard, Ramires, Mikel and Romeu** as players on the roster who are *truly* comfortable playing in the center of midfield. Two of which are unavailable for selection, and one of which is nearing the end of his career, and by all accounts wont be with the club next season. 

Rebuilding the midfield should be priority #1 over the summer, if the club doesn't sign a couple of high-quality centre mid's over the summer we will be in big trouble next season.

true,PersonPersona,null,null,"While I agree with your sentiment, I find your reasoning suspect and would like to add my own possible explanation for the UK and America differ so much when it comes to gun control.

First, the idea that armed rebellion in the UK is an unnecessary or alien concept seems suspect considereing there has been an armed insurgency in recent memory in the UK. ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland only officially ended in 1998 and if you want to include armed insurgencies of colonial states the amount of examples explodes as well. In contrast, America hasn't had an organized armed uprising since the Civil War.

I think the biggest point you have overlooked is that America was birthed out of an armed insurgency against Britain. Without the right of the populace to bear arms in a rebellion against the current government there would be no America. This is obviously reflected in the American Constitution, though the Second Amendment is actually highly influenced by a British document- the Bill of Rights of 1689. Once included in the American Constitution the right to bear arms becomes much harder amend than it would be in Britain because of differences in how American law is treated. 

In Britain, the Constitution basically is used to uphold the laws of Parliament. Historically, the biggest power struggle in British politics was between Parliament and the King. The British Constitution basically says in all matters Parliament is the final say. However, in America our version of Parliament (Congress) is subservient to the Constitution, and not the other way around largely because we never had to deal with a monarchy.

This is getting sort of long so I'll wrap it up. I don't think there is a fundamental lack of people not having a sense of what it means to be American. I think there is a strong idea of what it means to be an American and that the principles of Americanism are embodied in the Constitution, a document which is much more resistant to change than anything found in British juriprudence.

The media says it and the public take it on-board from there. Note how Syria is not being sold s a ""jihad"" by our press because they want us to support it. Ditto Libya; over there the start of the rebellion was entirely driven by ""extremist"" groups. Our press decided not to talk about that. 

Good shout on bringing up Northern Ireland, that's a great example. On the surface it's religious with very clearly defined battle lines. But there is nothing about the religions in question that actually cause the tension. That is purely tribal, with each tribe having it's own view on the status of NI.

Take the recent flag riots. No sensible person would get angry about such a thing. Yet in NI it's seen as an insult to their tribe. It could be argued that they are insulted that they aren't able to ""insult"" those in the opposite tribe by proudly flying the flag. There's very much a ""fuck you"" attitude between the tribes, even during times of peace they insist on marching through each other areas. 

If a foreign press agency were to cover NI like we cover some conflicts foreign to us, they'd be labelling both sides as ""Christian Extremists"". This would not be a fair description of the problem, they are ""extremists"" but it's not motivated by religion. They just want their group to be the dominent power. This is exactly what's happening in Mali, groups that just last year were fighting for independence of the north of the country are now fighting each other over the spoils. Another thing our press conveniently omits is that Mali just had a military coup; the people we are fighting alongside are not a legitimate government.

true,Bloop2012,null,null,"I agree with both Sharper_PMP and Ken_Thomas. I grew up in rural Iowa, where police departments were one person, or just an element of the state police being on call. State police were often 20 minutes or longer for response time, and the local cop was a person many times off shift when trouble was brewing.

When you lived outside of town (If you can call a small church, convenience store, and bar/diner a town) then having a gun on your property was seen as almost essential. There was no screaming for help, and nothing scared off a group of teens with theft or vandalism on their minds than a harmless shotgun blast in the air. If this was all it was used for then I would be all for gun control as well. However, I've known my fair share of the criminal element too (we won't get into my upbringing and poor choices of my parents) and I know that when calculating the risk/reward of a burglary or home invasion, a lot of thought is put into which places might be armed and who knows how to use those firearms effectively. Just the presence of a gun can be a deterrent to some crimes.

Constitutional questions aside, we have hunters that provide food for their families via these firearms, we have families that rely on the firearms for self defense, and in many of these families one of the traditions of our young nation is the passing of firearms from one generation to the next. Heirloom weapons that previous generations used to hunt, or wielded in one of the United States armed conflicts.

The laws to make larger magazines and certain ammunition illegal is similarly a moot point in my mind. The USA-Mexico border is nowhere near secure. Drugs, weapons, and illegal immigration are all big business on our southern borders. Making the magazines, guns, or ammunition illegal will not remove the guns from the hands of criminals but rather take them out of the hands or law abiding citizens with a hobbiest or self defense motivation for owning the weapons.

A person who wants an AR-15 with a high capacity clip will just buy one off the black market instead of obtaining it legally. There will still be bank robbers who will go in with assault weapons and armor piercing rounds, police will still walk into situations where they are outgunned.

In the UK, while there is a much longer history and more precedent there is also another fact that helps ensure your gun control laws are more successful. By virtue of being an island, it is much harder to get illegal weapons into the country through the limited number of ports of entry. With a large, and largely unmanned, overland border then the enforcement of those laws becomes much more difficult.

This isn't even my point. My point is that years of tradition and a nation's history of civil order and freedom plays little role in that nations ability or willingness to abridge the rights of its citizens. The UK jumped into the war just like the US, the UK employs brutal police tactics to suppress unpalatable civil discourse just like the US, the UK does some pretty bizarre things and in many ways leans towards being a surveillance state, same as the US. Brits tortured civilians during the war, same as the US, and clearly didn't stop at 4:00 for a cup of tea to discuss how Brits ""... just... just don't do that!"" beforehand. 

Gun restrictions in the UK don't work better because ""history"" and implementing gun control in the UK isn't easier than in the US because ""history"".

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; *your country apparently supports CCTV surveillance camera networks, kettling non-violent forms of protests, and other crazy infringements of civil liberties*. None of your history and tradition stopped any of that

There are two sides to this point, though.

First off, nothing in my comment was intended to elevate the British approach over the US one, so I'm not sure why you see an opposition there that forces you to ""argue the side of the US approach"".

I was shooting for a value-neutral *description* of the contrasting approaches, without taking sides or approving of either one over the other.  Quite the opposite - I think both have a great deal to recommend them, especially to their respective nations.

If you're criticising the UK's civil liberties record *compared to America* then I think you're being unfairly partial - after all, we have kettling, but the USA has [free speech zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_speech_zone), which are arguably even worse.  Our government passes restrictive laws on free speech, while the US drone-bombs *even its own citizens* without trial, appeal or any semblance of due process.  The UK condones torture and renders individuals to foreign nations to be tortured, but the USA *actually does* torture its own and foreign individuals into death or insanity in black prisons that only exist due to legal loopholes in domestic and international law.  The UK has a comprehensive CCTV network (although the statistics usually quoted are wrong, because they fail to take into account the fact that the vast majority of CCTV cameras are privately owned and not available to the police without a request or warrant), while the USA routinely violated its more sacred privacy laws to eavesdrop on *every citizen in the country* for years, and even when it was revealed the individuals, agencies and corporations were pardoned and retroactively legalised instead of prosecuted.

My point here is not to paint the USA as the bad guy - merely to redress the balance from your previous comment, which seemed ridiculously biased against the UK's approach.  Realistically I think it's hard to draw much of a moral distinction between the two countries behaviour.  The USA was the nation aggressively pushing for many developments (like torture and foreign invasions), but the UK *chose to align itself* with America on its post-9/11 rampage across the world, and we didn't even have to excuse of a massive and shocking attack on home soil to galvanise us into xenophobic fury.  Who's more evil - the raging, out of control monster or the asshole who has a choice and still chooses to follow him?

Now, aside from the US/UK comparison, there's a *completely separate* issue of the steady infringement of civil liberties and freedom in the last decade or two, sharply accelerating since 9/11, and how the two systems have dealt with that influence.

I would argue that neither system comes out of this particularly smelling of roses - both the USA and UK committed horrifying acts against millions of blameless individuals, invading a blameless foreign country on trumped-up charges, passing all sorts of laws granting unprecedented powers to their respective governments and infringing on many and various freedoms and liberties of their citizens.

Which government recovers faster and restores more of their citizens' liberties is still an open question, but I think it's important to differentiate between the massive, decade-long, western-world-wide *absolute* upswing in paranoia and tensions and clamping down on civil liberties that's affecting *all* western governments to various degrees, and the *relative* comparisons of the UK and US approach to preserving citizens' rights against government intrusion.

**TL;DR:** Both the UK and the USA have had governments progressively infringing on civil and human rights over the last decade or two - the UK because we lack formal rules against it, and the USA by coming up with creative reinterpretations of or simply ignoring all the explicit, formalised rules it does have.

Neither one is demonstrably better, but it's very important when discussing issues like this to carefully differentiate between modern developments and external factors affecting both of them equally and the *relative* benefits or shortcomings of each.

**Still TL;DR:** The fact that Toyotas can't fly does not mean that they're worse than Cadillacs.",0,1359056572,null,0,1359057142,0,c82wcoz,t3_176jug,t1_c82wcoz,t1_c82v4gh,null,1431067197,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

It also said there was no link between high levels of gun crime and areas where there were still high levels of lawful gun possession.

Oh this is ugly. Let's take it in steps.

&gt;The research, commissioned by the Countryside Alliance's Campaign for Shooting

Gee, guv, I wonder what they wanted this survey to reveal!

&gt;The Centre for Defence Studies at Kings College in London, which carried out the research, said the number of crimes in which a handgun was reported increased from 2,648 in 1997/98 to 3,685 in 1999/2000.

This means nothing. For starters, stats do not magically turn around when a law is enacted. There is a time period of 'implementation'. Secondly, there is nothing to suggest that this is to do with the law being enacted - indeed, try and come up with a logical reason why it would link in.

&gt;It also said there was no link between high levels of gun crime and areas where there were still high levels of lawful gun possession.

This is the countryside alliance's show piece. High levels of lawful gun possession are most likely to be in rural areas.

&gt;""Policy makers have targeted the legitimate sporting and farming communities with ever-tighter laws but the research clearly demonstrates that it is illegal guns which are the real threat to public safety.""

Ding-ding-ding-ding. Who could have seen that coming.

The second half of it was supposed to go something like:

&gt; Conversely, while the USA has less of a *tradition* of genial reasonableness in its laws, it does a much better job of clearly enumerating and enunciating the limits placed upon its laws and elected officials, which reduces ambiguity and makes it harder to weasel around them or rely on [creeping normalcy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normalcy) to weaken long-standing protections and prohibitions against excessive governmental power.

Apologies for forgetting to include that, and I ca certainly see now why you might have thought I was being pro-UK as opposed to staunchly neutral.

I hate re-editing comments to change the sense of them after I post them (it feels a bit revisionist and dishonest), but if you don't mind I'll add that into my original comment, because it was only my own absent-mindedness that caused me to leave it out in the first place.

That said:

&gt; The 250+ years of American history have created that exact same sense of tradition that has become part of the moral fabric of the entire country.

With respect, if you're comparing the sense of tradition in the USA to the UK you have no idea what you're talking about.  Plenty of villages have *houses* older than your entire country, and a history and legal precedents stretching back over a thousand years.

I don't doubt that the USA *feels* as if it has a rich history of tradition if you have no frame of reference, but compared to most European countries, in terms of the cultural impact and effect on the psychology of people growing up immersed in it, it's like comparing a colonial brownstone house to a concrete skyscraper.

I don't say this to denigrate the USA - youth and innovation are also virtues, and traditions can be stultifying and regressive just as much as they can protect important resources.  However, to claim a young colonial nation like the USA has the same sense of unbroken tradition and history as an old-world country that's been where it is practically since we first developed the concept of ""nation"" is just daft.",0,1359057804,null,0,1359058345,0,c82wtfu,t3_176jug,t1_c82wtfu,t1_c82whq9,null,1431067440,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

One thing we have done is roll out Google Chrome to all computers.

As has been said Windows networks can be controlled by Active Directory and Group Policy. We need to ensure that pupils can't change the web proxy settings for example.

Chrome has been excellent for this, they provide an [MSI installer](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/browser/) and a set of [group policy templates](http://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-templates) so we can lock the settings down.

From an enterprise point of view, Firefox is next to useless. Despite users crying out for support they have refused to provide an MSI installer or group policy templates, and have even said that [enterprise users aren't a priority for them](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Firefox-update-politics-become-contentious-1268282.html).

Their [extended support release](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) model with ~12 months stability and guaranteed updates is too little, too late IMO. Schools in particular have been looking to move on from IE6 and IE7 for YEARS.

Comparing 'violent crime' stats in raw figures without considering the fact that the British Crime Survey record things as 'violent' crime which the US Uniform Crime Report does not is just silly. We have a much lower bar where virtually any form of sexual of physical assault is recorded as a violent crime, the US has two different counts, one of which only counts forcible rape and aggravated assaults, that is the most often quoted in the gun debates I've seen and its ludicrous, there are better surveys, based on victim reports of low to high level sexual and physical assault, (just like the BCS) which show much higher levels of violent crime. 

Oh and rates of knife crime, well yeah, we have stricter rules on knives, hence more reported crimes. We also count BB gun and air-gun injuries in our gun crime statistics and we count when sales of those and their bullets are done through the post (illegal) or when they are sold to anyone under 14 (also illegal here)  which the US DOES NOT DO on the federal level.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/leaguetables/9823396/School-league-tables-privately-educated-pupils-better-prepared-for-top-universities.html

&gt; For the first time, data shows how many teenagers are leaving schools and colleges in England with good A-levels in a range of core disciplines seen as a vital stepping stone to sought-after Russell Group institutions.
&gt;
&gt; It emerged that 150 out of the top 200 schools in the new table are from the fee-paying sector.
&gt;
&gt; St Paul’s Girls’ School in west London and Magdalen College School in Oxford saw 70 per cent of 18-year-olds reach the standard – the highest proportion in the country.
&gt;
&gt; At the same time, around a quarter of sixth-forms – almost all from the state sector – failed to produce a single pupil with good A-levels in a range of academic subjects such as maths, English, science and foreign languages.
&gt;
&gt; The results are likely to tighten private school pupils’ grip in places at leading universities such as Oxford, Cambridge and University College London which demand a string of top grades as a basic entry requirement.

DB depends on the scheme. The earlier you start the earlier you finish (retire)

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; That said, I stand by my statement that a thousand years of history hasn't really done much to prevent serious over-reach by parliament.

Ah, but this is another fundamental difference between the US and UK systems.

By writing everything down clearly and specifically, the USA seeks to prevent the passing of such laws, and this is often effective.  However, once they're passed it's often remarkably difficult to have them struck down - unless they can be challenged in the courts as unconstitutional it's often damn hard for public opinion to undo a bad law.

Conversely, while the UK public opinion is a much softer prohibition against passing bad laws (the government may still try to do so if it thinks it can push its luck or public opinion will tolerate it), it's also a very powerful force for *repealing* bad laws and precedents once they're passed.

For example, while the UK public consensus was much more against going into Iraq than the US public was and still couldn't stop the government from going in after the USA, the backlash of public opinion basically brought down the Prime Minister, *even though he hadn't exceeded his authority or done anything against the law*.

In the USA you have great prohibitions against bad laws and overreaching administrations, but once they happen there's comparatively little you can do about it short of an impeachment (which, IIRC, requires a criminal prosecution or similar).  Conversely, in the UK we have weaker prohibitions against bad laws or overreaching administrations, but once we get one public pressure can mount and mount until the law is repealed or the administration is forced to resign or step down.

In the case of the Iraq war Blair was basically forced out by his own party, because they were so terrified of the tsunami of public opinion building against his actions that it was honestly believed if they didn't dispose of him themselves then they'd lose the public's support for an entire generation.  Bush faced a lot more in the way of legal challenges to his worst excesses, but he also served out both terms and retired to a comfortable life of memoirs and speaking engagements.  Blair is still considered a pariah here in the UK, to the point that his appointment as a UN Middle East Peace Envoy was regarded by most Britons as a bad joke, and when his name was mooted for the EU Presidency there was such an explosion of disapproval from both the public and even governmental sources that the suggestion was swiftly dropped.

Again, I'm not advocating for one style over the other - they're beneficial in different ways.  The USA is certainly better at preventing bad laws ahead of time and striking them down on points of principle (and I think the UK could do with a lot more of that, starting with a written Constitution and Bill of Rights), but the UK tends to be a much more responsive government that's significantly [more scared of its own public](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8065-people-shouldn-t-be-afraid-of-their-government-governments-should-be), and that can more easily get rid of bad laws that a majority of citizens simply *morally disagree with* even if it has weaker prohibitions against such laws being passed in the first place (and in turn I think the US government could do with being a lot more responsive and generally scared of public opinion than it is now).",0,1359060298,null,0,1359060983,0,c82xrlt,t3_176jug,t1_c82xrlt,t1_c82x09e,null,1431067864,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I'm definitely against anyone and everyone being allowed access to firearms, and much prefer living in a country where few people have them than many, but I think you're using completely the wrong argument to back up this position; in fact I find what you've written somewhat absurd.

Your examples are very narrow, and it's quite easy to come up with a scenario that your theory falls apart on.  How about if an armed burglar comes into your house and you pick up your weapon in case they come into the same room as you.  Or if someone starts shooting at you from range and doesn't hit at first.  Also, ""self-defence"" quizzically often refers to defending others as well as oneself (see English common law self defence).  In this case, even if someone already has a weapon at someone's head, someone else could be in a position to defend the victim.

In fact, in general, both here and abroad, an armed British soldier (and I'd guess Police officer as well) has no further rights in use of their weapon than that offered by common law self defence, except when explicitly granted otherwise by the chain of command.

[Here](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/) is the CPS legal guidance on self defence.  Though it doesn't appear to explicitly mention lethal force, it doesn't exclude it either, and the same principles apply.  For example, the requirement for force to be reasonable would prevent someone legally in possession of a firearm from shooting someone who was giving someone else a few punches.",0,1359060962,null,0,false,0,c82y11r,t3_176jug,t1_c82y11r,t1_c82r75p,null,1431067990,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That wasn't an armed insurgency by the majority of the UK against the government, though - that was seen by the vast majority of the UK population as a small band of malcontents based in Northern Ireland and Eire, who insisted on NI rejoining with Eire in spite of the fact that a majority of people who lived there wanted no such thing.

The point is not that armed insurgence is unknown - it's that it's not seen as a realistic possibility by most of the UK population, and the Troubles in N. Ireland were seen as more a small bunch of terrorists and foreigners agitating in direct *opposition* to what most of the UK (including a majority of N. Irish people) actually wanted.

&gt; he biggest point you have overlooked is that America was birthed out of an armed insurgency against Britain. Without the right of the populace to bear arms in a rebellion against the current government there would be no America

That's another very good point, and I wish it had occurred to me to include it.  Excellent addition!

Don't get me wrong - I don't think that there's a lack of appreciation of what it means to be American either.

If that's the way you're going to go about it let's compare bananas to oranges next.  Secondly, in a country where the government, the citizens, and the police all know that officers of the law never show up on time for a crime, the citizens need to have a way to protect themselves for unforeseen dangers in their own homes.  Finally, the American criminal justice system is filled with mentally unstable individuals.  The prisons here are filled with at least 50% of someone who has a mental deficiency.  The recidivism rates are largely controlled by these citizens.  All the major shootings have all had two things in common are mental illness and guns.

The AR15 that everyone recognizes is actually not very powerful when ranked on a scale with traditional military small arms.  Any gun (even air rifles and the like) can be lethal.  The capacity of a magazine has a minimal effect given that magazines can be changed in seconds or less.  In the case of recent tragedies, the perpetrator changed magazines many times while the response of law enforcement was measured in minutes, well into portions of an hour or longer.   

Many of these regulations cover cosmetic or ergonomic features on certain firearms, not features that make them more accurate when ""shooting from the hip"" or ""spraying bullets.""  Since 1986, all new *assault rifles* have been restricted from manufacture and import.  These have been highly regulated since 1934, under the National Firearms Act.  The guns targeted by proposed regulation are cosmetically similar but functionally different.  Conversion of these to full automatic is not simple and carries significant penalties.

I do agree that access to secondary market and black market arms is an issue.  The means of regulating access is a treacherous path.  How do we ensure law abiding citizens are free to protect themselves and their families but at the same time keep those with ill intent from accessing these tools?  It's a tricky situation.

Upstairs is the lecture theatre where Davy and Faraday gave their lectures. And where the Christmas lectures, pioneered by Faraday in 1825, are still given.

Want to buy a gun, go to Firearms Safety School and graduate by showing a certain level of competence in terms of safety, marksmanship, and understanding of the laws surrounding gun ownership. Get a license to own a gun, then you can go to the gun shop and pick up the legal gun of your choice. I don't buy the ""I need a gun in a hurry"" response because if you have the time to seek a gun, you have the time to consult law enforcement about a remedy for the trouble. I also don't buy the ""Violation of privacy"" argument because we already have licenses, social security numbers, bank accounts, and utility accounts. There really isn't a move we make that a properly motivated law enforcement agency with probable cause would not be able to find out about.

I also agree about the NRA with their lobbying and fear mongering. I think that the lobbying rules for the legislature and executive branches are too lax. Personally I would love to see a banishment of lobbying because it's becoming more apparent that politicians are more interested in the spin and money for their next campaign then in doing what is genuinely right for the US Citizenry.

You **MUST NOT** leave a parked vehicle unattended with the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road. Generally, if the vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain so for more than a couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary in traffic or for diagnosing faults.

Perhaps this [map](http://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/main/images/US_Geography_800.jpg) would have been more appropriate, as it illustrates the influence of the Mississipi outside of the Midwest, note the 'intracoastal waterways' facilitated by the barrier islands of the Carribean allowing the East Coast to quite easily connect with the Midwest. 

The reason the United States is politically united despite its huge size is in no small part because of the Mississipi, which allowed the spread of American culture between 2/3 of your country (the rest was only really colonised after the railways). Being 'quite different' is not the extent of difference between European countries, and that's because of the Mississipi river. Belgium or Spain alone are more culturally diverse than the United States, despite the size disparity.

Just went through and added up all the minutes Lucas hasn't played from those, and it's about 180. He's started every match, but often been subbed around the 60 minute mark. 

So for 630 of the 810 minutes since Lucas returned from injury, he and Gerrard have been on the pitch together. I'd say that's a significant enough proportion.

I have ""semi-risky"" investments, so hopefully I'll be making a return of 7%+ but it's plausible I could lose everything (fortunately I'm so young it wouldn't cripple me, just sting a bit if I did)

For me there are 3 values with a pension:

1. It's tax free and has tax incentives from the government. If my employer pays me £100, I'll only see £60 of it. If I instead say ""put that £100 in my pension"" it'll be worth &gt;£100 (in my case ~£400)
2. Employer contributions are free money
3. There's no temptation to spend the money because it's impossible, it's so easy to say ""i'll just spend £500 this month and start saving next month..."" I never even see the money so I can't do that

The thing that convinced me to go with my pension and put as much as I could into it was realising just how much of a difference it makes starting early. If you take a look at some pension calculators and compare how much your pension will be worth if you start now vs. in 2 years, or 5 years or 10 years the difference is insane.

I'm assuming you're in your early 20s which means you're also in the same position I am: by the time we're nearing our 60s there probably won't be a state pension and so if we don't have a well funded private pension we're going to have to work until we die. For me there is a significant amount of value in knowing that my pension is protected from myself and is guaranteeing I get to retire.

Hell, in the UK you have to be 18 to buy any kind of knife (including kitchen knives) now, and there were people pushing to ban (that's ban, not regulate) long pointed kitchen knives.  That doesn't mean we can't do anything, but if you don't think the ""assault weapons"" ban isn't just the first step then I'm going to disagree with you.  When the ban keeps many semi automatic rifles legal and has no effect on crime (which it won't, semi automatic rifles account for less than 1% of murders), they'll go after all semi automatic rifles.  When that has little effect what's to stop them from going after all semi automatic handguns(already in several bills including the first draft of Feinstein's bill) which are just as deadly if not more deadly at close range.  Then we've lost 99% of the guns that are used for self defense and sports shooting, and many of the ones used for hunting.

In fact, we've seen the slippery slope before in the US, every time a law has passed it's become more restrictive on gun owners, never the other way around.  Last big bill was automatic weapons, now it's semi automatic.  The general consensus in the gun community right now is ""When all the compromises in the past have been one way, we've compromised enough""

tl:dr  If we don't fight for our ""assault weapons"" now then next time there's a high profile shooting it will be our pistols we'll be fighting for.  And if you think this bill will have any effect other than disarming law abiding citizens of guns they use for hunting, self defense, and sporting, then I invite you to read this before you respond.

The ones who should be called neo-confederates, and want their individual state / county to pass most legislation. They adopt libertarian rhetoric with the full intention of getting off the bus after the federal level. Incidentally the bus they want to get off at is usually the one that thinks people with funny-coloured skin shouldn't be allowed on the bus. [Seriously](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul188.html)


Then there are the crypto-ancaps. There are no real libertarians in America. A libertarian outside of the US (and in academic circles where the term hasn't been hijacked) means **trending** towards less government.

It has never been an outright rejection of it. They want lower taxes, flat taxes, fewer regulations, but still believe in taxation to some limited extent, for either a **reduced** or [Minarchist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism) government.

By contrast, most days you can't tell the difference between /r/libertarian and /r/Anarcho_Capitalism . The mises institute and other 'libertarian' fonts of knowledge online constantly talk about the virtues of private policing, fire services and **even justice**. 

Anytime you hear a US libertarian start spouting off about the government paving your roads 'from the barrel of a gun' just remember that political libertarianism in the US is effectively anarcho-capitalism. 

If you're interested in 'real' libertarianism the best book I can possible recommend, or if that's a bit much just an individual's writing to research online, is [Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy,_State,_and_Utopia)",0,1359068207,null,0,false,0,c830os5,t3_176jug,t1_c830os5,t1_c82ufdj,null,1431069261,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

As a person who has followed Suarez, and his respective teams, throughout his career I must say I would be very saddened if he left LFC. I've come to respect, love and even admire this club. I would be lying if I said the same about Ajax or Nacional (my hometown rival).

""No longer do people roll out of bed on a Saturday morning; they bound from it, knowing they are to be treated to a 90-minute exhibition from one of the world’s best. ""
   -I resonate strongly with this quote. At first, watching Suarez's first LFC games were tough; I watched a game in which a lost team seemed to take the field week after week. Now, I can't wait to watch, what I believe, is one of the more beautifully played games at the moment. 

I would be remiss to say that I'd happily follow Suarez to his next team. I began my LFC career as a strict supporter of Suarez and am now a fully fledged Red.

If we can continue our form like the 2nd half Man Utd game and carry that into those two games, we have a good chance to get 3 points from both games. If we atleast win one game and draw another, it puts us is a really good position to make a strong run for a top-4 finish.

It's a short term solution but it can have some terrible consequences down the line. 

Suppose you start sending the frequent fliers at your surgery to Homeopathy clinics. Whoever goes there because they go to the GP for attention (a small but non-trivial number of people) is going to get **a lot of attention**.

That's going to make them like homeopathy, or at least it's going to make a number of them like it. 

Which means if the patient ever does have something wrong with them they may well ask for homeopathy or other kook treatment because their GP has enabled them in thinking it does something. 

GPs are not bean counters, they try to treat a patient to the utmost of their (very) human ability. 

This is, incidentally, why it's a very damn good thing that GPs and other front-line NHS staff are shielded from making complicated funding decisions. Wearing two hats that conflict as much as maximum patient care and maximum value for money is not a smart thing to do. 


Edit: On reflection, I don't suppose anything what I've written above means GPs don't do what you've suggested. It all falls down to how jaded they are. My family are a mix of old and young doctors, but the older ones are in slightly more rural/suburban practices, and the younguns are no doubt still high on the experience of being a healer.

My own advice is just to play it off by highlighting the commonalities. Do you say bath, grass and glass properly (glAss, grAss, bAth, not glarse, grarse or barth?) Next time someone giggles at you remind them that 'you at least speak english properly' based on that. 

The North West has some of the most varied accents in the country, with the exception of Scotland, Wales and the North East. Villages a few miles apart have enough difference in their accents that people in one call tell where you're from. It's not a region that takes well to discriminating based on accent.

The self defence argument used to make me angry because the safety is an illusion, but these days it just makes me sad because that choice is selfish.  
I empathise completely with the human desire to be safe, but making it an individual's safety their own responsibility and not demanding that the government do so is just heartbreaking. I want *everyone* to be safe, not just me. Guns don't make everyone safer, they just make gun owners safer and leave the rest in relatively^((in the scientific sense of the word)^) more danger - people who are blind, physically handicapped, mentally handicapped, too old, too young, or too weak to use a gun, people who can't afford to own and maintain a gun or afford the investment in training to use it properly, people who choose pacifism and people who won't threaten another's life.... There are so many people who aren't protected by your opinion that ""The way to keep everyone safe is to allow everyone o arm themselves"".

It is absolutely a cultural thing and I think it reflects badly on yours.

You know I don't really have a problem with people teaching psychology or media studies at alevel. If they make the exam rigorous and hard to pass.

Schools that take shitty alevels do so to attract certain students and to make their performance look better. We have 80% ABC Alevel performance, but we'll be damned if we tell you what subjects they're in.

But then that isn't true. If you have anything other than the Telegraph (and I think the Mirror reported it without fact checking too), I would love to hear it, but because people keep quoting that article without context..

I just started ""Spearhead From Space"", the first of the Pertwee Doctor era, and interestingly enough the bad guys are Autons. Which ties nicely to 9, who's first episode was vs Autons, and 11, because Rory was an Auton for a while.

As far as I can tell, the only Doctor not represented on Netflix is 8.

The only advantage in watching the old episodes though is so that you can get the references that are peppered thoughout, such as ""Snow White and the Seven Keys to Doomsday"" from ""Night Terrors"".  Other than that it's just for history and entertainment.

However, knowing what kind of special effects were possible in the 60's, 70's and 80's (on American TV at least) makes the old effects look extra cheesy and can be distracting.  ""The Ark In Space"" had some kind of bug aliens, but the costume was very obviously made of bubble wrap painted green.

what happens is you use the lump sum that you've saved with your pension to buy an Annuity - this is a fund that gives you a payment every month, which is your pension. You can also take 25% of the amount as a lump sum on retirement.

https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/pension-calculator might  help - it shows you what you should put in based on when you want to retire etc.

for example, it shows that I could retire at at 55, and then get £185 a month (woo?)  to live on.
that's clearly not enough - retiring at 74 ups this to £683 a month

Those whom he imprisoned and tortured are the same ""extremists"" that we ourselves imprison and torture in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books &gt;that have tried to definitively link the two.[2]

Arsenal are currently 3 pts ahead of us with a +7 GD on us.
Everton are currently 4 pts ahead of us with a -3 GD on us
Spurs are currently 7 pts ahead of us with 0 GD on us.

Our fixture schedule reads Arsenal, Man City, West Brom
Arsenal reads Liverpool, Stoke, Sunderland
Everton reads West Brom, Villa, United
Tottenham have Norwich, West Brom, Newcastle.

As it stands, we have the toughest fixture list in the next 3 games. I would guestimate 4/9 pts for us(D-L-W). Arsenal would be able to pull off 7/9 points (D-W-W). Everton might also be able to pull out 6/9 pts (W-W-L), but this is extremely optimistic on their behalf. They might be able to pull off a draw against the Mancs, but I'm not gonna count for that. Tottenham have it extremely easy, and I'd be so bold to guess them taking 9/9 points, with them potentially stumbling on West Brom.

After that we'd see us with the following standings:

Arsenal - 44 pts

Everton - 44 pts

Liverpool - 38 pts.

1. No, it costs time and money to take pictures and write the details. If a property is on with more than one agent is it commonly photographed more than once.

2. No it's relatively unusual for agents to own properties, although some do (or rather the agency owner also own properties which they let through their companies). Landords would commonly pay 12% to 15% for managed, and 8% to 10% for unmanaged this info is a few years old though.

3. Don't know. Mine wouldn't have, but some may be happy to.

4. Seasonal. Big drop off in December, often busy in January. Slow in the early summer, rising gradually until September which is busy. Sometimes very quiet around easter. This may be regional though.

Small towns and villages aren't all they are cracked up to be; 40 minutes on a bus to the nearest town is fucking awful, 20minutes to walk to the only shop nearby isn't so bad until you realise there is pretty much nothing in the shop. 

But if you have a car then that's not so bad. The smell of shit every now and then but that's not bad, I was around 14 when I moved away from a village but almost no one talks to anyone, you'll say hello but nothing beyond that those who you do talk to you'll talk to a lot.

There is a general attitude of ""for fuck sake, fucking Americans"" if you catch my drift so don't be overly loud or overly pushy for conversation where it's not wanted.

In towns there are chavs which just act like complete dicks; occasionally joy riding and egging nothing major but go to places like Manchester and it gets worse pretty quickly but no where near as badly as people make it out to be.

Also don't talk to chavs unless they look like they are 14 or younger even if they are it's best to stay clear, they are more trouble than they are worth. They almost always act like cunts. Lastly, manners; be polite if eating anywhere, mouth closed while eating, elbows off the table (not so important these days) unless it's chips from a chippy etc etc oh and queuing I get the impression that from Reddit Americans don't queue, it's not hard and it's a social norm.",0,1359076730,null,0,false,0,c833fdy,t3_176brt,t1_c833fdy,t3_176brt,null,1431070526,-3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,-3

true,phosphorusP,null,null,"Bringing up the Civil Rights movement reminds me to point out something the UK friends may not appreciate:  Firearms were used extensively by African-Americans to deter violent acts by whites during the era of lynchings.  Just today I was reading a biography of Ida B. Wells-Barnett to the elementary school children I teach U. S. history to, and it noted that Ms. Wells-Barnett (whose life was constantly under threat) made sure it was well known that she was ready to defend herself.  ""Fiercely protective of her family, she kept a pistol in the house and dared anyone to cross the threshold to harm them."" * 

A lot of people mock the idea that we need arms to protect ourselves against a tyrannical government but as recently as the 1950s and 1960s , many people in the American South really *did* live under a tyrannical government.  What else do you call it when judges, police, and lawmakers conspire to look the other way when a whole subpopulation's rights are trampled and when crimes against them go unpunished?  Those memories are not so far off.

However, the shared strife over the last century or so within the northern countries may also have cultured a stronger sense of unity within the northern catholic communities- one distinct from the south. It's all interesting to think about.

Then again, it's also possible that northern territory would be ceded by council district, as opposed to county, since that's how the north currently operates.",0,1359078541,null,0,false,0,c833zp1,t3_171t00,t1_c833zp1,t1_c82g3tc,null,1431070861,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,lostimpostor,yorkshire,York,"So the way the law works in the UK as far as I understand is that police officers are generally something my more educated friend tells are called warranted officers. This means they are private individuals being hired by the government to uphold the law, and overseen by a system of trusts and things. I am assured this is all very good, and means that police officers are something a little more than just violent arms of the state. This arrangement comes from similar origins as the idea of policing by consent. The police are understtod to be effective because of an understanding that there is a social contract between the police and the community.

What this leads to is that even though there are a lot of laws, it is down to the police officer, who is presumed to know more about the community than the law does, to decide whether in this particular case the offense should be pursued. So when a police officer catches a kid smoking weed, although it is probably technically criminal, chances are they will leave them alone for the most part and just tell them not to do it again. It's just a kid and they don't want to give them a hard time, probably got enough to worry about now without ruining their life or their relationship with their parents. If it turns into something more serious, further action might be taken.

Similar with knives. Example. Kids in my village used to carry knives around all the time. They were handy for going on adventures, making dens in the woods and stuff. If, somehow, a police officer had found out we had them, they'd probably just tell us we're not meant to do that and tell us not to take it to the park or any other public places. The point is, they have these laws so that they *can* do something if the situation demands it. It doesn't mean they have to come down like a tonne of bricks on every tiniest thing.

TL,DR: Laws in the UK are often for giving the police options in case a tricky situation comes up, not for making the police go after every stupid little misbehaviour.",0,1359078935,null,0,false,0,c83441y,t3_176jug,t1_c83441y,t1_c82omrr,null,1431070916,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I also heard earlier today that the Sandy Hook shooter also averaged a little less than 10 rounds per reload, but take that with a grain of salt, I don't have a source.

And besides, if reloading takes 5 seconds (which is a pretty slow reload if you've practiced for more than about 5 minutes), then even reloading an extra 30 times would only add 2 and a half minutes to the whole affair.

I like Amy better because she at some point realized that a relationship with the Doctor couldn't last. Amy had a lot of flaws but her relationship with Rory balanced her out. She was also a stronger willed person and more independent than Rose.

Despite the tap-up rules, clubs do this all the time. Prior to any bid there will be a back-and-forward between agents and the club will find out the rough paramaters of what a playing contract would look like. This is to make sure you aren't completely wasting your time with a bid. Ever been surprised that almost every time a club accepts a bid, the player is ok with it and goes along? That is why.

Please stop linking to ITK accounts from here. They don't know. They drive false hope. They are making things up based on reading an aggregate of the news.

So this is why this tweet is wrong/bad: contracts signed in January are always of a length with a half year on them, since they have to end on the 31st of June. So Coutinho's deal will be 3.5, 4.5 or 5.5 years - not 5. 

Easy mistake, it just goes to show that the ITK's have no idea what they are talking about.

It just riles to see moronic arguments like Orsenfelt's above about how internet anonymity should be sacrosanct thrown into this issue, as if the identities of the message-board posters have anything to do with it. Yes, a chilling effect against anonymous violent, sexist threats for their own sake--out of the threat of having those threats widely disseminated--is the desired outcome, but this isn't censorship--only a raising of the level of public debate. To say that the message-board creeps ought to keep the last word just because they're on the internet is merely to make a virtue of cowardice.

All I think is that Beard has set a good example for any public figure (but don't forget, this whole issue is about the particular form of abuse that gets directed at women) in dealing with the rot from the mob, which is to demonstrate in the most simple way that their opinions as they are formulating them aren't worth anything and that they should be ashamed of themselves. A dose of public shame is really the best self-regulating solution for raising the level of public discourse in a world with no mechanisms of prior restraint censorship.

Whether the dimmer denizens of the internet are capable of being shamed is the real question...

Why that correlation seems to exist, I don't know.

The bottommost one is Pienaar.  

I'm pretty sure the one below the neck is Naismith, signature is kinda close and most jerseys he's signed that I saw were at that placement.

The one to the bottom left  of Chang (the leftmost one) is Distin.

The only one in between the three logos that seems close to anything is Fellaini, but don't quote me on that.

The one above the bottom right one is Barkley.

The one directly to the left of the Chang fountain is absolutely Vellios.

The bottom right one sure looks like Coleman's sig.

The one to the right of Chang appears to be Anichebe.

The very bottom left one looks like Duffy's.

The one above Pienaar's and to the right of Duffy's is definitely Baines.

Of the ones I can clearly see, the only one that's really stumped me is the one directly below Chang.  It looks as if there's an 11 or 17 with it, but it doesn't match up to ~~Dreamboat~~ Mirallas and we don't have a 17 anymore, so no clue there.

He then went on to explain that this is why violent video games sell so well. Americans in general want to be violent, because that is how stuff gets done around here. Revolutionary WAR,where we gained our rights. Civil WAR, where we kept the union together and abolished slavery. World WAR II, where we are taught that we were the big guys who saved everybody through violence. I think the same applies for gun ownership, at least on a subconscious level. We feel the need for guns because of a ""what if any shit goes down where I am?"" mentality. We are so focused on these WARS in classes that we start thinking about them more and more. So, we start to wonder what would happen nowadays. At least, that is what it seems like it is for my area. ""How am I going to do anything for myself if another war breaks out?"" We do not see our military and police in action at home or abroad too often, and if we do it is shoved into our faces that it is police brutality or troop brutality. There are so many films, books, games, hell, even America's history where all it is is police corruption. ""What will I do to protect what is mine, and how do I protect the people I love?"" I think that we all believe this on a subconscious level (I talk about republicans when I say all, just because that is how my area is, sorry) and so we all need guns to stop anything from happening to anybody. This guy gives a great example with the revolutionary war. If we did not have guns, we would not have rights, is hammered into us in elementary school. Another thing is that we have many films about ineffective militaries. We get invaded by Russia, and now North Korea, in Red Dawn, and the military is powerless. Zombie movies show the people fending for themselves. What I'm trying to get at is that there are a multitude of factors in our society that make us unwilling to accept gun control, because it just would stop us from fending for ourselves.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Diame wouldn't be my first choice, but can't argue with the price or what you get for it.

According to WhoScored, currently Diame rates 4th in the EPL in tackles per game (Sandro is 13th), 131st in interceptions and is completing 83% of his passes. On the season he is the 52nd rated player in the league at 7.08. All of these numbers are worlds better than Hudd or Jake.

When you look at his season he finished with his highest rated performances against Chelsea (7.91),Arsenal (7.9, 6.19 last week), Sunderland (7.74), Liverpool (7.67). So he has played well in games against the teams that we have to beat.

So for £3.5m you pick up some really quality coverage for Parker for this season and a player who can be a good player for us next year.  Keep in mind that Sandro is likely to be out until September/October if he has no setbacks, and even then it is likely that it will take him some time to get back to his current form.  Meanwhile Scotty is aging.  

For very little financial outlay he would be a a hell of a signing whether he is the player we all would want or not.

true,SirEDCaLot,null,null,"First- know that I am a registered Democrat.  For those not from the use, the Democratic party is usually the anti-gun one.  I am not an NRA member.  I do however like to read.  And here is what I found.

Sure they saw a drop in gun deaths.  But like the uk, they also saw a jump in other forms of violent crime such as rape and home invasion.

Let's look at the numbers- every year in USA about 30,000 people give or take die of gunshot wounds.  A bit over half- about 17,000, are suicides.  These must be factored out- suicidal people will use whatever is available to kill themselves.  An area with more guns will have more gun suicides, an area with more tall buildings and bridges will have more suicides by high fall, people who work in hospitals are more likely to suicide by drug overdose, etc.  While the AU/UK gun bans did lower gun suicides, other types of suicides went up to match.  Therefore we cannot blame the guns for those deaths, and we cannot credit the gun bans for saving those lives.

The remaining 13,000 deaths per year include every person shot by another person.  That includes shootings by cops, shootings by law-abiding citizens protecting their families, and it also includes gang and drug violence.  Te majority of those shootings are gang and drug related, how many depends on the location but in major cities it's a big percentage.  ALL of those gang and drug shootings are done with illegal firearms.  

Criminals don't obey the law.  They don't fill out background checks or follow waiting periods.  Gun bans do not apply to criminals.  

Now gun bans DO apply to law-abiding citizens.  And those law-abiding citizens use their guns in self-defense more than you'd expect.  According to a '90s Department of Justice report (under an anti-gun administration), a citizen uses a firearm in self defense at least 100,000 times per year.  According to a more recent private survey, that might be as high as 2 MILLION- the vast majority of such incidents end with the criminal seeing the gun and running away, so a great many go unreported.  

Now UK/AU don't have much gun crime since the gun ban, but they do have a lot more of other violent crimes since the gun ban.  This is because an armed violent criminal now KNOWS his victim IS defenseless.  I say it's a bad trade- of those 100k-2mil people per year, how many of them would have been raped or injured or killed if they weren't armed?  Quite a lot.

Americans don't like guns because of the NRA and the gun lobby.  We like guns because guns empower us to defend ourselves.

The best case scenario I can imagine is if a large number of 16-17 year olds vote because of the novelty, and as a result their votes have a noticeable effect on a general election. That might increase the amount of young people across the board actually voting.

I didn't like the writing, didn't like Billie Piper, didn't really like any of it. I was told numerous times to keep watching because the show got better with David Tennant. So I watched the first few episodes of season two. Still hated it, so I stopped watching altogether.  

About six months later I decided to give it another try. Honestly, I didn't like the show at all until I got to ""The Girl in the Fireplace."" That one actually caught my interest. I kept watching and by the time I got to ""The Satan Pit"" I was converted. That scene where 10 yells at the beast? BRILLIANT. I'm still getting caught up (part-way through season six), but I'm in love with the show now. 

You have to watch the show with a grain of salt. There are several bad episodes. It just happens. But there are a lot of good episodes too. Yeah, some of the special effects suck and some of the aliens/villains are totally lame (A giant wasp? Really?), but it's the relationships between the characters that make the show worth watching.

Sunday - 

Two live Premier League games most of the time, on Sky Sports.

Monday -

Often there's a live Monday night Premier League game on Sky Sports (this is their best programme, IMO).

If there are midweek fixtures, then these can often be shown live too.

This is topped up with live games from other countries' leagues (La Liga, Bundesliga, SPL etc), so there's ALWAYS a game on.

Try looking at this website, it contains details of every live game being shown across all channels in the UK. You'll see that there are multiple live games being shown every single day of the week.

If you're a programmer/web developer, then that's bullshit - don't listen to that guy.

If you're working as a programmer in C/C++/C#/Java (I'm not sure about PHP/Ruby) then yeah you'd be MUCH better off getting a new job. Seriously, last agency we used to recruit sent me CVs and by the time I had read them and decided to get someone in for interview, they had accepted another position.

Just like I do not need a car that goes over 75 mph, yet mine will still hit 120. That others cannot handle responsibility is not my concern. I am a rational, resourceful, well adjusted adult. The idea that my actions are limited because others cannot be trusted is incredibly galling. Naturally, this does have limits(which, incidentally, are different for anyone, hence all the debate). Few would disagree that nuclear weapons should be something a private individual is never allowed to own, to take the most extreme example. 

When I was 16 I had a Ruger 10/22, as did my brother. I had a nifty idea, and so I went out to the machine shed and started tinkering, and eventually ended up with a holder that would hold both 10/22s, with stocks removed, and alternate trigger pulls with a hand cranked cam. Insert a 50 round clip into each, aim at a suitable target, and blamblamblamblamblamblamblamblamblamblam! 100 rounds of .22 LR. It was, all in all, thoroughly useless as a weapon. Perhaps people in the 1850s may have been impressed with it and used it as an emplaced weapon, but no criminal would ever want one in this day and age.

It was absolutely brilliant fun. Oh, and incidentally, still legal. Hand cranked = semi auto, legally. Had I put an electric motor on there, it would be a nifty felony. 


PS: an assault rifle as defined by the media and politicians, and specifically by the various AWBs out there, does not necessarily mean it is a fully automatic weapon. It basically just means it is a rifle that is black and military looking. 

Here is a comparison that illustrates the disconnect neatly. Non-gun owners would consider this to be an assault rifle: 

http://thespecialistsltd.com/files/Muzzelite.jpg

They would consider this to be a hunting rifle:

http://cdn.firearmstalk.com/images/3/7/1/9/8/23ecceb-1715.jpg


Now, I will point out the key to identifying the difference between these two firearms. The key is: There is no difference. They are the exact same firearm, a Ruger Mini-14 chambered in .223. The only thing altered is the stock, in all other respects they function precisely the same. 

Edit: Noted your edit, making most of my post moot, but the point still stands. 'Assault rifle' essentially just means 'Scary looking gun' instead of 'Somehow a more effective gun'.

I don't believe that the current limit is too high and any watering down of FOI laws would be a big step backwards.

Both the UK and France (and probably others) are looking at not allowing the source money (i.e. that earned in the country) go to foreign locations before being taxed. It's however tricky. Here Starbucks UK was found to pay another Starbucks company abroad (think it might have been Luxembourg) very steep licencing fees. Obviously a tax avoidance scheme. But how do you stop it? You could say licensing fees have to be paid out of the net income once local tax has been removed. But what happens to businesses that really are licensing from a third party that has nothing to do with their company.  

So far I haven't heard what the solution is meant to be. Also, that's just one tiny little aspect. I think accountants who spend all their time working out how to use these loop holes will always be one step ahead of governments as long as tax systems remain complicated.

Normaly a nominal fee is applied below this limit, but it is a fee nonetheless.

However, I think we do have a lot more implicit trust in the *system as a whole*, whereas in the US ""the government"" is often seen as even more evil and corrupt than the individual people who make it up.

Like you we fully expect many of our public officials to be evil, self-serving shitstains, and aren't surprised when it happens.  However, with sufficient unpopularity even their own party will eventually turn on them, lest they be seen to be aligned with the unpopular individuals and punished in the polls.

Take Blair, for example - going into Iraq and the various developments that came out during his second term were deeply unpopular, to the point that his *own party* pressured him into stepping down, lest they lose an entire generation of voters.

Far from something like Clinton's impeachment (a completely partisan attack by the other side), Blair's downfall was engineered by his own party, and solely due to their fear of widespread public opinion.  With a less polarised public discourse and less identification with specific parties, I think we have a larger independent/swing voting population, which in turn requires political parties to be more responsive to public opinion.

So.. yeah.  I suspect you're close, but I think while both the UK and USA typically hate and distrust their elected officials individually, I think in the UK we have a lot more faith in the system as a whole... which likely ties back into/is another way of saying that we have a great respect for tradition, and a certain amount of social/political inertia that that it's hard for any individual (or small number of) bad leaders to overcome.",0,1359110622,null,0,false,0,c83b1cs,t3_176jug,t1_c83b1cs,t1_c83ah9m,null,1431074206,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Its much easier to feel empathy for those in plight when they're a 20 minute walk away from you, rather than say a 3 hour drive, followed by a 2 hour flight - making socialised healthcare more easily acceptable. 

Conversely, the reverse is also true - its much easier to foster religious/cultural hatred and differences, because slight tension can wildly spin off into heated violence. The biggest riots/violence have always been in cities - where the poor and downtrodden were 20 minutes away from say the cleaner streets of south kensington, and this factored into the the whole ""they don't give a shit about us"" view.

Modern medicine can provide drugs, surgery, etc, to help it on its way, but ultimately the body is a self-healing machine and it is the only thing that can rebuild new cells, grow new tissue, and so on (give or take a bit of hand waving when it comes to things like implants, prosthetics, etc).  Given the fact that the body is ultimately controlled by the mind, either consciously or unconsciously, it should come as no surprise to us that palliative care, the placebo effect, and other so-called ""mind over matter"" techniques work.

Certainly, both have their benefits and drawbacks - the UK method arguably tends to result in laws that are viewed as ""fairer"" by contemporary public opinion (or at least, bad laws are more quickly struck down), but leaves it open to creeping normalcy/""boiling the frog"" corrupting the consensus idea of what's ""normal"".

The nazi regime also staged numerous terror attacks to use as pretext to do pretty much whatever the fuck they wanted, most famous is probably the terror attacks that ""forced"" Germany to invade that godless terrorist nest Poland and start the second world war.

In the newly acquired areas such as Chezhoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and France there was a total gun ban for all non-members of the NSDAP. 

Sentences like "" Between upright, law-abiding German citizens and Adolf Hitler, however, there was a real love affair, with mutual trust and respect."" makes me cringe. This one is also very good  ""the National Socialists had no intention of preventing law-abiding Germans from keeping or bearing arms.""  
A quick note on this from me is that being a law-abiding upright german citizens was mutually exclusive to being a jew. A quick note from the author of that despicable piece is that ""two-thirds of the Jews residing in Germany emigrated, reducing the Jewish population of the country from 600,000 when Hitler became Chancellor in 1933 to 200,000 at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939"".

I know Hitler was elected with a majority vote but this article paints it out as if Hitler was the good guy and it makes numerous ""excuses"" and simplifications that work in the favor of Hitler. Absolutely appaling and not one word of that article should be taken seriously.

And under the USC, most males are in the unorganized (which is not to say _unregulated_) militia anyway, which is kinda in the same vein -- if all other defense fails, it's the expectation (and always has been) that Joe Average will pick up his rifle and fight.

This is part of why saying that the founders could never have intended us to have ""Military style"" arms equivalent to what the US infantry carry is kinda absurd. We're _supposed_ to be the last line of defense if all else fails, it's just absurd to believe that they didn't entrust us with that level of power while also tasking us with that responsibility.

Torchwood, and namely RTD, screwed up massively in this direction. Jack isn't immortal in the traditional sense. He just ""refuses"" to stay dead. He's a fixed point in Time and Space. The question is..can his off-spring become this too?

Well, I'm not entirely sure how. We've been told that his immortality is nothing to do with his blood on a few interviews. We've seen in Torchwood: CoE, that he had a daughter and a grand-son, neither of whom have it (this would seem to back it up).

Then Miracle Day happened. Where we found it..actually...it IS his blood and he could, somehow using the Blessing, use blood and, via transfusion and ""the blessing"", make someone else a fixed point and therefore immortal too.

Having said that though, it's a totally different kind. With Jack, he comes back. With Clara, she's already there. With Jack, there was one of him from the getgo, and still one of him now.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"In truth, we need both.

You are dead on about the need for a mid that can cover for Dembele.  We were horrible when Dembele was hurt and we need to add some depth with some offensive ability. Getting Holtby would be perfect for us and give us this coverage.  Losing Sandro we really could use some coverage for a DM slot, keep in mind that Sandro is likely out until September/October next season and Soctty is aging, that means someone who can cover for Sandro and Scotty is actually pretty important, Jake doesn't look ready to be on the field for us and Hudd (who i really like) just doesn't seem to suit the role for us as he is just too soft defensively.  Really makes a move for someone like Diame look like a smart move, cover and depth for this season and cover for Sandro's recovery and Soctty's aging next season.

That said, we need a striker.  We have needed a striker for about the past 5-6 windows.  Harry asked for one, and now we are even hearing AVB saying that we could use another. We just don't have that absolute threat to score at the moment, we don't have someone who can create a shot for himself in the box and we don't have the guy who can take advantage and just poach goals in the box created by our midfield/wings. Problem is they are expensive at any time but in a January window they are well overpriced.  I think a loan deal for someone like Callejon would make the most sense.  In the summer we can go back in for the big named striker, right now someone like Callejon would be cheap and provide cover on the wing as well as up top.

We are in a great spot in the league and Dempsey and Gylfi can cover in short stretches for either center mid or striker but that isn't ideal.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I'd like to see the Arsenal game before I decide on my personal player of the month. Suarez, Sturridge, Gerrard and Henderson are difficult to seperate at the moment. However, I don't think Henderson may actually be considered 'Best player of the month', but more of 'Most improved player of the month', maybe.

If we were to break down the fixtures one by one, with MoTM for each one, this would be mine:

Sunderland: Suarez. Nothing much to say, Gerrard's close behind I guess.

Mansfield: Hard to say. I'll leave this blank, I guess. Sturridge should have had three or four, at the very least two. Suarez didn't really have a chance to make a huge impact because we were being pressed. I think given his ability he should have scored that 'handball goal' legitimately. I'll probably go for Jones on this one, but there's no way he'll make player of the month, so that's the equivalent of leaving in blank. 

Man United: Sturridge...? I guess? The game changed once he came on, managed to get off a few shots but none of them even troubled De Gea, He did get a goal (albeit through a rebound) and looked really good, ~~so I think I'll hand him this one.~~ On second thought, I might just give this to Agger or Gerrard. They both played really well that match, come to think of it.

Norwich: Uhhh, hard to say. I think I'll go for Gerrard, he was good defensively and offensively, got a good goal too. But dammit, Henderson also played really well. And so did Sturridge. And Suarez. And Johnson. Can't decide, ~~but I think Henderson's goal got us going and Gerrard made a huge impact, so I'll let them tie for this one.~~ On second thought, I think I might let all four of them tie for this one.

Tallying up we've got:

Suarez with 1 (Sunderland) + 0.75 (Norwich) = **1.75**

Sturridge with 0.75 (Norwich) and 0.5 (Man United) = **1.25**

Gerrard: 0.75 (Norwich) and 0.5 (Sunderland) + 0.5 (Man United) = **1.75**

Henderson: **0.75** (Norwich)

I decided to give decimals cause it's kind of difficult to give a full point at times.

This is just my opinion anyway. I think Henderson has improved his game a lot and has had generally better performances, but it's difficult to find a match where you would label him MoTM, especially since he hasn't even played one full match (90 mins) this month.

The problem is your classic prisoner's dilemma (which could otherwise be titled ""why the free market is bollocks""). Individually everyone saving is the right solution locally. However that sucks demand out of the system. From each actors perspective the best thing is for everyone to spend apart from them. This of course leads to everyone saving. These people don't have a perception filter. They are just investing in their own best interest in a market where that feeds back into an overall recession.

The point behind deficit spending is for the government to be the one acting counter to its local best interests. It'll be the one to say ""we'll be the first people to do the right thing"". This means the government will lose money. Nobody denies this. Nobody ever has. However it creates the situation in which it is easier for the rest of the economy to invest rather than save. By government ramping up spending it creates new opportunities which counteract the dilemma.

Really the whole mess comes down to people underestimated two things. The first thing that was underestimated is how strongly the market would follow government in cutting spending. Economists supporting austerity ran much lower expectations. That is why the economy is tanking more than we thought it would. The second thing that was underestimated was the marginal utility of stimulus spending. The US has seen larger growth from stimulus spending than was predicted. No sane economist at this point is backing austerity. It is one of those rare moments where economists have a shared opinion.

The simple truth is the assumptions behind the models driving austerity have been shown to be false.

In the kitchen, Gervaise the chef - a sensitive type - went to the seafood tank to find one. And there, nestled at the bottom of the tank, was a solitary squid. A squid of beautiful colouring: mild, creamy green. A distasteful job, then, to take the life of this charmingly hued cephalopod. 

Gervaise reached down to grasp the squid. His hand closed around its mantle. He raised it from the tank. The squid fixed him with its watery gaze. As their eyes met, Gervaise's resolve broke. ""I can't do it"", he cried. 

""But Gervaise"", his sous-chef pleaded, ""the guests must eat. We are a restaurant. It is our very raison d'etre"". 

Gritting his teeth, Gervaise looked around his kitchen. And there was Hans. Hans, the dishwasher. Brutish, brawny and Teutonic, Hans was everything Gervaise was not. Gervaise explained what needed to be done. Hans nodded. Reaching into the tank, he gripped the squid and lifted it onto the chopping block. HE raised the cleaver. Gervaise looked away. 

But what was this? Hans looked closer. Was the squid crying? Surely those were tears. They were! In a final twist of the emotional knife, Hans noticed the tiny, almost invisible hairs adorning the squid's top lip (or supra-beak region, if you will). Unconsciously, his own hand brushed his little moustache, which he had only that week begun to grow. The cleaver fell. Hans couldn't do it. The squid lived. The diner chose duck.

I think you have put your finger on something important. I have always wondered about the lawsuit-happy nature of American soceity: how comes judges or juries focus so much on the letter of the law instead of a common-sense understanding of what social norms those are supposed to protect?

But the UK is losing it, IMHO. Consider banning drinking on the underground. Here in Vienna only _excessive_ drinking is forbidden on the subway, with the general assumption that the drinkers, the controllers, the police, and the other passengers can agree to a general, unspoken norm to what excessive is, without having to define it explicitly. 

I also don't think it is really the age of a country that matters, or even that there is such a thing as an age of a country. The first American settlers generally took Scottish Dissenter cultural norms with them. Others took other norms. So it is not like founding a country is a carte blanche. More like, it is the _diversitiy of cultures within a country_ that leds to the loss of unspoken, generally accepted norms that need not be defined - common sense in the literal sense of the sensus communis, the shared ""pattern recognition"" of a community.

When I lived in the UK, I have seen Cameron's election campaign on TV. Apparently one of his points was to implement more discipline in schools. And the fun part was an interview at a Caribbean radio, where the Caribbeans bascially urged him to bring back corporal punishment at schools and he was upset and couldn't really even explain why he won't, he was just like ""no, really no, just... no, all right? really no, let's just talk about something else"". Conservative or not, he was part of a community where it is simply no longer part of the set of cultural norms that turned more liberal in education, shared the sensus communis, and was just baffled to face people who simply share a different cultural code and expect real arguments, not this kind ""it's just not our thing anymore, period"". When a society becomes multicultural, people cannot rely on these unspoken agreements anymore, and have to actually start debating - which may be a good thign, to turn on the brain and actually inspect norms, but the bad part is that it leads to the American kind of society where there must be a literal rule for everything and someone will try to enforce it literally and some others will try to exploit it by sticking to the letter, not the meaning.",0,1359127656,null,0,1359128023,0,c83dqpv,t3_176jug,t1_c83dqpv,t1_c82p4y2,null,1431075549,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Totalitaria - where the government had a law that everyone needs to be silent at all times. The police are armed with muskets from the 18th century and the general population has handguns and assault rifles. Jokes aside, this scenario is just not going to work out, I'm sure you understand why.

The question which regimes links gun control to totalitariansim is a very strange question since it would be called a civil war and not say, genocide, if the population was armed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Conversely, I think we're much more ""social"", in the sense of being comfortable with contributing to and profiting from a support network.

This is actually a much more complicated issue which I never managed to analyse completely, I can give a partial analysis and ask you and others to contribute.

I have never understood the American concept of ""either individualism or big governmet"" - I think actually individualism = big government!

If you live a communal life, strong support network, basically a socialism with your blood relatives and social democracy with your friends, so if you are NOT an individualist, then you do not really need big government that much, social democracy as much, as this gives you a useful cushion in case of any bad turns in life.

But if you live an individualist life, where even your brother _loans_ you money instead of just giving it when you need it, then of course  it is easy to feel the desire for a more active government, because life is precarious and risky.

So by this logic, community-oriented cultures like the old UK or todays Latin America, or small-town Norway with Jante's Law, where people are comfortable with contributing to the support network of family and friends around them, should actually have small, libertarian government! And individualist cultures like the US where people have a kind of a business-like relationship with everybody ouside their household, and happily chuck granny into a retirement home instead of nursing her at home, should have big, social democratic government!  This would make total sense.

Yet, we see literally the opposite happening in the world and it makes no sense at all!

Let's now add the question of lifestyle. Pretty much in every country, it is the same people (left-leaning) who argue for more government support network, are the same people who argue that it is OK for people to live their life they want to, like be transsexual for example, so in this way a more individual life, less influenced by community norms. It makes sense, given that such people are less likely to have a large support network, get help from the community, because they are not liked that much because they do not conform to the community norms. And similarly, people living a conservative lifestyle, family, a bit of church, a solid job, no tattoes, stuff like that, can generally expect plenty of support network, so they do not really need the government that much. This also makes sense. And actually it pretty much happens this way, so in this part my logic checks out fine. Yet in the other part, described above, my analysis predicts literally the opposite of what actually happens in the world!

This matters. Much of poltical feelings can be reduced to feminine, be nice, nurturing mother, yin feelings vs. masculine, strict father, be tough, Yang feelings. So you proposed it was based a Yin idea, but AFAIK back it was more like Yang.

Frankly, to associate ""left"" causes with feel-for-ya Yin emotions is pretty new and it would be a huge mistake to see history so. Also, I think the ""Yin left"" is an American invention then gradually influenced Europe. But traditionally the European (incl. British) left, socialists, workers movements were Yang as hell! It was all raised fists and fight the class enemy, it was not a ""nanny"" atttitude.

One of the most important insights into the differences of American and European political feelings is IMHO the _different kinds of masculine/Yang models_: in the American mind the  Yang feeling is connected wit the vision of a strong man who can live off his work and sees governmental assistance as a weakness, while in Europe the Yang feeling is connected with a tough man leading society with a firm hand and reins in all who dares to disobey.",0,1359129777,null,0,false,0,c83echj,t3_176jug,t1_c83echj,t1_c83b73b,null,1431075871,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Ramires---Lamps/Oscar---Hazard

We kept bitching the strikers weren't good enough, so we got Ba, but Benitez still plays solo striker! Torres might be slower, and a bit off his game, but with help up front from Ba the two of them could go off any given moment. Especially if we unclog the play in the middle that makes us so easy to defend by only placing Mata in center attack support. Hazard and Ramires can both stretch the wings and create play to the box, which will open the middle back up for the classic give n' go between Mata/Torres/Ba.

Apparently we also put in a new bid for Ince to get it done before the window closes, but as history shows with Blackpool, they aren't afraid to shut down moves if they don't meet their valuations. It may again be a deal that is completed in the summer.

People forget that there's a reason people are sensitive over what nationality Northern Ireland is. Because there's two major communities. It's not surprising that people panic over 'a mere flag' when in reality is represents the undermining of Britishness to most of the people. It seems to be politically correct to undermine Britishness.

I'd imagine the competing of the parades between greens and oranges are to do with expressing a one true voice of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland wants a single identity like England and Scotland, but it finds itself fighting with another group bent on showing what it wants Northern Ireland's single identity to be. Northern Ireland doesn't want to become a UN administrated territory, it wants to be part of a larger country. 

There is frustration that the nationalists and unionists didn't split apart after the partition of Ireland. The frustration that unionists from the south moved to the north to end the issue of which country owned what or was whichever nationality, and that many nationalists stayed, even southerners coming up north to 'threaten' the sovereignty of a part of the UK. Why not just move to the independent Republic of Ireland if it meant that you were no longer in Britain? This is the logic of creating two Irelands, one that is British and one that isn't. Why couldn't the people have respected that.

What about the frustration that a united Ireland wouldn't treat Northern Ireland in the same way that the UK was guilt tripped into treating Northern Ireland? Like being able to claim either nationality? Or the impartial devolved affairs that Northern Ireland has now, as if it were it's own independent state?

This is purely a British unionist perspective from someone who has never been to Northern Ireland but has watched. Couldn't the nationalists have moved down south? Or was there a 'why should I move?' rhetoric going around even though it meant conflict and a divided society?

I think that's key here. I've been saying for some time that the majority of English people view NI as a part of Ireland that we reluctantly ""own"", and not actually as a part of the United Kingdom. And if NI wanted to leave the UK I really cannot see that being viewed as a bad thing or even generating a fraction of the press coverage that the mere concept of Scottish independence has.

Somebody, in good faith of course, reported the animal to the RSPCA as it looked it may be suffering abuse. Of course, it wasn't, but the person who reported it had the cats best interests at heart.

The RSPCA found the cat, took it to a shelter and euthanised it before starting up some crap about the guy abusing the cat. Obviously the bloke was devastated and nothing came of the charges, but the cheek required to take somebodies pet and murder it is beyond belief.

Also, if you feel like donating to a charity, donate to Dogs Trust or the PDSA. My dog broke her leg when she was a pup, and we were without insurance for her. We needed to get specialist care, or have her leg amputated. We really didn't want to have her leg amputated at such a young age, so we turned to charities and friends to try and raise the money for the surgery which was just over £1000. Dogs trust gave us £300 towards the surgery and the PDSA gave us about £200. The RSPCA refused to give us anything. Eventually we got the surgery and our dog is right as rain!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;In the UK most police officers are unarmed, correct?

I think this is a huge issue that is largely forgotten. I am originally from N. Ireland, where all police are armed as a result of the Troubles. I now live in Scotland, where under most circumstances the police are unarmed. The difference this makes to me as a citizen is amazing. Back in NI, both the catholics and protestants dislike the police and automatically think of them as 'the enemy'. As an armed group, we see them as a group that thinks themselves to be above us. In Scotland, the police are 'real people' that I can actually reply on. If I walked past (I walk really fast) police in NI then came across strangers drinking on the street, I would warn them to hide their alcohol as police were coming, as fucking the police over is a win in my books. I would not do the same in Scotland as there in no inbuilt animosity.

This year I am in Paris, where there are soldiers that patrol the streets in threes with large assault rifles of some sort. My Scottish friends were visiting me last week and when the first time the saw the soldiers they were astonished and felt really uncomfortable having them around.

I don't know how true this is, but from the American media I get the impression that a lot of people in the US do not like the police. I would suggest that having an armed police contributes to this greatly. ",0,1359138626,null,0,false,0,c83h995,t3_176jug,t1_c83h995,t1_c830kwo,null,1431077201,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Let's be polite and call it about seventeen minutes from first call to actual police presence. (disregarding Warren v. District of Columbia, something I highly recommend you look into) 17 minutes is a long time without assistance when dealing with a given criminal element, and in my mind more than justifies private gun ownership.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; Would you provide an example of a situation where that would be an effective form of protest?

It kind of goes beyond mere ""protest"", but something like an armed insurgency is a lot easier to prosecute with an armed population - think the Iraqi insurgency or a ""[Red Dawn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dawn)"" type scenario.

It's not about the act of ""protesting"", or a stand-up fight, so much as it is the fear of dragging the government into a years-long armed insurgency that they'll have very little chance of ""winning"".  As the UK learned in N. Ireland and the USA is in the process of learning in Iraq and Afghanistan, you can't stamp out insurgency - the more draconian and harsh you become, the more you alienate previously-sympathetic civilians and boost recruitment for the insurgents.

If you look at models like the Troubles in N. Ireland the *very best* they could reasonably hope for as regards an actual *solution* would be years or decades of casualties and armed violence, followed by an extremely protracted process of political negotiation and eventual compromise.

Guns aren't useful as a formal protest, because any open insurrection would be steamrolled over in about five seconds flat by the combined might of the US Army.  They're threatening to governments because they more easily empower average citizens to - in the limit case, for serious enough issues - stage an ongoing, protracted, money- and energy-sapping insurgency that (realistically) will only ever end in a negotiated settlement anyway... and if the government seriously thinks that's a likely possibility, they might as well give in and start negotiating in the first place.",0,1359140316,null,0,1359140604,0,c83huhv,t3_176jug,t1_c83huhv,t1_c83ezw1,null,1431077477,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Funny enough; when our second federal government was being illegally formed [the constitutional convention's secretive nature was actually illegal under the articles of confederation] there was immense debate between the founders over whether the country should have a bill of rights or not. Those in favor, argued that if there was no explicit list of how power shall be distributed, the government would be at risk of creeping its authority beyond what was intended to the point of infringing on peoples' rights. Those against, [think Thomas Jefferson], worried that if we made an explicit list of how rights &amp; powers were to be divided up, in time it would come to be seen as a comprehensive list [in other words; if you don't see it on the list, you don't have it as a right]. *The bill of rights was never intended by either side to be a comprehensive list of the peoples' rights &amp; protections*.

Yet all this time later, and that's precisely what seems to have happened. Good luck trying to convince the government you have the right of anything that's not allotted to you in the bill of rights [and subsequent newer amendments]. I strongly believe that if firearms hadn't been mentioned in the bill of rights, Americans today would not have any perceived right to own arms.

Consider, that up until a few decades into the 20th century, it was perfectly legal &amp; somewhat common for civilians in the US to own military grade ordnance. We're talking heavy artillery and explosives here. And these military grade cannons were actually put into action on occasion, like in Bleeding Kansas where people had moved into the territory so that they could fight with each other over whether the territory would become a slave state or a free state. During the days immediately before the civil war there was a famous newspaper editor in a southern city [forget which one] who would fire his large military surplus cannon off to alert the public every time a state voted to secede. In the middle of a major city. If you had the means to buy it, you could have it. Rarely any exceptions. Part of why this stopped was after WW1 there were several [mostly race] riots in the US where war surplus machine guns, planes, and artillery were being used in the streets between opposing factions. With a ""right to bare arms"" but no explicit ""right to ordnance,"" it was easy for the government to step in and start restricting access to ordnance and today the ATF will go to town on you if they think you're experimenting with your own explosives.

Without a bill of rights, Jefferson believed the people would simply monitor what the government was doing &amp; use the democratic process to make sure their unspecified rights weren't being infringed upon. As much as he was right about the bill of rights becoming a comprehensive list, we can safely assume his alternative plan would not have worked. Most every day Americans don't even know who their representatives are, and are more preoccupied with sports/American idol/crap reality tv.

For the record most charities we deal with get huge discounts at vets and sometimes we do things at cost.

Another issue i have with them is that RSPCA inspectors do not have to have any animal experiance to become an inspector. In fact having experiance can be a detriment to getting the job.

Training requirements and skills for RSPCA inspectors are substandard. Many times in my area deer have been hit by cars, caught in a fence etc and require euthanasia. However the licensed inspectors are a liability when it comes to humane dispatch. for example one inspector had a captive bolt gun and pithing rod. Was authorised to use it and had no idea on how to actually use them. In the end a local farmer used a High-powered rifle to put the poor beast out of its misery.

Later, yes.  Not at first.  People were scared and angry.  Here's a more-2001 thought process:

&gt; The World Trade Center, the Pentagon...if these weren't safe, what was?  ""Why, we could have crushed that country, and here they are thumbing their nose at us and shielding someone who just attacked our government and our people.  This self-restraint stuff about granting sovereign privileges to countries *and* not making war can't mean just standing there and getting attacked.  We're the United States.  We're not going to sit there while our military headquarters and tallest office complex are bombed by someone, while thousands of our citizens are killed, and have a country tell us ""no, we don't feel that we are going to turn the guy over to you"".  We've been holding back the hawks for too long; it's time to let them take off the gloves and re-establish a reputation for being costly to attack.

The Executive attempted as much as possible to confuse Iraq with 9/11 while avoiding making explicit statements; two years after 9/11, [70% of Americans believed that Saddam was personally involved with 9/11](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm).  Hence, a lot of this was fear, anger and a feeling that we had been playing reasonably and were being victimized for it.

The UK probably saw a similar analog in the Falklands War.  Does the UK actually have a deep need for the Falklands?  No, probably not.

The resultant debt bubbling often happens when a country experiences decline in its one dominant industry.

true,emperor000,null,null,"&gt; When pressed, Americans typically point to the 2nd Amendment (well, technically a specific interpretation of the 2nd Amendment, but let's not split hairs) which argues that a well-armed populace is necessary to keep the government in line

I appreciate your rationalization, but this part is problematic. It isn't necessarily that specific interpretation that causes people to argue for the right to own guns. That is the reason given for that 2nd amendment being included in the Constitution (""A well regulated Milita..."") in the first place.

The argument that the 2nd amendment enumerates the right to own firearms is different. The amendment reads something like:

&gt; A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, **the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.**

Emphasis added by me, of course. Paraphrasing: ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" There is little, if any, room for interpretation there. It unequivocally forbids the infringement of the ability to bear arms. 

Of course, this has already happened. Our right to bear arms has been infringed to some degree through various policies and laws. The sources of that infringement and how reasonable they are and so on is a different discussion.

Anyway, my point is that people don't point to a certain/specific interpretation of the 2nd amendment to explain that it provides the right to bear arms. That specific interpretation has to do with *why* it provides the right to bear arms.

Police in the US do gun buybacks all the time. Usually the most they'll give you is a couple hundred dollars per fireable gun- a mere fraction of what guns are worth, with caps on how many guns you can exchange for money. Not a lot of incentive there to turn in a firearm &amp; the more are taken out of circulation the more valuable they're going to be.

There was a news story a few weeks ago about some little old lady who got $200 in a gun buyback by turning in a gun worth $60,000 to collectors. Anyone who has a gun that valuable &amp; wanted to get rid of it, probably wouldn't give it to the police if they knew what they had.

Also, a lot of our cops are gun enthusiasts themselves so its not unusual for particularly desirable guns that end up in police stations to find their way into the personal gun collections of police officers. NY used to be really bad about this for handguns because by law any registered handgun had to be turned into the police when the licensee dies. The police would hold onto it for like 6 months and then could do whatever they want with it if it still isn't claimed. But it takes more than 9 months to get the license, so if the family member set to inherit the gun doesn't already have a license that heirloom is going to be lost forever.",0,1359143568,null,0,false,0,c83izk7,t3_176jug,t1_c83izk7,t1_c83bh2f,null,1431078096,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

When Bush Sr was running for re-election in 1992 IIRC there was a big deal out of the fact that he revealed he didn't know what bar codes were for. He didn't even do his own grocery shopping and hadn't ever had to buy something from a ""real"" store himself. That's what the help was for.

Its my perception that a lot of the people who advocate for these laws are better-off and live in areas where they don't really need to have to think about self protection, or killing big game [bears, wolves, etc], and so they view those who do face those realities as unreasonably paranoid tin hat types. My grandmother who lives in a quiet condo association in suburbia where no meaningful crime has ever happened, has no idea why anyone would *want* a gun. OTOH I live in a city not far from an impoverished area, where the war on drugs has caused the militarization of street gangs and caused normal every day people to have to worry about self defense. One night I woke up to find a 16 year old kid on my doorstep. One of the local gangs thought he was in a rival gang [case of mistaken identity] and had kidnapped him off the streets, robbed him, beat him, and then threw him out of the car once they believed he didn't know where he was.

true,landragoran,eccleston,Eccleston,"&gt;One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is no problem with changing the course of history—the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end.

&gt;The major problem is simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be descibed differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is futher complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father.

true,skullfuckery,null,null,"I work for a pet shop you would probably deem evil, and I've heard too many bad stories from customers about the RSPCA. Is it anecdotal? Sure, but there's plenty of them.

A lady brought her rabbits in to us for rehoming. She was a fosterer for the RSPCA and they gave her 2 big gorgeous rabbits to foster, one of whom developed an ear infection in her care. She phoned the RSPCA to ask them for money to treat it, and they told her they couldn't. She could pay herself, or they would take them back and PUT THEM TO SLEEP. Not just the sick one, BOTH. 

We ended up taking them, treating them, and rehoming them with a lovely family who keep them as house bunnies and send us photos of them all the time.  You might be interested, for contrast, that our ""big evil pet shop that doesn't care about animals"" once spent £600 on vet bills for one single hamster. We have zero limit on the price for rehabilitating an animal. The vets we use have nothing but bad things to say about their dealings with the RSPCA too.

Not just that, but I hear of people refused dogs and cats for ridiculous reasons, including someone being out of the house for two hours a day. If they could just relax the rules a little bit, so many more animals could find homes. Two hours is nothing, plenty of dogs could cope with that. And worse, people refused a dog at the RSPCA will just go and buy a puppy, which only makes the problem worse. I wish I could understand why they behave this way, I fail to see who benefits from their overly strict rules. They could do great things, and I'm sure they do, but as long as they spend donations on TV adverts and court cases instead of animal care I would not donate.

I'm a huge fan of the club, I listen to all games on the radio or watch them on streams even if they are at 4AM here (Aus). I post a lot on the subreddit, and consider myself pretty active on here since I found the subreddit.

I check twitter every 30 minutes or so and try to keep up with all the latest news, so if anything major happens I can submit it quickly and keep everyone notified.

I have quite a bit of experience and moderate 6 subreddits at the moment, here is my [stattit](http://stattit.com/user/battlesmurf/), and would obviously love to be a part of the team moderating something that is quite important to me, and everyone here.

Also every night I pray at my shrine of Billy Bremner and Don Revie in the hopes that Max Gradel will return along with Snoddy, Howson and Beckford in a huge fireworks display whilst descending from the heavens and that Becchio will stay.

I might add a bit more later, its 4:30 AM here and my laptop is on 3%!

&gt; Both of which are listed anyway - so any future occupant would have to preserve them.

Like fine art in a billionaire's vault, to be seen by only the very the few.

&gt; So again - why does the RI need to be in that specific building?

It is part of our heritage. Owned by the Ri, we can all see it and experience it; owned by some private company, it will all be locked away.

&gt; Lots of institutions move around, and have had discoveries made in buildings that are now offices, shops etc - science is not diminished by that. It's not as if the physical room actually adds anything to the history of the invention. It's a minor curiosity, that is all.

For you it is a minor curiosity. For others, being in the very location occupied by great achievers of the past is inspiring. It inspires the children and students who visit, and it inspires the scientists who work there.

&gt; If the RI really wants to support science - sell the damn building and invest the surplus in bursaries for students. That would do more for science, and make the dusty old RI relevant again.

Indeed, why not sell-off all of our heritage to the highest bidder and invest it similarly? In a few decades, after the benefits gained have been squandered, we will have nothing to show for it.

History in books and slides and films and websites is nowhere near as inspiring as history that you can walk into, touch, and even smell.

I may well be wasting my time with you. However, if anything that I have said has succeeded in chipping away even the smallest piece of your cynicism, then it was worth it ;)

I have also done quite a few match threads for discussions and rants (he he) on our recent fixtures. As I'm Irish I cannot visit games and so all my live scores come from the lovely Jeff Stelling and the Mightywhites radio streams so I'm on my laptop for 90% of the games so the match threads are just something to pass the time on and I enjoy doing them :)

1) We don't have the personnel to have two strikers playing more than 60 minutes every match. They will exhaust themselves and they have no one else on the bench to give them a break. This might work short-term, but by April we will crash.

2) Almost any scenario with two strikers sees Mata forced wide, and while he is still good on the wing, he simply doesn't have the same control over the game as he does in the middle.

3) And I truly believe this is most important, there is nothing in Torres' past that says playing him with a second striker will work. At Liverpool he was the solo-man, the most competition he got was from David N'gog. At Atletico his two least productive seasons were when another striker saw significant time on the pitch, his last season there with Aguero, and the season before that with Kezman (yes, that Kezman).

* Criminal is heard breaking and entering, resident brandishes a weapon. Either the sound of the weapon or the appearance of the weapon gives the criminal second thoughts... if not, criminal possibly gets shot.

* Criminal is engaging in illegal activity, and a citizen with a weapon brandishes it more surreptitiously and depending on circumstances takes the action of shooting or detaining the criminal.

Nobody I've spoken with has had delusions of winning an old west style draw. Indeed, this would be counter intuitive particularly in the case of rifles, which are generally what's recommended for bans.

Whether disproportionate force is used is best decided by the state government. Some allow for ""standing your ground"", whereas others do not allow lethal force except under extreme circumstances. I don't think it's quite so black and white. I wouldn't shoot a teenager stealing my xbox, for example, but if a large man with a crowbar breaks into my house when I'm away on business, I hope my wife would have the capacity to at least shoot him in the foot with a shotgun and protect my children and herself.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think reddit brings out the worst in people on any side, and things quickly deteriorate into insults and ideology. People on one side require quick reductionist justifications for owning weapons, and the other side counters with ""government nukes FTW"".

It's not necessarily about swearing by a piece of paper, but it is the founding document that allows us to function as a society. If we cannot trust that our government will be appropriately limited according to the edicts of that ""piece of paper"", then we are not a proper society, and will quickly devolve into chaos.

That said, new measures can be introduced via the proper channels and new amendments can be passed. Slavery wasn't ended with the ""Emancipation proclamation"" of Abraham Lincoln (even that proclamation didn't apply to all states anyways), it was the 13th amendment which went through the proper channels. In fact, it was the fear the south had of the abolitionism movement that caused that great schism to begin with. So without a constitutional amendment over guns, simply passing legislation with a ""haha see we don't need to follow the law, we can do as we please"" could lead to more big schisms.

The argument of tyranny is an interesting one, and is often ridiculed or caricatured, but the reality is it can come in more forms than simply as civilian vs. military toe-to-toe match. We've also seen governments take control by force or be elected into power that were greatly dangerous and wish we would have seen the general population rise up in resistance against it. At the very least, being able to resist tyranny before succumbing to it is believed to be a right.. the right to attempt to escape it, even if we fail. Suffice to say this is a more complex issue than the ridicule it typically gets.

I think the UK has done well in terms of safety, but American's might not believe incremental improvements to safety ""at any cost"" are acceptable. My general understanding in interacting on the internet is that the UK see's the government as a body meant to restrict rights, whereas American's see the government as a body meant to preserve rights (and any laws passed to restrict rights are accepted quite begrudgingly and under a great deal of justification). I think the UK is generally safer than the US, but the general implication that the United States is fiercely inhospitable due to the overwhelming violence only betrays an ignorance that doesn't factor a wealth of factors. I personally think the US murder rate is fairly low, especially when compared to true dangerous countries.

Finally, I don't own a gun... but I will probably buy a gun.

true,chamo13,1953,Tore Andre Flo,"While I see your point, there are unfortunately a few issues that mean that there just isn't a surefire way Chelsea could approach this appeal. 

First, there is no *absolute* evidence that his kick did not, in some way, touch or harm the ballboy. Sure, you can point to the ball squirting out, but no angle shows *absolutely and undeniably* that no contact was made. 

This is what the case is based on, and in the FA's eyes, there is no point at which you should ever come in contact, especially in a way that can be deemed violent, with a ballboy in any extent of the game (unless you are in danger of course).

At the end of the day, it was a poor bit of judgement by Hazard, he should have left it to the referee, but I think we all know it was just a reaction to the frustration and not meant to be something malicious. 

My point last post was not to say not making contact warrants the same punishment, rather that the most common defense is that he only made contact with the ball, which cannot be proven (in hindsight, perhaps my initial post was a bit unclear of that point).

Say, for example, Hazard had drawn back like he was going to punch the child to make him flinch and lose concentration so that Hazard could snatch the ball from him. While no contact is made, Hazard would still, and justifiably so, be given a ban by the FA (This is merely an example).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, it makes sense, and it is a valid point. It's a tough call I suppose. In many cases (in most cases that I've observed) the criminal is caught off guard, or has no gun on hand. 

General criminal gun violence in the united states is gang related rather than larceny (Between 1990 and 1994, 75% of all homicide victims age 21 and younger in the city of Boston had a prior criminal record. In Philadelphia, the percentage of those killed in gun homicides that had prior criminal records increased from 73% in 1985 to 93% in 1996.). Unfortunately similarly to how lumping in England with Scotland paints a disproportionate picture of crime than addressing them individually, using blanket statistics don't tell us a lot about the realities of the situation (although they do fuel both sides arguments endlessly and quite nicely!)

If you find yourself in Detroit or Chicago you'll be far more at risk than if you find yourself in Seattle. There are big reasons for this... poverty, racial issues, gangs... 

I think you're right though, in that the decision to brandish a weapon could heighten the danger you are in. It's a risk, and hopefully one people think about good and hard beforehand and have the right plan to execute for when the time comes. The reality is unwillingness to use a brandished weapon puts you in a great deal of danger as well. I don't know if the RIGHT choice is necessarily to defend yourself with a gun, but I do personally strongly believe int he right to make that decision for yourself. I don't' think anybody should be forced into a position of being a victim.

While the above is a concept for a weaponised version, there's no reason this can't be applied to surveillance ones.  A network of them could simply fly back to base to recharge and be replaced by another one automatically.

It's kind of cool and scary what's available now and in the future.

And if you look at it in the end of the day, there are these guys getting on their moral high horse and jumping on his back, but um, I don't think it's as bad as everyone's making out to be. There's a little bit of devilment(?) from the kid to deferred(?) him. I think he know exactly what he was doing. But, and...if it was me, I'd be upset. You know, you can't lay on the ball as a ball boy. Usually when kids see players coming over they're like, 'Can you take the ball please, Mr. Hazard', but this one knew exactly what he was doing. (Interviewer, 'So when you, for ??? say go 1 or 2 up against Juventus) Oh yes. (are you telling you ball boys to lie on...) Disappear! I've seen it happen. You know, I've seen it happen a lot of times in Europe a lot of times, you know. Whenever we've been up away from home, these balls are coming on rapidly. For chasing the game then the ???

Ally McCoist
&gt; I've played in games where the ball boys have withdrawn their services with their ??? (Scottish is tough. :( ). And I'm not kidding you, all of a sudden the ball boys have disappeared. No I, I think the whole thing was probably blown out of proportion. To be quite honest, I've got a far far greater degree of sympathy for the player.

Arsene Wenger
&gt; The ball boys are there to get the ball as quickly back to the...to the, to the, back to the players and into the game. They are not there to waste time. So uh, and you have to educate the ball boys with not matter is it the home team or the away team, you get the ball back as quickly as possible. And everything else is not acceptable. And uhh, uhh for the rest of...Hazard wanted, Hazard is not a violent player. You know, he wanted uhh...uhh to get the ball back as quick as possible, as you can understand. In my opinion, went in a little uhh, too strongly. But I don't think he wanted to hurt the boy, he just wanted just to get the ball back as quickly as possible.
