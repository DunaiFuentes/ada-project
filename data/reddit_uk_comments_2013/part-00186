However it always bugs me when people try and emulate this by doing, for example, 'Premier League Power Rankings', which is a bit redundant since comparing teams within the same league is relatively easy.

I think a military force can potentially be a (risky, expensive) factor in a peace process. It's possible that weapons inspectors in Syria could have their mandate extended to the destruction of said weapons, with a nearby international troop deployment as leverage for compliance. 

Of course, as you say, a big difference between Mali/SL and Syria is that (afaik) none of the Syrian factions wants a foreign army to become involved in disarmament. If that were to change, and the Security Council could agree on a mission, I wouldn't automatically shirk away from the boots.

Mali was hardly an altruistic intervention by France and France created the conditions that necessitated their intervention.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"An update on how he's doing:

He's been very good for Almeria, assisting two goals and playing an important role in a couple others. What's important is that he's dealing well with the additional responsibility of being one of their best players; he's showing a lot more patience in possession and not trying to rush too many things. He's started tracking back more intelligently, he's always been willing to but against Getafe and Elche he won the ball more effectively than I've seen him do for Liverpool. Basically, if you've seen how well he's performed for the Liverpool u21s, he's starting to perform as well at senior level. Very encouraging. Not exactly developing in leaps and bounds, but he's learning to use his obvious talent better.  I didn't watch him last night for the Spain u21's, but I hear [he did well.](https://twitter.com/davidjaca/status/375721988335366144) So far, his loan's been a good endorsement for the idea of getting these guys some games.

What I'd like to see now is 

1 - continued improvements in his decision-making. At times, he still over-thinks his next move and misses the opportunity. He also still cuts inside and fires a shot straight into a defender too often, though less so than before.

2 - A better ability to control games. He can definitely *influence* games, but to actually dictate the way his team plays and maintain his side's dominance is something he isn't really doing yet but is capable of. And considering that Almeria have been leading in the 80th minute of all 3 of their league games so far this season and have emerged from them with 2 points, they need someone to do that for them. 

Keeping in mind that he's played *3 games* on loan, I'm very happy with how he's doing. ",0,1378443698,null,0,false,0,cc2rjea,t3_1ltmgg,t1_cc2rjea,t3_1ltmgg,null,1429572831,26,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,26

I suggest going through all the tutorials in one night, watching the Scott M 101 video the next night and trying to recreate it. Then experiment. It is the Kerbal way. 

I promised myself that I wouldn't buy the game no matter what until I was able to launch a custom build vehicle from Kerbin, get it into LEO, set my trajectory for the Mun, enter LMO, land safely, explore on foot, exit the Mun's sphere of influence, renter a LEO and return to Kerbin safe and sound at least 30km from the base. It was a challenge, but totally worth it. 

The community at /r/KerbalSpaceProgram is crazy helpful and so diverse. The MOD scene for this game is crazy, too. Definitely worth the look-see.

Honestly, I'll often say to colleagues that the majority of people who shop with us have no idea what they're buying and have done no research.

Willian doesn't even play the same position as Wilshere, and in no way is an unproven Eriksen better than Wilshere.

This doesn't happen with not good players. You say his stats were almost as good as Bale's then discredit him for it. Its a thoroughly moronic argument that holds no weight.

One thing I have noticed as well is that he seems to have strengthened up considerably and he seems a bit quicker too. That was always something I was a bit worried about because he could seem a bit lightweight at times but he seems to be addressing that.

With regards to your second point about controlling games. You rarely see someone of Suso's age exhibit that ability at senior level, it's really something that comes with age, I fully expect Suso to develop that ability as his career progresses. 

It's going to be exciting to have him back next year if he carries on improving at this rate, it will basically be like getting a new signing.

There is no irony.  He didn't reduce the number of research engineers in the UK, the opposite he increased them.

If you are saying there is no difference between a production line assembly worker and an engineer, well to be honest I struggle to comprehend the mind behind such confusion.

If Tesco sacked all their till workers overnight, replacing them with automated tills, then said *we need more engineers, Tesco is now an R&amp;D firm* the fact they had just withdrawn their supermarket business wouldn't effect the credibility of their claims.

You do not create apprentice engineers by putting them on a production line attaching the plastic bits together which isn't economically viable for a machine to do.

Let's skip over all the sarcastic comments that show how cultured you are.  Also the fact you refuse to engage with the notion that he might have had many reasons for wanting to move production away.

&gt;Plenty of other companies have produced bagless vacuum cleaners for far less than Dyson do. Bladeless fans are available in Spain for 80 euros.

Where do those companies make their devices?  Isn't the fact that there are cheaper competitors likely to be a problem.  Yes he has a premium brand, but that only goes so far.

&gt;See above; you might want to wait on congratulating yourself in future before assuming that because you haven't considered all the information, it doesn't need considering. Or research.

And where are they made?  How are their sales doing.  Is the main market UK domestic or international.  Is it mostly EU or APAC or US?  Do they do much with SA?

&gt;Who appears to have given this a bit more thought than 'Wow, he made money, I haven't, his business acumen must be incredible'.

Honestly you don't appear to come across as someone who is an accomplished engineer or has ever made anything for manufacture.  You appear to come across as a bit of a small minded person when it comes to having a global business, you dismiss, outright, without consideration, anything that challenges your views, anything that the man behind the company says about why he moved operations.  I at least don't criticise him because I know I can not manufacture in the UK affordably.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; So having 'a fairly good idea of whats involved', and obviously feeling the pressures of working long hours for very little pay, why would you want to make others' lives any more difficult? 

Because, it isn't very little pay, it starts above the median and continues to be so.

If we were going to increase the teaching budget (ie more money from tax payers like me) then I'd much rather we have smaller classes, hire more teachers.

&gt;I don't see how you can be said to be earning a living any more authentic or inherently worthy than a teacher

I am not saying I am, the difference is I am not on strike or bitching about it at BBQs, I'm an adult and I accept the consequences of my life choices, without the grass is always greener on the other side syndrome.

&gt;I don't see either, how making teachers' lives more hard can be said to make anyone better off

Hah!  We aren't talking about that.  The teachers are striking because they have a pension which is a worry, defined contribution rather than defined benefit is the only way the government can avoid having a massive risk and future black hole in their budget.

Performance related pay?  Well this is what pretty much everyone else has.  Have you ever seen how hard it is to fire a teacher?  There is definitely a case for some reform here.

However my original comment wasn't about the strike, just someone I know at a BBQ having no concept of what it is like *in industry*.  The same person doesn't understand why they are never invited out on a weeknight either, mostly because one time they complained endlessly about been *left out in the cold* because the two of us she was coming to meet had to work later than planned, we only gave her 1 hours notice that we'd be stuck in the office till 8.

Now in relation to a strike.  When I see people who have:

* Incredible Job Security
* Low working hours
* Huge holidays
* Pensions unheard of in private sector, better than many public

Complaining that they might have performance linked pay bonuses.  I honestly have zero sympathy.

Where these people striking when Gordon Brown enacted a rule to steal a chunk of my pension every year?  Nope, because it didn't effect them, they with their defined benefit were protected.  Well if I have to be taxed for trying to save a tiny bit for my future, to share the burden of wealth transfer or whatever.  Why should a teacher get something so cast iron, that simply isn't fair.

So in short, I feel they are complaining that they might have to work almost, but not quite, as hard as the rest of us.",0,1378457457,null,0,false,0,cc2u296,t3_1lrv6q,t1_cc2u296,t1_cc2jfie,null,1429571653,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Every business has ""Fat"" that can be cut to increase profits. The idea is to cut as much fat as you can without killing the animal. But the fat is also the nice factor in a business. £15 a week for a staff water cooler is fat, but it also makes the place nicer to work in. If you work somewhere that is nice to staff, ultimately someone has made the decision that your happiness is more important than their personal profit. This might be altruistic or it might be good business sense, making them more money long term. Either way, in the face of fierce competition and shrinking profits, businesses will cut fat and whole limbs to survive.

Retail has fierce competition and soaring costs, it is a dying animal. The supermarkets cherry pick the best sellers, and the Internet wins on price and variety.

I know this for a fact because of friends and family who have gone through the stress of the procedure and know they need to 'dress up their circumstances'. It's partly because benefits these days seem so harsh, that you need to exaggerate to get what seems just.

It is a problem though because it exists as a phenomena and it gives ammo to the anti-welfare crowd.

If the conservatives managed to improve everyones living standards, didn't trample over workers rights, didn't go after the welfare bill and precided over a period of prolongued, sustainable economic growth then they would be arguing that the economy doesnt matter and that there should be more funding for other things like the arts and the environment.

They are never going to support the conservatives.

Ergo, for three years when there is no growth, they say that the only thing that matters is growth. When we get growth, then it is employment. When employment falls, its living standards. If living standards improved, they will just find something else.

Even when the Conservatives do something it agrees with, like same sex marriage, they will always highlight the achievements of everyone but the conservatives, who they will accuse of flip-flopping. When one of their ministers tries at long last to actually have a constructive discussion about sentancing and justice that it has been advocating for years, they engage in partisan point scoring and populist politician bashing before, in a small editorial four days later, giving begrudging support.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"No one said the Guardian isn't biased. The difference between them (along with right wing biased newspapers like the Telegraph) and DM is that they at least *try* to be reporting real news supported by real facts. The DM just makes shit up. DM doesn't report news, it *creates* news by misinforming the public.

I'm sure I would be described as left wing, but I do sometimes find myself agreeing with right wing newspapers like the Telegraph. Likewise, I don't always agree with what the Guardian has to say. Neither left or right is always right, both sides have good points to make.

Also, the Guardian (and the Telegraph) have their political leanings, but don't blindly support specific parties. For example, the Guardian is happy to tear Labour and the Lib Dems to shreds when they don't keep to the left. It's not about the party, it's about the policy. Obviously, the Tories go with lots of right wing policies and obviously the Guardian will point out the weaknesses in these policies. If you think that they would give Labour or the Lib Dems an easier time if they were in office, you would probably be right because it is likely that their policies are more left leaning. But if they move away from the left (as they have been for many years), then you can be sure they'll get just as much ire from the Guardian.

Any intelligent person should be using more than one source for their news, from all sides of the story. Reading articles from BBC, Guardian, Telegraph and other papers must all form part of a balanced view because they all report differing, but still valid views (EDIT: and of course, they will sometimes exaggerate beyond the facts and misreport issues, but by and large, they report backed by evidence that can be validated).

That's fine, it's because you're wrong. Lets see why:

&gt;UK is in steady decline with an economy built on services - ie. no real value.

This is an absurd claim, and all it really does is demonstrate your lack of understanding of economic matters. If services didn't have value then our 75% service based economy (along with that of every other mature economy) wouldn't be near the top of a big list of GDPs. Services have value because the market pays for them, so by the very fact that they generate lots of money they necessarily have value.

&gt;Russia has the landmass

The Netherlands doesn't, yet has a GDP per capita more than twice that of the Russians.

&gt;an economy built on their abundance of natural resources

Their economy is completely dependent on those natural resources. O&amp;G exports compose something silly like 70% of the Russian economy. Now *that's* an economy with serious structural problems.

&gt;They're new to capitalism but expect them to be one of the major powers of the 21st century whilst US &amp; UK becomes increasingly unimportant.

Oh please now you're just pulling things out of your arse. Grow up a little would you, that's an utterly ridiculous claim which completely ignores demographics and a host of other important issues. The idea that Russia will be anywhere near as powerful as the US within the next 50 years is laughable. Do you have any reasons beside just desire for claiming such a thing?

&gt;TL:DR The quicker the UK stops trying to play with the big boys the sooner we can focus on ourselves and leave the rest of the world to their games.

You and others don't seem to get this...we *are* one of the ""big boys"". Just because we're not the size of the world's only hyperpower doesn't mean we're somehow small and inconsequential, and anyone who thinks otherwise is simply uninformed (or willfully stupid, I suppose, if you prefer).",0,1378467662,null,0,false,0,cc2vba8,t3_1lt4cn,t1_cc2vba8,t1_cc2uozh,null,1429571052,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Now let's look at what  prominent firgues think the EU will ever become a super power. (you notice at this point the EU is referring to the UK and all the other countries in the EU)

&gt;Some do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status. ""The EU is not and never will be a superpower"" according to the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband.[73] Lacking a unified foreign policy and with an inability to project military power worldwide, the EU lacks ""the substance of superpowers,"" who by definition have ""first of all military reach [and] possess the capacity to arrive quickly anywhere with troops that can impose their government's will."".[74] EU parliamentarian Ilka Schroeder argues that conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian dispute see close EU involvement largely to compensate for European inability to project military power internationally.[75]

&gt;The Economist's Robert Lane Greene notes that the lack of a strong European military only exacerbates the lack of unified EU foreign policy and discounts any EU arguments towards superpower status, noting especially that the EU's creation of a global response force rivaling the superpower's (United States of America) is ""unthinkable.""[76] The biggest barrier to European superpowerdom is that European elites refuse to bring their postmodern fantasies about the illegitimacy of military ""hard power"" into line with the way the rest of the world interprets reality"" according to Soren Kern of Strategic Studies Group.[77]

&gt;Britain's Michael Howard has warned against the ""worry"" that many Europeans are pushing for greater EU integration to counterbalance the United States,[78] while Europe's total reliance on soft (non-military) power is in part because of its lack of a ""shared identity.""[79] While to some the European Union should be a ""model power"" unafraid of using military force and backing free trade, its military shortcomings argue against superpower status.[80]

On AskReddit when the thread about 
""what country stereotypes are actually true""
the answers that Brits give are just fucking cringeworthy..

Other countries give real answers, 
UK &amp; Canada pat themselves on the back for being polite and drinking tea and forming lines.

edit: pledge of allegiance is optional..

It's more of a ""you're late if you come in after the pledge"" kind of thing. 

And it's only at public schools which 99% of kids go to in the US.

&gt;Britain may be a small island, but I would challenge anyone to find a country with a prouder history, a bigger heart or greater resilience.
&gt;
&gt;Britain is an island that has helped to clear the European continent of fascism - and was resolute in doing that throughout World War Two.
&gt;
&gt;Britain is an island that helped to abolish slavery, that has invented most of the things worth inventing, including every sport currently played around the world, that still today is responsible for art, literature and music that delights the entire world.
&gt;
&gt;We are very proud of everything we do as a small island - a small island that has the sixth-largest economy, the fourth best-funded military, some of the most effective diplomats, the proudest history, one of the best records for art and literature and contribution to philosophy and world civilisation.
&gt;
&gt;For the people who live in Northern Ireland, I should say we are not just an island, we are a collection of islands. I don't want anyone in Shetland or Orkney to feel left out by this.

I think you might be right about the level of ignorance but I think there is a lot of 'don't care' involved. 

Some parents don't seem to understand that you need to actually teach kids stuff, it doesn't just magically appear in their brains. But often the parents were brought up that way themselves.

 Many parents literally *do not care*. I had a relative whose attitude toward kids was to just ""have a baby because you feel like it"" and once they were up to the toddler stage she had zero interest in parenting her kids.

This is going to be controversial but I think the worst parents are liable to be mentally ill or disabled in some ways. Not that being mentally ill or disabled makes you a bad parent, or that some perfectly healthy people aren't awful parents. It's just what I've seen. That relative I mention clearly has mental deficiencies, for example.",0,1378475938,null,0,1378476380,0,cc2x3uk,t3_1luex4,t1_cc2x3uk,t1_cc2w6xp,null,1429570142,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt; Because they're paying road tax? 

Whats road tax? 

Seriously, its VED a tax on CO2 which many car drivers also don't pay (see band A cars)

You'll want to look into how the roads are funded - you will learn there are only a few taxes that do directly contribute to roads/pavements - counsel tax and business rates being the primary ones. The bulk of these taxes do go back to the counsel for counsel funding, which inc roads and pavements.

All other taxes (ved/paye etc) go back into the central pot for redistribution elsewhere - from schools to the police to roads.

Also....VED does not cover the cost of the roads, and its cars that are the primary reason for damage to said road. And even if it did cover the cost, many forget that cyclists also own cars (around 80%) which they are nice enough to leave at home not clogging up roads/taking parking spaces/using fuel etc...

And because VED does not cover the cost of the road have you thought about where the rest of the funding comes from?.....you can thank the collective tax payer for subsidizing the roads.

So by any logical reasoning, cyclists are as entitled (if not more so as they use the road by right not by licence) to use the ""public"" highway. And the entitlement some drivers show if down to simple ignorance based on a tax that was abolished in 1937.

&gt;Britain may be a small island, but I would challenge anyone to find a country with a prouder history, a bigger heart or greater resilience.
&gt;
&gt;Britain is an island that has helped to clear the European continent of fascism - and was resolute in doing that throughout World War Two.
&gt;
&gt;Britain is an island that helped to abolish slavery, that has invented most of the things worth inventing, including every sport currently played around the world, that still today is responsible for art, literature and music that delights the entire world.
&gt;
&gt;We are very proud of everything we do as a small island - a small island that has the sixth-largest economy, the fourth best-funded military, some of the most effective diplomats, the proudest history, one of the best records for art and literature and contribution to philosophy and world civilisation.
&gt;
&gt;For the people who live in Northern Ireland, I should say we are not just an island, we are a collection of islands. I don't want anyone in Shetland or Orkney to feel left out by this.

Mhmm...

&gt;Are you comfortable with that?

I am a little uncomfortable with the ease of committing things like identity fraud and what have you on the internet, as well as for little cliques to attack each other with information and the like, but I ultimately feel that this is an issue for legislation. My home can be broken into by burglars. If there was a widespread trend of having homes which were completely inaccessible without the key with no means of breaking in though that would cause innumerable problems (what if someone passed out, what if someone has locked some innocent people in, what if someone forgets their keys, what if someone is storing weapons in there etc). I want laws to deter burglars not perfect locks.

We are now reaching a stage where the information version of unbreakable into homes - we're not there yet but by god are people freaking out about the fact we're not. I don't think it is right that people should have the certainty of hiding something no matter what it is they want to hide - I think that within the law people should be able to investigate hidden things, not just potential terrorism or pedophile rings, but those are clearly some of the more emotive examples of things viable to investigate.

The internet has provided lots of people - governments, organisations, businesses, individuals - power they didn't have previously. Interesting a lot of this power to ""surveil"" only exists insofar as people are unwilling to forgo the additional power they got from the internet. Anyway, its natural that a big power struggle was going to emerge over the internet. 

I think the real concern is not that power struggle - on both sides you find good people (people who genuinely want to protect bank details from criminals, people trying to prevent terrorist attacks, people protecting their countries from espionage, people who maybe misguidedly believe in the potential to engineer some sort of techno-utopia) and bad people (people who are trying to cause damage, physical, psychological or economic to others, thieves, corrupt people who want to cover their tracks).

What concerns me is the disillusionment and distrust that has built up against the governing institutions of society because I worry about how such distrust can be abused by people who don't have those who are distrustful's best interests at heart, and because I think there is a kind of positive feedback loop of distrust that can build up in these conditions in which fear of tyranny becomes a self fulfilling prophecy through either successful rebellion (most successful rebellion seems to end in tyranny) or through the efforts to prevent or quell rebellion.",0,1378481100,null,0,false,0,cc2ypdv,t3_1luf78,t1_cc2ypdv,t1_cc2yem1,null,1429569400,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I saw Richard Herring's [Hitler Moustache](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwEi5Dpq6zs) stand up a few years ago in Bristol. At one point he spoke about groups of people who fear/don't like/hate immigrants and/or think they're a scourge and/or want them to go home because they think they're a drain on resources etc. *etc* (mainly he spoke about the BNP).

Herring asked everyone in the audience to raise a hand. Then he asked anyone who wasn't British to put their hand down. Then anyone who had at least one parent who wasn't born in Britain to lower a hand. Then put your hand down if a grandparent(s) wasn't born in Britain. Then a great grandparent.

At that point out of a room of a couple of hundred, only a handful had a hand in the air.

For starters, you say that the BBC's bias is due to BBC employees being vetted by MI5, but in the article you linked to support that it quite clearly refers to the 70s and 80s, not the present day. Indeed, they recently ran a story on the incompetence of MI5 throughout history.

Saying that the BBC is an extention of GCHQ is quite clearly ridiculous and I hope you see that. In fact, they did quite extensively report on the Snowden allegations and there is currently a leading story on the site about UK and US spy angencies cracking encryptions. However the BBC were constrained from going too far with those stories because the Guardian had all the exclusives. I would also argue that their NHS coverage is generally balanced and they have devoted extensive time to claims that the current government is gravely damaging the health service. 

Also, you have to bear in mind the BBC's precarious position. The way it handles this position is largely why it is called biased by both sides (I can find as many studies or claims as you have, if not more, that say the BBC is a left wing mouthpiece). As a public service it has a responsibility to check the government, but also has to be mindful of not pissing off the government too much (and this is true no matter who is in power). In addition they need to keep the opposition broadly on-side for when they come into power. Management is scared to death of being seen as biased as they don't like burning bridges (you could argue that this constitutes a bias towards institution, which is a defendable position, but institution does not equal right wing).

As such, it has a tendency to violently over-correct when accused of bias by major political figures, giving ammunition to both sides who say it is a biased institution. In truth however, the BBC is neither particularly left or right leaning - it's just a bit lurchy between the two at times.

For housing benefit, if you have 1 too many rooms, you lose 14% of your benefit, if you have 2 too many, it's 25%. Even if the council doesn't have a smaller house available to move you into. For LHA your benefit is capped at what it would be for a house with the number of rooms you should have. These should work out to be similar deductions.

The formula for counting the number of rooms is:

* one bedroom for a couple
* one bedroom for a person aged 16 or over
* one bedroom for two children aged under 16 of the same sex
* one bedroom for two children aged under 10 (boys and girls are expected to share a room)
* one extra bedroom if you or your partner needs an overnight carer to stay.

You don't get any extra bedrooms if you share custody of a child, are separated but not formally divorced, or are a couple but have different rooms (for whatever reason).

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"It's been called a Bedroom Tax, but what it actually is that if a family receiving housing benefits has more bedrooms than they ""need"", their benefits are cut by a certain percentage based on how many spare bedrooms you have. And by ""need"", the government deems:

1. One bedroom for an adult couple or per single adult.

2. One bedroom for two children under 10, of either gender.

3. One bedroom per two children over 10 and under 16 of the same gender.

If you have a bedroom for a child who only lives in your house at weekends because the other parent has the child during the week, that's a spare bedroom. If you have separate bedrooms for your 9 year old daughter and 8 year old son, then one of those is ""spare"". If you and your spouse sleep in separate bedrooms because your spouse has a medical condition requiring specialist equipment, one of those bedrooms is spare.

Basically, you get housing benefits cut by a sizable chunk if you're divorced with shared custody of children (and your ex has claimed exemption), if you have separate bedrooms for younger children or children of the same gender over 10, or if you need a separate bedroom from your spouse for medical reasons.

None of which seems fair.

So the poorest need separate bedrooms for each child to allow then to achieve their potential, according to Gove, who is part of the same government who would deny struggling families the rent money they need if they followed that advice.",0,1378486426,null,0,false,0,cc30j7y,t3_1lunkp,t1_cc30j7y,t1_cc2zvgt,null,1429568543,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,william-in-the-hague,null,null,"&gt; I think it's you who is biased and you're really being quite inconsistent. For starters, you say that the BBC's bias is due to BBC employees being vetted by MI5, but in the article you linked to support that it quite clearly refers to the 70s and 80s, not the present day.

Paxman, Lyse Doucet, Michael Buerk, and anyone else that started in the 80s would have passed security vetting. Are you that naive to think that a culture like that just stopped and corrected itself immediately? I would go further and presume it carries on with better secrecy.

&gt; Saying that the BBC is an extention of GCHQ is quite clearly ridiculous and I hope you see that.

Why? They run PR cover for Israel, every major war, and I guess you don't know your history because the BBC was conceived to be a propaganda machine.

&gt; In fact, they did quite extensively report on the Snowden allegations and there is currently a leading story on the site about UK and US spy angencies cracking encryptions.

I disagree if only because it's already been [bumped off the front page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/) despite only breaking last night. Previous reporting has almost exclusively been US-focused. Where are the UK officials that have been dragged in front of a hostile audience to account for themselves? No tough questions have been asked. For one of the world's best resourced (supposed) journalistic organisations, one with intimate knowledge of telecommunications, why haven't they managed any sort of scoop especially in regards to ""the national interest""? Why couldn't they see the pedophile in plain sight—SIR Jimmy Savile.

The lead story should not be ""cracking encryption"" anyway, but that GCHQ/NSA are engaging in covert industrial sabotage. Also, one swallow doesn't make a summer and they should be judged on what gets repeated. 

&gt; However the BBC were constrained from going too far with those stories because the Guardian had all the exclusives.

They could have forced the issue with official protagonists. They've sat idly by. The BBC shapes news, doesn't create it.

&gt; Also, you have to bear in mind the BBC's precarious position.

It's not precarious. They can say what they like with no economic consequences because their truths aren't going to piss of advertisers, so the theory goes. 

&gt; You are seeing what you want to see.

It's a charge I lay at your feet. I gave broad ranging objective appraisals from academia, but the fawning coverage of anything royal should be enough. You may disagree with my position but it's ridiculous to call it ridiculous. Think about that, GHCQ installing backdoors and vulnerabilities (ie' sabotaging) the software that keeps your bank transactions secure. You should be fucking pissed, the BBC should be running headlines every 15 mins. I doubt that's happening on BBC news. The 6pm dose of misinformation is on soon, I don't watch the shit but I'll make an exception today. I'll be back in 30 minutes having expected the word ""sabotage"" mentioned.

A classic example of this is how the US manages to spend vastly greater proportions of its money on healthcare, and yet many of the most vulnerable struggle to afford it, whereas we with our NHS spend much less.

The issue in the 90s was how fast banks moved to foreclose.  They also didn't really care about getting the best available price, ultimately no one was incentivised to minimise the loss when liquidating the security.

The real problem is most people I know don't keep many months wage in cash savings, because they can't afford too.   The problem is can't afford to includes things that aren't really needed at all.  One mate spent over £500 (on credit card) buying a new TV etc whilst he was in debt, to apparently save money... Because he would go out less.

If people on mass behave like that (I know I am a freak amongst my peers for having a pension, ISA and other retirement savings, rather than an iPad 4) then one little shock and their life falls apart.  Luckily, the laws have changed since the 90s and mortgage companies tend to view eviction as a last course of action.

So despite these problems, increase in rates, lack of personal savings, I think we will probably be OK for the most part.

&gt;Asked what had worried him about Mr Zaloom’s articles, he said: “The fact that Kinnan has mentioned the ideologies of anarchism and individualism on this blog.”

&gt;Mr Szemalikowski added: “I must do something. In the last year he has become more and more enchanted by anti-establishment ways of thinking and has even said that there is an inherent risk that every government is corrupt.

&gt;""I phoned Glasgow to warn them what sort of person they were dealing with, to advise them that this person thinks thoughts like these, and they could then make an informed decision. I am duty bound to do that.”

Now. I'm a dirty leftie, and I often gnash my teeth when I sense there is a prevailing attitude amongst certain interested groups that 'the end of ideological conflict' has arrived - i.e. that the end of the Cold War proved that capitalism isn't just the *best* system, but the *only* one. I know that this is not universal consensus nor do I feel some conspiracy, but I think there is evidence of its presence, and I think this Headteacher is demonstrating that when someone in power does think this way, he is able to fuck someone's life up for appearing to not accept the status quo.

Calling Glasgow University about this should get him sacked. What a cunt to try and ruin his prospects.

* Murder of three family members in France.
* BBC head of trust scandal.
* And it's good bye to the Summer.

Not looking good so far, never even made the headlines.

&gt; G20...

Video roll: Almost void of information, just talking heads (Cameron/Putin/Obama), signing off with shots of refugees. Why isn't the BBC demanding to see the evidence? 7 minutes coverage.

&gt; Murder of three family members in France...

...a family affair about inheritance? What? So little national interest beyond scandal? 2nd on the bill? 3 minutes coverage.

&gt; Misleading MPs regarding payoffs 

2 minute coverage.

&gt; Some rape issue.

Wasn't paying attention. 30 seconds.

&gt; UNITE labour rigging.

20 seconds.

&gt; Coronation Street alleged pedo

Another personal scandal that doesn't impact the life of the general public. Not even a verdict. I see this as highbrow tabloid smut. 2 min.

&gt; Reminder of the top story: Putin.

Are we that forgetful?

&gt; Winter Olympics 2020

News of no news—no country has been picked as the location. Tokyo promo and fear mongering regarding nuclear accident. Madrid—fragile economy... bit scary. ""In contrast..."" Istanbul is better... but protest crackdown. 3

&gt; Tougher GCSEs

Delayed... so the news isn't happening. 30 secs.

&gt; Train crash in Spain...

Phone evidence. 2min.

&gt; Internet Porn..

Right... ""police need more to be done about child porn"". So... pro-surveillance propaganda? Only 20% of first contact with children is done by internet... what!? So real life threat is 80%!! Obviously the BBC didn't say that. ""Modern world needs more methods to protect innocence"". Don't make me sick they who gave safe haven to Sir Jimmy Savile. 3-4min.

Yes, I was outside today. Temperatures... what the shit fuck no way!? Vineyards!? [...] A live broadcast from some fucking field to say 15 words about the dark nights ahead! Are you shitting me!!!?!?!!!!! 3 mins.

Yes, the BBC carries stories without great importance to most people but that generate public interest. Sue them - they're meant to be providing value to the public at large, and this is what the public at large cares about.

You're being very one sided in their coverage of Syria. Twice this week they've had the main headline being Russia demanding evidence for the chemical weapons attack claims, and they were generally congratulatory (as far as the BBC ever gets overtly editorialised) over parliament's rejection of military intervention in Syria, running a story as the headline saying the country overwhelmingly backed the decision. You should have watched Newsnight after the vote - they (including Paxo) were pretty anti-intervention.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"It's very complicated physics that no layman could understand, I certainly don't properly. But the gist I get is that you can create particles from energy in the right environment. In the same way that when matter an anti-matter collide they explode in a burst of energy, energy itself can decay back into particles - 2 particles in fact. One particle is matter and one is anti matter. Normally they will hit each other and annihilated back into energy but you can separate them. Those particles are then physically linked through some very complicated quantum mechanics. It's called Quantum Entanglement. If something happens to one particle the same thing happens to the other even though the other particle may be separated by a million miles. 

Thus if you intercept one particle (or group of particles) which represents the data then it will change the particles. In quantum mechanics simply observing particles will change their state and this will change the other particle(s) identically. The other particles are kept in the computer of the person who owns the data and these particles will change when data is intercepted telling the owner of the data. There's no way I know of for GCHQ to get around this. 

This is a massively simplified explanation which doesn't go into the reasons for it all (because I don't really understand the details) and I may have made mistakes (I hope not) as it was off the top of my head but the basic idea is that it's not based on computer code. It's based on the physical state of the data being transferred. Unless you change the fundamental laws of physics it's impossible to crack.

Read his autobiography.

There's a lot of reasons he moved the factory out of the UK, and ""another ivory back scratcher"" (as someone else has put it) isn't one of them.

Off the top of my head:

 - Britain had at the time a very strong currency. This is great for people going on holiday - it means you get a lot of foreign currency for your money - but it's terrible if you want to export vacuum cleaners because it makes everything you sell very expensive. The only way you can hope to sell a damn thing is to reduce your wholesale price - at one point he'd practically had to reduce the wholesale price to cost price just to export anything at all.
 - Nobody manufactures anything that complicated from raw materials. Something like a vacuum cleaner consists of a lot of little parts, many of which are manufactured by a third-party company (injection moulding equipment is incredibly expensive; it's often a lot more cost-effective to outsource the moulding and just do the parts assembly yourself, which is precisely how Dyson started out). Problem: Most of the companies who have the capacity to supply the components you need are in the Far East - there quite simply isn't anyone in the UK who could. Sea freight to the UK typically takes around 12 weeks and puts you at the mercy of customs officials. Which means you need to forecast exactly what you will need 3-4 months into the future (get it wrong and you either can't produce enough to meet demand or you wind up stockpiling vacuum cleaners).
 - NIMBY-ism. He needed to build a larger factory but was facing a nightmare of planning because nobody wanted the factory nearby. Frankly, after something like 25 years of trying to get the product off the ground (seriously, it really did take that long), the man's finally experiencing a bit of success - can you blame him for saying ""You know what? Fuck this. You don't want the factory, you don't have to have it. But I still need the factory, so I'll just build it elsewhere"".",0,1378491266,null,0,false,0,cc32axn,t3_1lrn4u,t1_cc32axn,t1_cc2hovd,null,1429567717,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Actually killing someone makes a difference to the sentencing. 

&gt; Satnav driver who killed cyclist spared jail 

Assumed this was the one you were referring to. Point stands 240 hours on unpaid work for careless driving based on brief distraction.

&gt; Mother who killed cyclist 'took her eyes off the road for almost 20 seconds

Different country. Didn't cause death. 

&gt; 300 hours community service for killing a cyclist for the second time

The previous event *was* 20 years ago. 

&gt; Driver eating a sandwich convicted of carelss driving after kiling a cyclist 

Seems largely consistent with #2.

&gt;  police are considering a charge of involuntary manslaughter 

Police consider lots of things. They wouldn't do this against a driver because there are specific driving offences they can use which are a lot easier to prove.

* The head is viewed from different angles
* The flowers are completely different (not only are they clearly different types, but they're covered with ""circuit"" designs in the print)
* The screwdriver/dagger design is very different (how much of the sonic is incorporated; whether the screwdriver tip is opened/closed; the design of the hilt, quillions, and blade...)
* The text is different: ""DELETION B 4 DISHONOR ..."" versus what appears to be simply ""DELETE""

I don't think it would have mattered if he had shot either one, in regards to stopping Rassilon's plan.  Shooting the Master in that unstable body might have killed him and terminated the beacon in his head, but his role in the plan had already been accomplished - the portal was already open. Let's also not forget that in the previous episode, he had transformed most of the population of Earth into duplicates of himself - even if the original had died then, there were still billions more that presumably would have still filled the role.

I hardly think he could have taken down Rassilon with the gun. Rassilon was one of the founders of the Time Lords, not to mention one of their most powerful. All of the Time Lords' most powerful artifacts and inventions were created by or attributed to him - I hardly think a bullet or six would have done much.

When I was growing up the dining table was right next to the living room with the TV on or people talking so I couldn't work there. I shared a bedroom and there was no desk or work surface, so I had to do my homework on the floor. My pen/pencil punched through the paper sometimes because I had nothing suitable to rest on, and I had back problems by the age of 12 because I couldn't get comfortable. Not to mention I would often be disturbed by my brother bringing friends over or going on his playstation or whatnot. After a while I simply stopped bothering and my academic performance suffered.

Fast forward to university and I built myself a desk the size of a single bed and insisted I have a second bedroom to use as my office when I moved into a flat with my girlfriend, because I want to make up for workspace I never had when I was growing up.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"IMO, that sums up TV licencing. I've told this story before, so I'll post the abridged version:

About 4.5 years ago, I decided to become a cord-cutter. Cancelled my Virgin Media TV subscription, and decided to go the extra step, and stop watching live tv, to see if I could live with catch-up services. I'd just renewed my licence for the next year.

After six months of watching very little tv, I decided to cancel the remaining units / blocks on my licence. The first person I spoke to told me that owning a PC required a TV licence.

The second said that buying an iPhone counted as an installation; that because the iPhone could - in theory - be used to watch live broadcasts, it required a licence. *Furthermore, because it was my second call, my details had been ""logged"" and if I failed to renew my licence when it was due, I would be ""investigated"" for ""Conspiracy to not pay your TV licence""*

A few hours later, having gone through the various bits 'n' pieces of legislation, I send individual copies of the letter I'd typed up, via recorded delivery, to the head of TV licencing, andthe head of the BBC.

Within six weeks I'd got a full apology from TVL, a refund, and written confirmation I wouldn't' be contacted again, for three years. The BBC never responded.

Three years to the day? Letter from TVL asking if my ""Circumstances"" had changed.",0,1378504572,null,0,false,0,cc37cfu,t3_1lvj1u,t1_cc37cfu,t1_cc373wz,null,1429565245,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I wouldn't consider myself ethically bound by this. If they offered me a position I'd feel free to defraud or damage their business in any way I saw fit. 

However although I would feel ethically free to, I wouldn't carry out any fraud or theft. This wouldn't be for their sake. It would be for mine. In the same way, a good electrician with a bad employer wouldn't install dangerous or shoddy wiring, because he wouldn't want to get used to poor practice.

Instead, I'd use it as an opportunity to hone my customer service and sales skills at their expense. Good salespeople who want repeat business don't sell people stuff they don't want. ""I recommend you don't take out our extended warranty; it isn't very good value....""

true,dothecreepuhh,null,null,"I got BT TV recently because I wanted a Freeview+ box and it worked out cheaper to get it through BT at £5 a month than it did to buy one outright. It's not too bad in my opinion. If you've ever had Sky and  want to compare it (I say this because I went from having Sky at my old house to this), it's a little less impressive and a bit slower/not as slick but it essentially does the same job. It has most of the same features, I can pause/rewind/whatever live TV, I can series link recordings for shows I watch regularly etc. 

The other features are *okay*, I am hoping they're going to devlop them further as they seem to be paying into this now with the launch of BT Sport etc. I like that I can access the on-demand apps through the box rather than my laptop/xbox and it works pretty well (they've got ITV Player, BBC iPlayer, 4oD and Demand 5)- I haven't really used the Box Office stuff much, but I was pretty impressed at the selection. They've got quite a few recent films etc, but I might just be impressed at that feature because I'm in Pembrokeshire and we've got fuck all else.

We're from the states, and arrived in Edinburgh on the 31st. We scheduled so many flat viewings, and many would cancel before we even had a chance to see them because someone else had already put in a deposit/signed a lease. One place we went to, we got there 25 mins early, and were second in line to a couple looking for their friend. They ended up going up, and didn't come down for a while, and then the guy showing it came down and said they'd decided to put in a deposit for their friend. Lastly, we went to viewings where 10-15 people were viewing at the same time. Just really crazy. I've never had such a hard time seeing places. My experience in the states was usually if you had an interest in a place, the landlord or agency would show it to you at your earliest convenience, but here it seemed that things were days out or the following week, not to mention available to move in a week, weeks, or a month from the viewing. My advice is to plan ahead, and definitely, definitely, line up viewings before you arrive in the city. That way when you call the day you arrive you won't be told that no viewings aren't available till the end of the week or the next week. You'll be able to go as soon as you get here.

Oh, and second lastly, you may want to be prepared to be asked to put down 3-6 months rent in advance.

As to: 
&gt;  There's no arguing with the fact that people who get degrees earn, on average, more over their life time. As an individual, if you can you should.

We don't have a crystal ball, but I would not be surprised if in 60 years time we will (if we're still around) find that the current ""university generation"" will not have done quite as well as they expected (based on expectations set by school/government/society) - especially in the case of the more vocational degrees (tentatively excepting medicine/dentistry/vet med/etc). The effect of a degree on earnings potential very much depends on the sector of work, and for some it can be advantageous to go directly into work and get 3+ years of experience, contacts, and pay rises, and avoid £30-40k of debt. 

Because of the current glut of graduates, degrees in general have been devalued relative to their status 10+ years ago. 

University has begun to be seen as a natural continuation of school for most people. The amount of commitment represented by a degree is apparently reduced - by which I mean that 10-20 years ago, anyone graduating with a degree in Maths would have been assumed to have **loved** the subject enough to eschew 3 years of earnings, of real adult life, to study it. Now, the perception might be more towards ""this person did maths because they were good at it at school"", and they didn't want to miss out on uni. It's a continuum, obviously, and I would not suggest that the latter case applies to all students now, just as the former didn't apply to all students a generation ago - it could in fact be argued that a generation ago, some of those who went to uni didn't go because they loved the subject, but because they were rich and it was the ""done thing"". Though the number of graduates was low enough that this probably wouldn't affect graduate employability as much as the analogous situation (everyone goes to uni because it's the ""done thing"") might now.

To re-iterate and summarise: The oft-repeated statistic that ""you'll earn more money as a graduate"" is based on the earnings accrued by graduates who lived in an age where higher education was a rarity, not the norm. It is inarguable that supply and demand will (and has already begun to) lower graduate salaries and force graduates into non-graduate (or ""unskilled"") jobs. The forecasting ability of the statistic at the start of this paragraph is thus throw into doubt! It is dangerous. It tells school leavers that all degrees are equal, that all universities are equal, and that they can be entitled to a higher standard of living after paying £30-40k to study any degree. There are false expectations, bad for the individual, and a false sense of entitlement, bad for society. An Event Management/Fashion/Photography/Tourism/Media Studies degree is, objectively, unlikely to match the earnings of a Law/STEM/Medicine degree. For the former degrees, most students would likely be better off going directly into work in the sector and building experience. 

My feeling overall is that students should have the choice to do as they wish, and should not be judged by outsiders for their choices (""they went into the military at 16? must have been poor or shared a room!""). But I also feel that students must be given clear facts and be able to make an educated choice for themselves, about going to university. Compared to 10-20 years ago it feels like uni. has gone from opt-in to opt-out.

But they have remained better than not having one. As degrees devalue the position of people without them gets even worse. The gap between graduate/non-graduate will get larger even as graduates earn less as every graduate in an 'unskilled' job is an unskilled worker with no job at all.

true,stop-chemistry-time,null,null,"&gt; But they have remained better than not having one. 

Only if you have a job and you're in the right industry. Someone straight out of uni with an Events Management degree can expect to fetch a lower salary than someone who went in straight after school and got promoted to a supervisor position within 3 years. Unfortunately for many of us, there's no formal ""graduate bonus"" on salaries (just loan deductions...). 

Arguably, some degrees are 3+ years of training to work in what is *de facto* an unskilled industry. In the saturated job marketplace, it's quite difficult to use those nebulous ""transferable skills"" to blag a management job...

&gt;As degrees devalue the position of people without them gets even worse. The gap between graduate/non-graduate will get larger even as graduates earn less as every graduate in an 'unskilled' job is an unskilled worker with no job at all.

I think your statement is based on the fundamentally flawed assumption that employers favour degree-holders over those who lack degrees for ""unskilled"" jobs. That is patently not the case. Graduates are about as likely to be favoured as to be told that they're overqualified.

I also think your conclusion - that the gap will get larger - might be incorrect in realistic conditions.

In principle, if 99% of students went to university, I would expect the remaining 1% to have great difficulty finding jobs at all. Due to a shift in cultures, graduates would obviously be filling all jobs (""unskilled"" as well), and the non-graduates would be viewed as lesser citizens. They would have difficulty finding employment and the gap would be **massive**. But this is clearly an unrealistic situation (I hope...).

Back in the real world, I think that we could come to a conclusion which I will sketch out below. We will assume that the ""number of workers"" remains constant and they are split into ""graduates"" and ""non-graduates"".

 * There will be a large number of graduates who saturate the market for graduate jobs 
 * Therefore graduate salaries (for graduate jobs) will fall (in real terms)
 * Our remaining graduates and our non-graduates will now be competing for ""unskilled"" jobs. There is no inherent bias towards either graduates or non-graduates for these jobs. There are just as many people available for these jobs as before (some non-graduates have just become unemployed graduates), so the supply/demand is unaffected. Graduates may demand higher wages, but let's assume that employers do not capitulate - they have no reason to, there are plenty of other people seeking jobs. The overall unemployment level in this class remains constant, divided pretty much equally between graduates and non-graduates.
 * So ""unskilled"" salaries remain the same. 
 * But now we have graduates working in the ""unskilled"" class - so the overall average graduate salary (as in, ""salary earned by graduates"") will fall.
 * The net effect is a narrowing of the gap

This ""model"" obviously neglects a lot of factors (eg non-graduates getting graduate level jobs, later career effects, elasticity, etc), but hopefully demonstrates why the salary gap between graduates and non-graduates will fall when degrees are devalued, with all other things being equal. It is notable that this apparent increase in ""equality"" is to the detriment of the graduates and to no worker's benefit (in monetary terms, at least).

true,thenotoriousSIG,num22,,"Just because Sandro got injured doesn't mean he's a bad player now. Look at glass bones RVP, one of, if not the best, strikers in the league after all of those injuries. If you think Paulinho right now is better than Sandro was last season, then you don't realize just how god damn amazing Sandro is.

And I'd argue that Dembélé is looking poor because his role in the starting XI has shifted forward, which in my opinion has hampered his ability to drive forward with the ball rather than recieve the ball high up the pitch and try to make a defense splitting pass. It's just not his game.

I watched most of the Confederations Cup and while Paulinho was fantastic, he hasn't impressed me this season. He plays little risk, low reward passing and looks to shoot from too far out. Once he settles in and starts attempting riskier and higher rewarding things maybe he'll look better.

Before Sandro was injured last year, Him and Dembéle were our best players. Forget Bale, Sandro and Mousa dominated the midfield. Good on Gareth for stepping up when we needed him most but he wasn't our best player that first half of the season. He doesn't hold a candle to Hurricane Sandy and The Moose.

true,ser_feliz,null,null,"Heya!  I'm going to Bmouth on the 16th to start my Computing course! I can maybe help by telling you what I've found out...and compare it to London, cause I live in South London at the moment

People in Bmouth won't have a heavy strong accent like northerners, it will have a southern lilt (think a London accent but a little softer), but you will come to terms with it when you've been around it a while.

Nightlife in Bmouth looks good, freshers program for this year is IMMENSE they have varied nights from indie/rock to cheese and even more underground stuff by the looks of things...I'm sure locals will have more info on this

I wouldn't recommend going to London Uni, my friends who've stayed in London have a pathetic freshers week and everything is SO expensive, they've made few new friends and London Unis don't have the campus lifestyle like Bmouth and up north. It's almost like going to a bigger college...there isn't much difference. 

London is SO expensive, a lot of my friends still live at home and if they are moving out this yr they are paying in excess of £5000 for the year (for uni halls) (I'm paying ~£4000 for first year uni halls) they are staying right in central London though (nr Regents Park) so they could have gotten cheaper residences. Drinks on a night out can be £5.00+ in a nightclub, travel can be £5.00+ (tube there and night buses home) and entry can get to £15 in the westend...if you are smart and get in guestlists you can get in for free. London is fabulous but if you go to Bournemouth you are about a 1hr/2hr train ride to the center of London, so you can journey to London fairly easily and stay in a cheap hotel in outer London and go out and experience everything

I will miss the immediacy of London and how everything is on my doorstep (or max 1hr away) I have gone on great nights out and have managed to keep up with underground trap scene. The culture is amazing, with museums and galleries so nearby.

I've grown up in London near some high crime areas, so anywhere that isn't London seems like a quaint little hamlet with no serious harm...locals may be able to help better with that

I can keep in contact with you and let you know what I feel about Bmouth uni and the area as I go along, feel free to PM me! Sorry I couldn't be much help with Bmouth...but hopefully I've made up with the London info!

* Introduction of the minimum wage - population control - any other wage, you are denied from working for.

* Devolution for Scotland and Wales - It would have happened anyway.

* Progress in the NI peace process - It would have happened anyway.

* Real terms growth of 18% in average incomes over 1997-2006 - all thanks to the previous conservative government!  Gordon Brown immediately went about selling off half the countries gold reserves at the **bottom** of the market to downramp the price and save JP Morgan.

And in the mean time, the government needs to invest in more housing all across the country, ensuring all new build developments have housing of different sizes to suit a variety of different families. And also they should relax laws about building on gardens in built up areas and class certain types of satellite village (as in, those who have almost been swallowed by urban sprawl but still stand apart) as something other than ""open countryside"".

The government are going about this all the wrong way. They're making things harder for people struggling the most instead of making positive changes to help them. All stick and no carrot.

They need to invest money in job creation - encourage STEM fields and manufacturing through temporary tax breaks. Encourage individuals to start their own businesses through grants and low interest loans, offer mentoring and support in things like accounting and taxes to help small businesses get off the ground and succeed and ultimately reach a point where they can employ a couple of people. If 100 peoplemstart small businesses, that's 100 fewer people on JSA, 100 fewer people looking for the few available jobs. It's 100 small businesses spending money in the local economy to buy the supplies they need, hiring couriers they need to get their product to customers, and generally boosting the economy; and a year down the line, it's 100 businesses potentially able to hire another 100 people.

Pharma as an angle: I suppose I can see that, although I suspect legalisation would provide an opportunity rather than a threat. Alcohol companies: yes, I can certainly see that. 

MDMA as an example: it was originally designed - by Pfizer, if I remember correctly - as an appetite suppressant. 

The point I'm trying to make is that politicians will try hardest to prepetuate themselves, not a putative status quo. If there's political capital in it, they'll do it. You say that people tend to believe decriminalisation is a good thing, and strictly speaking that's true. You'll find, if you look a little deeper, that the approval levels for decriminalisation tends to go up as age goes down. Conversely, people's likelihood to vote goes up as age goes up.

Depressingly enough, the high street is increasingly composed of rows of tattooists, hair stylists and laundromat businesses. Everything else has been whittled away by much larger businesses which have decimated local competition and cornered the market. There is no hope for independent groceries, butchers, or bakers to make an honest wage in the face of competition from national entities like Tescos that provide everything these businesses do while undercutting them.

The key issue at the heart of the employment situation in the UK though is that the most competitive businesses (the ones that provide the best service and value i.e. Supermarket chains, Amazon etc) are all large scale businesses that turn profits by squeezing the bottom line as low as physically possible. This means the rank and file workers at the bottom of the employment ladder will always get the short end of the stick for the benefit of the company shareholders and execs.

These companies are impossible to dislodge as they provide a concentration of services that were previously doled out amongst an assortment of other businesses; grocers, electronics, bakeries, entertainment, alcohol and a variety of other goods and services have been collected into large scale installations that we're dependent on to provide the material goods society depends on.

Now that the grip of these businesses on the domestic market of the UK has solidified there is practically no way to shake them off and return to a compartmentalized model of small to medium sized businesses with a variety of competitors.

The direct area around the University is quite nice, it's mainly housing with lots of students and local families.  10-15 minutes on bus will get you from the University to Bournemouth center.  From there you have trains heading out to Southampton (45min) &amp; London (2hr) or a bus route to Salisbury(45-60min).   Surrounding area we have the beach, New Forest and Purbecks(http://www.visit-dorset.com/about-the-area/areas-to-visit/swanage-and-purbeck)

Some areas are high crime spots but not usually violent crime, mainly drug, prostitution and theft.  There are some drunken fights very late at night outside of the bars and clubs, but there is normally a Police presence to stop it getting out of hand.  I have lived in one of the worst areas and never had any problems. Most of the area is safe.

Nightlife is good if you like mainstream clubs. Theres not much in the way of alternative (Jazz, Blues, Metal, Folk) bars and clubs,  though you will find random live bands playing different music.  Just not on a regular basis.  

Worth pointing out there is a surprisingly large Portuguese and Brazilian community in Bournemouth.


In addition to /u/ser_feliz comments on London, i'll add that most people i've spoken with who have moved from London to Bournemouth have spoken of the change in pace.  London is very huried, where as Bournemouth is more relaxed.

At the wage and conditions you're offering. Pay peanuts, get monkeys.

I don't think you could get a qualified person from Germany or Sweden for ""a lot less"", unless they want an easy job while they sort out their new life in the UK. Do you want to attract the type of people who will cut and run after they've got their few years of experience?

Once upon a time, employers were happy to get a fresh graduate to mould into the employee they want. It seems to me that you're not happy with putting on a bit of training for your new hire. You're just claiming all of the benefit and none of the cost while blaming it on the education system. I'll bet that, somewhere along the line, you received on the job training. The education system has never equipped people to do a specific job. All it has ever done is give people general life skills and a grounding in whatever subject they study. You're not willing to pass on the same benefit to the generation below you. Would you be where you are today without it? Do you think your employees are happy at a workplace that doesn't value them enough to invest in a bit of training?

I do agree that some CVs are absolutely dreadful. I've also been involved in interview processes. One that particularly stands out is our previous requirement for a Network Engineer. The interviewees were asked to connect a computer to the network, map a drive and configure Active Directory &amp; Group Policy to deploy an MSI to their computer. About half of them had written about their experience with AD, most of them couldn't manage it. 

As I see it, there are two parts to this problem:

1- If you have experience with AD, it should be possible to do this in your sleep. 

2- It serves the employer right for putting out a bullshit job description. That isn't a Network Engineer job.",0,1378547439,null,0,1378547969,0,cc3hklx,t3_1lwhp5,t1_cc3hklx,t1_cc3h6pz,null,1429560402,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

With postgrad courses it's harder to give a definite answer because the fee structures aren't regulated, so each university is free to set its own policies.

Your best bet is to ask the international students admission officer at the institutions you're interested in studying at, to get a definitive answer.

Even if wages are too high, they can't be high for long, because workers will rationally accept lower wages. Therefore there cannot be a business cycle. 

This line of thinking also means that it makes sense for all of Europe and the US to deleverage at the same time and that a reduction in consumption is not damaging because businesses will invest if the government cuts its spending.

I agree...

Here is my rule of thumb when finding a car.

* Look something as young as possible within your budget, but that has just had it's 60,000 mile service.

The reason for this is any factory faults would likely have come up already at that stage, and the 60k service is the golden one where cam belts, water pumps and so on are changed. People though all tend to focus too much on finding something with as low a mileage as possible, so they pay over the odds for a false sense of quality. 

Doing this has meant paying 2k for a car, which I can get a good 200,000 miles or more out of, as a majority of cars can achieve 300-400k if you stick to regular oil changes and general maintenance. Modern cars also never rust (A few years ago, you would find anything under 8 years would have rotten seals that you finger would cave through).",0,1378554278,null,0,1378628487,0,cc3iaxx,t3_1lwn8k,t1_cc3iaxx,t1_cc3hqg3,null,1429560060,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
