&gt;While captured customers keep paying this ridiculous tax or being required to take jobs miles from home (which seems to correlate well with divorce) nothing will change. 

And how do you propose to change things?

&gt;No, it's objectively a decent thing and certain laws of physics says the car is failed paradigm. What's the ratio of payload to vessel—70kg and 1700kg? Who wants to eat their dinner, bring up children, live, walk, breathe, or almost anything next to a road way? Exactly, so it fails in terms of physics and humanity.

Fails in terms of physics? Are you serious? That's the most bat-shit crazy thing I've ever head a cyclist say.

And that image is also irrelevant. It assumes that people do not car share (I take another four people to work) and does not take speed into account.

&gt;This sums up the ridiculousness of your argument and the victim complex drivers have for themselves. In the last 24 hours two people cycling have died and one is in intensive care in completely distinct incidents on the same road in London. If that was a ""terror"" event London would be on lock down and mosques would be on fire, but because the threat was a motor vehicle hardly anyone bats an eye. You are not the persecuted class but sadomasochists.

Because cars are a necessary evil. They keep civilisation running. It's why every country in the world uses them

And sadomasochism? Fuck off, that doesn;t make the slightest bit of sense.

&gt;Evil is truly banal—you may not be trying but that seems to be the side effects. You contribute to war for oil supplies, 34b£ in NHS and welfare costs as a result of RTCs, possibly thousands of people die prematurely due to exhaust fumes, air pollution is alarmingly linked to low birthweight, and of course there is climate change.

And yet you still struggle to grasp the concept that the world runs on automobiles, and there is currently no viable alternative.

&gt;But it needs to be more expensive because it doesn't account for all its collateral damage.

What? Are you actually serious? You think that the cost of cars outweighs their benefits.

Mate, you should go tell all the governments of the world that they're doing civilisation wrong.

&gt;Cars need to be excluded from town centres, HGVs probably need banning altogether during social hours, 20 mph speed limits should be in place where there isn't segregation, drivers overtaking on a blind bend killing someone coming the other way shouldn't be walking free from courts, lanes of traffic need to be given to pedestrians and cycling, one way systems need to be brought in, and drivers should be de-prioritised.

Absolutely fine.

But don't fucking charge me more for my commute, for which I have no viable alternative.",0,1383773641,null,0,false,0,cd8c71i,t3_1q0ojd,t1_cd8c71i,t1_cd8brtt,null,1428764173,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Even though Cissokho was very bad against Arsenal (and he wasn't the only one) there are still a few reasons why he shouldn't be dropped for Agger. For starters he keeps the width out there, and it doesn't matter that he's one dimensional and not exactly Roberto Carlos going forward, he stretches the play for others. Secondly, and this is a big problem with the ""Agger should play in position X because he's Daniel Agger"" brigade, is that players in different positions have different fitness requirements. Agger couldn't cover the ground in the same way that Cissokho can, not to mention the key difference in the number of high intensity sprints that the two positions require (centre half being a position that requires very little high intensity movement). 

Remember when Rafa tried David Luiz in midfield last season and could only give him 45, then 60, then 70 every week for about a month? It's the same principal, if we want Daniel Agger to play left back properly (and I don't think we do) then he'll need time to adjust his regime and his game and so on. Otherwise he can't be mobile or ambitious enough going forwards (see Sakho/Toure at full back vs. Southampton).

- Cech was as solid as ever.

- Cahill/Terry looked to have a great understanding together today

- Ivanovic did well defensively, I still struggle to see him filling that attacking right back role though. It was almost like we played 3 at the back today and then with 3 defensive mids, Ivan being one of them.

- Rami/Mikel looked fantastic after the first 10 minutes. Shaky start though.

- Oscar has quickly grown on me. Man the kid is a work horse and he has so much skill on top of that. That is what Mou wants from Hazard and Mata.

- Willian and Schurrle easily made a case for both of their spots. I think Willian played a little better than Schurrle but they both did really well.

but with an exponentially increasing global population coupled with finite resources this cannot continue indefinitely.

Increased population has inflated demand for housing, to the point that it outstrips supply and house builders are reluctant to build more, as it will deflate the value of their finished product.

And the Occupy Movement started in the United States out of the very stark reality of wealth inequality.

So what do you expect us to do?

Protest? All it takes is one person, whether by his own free will or hired by the authorities to get violent and that gives the police enough legitimacy to crush it with force or the media enough legitimacy to condemn those who took part or both. All three protest movements above reinforce this statement.

Vote? It takes millions of votes to make a tangible political change and all the parties are just as bad as each other. Britain also votes on class lines with many poor people voting Labour, many rich people voting Conservative and neither of them voting for another candidate out of fear that the other major party wins. Besides, the Liberal Democrats have kinda shown that politicians will go completely against their electoral pledge and backstab their voters for a smidge of power, no matter how insignificant.

The conservative party only look after upper class privileges, no matter how much they try to persuade us that they're trying to the best for everyone. Look at the job center, the rise in tuition fees etc. They've made the Liberal Democrats the scapegoat- people say that they should have stopped the conservatives from raising tuition but how? They gave in with promises of other things they wanted.


And Labour? They're manifesto states ""pro-business"" and ""pro-reform"" but how enforceable is this? They say To the young unemployed we will say that after 6 months you will get an offer of a job, but that if you don’t take it you will lose your benefits. And for the long term unemployed after 2 years."" But HOW? How can they promise that?


The Liberal Democrats need to come through. They need a strong leader. Their manifesto promises fair education and this, I believe, is the key. Lower classes need to know what is obtainable. I come from a terribly poor area and am the first person from my school to go to university. Why? Because my family encouraged my education, read me books, made me do my homework and the teachers told me I could do great things. But I was a rarity. Others didn't have this encouragement. And I don't mean tell them a degree is right, just tell them that working and achieving is better than not working.

Only a small fraction of the public will vote in any given referendum. The people in that small fraction tend to be the ones who have the most extreme views on the issue - because they're the only ones that care enough to vote. 

The net result is that the result of a referendum does not at all represent the views of the majority. It reflects the views of an extreme minority. 

If we had a similar system to Switzerland, I wouldn't put it past our tabloids being able to whip up enough frenzy to execute whichever paedophile is newsworthy that week by referendum. It's not much more far-fetched than banning minarets.

true,grollcool,null,null,"&gt; Common misconception is that these goals off defensive mistakes and keeper mistakes are purely luck. Mou has oriented an extreme HIGH pressure system which has absolutely contributed to the mistakes of keepers and defenders alike.

We dont have an extreme high pressure system.... if you noticed when the other team has the ball in their half we dont immediately push our team forward. ( We actually get into a compact unit and try and contain them and then spring into action as soon as we get the ball) Watch Ajax, Bayern, Barcelona. These teams all play high pressure systems where the ENTIRE team pushes up the field, in some cases to the half line mark making the other teams half crowded and the other team more likely to losing the ball. This is a somewhat risky approach but can pay off very well when executed properly. The only weakness is that if that the other team can quickly counter attack you due to your high line which is why Jose doesn't play the system. he prefers a much more safer approach. The reason that we have scored on these defensive mistakes is because we chase down long balls, that has nothing to do with team pressure. Both of our goals from goalkeeper + defender mixup was originally kicked by one of our players, then both Azpi and Torres just followed the ball. BECAUSE they followed the ball they pressured the defenders into making mistakes but that is an individual play, not a team play. Both Torres and Azpi were alone chasing their respectful passes. The other 2 goals were purely individual and partly quick thinking from Eto'o. Neither of which has anything to do with any team system. 

So to quickly sum it up, the perseverance of our forwards for not giving up on lost causes and to have some quick thinking is what got us the goals so far. Not any particular tactical system. The best quote for this is from Azpi's interview after the match when asked to describe the goal, he said 'I dont know what happened. I just kept on running..'.

true,ZoFreX,eng-GreaterLondon,Wimbledon,"Given the facts available it seems highly likely that at least some people did repeat the story knowing that it was false. Here's Private Eye's take on events:

&gt; BAA HUMBUG

&gt; Halley's comet, Peter Mandelson resigning, Ulrika being dumped and Tim Henman getting knocked out of Wimbledon: some stories can be relied on to turn up regularly in the papers with only the tiniest alterations required to bring them up to date.

&gt; One such is that which reappeared in the Sun, Mail, Times and Mirror, and most spectacularly emblazoned across the front fo the Daily Express last week: ""Political Correctness goes mad at the nursery: NOW IT'S BAA BAA RAINBOW SHEEP.""

&gt; According to the Express: ""Teachers at a government-backed school were ordered to change the lyrics of the classic Baa Baa Black Sheep... The idea was to 'avoid offending children' and keep in line with 'equal opportunities'.""

&gt; This tale - wherein a politically correct administrator insists that children remove all references that could be racist from Baa Baa Black Sheep - first surfaced in February 1986, when the Daily Star and Sun declared that ""looney left-wing councillors"" had banned children at Hackney play groups from singing the rhyme. It was not true then either.

&gt; Neither was it true in October that year, when the Daily Mail claimed play leaders on a Haringey council racism awareness course had been told to stamp out the song; nor in 1987, when Islington Council went to court to stop an SDP party political broadcast which falsely claimed they had imposed a ban; nor in 2000 when various papers relocated it to Birmingham; and nor in 2005 when the Mail on Sunday moved it all the way up to Aberdeen.

&gt; For the record, the charity Parents and Children Together, which runs the two play groups at the centr of last week's outbreak, told the Press Association that ""children at the two family centres sing a variety of descriptive words in the nursery rhyme to turn the song into an action rhyme. They sing happy, sad, bouncing, hopping, pink, blue, black and white sheep etc. This encourages the children to extend their vocabulary."" Curiously, this explanation went unreported by any of the national papers.

Any decent statistician will tell you that if you win a referendum by getting, say, 60% of a 10% turnout, then you have **not** shown that a majority of people support you. Your 10% turnout will certainly be an extremely biased sample of the population. 

It is reasonable to assume that the default position of most of the apathetic 90% is *against* changing the status quo. They didn't care enough about most fringe issues to vote, but they don't *support* them or are neutral. (Anyone who strongly supports or rejects the referendum is in the 10%). 

This is an accurate model of student politics, where around 5-10% (the highly keen/nuts) vote. The representatives, elected by maybe 4% of the student body, then enact their slightly mad policies, like banning a song they don't like or stopping people from wearing sombreros. Most people still don't care enough to vote, but they will agree that the policy was stupid. 

The little things add up. 

Thus a referendum - at least in its current form - is very unlikely to actually truly represent the wishes of the public. Referenda give false results. 

***

Concerning other elections, I think we have a definite problem. It's inconvenient to vote (you have to go somewhere and maybe wait), and most people feel like their vote is worthless. 

The small turnouts cause tangible issues - we end up with unrepresentative crazies in the EU Parliament and councillors who think that disabled children should be 'put down'. These people do not proportionally represent the views of the public.

Options on the table to try to improve the situation include:

* Some form of PR 
* Mandatory voting 
* Reduced number of elections 
* Make voting easy - online/mobile 

However, nobody seems to be seriously considering these, or coming up with more ideas. 

Ironically, the last referendum on a form or PR (AV) was rejected because the incumbent parties made a huge effort to whip up just enough of the population into hysteria about how AV would destroy British democracy forever. Most of the public didn't care much - even though AV was likely very much in their interest if they wanted their views represented in parliament. As a result, they didn't vote. The people who did vote were the ones with extreme views - extremely strong views against AV due to the self-interest of incumbents. 

All of our systems of voting are a self-perpetuating mess, and the only way to change them is through.. voting. It's a nightmare. ",0,1383781859,null,0,false,0,cd8fqyz,t3_1q0pei,t1_cd8fqyz,t1_cd8ej4a,null,1428762444,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"That simply makes it more of a responsibility for us to do something about it. Even Obama, the authoritarian, drone striking anti-whisteblower bastard that he is, has said their surveillance may need more oversight but I have heard no such thing from the UK government. There is at least some engagement in the US and some possibility of getting something done. Here in the UK there has been no indication that anything will be done and active negotiations to prevent the EU from doing anything. Cameron has barely even acknowledged that GCHQ is spying on people; he's only criticised people who are revealing the information not acknowledged it's truth. They seem perfectly happy to have the current system continue and their brazen attitude to to all is stunning. 

The fact that they haven't sat back and admitted being beaten but instead arrested David Miranda and tried to suppress the reports indicates there is a lot more stuff to come out, specifically GCHQ stuff that will prove GCHQ is doing stuff worse than anything the NSA has been doing and they are so desperate to suppress it they are willing to ruin their image by arresting a journalist's partner and intimidate a newspaper presumably because what will come out will be much worse. Fuckers need to be shut down now. As Greenwald said 'I have many more documents to report on, including ones about the UK, where I'll now focus more.'

I don't care if it makes it easier for terrorists to kill me. The only reason I would be upset about threats to my country is if my country was worth defending. If I'm not allowed to be left alone or go about my daily life without GCHQ checking up on me why the fuck do I care if the idyllic peace is shattered - it wasn't peace, it was just a simulated fiction in which we we're only allowed to participate as long as we check in everyday with GCHQ, give them our emails, texts, phone calls, search history, credit and purchase history, and any other piece of information that might be useful in prosecuting us now or in the future. I don't want to be melodramatic but does anybody consider China to be somewhere worth fighting for or a place worth defending from terrorists? You can't live their happily because if you are anything other than docile they do what they did to Ei Weiwei and put you under surveillance, arrest you and beat you up. Who gives a shit if terrorists want to kill members of the Chinese government; it's not like the government has created a space for people to live happily (and often distributed violence and intimidation more than it's enemies) so why would those people care about it's defence. That's not where we are now but the attitude of our politicians and our security services will lead us down that road. It's such a strange form of cognitive dissonance to violate the rights of your citizens in order to protect your citizens - how you get there mentally I don't know but China has been there a while and we're slowly heading there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I just think it would be nice to have a defensive midfielder who can break things up defensively

Posted this in the match thread: Mikel 100% on tackles, take-ons, clearances, aerial duels, 5 ball recoveries and 39/44 on passes. All from the first half.

We don't need to replace Mikel. We need to replace an aging Lampard. We need a midfield maestro. In the thread I created a couple of days ago, Gundogan was the player who got the most response. Gundogan doesn't contribute so much defensively, except for tracking back, which is the ethos of Klopp's Dortmund...  

Mikel is the most underrated player of this sub, because no-one in here actually understands his role. His job is to break down attacks and cover space that the opponent can utilize. Not a fancy job is it? But I'll tell you what, without Mikel today, we would've lost. Mikel gives Ramires the freedom to burst forward like he can, and when AVB/Benitez thought that Ramires could do that without Mikel and put on Lampard instead, they lost a lot of points. 

One example is the FA Cup match against Manchester United last spring. We were down 2-0, after a Chicharito header from Carrick (Who Mata didn't bother tracking back against) and another goal. Benitez immediately puts Mikel on after the break and we dominate United in their stadium and fight back a 2-2. Mikel destroyed every Manchester United attack and silenced Carrick, all by himself, and thus allowed Ramires to help on the counter's which were all vital to our comeback.

All in all, Mikel and Ramires is the best CM pairing in the club at this moment, but we need a maestro to help breaking down teams when we are in possession. And no, stop thinking of Pirlo, anyone who actually knows a bit about him knows that he has been shit all season and is nowhere near the standard he was in when he first arrived to Juventus.

Exactly. It's in their taxes too, because when you don't give people preventative healthcare they just don't go to the doctor for small things, and it's a lot cheaper to treat a cough before it develops into pneumonia, or remove a mole before it turns into later-stage skin cancer. When people can't afford early intervention they end up in the ER in a terrible state, and the government pays far more for the care that is now immediately necessary, and they almost certainly have far worse outcomes to boot.

That's the frustrating thing about it--EVERYONE loses in this system. The people paying more in taxes for healthcare than anyone else in the world, and having to pay for insurance on top of that, AND often a percentage of medical bills even after insurance covers their part, and the people who have no coverage and suffer for lack of healthcare.

And yet no matter how many times I've broken out that statistic in response to people saying they don't want universal healthcare in the US because they don't want their taxes to ""carry"" people *who are already being ""carried"" more expensively*, not one person has even bothered to acknowledge it, let alone come back with any kind of argument.",0,1383788245,null,0,false,0,cd8icfl,t3_1q0jts,t1_cd8icfl,t1_cd80gob,null,1428761232,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,The_Bravinator,lancashire,Lancashire,"The other side of it, though, is that private healthcare in the UK is competing against the NHS--they have to offer something extra in order to get people to buy in. My mum works in a private hospital in the UK and it's like a hotel. Gorgeous, great food, fantastic staff-patient ratio etc.

Private healthcare here in the US is the only option you get (other than NO healthcare) so it's not dressed up so nicely. 

In my experience as someone who moved from the UK to the US (which, obviously, is entirely anecdotal and won't hold true for everyone):

--testing and intervention is done more quickly and eagerly in the US than on the NHS. On the one hand that probably saves lives--my grandad died from a spinal tumor that had been giving him symptoms for *years* for lack of a simple scan. On the other hand it can really drive up the cost. I went to the ER because I had mono/glandular fever and my vomit had blood in it. It was the middle of the night and I just wanted someone to take a look at me and make sure I was okay. Instead they decided I looked a little dehydrated and, instead of handing me a glass of water, stuck a saline drip in my arm. I didn't know enough to protest--until I got the bill. Holy shit.

--surroundings are no better than NHS hospitals. Still kind of drab and dreary, food seems shitty. My husband cut off the end of his finger a few years ago and they just stuck him in a hallway on a stretcher for a few hours. I mean, he just had a bleeding finger and wasn't in any danger, but with the amount we PAY for medical care here I sort of expected better. They could at least have given him a painkiller.

--ER/A&amp;E wait times don't seem any better. As well as the above example of my husband being stuck in a hallway for a few hours, the time I went for the blood-vomit thing I was waiting for *twelve hours* before being seen. Again, with the sheer amount of money we spend on healthcare I thought I'd see something much better than the budget-pressed NHS. 

All in all, I'd be happier to have NHS service and costs than something that is only better in a few areas and costs the freaking earth.

The 'Activity log' isn't, the site demonstrates it can fill this in for you but doesn't actually log any of your activity by itself.  If you apply for a job that leads to a 3rd party site (and the vast majority do) this isn't actually logged by the site as an application being made. 

On the security front nobody developing it seemed to be aware of tabbed browsers.  It recognises you've closed the browser window but not a single tab the site may be in.  So, as happened on the DWP advisors machine, she ended up surfing around the site (demoing it to me) whilst logged in as someone else.

And as I said elsewhere most of the jobs seem to be going to 3rd party sites, many of which seem to be stuffing their DB with a scrape of agencies own sites and the usual big ones; so you'll get the exact same job appearing 4 or 5 times.

Absolute bag of nails and shows no real sign of improving.   The worst of it is that the UJM database is now trying to supply the job points as well, but the two are quite compatible so now all job points show ""NMW &lt;value&gt; &lt;random figure&gt;"" instead of the wage the position pays.

true,The_Bravinator,lancashire,Lancashire,"I have to wonder if the age where you start learning is more important than we tend to think--not because you have more years to learn, but because of the critical period for learning language.

Kids who grow up with two languages absorb both as easily as they would one. Feral children who grow up WITHOUT language until they reach a certain age (I think it's around 11?) are never able to speak any language fluently. Something in the brain changes or closes off around that age and seems to stop us from naturally picking up the rules and grammar of languages the way we do as young children. Children who grew up feral seem to speak even their primary language as I, a non-native speaker, might speak halting and inaccurate French.

Obviously it's possible for adults to become fluent in other languages if they surround themselves with other speakers and practice constantly that way, but it seems to take on a *much* higher level of difficulty and a much lower level of success when one does not begin learning as a young child.

I can't help but wonder if it's a big mistake that we often only begin teaching a second language at the end of that critical period--age 11.

It is possible that you've been brought in at an unfortunately busy time (my area at the moment is insanely busy on food) I've been guilty myself of using a new starter as emergency washers or floor runners, because you need your strongest people doing the hardest work, and trust me if it's that busy then adding the three minutes on to each ticket it would take to teach you how to do it properly would result in a lot of unhappy customers as the tickets pile up and they're waiting twenty five minutes for food they expect to be out in ten. The proper cooking training takes time, and you'd prefer to learn when it's appropriately quiet and you can take your time and not be rushed.

However, the food on the floor business is utterly disgusting and should be stamped out immediately.

If the bedrooms are a bit small or lacking closet space, then we find a way to make do.

Having too few bedrooms, so that we share with our kids, is basically unthinkable.

I think there maybe economies of scale elements to this, in that it makes basically no difference to the home buyer if a bedroom is a foot shorter or closet is a couple of square feet smaller, but to the home builder this may add up to one or two additional properties over the whole of the development.

Whilst you or I might be prepared, considering it dispassionately, to pay an extra couple of grand for extra closet space and power sockets, we probably won't be in the position in which we're choosing between two almost identical which only vary by this factor.

&gt;In my experience as someone who moved from the UK to the US (which, obviously, is entirely anecdotal and won't hold true for everyone):

&gt;--testing and intervention is done more quickly and eagerly in the US than on the NHS. On the one hand that probably saves lives--my grandad died from a spinal tumor that had been giving him symptoms for years for lack of a simple scan. On the other hand it can really drive up the cost. I went to the ER because I had mono/glandular fever and my vomit had blood in it. It was the middle of the night and I just wanted someone to take a look at me and make sure I was okay. Instead they decided I looked a little dehydrated and, instead of handing me a glass of water, stuck a saline drip in my arm. I didn't know enough to protest--until I got the bill. Holy shit.

&gt;--surroundings are no better than NHS hospitals. Still kind of drab and dreary, food seems shitty. My husband cut off the end of his finger a few years ago and they just stuck him in a hallway on a stretcher for a few hours. I mean, he just had a bleeding finger and wasn't in any danger, but with the amount we PAY for medical care here I sort of expected better. They could at least have given him a painkiller.

&gt;--ER/A&amp;E wait times don't seem any better. As well as the above example of my husband being stuck in a hallway for a few hours, the time I went for the blood-vomit thing I was waiting for twelve hours before being seen. Again, with the sheer amount of money we spend on healthcare I thought I'd see something much better than the budget-pressed NHS.

&gt;All in all, I'd be happier to have NHS service and costs than something that is only better in a few areas and costs the freaking earth.",0,1383793291,null,0,false,0,cd8kfnp,t3_1q0jts,t1_cd8kfnp,t1_cd81oaw,null,1428760257,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mulian,null,null,"I wanted to trust the Liberal Democrats at the last election. I more or less agree that they are being scapegoated. They have won a fair amount of concessions and moderated the tories, even contradicted them at times, but they failed on other key issues. Tripling tuition fees was a massive betrayal for young people who helped to get them to power. They have failed to champion the young and poor, and instead collude in kicking them while they're down. They could have walked away. But instead, they stuck their nose in the trough. The prospect of power after over half a century out of government was just too tempting to refuse. I still harbour that resentment, but who knows, a change in leadership might help. In a way, it's tragic. There are good intentions at the core of the Lib Dems, but now they are actively participating in the persecution of those Nick Clegg promised to help. The best thing they can do now to rebuild voters' trust is to leave the coalition early. The coalition agreement probably has a clause against that, but it is probably better than the alternative.

Also, I don't really agree that simply telling people that working and achieving is going to make a difference. People need to know what they're working for, and they need a genuine choice. The government is actively stripping people of opportunities, and *punishing* them for thinking outside the box. We need to flush this toxic mentality out of parliament.

I think Hazard and Mata can make all the plays you'll need.

Luiz passing is just too good

Lukaku has that ability to push players around that is sooo handy for smaller teams.

Mata to stay behind Hazard in general on a 'triangle based' defence, as Mata isn't as good as Hazard at sprinting back to pressure the man on the ball, meaning if he stayed forward I think the other team would '3on2' counter attack too often.

Courtois over Cech as I feel that reactions and flexibility are some of the key strengths of a Futsal keeper. Courtois has the advantage there I feel.

true,nocaph,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"I'm in agreement with everyone here who is saying report it.  It is a serious public health matter, meat being dropped on the floor and then served to customers is just asking for someone to get food poisoning, and some people can't handle it as well as others.  

The colour boards / knifes are obviously meant to be some sort of system - that you seem to be convinced isn't being used.  And there's that significant danger of allergies - if someone goes into anaphalactic shock after eating a food, but it's not on their known allergy list (because it's not that food), then it gets added to the list - messing with their health records.  

&gt; ""Should I just put another one on?"" and she picked it up and said ""You didn't see anything!"" and out the food went.

This suggests wilful ignorance of the regulations.  They know what they are but they're ignoring them.  

**I would like to ask - they should have a food safety hygiene rating displayed to customers (1-5) what does theirs say?** 

I was in a Wetherspoons the other day and it was a 5.  If they're showing a 5 and you can provide evidence to the contrary then it could be argued quite easily this is a deliberate cover-up.

Like others have said, there are anonymous ways of reporting this, and I'm not sure about the law in this area (I read recording audio of someone is legal but can only be used in court with that person's permission... I'm not sure, check me on that) - but there must be a way of doing it carefully and anonymously that other people can/have suggested.

In addition, I'd like to point out that most of your episodes are on the more serious side of things (a bunch being season finales, so its to be expected), so maybe try to lighten it up a little with some fun episodes. 

I noticed you have no episodes of Ten actually travelling with Rose (which he will be in TDotD), so personally I'd add something from series 2. I suggest *School Reunion* which works to tie in a bit of the Classsic series, as well as give a bit of insight into Sarah Jane / Rose for *Journey's End*, which is on your list, and remedies both of my issues.

Another thing worth adding would be *The Snowmen* as that is where ""The Impossible Girl"" stuff really begins, as well as the Paternoster Gang, which are vital details to *The Name of the Doctor*, which is of course on your list, and I assume will be somewhat important to TDotD.

Other than that, it wouldn't hurt to show them *Time Crash* to get a sense of the multi-Doctor story, or any of the classic multi-Doctor stuff if you have time for it.

**TL;DR:** Ditch *Daleks in Manhattan* 2-parter, replace it with *School Reunion* and *The Snowmen*, and throw *Time Crash* in as well.

There are still buildings that haven't been repaired since the war, and not because of historical significance, not to mention empty warehouses and disused factories, collieries, mills and the like. As for crumbling roads, there are plenty of potholes and tarmac with large cracks in, especially on country roads. The ones that are in decent shape are generally like that because they get dug up every three months to lay cables/pipes and none of the companies co-ordinate with other.

* No basements - well I know of at least a few houses with them though they're usually called cellars. One of them has a pool table in, but it's a bit cramped.

* The washer/dryer thing - I must be imagining those settings on my machine then. Granted, it doesn't actually get anything dry, but that's because it's been broken for months and I can't afford to get it fixed or replaced.

* ""All Brits iron, or hire someone to do it"" - Ahahahaha, no. Ok, weddings and funerals, out of respect for other (important, to me) people. Generally though I won't touch an iron.

I'm assuming your not resident in the EU at the moment and will be a visitor so if you go through the questions the answer it gives is 

""If you’ve got a full and valid licence you can drive any small vehicle (eg car or motorcycle) listed on your licence for 12 months from when you last entered Great Britain (GB).""

So the question then is whether a restricted Japanese 400cc licence is classed as a full licence or not. 

I'm not sure who could answer that, you could try calling or emailing the DVLA but I'm not sure they'd be any help.

I speak as someone who is literate in two languages, and conversant in three (four if you count Cantonese, which is technically a dialect and not a language). I also happen to have a law degree from an excellent Russell Group University, and a postgraduate degree. Further, I happen to be based in Singapore and am therefore in a prime position to observe the gradual tightening of immigration policies here, and across Asia in general. 

Up till fairly recently (think: 2011) it was easy enough for any foreign person to come here to work - even if they did not have a degree (such economic immigrants typically went into the blue-collar jobs). Degree holders were, for obvious reasons, welcomed with open arms (and dropped pants). 

Fast forward 2 years - at the last General Election here, there was a massive backlash against the incumbent Government for allowing ""too many foreigners"" into the country. The arguments and howls of the incensed local population here are eerily similar to some of the worst that the UKIP has to offer - immigration hurts jobs, immigrants don't localise well, the foreigners don't speak English/ can't speak it well enough, they're taking our jobs and our women...they commit crimes...

Frankly, if I blindfolded myself and filterd out the obvious local accent in some of the tripe I hear on the Tube and buses here I would fully believe myself to be in the heart of some of the most anti-immigration areas in the UK.

Edit: In answer to your ""EU Member State"" point, I would highlight that while EU law does facilitate the cross-border employability of any EU Citizen, the availability of jobs is still very much subject to the whole supply and demand thing. Given the current parlous state of many of the 'classic' EU states whose languages UK citizens are generally schooled in (and competent in, if at all) - I'm not so sure that I would immediately say that the EU is an immediately accessible *and* sustainable 'escape route'. Also, if you've followed the news recently, there seems to be an increasing level of resentment against immigrants (of colour at present, but the overtones will eventually, in my opinion, extend).

sorry to break it to you but it's not 6 weeks, it's 2 years. the probation period, for someone who doesn't negotiate their contract, is basically an internal policy with no legal status.

however, the one reason they can't fire you (without a lawsuit) is whistleblowing, which is bringing to a manager's attention a breach of health and safety laws (which you would be). 

i specialise in tribunal claims and would take your case for nothing as a fellow-redditor. however ...

there are still court fees to be paid (two chunks, up to £250 to start the claim and up to £950 at the end, depending on ability to pay). if you won you would be compensated for your loss of earnings only (and any court fees would be returned). therefore even if you won you would not be any better off than if you simply sought another job now.

you'd be better-compensated if you were treated badly (eg if your manager was rude to you) instead of being fired.

at least, that is the strictly legal position. the pr dept might well have something to say about the size of the cheque if you brought a whistle-blowing claim.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;You've just not thought about it enough. People use the word ""efficient"" and ""convenient"" to call the motor a winner but it is objectively inefficient by simple inspection in terms of energy and time. Physics should be self evident, haulage firms would collapse if they had a 1700kg vessel transporting 70kg payloads in the common case. In terms of units per a given area (capacity) driving fails because of size. Having the working population be their own unpaid chauffeur for 1-2 hours a day is an insane productivity loss. Economically, physically, and socially the motor is a failed mass transport paradigm.

No, you've not thought about it at all. This is possibly the most bullshit thing I've ever seen anyone on reddit. If cars were so horrifically poor at carrying out their job, then why are they so massively widespread?

When talking about 'efficiency' you're not taking speed into account. You fail to understand that increasing the speed at which something can be done increases productivity.

High energy expenditure is a product of speed. Your little bicycle is extremely efficient in terms of energy, but it is massively slower than a car in most situations. What happens when you need to travel motorway distances?

Why do you struggle to understand that cars are faster than bikes in so many situations that they are absolutely essential, and are absolutely not a 'failed paradigm'.

As for your bizarre haulage firm analogy - do you not realise that Royal Mail uses cars to deliver a massive portion of their letters, and that these cars weigh vastly more than the cargo they are carrying?

&gt;Arguing by anecdote is poor form. If I were to do the same I would include reference to my commute across half of Manchester which door-to-door is faster than the car and the train at any time.

I wasn't arguing exclusively by anecdote though was I?

It's an undeniable fact that not every car carries just a single person.

And you never answered the speed issue.

&gt;Of course it does. Cars kill people, traffic conditions induce road rage, air pollution kills people, angry streets lead to antisocial spaces—that's the sadism. And the masochism is that the working population puts themselves through that experience everyday.

Fuck off mate. None of us receive sexual gratification from the knowledge that we are polluting the air or causing road rage. You've just thrown that word in there without even thinking.

&gt;The same arguments literally were made for slavery. Evils are evil, there is no necessary about it. Like I said, the car looks necessary because it's seen 100 years of shitty optimisations that still makes for a horrid experience in the common case and a failed mass transit paradigm.

Jesus Christ mate, it's not failed at all. If cycling and public transport were so much better, then that's what we'd use. But they aren't.

&gt;You yourself describe a hateful experience but woe betide anyone that challenges it.

What? I love driving.

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"As a former Line Chef this makes my blood run cold, this is without a doubt a list of massive breeches of various Food Hygiene regulations.

Lets go down the list

&gt;I dropped a burger pattie and I said to my manager ""Should I just put another one on?"" and she picked it up and said ""You didn't see anything!"" and out the food went.

This should have been thrown out and and marked on the wastage sheet, as a new starter you would get some leeway in this but experienced cooks would not be expected to be dropping food on the floor, the contamination you could be passing to the customer alone does not bear thinking of..

&gt;Freezer items from the tall fridge are thrown onto the griddle to ""save time"" (it's about 2 metres away) and if they roll off and do several laps around the kitchen, they get picked up and put back on. They would rather do that than have wastage. Chicken always rolls off.

Frozen items should be defrosted correctly before being cooked, I used to pull trays of frozen chicken and then they were left 24/48 hours in chiller to defrost and used with 24 hours. Again dropping food on the floor from the Griddle should be disposed of and looking at why it is falling from the griddle

&gt;No one respects vegetarian food. If the veggie fryers are being used for chips and onion rings, the veggie sausages get put in the meat fryer. Today, to save space, I had to put a veggie burger pattie in the same fry basket as scampi.

I used toahve 6 fryers, only ever ran 4 of them, one was always dedicated to Frys and Veg products, Vegetarians are trusting us to supply them with meat free products, cooking them in fat that has had meat products in them is a massive No No

&gt;cross contamination happens all the time. No one has explained to me the different coloured knives, tongs or chopping boards because everyone uses them for anything. Spoons to scoop out coleslaw are used to scoop out guacamole. If you're allergic to one of them, then tough shit.

Cross contamination is a killer in the kitchen, the colours on the knives and boards is to highlight if it should be used for meat, Fish, Diary or Vegetables, you can see the issue right away, doing Fish on a meat board means you could unwittingly trigger a seafood allergy in someone who is eating meat to avoid this.

Male circumcision is often done as a baby, so thankfully the boy will not remember it being done, however FGM takes place when the girl is around 8-11 years old with no medicine or medical aftercare.
Did you know that if type 3 is performed then it is the job of the husband to rip open the flesh upon consummation of the marriage so he can penetrate his wife.

In-fact they have made a job out of successfully gaming the system. They go to Job seekers and complete the required tasks with minimum effort and get the rest of the time off. 

The second is the system itself, jaded by aforementioned people, is not properly designed to help people. Any one of us, no matter what our status, career or earnings, could lose our position and suffer misfortune and it could be us going to Job Seekers. The truth is, when I am out of a job, I just look for another one and don't sign on. Not everyone can afford to do that.

My bf and I moved the UK about a month and a half ago from the US to go to Uni. I'm going after a PhD and he's after his BSc. Since we were accepted into our respective programs this meant that our visas were sponsored by the universities. In my case, I also receive a salary from the University as part of my agreement to come here. You would think given all of this it would be easy to get a visa - but it was just the start of troubles. 

For myself, I had a hell of a time just getting all the paperwork in order. The university was doing what they could to provide their paperwork, but the specific visa paperwork is left up to the applicant. This means you get to spend fun amounts of time at a local Homeland Security office where the you-can-tell-their-attitudes-are-based-on-focus-groups-and-lawsuits-because-no-one-is-that-cheery workers will take your biometrics and send you on your way. That is, if you can get an appointment within the next month. I had lived in Phoenix, they allowed 6 visa appointments a day only. You also must pay the visa fees which are just below $500 per application. If your visa is denied, you do not get this back. From that inconvenience I had to prove that not only was my salary going to suffice, but that I also had an extra absurd amount of money for a graduate student to have in the bank (greater than $10k). This was meant to prove that I won't be a burden on the UK government. From there you send everything off and hope it gets approved. They're pretty good about emailing you on the status - but if you have questions you better be prepared to call a 900 number at some obscene rate that won't actually answer your questions. I know this from experience. 

For my bf, it got trickier. His uni wasn't providing his visa paperwork because they're douchebags (wankers for the UK friends) and thought that they didn't need to work with any expediency. So the only thing we could do was something I'd never recommend - we applied for him to come over as a partner to me. This meant again, proving all of our finances, going through every record proving we'd been a couple for 3 years, paying the $500 fee, and then going through the bio appointments. We sent everything off - and it was denied. Our status as a couple was questioned because the bank statements, insurance letters, beneficiary information, and whatever other legal document we could find wasn't enough to prove we were a couple. On top of that, they actually said they didn't think it'd be much of a life to live off of my salary and even though we stated he intended to work - the response was basically a polite way of saying ""Yea, we don't believe you - fuck off."" The letter we received was insulting, degrading, and wholly demoralizing. And yes - my visa allowed for a partner.  We ended up having to move our plane tickets costing another $600 in fees.

After calling my bf's uni nearly everyday at every hour to get the proper documentation we finally received it and started the whole process over again - complete with a new application fee (keeping track, now it's $1,500 in visa fees, and $600 in airline fees). Again, pulled all the financials together, pulled all the remaining documents together, and more homeland appointments, we applied. This time we got it - but 1 day before our plane was to leave - the second time. 

So the short story of it doesn't sound bad - but when you live it you get grey hairs, suffer horrible anxiety, and become completely disenchanted with the opportunity in front of you. 

But that's not even half of your problems emigrating into the UK. You then need a bank account (which most banks won't give you - Lloyd's will though...but only because we were students but we couldn't get student accounts being foreign), then a place to live (you'll need guarantors that own their own place to vouche for you - and vouching in this manner means their entire financial history for 7 years or something ridiculous like that gets examined for the ability to cover your rent if you don't), mobile services (again, nearly no one will give you a contract,eventually Tesco gave us one and thankfully they seem really good so we're keeping them), then internet services (this could be another argument...it was for us. BT sucks. Do not do BT. They're assholes and cheats - and that smart-talk app they boast about doesn't fucking work [its why we wanted to go with them] Plus its an 18 month contract.). It goes without saying that American currency has no place here - and that it's worth far less than the pound. However, things that don't cost much in regards to being in the UK are suddenly really expensive for the first few months. And good luck getting your credit cards or debit cards to work here. The ATMs will take them - but a lot of places have no idea what it means to swipe a card. They stare at you like you tried to eat their hair. Yes - that weirdly. 

Anyway - the point being - use your UK connections to secure EU/UK citizenship and then the above all disappears. If not - you have to seriously think long and hard about this move. It's tough and wears you down. I hope this helps at all to illuminate what you're probably in for. Feel free to PM if you want/need to.

Again, look who is talking. You are the one unable to comprehend the reasons I hold my views and misattributing my motives.

There is nothing American about the simple concept of hard work and sacrifice being rewarded. It's the fundamental principle of rewarding those who deserve it.

&gt; ...all these poor people need to do is live a bit more frugally (not sure how you can get more frugal than porridge with water, as many of them are reduced to)

If people want to spend their time in education rather than working then it is up to *them* to decide if it is worthwhile, not you and not me.

Personally, I don't think this is a big deal (in the uk). And before you go off on me about how I don't think FGM is bad, I do think it is. But according to your petition 66,000 girls have undergone FGM in the UK, ever. That's 66,000 out of a population of 32,000,000 There's slightly more women then men, but for simplicity sake i'm just saying half the population. That's not even 1% of the population suffering from FGM. 

And so I can understand why Theresa May couldn't be bothered to reply, it simply isn't a pressing issue. There's far more things happening to Women as a group in first world countries than the incredibly low rates of FGM.

The Western world as a whole made its stand on FGM a long time ago, there's not much more that can be done to stop it. It's not a matter of educating people, as practically every person knows its bad. The only people who practice it do it for religious reasons and all the education in the world is not going to stop that.

Without stepping into peoples lives and watching them every minute of the day, there's not much you can do to stop something that effects less than 1% of the population.

Not to say that FGM isn't a problem in less developed parts of the world, because it's a huge problem there. There just isn't much that can be done about it in the UK.

&gt;Look who's talking! Aside from having a far more detailed knowledge of poverty than most people in the UK, I've also seen real poverty in other countries.

Knowing poor people is not experiencing poverty. Saying that is a bit like the whole ""I'm not racist, my best friend is black"" trope &amp; shows just how unqualified you are to pontificate about it. If you have not experienced the poverty, who you know is irrelevant.

&gt;There is nothing American about the simple concept of hard work and sacrifice being rewarded. It's the fundamental principle of rewarding those who deserve it.

No there isn't, but the level of blind ignorance and lack of empathy you are displaying is particularly American.

&gt;If people want to spend their time in education rather than working then it is up to them to decide if it is worthwhile, not you and not me. 

Constantly framing it as though it's just those pesky poor people making the wrong life choices, instead of taking on the question of how those people are supposed to get out of that poverty trap. Those stupid poor people, why are they wasting time getting an education?! They should be working out dead end jobs their whole lives to pay bills - what use is an education, other than probably helping them to permanently rise out of that dead end job and make a better life for their families. Useless!

Fuck them, it's clearly their attitude and nothing to do with external conditions at all - despite your own admission that for some people it's impossible to do both, it's somehow still their own stupid fault for being so poor they can't afford it.

That is your attitude, a pathetic abandonment of the poorest in society, wrapped up in pseudo intellectual rubbish and faux offence-taking.

If you think extrapolation to ridicule your logically inconsistent nonsense is ad hominem then prove me wrong and explain your attitude to the people, who you admitted above are forced to choose between the two, because as far as I can see, my mocking of you is pretty accurate - and if it isn't, it is purely the fault of the projection of yourself **you** have created.",0,1383824116,null,0,false,0,cd8rn00,t3_1q0rkn,t1_cd8rn00,t1_cd8r56e,null,1428756825,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For all you know when you run windows it's snapping your web camera and uploading your pictures to a random website. That's hyperbolic and almost 100 percent not true but without access to the source code how can you know 100 hundred percent conclusively know that your operating system is not doing something malicious.

There have been plenty of rumours because this is the same company that gave their [encryption keys for hotmail to the NSA](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data) and [Skype that covertly hands data to government agencies.](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/skype-ten-microsoft-nsa).

Just because there's no conclusive proof about Windows doesn't mean you aren't a fool for defaultly assuming there is one. 

&gt;What's to stop the big manufacturers including backdoors in their own ROMs? 

Exactly my point. People should be flashing open sourced roms whenever they buy a phone not relying a phone manufacturer that fills your phone with shit software and is a ROM you know nothing about.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Wanker and cunt are not slurs that directly target one group of people. They are all purpose insults. They are not used to denigrate someone's sexuality and are not thrown at people to bully them for their sexuality. ""Wanker"" and ""cunt"", are not words that target a specific group of people, they are all purpose words and don't target something specific about someone like their sexuality or the colour of their skin. Those words don't have a history of being used to dehumanize and ostracize an entire group of people, and while things are a lot better today than in the past, that history of ostracizing gay people is by no means over.

Yes, anything can be offensive, which is why it's not about offence. Those words have been and still are used to specifically target gay people, as ""nigger"" was and is, in that spelling, to target black people. It's not about individual offence, it's about a whole group of people being targeted by that word. Calling someone a wanker isn't targeting them because they masturbate, and people aren't bullied or beaten up because they wank. 

Not saying ""faggot"" is not a limit on free speech. Yes, you can make gay jokes, but if the joke is that gay people are inferior or are oppressed, then it's not equal treatment. There are no harmful stereotypes about straight people I can use to make a joke, while there are plenty about gay people. To use another example, a joke saying black people are criminals or are stupid relies on negative stereotype that are used against black people. There are no such harmful stereotypes against white people, ""white people can't dance"" is hardly on the same level as ""black people are stupid"". To use an example of a more American joke, the ""absent black fathers"" joke only works because black people were targeted in The War on Drugs, leading to many young black people being incarcerated and black children growing up without fathers. Without that discrimination, the joke wouldn't work. The joke only works because black people got shit on, and there is no equivalent for white people, I don't even think I could make a joke about white fathers because there's no stereotype to play off. 

It's not about never making gay jokes, but if the joke is ""OP is a faggot"" or relies on the fact that gay people are discriminated against it's not really much of a joke. There's a difference between a gay comedian making gay jokes and a straight one, and that goes for other examples. For example Stephen K Amos makes black and gay jokes, and Omid Djilli makes Asian jokes, but they are done cleverly and are used to poke fun of stereotypes. I'm not saying straight people can never make gay jokes or white people can never make Asian jokes, but if the joke is just shitting on people because they're gay or Asian, it's kind of shitty, you can make clever jokes about those issues that don't rely on just bashing minorities. Straight people don't get shit on in real life for being straight, so bashing straight people in a joke doesn't really equalize it. It's the difference between Simon Amstell making gay jokes, and that joke by Tracy Morgan about beating his son if he was gay.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; Britons are chucking out the equivalent of 24 meals a month, adding up to 4.2 million tonnes of food and drink every year that could have been consumed. Almost half of this is going straight from fridges or cupboards into the bin. One-fifth of what households buy ends up as waste, and around 60% of that could have been eaten.

So of the ""24 meals"" thrown away, half of it is stuff being taken out of the fridge and thrown away directly of which 30% is actually unfit for consumption BUT still counted in the nice eye grabbing ""24 meals"" bit. 

The article also states that the most common items being thrown away are: Milk, Potato's and Bread.   Two items which can have a relatively short shelf life and one item which is often brought in bulk and can have quite a variable shelf life. 

The article also fails to mention what percentage of that 4.2 million tonnes is packaging, for all we know the study is doing something quite daft and counting empty packages as a food item being thrown out (a bottle of coke with just a smidgen inside of it for example).

Ramires I would agree on, but only because there is nobody else that offers that drive and penetration through the middle of the pitch. Frank used to but Ramires has really taken that on.

Setting up life in the UK is mostly hindered by your lack of credit history. That's why you don't get a mobile contract, rental agreement or bank account. 

For mobile phone: go for a PAYG SIM for the first year or so, after that you're usually good for a contract (but not the best offers). 

Bank account: depends on the bank and sometimes on the actual person you're speaking with if they let you open a no-fees current account. Otherwise some banks have account types for new immigrants which ask for a monthly fee, but you can open them right off the boat (or rather, right off Ryanair)

Renting may be harder to crack: if you have a job (with contract and letter from HR), and you're willing to pay a larger than usual deposit, you are all right, going through a normal agency. Otherwise you may have to rent privately, maybe pay cash in hand with no contractual protection.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; You do not understand my perspective, don't claim you do, you provably do not.

Your perspective is that benefits should be given to those seeking to study so that they are able to do so.

&gt; Knowing poor people is not experiencing poverty...If you have not experienced the poverty, who you know is irrelevant.

Aside from the fact that experiencing poverty is not necessary to understand poverty, I have experienced poverty having been homeless and unemployed (which ironically led to me doing a great deal of research in this area and ending up advising the government on these issues).

&gt; No there isn't, but the level of blind ignorance and lack of empathy you are displaying is particularly American. 

Another ad hominem, thanks for reaffirming my point. Incidentally, the concept you are referring to is called delayed gratification and it is unrelated to empathy or America. I'd suggest you do some research about how ability to delay gratification impacts upon life choices as well as it's other benefits.

&gt; it's just those pesky poor people making the wrong life choices, instead of taking on the question of how those people are supposed to get out of that poverty trap

They are supposed to get out of the poverty trap by making sacrifices in the short term for their longer term benefit. I've addressed this repeatedly and unless you are being deliberately obtuse you are fully aware of this.

&gt; Those stupid poor people, why are they wasting time getting an education?! They should be working out dead end jobs their whole lives to pay bills - what use is an education, other than probably helping them to permanently rise out of that dead end job and make a better life for their families.

If you honestly think that is my perspective you are more stupid than I thought. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, I think we both agree that education can be a path out of poverty for some. Choosing whether to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve that education is up to the individual concerned. Your argument is that they should not have to make sacrifices to obtain this education. I hope I shouldn't have to explain why that doesn't work? But if the benefit of the doubt I gave you is misplaced, if something has no cost the result is that demand outstrips supply. In other words there won't be enough to go around.

&gt; despite your own admission that for some people it's impossible to do both, it's somehow still their own stupid fault for being so poor they can't afford it.

So who's fault do you think it is? The Government's? Society's? British culture? If you want something you cannot afford you can either borrow or save (or steal). But you are responsible for that choice, regardless of external factors (unless someone is holding a gun to your head). If you cannot afford an education course either accept the risk of borrowing or make the sacrifices necessary to save up.

&gt; That is your attitude, a pathetic abandonment of the poorest in society, wrapped up in pseudo intellectual rubbish and faux offence-taking.

Again with the abandoning the poorest trope. Where do you get that from? Nothing I've said suggests abandoning them. Is that just how you think people with right wing views think? It isn't. 

&gt; my mocking of you is pretty accurate - and if it isn't, it is purely the fault of the projection of yourself **you** have created.

You don't understand me therefore you create inaccurate assumptions to fill in the gaps in your knowledge instead of asking questions to fill those gaps and it's my fault that your assumptions are wrong? Logic doesn't work that way.

&gt; explain your attitude to the people, who you admitted above are forced to choose between the two

Where people are forced to chose between work and education, choose whichever is best for them. If you want to go to university, for example, weigh up the pro's and con's and make a decision and be prepared to accept the consequences of that decision. If you have two children to care for, your wife ran off with the milkman and the rent is due, perhaps university isn't for you *at this point in time*. On the other hand, if you don't have caring responsibilities, are prepared to move into shared accommodation, take on part time poorly paid work and prepared to accept the risk that work won't always be available, then by all means, do what I did and study.",0,1383826585,null,0,false,0,cd8rzut,t3_1q0rkn,t1_cd8rzut,t1_cd8rn00,null,1428756659,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Most farm machines run on red diesel, which is standard diesel but with a red dye added so you can tell it from the stuff that has all the tax attached.  Occasionally (and somewhat randomly) plod will dip the tanks of a farmers non-farm machinery to make sure they're all legit and above board.   This is why you almost never see a tractor or combined harvester pull up to your local BP station and may actually have a jerry can or two strapped to it if its going any distance on the road. 

So red diesel is the actual ""true cost of diesel"" and what you buy in the forecourts is so expensive compared to it primarily because the Government want to tax it to hell and back.

If that's my perspective, why won't you argue against it and stop talking about choices? I'm talking about people who have this choice - dead end job and no education for life or school but starve.

And the only way to help people like that is get them an education so they can get a better job that would pay more for less hours and allow them to do both, until they don't need more education.

&gt;If you honestly think that is my perspective you are more stupid than I thought.

That's rich, coming from the guy who then types this:

&gt;Choosing whether to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve that education is up to the individual concerned. **Your argument is that they should not have to make sacrifices to obtain this education.**

Absolutely not, I never once made this argument! Copy and paste it please.

You haven't even been reading what I've been posting for fucks sake. I've said if society makes it impossible to do both, then we need to help. If the sacrifice to ""obtain the education"" is ""quit education"" then what sort of sense does that make? 

How hard is that to understand, can you just admit it, that for some people it is literally impossible to make these ""choices"" you harp on about?

And if you will admit it, could you please argue on that basis and not the bullshit you think I'm saying?

&gt;Again with the abandoning the poorest trope. Where do you get that from? Nothing I've said suggests abandoning them. Is that just how you think people with right wing views think? It isn't.

You did, reread your posts. You clearly, repeatedly said if it is impossible for someone to have education and a job at the same time - even if the cause of that inability is not their fault - then they should leave education and get no help from us.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There are ""only rumours"" because you can't prove a backdoor exists because it's closed sourced.

So don't say it is ""proven"" then, as there is no proof.

&gt; For all you know when you run windows it's snapping your web camera and uploading your pictures to a random website. That's hyperbolic and almost 100 percent not true but without access to the source code how can you know 100 hundred percent conclusively know that your operating system is not doing something malicious.

You can't confirm that it is or that it isn't doing something malicious, but my problem was that you said it was ""proven"" when it obviously hasn't been.

&gt; There have been plenty of rumours because this is the same company that gave their encryption keys for hotmail to the NSA and Skype that covertly hands data to government agencies.

This makes more sense - as the need to eavesdrop on email and phone/chat traffic (with a warrant or otherwise) is actually a plausible thing to want. But saying that it has been ""proven"" that all commercial OSes have backdoors is not.

&gt; Exactly my point. People should be flashing open sourced roms whenever they buy a phone not relying a phone manufacturer that fills your phone with shit software and is a ROM you know nothing about.

You're aware that crucial parts of any Android phone, in particular its radio, and probably other things like the GPU, use closed source/proprietary firmware (plus binary blobs in the kernel/userspace to interface with it)? If you want to get paranoid, it sounds like the radio hardware is a great place to have a backdoor - how do you know yours doesn't?

Even with open source software and even if you compile everything yourself (which I bet you don't) there is still the possibility of something malicious being injected. For example, http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack - old, but who knows if it isn't happening today.

&gt; Maybe stop using Arch/Debian and use Linux Mint which is no more or less hassle than Windows or Mac.

I have never used Mint but I doubt that it is massively different to Debian or Ubuntu here, and it will still have the same niggles, compatibility issues, and iffy software.",0,1383828125,null,0,1383829693,0,cd8s8u5,t3_1q2tgu,t1_cd8s8u5,t1_cd8rq2f,null,1428756542,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This paragraph deserves its own reply for its stupidity.

&gt;Where people are forced to chose between work and education, choose whichever is best for them.

You can't be seriously thinking this through, if that is their ""choice"" there is NO choice. They have to choose work or they starve, simple as that. What's best for them is living.

Can you understand that? And if you can, can't you understand how shit a choice that is, and why would you be happy living in a society as callous and horrible as that?

Also, don't give typical right wing useless examples of people who would have enough money if they saved somehow, I never ever said they deserve money. I specifically said people who have to pick between work and education NOT work/family costs/accommodation and education.

You aren't even an honest debater, you just make up nonsense and throw it out there.

But even then, your example is rubbish:
&gt;If you have two children to care for, your wife ran off with the milkman and the rent is due, perhaps university isn't for you at this point in time.

So you don't want to help that person and their children? Fuck them in other words? So you are just a horrible person, it's not political at all?

Finally, you round it all off with your tired old ""I did it, so should they"". Well, I'm glad society has reached its pinnacle and no changes are required. This attitude is the worst one any modern person can hold - a grudge that because they struggled everyone else should too. Get over it, life was unfair to you, have some compassion for others.

I *have* been arguing against it.

&gt; I'm talking about people who have this choice - dead end job and no education for life or school but starve...And the only way to help people like that is get them an education so they can get a better job that would pay more for less hours and allow them to do both, until they don't need more education.

Again, we are advocating the same outcome. My way to achieve this is through the individual choosing (choices again, I know) whether to take the risk of studying or not.

&gt; &gt; **Your argument is that they should not have to make sacrifices to obtain this education.**

&gt; Absolutely not, I never once made this argument! Copy and paste it please.

As requested:

""the only way to help people like that is get them an education so they can get a better job that would pay more for less hours and allow them to do both""

""I've said if society makes it impossible to do both, then we need to help.""

Quotes aside, you are arguing against what I am saying.

&gt; How hard is that to understand, can you just admit it, that for some people it is literally impossible to make these ""choices"" you harp on about?

People have choices. There are loans, scholarships, grants, bursaries, awards, training funds, etc. to help those in need. A friend of mine applied for funding from The Rotary Club to do some research and they helped her out with it. But it is up to the individual to obtain the resources they need for them to study, not the taxpayer (beyond compulsory education).

&gt; You clearly, repeatedly said if it is impossible for someone to have education and a job at the same time

&gt;&gt;Absolutely not, I never once made this argument! Copy and paste it please.

""the only way to help people like that is get them an education so they can get a better job that would pay more for less hours and allow them to do both""
""I've said if society makes it impossible to do both, then we need to help.""

Excuse me, can you clarify how exactly those phrases translate in to ""they should not have to make sacrifices to obtain this education"". They don't by the way, they are not equivalent statements.

Once again, you have this idea that they can just make sacrifices - I am not talking about someone who is spending £50 a month on cigarettes who could just save some money, or who could move from a double room to a single. I'm talking about someone who has already made every sacrifice they can, and cannot afford to get an education, where it is impossible because of the way our society works.

People like that exist, you cannot deny it, so please explain the choices they apparently have, and also I would like to know why you don't want to help them? Do you just have no compassion? Is it that you think they are lazy, or that you just don't care?

&gt;People have choices. There are loans, scholarships, grants, bursaries, awards, training funds, etc. to help those in need. 

Sure, because someone who has an inferior education and needs a better one is going to win an award or a scholarship - and lets remember how all these things like prizes and grants are infinite and everybody who needs it will get it.

true,Nessunolosa,cnty-uk,"Previously USA in London ","It's different, but one thing to keep in mind is that huge swaths of the States are far poorer than the UK. It's such a huge country that the averages are brought up by wealthier areas. 

Sure, in some parts of the US you can buy a house and have a shitload of space, a dryer, and a car...but you might have absolutely nothing to do. The US is incredibly isolating and in many places, there ain't shit to do except sit around in front of the TV and get fatter. There aren't even sidewalks in most places, so it's impossible to get around without a car. People from the US tend to spend a LOT more on gas, electricity, and petrol than in the UK (huge levies on petrol here notwithstanding) due to the huge amount of use. People crank the heating up all the time, and in summer use air conditioners like there is no tomorrow. 

It's expensive in the UK, but the cost is also brought down in a certain sense by earning in pounds. Statesians complain about the prices here because they are high if one's savings are in dollars. It's still a high cost of living if one earns in pounds, but it's relatively lower overall. 

The US may have a higher GDP, but since trickle-down economics don't really work that doesn't equate with an overall higher takehome income. By some indications like the [Big Mac Index](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Big_Mac_index_50USD_2columns.png) aspects of life in the UK are cheaper than in the US and that may compensate somewhat for the differences in straight salaries. Statesians are definitely not awash in savings. In fact, savings are at record lows. Personal debt is higher than ever, and the average individual owes tens of thousands of dollars. It far outstrips UK average personal debt, even though that it pretty high. 

One might ask where all the money is going in the US, and the answer is probably healthcare. The single fastest way into bankruptcy in the States is to get sick, or to have a child who gets sick. Even with the Affordable Care Act and changes to insurance, it's going to be at least a few thousand dollars for most young healthy people, and far more for those with pre-existing conditions like your truly and those with families. 

I left the States because the economic crisis made it impossible to get a job that wasn't essentially zero-contract without benefits or abroad. I am lucky enough to have come from a relatively well-off family, but this generation's expectations about things like having a dryer at home have been significantly lowered. I would probably have the same or worse standard of living here as back there, and because I'm from an area that is expensive, I'd be paying nearly as much. 

This turned into a novel, sorry. Basically, it depends completely on where in the States one is and what exactly one wants to buy/have.          ",0,1383829934,null,0,false,0,cd8sl2r,t3_1q0jts,t1_cd8sl2r,t1_cd856af,null,1428756313,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Including blobs for the radio and any other hardware that need it? Can you compile your own firmware for all of the hardware inside?

The Pandora doesn't seem like a ringing endorsement - isn't that the really really expensive device that took years to achieve manufacture in quantity and isn't anything special in hardware terms?

&gt; Replicant exists as a completely open alternative to android - it just doesn't use certain pieces of hardware which require closed blob software.

That's the OS - but I am talking about the hardware which will run its own proprietary firmware and may still need proprietary blobs to interface with it.

Never said it did. You'd be wrong though.

&gt;Then you're foolish for being distracted from the real culprits that start wars you consider bad.

Not sure what the point of replying to this comment is, but I will. I didn't even speak about that so why bring it up? You can't just reply to something I didn't say, that's not how discussion works. You're stating an opinion you deem me or others to have as fact when that opinion hasn't even been suggested.

&gt;Just the truth, only reddit could mark Remembrance Day by calling soldiers baby killers and saying the RBL is Government propaganda to recruit children, it'd be funny if it wasn't so pathetic.

Sorry, again what does this have to do with anything I said? I think perhaps the problem you have with reddit is that you argue against points that aren't even mentioned. You also seem to have made the mistake of forgetting that reddit is made up of many different people with many different opinions. 

You aren't really bringing anything to this discussion. I could just as easily say ""well reddit says anyone that disagrees with war should be jailed typical right wing reddit bias"" as I'm sure someone on this site has said that somewhere. It's childish and you aren't giving this sensitive subject the respect of dialogue that it deserves.

At school and college I was pretty much taught that university was the way. I had zero awareness of other paths such as apprenticeships, and always assumed they were just for roles like being a plumber or an electrician.

I started studying when tuition fees were still around £3,200. Say what you want about student debt but thankfully I don't have to start paying it back until I am earning at least £14,000. It's not like the US system where you have to pay it off like a normal loan.

Yes, even the £9,000 per year tuition fees seem daunting at first but you do not have to pay said loan off until you are earning at least £21,000 per year, which in this current economic climate I am sure very few newly employed graduates outside of London are earning.

&gt; I'm just wondering how you evaluated that choice now that you are - like me - on the other side.

If you want an evaluation, here's one. It was a waste of three years when an apprenticeship, which could have been taken at a more advanced level after college, would have landed me closer to actual job opportunities. Loads and loads of people have degrees now meaning that employers can afford to basically say ""Some 2:1s are more equal than others"" by factoring in whether you've had high GCSE/A Level results or not, and with apprenticeship schemes demanding the employer fund the training of anybody university educated, the incentive to switch is lost from the employer's perspective.",0,1383831293,null,0,1383831551,0,cd8svw7,t3_1q1bpe,t1_cd8svw7,t1_cd8pyqr,null,1428756172,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; we're still using buses and trains that were in service 20 years ago

The main reason we don't use steam driven trains is not that steam was 'old' it was actually because it was exceptionally labour intensive, electrifying and replacing the engines was actually cheaper in the long term.   

Does one of those mini buses running on a low volume route need to be shiny and new, so long as its well maintained and works in accordance with legislation? 

Same with trains, what advantage does the new one confer?  Goes faster is the usual answer and whilst that may be true (it does have a higher top speed) that 20 year old train might not be able to run at its full speed due to limitations with the rails or route. 

Besides which 20 years isn't actually THAT old, for either a human or mechanical device.   A 20 year old computer might well be obsolete but Moore's Law only applies to such things.

1 - I think that it should be unnecessary for charity to be required to take care of injured members of the armed forces. If someone's injured at war and can't work or need support to do so, they should receive some sort of pension or appropriate care.

2 - I feel that it's propaganda aimed at the armed services to glorify the notion of dying for your country and is used as a psychological tool. They're not the 'glorious dead' they're the dead dead. Because some politician decided they needed to be risked. War should be a last resort, not a tool of business protectionism. That's not to take anything away from the people who went and fought and died, but see item 3 below.

3 - It salves the consciences of politicians that know they're sending people to die, to be able to stick a plastic poppy wreath on a bit of concrete. They should instead be looking at ways to address item 1 here before they should be able to get away with that.

4 - The social pressure to conform to the idea of wearing a poppy and paying lip service to supporting remembrance day activities is frequently unthinking and reactionary. I was called an imbecilic twat by someone on here for stating my concerns based on the above by someone who didn't really have an answer to the *actual* points I was making.

5 - People went - and go to - war ostensibly to protect 'freedom'. That should include not having to adopt symbols.

&gt; Bullshit. How come Firefox is the best performing web browser? Or that Android and Mac OSX run off the Linux kernel????!!!! Or that the majority of web servers are powered by linux? Or the fact the most powerful computers in the world use linux?[1]

I said that ""it isn't always a replacement"". You have cherry picked the better examples of open source software (servers, Firefox) while you miss the bigger impacting ones like use on the desktop. Linux is fantastic on servers and huge clusters where it is being administered by someone who knows what they are doing, but I was on about desktops where inexperienced users have to put up with complicated fixes for problems that shouldn't exist and don't exist on other platforms. It also works well when it's supplied as part of a system, like an Android phone or a Chromebook where the hard work has been done for you.

OS X isn't Linux based btw, it uses the Darwin kernel which is written by Apple and is actually open source too. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)

&gt; You're just wilfully ignorant in your world view despite the fact your statements are outright lies.

They aren't lies. Can you prove that they are? I like to be technically correct and I am fairly sure I am. 

&gt; The biggest mobile operating system right now is a Linux operating system (Android). The one after it is still based off the (IPhone) linux kernel.

The iPhone runs a mobile version of OS X which is not Linux based. I understand that Android uses the Linux kernel but pretty much everything else is Android specific.

Have you noticed a theme here? Firefox and Android are good examples of open source software, but both are driven and heavily contributed to by employees of major companies who control the project and set its direction and just happen to make it open source. 

&gt; The N900 is completely open - not one binary blob is used to run it. 

Even inside the hardware? You might not need blobs in the kernel or in the userspace but I am talking about the firmware that runs on things like its radio, which the user doesn't really need to recompile or touch (this is true for Android too).

true,[deleted],null,null,"First off, you're right about Willian playing on the right and Hazard playing on the left. Yesterday it was Schürrle who played instead of Hazard, while Willian played instead of Mata. 

Secondly, Willian offers far more defensively than Hazard does. One example is how Hazard constantly left Cole exposed against Everton earlier this year. Willian and Schürrle are perfect Mourinho-type players, as they offer a lot defensively. They track back and know how to tackle and when to not tackle. Examples of this are Schürrle's match against Bayern Münich in the Super Cup and Willian just yesterday against Schalke. 

I'm gonna go a little off-topic here and drop some #jewelz for you who don't like tactics. Mata and Hazard are both somewhat struggling to adapt to this philosophy, but we are lucky to have such proffesionals. Despite the media's attempt to create a player mutiny they have both come out and say that they are willing to adapt and improve. Juan Mata in particular has improved immensively in his defensive game. [Here's Juan Mata not covering Michael Carrick in a FA Cup against Manchester United last season.](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1660587/iK5CVsGIAvnEf.gif) This season, Mata would've prevented this goal, as he would've tracked Carrick immediately. And the best of this, is that Mata recognizes that his defensive game needs improvement and played his heart out against Swindon and Arsenal. So, yeah, while Schürrle and Willian don't offer as much creatively as Hazard and Mata, they are much better defensively than Hazard and Mata are offensively. Expect to see various combo's of these four with Oscar as the 10/Central Attack Midfielder. I still don't know what's happening with De Bruyne, he's been pretty poor in all his matches, so I hope Mourinho has a plan for him.

It essentially absorbed the left leaning National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers which campaigned for war pensions etc (and excluded officers from membership) and the explicitly right-wing/nationalist counterparts. The slogan of the former was ""justice not charity.""

The popular memory of that war is epitomised by the likes of Wilfred Owen ""futility"" or Siegfried Sassoon's poem about the [cenotaph](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/at-the-cenotaph/) which explictly politicised remembrance. That wasn't necessarily new. George Orwell once famously observed that the most stirring British war poem is about a brigade of cavalry that charged the wrong way.

The coexistence of that typically British gut anti-militarism with commemoration of wartime heroism / service of the British state / the armed forces has always been an uncomfortable one to say the least. 

Each new conflict - and more importantly the popular perception of the conflict - changes the dynamic. From the troubles in Ireland, to the ""liberal intervention"" of the last few decades. In particular, current reverence for soldiers who have served in the Middle East is often co-existent with a real anger at the politicians who sent them to fight there.

The problem for people who are explicitly against poppies or the RBL is that the poppy is defined by the mass of people that wear it, rather than necessarily the history or the RBL as such. That definition is complex - and not simply reducible to ""pro"" or ""anti"" war politics, either specific or general.

&gt;There seems to be an undercurrent of distrust and often downright scorn towards the British Legion.

Well let me use on example. In Liverpool a few years ago the British Legion and other ex-services joined a protest against an Irish Republican march which turned violence.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; I suppose stealing adverts from other websites lets them magically stay on target for listing a certain amount of new jobs each day.

And the scraper sites get to appear largely from nowhere yet have ""8.2 million vacancies"" (most expired and all from somewhere else).  Which looks good when you wave it under a techno-numptie like IDS's nose with a contract for him to sign.

&gt; Are there any requirements/cost for a company to list a job directly on UJM?

Unsure myself, although I remember a comment from someone on here trying to put an advert up through UJM.  Whilst he didn't mention costs he did pretty much say it was a 5 page online form and it threw a hissy fit with every page he tried to submit. 

Beyond that I've seen a lot of what seem to be one-man-band's advertising for a helper so no, I don't believe there are any major requirements for listing a position.

They didn’t all sign up to go across the globe and shoot people, many will have signed up before the recent wars and reasonably assumed they would only go to war if it is was in the countries best interest or at least morally justified. 

&gt;While I think the Government that sends them there should fully support them when they get back, they certainly shouldn't expect support or respect from the average citizen.

I don’t believe the government does give enough support to veterans, especially in the age of austerity, so it is important that charities like the British Legion exist.  Yes they are doing a job that they signed up for, but it’s a difficult job where their lives are in danger. I do think they deserve a little respect, without going the other way, and worshipping them as Heroes.

&gt;The military can train people up and you can leave quite skilled. But personally I'd rather starve than get skilled up while being part of killing others.

If you are a complete pacifist then I can see why you would not want to give any additional support to veterans.  However most people would agree that war is sometimes necessary, or at least that the armed forces are sometimes a force for good.

""The Doctors embark on their greatest adventure in this 50th anniversary special. In 2013, something terrible is awakening in London’s National Gallery; in 1562, a murderous plot is afoot in Elizabethan England; and somewhere in space an ancient battle reaches its devastating conclusion. All of reality is at stake as the Doctor’s own dangerous past comes back to haunt him"".


Gives nothing of significance away.

Really, Gulf war started around 1990.

If they thought they'd only go to war because it's ""in our best interest"" then then nothing changes, they give their body for £16k.  We have the internet, they can do their own research about what's going on.

&gt; If you are a complete pacifist then I can see why you would not want to give any additional support to veterans. However most people would agree that war is sometimes necessary, or at least that the armed forces are sometimes a force for good. To me, saying war is bad so I don’t want to support veterans is a cop out. 

I'm not a pacifist and I certainly don't think that people that have signed their life away shouldn't be supported by the Government that send them there.

Nor do I think that the armed aren't always ""a force for good"".  But it's been a long time since that was the case IMO.

War is bad.  I'm actually ok with supporting those that served many years ago.  I don't feel that way about people that signed up recently though.  I pity them, I have anger towards the Government, but I won't support them either.

There is a massive amount we can do to improve our party political system to make it more representative and efficacious (See Douglas Carswell's and Daniel Hannan's suggestions for a start) but just giving up on the system as it is because it is imperfect without advocating a replacement is just intellectually dishonest.

No, in my analogy the person would just have to be speeding (doing something illegal).

true,cnxixo,null,null,"&gt;The Lib Dem leader, appearing on his regular LBC radio phone-in, said that not voting in elections was a total ""abdication of responsibility"".

This implies that voting automatically gives you responsibility for the actions of those elected - is this not nonsense? If I live in a Tory constituency, and vote for the Green candidate, am I responsible for the actions of the Tory government? Are the voters among the million who marched against the Iraq war responsible for it because they voted?

Until politicians can come up with a truly valid answer to these sorts of questions - about the millions of voters who have literally never had an elected representative they voted for, about the fact that the pool of ""electable"" people is tiny and generally from the same backgrounds, or that a critical mass of people with a certain opinion can live in a country but spread out so it is impossible for them to have elected representation - then populists like Russell Brand will have a huge audience.

Is a parliamentary democracy first created hundreds of years ago still relevant in a modern world in the same form?

A lot of the posting here has focused on Brands personality, or on the fact that what he is saying are things brought up countless times before by socialists and revolutionaries - I think the discussion would be better served on how it is that a celebrity comedian can generate vastly more political debate among young people than any politician has managed in the last 3 decades.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Excuse me, can you clarify how exactly those phrases translate in to ""they should not have to make sacrifices to obtain this education"". They don't by the way, they are not equivalent statements.

&gt; &gt; *I am not talking about someone who is spending £50 a month on cigarettes who could just save some money, or who could move from a double room to a single. I'm talking about someone who has already made every sacrifice they can, and cannot afford to get an education*

If people are not in a position to make sacrifices how can they make them? You've answered your own question.

&gt; please explain the choices they* apparently have

&gt; They being: someone who has already made every sacrifice they can, and cannot afford to get an education

My argument is that people in the situation you described need to either a) borrow b) obtain sponsorship or c) save.

&gt; also I would like to know why you don't want to help them? Do you just have no compassion? Is it that you think they are lazy, or that you just don't care?

I think this statement by you gets to the heart of our disagreement about the means to achieve poverty reduction. My belief is that regardless of external forces individuals need to put in their own effort to change their circumstances. I do want to help them, but only if they are prepared to help themselves. I don't want to help them for the sake of helping them. I believe it must be a two way street with the deserving being helped and those who aren't serious, committed or prepared to invest themselves (whether through time, effort or whatever) not being helped to waste very limited resources that would be better directed to someone who wasn't halfheartedly going about it.

In other words, it isn't that I lack compassion, think they are lazy or that I don't care. I care very much that the right resources go to the right people and that these resources aren't wasted.

&gt; someone who has an inferior education and needs a better one is going to win an award or a scholarship

In my experience, most scholarships are non-academic. Whether they be for people attending their local education establishment, people studying a particular subject, people of certain ethnicites, women, disabled people, etc. there are plenty of funding options. Certainly bursaries are aimed at those how otherwise couldn't afford to study. And as you can see I listed a host of options, not just academic scholarships.

&gt; Typical right wing solution, rely on the goodness of people, despite the centuries of evidence that it does not work &amp; only government reforms have lasting effects.

Education has a cost. To obtain it you have to pay that cost. Millions of students do this each year in this country alone. Students are not generally the richest group in society.

No two people have exactly the same level of access. That's life.

The point of Whips is to stop shit like that happening. It is to ensure that the basic acts of government get done quickly and efficiently with little trouble.

Now, I don't massively like the whip system, in fact I find it largely anti-democratic. But we have a direct trade-off between the functionality of government in actually achieving stuff for people and each individual member getting exactly what they want.

I realise it isn't exactly cool and sexy, but the majority of the problems which came up with things like the creation of the NHS and the welfare state were pretty sizeable and required a strong base of unconditional support to get it through the hard times, which was what the whip is there for.

They are invaluable for getting people to support things rather than taking a more cautious and restrained approach of fence sitting which usually ends up with nothing happening.

I'm not saying we don't need to reform the whips, but we need something to do the job they currently do rather than just assuming they currently do nothing.

true,cnxixo,null,null,"&gt;My belief is that regardless of external forces individuals need to put in their own effort to change their circumstances. I do want to help them, but only if they are prepared to help themselves. 

This is our core disagreement - you seem to think that everyone has it within them to help themselves. You are too literal a believer in ""we are all born equal""!

You are ignoring that some people have been brought up, their whole lives, in communities where crime was rampant, unemployment high, they have had parents in and out of prison, they have spent their whole lives at the bottom of society and are completely hopeless. These people are immediately at a huge disadvantage.

They may not have similar education skills to you, they may not be able to write the required letters to get these grants and things, they may even simply be less able than you are and when combined with bad circumstances have no chance.

I was lucky, my family was middle class, my parents both well educated, strong marriage, no criminal records, my school was excellent, none of my friends went to prison etc. I know this is not the case for everyone, so I can't apply my standards.

What you are neglecting to acknowledge is an entire group of people who don't think they are worth anything, they aren't prepared to help themselves because they don't even think they can! 

Look, in the end, helping these people get education is a long term tax boon. They go in to better jobs, pass this on to their children, and stop drawing welfare. It should be a conservative policy!

&gt;How do you think the government reforms came about? It wasn't all left, left, left you know. Besides, philanthropy has worked and there is centuries of evidence to prove it. Bill Gates isn't the only example.

Most major reforms in society which have benefitted the poor have come from government, perhaps started philanthropically, but always taken over by the state due to the fact that relying on the kindness of people is inconsistent at best.

There is no real incentive for private individuals to help the poor, and betting it all on your generation having its own Bill Gates - and also that their chosen cause is young people who need education - seems like taking way too big a gamble with millions of peoples lives.

&gt; *Main Core is the code name of a database maintained since the 1980s by the federal government of the United States. Main Core contains personal and financial data of millions of U.S. citizens believed to be threats to national security. The data, which comes from the NSA, FBI, CIA, and other sources, is collected and stored without warrants or court orders. The database's name derives from the fact that it contains ""copies of the 'main core' or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence community.""*

&gt; *As of 2008 there were reportedly eight million Americans listed in the database as possible threats, often for trivial reasons, whom the government may choose to track, question, or detain in a time of crisis.*

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; You are ignoring that some people have been brought up, their whole lives, in communities where crime was rampant, unemployment high, they have had parents in and out of prison, they have spent their whole lives at the bottom of society and are completely hopeless. These people are immediately at a huge disadvantage.

&gt; What you are neglecting to acknowledge is an entire group of people who don't think they are worth anything, they aren't prepared to help themselves because they don't even think they can! 

There is an underclass in society, brought about largely, as you acknowledge, by anti-establishment culture. I grew up amongst this class and know that there were a number of individuals who didn't fit the mould of born-scum, live-as-scum, die-as-scum that many others do fulfill. Plenty of resources are thrown at this group through outreach programmes, community initiatives and so forth. Some of it gets through to the right people but also a lot of it is taken advantage of and wasted. 

My belief is that resources are precious and need to be targeted at the right people. Yours seems to be that it is more important that people don't slip through the net and so a blanket approach is needed. Neither approach is perfect, both have their pro's and con's. 

I did not have an easy upbringing, certainly nothing like yours, but having experienced such a childhood I know only too well that the only way out of such a life is to commit to getting out of it.

true,DirtySketel,eng-merseyside,Liverpool,"Friend, this is absolutely my experience of the pub industry too. I only worked in one pub, but it had a busy kitchen, and everything you described and more was commonplace. Mine was a Stonegate pub.

I made a post about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1ivpze/just_stressing_a_bit_not_sure_what_to_do/) (it was a throwaway at the time but I don't care now and I've forgotten the password).

tl;dr, where I worked we had:

* Food served off the floor, raw and cooked.
* Doctoring date labels so the food ‘never goes out of date’, or out of date food just decanted into containers with no label
* Cross contamination everywhere, the same chopping boards and knives used for every task.
* Dishwashing in the loosest sense of the word (dirt on the plate? lick your finger and rub it off)
* Vegetarian food cooked alongside meat and fish.

What's most interesting is what happened when I tried to do something about it. The management at the pub was well aware of all this, and encouraged it to save stocks. But the manager was on maternity leave and we had a stand-in. Firstly, I tried reporting it to my area manager. She told me it was unacceptable, but no further action was taken. Then I tried going to the stand-in manager, explaining what was going on. He told me to do what I thought was best to improve the situation, especially regarding out-of-date food being sent out etc.

So I started compiling lists of how to safely store all the food and for how long, and that day I purged the kitchen and removed all out of date stock, or stock whose date I didn't know because the label had been changed so often. I kept this up for a little while, until I started getting visits from managers saying that this couldn't go on.

Apparently the area manager only had to pretend to care about these things — she knew it was going on in all her sites, but it was a game she had to play to keep up appearances. An assistant manager told me that it was like this in every pub he'd ever worked in — it's just the way the industry is. Also, the internal inspectors NSF (whatever it stands for) were all ex-pub staff anyway, so they all know it's going on really, so the inspections are mostly just for show, which is why we consistently got good results just by lying when they came for inspections. 

I was basically made to feel really small and naïve for thinking that this was a problem or that it was something I can change. I was told it was like this everywhere, and people don't get ill, so it's not a problem.

That said, I think it was a bit daft on Rodgers part to go and appoint Agger VC if the CB they were looking to recruit was going to be a left side CB.

We've all discussed whether two left footed CBs can play together (and I think they can) but perhaps Rodgers doesn't or one of them has shown an inability to play together. I don't know.

Personally, Agger and Skrtel, for me, are both relatively error-prone defenders. Neither is good enough in the air and their jaunts forward rarely result in any positive attack. 

Right now our best back two is Toure (despite his cock up the other day) and Sahko. Is there a point to playing Toure when Agger might internally demand a move? To be honest, I think we overrate Agger on this sub, mostly because he's actually shown himself to be committed to the club and the great YNWA on his knuckles.

I've never understand the Barca interest and only think its because he's a decent dribbler and Denmark's captain. If we could sell him I wouldn't call it a bad idea.

Agger has made mistakes for us under Rodgers but under Kenny and Rafa he was well worth the hype. He seems to lack concentration, perhaps Carra was the perfect partner for him (and Skrtel). 

I think you have a point in that those clean sheets had more to do with Mignolet than Agger, but Agger is the only centre back we have that looks comfortable with the ball at feet. He can alleviate pressure by playing out from the back rather than lumping it forward for our two fairly small forwards to chase.

I can't believe you suggest selling Agger and promoting Wisdom would be a good idea, Wisdom (despite obviously being young) has shown nothing that merits such faith.

I agree in general though, I'm not seeing the high level of performance from Skrtel that warrants him staying in the team. To make up for his limitations on the ball he would need to be outstanding defensively, he's done okay, but not great, with a few mistakes as well. In comparison, Sakho has immense physicality and Toure strong leadership and organisational skills. And both are better on the ball than Skrtel.

Skrtel (and Mignolet) is also one of the reasons we're playing three at the back as it gives skrtel passing options either side rather than having to go back to mignolet whose distribution is also poor. Not that skrtel has done badly, but is he playing well enough to warrant accommodating the formation around him? I don't think so.

Any defensive pairing involving Agger, Sakho or Toure should be comfortable enough on the ball to not require a third centre half as a passing outlet, allowing us to play out from the back even under pressure.",0,1383854072,null,0,false,0,cd91uik,t3_1q4c4y,t1_cd91uik,t3_1q4c4y,null,1428751979,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

So the driver for lower rents is the practical concern that unoccupied land is extremely expensive. While the driver for higher rents is short term greed.

The first landowner to raise rents becomes the first to pay a tax with no income to support it, and the first to go bankrupt and lose the land. Then a landlord can purchase the land and charge a rent that will both pay the land tax, and allow for full occupancy.

It's kind of funny how varied the responses that I get on this topic are. Guess that's to be expected, though. Mind stating how you feel that things get worse from S.3 to S.4? I'm leery of watching the rest of S.3 as it is....

And as for Rudy, he's the cause of another big split that I've seen in the Misfits fandom. While some clearly like him (he's in the sidebar), I feel at this point (having just started S.3) that his character feels like a rushed attempt to fill the void that Nathan left. To me, Nathan was a shameless, annoying, bullying asshole who managed to pair these traits with real wit and comedic timing so skillfully that I couldn't help but like the guy. Rudy, so far, is shameless and annoying.

I feel that this issue comes from a drastic change in comedic pacing coming from S.2 to S.3. Nearly every time he's on screen in the first episode, Rudy feels the need to reaffirm his passion for sodomy. I found the same issue with Kelly, really; they scooped out all the meaningful things that she might have said in favor of a service announcement pertaining to the fact that despite her poor elocution, this girl is, in fact, a rocket scientist. Assaulting expired equines for an hour is not the best formula for laughs, in my experience.

The dramatic timing, I feel, was likewise skewed; with Nathan, the writers seemed happy to let the character initially stand on the merits of his humor, and to develop reasons to sympathize with him over the course of two seasons.  With Rudy, it feels like yeahhe'sanassholebutAlishabrokehisheartsoyoushouldfindhimfunnyandlikehimgo.


I understand that Nathan was important to the appeal of the show, but I don't know if treating his absence like a gushing hole in the side of the hull that needed to be patched asap was the best way to go.

&gt;You are a British citizen by descent if:

    You are born outside the UK to a parent who was a British citizen at the time;
    It does not matter whether the birth took place before or after 1 January 1983 as long as a child who was born before that date became a British citizen on that date;
    On 31 December 1982, he or she was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies

so if your father was a british citizen on that date, then probably yes, otherwise, not sure.

I could see us getting a striker to replace him if possible (rooney, Lewandowski, ??) but i fell bad keeping ba since he could start for half the other premier league teams. 

In the attacking midfield, I can see someone going out on loan, possibly de bruyne, i love all of our midfielders but shrulle, oscar, and hazard have reinforced their positions, and willian just got here. Mata will hopefully stay but he definitely needs more playing time (not just cause I love him but he has to stay match fit) 

In the defensive midfield, i wouldnt be surprised if essien left but I know he loves mourinho so i think he will stay, I agree with psikk that mikel is not a world class midfielder. he is a great third option but we need more talent and less depth. IN two or three years van ginkel could theoretically take the position, but he needs to recover and prove himself. I wouldnt be opposed to getting and older midfielder (Alonso??) to help for a few years. 

On defense, I agree we need a new leftback but definitely not in January. If cole is healthy few can beat him and betrand is a good backup. We can also play Dave there who looked great in his past few matches there. I think we will get a new CB over the summer to transition Terry out but I dont think we need one unless someone gets injured (Ivanovic can always move back over)

true,SawRub,orange,SAVE ME BARRY,"I think the reason why season 3 worked was that over seasons 1 and 2 they slowly developed Simon enough that he could work as a central character instead of Nathan. It was the same writing team, mostly same cast, and the Nathan actor wanted to leave to become a famous movie actor.

I think most people who were aware of Nathan leaving had mentally prepared themselves for a different show. Nathan carried a bulk of the jokes of season 1 and 2, so maybe it was just the loss of his character that made the humor seem different. People who weren't aware of Nathan leaving, got a shock of their lives when their favorite character didn't show up, and assumed the writers wrote him out, and hated them for it.

In season 4, it was an almost all new cast, and the new cast was actually quite talented, but unfortunately the writing just wasn't strong or funny enough. Curtis was too boring to be a suitable lead, and Rudy was no original member, so it didn't even have a strong central original member character.

From what I've seen, even people who hate season 3 grudgingly accept that Rudy was actually surprisingly good. When I first saw him and heard him speak I couldn't believe they had the balls to replace Nathan with just another crass dude with an accent, but he won me over.

Season 5 so far has been pretty good though, but it's the last season.

Another major thing is people who just started watching it around the beginning of season 3 and later.

These people watched all the episodes back to back. So instead of an episode a week and then forgetting about it for a while, they got to watch it back to back. So it wasn't new adventures every week, it was one big 2 season long adventure. So when the show changed in season 3 it came as a bigger shock, because obviously, it felt like a different show.

I watched Misfits seasons 1 and 2 back to back, which is why when season 3 first began, despite preparing myself for Nathan leaving, I wasn't too happy, but I stuck with it and I enjoyed it.",0,1383857689,null,0,false,0,cd93j12,t3_1q0lyg,t1_cd93j12,t1_cd92un4,null,1428751195,2,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,2

What system works without political parties? I don't know of any, and all it would result in is MPs with common opinions making handshake deals behind the bike sheds. If your aim is less transparency, then I think it's a great idea. 

I still like FPTP. Coalitions, by their very nature, lead to weak wishy-washy leadership. I think it's far better to let the Captain take the helm and be decisive. It's also far easier to know who to point the finger at when things go pear-shaped. 

At the moment we have an encumber Tory party who will always have the excuse of saying ""Blame Clegg"". We aren't privileged enough to really know what Cameron thinks, and he has an automatic get out clause whenever it's convenient. 

I'd stick with FPTP, but the only thing I'd change is that if we get a coalition, the term is halved to 2.5 years. A coalition is an indication of a dissatisfied public (ignoring boundary changes).

If we get De Rossi/Khedira/Alonso I wouldn't be surprised if Essien or Mikel are loaned/sold as surplus as both of their national teams will need them on the field prior to the world cup if they qualify.

true,AimHere,null,null,"Those are really bad counterexamples, since the root causes of both conflicts were historical crimes of the British military. With the Falklands, the root cause was a spot of 19th century ethnic cleansing when we decided to turf a bunch of settlers out of their homes and install British colonists. The Argentinian invasion was wrong, primarily because the statute of limitations had long passed and the current settlers weren't responsible for their ancestor's crimes, but it sets an ugly precedent. If word gets round that all you have to do is hang on to someone else's land for a few decades and it's then ""legitimately"" yours, then it lays the foundations for the likes of the ethnic cleansing strategies in the Balkans, or the Israeli settlement program in occupied Palestine.

With Ireland, we were just sorting out the mess caused by about 800 years of invasions, interventions, and atrocities. The historical crimes of the British army are also compounded by not so historical ones, in that sections of the British miltary and police force were closely co-operating with, if not actually running, Loyalist death squads, like the [Glenanne gang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenanne_gang) and the UDA unit that [Brian Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Nelson_%28Northern_Irish_loyalist%29) answered to.

You might also note that Northern Ireland isn't the case of repelling foreign invaders from British soil, but forcing a group of people to be ruled by Britain against their will. Hardly a fine upstanding use of any kind of army, surely, even if you disregard it's terror tactics over the years. (The alternative, of course, is to force some people to be governed by the Republic of Ireland against their will and that would likely cause even worse problems; the situation is just a complete clusterfuck, caused mostly by the people who've been running the islands for the last millenium.)

It takes an insane amount of effort and requires long term commitment, dedication, loyalty to a cause and compromise to get bills, laws and everything passed the commons?

The point of political parties is to overcome these collective action problems, to create vehicles of change which can have a meaningful impact and create groups of mps to actually do things rather than sit around all day.

You could have direct representation and when things went wrong you could only blame yourselfs.

This would allow people to decide on individual issues and not be forced to compromise from a two or three  party set of policy packages.

But also anyone could submit an idea and be taken seriously if it had legs.

Lie is a strong word. Would they exaggerate? Yes, [this has already been proven](http://www.propublica.org/article/claim-on-attacks-thwarted-by-nsa-spreads-despite-lack-of-evidence). Don't forget they (I am referring to the NSA and GCHQ here, as they have evidently been working in tandem) have lied about countless other things. For example, they assured us such techniques were only used to target enemies of the state, then we find out that they were spying on Petrobras. Then the Americans assured us that they weren't using the techniques to spy on their own people, and it turned out that this was because they got GCHQ to do that for them.


It would be far easier to trust the intelligence services if they haven't proven their word to be so untrustworthy

true,AimHere,null,null,"&gt;the Argentines were expelled by Americans in retaliation for the seizure of their ship.

If you're going to accuse me of revisionism, then you at least want to get your facts right. The settlers were displaced by the Royal Navy. not by the USA, whose boats were seized. When a third party unilaterally wanders into a dispute and settles the dispute by taking over the islands themselves, that looks almost nothing like 'retaliation' and much more like 'opportunist land grab'.

&gt;But the Argentine settlers where imperialist as well there is no crimes in the way your implying.

The Spanish settlers inhabited land that was previously empty/abandoned. They didn't displace people. The British displaced them. That is the crime I'm talking about - actual crimes against people (if you forcibly deport enough people, it's considered a crime against humanity). I couldn't care less who plants what flag where.

&gt;It's also worth noting that our large military probably has a fair amount to do with why we haven't been threatened more. the bigger factor being the US/ NATO

There are countries with larger armies that are invaded more (Vietnam, say, or Iraq which famously had the 4th largest army in the world and whose territory was invaded 3 times in 25 years), and there are countries with smaller militaries and no NATO that don't get invaded at all (Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland in Western Europe, say). I don't think there's any correlation.

&gt;As for NI the majority were and are unionists, it's hard to dispute though that we would be worse off just letting them kill each other. 

What about helping one side kill the other to lengthen the war, which was apparently part of the strategy of the Glenanne gang I linked you to earlier? part of what they were doing was fomenting a sectarian murder campaign precisely to derail the peace talks between the British government and the IRA in 1975 or so.

true,smokey815,num11,,"Ah, the post match Lamela appreciation thread.  Perfect.

I think that we were pretty good on the whole.  We concede a goal, but I'm not going to put that too much on anyone.  It was a good finish off a save.  We had a couple shaky moment in defense, but nothing too terrifying.

On the attacking side, Lamela was obviously brilliant, and Mousa and SIg looked solid as well.  Capoue was great driving forward at opportune moments as well.  Obvious complaints about Defoe, but I've come to expect very little from him when it comes to adding to the build up.  Good for him breaking the record though, I couldn't see anyone else taking the pen once Erik won it.

Eriksen though, looked out of it a lot of the time.  He had a couple moments that showed his class, but he wasn't quite the creative force we need him to be.",0,1383862139,null,0,false,0,cd95mg4,t3_1q4rsv,t1_cd95mg4,t3_1q4rsv,null,1428750218,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2
