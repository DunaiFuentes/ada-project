Why are the Tories trying to ostensibly appeal to 'hardworking people'? It's pretty simple - everyone likes to think of themselves as hardworking and virtuous while everyone else is lazy and underperforming. It makes people feel like they are being personally complimented as one of the besieged few people who still work hard. 

Of course everyone thinks that it applies to them specifically and excludes others. Who those 'others' might be can then be filled in with your preferred hated group - immigrants? Benefit claimants? Young people? Pensioners? It doesn't matter which.

And that's the key to it - the phrase 'hardworking people' is meant to include *you* and exclude people who you already don't like.

Evidence to suggest that helmets do much to protect cyclists is inconclusive http://www.eco-logica.co.uk/pdf/wtpp18.3.pdf, more cyclists die of injuries to the chest and abdomen so you may as well legislate for body armour as well if you want to go down that path. Mandatory helmet laws also damage the rate of cycling which is far more damaging to public health. It's about equivalent to mandating that all motorists wear a five point harness.

Reflective clothing is better for visibility in low light conditions not hi-vis and in daylight contrasting colours such as black and white are far more effective.

http://road.cc/content/news/95353-study-says-cyclists-should-make-themselves-seen-reflective-clothing-not-hi-vis

It is already law to have lights on in low visibility conditions. Doesn't seem to make much difference though, I wear a bright red jacket with reflective panels and a 500 lumen light and I still get drivers pulling out in front of me all over the shop.

Motorists are also the party at fault in most collisions with bicycles.

Apologies for any modes of transport I've missed out. I'd like, in an accident involving someone in a more vulnerable group with someone in a less vulnerable group(i.e. the one most likely to have been hurt), that the one who is least vulnerable should be assumed to be at fault in any following investigation.

Maybe the law already reflects this, but it certainly doesn't feel like this when I read about cases such as the one you highlight.

Obviously there's the ""How is cycling/pedestrian infrastructure going to be improved?"" type questions. I would like local councils to be encouraged to provide more thought-out links for connecting different parts of cities together.

First off that is utter bullshit, as someone who has fallen off a bike many times I can tell you that wearing a helmet has probably saved my life more than once. Also, that link you posted didn't mention anything about helmets lacking protection. When your head is sliding along the road you will always wish that you had bought a better helmet - wearing one might be the difference between life or death. It's not a question of which is more common but rather which is more serious - hitting your head is far more dangerous than winding yourself. 

In which case use both - I don't know about you but whenever I'm out in the car I'm looking for anyone in high vis and recognise them as a vulnerable road user. The benefit of high vis clothing is that it is also reflective and therefore can be used during the day and night.

&gt; It is already law to have lights on in low visibility conditions

Have you noticed how all modern cars now use daytime running lights? It should be the same for vulnerable road users - everyone's definition of poor visibility is totally different and therefore some people would decide not to use lights and put themselves in danger. Using lights all the time enhances the ability to be seen by pedestrians and other road users.

true,Tim_Buk2,null,null,"&gt; The Dutch did it, starting only in the fifties iirc. It's not that hard - minor, narrow streets don't need much changing. Rural roads like this one could maybe do with lower speed limits.

The Dutch model is to separate the cars and bikes. Car speed limits do not need lowering. Nowhere in the Netherlands are bikes allowed on a road with a speed limit of 43 mph (70kph) or more. 

Contrast that with UK where cyclists are allowed on 70 mph (113 kph) dual carriageways.

And between 37 mph (60 kph) and 43 mph (70 kph) it is extremely rare to mix bikes and cars in NL. I don't know of a single instance. (I cycled 22 miles (35 km) yesterday).

Solution: [separate bike paths!](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=leiden+holland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.17686,4.538858&amp;spn=0.00042,0.001032&amp;hnear=Leiden,+Zuid-Holland,+The+Netherlands&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=h&amp;z=21) Not difficult but not cheap.

your talking about stamping - im talking about number plates.

Sure - damage is done to the road which allows the potholes to fill with water - the following frost makes them worse. Ask yourself what originally caused the pothole to start.

If you're self employed, or potentially petit-bourgousie, then perhaps.  For the vast majority; who work for an employer, working _removes_ control and independence.

You have to be where they say, when they say.

How does that given one 'control' or 'independence'?

If you want to draw a parallel between being on benefits, and being in work, then all one is achieving is trading a dependance on the State for a dependance on an employer - hardly a gain in 'independence'.

The lions share of benefits goes to landlords in the form of housing benefit.  ESA is £70/week - THAT is what you get to live on.

My concern, and a concern of many more learned people than me in the subject, is that 'careless driving' is a *vague* law - poorly defined. That is absolutely a reasonable criticism to raise.

&gt;Broad and unsupportable. I'd ask you for evidence but such a bold statement is impossible to support without falling back to anecdotes (and your existing anecdote certainly doesn't fall into that category anyway).  

OK, valid point, I thought about adding citations while writing that comment but I was pressed for time. Have a look at some recent statistics:

- September 27th, 2013: [The number of people killed in drink-drive crashes rose by 17 per cent to 280 last year. The number of cyclists killed on the roads rose by 10 per cent to 118. The number of children killed on their bikes more than doubled to 13. Department for Transport (DfT) statistics showed that cycling had become more dangerous in each of the past four years, undermining Government claims that it was becoming safer to cycle as more people take to two wheels.](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3880188.ece)

- September 28th, 2013: [The criminal justice system in England and Wales appears to have become more lenient towards motorists over the past decade, while simultaneously handing down harsher sentences for other crimes, initial research by a statistics and traffic psychology expert has found.](http://road.cc/content/news/95163-crimes-have-become-more-likely-attract-custodial-sentence-last-decade-unless-they)

Now those aren't anecdotal reports, they are based on official DfT figures and academic research. The roads are getting more dangerous.

You may wish to argue that that isn't relevant in this case, but maybe I just worded the original post badly: the crux of the argument I intend to make to Baker is that the roads are getting more dangerous, that concerns me, and I want to see stricter sentencing and liability in at-fault accidents. I [could](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/aug/08/nottingham-police-cyclist-video) supply [many anecdotes](http://www.roadjustice.org.uk/case-study/anthony-hilson-46-killed-cycling-a4-driver-convicted-causing-death-careless-driving-16912) to explain my view that the sentencing regime is too lax, but you're right that anecdotes shouldn't inform policy. I just happen to believe that a wider trend is absolutely being displayed through each individual case.

This isn't about bicycles (and not, say, pedestrians or horse-riders or innocent drivers who get struck). This is about making sure that those who have caused death are not allowed to start driving again in five years - [even when it's happened twice](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-24240127).

The other portion of your argument I'm not sure I follow. Are you suggesting that whether the driver overtook on a blind bend or on a perfectly straight road is irrelevant? Such a manoeuvre should never exceed the visibility available to the driver.  
I believe we may be fundamentally misunderstanding one aspect - you think the car got safely back into her own lane in time and the cyclist fell off of her own accord into her path, like someone falling off a platform and in front of a train, whereas I think the car crossed the central dividing line and passed the rider on the wrong side of the road - either striking her directly, or cutting past so close that she caused the fall.

As a motorist myself, I find it tough to believe that you're calling that 'bad luck' on this driver's part.

What? more cyclists are dying from wounds to the chest and abdomen than head injuries.

Reflective and hi-vis clothing aren't the same thing as the link I gave showed. Hi-vis is less effective in low light that than reflectives and less effective in the day than just wearing contrasting colours.

Yes there are cheaper properties about - I was paying £500 a month for a four bed house a couple of years ago, but that's 200 miles north of the City in a town with shit-all prospects and high unemployment.  So they move up north, and have even less prospect of getting a job than in London and are now a £100 train ride or £60 drive from family.

*If* that £500 was going straight into the families pocket it would be a different story, but it's money they don't see and have no control over.

Breakfast:
Leaf Cafe on Bold Street - Fantastic little place. Great breakfast/lunch items. They actually have a pescaterian english breakfast that's brilliant and the baked goods are super fresh and all made from scratch. So good I think I ate there every morning.

Dinner:
Lunya on College Lane - Good bustling atmosphere. Decent sized portions for the tapas and they had the best olives that I've ever had in my life. Not kidding. I very large dinner for two came to about 80-88 pounds or so but that's with a nice bottle of wine as well.

Spire: One of the best but you should call and make a reservation as early as you can as they're booked up all the time.

Drinks/Nightlife:

Modo: Was decent with a lot of people. Service was quick when I was there. Can drink outside or inside. An army of security guards which is was needed as there's a lot of testosterone being thrown around at night around Fleet Street.

Philharmonic Pub: Always good to have a drink at the ust for the history of the place. Yeah, everyone goes for the toilets. Nice and all but just stuck like shit. Plus it never fails how a group of women always ask to come in and take a look while I'm taking a piss. 

Slater's:
Super young crowd. Shithole, but might as well have a 'Quad Vod'. Plus for like 3-4 pounds, why not?

Bierkeller: Decent place in Liverpool One. I think Carragher is a part owner. Loads of sing songs in the back. Nice atmosphere for a boozy weekend afternoon.

Just a few things. There's more, but need to get back to work. Have fun.

true,CageChicane,lfc12,,"Its completely dependent on the formation. 3-5-2 is playing to our strengths, but makes Lucas marginalized. 4-2-3-1 means two CBs are on the pine which is tough when selecting between the VC and one that cost 17 mil. I think we will play in both formations depending on what the other team is trying to do or if we are on the road. This is a big difference from last season when we basically rolled out the same lineup with the same tactics for 5 straight months.

Its almost easier to just break down a few positions instead of the entire lineup:

Suarez and Sturridge pick themselves and are best suited for a ST tandem regardless if that is 3-5-2 or 4-1-2-1-2.

Coutinho picks himself, but I would like to see Allen get time at CAM late in games when wee #10 gets tired.

Henderson/Gerrard/Lucas should be on a rotation for different reasons.

Sakho &gt; Agger. He is just dominant and appears to settle in better by the minute.

Toure &gt; Skrtel. Likely 60/40 on playing time just due to age. Kolo seems to hurt himself often.

Glen is the most obvious selection of them all. Enrique is better defensively, but Cissokho is likely to more useful going forward. I think we will see them used 50/50 with Enrique favored against tougher opposition. Jose also likes to pull his hamstring about once a year.

GK: Migs

CBs: Toure, Skrtel/Sakho, and Agger

RWB/LWB: Johnson &amp; Enrique

LCM/RCM: Lucas &amp; Gerrard

CAM: Coutinho

STL/STR: Suarez &amp; Sturridge

The use of 3 defenders allows for Johnson and Enrique to work higher up the flanks and would work well considering they have a fairly attack minded personality. This would also allow for Gerrard and Lucas to be used further up the pitch, rather than having to track back in order to provide defensive cover, keeping the both of them fresh if they are to play the full 90 minutes. Coutinho behind of Suarez/Sturridge is a no-brainer, allow him to drift into space, receive the ball to his feet, and work his magic. Suarez and Sturridge is quite possibly the most devastating strike partnership that LFC has had in years.

&gt; “Fir Park should have been torched on Thursday in order to cleanse the stadium after it played host to black footballers.”    

Fake quote.    

&gt; It’s a pretty shocking statement but this is how the sentence reads after I have done my usual misogyny/homophobia test and replaced the word ‘women’ or ‘gay’ for the word ‘black’.     

So hold on, what exactly was the original quote? That leaves us two options:   

 - ""after it played host to gay footballers""    
 - ""after it played host to women footballers""      

Which was it!    

&gt; These words were written by the radio pundit Tam Cowan    

Uhh you cannot say ""these words"" when you forgot to post the goddamn actual words he said. Don't post a hyped up fake quote and then say ""these words were written by"" that's just dishonest and stupid.    
 
&gt; He went on: “Just the other week I bumped into a couple of women footballers (I’ve still got the bruises to prove it) and they were honestly two of the nicest blokes I’ve ever met.”

If the statistics say otherwise than so be it, but i wouldn't start Dzeko over Negredo in a game that really mattered/of significance. And not just this game but look at Dzeko and negredo in the BPL, Negredo has been the far better perfomer and the stats back this up.You have to admit that sometimes Dzeko just seems like he couldnt give 2 f*ks. I have nothing against Dzeko as a person and him doing well we only make me happy, it just really miffs me off when it seems like he would rather be at home watching the telly instead of pressing in the game

And you have to admit you have a bias for dzeko seen in your comments/threads

 ""Let's hope Dzeko scores tonight hopefully he shows his best out there and gets his form 100% back"" 

""Why is Dzeko always a second option?""

""you've watched him for 6 years you see what he is capable of and then you see his moments of brilliance again ...Just feel the need to defend him sometimes **because I am a really big fan of him** on and off the field. I've met him in real life...""  

""We played a lot better when we put in unselfish players like Silva and Milner. Anyone agree? [implying the people who came off Aguero Nasri are greedy therefore bad implying dzeko is better dzeko is god blah blah blah heard it all before] ""

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"**TL;DR**

The author Steven Maclean states:

* The Lucas/Gerrard partnership isn't really working.
* Coutinho is crucial to possession, creativity from the back, starting attacks, etc.
* The early-last-season Joe Allen performances where he sat in front and in between the centre backs were arguably some of his best performances.
* Mignolet's so-called distribution problems may be due to the fact that he's not quite confident or sure who to distribute it to.

Maclean's solution? A sort of 4-1-2-3 (or 4-3-3, if you prefer).

3: Moses - Sturridge - Suarez

2: Coutinho - Henderson

1: Joe Allen

4: Enrique - Sakho - Toure - Johnson

He does acknowledge that there's no reason to panic or anything like that (after all, we are second in the table) but he's sorta looking ahead to a post-Gerrard/Lucas world.

As for me, I tend not to post these sorts of links about ""hey, what if so-and-so plays here"" and ""hey, what if the formation was this-and-that"" but I do like to read them and I thought the author brought up some fair and well-written points (at least better written than other posts that I've seen around which doesn't really go as in-depth as I hope they would).

EDIT: By the downvotes it would appear that this is not a popular opinion. I didn't realise that my fellow Brits had such trust in the system. As it stands as from my point of view its fucking terrible. We perpetuate the awfulness through keeping the two-party system. I.E. when you vote 1st or 2nd party you're _barely_ changing anything but just swapping the face of the person who fucks us. Vote 3rd party and get these vested interests out of politics, get the parties to look at themselves and re-evaluate the way they act. If there are multiple viable parties it also becomes increasingly expensive to lobby which is great for us citizens. At the moment its just a 50-50 bet.

If your landlord took a deposit, has not given you it back at the end of the tenancy and the deposit was not protected, you will have to take them to county court to recover the amount. You will need a soliciter for this and it will be expensive - there is no *guarantee* you will win and that you will be able to recover these costs from the landlord though from what you have stated it sounds as if, at the very least, the judge would order that the deposit be repaid and that the landlord should be liable for costs.

The amount you receive will be at the judges discretion, this will vary from nothing but the deposit to the deposit and 3x the amount of said deposit. It is extremely unlikely to receive 3x the amount, in my experience it is unlikely you will receive anything at all in terms of compensation if the landlord is agreeable to giving you the deposit back when asked to do so.

Whilst the independence of POPLA has been brought into question, successful appeal strategies have been identified. If your appeal is allowed, then by the BPA Ltd’s Code of Practice, the parking company must cancel the ticket. One should bear in mind that POPLA is only available in England and Wales, so this strategy would not be applicable for tickets issued in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

true,27percent,null,null,"I totally understand your point, but we're not massively happy with charging a fee either. We're working on a couple of ways to completely eliminate it so it's free or, ideally, earns interest for users.

I'll address your concerns more thoroughly one by one:

1. We are Dripfeed - A UK registered limited company, we're partnered with Barclays, we're aggressively pursuing FCA regulation to secure funds if the worst happens since we already adhere to their protocols, and we  move money through GoCardless, who themselves are FCA regulated, backed by a number of top-flight investors and are trusted by thousands of UK companies to do Direct Debits on their behalf.

2. You can click the 'Withdraw' button on your dripfeed and it'll automatically move the money you've saved so far to your bank account. We tried to make this as simple as possible so people don't get stuck when they need their money.

3. No, we wont, we flag the dripfeed as withdrawn, de-authorize direct debit access, and never charge for it again.

4. We direct debit through an impartial third-party, GoCardless, who're trusted by thousands of UK companies to direct debit on their behalf. We never actually see your bank account info so it's impossible for us to direct debit from your account without you letting us.

5. Good question - Savings accounts pay almost-zero in interest on small, short-term savings. Because of that, I started putting £2 a day into a piggybank to save up for a new phone, but I don't carry cash so it was a pain. So I ended up building a digital piggybank to digitally put £2 a day into, which scratched my initial itch. We're also interested in working your money in ways that a typical bank simply isn't interested in.

Re: fees - Yes, the fees *suck*, but we're working on that. We're negotiating a way to leverage savings to create enough interest to drop the charges, and we're also rolling out a feature in a week or two to find cheaper deals for the thing you're saving for (since we know what you're saving for, and roughly how long it'll take to save for it, we can ask multiple suppliers if they'd be willing to cut a deal for the money sooner). These're just a couple of ideas we're rolling out to get rid of the fees. Again, I don't think I can make myself clear enough when I say we really want to stop charging a fee, but we have to keep the servers running in the meantime so people can use the service :)",0,1380819269,null,0,false,0,cckb5pt,t3_1nnpuk,t1_cckb5pt,t1_ccka328,null,1429258030,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Since I am not defending the government, and have no intention of defending the government, I feel slightly entitled to use the words ""personal responsibility"". Remember, this does not mean I am defending the government. I am merely trying to get you to acknowledge two things:

- When people buy drugs, they are making a personal choice.
- Buying illegal drugs can lead to bad consequences. 

Reminder: I'm still not defending the government! Frankly, I agree with you that having legal, controlled drugs might lessen some of the bad consequences I mentioned above. But, crucially, *I have no control over government policy*. Drugs happen to be illegal where I live - this is not up for discussion. Therefore, were I to choose to buy these illegal drugs, some of those bad consequences might happen. Similarly, if you live in a place where drugs are illegal, choosing to buy those drugs might also lead to bad consequences.

Leaving them both out and playing Allen as a lone deep midfielder with Coutinho part of a 2 ahead of him, that's pushing it. For a start, he criticises Lucas for getting drawn to the ball when this is a much bigger weakness of Allen's. He comes up with this idea of playing Coutinho as a central rather than attacking mid based on the positions he was taking up at swansea while ingoring how poor we played in that game even when Coutinho was on the pitch.

The midfield hasn't been absent all season. It was very much there against stoke and the first half at villa. It was pretty good in the midweek match against man united (for the record, in that game lucas pressed, won the ball high up the pitch through good reading of the game and played a good throughball to sturridge).

The midfield could be improved by two things: a high defensive line as against stoke to reduce the space they have to cover, and forwards dropping deep to provide passing options as at Man United.

This is a fair point. Note however that a link between personal income and reduced working hours is also raised.

&gt;Is it really the hours worked here that is the issue? I don't think that working less is going to solve the Greek GDP issues. It's a far too simplistic way of looking at things. 

Saying that there is not a positive correlation does not mean that the number of hours worked is causally related negatively to GDP.

Asda is probably the cheapest full supermarket, but if you're flexible with what you want, I often find Sainsbury's is genuinely cheaper if you're happy to take advantage of what's on offer in a given week. Asda's everyday prices tend to be slightly lower, but stuff on multisave deals at Sainsbury's can end up making the overall shop cheaper.

Aldi is overall slightly cheaper than the usual supermarkets, but you'll likely find you can't get certain things there that you want, and might end up doing a separate trip to somewhere else anyway, invalidating the small cost saving. If you find you can get everything there, it may well be the best.

Lidl is cheap, but the range they stock is unpredictable. It's great to go there, pick up the stuff that's cheap plus any of the weird specialty stuff they have that you like, and then do the rest of your shopping across the road at Asda.

Aguero wants the ball in and around the box area, once he gets in that range you know he's looking to score and not to pass which makes it a waste of both positions. It would be much more effective if he played further up and a proper midfielder gave the ball to him so he would have less to do rather than try and take one 2 or 3 defenders from further back like he is right now. He is more creative and can do more with the ball than Dzeko and he is a better finisher. Negredo is of a similar make which why he is a good back up. 

This is the line up they should be playing:

GK- Hart
RB- Zabaleta
RCB- Kompany 
LCB- Nastasic
LB- Clichy/Kolarov 
RDM- Toure
LDM- Fernandinho

Current activities of corporations and governments suggest that they are aware change is coming and desperately want to maintain the status quo. These last desperate grasps for power could still succeed, keeping our species artificially tied to methods of control that are no longer required. 

For the some, science, innovation, and progress have become more trouble than they are worth. For many, winning is worth nothing unless someone else loses and the only real power is power over their peers. For the first time in history the elite face the possibility of equal access to matter, energy, and data and it scares them on a level they are quite unfamiliar with.

Most of the team picks itself really, choosing the centre back pairing is the tough part so I picked it on current form. Toure has been fantastic since arriving so I'd keep him in the team, Sakho has looked solid enough since arriving, if a little too eager to jump into a challenge, but looks calm and comfortable on the ball most of the time, Skrtel got a chance against Utd and jumped at it, he's impressed since and is making it difficult to drop him, being in the middle of 3 centre backs seems to suit him too.

Agger is the glaring omission, but I honestly don't know what to do with him. I think the plan was for him and Sakho to partner each other, but no one expected Toure to do as well as he has done, and most people thought Skrtel was on his way. I think the benefit of having 4 good centre backs is that it will spur them on to keep their place in the team, once Agger gets back into the team again he'll need to perform as there is serious competition for his place.",0,1380822248,null,0,false,0,cckcbr0,t3_1nnkvw,t1_cckcbr0,t3_1nnkvw,null,1429257488,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Both parties are the same in that they don't have the interest of the electorate at heart. Both are childish and capable of acting like cunts. Also both are very similar since the rise of New Labour. Old Labour was a very different beast but barely exists anymore.

Read the Hansard, that shit is way better than the news! There is the odd MP that is worthy of respect but typically these people are not allowed to rise in rank and remain in the back-benches.

Because of the stupid two party system its impossible for an MP to maintain their dignity AND get into a position of ""serious"" power (cabinet/shadow cabinet). If you want to play at the big-boy table you have to cash in to the whip. The price? Your principles.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; The offending article was hastily changed when the paper realised how badly out of step with the national mood it was, but just for a moment the mask slipped and the ugly truth was there for all to see. Although the hard rightists of the Daily Mail love to wrap themselves in the Union Jack when it suits them, they frankly despise this country and what it has become. It is they, not their opponents on the left, who really hate Britain.

There are probably lots of people who write for the two Mail titles who would be classified as social conservatives and oppose all of the things that the Olympic opening ceremony alluded to. But the Mail, like all papers, exists for profit. And amongst the major papers the [Mail has the second highest circulation, only beaten by the Sun](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/uk-national-newspaper-sales-relatively-strong-performances-sun-and-mirror). 

To say that the Mail defends the consensus in Britain would be untrue, but is it really so long since [Lord Ashcroft's poll on immigration showed a majority sceptical about it](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/article1308078.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2013_09_01)? Even as Gay Marriage stormed through the commons, a good 20% of people opposed the right of gay people to marry, as shown in [YouGov](http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/2chabiz0nj/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-100513.pdf) and [Ipsos](http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=12795) polls in the Summer.

Partly it's an age thing, but conservative Brits are actually a lot more common than people like to think, and the Mail panders to them because it sells them papers, not merely out of agenda. That these views are so prevalent might be attributable in part to the Mail, but too much ire is focused on the paper and not those who read it.

Talking about his ""responsibility"" is a way to detract and distract from the fact that it's the government's fault he couldn't get a clean hit.

/u/Llanita (formerly /u/Salvaxe) is well-known in this subreddit as an authoritarian troll.

Notice how she ignored the question *""Should our laws really infringe on peoples liberty, just because you don't like how they choose to enjoy themselves?""* and has made no more contributions to this thread? 

This is typical behaviour for /u/Llanita, ducking questions and running away - not bad tactics if you view discussion as fundamentally antagonistic, as she does.

The victim's family is probably already plenty conflicted about this matter, and are surely already saying ""the stupid sod"" at the same time as they're crying ""oh god, I miss him"".

I think the one that gets bandied about most is that Gerrard is a legend and its hard to phase out legends (to a lesser degree Lucas has established himself as a ""worker"" and therefore is a fan and coach favorite, despite having his weaknesses). 

But the real issue isn't that the Gerrard/Lucas partnership has its weaknesses, but that any other combination of our current CM capable players has proven woeful. 

Anyone remember our Hendo and Allen pairings last season? We were atrocious and I don't believe that's because Allen had a knock and Hendo wasn't yet improved. It was each player's known weaknesses being exposed due to the requirements of the position and the strengths of the partner. 

We aren't in this situation like Chelsea and Utd. They can phase out their legends because inarguably there were players who could do the job as well or better. Not to mention that none of those players (Giggs, Scholes, Neville, Lampard, Terry...), despite the regard the fans and footballing world held for them, were ever what Gerrard was to Liverpool. He has been our team, unequivocally, for over a decade. Our successes have come almost entirely from him. So its not just a matter of finding another winger to replace Giggs. Or another goal scorer from midfield to replace Lampard. Its putting the heart and soul of your team on the bench.

Until someone else can take on that role, we're going to be pushing Gerrard until he can physically not play. 


BUT the end of here is that until we have a combination in the middle that can see through games confidently, without Gerrard and Lucas, we can't really blame Rodgers for sticking with them. While some (me amongst them) have argued Gerrard's weaknesses wouldn't be so relevant if he were partnered with a more physically gifted partner, I think its makes more sense to have someone who can come on for Gerrard than it does to buy someone to replace Lucas in the first 11.


Although certainly we need a better option at DM off the bench. This Crystal Palace match might just illuminate what a shocking amount of fans (and Rodgers) were ignoring in their bid to sign a ""marquee"" player this summer.

true,Limes19,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Talking about his ""responsibility"" is a way to detract and distract from the fact that it's the government's fault he couldn't get a clean hit.

So what? It may very well be the government's ""fault"" that he couldn't get a clean hit. *He still chose to take it.*

&gt; /u/Llanita (formerly /u/Salvaxe) is well-known in this subreddit as an authoritarian troll.

Er, so? Why are you deflecting this onto other people? You and I are having this discussion. Llanita is entitled to his or her own opinion.

&gt; It wouldn't be ""their responsibility"" if we didn't have stupid drugs laws - stop blaming them.

But we **do** have these laws! People do not operate under ideals of what they would *like* the laws to be, they operate under what the laws *actually are*.

&gt; The victim's family is probably already plenty conflicted about this matter, and are surely already saying ""the stupid sod"" at the same time as they're crying ""oh god, I miss him"".

Meaningless appeals to emotion. I'm not speaking to the victim's family, I'm speaking to *you*.

&gt; Please don't go talking about ""personal responsibility"" when someone has died as a result of these idiotic drug policies.

And, again, you are ignoring my point. The man has died because of the result of choices *he* made. He knew what the laws are, and he went ahead with the drugs anyway. Yes, in an idealised society where you can buy heroin at boots, he might not have done. But that is not the society we live in, and you appear unable to accept that. If you want to go to the government and campaign for drug legalisation, then I won't have a problem with you.

Labour's policies are rarely that socialist anymore..... I mean... as a brief example why not re-nationalise the trains?

You can reference my other comments but you chose to disregard the statistics I post in them and stick with your repetitive ""Negredo is better"" ""he works harder"" and frankly it's a load of bull if he doesn't perform statistically better.

I'd rather show them that we can tolerate their misguided blathering and turn the other cheek. We are better than them. I don't need their apology and I value free speech and the freedom of the press too highly to try and force them to apologise.

The more work you do yourself, the cheaper it will be.  I'm not saying that you have to do anything clever, but can you organise kitchen fitters, electricians, tilers and painters yourself?

If so, then plan what you want.  Go to Howdens and plan out how you want your kitchen to look.  Then go to mybuilder.com and get some quotes to rip out the older kitchen and put the new kitchen.  

Get them to rip out the old kitchen first, then leave it for a couple of days.  Then have the electricians come in and add the new plug sockets, run the power to the electric oven, extract fan, under cupboard lights, and so on.  Then have a painter come in to paint it, then have the kitchen fitters back in to fit the new kitchen.  It can be a full time job to organize, but it will save you £10k.

Also buy your sinks, taps, etc on amazon/ebay.  A £400 tap from a kitchen shop will cost you £20 on amazon.  A £2000 extractor fan costs £200 on amazon.

The more work you put into planning this, the more you will save.  Big time.

I personally even chipped off the old tiles, to save having to pay someone to do it for me.

Btw, for splashbacks, have a look at buying them online too.  I bought from [here](http://www.shepwayglass.co.uk/splashbacks/printed-digital-glass-splashbacks.aspx) - a glass splashback with a custom digital photo backing.  I got a photo with a picture of Mount Fuji, and it looks gorgeous.  And again, much much cheaper than a splashback from kitchen shop.

---

Disclaimer - if you do chose to manage the different workers yourself, you will also have to watch them like a hawk, since you're the only one with the overall plan in your head.  Will the washing machine taps be physically accessible once all the cupboards are in?  Will there be a plug socket accessible for the fridge?  There will be lots of little things that will go wrong, and you're going to have to be able to live with the little imperfections.

You cannot penalise the majority in favour of the minority. 


EDIT: Would someone like to come up with some reasonable reasons why I might be wrong instead of simply downvoting? The anti-car sentiment on this sub is almost insufferable.

As to the health of it? YMMV.  But ultimately I had some good quality rice noodles (not a bad starch) in a brilliant broth, with a bunch of basil, mint and a load of beansprouts.  These are more about tasty than anything particularly healthy, but they aren't unhealthy.  The beef, good cuts and I swear regulars get a few bits more.  Yes, it's Ramen if a fresh trout is fish fingers.

The chicken was skinless, grilled with spices, on a salad of lettuce, lotus root, and a few tomatoes for visual dressing.

My point is, that for having something that is so tasty, so healthy for so little, I've not found anything else similar too.

This isn't suggesting it's the cheapest thing.  I can't believe people are comparing eating out to making food at home.  If I've got more work to do than hours I can work in the day, then I'm not going to cook myself, unless I find it pleasurable am I?  It doesn't make sense, google ""C#, WPF"" in London, it is a skill that is considered productive but short in demand, I mean people pay four figures a day for it.  So if you are doing that, why on earth would you waste time doing something that you didn't have too, that you don't enjoy.  I'd just squandered 3 hours having a cycle n workout, I couldn't really justify spending the half hour plus I'd be in the kitchen, with the constant distraction of needing to keep an eye on it.

Yes there will be cheaper meals available, there will be healthier ones, there will be cheaper ones.  But as a lifestyle London offers you that brilliant choice, at a very affordable price.

Right.....here we go....

&gt;a test

No point. 86% of cyclists of a driving age hold a driving licence. Statistically cyclists are more likely to own cars than non cyclists. 

But let's assume though that none of that is factually true....

What are your complaints about cyclists? Running red lights? Cycling on the pavement?

You don't need a driving licence to know both of those are against the HC. So if you accept that what the point of a license anyway. They will break the law regardless. Bit like 50% of drivers who regularly speed,  or 80% of drivers who have admitted to using a phone, or like the recent crack down by police on one stretch of road that found over 50% of car drivers breaking the law (everything from not road worthy, no seatbelt, phone use)

&gt;insured

Most cyclists are insured. Admittedly it's not a legal requirement (because cyclists are a fraction as dangerous and a fraction of the cost of cars). Most have insurance as part of the liability cover though their household insurance. Many like myself (road bike) have it though their cycling club. Others have it via for a small fee of around £25 from a dedicated 3rd party.

&gt;contribute money.

Did you know that there is no such thing as road tax, and roads are primarily paid for though council tax? Did you know road funding comes primarily from council finding, and is often part of pavement funding?

Now...councel tax does not pay for everything, but it's the largest contrubuter to inner city/town infrastructure which is the primary areas cyclists use.

Now, with regard to ""road tax"" - it's actually called Vehicle excise duty and it's a tax calculated on CO2. Something that cyclists don't produce in large enough amounts to justify a tax disc. Bit like Hybrids, Electric cars which also pay £0

So, you're probably now asking where your ""road tax"" goes if not directly back into the roads...it goes back into the central pot and is redistributed as the government deems fit. Some of it no doubt goes back into the road system - probably to pay for a motorway or two (something cyclists can't use anyway), or maybe its paying for speed bumps, or potholes cased by motorized vehicles. Some of it might be paying for the NHS, or the fire service there to help car drivers when they have those massive high speed crashes...who knows.

Some tips mot specifically on the industry, I'll try and keep it short and sweet.  

1. You need to really be London based as it the central hub for the music industry, also gig wise there is more going off (venues, theatres etc). I wasn't and did ok but I regret not moving there when I had the chance.  

2. Know your trade. Try and get as much hands on experience with as many digital desks and gear as possible, back in the day I emailed loads of the manufacturers they often have free training days you can attend. 

3. Repair skills. Make sure you can at least solder and wire up cables. Basic electronics knowledge is pretty much essential and sets apart a good ""sound guy"" from an engineer. 

4. Try and have another ""hat"" which can support you when you're starting out, for me it's IT and has seen me through many a dry spell. 

5. Once you're here try and get in with a production company or rehearsal room, making teas fixing cables, helping load in and out etc. Really good for building contacts and gaining experience.

6. UK touring crew group on Facebook is pretty active and worth checking in with. Of course like in any industry people aren't always helpful for the people looking to start out but they often forget how they started and got to where they are today.

I've been out of the music game a year now (I have my IT hat on now) as I want to settle down and start a family soon. Plus There's only so much touring your body can take. In all it's a very tricky industry to get into but not impossible. 

Source: 10+ years working in the live music industry as technician (specifically as a monitor engineer) touring internationally 
with some notable bands and artists. 

Feel free to PM me I'll try and help as best you can.

Right now Xabi is a like for like replacement of Gerrard who would cost us both a transfer fee and wages too high for any impact he could provide.

I tend to assume that any Liverpool fans who would take the time to be on this subreddit would be genuine footballing fans with real knowledge, but those who continue to suggest Xabi is any answer at all - even in the short term - are so beyond daft I can't understand it. Is it just remembrance of past glories? Mind, Xabi only really had a couple great seasons with us so even that doesn't make much sense.

Believe me, I like Xabi, but signing him is utterly stupid. Our squad has weaknesses and he doesn't help us with any of them. Even on a loan it'd be a waste. How does he help? HOW???

Honestly, I'm incapable of understanding how anyone who has watched us play over the last 14 months and who knows the type of midfielder that Xabi is could think he would help. Stop playing fucking Fifa. Watch some real football. Premier League football. And watch US. We need a DM to backup Lucas. It might help to have a player like Benayoun (""player like"" is the key phrase) to back up Coutinho because clearly Aspas doesn't belong there and Rodgers doesn't yet believe Alberto can do the job.

As for Erik, he's gone from being one of the first names on the team sheet and playing constantly to getting a run out every other Thursday in Kerplackistan. Still, today was his first truly bad performance for us.

true,igorken,lfc68,,"Fair enough. The wages may be a serious issue. And perhaps he's indeed not enough of an upgrade to warrant taking Gerrard out of the team because that's clearly the only one he could replace.

However I don't think we need a backup for Lucas, but rather an upgrade for Lucas as well.

I'm curious how BR will solve our midfield issues. I'm not sure 3 at the back is the solution against stronger opponents. I like Hendo's work rate, Allen's pressing, Lucas' tackling, Gerrard's free kicks, but I'm not convinced the solution can be found in our current squad.

true,riskoooo,eng-essex,Essicks innit,"Apologies. I have no idea where I got that you were defending him, or that you were arguing a point of view about him. You were rather diplomatic in your response to what must have seemed a rude and unwarranted post, so thanks for not reacting in a similar knee-jerk manner. The only excuse I can give is that this discussion is close to home.

Regarding Goves policies - the biggest problem is that he flat out refuses to acknowledge or negotiate with teaching unions or listen to the opinions of teachers. But you've heard all that... so:


* Performance related pay completely ignores the fact that one teacher might be given low-ability sets while another is teaching high sets and A level groups. A teacher's performance is not so easily objectified. The vast majority of teachers do not want performance related pay, just as in many professions where success only comes from a mass group effort, but rather reprimand for poor teaching and more vetted recruitment, which leads on to


* Unqualified teachers - academy status, achieved under this Tory government, allows participating schools to employ unqualified teachers to teach full time. This not only undermines the specialist nature of teachers and the time and effort spent becoming competent, but means teachers pay can easily be cut in the future with the threat of under qualified people being employed in their place. This is utterly ridiculous. Would you want an unqualified doctor dealing with you or your child? An unqualified dentist? Bus driver? Mid wife? How this has occurred I don't know, and while it doesn't apply that all unqualified teachers are incompetent, the introduction of this rule has allowed something that most parents would rally against if they realised it was their child being taught by someone who was never trained;


* Free schools - Taxpayer funded schools that are opened by parents or businesses or anyone who wants to apply. Most free school applications are by religious groups, which I know might not be a bad thing... but it is. It's a policy stolen from other countries who's free schools haven't had any visible positive effects on grades or standards, so why is it being rolled out here so quickly? Probably because it means businesses can open their own schools. Call me a cynic;


* Extended working hours - This is the clincher. Only teachers and their partners know just how hard they work. Most teachers take work home *every night* and on the weekend, and work for hours and hours during the holidays. It is a constant stream of work. My SO doesn't even take her breaks at work - she uses them to prep for her next lessons, get a few books marked or address things that need addressing. Michael Gove seems completely oblivious to how excessive the workload is, and ignores the calls from unions outlining this fact. Shorter holidays! The profession is unattractive enough as it is.


* The culture of fear - OFSTED OFSTED OFSTED. I don't know of many professions where you spend months and months preparing frantically for 2 days where 5 people take a snap shot of your institution that can make or break it. Imagine being a teacher, and being told you were being inspected tomorrow during an hour lesson, and spending 3 hours planning it, only to have the inspector leave after 20 minutes, miss all the best bits and then deem your teaching inadequate. My school were OFSTED'd recently, and I found out their inspectors were asking children leading questions in an attempt to catch teachers out. OFSTED used to be a respected regulator, but the new look OFSTED might as well turn up with canes in hand. And Gove is in full support.

true,Quebe,irish,Dublin,"They've been mostly just sucking up to EU and IMF playing teachers pet throughout the crisis, politics is really weird in Ireland because we have three major parties with long histories who have absolutely nothing distinguishable from each other as far as policy goes, like at least in Britain it's clear Labour is the left of centre and Conservatives are the Right but the main Irish parties just all do the exact same shit and don't even claim otherwise, Fianne Fail does X, Fine Gael criticise Fianne Fail for X, voters elect Fine Gael on the promise they wont do X, Fine Gael get elected and do X, Fianne Fail criticize Fine Gael for X, repeat ad nauseum.

It's been like this for decades and has no indication of changing, every one in the country hates all our politicians we have a 30% age under 35 unemployment with 16% across the board but no one is arsed to go out and protest like they do in Greece while the austerity measures pile on each year with the utopian promise of ""Ah sure just wait it out and it'll all be good again after the recession ends"", though they've been saying that since 2007 presumably consulted a prophetical Druid to be so assured it will magically end one day given they are so confident while having no actual plan.

As a good reference point to Ireland's Zeitgeist we're going to have an important referendum in a few days to abolish the Seanad which is our crude and wholly unrepublican adaptation of your House of Lords.

Well the way you put it was as if £7.50 was pretty cheap for lunch. ""Where else...""? Inviting contest really.

As for your choice of lunch, I know Vietnamese diners where you can pick up your beef noodle soup and ice coffee for less than £7.50. But I tend not to eat Vietnamese too often here, it just reminds me how much better it tastes on the streets of Hanoi.

&gt; I'm curious where in the city you can sit down, use the WiFi and such for £3.50 whilst getting half as much food as I had? I'll frequent it next time I'm there.

You're kinda moving the goal posts now, gone from buying lunch to somewhere you can sit, eat and use the internet. But it's pretty easy for me, my office has a break area with a pool table, ps3 and wifi. So I can go pick up any lunch I like and sit down there and chill out. I can pop out to any of the nearby markets and pickup something nice and go back. Nice japanese chicken katsu wrap for only £3.50. We also have a guy at lunch time who sells nice sandwiches, salads and soups in the office, so I don't even have to leave if I don't want to. Handy in winter when it's cold and wet outside.

I did a composition MA at a conservatoire and a composition BA at a university and my actual practical skill improved a lot more at the conservatoire.

I don't entirely agree with you - I think it may be possible for cars and bicycles to share some of the same roads - but IMO cycling infrastructure won't improve until we sacrifice the convenience of motorists, and there isn't the political will to do so. 

I believe there are places in Holland (which is also notably flatter than here) where cars are on a permanent diversion around 3 sides of a square, so that bicycles can ride direct. If car drivers here found themselves driving 3km instead of 1km because a road was closed in favour of cycling, there'd be an uproar.

Milton Keynes has segregated cycling, which is really great for your kid to ride a mile or two to or from school or a friends' house. Unfortunately planning priority was given to fast, straight roads for automotive traffic, so in crossing those the cycling lanes take riders slightly out of their way, and require extra effort of uphill pedalling over a bridge. 

A cyclist wants to travel as flat and as straight as possible, especially if you're wearing jeans or office clothes. I don't mind wearing lycra if I'm working out, but the necessity of carrying a bag and finding somewhere to change discourages casual cycle use.

I'm not saying Milton Keynes' segregated cycling is rubbish, but it's far more suited to travelling 1 or 2 miles than it is suited to trips of 5 or 8 miles. If you want to cycle just halfway across town, the main roads look far more appealing to a cyclist, many times of day.

In a recent thread showing the irresponsible cyclist at the level crossing, someone wondered why cyclists ""don't like stopping for traffic lights"". I'm not advocating jumping red lights, but the reason is that accelerating a bicycle from a standing start to 5mph or 10mph requires much more energy than maintaining the speed of a moving bike. 

In many threads about bicycles we see comments that ""cyclists should obey the rules, too"", but if we changed the rules, we'd find it's not just about the *rules* but about *entitlement*. Car drivers feel entitled to use the road without inconvenience because, let's face it, most of us dislike inconvenience, and also because that's the way it's always been done.

If we changed the rules of the road to require car drivers to stop at every intersection so that bicycles could barrel through them at high speed and without slowing down, well, of course there'd be uproar. That's an extreme example, but it illustrates how car drivers don't want to be inconvenienced by this cause and how cycling is a secondary consideration in road planning.

Someone posted a satellite view of cycling route a while back, showing how cyclists had to ride in a big loop - increasing their journey distance - so that they could navigate a cycleway passing over a bridge or under a dual-carriageway or something. [Here's another example.](http://www.nuttycyclist.co.uk/cycling/farcilities-sustrans-longer.htm) Why should cyclists have to ride further because motorists can't drive safely? It's because their needs aren't a priority. 

OP might enjoy [this article](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2013/06/when-going-dutch-doesnt-mean-what-you.html) which I just found, but I don't hold out any hope for him actually changing anything until fuel scarcity gets a bit more pressing.

This way we could make fun of each other, and argue about things we didn't really understand.  

I was at class when they decided to pick favorite teams, so when I got home all of the ""big names"" were taken (Man U, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham).  So I looked at the League Table and it seemed like the next best teams were either Man City, or maybe Aston Villa.  I went with Man City, mainly because of the beautiful blue uniforms.  But, also because I grew up a Chicago Cubs fan, so I felt like I could relate to the championship drought, and the fan culture. 

This all happened in early 2011, so by accident, I kind of became a ""glory hunter"". So, obviously I made fun of my roommates inferior choices relentlessly.

true,ixid,null,null,"That is an excellent response and is the sort of discussion I was after. Counter-points that follow are in the spirit of discussion.

1. Yes, this is ridiculous. I think it completely misunderstands teachers. People who are money-motivated are not people who choose teaching. Though I think some of the points you raise could be addressed such as measuring improvement given the existing academic performance and socioeconomic information about a particular pupil group performance-related pay is just fundamentally the wrong idea. A better idea would be to give higher performing teachers more freedom in how they teach so they can really explore what works. That would be a proper reward- trusting in their professional abilities.

2. I certainly see where you are coming from, however certainly from personal experience there are counter-arguments. One of the best teachers I had came directly from industrial chemistry research into teaching. Now he was clearly a well qualified individual in the topic, holding a PhD combined with research experience. In some ways he was an excellent teacher, in others utterly violated the current orthodoxy (like making pupils copy down massive quantities of notes directly from an overhead projector). He didn't hold a teaching qualification, I'm not sure if he would have passed a teaching course. Allowing entirely unqualified individuals (no teaching and no subject qualifications) to teach is indeed a disaster. Teachers need high-level, subject specific qualifications. A race to the bottom is all too likely and indeed must be guarded against.

3. This seems like a way of trying to reduce costs in the main. Religious groups are willing to put money into schools so they can spread their views. I do not know enough about this, there may be some schools where it works but in the main it seems pretty disastrous and a way of allowing schools that teach things like creationism and carry out gender segregation.

4. Don't worry, I have taught in a secondary school, I do understand what it's like. The unending workload is a real grind, even compared to jobs with nominally longer hours where the work stays at work. This is stupid political rhetoric, it's easy to persuade the public that teachers are lazy because all they are aware of is school hours and most never think of lesson prep and marking as well as taking detention, after-school activities, school trips, curriculum planning etc etc etc.

5. I've not been through a recent OFSTED, went through three some years ago. Schools do need some form of inspection, no system is perfect (referring to the OFSTED) but what is a sensible alternative?

My disagreement with teachers is the bile in the rhetoric and the constant threat of industrial action. The industrial action is unprofessional and mainly alienates parents and harms children. It does little to politicians. 

An aspect of this debate that I am skeptical of is the value of 'educational research'. It is mostly low-grade sociological work, dressed up in the clothes of science and heavily laden with ideology and preconceptions. As a concept educational research is very important, what moderate amount I studied seemed very focussed on trendy and somewhat discredited nonsense like learning styles.

And, as I did say, there is fundamental value to grammar. People seem to throw their arms up in horror about it for no good reason.",0,1380838742,null,0,1380839018,0,cckisoe,t3_1nnaay,t1_cckisoe,t1_cckhyvz,null,1429254396,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Robware,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire East,"I can't really attest to being driven out of towns in favour of shopping centres due to parking spaces and charging. My experience of centres is that parking is a pretty similar ordeal to towns. But that may be the case where you live.

It doesn't have to be bikes. Just look at the hugely successful Park and Ride schemes. They're far more economical and convenient than trying to find a parking space within a town centre and they involve a bus.

I can give you comfort, but I can't give you speed and practicality for cars in urban centres. I have both cycled and driven to the same locations within town and each time the bike has been quicker than cars and far more practical given I didn't have to think about where to park or how much it cost. I also can ride my bike right up to where I need to be, which can't be said about a car in most situations.

The only time it's been worthwhile to drive in to a town or city centre is a social situation when there was a full car and it would have collectively cost more to get a bus.

I don't believe that it would be a penalisation to anyone to remove personal motor vehicle traffic from urban centres.

Perhaps I phrased my car-going-through-red question/statement a little wrong. I meant to point out how often and vocally it is mentioned in the press about cyclists doing things they shouldn't. The number of cyclists, compared to the number of motorists, is I think rather small (at any one time and ignoring the overlap). If we assume the same rate of rule infraction (is the rate of arseholes constant throughout all walks of life? discuss) then there are far more motorists breaking rules than cyclists, but there appears to be a level of anger towards those on two wheels that simply isn't merited. When a cyclist breaks the rules then I think it's fair to say that they put themselves in danger the vast majority of the time.

&gt; I'm not sure I see why it's so difficult to hold everyone accountable for their actions - not just motorists. That's something the UK continues to get wrong.

To illustrate further, with regard to the disparity I mentioned and again described above, I think people like Elanthius might say there's no danger (wrongly, of course) with a cyclist ignoring certain road rules because it's a minority of riders (the same as it's a minority of motorists) who break the rules and they are putting themselves at risk far more than anyone else i.e. pedestrian. That doesn't make it right, of course.

But with the situation we have at the minute, the pendulum is swung far too far in the 'wrong' direction: that is to say if we were to approach the middle ground of ""For feck's sake, can't everyone behave proper?"" then I think many people would prefer it to start from the reality that motorists are far more dangerous, and numerous in their rule breaking, than cyclists. One would have thought the emphasis should be on those more likely to kill.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Also, it should be LAW that anyone cycling on a road has to wear a helmet. I mean you have to wear a seatbelt in a car, and a crash helmet on a motorbike.

Won't happen. And here's why...


Cycle helmet issues get raised every once in a while in parliament, it's always dismissed once people look into the benefits/dangers of imposing them.

For example - it's been proven that helmet compulsion actualy lowers cycling numbers - not simply because of the vanity, but because of the image it sends. It effectively turns a trip down the the shops (for example) into an action that involves kitting up with safty gear. And ultimately it's to protect you from the actions of others who have introduced a car Into a public space.

In places like Australia the figures dropped by 30%, and have (apparently) still not recovered. This resulted on 2 major problems....the benefits of cycling (health benifit, cost) was lost to 1000s of once where cyclists. And the other factor was because of the drop in numbers cyclists lost the ""safty in numbers"" element unfortunatly resulted in more cyclists killed.

And less cyclists mean more cars,  which is again no good for anyone esp cyclists.

In the end the cycling population dropped, the health benefits where lost to many and deaths stayed the same.

Other reasons....

Most deaths are not the fault of the cyclist. Most deaths are due to massive head and body injuries, something a helmet would offer no protection against. 

Helmet talk in general is the worst thing for cycling safty as it devalues and ignores the real reasons cyclists get killed.

Instead, they went from defending an attack to on the counter while the referee ignored two clear fouls. Correct me if I saw that wrong though.

If your circumstances are exactly right then you could well be entitled to that amount.  However two things to consider when looking at that £34,000 and salivating:

1.  You won't see anything near that much of it.  That figure includes housing and council tax benefits, these are usually paid directly to the Landlord and council respectively.

2. I did say exactly the right circumstances.  It is unlikely you have them or would wish to jump through the necessary hoops to have them.  Despite what you read in the papers those on benefits don't all get this 'shockingly' large sums of money; the sole benefit I'm entitled to is JSA for example, or in the parlance you're using... a salary of £2,500p/a.  Distinctly less impressive than £34k eh?

I'd also point out that if you quit work you won't be entitled to a lot of benefits and you may in fact have a fight on your hand if you engineer your dismissal as well.  

Going off on a tangent, we decry the minority who go from cradle to grave on the benefits system yet the system is setup to not only facilitate such things but in its own twisted way promotes such activity.   If you approach the benefits system young enough it can be quite friendly with lots of advice about what you are entitled to; adults landing in the societal safety net usually get far more ball ache from the DWP.

Keep a months rent from your landlord? So just don't pay any rent at all for a month while you pocket that money for moving costs?

&gt;if you moved to some places in the world you can buy a house with that much money

Yep, let's all move to Afghanistan or Liberia with the huge bounty of one months London rent and buy houses!

Only if you are affected by the 'bedroom tax', and only if your council has any money left in the Discretionary Housing Payment fund, and if you are disabled with adapted accomodation or a carer, and then of course if you can actually find a smaller/cheaper place to live.

Have you actually ever had to move house on a low/non existent budget?

I actually did move from London (furnished bedsit) to a cheaper place - Northumberland, to a small 1 bed flat after I had to leave my job due to health reasons.

I received fuck all help from the govt, had to sell most of my possessions to fund my move and spent the 1st 3 months with no cooker, fridge or carpet.

If you have a problem with people in places like London costing a fortune in benefits - your anger should be directed at the ridiculous costs for rent, when [ONE tiny room](http://www.gumtree.com/p/flats-houses/self-contained-single-bedsit-available-in-edgware-ha8/113474664) in a shared house is over £100, you can't blame the unemployed.

My friend when I live in London lived in a bedsit exactly like the one above, he wanted to move but couldn't.  No way to save money, no family to help (he grew up in care), he was literally stuck  where he was.

So to top the wedding cake (no not the groom's cake ... that'll be a Tardis) he wanted a small sculpture of the Last Centurion in this pose.  He looked around on Etsy and didn't like what he saw, so he asked me.

I'm curious as to why he didn't just straight up ask me from the start.  I'm a professional sculptor who got his start customizing action figures.  So anyway, I thought this subreddit would enjoy seeing it.  The figures can come off the base so they can go on the cake, and then after the wedding I'll be able to glue them on the base so they get a nice keepsake.

I'm not decrying anybody either. I just think it's mental that we have a system which allows this to happen in the first place. How does it ever happen that the government thinks it's appropriate to start paying rent for a family on a £1200/month property? 

I appreciate that it is difficult to get started on benefits - especially when you land in the system. I keep reading these stories on reddit first hand from people here about all the crazy sanctions, unrealistic expectations and having to work for free. So I find it hard to put that against people I have known in real life who get hundreds of £ a week and put in pretty much zero effort in return. There must be people who have the right circumstances but also the ability to understand and manipulate the system.

As for the 40,000 families getting more than £500 a week. Well, it's not a massive number of people, but it's not insignificant either. I think that generally the UK has an unhealthy dependence on benefits - even working people are often relying on benefits to get by, and that's just wrong in so many ways. So if this is a first step to solving that problem, I support it. And in principle, a family living in a &gt;£1000/month property that their neighbour works hard to pay for is very wrong. It goes against the whole idea of encouraging people to work - hence my slightly facetious comment earlier about retiring onto benefits!

But we also need to solve the problem from the bottom up.

Tomorrow there will be no state pension.   No wind down, no 'in a few months' tomorrow.  Gone.

This will cut the DWP's spending by around 3/4 (yes the majority of their budget goes on the P not the D or W).  Once all of these people, who aren't working hard and thus are skivers and scroungers by the same logic applied to those unemployed are dead the NHS spending on elderly care will be cut to practically zero as will any and all subsidies paid to private care homes. 


That's my plan, feel free to double check my figures.  That is the only change needed.  And after all these threads are full of people raging about having their tax money spent on people who aren't working.... that equally applies to pensioners in my mind.

true,pow-wow,null,null,"Pasted from a [comment I made on a similar thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Liverpool/comments/1d02c7/restaurant_suggestions/c9lm6ym), here are some of my favourite places to eat in Liverpool:

VILLA ROMANA, Wood Street.
Family-run Italian restaurant. I've been eating here for years. The food matches up to (and often excels) that of the more expensive Italian restaurants in town. They have a wide range of carnivorous and vegetarian dishes on their menu. Even the pickiest eater could find something here to enjoy. They've gone all-out on the decor, complete with ostentatious murals of the typical picturesque Tuscan countryside- it's a bit tacky, but in a nice way. Very unpretentious. The waiters are all very friendly, especially that soft-spoken chap whose name escapes me. Casual dining, you don't need to dress up. I recommend the pizza.

ZORBA'S, corner of Leece St and Ranelagh St
Family-run Greek restaurant. Greek food is something that has never properly translated to Liverpool. I suspect the reason for this is that most of the Greek restaurants in Liverpool are actually run by Cypriots, whose cuisine is somewhat different (in the case of Romio's Restaurant), or perhaps that English people looking to recapture their holiday magic in Faliraki have forced Greek chefs to 'water down' their dishes into something the lowest common denominator can enjoy (in the case of the hen-night mecca that is Christakis' Restaurant).
That being said, Zorba's is your best bet for Greek food in Liverpool! There's a wide array of brilliant starters that are great for sharing. Lots of great meat and fish dishes. Vegetarian options are there too. There's great value for money here. You'll get a large portion for a reasonable prices. The decor is typical of English-Greek restaurants- lots of white stucco, pictures of beautiful islands, classical busts of philosophers. The staff are very friendly and won't look at you funny if you turn up in trainers. I recommend the spinach pie (spanakopita).

LUCHA LIBRE, Wood St
One of the most exciting places to eat at the moment. Real Mexican cuisine recreated passionately and perfectly. Their menu breaks down into 'Street Food', which is basically light lunch eating, or larger main meals. There's a great selection of starters and side dishes to go with whatever you choose. Check out the wall of hot sauces too. You can spend ages sampling the most interesting looking bottles (El Yucateco, the green one, try that). This is very casual dining- if you're comfortable with the prospect of accidentally spilling taco meat and salsa all over yourself whilst trying to impress your bird, then go here. Not for the faint-tongued. I recommend Tacos Al Pastor and the stuffed Jalapenos.

These are just three of my favourites. If you're looking for something specific then please ask. I do a lot of eating out in Liverpool so I should be able to recommend something to suit any taste.",0,1380845531,null,0,false,0,cckl5pr,t3_1norl9,t1_cckl5pr,t3_1norl9,null,1429253293,1,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,1

Mediterranean, Oriental and Asian foods.

LUNYA, College Lane.
Catalan delicatessen/restaurant. Here you can get a wide range of fresh Catalan dishes to eat in or out, cured meats, specialty products such as spices, preserves, rice, etc. They also sell some nice tableware- I got an olive serving bowl here that's really pretty. A great place to check out.

I think midfield is the big issue, attacks are going through way too quickly which leaves our defense scrambling. Joe also isn't a constant onslaught keeper, it just isn't something that happens to City often enough in recent times. Joe is a GREAT do nothing for 90 minutes and make a big save at the end keeper(unless it is a set-piece).

Tevez, I feel, is proving to be a big loss. He and Aguero were just a great tandem that held really involved the midfield. 

And Yaya... He has kind of been our best player all season but could also be a big reason to the slow start. He simply isn't pulling his defensive weight, he never really has but it is worse now because we are relying on his attacking play so he doesn't get back as much. So we leave Fernandinho, who has not impressed me yet, to defend and create the attacks. I think Yaya should be played as an attacking/central mid and put any two of Milner/Rodwell/Fernandinho in the 'defensive' midfield role.

Also, Jovetic and Aguero are a pair I'd really like to see doing more of the Tevez/Aguero thing. No complaints about Negredo yet. Dzeko though... he actually goes missing. Just clumsy... he can play great, just not always. And... how about not playing two strikers and loading up the midfield and just having one person up top? And why we've never tried a six person midfield(even with Aguero/Jovetic included in that midfield) is beyond me. Seems to me it'd make sense to match Bayern. It would perhaps disrupt their game plan, load up midfield, and allow for a little more creativity.

lib·er·ty  :Noun

    The state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life.
    An instance of this; a right or privilege, esp. a statutory one.

----------------------------------------------------------
ARTICLE 9
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or
belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship,
teaching, practice and observance.
2.
Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be
subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety,
for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the
protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
----------------------------------

Right to education
No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise
of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to
teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such
education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and
philosophical convictions.


-------------------------------------

ARTICLE 1
General prohibition of discrimination
1.
The enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured
without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
origin, association with a na-tional minority, property, birth or
other status. **E.G. Beard presence/absence**
2.
No one shall be discriminated against by any public authority
on any ground such as those mentioned in paragraph 1.

-------------------------------------
Under the Equality Act 2010, it is unlawful for any education provider, including a private or independent provider, to discriminate between pupils on grounds of disability, race, sex, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, religion or belief, or sex. Discrimination on these grounds (known as “protected characteristics”) is unlawful in relation to prospective pupils (admissions arrangements), pupils at the school including absent or temporarily excluded pupils, and former pupils who have a continuing relationship with the school.

;2. indirect discrimination occurs when treating all pupils in the same way results in putting pupils with a protected characteristic at a disadvantage. It depends on the following conditions being met:

    a provision, criterion or practice is applied equally to all relevant pupils, including those with a protected characteristic, and
    the provision, criterion or practice puts pupils sharing a protected characteristic at a disadvantage compared to other relevant pupils, and
    the provision, criterion, practice or rule puts the particular pupil concerned at a disadvantage, and
    the school cannot demonstrate that the provision, criteria or practice is justified as a “proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”.

I think we can all agree that material security for people is fundamentally desirable, though we might disagree on whether it is best delivered individually, socially or reciprocally.  I think we can also probably mostly agree that relationships of pure and/or hierarchical dependence are inimical to freedom and human well-being, as least as regards young healthy adults (the point at which adulthood is attained and those at which sickness and age relieve one of any duty to contribute are somewhat flexible).  If technology were properly leveraged, parasitism and free-riding were prevented and unproductive and positively harmful work were eliminated, the amount of work necessary to ensure such material security for the population would be drastically reduced, enabling people to have far more time for pursuing things that interested them rather than things they were forced to do simply to survive.

To expand a bit on the other good answers: taxis in the UK come in two flavours: ""hackney carriages"" which can be flagged down on the street (they usually have a ""Taxi"" light/sign on the roof which will be illuminated if available, and are often but by no means always London-style ""black cabs""), and minicabs, without a roof light but with a licensed private hire plate on the back bumper, which may not ply for hire on the street or a rank and must be booked by calling their depot. Minicabs are generally a tad cheaper, but less convenient as you have to call. To answer your question, I'd take a taxi from the rank from Gloucester Green as there's sure to be one waiting and then once you're done in Summertown, you may get lucky and spot a black cab going past, but probably easier call a minicab, assuming you have a working UK mobile by then (or ask the folks in the office you're visiting to call one for you). You'll probably have to wait for less than 5 minutes if you call one of the bigger companies (01865 778866 or 01865 240000 have served me well in the past).

Edit: Also I think you are forgetting that Kaboul has had injury problems before. Every season he misses at least a few weeks, but more like a month or two. A month in 07/08, a month in 08/09, almost 3 months in 10/11, 3 weeks in 11/12, and 8 months last season. And these injuries compound, we all know this. I'm just saying, it's not a good sign for him to be getting chronically injured. No need to downvote because I'm expressing sympathy over what could turn into the beginning of the end for Kaboul. I hope he recovers and plays for a very long time, but this shit sucks, and I'm speaking as a chronically injured ex-athlete myself.

Unless you meet certain very tightly-defined criteria then I'm afraid it is actually impossible. The following really belongs in /r/IWantOut, but hey.

These are the ways in which you could stay more than six months in the UK:

* Hold a passport belonging to one of the EU member states (other than Romania, Bulgaria or Croatia)
* Be married to a person with such a passport
* Get accepted at a university to study an undergraduate or postgraduate degree -- note that fees for international students could well be around £20,000 per year, on top of which you'll need living expenses
* Be qualified for and experienced in a job that's on the UKBA [shortage occupation list](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf) and apply for a relevant job. If accepted, the visa will almost certainly be granted.
* Be exceptionally skilled in some other field, and apply for a job in that field. Note that for non-shortage occupation jobs, the company will have to demonstrate that they have unsuccesfully tried to recruit applicants from the EU. That means that before they can offer any job to an American, they must offer it first to all 500 million citizens of the EU, many of whom are highly-skilled, fluent in English, and living in countries with high unemployment rates. Unless you genuinely think you're more talented than all those 500 million people, your chances of getting this sort of work visa are low.
* Work for a company that has offices in the UK and the USA, and get transferred to their UK offices. This route is attractive for many people as the government imposes no limit on the number of these visas issued.
* Get offered a super high-paying job in the UK. If you are accepted for any job that pays more than about £150,000 per year, the visa requirements will be waived. 
* Be super-rich. If you have £1,000,000 or more in cash that you promise to invest in the country, the government will let you in.

And that's it. Seriously. If you come over on a tourist visa and overstay, or if you even look for work while on a tourist visa, you have then become an illegal immigrant. You might get away with it for a while but you'll spend your entire time looking over your shoulder, sweating every time you see a policeman or get an unexpected knock on the door.

&gt;Keep a months rent from your landlord? So just don't pay any rent at all for a month while you pocket that money for moving costs?

why not what's the slumlord going to do? evict you? you've already moved best he can do is take it out of the deposit which is, low and behold, 1 months rent

&gt;You can't just wave a magic wand and move to a new place if you have no money and no way of getting than money.

I did, it cost £60 and a day, not to mention I had to do this around my job, where I work instead of complaining that nobody is giving me lots of money and looking after all of my problems all the time

As a follower of City, as I am a Bosnian, and a fan of Munich.. I will say this... was walking to the Celtic Pub in Sarajevo to watch the game with my friends, fans of Man Utd, and Barca.. (everyone here has a local and ""global"" team they follow) and they were all happy to see that Dzeko was starting vs Bayern. As usual, they had high hopes and hoped for a Dzeko hattrick, because he is a big deal for us, and because they love to watch me in pain.


Having followed how both teams played the beginning of this season I told them, honestly I think Munich will do the same to City, what Dortmund did last time at the Etihad stadium. I really expected Bayern to totally trash you, and I mean no disrespect to your team nor to you guys by saying this... it's just that you kinda had a shitty start of the season, except for the run vs MantUtd, another team that has done nothing but underwhelmed... while Bayern on the other hand had been adapting very well to the new system yadda yadda..


Anyhow, I told them, I hope and I believe that tonight will not be a good night for City, and I really really hope they don't play Dzeko.. because guess what, he will be blamed for everything and anything that happens on that pitch... And this is not the first time I see such reactions from this subreddit to Dzeko. I may be biased, but again, I am slightly objective when it comes to watching your games too.. and I know for a fact that there have been massive maaasssiivee slumps in performance of pretty much 70% of your teams players.. defensive issues, Silva, Nasri, even Yaya ... yes I said it, that guy can be awful as fuck on a bad day... though those days are rare.. but they don't get such circljerkish hate for it.., and guess what, on most of those days that others underperform, it's Dzeko that gets the criticism. Sure thing that clumsy fuck can under perform, I've seen it on the national side, and he can mess up some stupid straightforward situations..., it really does happen, but the immense criticism he gets is certainly undeserved, because most times when he under performs, so does the rest of your team..

I can't help but feel your comment is not meant to be helpful or constructive.

Tax for companies is complex, a friend of mine asked me what the best laptop for what he is doing would be.  After some questions it became apparent the Samsung ATIV 9 Plus was a good choice.  I get an email back *""hmm its only £1.3k, what else should I buy that costs £700""*

If you are a small company on certain VAT schemes, you can claim back the VAT on certain capital expenses that are over £2k on a single invoice.  In this case it meant that by spending another £300, HMRC will refund him £400.  Or in this case he can buy a good monitor and a tablet for £300 more.

He would never have spent the extra money, if it wasn't for the way the VAT scheme is structured.  Some people would say that is tax dodging.  Others would say it is the government encouraging people to spend more money.

This is the issue, its complex and one of perspective.  Which is why the GMG are a bunch of hypocritical douche bags, they in no way show both sides of the story, but encourage boycotts / sit-ins.",0,1380876177,null,0,false,0,ccktj4u,t3_1no07s,t1_ccktj4u,t1_ccklcvq,null,1429249317,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,HeartyBeast,cnty-uk,London,"There are a couple of problems with the internal market and splitting off services to the private sector that need to be considered. 

The first is that it introduces a huge amount of administration cost. Over  the past couple of years doctors have had to spend massive amounts of time codifying every treatment and every variant of every treatment in order to cost it; not find out out how much it costs, but to model the potential costs of each treatment, so that they can then bid on the work when it goes out to tender.

 Been a little pessimistic about how many catheters you'll need for that treatment on the  spreadsheet? Whoops - your departments just closed and its gone to a private company that has estimated 78p less per treatment. The sheer amount of work that has gone on in NHS hospitals where departments have had to bid for their own work is staggering. You have hospital consultants worrying about the contents of glossy brochures that will go out to local GPs to ensure the work comes in and they get the £x per patient per proceedure to keep a department open. I've heard doctors talking about how they could upsell- while they are in for one procedure, we could offer screening for something else to bring in more income.

That doesn't seem entirely healthy.

Second the fragmentation leads to a loss of many of the economies of scale. Because everything is individually costed, tracked and bid for with its own paperwork trail.

... and then people complain about the number of administrators in the NHS.

Yes, centralised management and monolithic operations can and do lead to inefficiencies. But oh boy, so does an internal market.

Regarding education, I've got two children in primary school, one in Year 6, so I've just been making choices as to which school she should go to. I'm lucky in that there are a number of good local authority comps where I live. They use internal setting and streaming and so cater well for all abilities.

We're going to disagree here, but I see free academies as a horrible distraction that takes away from what most people want - a *good* *local* school - a bog standard comprehensive, in fact - where the standard is high. Do I want to choose whether my daughter goes to the academy with the science, the business or the arts specialism? No  I don't. She's 10 for goodness sake. 

People compare grammar results to the local comprehensives and say 'oh look how good the results are, but seemingly ignore the fact that the 'local comprehensive' is actually a secondary modern in all but name since the grammar selects the brightest (or more likely, the most highly tutored) kids.

There's a kind of fetishistic worship of choice going on. It's bad enough at the toothpaste or shampoo shelf 'Do I have fly-away, sensitive, greasy frequent wash hair?' It's worse at school level where the majority of parents I talk to want a 'good local school' and get sick of having to make multi-dimensional spreadsheet comparisons.

The issue is when you're doing things like making null investments or sustaining loss making projects in order to cover profits with write-offs.

&gt;1. explain to me why someone losing their job should be society's problem? 

Why should reaching an arbitrary age mean you no longer have to work and live on societies pound?  It's the same question, just phrased to a hit a different demographic of benefit claimants.   We either accept that we should have these societal saftey nets for the greater good; it raises the basic standards of living in the UK a great deal for anyone unfortunate enough to need to use it  OR we scrap the whole lot and give everyone a full, complete NI refund for the whole of their work history. 

I personally would much prefer those saftey nets be increased, thus further increasing the standards of living in this country until we can honestly point to a random city in the UK and go ""Homeless?  What homeless, we fixed that one ages ago!"" 

You are free and entitled to have a vastly different opinion. 

&gt; 2.   if we accept that it is why should they not be grateful for every penny and gracefully agree to not live in the middle one of the most expensive cities in the world?

Why should they be grateful in the slightest?  We yoinked all this money from them for NI and PAYE in the name of 'the greater good' then treat them like absolute shit when circumstances dictate they use the system.   They're hounded and harassed at every opportunity and more often than not the very hoops we, as a society, insist they jump through for little more than our own sadistic amusement do more to hinder the return to work than help.

To go back to pensioners.  The reasoning ""they've paid in to the system for X years, so they've paid for this"" is often used, it intimates that for them and theirs they were not paying for the people then using the system but instead paying it in to a fund 'just for them'.   However, the unemployed are in no uncertain terms told that working people are paying for their benefits even though that very person may have been paying NI for years, if not decades.

So we either tar all benefit claimants with the same brush universally or we accept that on occasion either a pensioner OR unemployed OR disabled or even some combination of the three is going to end up living somewhere expensive and that it's just a cost of doing business as a 1st world nation. 

If we have a problem with that we should probably look at why those areas are so expensive and do something to make it more affordable rather than relocating people from perfectly serviceable properties in good condition, with excellent public transport and plenty of job opportunities for them to chase.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt;  why then do I get less money if I go unemployed than they do?

You don't.  The amount of money JSA pays out is universal for anyone claiming it.  If you are disabled, ESA pays out the same amount regardless.

These seemingly sky high payments to claimants never get seen by the person making the claim, even in the article where the 'salary' of £34k p/a was mentioned it states, past the point where anyone who didn't know the system would be seeing red, that they're living on about £106 per week.  

Do the math (sorry if I said there would be none, I am a habitual liar about such things).  

Weekly Income * Weeks per year = Total benefit received.

106 * 52 = 5,512. 


Total recieved - total payment = amount 'missing'.

5,512 - 34,000 = -28,488.    

Hypothetically and for a giggle  Total payment / weeks of year = assumption about income.

34,000 / 52 = 653.84.

We're missing best part of £30k here somewhere aren't we?  It can't of gone to the claimant otherwise they'd be living on £600 a week not just over £100... but it went somewhere.   That is, I would suggest, a really cheeky landlord who realises he's not got DSS in the property, so he jacks the rent up well beyond what it originally was as the government can pay. 

&gt; why can't I say I want to move to London if I become unemployed?

You can put in a request for relocation to any of the London councils, housing associations if your situation allows for it.  They will consider all such valid requests on their individual merits, apply a points based system and if you score sufficient points you would be theoretically free to then relocate in to a London based property at your own expense with the usual paperwork to get housing benefit rolling and such.  Once a property was available and you had made your way to the top of the list naturally. 

I am perfectly fine with the system allowing that and you attempting to do so.  ",0,1380885853,null,0,false,0,cckunoj,t3_1nndmv,t1_cckunoj,t1_cckugj3,null,1429248791,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

                          Hart




Zaba at LB. He's played there before and being right footed, he is perfect to combat the way Ribery and Robben cut back into the pitch (see Robbens goal). Also Gael's defence was terrible. Micah got caught out by the overlapping runs of Alaba, but adding Milner as cover on the right when defending would counter that. (Id swap yaya and milner so JM was on the right).

So mine would be a 4-1-4-1, I think your choice of 4-3-3 would leave the midfield even more overrun than we actually had, becuase they ended up having a 6 man midfield. By basically mirroring their formation, we would have made it basically man for man. Aguero dropping deep like muller did.


If we are trying to just pinch a win, or draw. 4-3-3 all the way. Its how Mourinho combated Pep's Barca - and it worked to some extent. The 4-3-3 would be a 2 DM one, Yaya playing defensively, Fernandinho doing his usual, and Silva playing more advanced. Aguero on the left, Navas on the right and Negredo in the middle holding it up. With that it would be defend defend defend, then counter. Unfortunately the big flaw in Barca, their slow defense doesnt really apply to Bayern so im not sure about how well it would work TBH.

And the added expense of living in London, even at Tesco's there is an additional cost associated. 

&gt; it's not the landlord jacking up rent for DSS that's the market value of the area you choose to live in.

Yes, either when they had the financial resources to do so of their own accord OR and that house is already marked as 'social housing' and they were allocated it using the points scoring system and availability of properties 'somewhat' suitable for their needs.  Which is something neither of us have considered:  a percentage of any new builds is earmarked for social housing, this is irrespective of if the builds are in nice areas or not.  

&gt; presumably my request to live for free in London would be denied, what Im asking is would you be ok if the system actually allowed me to do that?

I doubt it would be outright denied, however with no other reason for seeking the relocation other than 'I kinda want to' you would score very few points and be considered a low priority for housing in that or indeed any other area outside of where you live or your home town (if the two are different).

There is a difference and the system already allows you to attempt what you are suggesting.  Which I am perfectly fine with.

Let's think of some examples. Red Ed's dad is dragged through the mud, they kick off because a) the DM did it, and b) they like Ed to a reasonable degree. David Cameron's dead dad is dragged through the mud by The Guardian, and his bins are raided by The Mirror, and we don't hear a peep. Because they dislike Cameron and like The Guardian/Mirror. 

Some people on an EDL march shout racist shit. They don't like them, so that's a very big deal and proves everything they ever believed about that group. The Lefty march outside the Tory conference has members who call a black man an uncle tom for being in the Conservative party. Not a peep from the Guardian over this... none whatsoever. 

The DM's reporters pitch up at Ed's uncle's memorial to ask questions. Very very big deal. Stephen Fry gets drunk, argues with and insults Peter Hitchins at his own brothers funeral, then tweets about it. They like Fry and don't like Hitchins, so it's excusable. No biggy.

The list goes on and on. The funny thing is that I agree with the Left on most of the things they say that people did wrong - e.g. the DM being twats.

Who do you think hated Britain more? And this isn’t just about Ralph Miliband actually because it’s opened up a whole debate about the Daily Mail. You want to talk about who hates Britain… [minor chuntering from Letts]… This is a paper that in recent years said there was nothing natural about the death of the gay pop star Stephen Gately, who said that the French people should vote for Marie Le Pen and the National Front, who attacked Danny Boyle for having a mixed raced couple in the Olympic Ceremony, who called Mo Farah a ‘plastic Brit’. So let’s have the debate about who hates Britain more because it isn’t a dead Jewish refugee from Belgium who served in the Royal Navy, it’s the immigrant-bashing, woman-hating, muslim-smearing, NHS-undermining, gay-baiting Daily Mail.”

Bad keeping? Partially. But it's easy to use Joe as a scapegoat for poor defense. In each of the goals I mentioned there were **major** defensive flaws; none of which Joe is responsible for. You can't point the finger at bad goalkeeping when he is constantly in 1 on 1 situations and up against strikers in more space than NASA.

I agree that he isn't on top form, but taking him off the pitch will make matters worse. His confidence will be dented, more pressure to perform, nervous in front of goal not to mention the best way to get better is by playing! Jovetic has never been the same since he was out injury at fiorentina, regaining form isn't a case of tough love.

I like pants, but Joe is out first keeper and always will be. He is also the only English player to start for us and on his day is easily the best keeper in the PL.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"Not a fan of this. Waffling follows:

We saw how it works for counter-attacks, but how well does it work for slower build-ups and possession based play? Two strikers right up the pitch pretty much kills your chances of building through midfield, no matter who your ""number 10"" is. Against teams playing standard 4-2-3-1, the 3 press lucas and gerrard, the 2 cover moses/alberto/coutinho and the only pass is to the isolated wingback. 

Brendan mentions them being 9.5s or whatever, if we want to control the ball they need to be dropping in and linking more than waiting at the defensive line for a long pass. Occassionally a certain trigger could send them upfield - that trigger might be gerrard getting the ball in space with an opposition fullback out of position as on sunday. However, most of their work has to be done between the lines, where as we develop the play our formation is a strikerless 3-4-3-(0). For added variety Moses can even move forward into the space vacated if the centre halves push on to suarez or sturridge.

About the second goal on sunday, look at the position Moses takes up on their right back when Gerrard gets the ball (its on the carra/nev analysis video). It's not just sturridge and suarez up top that makes it work, if Moses stays in the ""hole"" the right back tucks in to cover suarez, potentially cutting out the ball across. As it happens the right back is behind the play after covering Moses (and makes a pretty weak effort to  get back).

My other problem with having 2 strikers is the pressing. Brendan mentions being deep in our half and unable to press, we should be hoping that this doesn't happen often. The thing.is that having 2 up top pretty much renders the first line of midfield pressing useless. Because the wingbacks are out wide the only player there is Moses, therefore we are unable to press high up, therefore we end up dropping deep, unable to press, the forwards stay high up the pitch, meaning we don't press .....

Compare to the 4-2-3-1 from the stoke game. Every time a Stoke midfielder tried to bring the ball out a combination of Henderson, Aspas and Coutinho, sometimes supplemented by Lucas or Gerrard would be all over him. Now imagine Aspas is right up the pitch with Sturridge, Henderson is out wide at wingback, leaving little Phil to deal with Stoke's midfielders. Lucas tries to help but they're still outnumbered, the ball is played behind him and they're at our backline. If we have a genuine plan of sitting deep, inviting teams to attack us and then opening them up with two or three passes, fine. It was a good plan second half at villa, with suarez and sturridge available we would have been more dangerous on the counter too. But if we're going to try to press, and generally look to control the ball in possession its just not going to work and requires one if not both of suarez and sturridge to generally play deeper.

true,ir_h,flair8,,"I'm not an etymologist but I posted a bit of my position with regard to the word yid on /r/soccer earlier as a response to someone comparing it to a hypothetical scenario regarding the word ""nigger""; 

&gt; First of all the term yid didn't start off as being a derogatory word. There was a weekly jewish newspaper in New York called 'Der Yid' which originated in 1953. In Yiddish, the term 'yid' is colloquially used as 'mate' or 'buddy' and 'Reb yid' is used as a polite/formal way of addressing someone. Tottenham, as an area of London, has a long history which is intertwined with Jewish immigrants for over a century. For a substantial period of time supporters of other clubs, and a significant portion of the general population, have held quite a negative view of people of the Jewish faith. As an example, back in the 1960s, the Oxford-English dictionary had 2 definitions of Jew; ""Jew"" – the noun: ""Person who drives hard bargains, usurer"" and the verb: ""to Jew - cheat, bargain with (person) to lower his price."" This sentiment made supporters of Tottenham Hotspur a target for these anti-semitic sentiments which permeated amongst some supporters in the already quite violent firm culture of the mid 20th century. Yid was used derogatorily in the same way the term 'jew' was seen negatively, and the supporters basically just took it back. Nothing complicated about it. Supporters of Tottenham use the term now as a form of endearment, it's ingrained in it's culture and it's used in the same form as it is in Yiddish.
&gt; Opposing fans have now resorted to making gas sounds instead, and in all honesty, saying 'yid' alone towards any spurs supporter will not do anything - it no longer holds any power towards the fans. However, use ""fucking yid"" towards someone and of course there's a difference then, in the same way ""fucking jew"" or ""fucking gooner"" or ""fucking northerner"" etc etc etc, it all comes down to intent.
&gt; Instead of nigger, I would rather look at the word queer as an example. Queer was previously used to describe someone or something eccentric, it then was then used as a derogatory term for people who are attracted to the same sex and now since the 1980s it was 'reclaimed' by the homosexual community, it no longer carries any weight.

I posted a link yesterday here on /r/coys from the BBC which is quite interesting; http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/24240085 where they interview a woman named Helen Beer who is a lecturer in Yiddish at University College London and a native Yiddish speaker (UCL is one of the most respectable universities in the country).

true,IRONic__MAN,lfc68,,"I can see where you're coming from with Allen's passing. Personally I think he is too much of a crab, in games against teams who are tough to break down he is incredibly frustrating to watch because he doesnt have the eye for a killer pass, or if he does he is just too scared to try it.

Gerrard not only has the eye for a killer pass but now he has refined his game a bit he can do all of that simple passing which Allen is so effective at. Now I dont know about you, but I'd rather have someone playing who has variety in his game and who plays the situation. Allen will play the same way every game, it can look great when we're winning, but when we're struggling he is the first player I want off the pitch.

&gt; This is largely because Gerrard usually lumps it 50 yards and loses the ball, sometimes this works (2nd goal v sland) but more often than not it doesn't

That is a massive generalisation. Gerrard had a poor game against Soton, and a decent game against Sunderland. I think you are basing this line on that. He has reigned in his long passes a *lot*. He invariably keeps it on the ground these days and throws the odd long ball in when needs must.

Seriously, dropping one of our best players (and captain) for someone who can only be described as a flop up to this point would be the most nonsensical and reactionary things Rodgers could possibly do. I'd lose a little bit of faith in him if he did it tbh. Maybe to give Gerrard a rest, but as a long term solution Allen aint the answer.",0,1380894771,null,0,1380896382,0,cckwhxj,t3_1npv3y,t1_cckwhxj,t1_cckw6t1,null,1429247932,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

That's a view you're entitled to hold, indeed it's the view that the anarchists held about Marxist-Leninism at the time of the Russian Revolution, and arguably they were ultimately proved exactly right. However, it's not what we were discussing and it'd be nice if you admitted that with grace.

&gt;Anyone can spout ideals it's the implementation and the intention that counts.

Of course they can, and you are right. However, I'd argue that the intents of at least many of those who made revolution in Russia were noble, it was the implementation which sucked.  I could make many excuses for them - that they made a revolution in the wrong country (a basically agrarian feudal society with massive poverty), that they were forced into a terribly expensive peace having borne the brunt of the First World War, and subsequently had to deal with an invasion by the Western powers, civil war, and ultimately the Nazi atrocities on the Eastern front and a Second devastating World War fought largely on their territory for much of its duration.  Then they were strangled during the Cold War and had their economy slowly bled dry with an arms race they couldn't afford, tit for tat proxy wars across the developing world, relentless encouragement of sedition by the capitalist West, (natural) famine, etc. etc.  But none of this excuses the actions of Stalin, nor even those of Lenin and Trotsky and other Bolsheviks.

Ultimately, the failure of the Soviet Union was a political failure, and it was one which was pointed up at the outset - you can't seize the State and make it work in the interests of all the people, because that's not how States work, the State will always serve the interests of an elite, whether public or private.

&gt;Communists are just bigger *unts than the average political demagogues; teasing the masses with dreams of paradise before royally *ucking them.

Actually being patriotic in England is usually associated with racists and so people usually don't say anything patriotic. 

3) People's accents vary a lot more

4) People are often quite negative about the USA here and a bit xenophobic about ""stupid americans"". 

5) We don't really have customer service here. People in shops won't wish you a nice day or go out of their way particularly much to help you

7) Quite a lot of things are sold in metric (e.g. food) but some stuff is still in imperial like milk and beer. Annoyingly petrol (gasoline) is sold by the litre but car fuel efficiency is measured in miles per gallon. Fuel is a lot more expensive here and public transport is a lot better

CheckMEND is the industry version where places such as Game, CEX, and independent pawn shops check serial numbers for stolen goods, they use the same database.

I dont really know what extra he could provide in terms of cover than Gerrard could. At least Gerrard gets stuck in and throws his body on the line. He's great for those crunching challenges which gee up the crowd and inspire the players around him. Something tells me that Joe Allen bundling in to the back of an opponent on the edge of the area who is going nowhere wont quite have the same effect. 

And is Joe Allen really fast? He always looked pretty sluggish to me last season, maybe it was his injury but he's never struck me as someone who I would classify as having any pace.

Dictionaries are notoriously bad at providing definitions for political ideologies.  They define anarchism as chaos, for example.

Kids have said that about wearing uniforms generally since...well, forever. And religious reasons shouldn't, IMHO, have anything to do with school to that degree.

It does on several levels. Immediately those children are singling themselves out as different, which in turn raises the problem of any religious garb carrying the subconcious message 'I am of this faith, therefore I am better than you'. Wearing a small crucifix (for example) does the same thing, but the larger the difference, the bigger issue it becomes; that's why the burque/ niqab thing can be contentious - I can't think of a more extreme demonstration of segregation based on what is ultimately a cultural (not religious) excuse.

The hooks/clickbait are the feel good stories like a saved polar bear, the earthporn pictures, celebrity gossip and pictures of underdressed women.

Once they have you looking they can then start writing their junk which is primarily designed to play on your emotions. If they can get you riled up then the part of your brain that processes emotion very much overpowers the part that processes logic. That is, you're so pissed off that you don't think to fact check. People will spend literally hours on facebook whining about a completely made up story, rather than take 5 minutes to verify it with other sources. More bizarrely but a testiment to how strong this emotional playing is, the mail hates women and gay people, but a good number of women and gay people still buy every day.

Next we have affirm by repetition. Repeat this cycle of stories every day on whoever they currently hate. Bash people who follow Islam, or people with brown skin, or the nhs or police or government etc. Emotional repetition is immensly powerful and it keeps people coming back to affirm that what they now believe is true.

So now you tie all of this together and you get a big readership. This brings in the next part: affirmation by consensus. Hey, 3 million people all read the Mail so it can't be wrong, can it?

If we can bring in 3-4 players in the £20m+ range this summer, we would have an extremely strong XI and an incredible squad. But, that will only happen if we secure top 4, and it may also require the sale of Suarez to make that kind of money available.

I'll use some modern episodes to illustrate. I won't list the occurences of visible flight too much; just the notable instances:

* *The Christmas Invasion*: The TARDIS [enters normal space from the vortex](http://i.imgur.com/adA0slC.png) several meters above the ground, at which point it continues until it [crashes in a less than graceful manner](http://i.imgur.com/OPerL1f.png).

* *The Runaway Bride*: There is some conventional flight seen in this episode, though evidently quite strenuous, possibly because the TARDIS isn't used to that mode whilst not in open space. What was unusual was that at the end of the episode, though we saw it begin to phase, the TARDIS was shown [shooting out of the atmosphere instead](http://i.imgur.com/P8k3jM9.png).

* *Journey's End*: After phasing out of the Crucible's core, it was shown [phasing into normal space in conventional space flight](http://i.imgur.com/hXP1xQi.png).

So, ordinarily, the TARDIS dematerialises, at which point it will rematerialise inside normal space, or into the time vortex, which it will traverse, and then once the destination is reached, it will leave the vortex and reverse the process, rematerialising at the destination.

The healthcare system, flawed as it is, is still much better for the average person than the equivalent in the US.  No co-pays, no deductibles or whatever  (have forgotten the terms!) just go to a GP if you need to.  I liked the Dutch and German systems better than the NHS but I'd choose the NHS any day over the US. 

Houses are much smaller and much more expensive, depending on the area.  They're often better quality, fwiw.  My house in the UK is brick, not siding which is so often used in the US (I've never seen it here; doesn't mean it doesn't exist, ofc)

Roads are very small and it's a learning process to get to the point where you can negotiate them well.  This is more difficult that the wrong-side-of-the-road thing, for me.  

Population density is high here, very high compared to the US in general.  There isn't a lot of the great outdoors, either, so these two facts = every public park is rammed full on the few sunny days we have. 

Not only is the weather worse (cloudy, rain which lasts for days because it's rarely a driving rain, just some weather system that hovers right over your spot like you're Charlie Brown or something) but the sun is very low in the sky in the wintertime.  I really notice the shorter days here in the winter.

Positives: Food is served in normal portions, not so many shopping malls, easier to walk places, politics don't have gun laws, abortion and gay rights on the agenda (they're assumed as rights, it's just not even an issue) so politicians tend to focus on economic issues rather than social ones.  Religion- there are religious people but they don't bang on about it.  

It's fine.  I quite like it here.  I had my son here, I have heaps of friends here, I own a home and we're all happy.  I realise I'm complaining a lot in this post but hopefully the homegrown Brits will get that my complaints aren't particularly different from their own.  I could ramble on for ages but if you have specific questions, that might help narrow things down a bit!

Agree with folks saying you'd need to sort out paperwork re: your father.  Moving here otherwise is near impossible without work visas or marriage.

They are indeed, but they can be as different as they like *once they're people*. Before that, they're children - and it's during that age that we must teach them to get on with each other first, instead of giving them a lesson in segregating themselves.

&gt;I thought you agreed that segregated schools were bad?

I do. I also think that anything that encourages people to segregate *themselves* from others is not to be encouraged. Dress like a full-on punk if you like, but don't be surprised when people make assumption about your book when you've made the cover so scary. Dress like a gansta, don't be surprised when people treat you as such (and so on).

I'm afraid it isn't, it's a long-established consequence. One thing you cannot control about your appearance is how others then perceive you. If our lifespans were 100x longer, we'd have *time* to not-judge-books-by-their-covers, but nobody has time to read every book in the world to find that out, so how you present yourself has far more to do with how you want to be perceived and almost nothing to do with how you see yourself.

Left voters are rent-seekers. They seeks privileges and subsidies from the state. For example the classic French train workers defending their ridiculous benefits including retirement in their early 50's. They are a bourgeois interest group using their power to benefit themselves, the few, at the expense of the many. While they kick back in their slippers the working poor are slaving away to pay their benefits. It's no coincidence that the average Guardian reader is so affliuent: http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2012/08/22/Printreaderprofile.pdf Wealthier than average, bitterly jealous of those wealthier than them and secretly contemptuous of poor. That's a socialist.

I don't believe the Austrian economic perspective is voodoo at all. Yes it does reject empiricism, that is necessary if you accept the human element, and therefore subjectivity of value judgements. That's isn't to say that data isn't useful. Nassim Taleb is an example of someone who has an appreciation of what can and cannot be achieved with empiricism its pitfalls. Funnily enough he's quite Austrian.  

Capitalism, or the free market is perhaps agnostic to democracy, however democracy is certainly an advocate of the free market. When you protect democracy, you protect social welfare and the free market. The Swiss manage to trade freely while caring for each other and their democratic freedom. I like the Swiss :)

WTF?  That's a meaningless non sequitur.  Anarchism = tax haven?  what the fuck are you smoking?

&gt;Stop using the term capitalism incorrectly. Do you not understand how to use words properly?

Your understanding is woefully limited.  Sorry, I don't demean people lightly, but it genuinely is.  You have no understanding of the history of the term, who invented it and where it came from.  You just looked it up in a dictionary, defined by a person who probably has no political education and who works for a capitalist corporation.

Capitalism is anti-democratic.

How so?

Then why aren't they in power?

&gt;They have the intellectual curiosity of a gnat and think themselves rebellious. 

Meaningless insult.

&gt;Left voters are rent-seekers. They seeks privileges and subsidies from the state.

WTF.  You're really showing your ignorance here.  Do you have the remotest conception of how much rent the state pays to capitalists compared to the tiny tiny amounts which are paid to ordinary working people?

&gt;They are a bourgeois interest group using their power to benefit themselves, the few, at the expense of the many.

Working people are bourgeois?

&gt;While they kick back in their slippers the working poor are slaving away to pay their benefits.

You need to seriously clarify what you're claiming here.  Are you attacking unionism?  In which case I have major issues with management-oriented and bourgeois unionism too.  Unions need to be radically democratic, have delegated part time leaders rather than representative full time ones (with a strong right of recall), and need to be organised syndically and industrially by sector rather than by job.

&gt;Capitalism, or the free market

False equivalence.

&gt;is perhaps agnostic to democracy

The former is antithetic, the latter, equivocal.

&gt;however democracy is certainly an advocate of the free market.

It means that the price will increase as it takes more dollars (now worth less) to make up the value of that share.

The data protection thing isn't ""hiding"", it's the law. Central government introduced it and police officers start getting sacked if they breach it. I'd say an officer being able to feed their family and pay the mortgage is a fairly good reason to not disclose these things.

Slap on the wrists is a punishment given out by the courts; again nothing the police can control.

My issue with your post is use of the word Filth; I don't walk around openly calling ""the public"" c**ts, even the ones who are.

As for doing a little more to get people's stuff back, you'll see from my other posts on the topic that I'm actually quite keen on the idea.... It's sort of THE BASIC REASON I DO MY JOB. In this country we have a right to avoid self-incrimination, again not introduced by the police. The thieves barely ever admit to the theft, let alone tell you where the stuff went.
I'll remind you that we're not in the 1940's any more and torturing the information from people is a little bit illegal.
Besides which, within the space of a day stolen property can change hands multiple times.

I think your anger is simply misplaced and you just jumped on the anti-plod bandwagon like a DM reader.

Also without wishing to blow my own trumpet, I'm not one of the nasty policemen you suggest I am, unless you're stood in the street calling me Filth.
