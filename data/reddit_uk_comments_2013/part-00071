B: So the government spent money subsidizing uneconomical mines at a cost to society and for the benefit of a few?

C: I completely disagree. Keeping them open would have cost more money than closing them. The subsidization of those mines in the first place is what caused the stagnation of those towns after the mines closed. Interfering with an economy is great as long as you can continue to do it indefinitely. Not to mention the economic inefficiencies.

No you cannot argue that the state built an empire of the backs of these people. The empire brought increased material well being to these people. Only someone completely ignorant of the economic history of Britain from 1800 to 1979 would make the statement that Britain's working class did not benefit from the British empire. And no, the state does not owe people anything. That is the fundamental problem with the extreme left wing in Britain. The idea that everyone is owed something by the government. It is that ideology that effectively destroyed those communities.

D: Your chart shows rising incomes for the poor. They have not stayed where they were. Furthermore, Thatcher's reformed drastically increased the economic freedom of everyone in Britain.

Keynesian ideas led the British government begging for emergency funds from the IMF in 1979.

And she has all of those hacking skills now that Oswin clearly displayed. Perhaps the trauma of the Dalek conversion is why Oswin doesn't remember the Doctor. Oswin fought the conversion, but they still took parts of her away to make her a Dalek. And those lost parts include memories of the Doctor."")

Maybe the force of the Asylum exploding somehow sends her back to the Victorian era and once again messes with her memories?

She has an almost subconscious mirroring of modern-day Clara, looking after children yet retaining her sense of adventure and desire to travel. And, oddly, despite what Clara said about thinking the TARDIS didn't like her, the first time Clara Oswin Oswald interacts with the TARDIS up on the cloud, it seems to hum in recognition of her.

Suarez likes to roam, and while he's good at pressuring opponents in their half and winning the ball back, he's not really great at tracking back to defend.

Coutinho isn't great at it either.  Sturridge, no way.  Downing is good, but he can't make up for all of it on his own, especially when you consider how Glen likes to bomb forward on his side.

Even with Lucas/Gerrard as the holding mids, we can't control the midfield.  And if you do play Suarez in the hole, then either Gerrard has to cut down on his tendency to roam or we'll be even more exposed.

The truth is, that lineup is simply too attacking.  It looks sexy on paper- there aren't many attacks in the league better than that- but this isn't FIFA where you just put in all of your high-rated players and hold A on defense.

You need someone besides Lucas doing the leg work in midfield.  This is (part of) why Hendo is pretty fantastic at AM for us.  He's got an engine and he's got the positional sense and he's got the tackling.  He runs forward when he needs to, but he also covers when he has to, especially if Gerrard's moving to attack mode.

I'd prefer a front three of Sturridge in the middle, then Suarez on the right or the left, depending on whether we play Coutinho or Downing.

What is the alternative for long term unemployed who are being turned down because they don't have the right skills or experience? Leave them to it? Continue to put them forward for roles they have no chance of getting? 

I understand people's issues with the crap intern positions. Getting hired to work in a marketing company &amp; only getting to make coffee. That sucks &amp; people who treat interns that way should be ashamed of themselves. That is exploitation &amp; not the true spirit of internship.

Those on JSA could be considered better off than the unpaid interns. At least they are getting some payment to support them while they try &amp; gain enough experience/skill to get long term work. 

Why do people think that the world owes them a living? I believe in  giving people a helping hand &amp; making sure they don't go hungry. I also think people need to help themselves as much as they are able. 

Obviously there will always be exceptions &amp; unfortunate cases, but if you are able to you should try &amp; support yourself. Sometimes that will be hard &amp; require sacrifice. 

It would surely be better to place emphasis on an agreement- if you take on an intern you have to provide adequate training, mentoring &amp; support.

true,ExtraneousMachine,null,null,"I'm doing all three of those IGCSEs, and I'd say they're all pretty easy to remember - Biology is probably the hardest, as it has the most factual recall. 

My tips: If your school has any past papers available, work your way through them until you're confident you can deal with them. It's kind of a cross between a confidence test and actual revision, since you should remember the questions you've got wrong before.

Try and make a format for answering each of the most popular types of question. For example, on Physics, when working out a value you need to write the formula, substitute the numbers, find the result and add the correct units for full marks. Knowing what you need for full marks can help a lot to de-stress and make writing answers easier.

If any classmates are doing the same exam and understand less than you, try and explain to them. Explaining things to other people is a very good way of making sure you know what you are talking about.

Physics is mostly maths, and you know the formulae and have a calculator. If you can, try and revise the topic and the maths that goes with it at the same time. If you are quite good at maths, the fact that your calculations match what you think should happen should be reassuring.

Chemistry is mostly about remembering the rules that particles and chemicals interact by. Match each rule with a common example, such as sodium hydroxide (a common example of a base) plus hydrochloric acid (a common example of an acid) reacting to give table salt and water as an example for a metal hydroxide and acid reaction. For more complex tasks, you could also make each fact you have to remember a square on a large chart. Write the things in the squares, colour each square differently to help remember and then put it up somewhere you'll see it often. 

Other ways of testing yourself are good, too - if you have a revision list, just look over it and think 'do I know that now?'. If you remember it, revise something else first.

Revise in a light room, preferably uncluttered and with lots of space, as not only will it help you stay organised but research shows that people remember things better in similar conditions to when they learned them - essentially, try to give it the feel of an exam hall. Also, prioritise revision early in the morning and just before you sleep, as your long-term memory is most active then.

These methods all worked for me - across my mock exams, I averaged a score of 95% (higher than I expected). I hope your luck is just as good when you take your exams!",0,1365784702,null,0,false,0,c9dubwp,t3_1c7gdy,t1_c9dubwp,t3_1c7gdy,null,1431581141,2,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,2

You just don't and if you're at all good with people, with selling it won't be 3 years until going up the ladder. 

It's not like working like an editorial internship or one for a designer or something. Not like me working for free for two years for two photographers to learn a real craft. That killed me money-wise but that was well worth it. Anyone with half a brain can pick up retail skills in a week or less. I was managing stores at 18 after just working p/t for Sears. That was all the ""training"" I needed to step up into a basic management retail job and from there I went on. I managed other stores, then became an area manager, and yeah, there was extra training for that sometimes but it was paid. 

Retail internships? Please. Might as well ""intern"" to run a candy concession at the movies or to take orders at McDonald's. It's the same thing and it does not require that much in depth on the job training. Unless they're promising them all management jobs after six months, and I'll bet they are not, I think this is total BS. No one needs to ""intern"" to work as a sale clerk or whatever they're calling it these days. One week of register and basic sales training and you should be getting paid. If you are not? Leave.

I completely agree with your ambitious attitude. We gained a level of achievement which should be our benchmark, and never fall below it. And we did this time, its not something we should be proud of but maintaining the pride and not flaking out from the it should also we accepted and live with. We might not deserve the CL spot but we definitely shouldn't have lost it the way we did this easily.

Your comment saying we are in the final four of Europa is not commendable irked me. It is commendable and worth achieving at this stage.

IMO, winning the Europa is just a way to say, even though we got kicked out off from CL we are better than Europa and we proved it rightly.

What in the holy fuck? Do you think we are voting for the SNP or a Salmond dictatorship? I don't even like Salmond.

It's about having a government that represents us. The chances are that the Scottish Labour Party will dominate the polls because the SNP will cease to exist upon a Yes vote. And get this: the Scottish Conservative Party will be free to make it's own policies without Westminister vetting, meaning that they will start to win seats based upon more popular policy. And all of this will take place under a Proportional Representation framework meaning that the smaller parties are not silenced by the powerful.

I wished I was old enough to vote at the time but sadly I wasn't and by the time I finally was it was clear New Labour wasn't everything it was cracked up to be anyway. Now I can't even decide if it would be worth my time to turn up to the polling station.

I think you do New Labour and Tony Blair a disservice by saying that the 97 result was merely due to public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of the time. If that's even remotely true then Labour is nothing more than an opposition party, and exactly what Mr Blair is accusing the current party of.  

Mr Miliband isn't doing anything like as being pro-active as New Labour was. He is simply sitting back and expecting the voters to come to him. What action he does take is shifting Labour's position to the Left expecting that the public opinion has also, when in reality there is little evidence to suggest this. He's pandering to the Unions and the Labour strongholds, but ignoring the fact he's preaching to his choir. Yes, the current polls put Labour ahead, but I feel that Labour need to be doing more to convince people that the coalition government isn't taking Britain in the right direction and that they have policy to answer the problems we are currently facing as a nation. Currently they have nothing to say, having dodged the issues of our country's deficit and welfare reform countless times. They offer no solutions or vision, merely opposing government reforms with no clear alternative. All this from a party that is seemingly facing increasing internal divisions. 

This is happening to a backdrop of a coalition government that is armoring itself in the impression of fiscal responsibility, attempting to divide and conquer the country with their ""Strivers and Skivers"" rhetoric, while they point out Labour's past wasteful excess. They thrive in an environment where they know they will be despised by the left, they see themselves as making tough but responsible decisions and that's the image their selling to the electorate.

If Labour sits on their laurels now I can't say I expect them, or possibly any other party, to be in a position to take a majority vote.",0,1365786093,null,0,false,0,c9duutp,t3_1c71uu,t1_c9duutp,t1_c9dsgpf,null,1431580893,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There's certainly an argument that the SNP would be contradicting themselves if they argued that autonomy made sense for Scotland but not Shetland, but I don't think it's a particularly strong one. E.g., what would distinguish those islands wanting to opt-out from Glasgow wanting to opt-out? Or Maryhill opting out? Or Duart Street in Maryhill? Or 18 Duart Street? Or the upstairs bathroom in 18 Duart Street?

The only real reason to think of the islands as a special case is that there's a significant enough cultural or political distance between them and the rest of Scotland. Some people feel there is, some don't.

&gt; But it's the plight of individual boys and girls which worries me most. Too often, our children don't get the education they need—the education they deserve.
And in the inner cities—where youngsters must have a decent education if they are to have a better future—that opportunity is all too often snatched from them by hard left education authorities and extremist teachers.
And children who need to be able to count and multiply are learning anti-racist mathematics—whatever that may be.
Children who need to be able to express themselves in clear English are being taught political slogans.[fo 6]
Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay.
And children who need encouragement—and children do so much need encouragement—so many children—they are being taught that our society offers them no future.
All of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life—yes cheated.
Of course—in the country as a whole—there are plenty of excellent teachers and successful schools.
And in every good school, and every good teacher, is a reminder of what too many young people are denied.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;Obviously talking in general politics rather than specifics - the public also want capital punishment to return, reduced immigration and more thought Thatcher was great than thought she was bad (by a great margin). Are we saying that Labour should have done these things too?

The thing with capital punishment polls is they are usually taken shortly after the media has been reporting in great detail about some grizzly murder. Even so I’ve never seen a poll that says the public wants capital punishment other than in specific circumstances i.e. for murdering a child or police officer.

It’s also understandable that the public wants reduced immigration as the press and some politicians use them as scapegoats for all of society’s problems. New Labour also messed up here by ignoring people’s concerns and labelling them as bigots. In generally having an opinion that immigration is too high is not bigoted, there are genuine concerns about how it affects society as a whole.

As for Thatcher, according to the poll in /r/unitedkingdom shows that 25% says she was great, compared to 23% who thought she was terrible, that’s not a huge margin.

Anyway this is all pretty irrelevant because I’m not saying Labour should blindly follow public opinion, I’m saying when the public are in favour of something and it fits Labours ideology anyway e.g. nationalisation and progressive taxation, they should do it. Blair didn’t do this because he had turned new Labour into a centre right party instead of a left wing one as they have traditionally been.

&gt;forces you to choose the least bad option. again the public have resoundingly chosen to keep that system so I doubt they also feel that it doesn't not let them choose what they want.

People didn't vote to keep FPTP, they voted against the alternative of AV. We didn't get a choice on whether or not we wanted to keep FPTP. Many people voted against AV because they actually wanted proportional representation, and they thought voting against AV would actually lead to this faster (I don’t agree with the logic but there was the no2AVYes2PR campaign).

&gt;I'm beginning to the think that one of the problems with the left of centre is this constant assumption that they represent the vast majority of how people feel... but the reality is often starkly different.

He is good man, but his very strong opinions got the better of him. There is no excuse for these comments, but I can show you how he is feeling right now.

""Dear all. 

Yes, it was me. I'm very ashamed, very sorry and very embarrassed, mostly for the Met, my colleagues, friends, family and lastly, myself. The Met have accepted my resignation, for which I thank them. 

The Met have behaved impeccably over this and I cannot praise the courtesy, professionalism, support, humanity and understanding of all I have dealt with over these last couple of days. 

My next step is to deal with the personal issues that have led me to this point and have caused me to overstep the mark one time too many. I lost sight of the line.

Alcohol and mental health led to a bad place although they aren't excuses, just catalysts. I was responsible for my actions. My thoughts should not have been expressed like that. I'm a better, more objective writer than that.

I think that's exactly what it should mean. I think a lot of people have taken the opposing opinion because we're so used to emotions trumping logic in similar situations. But in the case of a publicly-funded impartial media organisation, I think that's exactly what it should mean.

&gt; The BBC has a duty to be impartial, as you say, but there's also broadcasting guidelines relating to causing undue distress. All of these things have to be considered.

That comes under my issue with the BBC's guidelines being poorly defined. They contradict each other and don't seem to be well thought through. In this circumstance I feel they should have played the song. The fact that there guidelines suggest that shouldn't have happened is, in my view, a problem.

&gt; I think discussing it and playing a clip, with the given context, is a good way of acknowledging it while minimizing distress to the Thatcher family.

That's pretty what I'm saying should have happened, except that I don't understand the difference between playing the entire song and just playing a clip.

She may well have thought that homosexuality was morally wrong. Many people did then, and some still do. That is, however, irrelevant. She voted in favour of legalising homosexuality in 1966 and any personal views she may have held on homosexuality did not translate into anti-gay legislation.

&gt; Thatcher pushed into force her draconian legislation to make it a CRIME for any teacher in any school in England and Wales to say ONE WORD that was positive regarding homosexuality or homosexuals.
I was a teacher at that time and like 100s of other gay and lesbian teachers Thatcher made my life a hell. I remember clearly now that class of youngsters in inner-city Manchester who said to me one day, “Are you gay, sir? You ARE, aren’t you!” and Thatcher had effectively forbidden me to answer in any positive way. In fact her legislation was so insidious that it was dangerous to even answer the question for fear of some child going home and telling a homophobic parent (and there 1000s of them) that “Sir, told us he’s gay and you could tell he was proud of it!”
Thatcher’s insidious legislation meant that any parent had only to call the tabloids and you were finished, in the centre of a storm.

and 

&gt;The Thatcher government only ended the ban on gay sex in Northern Ireland after the European Commission ruled that it violated the European Convention. She appealed the initial ruling and forced the entire court to vote on it. I suppose she gets some credit for following the treaty finally, but had it been left to her Northern Ireland would still be sending people to jail for having private consensual gay sex.

This is especially true of students from Africa and India.

Having said that, they often do integrate better than those who are simply looking for an export degree. Although I would say, Chinese students cheat themselves out of the benefits of a western education by not learning about western culture more thoroughly. It restricts their insight into how the British think or do buisness internationally - not to mention it doesn't improve their English language skills nearly as much as it would if they were immersed in a non-chinese speaking enviornment 24/7.

It's part of a wider problem where many foreign migrants seem to want to enjoy the pleasures of a western life -but without fully embracing the culture associated with it.

As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990, Margaret Thatcher, who died on April 8, 2013, sought to stymie homosexual law reform and to restrict the existing rights of homosexuals. Her legacy in the area of gay rights is one of retrenchment and oppression and includes the notorious Clause 28, which established as a principle of British law the belief that homosexuality is a detriment to society. Enacted in 1988 and not repealed until 2003, it constituted a powerful symbol of the second-class status of gay and lesbian citizens in the United Kingdom.

In his authoritative glbtq survey of the struggle for equal rights in the United Kingdom from 1900 to the present, Richard G. Mann, characterizes the Thatcher era as one of ""moral retrenchment."" As he notes, the Thatcher's government systematically sought to halt the progress of gay rights.

Upon taking office in May 1979, Thatcher's new government announced that it would not extend the Sexual Offenses Act of 1967, which decriminalized homosexuality, to Northern Ireland. On March 6, 1980, the government rejected an amendment to a Housing Bill that would have given gay and lesbian couples the security of tenure already accorded to heterosexual couples. Later that year, it summarily rejected a petition requesting that discriminatory employment laws be reformed.

Even after the European Commission unanimously ruled in September 1980 that the sexual laws in Northern Ireland violated the European Convention, the Thatcher government refused to change the laws until the case was reviewed by the full European Court.

In 1981, the long awaited Report of the Criminal Law Reform Committee proposed that the Sexual Offenses Act of 1967 should be extended to servicemen and that the age of consent for private sexual acts between two men should be lowered to 18. However, no action was taken on these proposals while Thatcher was Prime Minister.

In October 1982, the government announced its intention to intensify prosecution of homosexual acts outside the scope of the 1967 Act. In that month, the Metropolitan Police raided a private party in West London and arrested 37 men, who were charged with engaging in homosexual acts.

After her landslide victory in June 1983, Thatcher emphasized her determination to secure passage of the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill (enacted 1984), which extended police powers of arrest in matters involving perceived affronts to public decency to a level not seen since the 1950s.

Even as the Bill was being debated, police activity against gay men increased. For example, on March 11, 1984, over 50 officers raided The Bell, a popular and cruisy gay pub in Camden (London), for a supposed infringement of licensing laws.

On April 10, 1984, Customs and Excise agents raided Gay's the Word, London's only gay bookstore, and confiscated thirty percent of its stock. Police held the store's directors and manager for questioning without access to lawyers. Later in April, a similar raid was conducted against Lavender Menace, Edinburgh, then Scotland's only gay bookstore.

As the Conservative Party shifted to a repressive moral stance, London Mayor Ken Livingston committed the Greater London Council (GLC) to opposing discrimination against homosexuals. In 1984, the GLC affirmed gay rights as part of its anti-discrimination policy and established the London Lesbian and Gay Centre.

Labour-dominated councils in other cities, including Manchester, Southampton, and Birmingham, instituted programs similar to those of the GLC. Incensed, the Thatcher government passed the Local Government Act of 1985, which abolished the GLC and other councils, effective March 31, 1986.

Influenced by the policies of the councils, Labour Party conferences of 1986 and 1987 supported motions to commit any future national Labour government to outlaw discrimination against gay men and lesbians. In the 1987 General Election, which was won by Thatcher, Conservative candidates routinely attacked Labour's pro-gay policies, using it as a wedge issue.

At the Conservative Party Conference held in October 1987, Thatcher expressed concern that children were being taught that gay lifestyles were acceptable. In December 1987, she announced her support for Clause 28, a law that prohibited government-supported institutions from teaching the normalcy of homosexuality and from making available any materials depicting homosexual relationships positively.

Stung by defeat in the recent election, Labour leaders initially refused to challenge this proposal, but the Party affirmed its opposition to the amendment by the beginning of March. The Association of Art Historians and other arts organizations also expressed their opposition to Clause 28. Coming out in the course of a BBC radio interview, prominent Shakespearean actor Ian McKellen emerged as a leader of the opposition to the amendment.

Reacting to the homophobia underlying Clause 28, gay men and lesbians throughout the country were roused to political activism. Over 10,000 lesbians and gay men participated in a march in London on January 9, 1988, two days before the House of Lords debated the measure. Even larger protests were held in subsequent weeks. After the House of Commons passed the legislation on March 9, protests against Clause 28 continued, including one held on April 30 in London that attracted more than 30,000 people.

By establishing as a principle of British law the belief that homosexuality is a detriment to society, Clause 28 constituted a powerful symbol of the second-class status of gay and lesbian citizens.

Although no one was prosecuted for violating Clause 28, the law achieved its goal of making local authorities cautious about funding material or events dealing with homosexual issues. Moreover, it proved very difficult to repeal, particularly because of its support in the House of Lords. The government of Prime Minister Blair was able to accomplish the task only in 2003.

If Margaret Thatcher's legacy is one of oppression and the misuse of state power, her policies also unintentionally led to a large number of glbtq people embracing political activism in response to her assault on their rights and dignity.

1. Yea, that was weird, but halfway through the episode, everyone started speaking in English, so maybe the Tardis took a while to set itself up with a new passenger? If it's the case that only the ""humans"" knew English, then that's just rubbish.

2. It wasn't a sun or planet. It was a being with that particular shape/size.

3. The Doctor did explain all that. Once the creature in the box got out and screamed, the Doctor admitted that he had made a mistake. He said that the creature wasn't the old god, as he had thought, but instead, it was the old god's alarm clock, so to speak. This means that what you're calling a planet or sun isn't any of those things but an actual creature (with a face). It eats what it eats. Why do you eat what you eat?

4. It wasn't a planet or a sun, but this isn't the first time that the Doctor deals with a planet/sun-type of being. Since it wasn't any of those two things, your other questions are moot (other than the gravity question - that one is still legit).

5. The peoples' religion wasn't about worshiping that old god, it was about keeping him from asleep so he wouldn't kill them all. Once he woke up, they were fully on board with either keeping him asleep or destroying him, if possible.

Neither Shetland nor Glasgow signed the Act of Union individually, Scotland did collectively.

So far there seems to be little in the way of an actual campaign to treat one part of Scotland differently from the rest, but I think in the case of the islands then if there was it would be worth considering.

That idea is not within the scope of the Edinburgh Agreement that the Scottish and UK governments have agreed on, and the UK government does not appear to be making any moves towards supporting it, but personally I think if (say) 99% of Shetlanders voted No then it might be worth considering ([here's an MSP](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17447906) saying much the same thing).

You appear to be implying that Scotland would require the islands to retain a claim over the North Sea oil fields? I think that is somewhat dubious, however I also think you are simply mistaken if you think Scotland requires oil to be independent.

Oil forms about 18% of Scotland's public sector revenues; that is significant, but it would not be essential (unless you are saying that independence would only be possible in the 100-150 year window in which we're extracting oil?).

* McDermott has only spoken to Shaun Harvey twice, and ""one of the owners"" (presumably David Haigh) briefly before the press conference. It's only from those conversations that he's drawn the necessary assurances of ambition, monetary backing, etc. Of course, this is excluding conversations with his agent - which I guess is where the bulk of the work has been done - but that does sound like an uncertain foundation on which the relationship between board and manager is forged. Then again, what can you expect when the process had to be rushed from summer to April?

* McDermott has washed his hands of player sales. He's passed the buck onto the board; if they want to sell a player, he'll go. However, he did at least talk about how he's lost completely vital players (Sigurdsson and Long) and still won a league title, so that does at least give me hope about properly moving on from the loss of Becchio (and Gradel... and Howson... and Snodgrass... and whoever else we lose in the summer).",0,1365796172,null,0,false,0,c9dyq9h,t3_1c7pwj,t1_c9dyq9h,t3_1c7pwj,null,1431578996,2,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,2

&gt;Controversy over applicability

After Section 28 was passed, there was some debate as to whether it actually applied in schools or whether it applied only to local authorities. Whilst head teachers and Boards of Governors were specifically exempt, schools and teachers became confused as to what was actually permitted and tended to err on the side of caution.

A National Union of Teachers (NUT) statement remarked that ""While Section 28 applies to local authorities and not to schools, many teachers believe, albeit wrongly, that it imposes constraints in respect of the advice and counselling they give to pupils. Professional judgement is therefore influenced by the perceived prospect of prosecution.""[24]

Similarly, the Department for Education and Science made the following statement in 1988 regarding Section 28:
“ 	Section 28 does not affect the activities of school governors, nor of teachers... It will not prevent the objective discussion of homosexuality in the classroom, nor the counselling of pupils concerned about their sexuality.[25] 	”

It is said that when Knight heard this, she was somewhat upset, remarking that:
“ 	This has got to be a mistake. The major point of it was to protect children in schools from having homosexuality thrust upon them.[25] 	”

In response to these criticisms, supporters claimed that the NUT and Department of Education were mistaken, and the section did affect schools.

Some local authorities continued to deliver training to their staff in their education system on how to deliver their services without discrimination against homosexuals. Manchester City Council continued to sustain four officer posts directly involved in policy making and implementation, contributing to the 1992 report (""Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988: a Guide for Workers in the Education Service, produced by Manchester City Council, May 1992."") which proved that Section 28 did not prevent this work.[11] Their pioneering work was never once challenged by the act.

Before its repeal, Section 28 was already largely redundant: sex education in England and Wales has been regulated solely by the Secretary of State for Education since the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and the Education Act 1996. Nevertheless, many liberal and conservative campaigners still saw Section 28 as a symbolic issue and continued to fight their own particular causes over it until its repeal.",0,1365796258,null,0,false,0,c9dyrhb,t3_1c7hpe,t1_c9dyrhb,t1_c9dxwbb,null,1431578980,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

proscuttio

sounds more like a mediterranean cigarette or a particular baking technique or ballet stance......0/10 points.

Salami

Sounds a bit like a brutal wrestling technique, I mean I think Zangief practices Salami but it also sounds like a friendly gesture, I mean if i was in a foreign country and someone said 'Salami!' to me, I'd be like not scared....I'd probably say 'Salami!' vack and wave, that's weak...2/10

Jerky

Jerky's different because it's an American cure and it's mental and it's like making chewng gum out of beef.  respect their rampant carnivoroussness but it's a bit fucking ott and it also sounds far too much like a teenage homosexual experience to be a contender in the deadly karate meats paradigm.

It would take a brave leap to blame the deaths of suicidal protesters who are already in jail for crimes they have committed on the policies of a person who wasn't in government when they were enacted. I'm not belittling the 'cause' insofar as the cause on this particular issue was the rights of terrorist prisoners. I am pretty puzzled by mainstream nationalism's taking up of this cause at the time though. The civil rights of the 60s/70s morphed into something a lot darker and murderous during 1981. That wasn't Thatcher's doing.

&gt;Many people in NI are socialist

I wouldn't go so far as to say socialist because in my head that's quite an extreme stance. Left-leaning sure. But many people in NI are connected to the building trade. Thatcher's policies undoubtedly helped that industry just as much as her reality jolt delivered to miners elsewhere. 

And as you say, when all's said and done disagreement over economic policies is hardly reason for street parties over a death. That's just plain stupid.

&gt;And as a matter of fact she lost the support of many unionists when she signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

That's the point I made in the blurb, thanks for the pointer to the error. Why then would NI nationalists hate her more so? Just anti-English/Tory/whatever bitterness?

true,Sammybeany,null,null,"If you have a receipt it doesn't matter one bit.  The item can be worn out and ten years old and they'll give you back exactly what you paid, so long as they can figure out what the item is and get the relevant matching UPC.  Kohl's store brands always have a tag with the UPC sewn into the hem or whatever, which makes it that much easier.  

It only becomes complicated if you earned Kohl's cash on the purchase and spent it.

Without a receipt the item loses value over time, but you can get around this by doing an even exchange on the item rather than a return.  Find something that matches the original MSRP of the item (customer service can typically find this out for you) and they can swap it out.  (Unless the item went clearance . . . in which case you have to find a clearance item that matches the clearance value.)  Otherwise, by returning it, you'll get a merchandise credit for some fairly arbitrary low dollar value that they say was the lowest price the item sold for.   

A bit complicated, but there's almost always a way to get a good value for your return.

(These are the policies of the store near me, at least.  YMMV.)

(Edit: I should add that returns without receipts can still work as if you had the receipt; If you paid with a charge card, there is a limited [although probably pretty lengthy] amount of time they can look up your purchase history for a fully reimbursed return.  They really bend over backwards to try to help people out with that sort of thing.)",0,1365799383,null,0,1365800282,0,c9dzy7v,t3_1c7og2,t1_c9dzy7v,t1_c9dzfro,null,1431578421,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

English Lit

1) Plan out the points you're going to say BEFORE you write the essay, not as you go along. Relate them to the question too, I plan out 4 points and have 4 paragraphs for each one. You can write out the 4 points at the start of the essay too, it forces you to stick to those points rather than waffle onwards.

2) EVALUATE and link back to question! This is how I learnt to go from A to an A* on my A View from the Bridge essay. Rather than pull out random quotes from your arse and give half hearted comments about the 'impact' it has. State the impact first and then give quotes to back up. It's kinda hard to say, but here's an example:

How does RLS make this such a moving extract? (For simplicity I'll just have one quote) 

'...under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body
jumped upon the roadway'

Bad: RLS has made this a moving extract because he describes the bones as being 'audibly shattered' which frightens the reader.

Good: In order to make this extract so memorable and moving to the reader, RLS has given a vivid and terrifying description of Carew's bones being shattered 'audibly', implying it was loud enough for all to hear.

Bottom line was, they were totally out-manoeuvered by the Conservatives, who have ran circles around them this entire parliament.

* Every good decision is conservative.

* Every bad decision is ""because of coalition"", and so by extension due to the Lib Dems.

* Tough measures like the tuition fees were engineered to be Lib dem policies.

* All in exchange for electoral reform they never even got.

Anyway, I think Clegg is just holding out in desperate hope that a split conservative-labour vote will force another coalition.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Interesting side story here. I was severely dyslexic (by severe I mean couldn't read *at all* till I was 13), and had an interesting family. So I ended up being home educated because schools don't help you for shit if you don't fit their little boxes. Anyway, this led to me doing two GSCEs at the last minute with the Hospital and Home Education Service who provided me with one on one lessons in maths and English. I had about 8 months to get from pretty much no knowledge (Although I could read and write relatively well by this point) to get a grade of some sort. 

I'd decided that I was able enough to handle a sixth form and so started to looking around. It turns out most of my friends went to the sixth form in the area with some of the highest standards short of a private school. *However*, I went on to get two Cs in my maths and English *and got in*. *But*, I also know people who did multiple GSCEs (like 8-10 roughly) but failed to acquire a C in English or maths and thus didn't get in.

I guess the moral here is, get a fucking C in maths and English. So long as you have that, everything else is an option.

Westminster has said that if we say no they will look into giving us more powers but frankly I don't even trust them as far as I could throw the houses of parliament. 

Last night I was described as a progressive regionalist by a friend, I support staying in the EU, while wanting to be out of the UK, a lot of people can't seem to get their heads around the idea, but for the most part the EU leaves countries to govern themselves, taxes, welfare, defense, education, and so on, right now Scotland has control of its own education policy but not the other three that I mentioned and those are the key issues for people who actually care about issues rather then blind nationalism.

So I want to live in a country that chooses not to spend billions on nuclear weapons that will never be used, and if they are well everyone will be dead anyway so there is no point in having them, I want to live in a country that takes care of the poor instead of the rich, that doesn't force the unemployed into unpaid work for private companies, I'd have had no issues if they were working for charities or for community projects instead of multinationals.

Sorry I feel I'm rambling a bit now so if you have anything specific you wanted to ask please feel free and I will answer it the best can, but the simplest way I feel I can get my point across is this, I want to live in a Scotland that has control of its own destiny, I don't want English people who have never lived here, making decisions on my behalf, and equally I don't want Scottish people to be able to make decisions that would have an effect on England, I'm deeply ashamed of the Scottish mps who voted to raise tuition fees in England, healthcare privatization and all the other awful polices because they wouldn't have dared to do it in Scotland, which is why while I dislike Salmond, he really is just awful, but at least the SNP have principles, they wont vote on matters at Westminster that wont affect Scotland.

If we have a manager who can give them good guidance as well as confidence and use them in a meaningful way then it is worth it took keep them around. It can really be a crapshoot when that happens though. If a youth player gets a game where we have a solid core on the pitch to guide them through a game then it's great experience. If they happen to be like one of 8 changes and we are playing a full reserve side then it's a waste. 

I also think back to where guys like Kakuta, McEachran, and Van Aanholt would be if Carlo wasn't axed and the pressure on him wasn't absurd. I'm quite happy with the level that Josh and PVA are playing at but neither are integrated with any of the players in our squad yet. 

I'm not sure which is better either and I think it is definitely a balancing act and IMO we missed a pretty big opportunity this season to start integrating some youngsters in the team when you consider our tremendously demanding fixture list.

We can be pretty sure that Santa does not exist because what he does defies everything we know about the laws of physics.  If someone wanted to disprove the existence of Santa it would be a relatively simple thing to do both scientifically using theory, and by simple observation.

When it comes to the existence of the universe and everything in it, and whether or not it was created by a supernatural being, things become a little more complicated.

It is still true that the burden of proof is on the person believing in the supernatural being, rather than the atheist having to prove there is none.  But in this case there is no way that this can be proved or disproved by any scientific means currently available.  You can talk about the likelihood of the existence or non existence of God but they will only ever be theories.  

Theists rely on blind faith, this is backed up by such arguments as everything around us was caused by something, therefore at the start of it all there had to be a creator.  The fact that we have a consciousness and the order found in nature cannot, they say, be just a coincidence.

Atheists also relying on blind faith, believe that there is no reason why the universe shouldn't have been around forever, infinitely cycling through big bangs, for example.  They point towards the fact that the universe tends towards chaos and entropy, and the fact that we are here is testament of a rare 'ordering'.  Something like giving a thousand monkeys with typewriters enough time typing at random for long enough, and coming up with the complete works of Shakespeare.  

Scientifically, we are still in the dark ages.  And this is the really important point. We have many theories about the universe and how it works, but they are being reviewed and changed according to what our increasing technology and therefore, scientific knowledge, is revealing.  But we are nowhere near being able to ascertain how it all got started, if it ever was started that is.

So in the case of the existence of God I don't think this hypothesis / null hypothesis applies.  There is no way we can prove or disprove either.

My own opinion is that given what little I have learned so far, there is no reason to believe that there is a God.  But I'm aware that this is a belief, not a proven fact and that is why I tend towards Agnosticism rather than full on Atheism.  But TBH I'd rather not be labelled at all, it causes all sorts of trouble in the world :)",1,1365803285,null,0,1365804957,0,c9e1cqk,t3_1c75ld,t1_c9e1cqk,t1_c9dzmda,null,1431577760,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;if the public don't like it then they're welcome to stop listening, same as all radio stations.

Actually, no. ALL licence fee payers have a say in what the BBC broadcasts, and if most of them complain about something, the BBC HAVE to listen. They can't just say ""if you don't like it, turn off"".

The BBC is very different from other radio stations, in that they operate under a Royal Charter, and that Charter specifically states that they have to listen to the views of the licence payers.

It is written into the charter that they have to:

'carefully and appropriately assess the views of licence fee payers;' and 'represent the interests of licence fee payers;'

Therefor, if the majority of the public want the BBC to *not* play the song, the BBC has a duty to listen to them, or risk losing their licence.

Akhet translates as the place where the sun rises &amp; sets, not the sun itself or its spirit. It is also a season (late summer). Second, the Doctor is clearly pointing to Akhaten when he says the people of the Seven Worlds believe life began on that planet. Even more clearly, that space rock floating in the ring is not a planet.

&gt; So easy to call him the devil after he's gone, as if he went because of a lack of popularity - the man who reinvented an unelectable Labour then won three General Elections in a row. Without that reinvention it's perfectly possible that Labour would've been out of power for 34 years by now; perhaps that's a little dramatic but you get my point.

Not really; Labour had been ahead in the polls since 1992 under the premiership of John Smith, prior to New Labour.

To boot, Blair only won 35% of the vote in 2005 (compared to 32% for the Tories), but stayed in power anyway due to FPTP, even though the vote was pretty close.

The BBC is a taxpayer funded radio station that has to be seen to remain impartial in all matters. It can't really take sides.

If they play this song, they're essentially playing a song that says ""haha Thatchers dead!"" nationwide. That's not what the song is about, but in this context it is. The sole reason that song is in the charts is because people celebrating the death of Thatcher made it so. 

Surely you can see why, from the point of view of public relations, the BBC would be reluctant to broadcast this song given the meaning it has recently acquired? They wouldn't normally play a song that literally celebrates someone's recent death, they're not going to do the same now.

Now, from the point of view of freedom of speech, expression etc I can see why you and others have your knickers in a twist. However, surely in this instance you can see why common sense and tact has to prevail?

The introduction to the wikipedia article on the word seems to attempt to give it every meaning conceivable.

But I don't really understand your thing about making claims - how does an atheist explain their belief (whether it is a belief that there is no God or belief that they don't know) without 'making a claim'? I don't see why it being unprovable is a problem - that's what faith is, and I know people who absolutely believe there is no God based purely on what they regard as an absence of the existence of one.

It's also a stated case thst two people can be driving a car at the same time. Such as in the case of a driving Instructor and student with dual controls. 

So, technically you're both right. I'm afraid I don't know who is eligible to pay for the damage as that depends on the instructors insurance. However, a driving student can definitely be at fault for committing motoring offences and causing road traffic collisions.

Oh Jesus titty-fucking Christ!! That was a clause hidden away in a bill pushed through parliament by nanny-staters in a vague ""think of the children"" way. It was ignored by the education system and barely anyone even heard about it. 

In case you don't know how the system works, the sitting prime minister doesn't personally approve acts of parliament, or even get a say in what gets passed, other than their vote as an MP.

This is a fucking pathetic attempt at Thatcher-bashing by bloggers just riding the thatcher hate for page views. You're a fucking idiot if you think this means anything.

The boning is actually directly on the side seam where it would be brought in, so it'd be opening up the entire lining, taking both the outside and lining in and then adding the casing/boning back to the lining. It's feasible, but tedious. It'd either be that or widening the lacing panel, which means moving all the loops. Let me think about that one for a bit. 

Making the skirt less poofy is just changes to the petticoat; it's the 12 metres of bridal crinoline that makes it huge. It's easy enough to take that off, which would leave the 10m of netting at the bottom and it would look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/BQRi2M1.jpg).

So, with God, although I generally take an agnostic position, I try to live what I consider to be a good life, but without the constant assessment of my actions according to the rather obscure sets of arbitrary rules in any number of mutually contradictory holy books or the fear that one or other deity will strike me down.",0,1365820072,null,0,false,0,c9e6iv5,t3_1c75ld,t1_c9e6iv5,t1_c9e2ulv,null,1431575253,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,theband65,null,null,"thats tough to say. The Hartnell years are a bit slow (especially most of the purely historical ones) but by season 3 most of the stories are incomplete. Youtube has some good reconstructions (stills from the stories with the original audio and added narration) but this can be very tough to get through. 
That being said, while the Hartnell years are pretty slow, the Troughton years are a good place to start because elements of what Doctor Who is today start to show. Personally I think Matt Smith plays the role like a modern day Troughton would've.
Skimming through the rest of Hartnell wouldn't be a big deal but there are some serials of his worth watching.
The Troughton years have slightly better effects (I do mean slightly) and less line flubs, but really what makes even the boring episodes exciting is the chemistry that Troughton and Jaimie have. 
SO to answer your question finish out season 2 (it'll be more of the same but has its moments) then restart at season 6 but watch The Ark, The Evil of The Daleks (most of its the reconstruction stuff but still a great serial), The Tomb of The Cybermen and The Ice Warriors.

If you ask me, the series gets progressively better and better but going forward from where you are right now is going to lead you straight into a lake of reconstructions. And I'll be honest, it's hard to get through. Nobody would blame you if you skipped through to Pertwee, where no episodes are missing, colour has been introduce, and the pacing has found a comfortable balance. But you will miss a lot of brilliant stories and characters.

So yeah. It gets better. But it's also very hard to get through. So you're going to have to decide how dedicated you are. I'll tell you this: The Second Doctor is still my favorite. Over half oh his episodes are missing and many episodes aren't great, but Troughton is one of the most brilliant things to ever happen to the show. And there are some great Hartnell stories ahead, too. And admittedly, some not-so-great ones. I suppose I'm starting to become redundant, so I'll bring this to a close.

true,ph33randloathing,mccoy,McCoy,"Well, look at it this way. It has to be an entity with sufficient power and resources to take control of the TARDIS and detonate it. That's no small feat.

We can probably rule out the Great Intelligence (since he's obscure, he doesn't seem sufficiently powerful, and I don't think even Moffat goes that far down the rabbit hole). There are no other existing adversaries in the relaunch canon capable of it.

It could be Omega, which might tie in really nicely with The Doctor's secret identity (especially if you believe that Moffat is making good on the aborted Cartmel Masterplan from the original show's last run). He's one of the. . . uh. . . two original Time Lords. And they brought back Rassilon, so why not Omega?

Alternately, it could be the Black Guardian. He's a pure manifestation of chaos and darkness whose power is theoretically limitless - proportional only to the prevalence of chaos and darkness in the universe. On the other hand, he wears a bird on his head.

I don't see a returned Master wanting to unmake reality, and Moffat has explicitly said he doesn't have any interest in bringing back The Rani.

As ugly as some or many elements of Islam may be,  the attack on Islam had been biased by an imperialist point of view.   Any number of ugly Muslim reactions had been provoked by territorial occupation,  resource theft,  collateral murder,  political interference,  etc for decades before the new atheists had become suddenly interested after 9/11 and the falsely attributed Anthrax incidents in the US,  both of which had investigations that were not truthful,  much as the JFK Warren commission had been a cover up.   Dawkins and Harris pretended that the Muslim acts of violence were unprovoked or at least totally unjustified and lied that Muslims were capable of such acts merely upon being influenced by their religion.   They were so successful at this hate speech,  rightfully called Islamophobia,  that all but the most intelligent and informed observers who were originally influenced by Harris and Dawkins remain much more hateful of Muslims than they would otherwise have been,  a very ugly legacy indeed and a hindrance to the necessary cultural healings that remain before us.   Atheism will emerge from this test stronger,  and the sooner it resumes the legal challenges the violation of the church separtion from state provisions of national laws and drops the moralistic preaching,  the better.

true,VikingHedgehog,mcgannnew,new McGann,"I'm also on my way watching classic Doctor Who. I started with what was on Netflix (not much) and so only saw 1 story for the first Doctor, 1 for the second, 3 for the third and then when I got into the fourth Doctor I found myself enjoying it quite a bit more. I started to enjoy it more than just feeling like I was watching it because I should, or to say that I have. 

That said - I decided if it gets progressively better I would like to continue to give the older stuff a try. ESPECIALLY seeing as how lots of the enemies and things that are popping up now have roots in the very old episodes. (I don't just mean the cybermen and the daleks.) Like these ice warriors supposedly coming up and the Great Intelligence. I'm about halfway through the first Doctor now. Reconstructions and all. It's not as enjoyable as watching the modern stuff but I think it has a certain charm to it. 

I also allow myself to admit if I'm just not interested. I will put it on and freely surf the web while listening and go back and watch when it seems like something that is important or interesting is happening. I'm still getting the information, I'm still having fun with it and who's really going to hunt me down and go ""HA! You didn't REALLY watch that episode!"" AND if somebody truly hard core does pull that, what do I care? I'm not watching these for them I'm doing it for myself and my enjoyment of the show as a whole. If I stop enjoying it, I will stop watching it. 

Anyway - those are my thoughts and experiences on what I'm doing right now watching classic Who. ",0,1365828299,null,0,false,0,c9e8tm8,t3_1c8rd1,t1_c9e8tm8,t3_1c8rd1,null,1431574169,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Not much of a pick, they're all the same company!

To OP: banks in the UK tend to be national, rather than regional as in the USA. The main high street banks in the UK are:

* RBS and Natwest (both the same company)
* HBOS, Lloyds (both the same company)
* HSBC
* Barclays
* Santander
* Co-Op Bank

The first two on that bullet list went bust during the credit crunch and were rescued by the government (which still owns a large stake in them). HSBC and Barclays managed to avoid that indignity. Santander's a relative newbie to the UK market, they're a subsidiary of a Spanish bank that's grown very aggressively by buying other financial institutions that collapsed during the credit crunch. The Co-Op Bank is a retail-only bank (no investment / merchant bank side) with an ethical policy. If any of the above is important to you, it might help you make the correct choice.

All of them are likely to have a branch within a few miles of where you live and/or work, all of them offer internet banking services, too.

Don't forget that Pride in the UK started in the 70s (as Gay Rights marches) and by the 1980s were well-established and big events.

Personally I don't think Thatcher was hugely homophobic, in fact I think like Queen Victoria she preferred to pretend it didn't exist at all. But within the wider Conservative Party it was a very big issue (just like it still is today) and because she didn't feel strongly about gay rights she had no real objections when the anti-gay side of the party managed to get Section 28 inserted into the Local Government bill.

The big irony of course is that the economic boom that occurred in the second half of the 1980s was to a large extent fuelled by young, confident city-dwellers (the first yuppies), who had far more liberal social ideas than most Tory MPs.

No no no. It was massive. There were huge demonstrations against Section 28 and it for a while it was impossible to pick up a newspaper -- broadsheet or tabloid -- without being aware of its existence. There were also a small group of protesters who broke into the BBC studios during the 6 o'clock news and got themselves on air protesting about it. It was pretty much impossible to be alive in the UK in 1988 and not be aware of Section 28 and what it was about.

1. I spend in total about £225 per week total. So you seem to be on a pretty comfortable wage. Here is a rough guide to what I have to pay in London for living expenses (GBP / week):

* Rent: 245
* Mobile: 3
* Phone line rental (need for ADSL): 8
* Internet: 7.5
* Electricity: 12.5
* Gas: 8
* Water: 4
* Council Tax: 27

Keep in mind that these rates are for two people living in a one bedroom flat in a good area of London. I'm not sure how this equates to the expense of Birmingham.


2. Public transport in England is generally awesome, for a city like Birmingham I doubt you'll have any trouble.

3. Mobile phone deals in the UK are WAY better than what I'm used to back home. I use GiffGaff which is a lesser known carrier and I pay £12 per month for unlimited internet (actually unlimited), 200UK minutes of calls and unlimited UK texts.

4. Which bank you choose really depends on what you need personally. In the UK they call transaction accounts ""current accounts""and most savings accounts are described as ""ISA"" or Internet Savings Accounts.

Anyway the UK is awesome you won't regret the move... provided you're happy to live in a land without sun.

Brummie? Expensive? Nah, I wouldn't have said so. Rent might be higher in the student areas I guess.... which applies to anywhere with a uni. Looked where Coleshill is, and it's quite a ways out of the centre, so I should imagine rental prices around there won't be too hiked up. Edgbaston was where the main uni was (my brother went there)

-I'm 22 years old so I would like to live in area with a younger community and a nice nightlife. Also I would like to easily be able to join some sort of sports team or gym.

No idea about sports teams and gyms, but seeing as Birmingham has a uni, there'll be no shortage of nightlife. Gotta keep them students drunk. 

-I plan on traveling by public transportation and by bicycle while I'm there. I assume this will not be an issue. Is biking in the rain a major inconvenience?

Depends how much you hate biking in the rain. It's not really dense rain in the UK usually, more of a shitty drizzle... so you should be OK if you've got waterproof stuff. Buses are cheap in Birmingham compared to other places from what I've seen. With it being a large town and having a uni in it, there should be frequent buses and night buses. 

-Any recommendations for cellular phone companies for a year contract or prepaid system? I'm just going to use the phone I have now and transfer carriers.

Just about every provider does pay as you go, but if you use your phone a lot, you might want to see who does monthly contracts. If you're going to be calling home, remember to check if your free credit is UK-only. All the major phone companies have their rates/contracts on their websites. We have Everything Everywhere (t-mobile and orange merged), vodafone, 3, O2, giffgaff and Lebara.

Yes you will be able to live off £1100 if thats your ""take-home"" pay. The clincher will be your rent. But you should be ok. If it doesn't conflict with your needs try looking into house/flat (apartment) sharing, helped me out and its good to have a few people who already know there way around. 

Birmingham is bristling with a young community and the nightlife is expansive. Maybe a little different to southern California, but its the second most populous city in the country there is a wide variety. There are Gyms everywhere in the city centre and around. just have a look around, they are very competitive. there are larger gym/spa complexes out of the city but they will be more expensive. 

public transport is good so no problems there, biking in the rain sucks but you'll live :P just get a good coat maybe some waterproof trousers. 

contracts tend to be two years long and any shorter they start to get very expensive and not worth it. Just buy a pay as you go sim card, stick it in your phone (check they match your phones band) O2, 3, talk-talk do really good pay as you go sims but just go into phone shops and ask what they have to offer. 

All the banks are pretty good however some are better suited to moving money around. Just go in and have a chat with them, explain your situation. I have found actual in-branch bank staff to be very helpful. 

Find a good pub

As others have said we are quite sarcastic but my american friends all seem to join in now so im sure its not a hard concept to grab. 

Tipping, you don't have to at all, infact i would be considered rude/strange. With taxis I usually round up to the nearest pound ie = taxi fare £2.50 i would hand over £3. but thats more about convenience then anything. the only other time i have tipped is at restaurants when the service has been good or im with a large group usually 10% of the total bill but again its not expected. 

People joke and are critical about the US, but if they are people of calibre then they are only joking. We love you really, we just won't say it.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"Seriously ? You're going with that ?

&gt; Not a good analogy.

&gt; We can be pretty sure that Santa does not exist because what he does defies everything we know about the laws of physics.

And a being who magically creates a planet, sun, animals and people in 6 days doesn't ?

&gt; When it comes to the existence of the universe and everything in it, and whether or not it was created by a supernatural being, things become a little more complicated.

I don't see why ? If we're sticking with the laws of physics we have, then energy can never be created nor destroyed ... in which case, it has always BEEN.

&gt; But in this case there is no way that this can be proved or disproved by any scientific means currently available.

Yes but that allows anyone to make any claim they wish, and then use the fact it cannot be disproved as *possible* evidence for it's existence. It is proof by absentia, which is nonsensical.

&gt; Atheists also relying on blind faith, believe that there is no reason why the universe shouldn't have been around forever, infinitely cycling through big bangs, for example.

That's not blind faith, that is logic. If we assume the laws of physics are constant, then a big bang / big crunch are far more likely than ""in the beginning there was nothing, and then nothing exploded"". As an atheist, I am able to observe the cyclic behaviour of everything in nature - why shouldn't the universe follow the same cyclic nature ?

&gt; Scientifically, we are still in the dark ages. And this is the really important point. We have many theories about the universe and how it works, but they are being reviewed and changed according to what our increasing technology and therefore, scientific knowledge, is revealing. But we are nowhere near being able to ascertain how it all got started, if it ever was started that is.

Yes, and while those theories may never be complete, that's still not a reason to posit ""a magic sky fairy did it"".

&gt; So in the case of the existence of God I don't think this hypothesis / null hypothesis applies. There is no way we can prove or disprove either.

See above. This agnosticism, the acceptance that we may never know 100% for sure, allows any entity to ""possibly exist"". Life is too damn short to be worrying about sock monsters or underpants gnomes.

&gt; But I'm aware that this is a belief, not a proven fact

By that logic, gravity is a ""belief"", not a proven fact. It might just be that we've never seen gravity take a day off in 13.5 billion years, and everyone floats off into space. But the *likelihood* of that happening, considering all previous experience, suggests that 99.99999999% sure is for all intents and purposes the same as 100% sure.",0,1365843602,null,0,false,0,c9eblwk,t3_1c75ld,t1_c9eblwk,t1_c9e1cqk,null,1431572785,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It is more logical to believe there is no creator, but the point is there is some logic in both beliefs, and without proof of either it is illogical to believe either.  We don't know everything and this is the real problem, we can't handle it, so we make stuff up instead.  We invent some belief system and hang onto it and try to shout down anyone that disagrees.

Ridiculing something using language like 'magic sock fairy' or 'underpants gnomes' only proves to me that you are someone who having made up your mind is now sitting there with your hands on your ears shouting ""lalalalalalalala"".  The fact that we exist gives rise to the possibility of a creator.

Trying to Compare 'that logic' to gravity is quite telling.  We can study it, measure it and see it's effects, we can posit theories about it, and then prove them by experiment, we can prove it exists and we can prove it doesn't not exist, and yet you think questioning this follows logically from questioning there is no God.  Totally illogical.

My recollection is that there was a bit of a battle going on between the traditionalists in Tory central government and the so-called ""Loony Left"" local councils.  Bear in mind that British society in the 70s and early 80s was casually sexist, racist and homophobic by today's standards.  Women were ""birds"", black people were ""darkies"" and gay people were ""benders"".  That's not to say that people necessarily were sexist, racist or homophobic at heart (although some where) but it was just more socially acceptable to use those kind of words.

The left wing were progressive in pushing for equality laws, but often got a little over-zealous in the implementation.  Positive discrimination was the obvious one (it was a running joke in the media about how black, lesbian single mothers were the most privileged class in inner cities).  The other was a bit of a tirade against any kind of language that identified anyone by gender, race, etc.  Gender-specific pronouns were out, women were ""Ms"", not ""Mrs"" or ""Miss"", and mathematics exams that talked about Jack and Jill were sexist, racist and homophobic because they didn't talk about Jacob and Kareem instead.

Needless to say, this riled the traditionalists, all stirred up by the usual hate mongers at the Daily Mail, etc.  Thatcher's speech came at a time when a lot of middle England tories, and other ""regular"" folk were starting to think that the political correctness had gone too far (which it probably had).

&gt;A majority is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements. This can be compared to a plurality, which is a subset larger than any other subset considered; i.e. a plurality is not necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's elements. In British English, majority and plurality are often used as synonyms, and the term majority is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e. the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.

true,Dudfvck,null,null,"Hello Mate, 

 I work renting houses, in the uk this is mostly done through an agent. Most high street will have lots of different letting and estate agents. Check rightmove.co.uk for properties where your are moving. Some much better than others and **please be very aware that agents who rent properties are not particularly regulated by law in UK unlike those selling houses** so some are very bad and unscrupulous other much better. Before you go looking ask collegues etc who they rent with and find out the good and bad agents first.

Keep in mind you will need to pay the first months rent upfront and a deposit and the agents fees. If you find somewhere for £600 per month, this means having to arrive in uk with a lump sum of between £1700-2000 to actually be able to rent the house. Obviously the higher the rent each month the higher the upfront payment.

Some properties will be rented privately and you will just deal with the owner. There are upsides and downsides to this but essentially if you have problems with your house, i.e heating doesn't work, and the owner isn't doing anything to remedy the situation you will have slightly more recourse with an agent rather than individual owner. Generally the rent will be cheaper though.

Now something i dont think anyone else has mentioned is an annoying catch 22 of arriving in the uk. When you try and open a bank they will want proof of address in UK. When you rent a house they want proof of an uk bank account. How to get around one without the other I don't know. See if you can open an UK account from the US with... HSBC, who I think operate in the US as well.

Final piece of advise Do not open an account with santander. I've banked with pretty much everyone in the uk at one time or another and this company are the biggest bunch of fucking muppets I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

Good Luck matey!

Edit: I forgot to say you will not have any credit history in the uk having just arrived, so wont pass a credit check. Some agents/owners will ask for a larger deposit to be held against the property, others for 6 months rent in advance. The only thing I can suggest to help you is: if you can bring a credit score from the US with you, do it. It may not get accepted but it could help (based on the assumption you have credit scoring like we do in the uk). Also it will greatly help you are arriving with work at a very well known company. If bmw bring a lot of people in from overseas, local agents will be aware, again ask colleagues who they rented with.",0,1365847814,null,0,1365848625,0,c9ec1y7,t3_1c8xqb,t1_c9ec1y7,t3_1c8xqb,null,1431572576,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

1) Bills in the UK are usually paid by direct debit, which means you give the company permission, and they take the money out of your account on an agreed date every month. If you want to pay by cheque, cash, card or bank transfer, there is usually an extra ""processing fee"" of around £2. Most people will schedule direct debits for a day or two after they get paid each month. If payday/direct debit day both fall on a weekend, don't worry, payday is usually on the last working day of the week before and direct debits are taken the first working day of the week after.

2) For your phone, you might want to check out a 30 day rolling SIM only contract. This basically means you have a one month contract which automatically renews every month unless you say otherwise.

Nobody is denying people freedom of speech, because we are offended by it. The scumbags have been allowed to celebrate on the streets of Bristol, Brixton and elsewhere and that's fine.

However the BBC is a private corporation with a duty to the public. It is not restricting your freedom of speech if they don't play a track. Just like I have the freedom of speech to set up a radio station and play tracks celebrating the death of your family members 24/7, other stations can choose not too.

I am the first one to fight against the doctrine of being offended, and how it being made illegal has ruined freedom of speech in this country, but it isn't cencorship for a company or an organisation not to facilitate your speech. You must know this.

Williams is likely on £20-30k at Swansea, which means his wage at Liverpool would be £40-60k. Signs a 4 or 5 year deal which gives you:

    (40k * 52 * 4) + 12 million / 4 years = £5M per season
    (60k * 52 * 5) + 12 million / 5 years = £5.5M per season

So a range of £5M - £5.5M per season. That puts him in the same range as Allen, and below our squad average of £7.5M per season.

12M sounds like a lot, but you have to take into account football inflation. For eg. in 2008 our turnover was £158M. Next season it will be about £250M with the new television deal. That is a 63% increase. So spending £12M on a transfer in 2013 is the equivalent of spending £4.4M on a transfer in 2007. 

To put the £4.4M figure into context, in '07 we paid £20M for Torres, £11.5M for Babel, £6M for Lucas, £6.5M for Skrtel and £17M for Mascherano. 

So Williams is cheap transfer, both in terms of football inflation and total cost compared to the squad average.

No, it is not required to prove a negative. If you insist on making claims without proof, those claims can be dismissed without proof.

&gt; Ridiculing something using language like 'magic sock fairy' or 'underpants gnomes'

As opposed to those who would accuse me of being a devil or demon or condemning me to an eternity of suffering for my *lack* of belief ? Honestly, you sound like so many theists, who having spread the word by torture and the sword for millennia, are now suddenly offended and on the back heel when people start calling them on their bullshit ?

&gt; Trying to Compare 'that logic' to gravity is quite telling. We can study it, measure it and see it's effects, we can posit theories about it, and then prove them by experiment, we can prove it exists and we can prove it doesn't not exist ...

Umm, no we cannot ""prove"" either ... we merely theorize that based on all evidence, it's behaviour is consistent and unlikely to change with a confidence very close to 1. Whereas with ""god"" we have zero evidence, and according to an agnostics logic (sic), therefore ""it might be true, but it's impossible to know"".

&gt; You want to argue with logic, and yet your argument is totally illogical.

And you want to argue for a world where anything and everything *could* exist, but we cannot know for sure. How is this any different than Santa Claus, or indeed Sock Monsters or Underpants Gnomes. Go ahead, prove they don't. We don't have any evidence either way, right ? So therefore it's a ""possibility"", it's impossible to know.

To be honest, there's so much of the Independence that's unknown, whether due to silence from the UK government refusing to consider life post-independence or bluster from Yes Scotland. There's huge wranglings over our position in the EU, NATO, our retention of the Pound/Euro, borders, currency controls, none of which are certain - Salmond this week got slapped down saying that we'd automatically join NATO and he got told no. Oil is one of those. IIRC Tony Blair shifted the maritime borders in 1999 but I do not know what effect it will have. However most projections of oil have seen put it probably 90/10 or 80/20 - yet it could all change.

Even if we do get 90/10 oil split, assuming tax intake stays the same, it would be enough to cover our current fiscal deficit without enough for a wealth fund. There is huge investment going on in the North Sea atm, but it's worth pointing out it's been in decline since 1999 and oil fields decline on average 6% p/annum after peak, while investment to get the deep oil is great, all it is doing is arresting that decline - plus the added volatility of the oil price, which could either be good (tension between Israel/Iran, increased demand from Asia etc) or bad (increased output from USA, huge new discoveries in Venezuela/Brazil/Iraq/Australia etc). TBF to the Yes Scotland campaign they've not just been putting a message about oil, it's just one that sums up the frustration many of us have in the debate - so much isn't nailed down!

So, on the one hand we're praising (nearly) all of our pivot-players while the pivot is arguably our weakest spot. 

I think Ramires is a good player against bigger teams, because he's very agressive, runs a lot,...well we know his upsides but on the other hand against clubs which only defend against us, he feels often like a liability to me. When he's under pressure he often has bad touches, sluggish passing and of course not the best vision.

true,rytlejon,lfc68,,"Nowadays it's seen as a bad thing. The normal view of the war nowadays is that the argentinean junta was under a lot of pressure and wanted a propaganda war, and that Thatcher invited the conflict to up her own poll numbers a bit. It's slightly misleading to call the invasion a ""violation of a nations sovereignity"", since by that time no one in the UK even knew those islands existed, there was (almost) no population and the Falkland islands was a colony (meaning they couldn't choose representatives to parliament etc.). Yes, you could call it a violation of a nations sovereignity but that conjures up images that would be misleading. A few points that should be made:

* Argentina did have business being on the Falklands. Juridically, it should have been handed to Argentina after the independence from Spain. By all the laws we have governing international disputes of this type (which, to be fair aren't that many and don't apply perfectly to this situation) the Falklands are Argentinean territory, occupied by the British. (Source: professor in international law from Geneva whose lecture on the subject I visited a couple of weeks ago, I can't be more precise than that.)
* The UN has demanded (several times) that the UK and Argentina sit down and negotiate over who has the right to the islands. The UK has refused.
* The laws invoked by the British is a UN-resolution called something like ""the right to self-determination"" which basically says you're allowed to choose which country you belong to. This is problematic since the UK protested that law when it came to be (during the de-colonization process somewhere round the 50-60's), since it would allow british colonies to break free, and they've protested the use of the law several times (Hong Kong for example, wasn't allowed to vote to become chinese). The law was made for indigineous populations to be able to break free from colonial oppression. Applying it on a population that was basically moved to the islands to maintain colonial oppression is a perverted use of that law, you could say.
* The UK has tried to invade Argentina 2-3 times (depending on how you count) and there is a strong feeling that the only reason that the war was started from the british side was to show military force and to strengthen the image of the strong colonial power (and the image of Thatcher in the press).
* The war wasn't ""clean"" from the UK side. Not from the Argentinean side either. However, two wrongs don't make a right. One especially controversial move was [sinking the ARA Belgrano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_General_Belgrano#Controversy_over_the_sinking) 

I just wanted to add a bit of nuance to what I felt was too a simplistic view of the war.

TL;DR: The falkland war is a complicated issue. However, a lot of things suggest that the war was used by Thatcher to up her own image that was struggling in the UK.",1,1365856208,null,0,false,0,c9ecyq7,t3_1c8qou,t1_c9ecyq7,t1_c9eavyo,null,1431572147,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

- We have dealt with A LOT of injuries; against Everton we had 5 starters/probable starters injured; Sandro, Kaboul, Lennon, Bale, Defoe. That's nearly half our starting lineup

- We are learning a new system of football, and putting together a team of players for a new manager. I think this has been understated. Gylfi was effectively out the first half of the year while he learned a new position (winger) and almost everyone had to adjust to a new style of play; We've loaned out players like Kane, Townsend, and Obika who could potentially have helped us on this run, ostensibly so AVB could see them get Senior game time.

- we've been very very cautious &amp; patient in the transfer market. I know this is a Daniel Levy thing anyways, but I think that neither he not AVB sees this season as critical; they're taking the long-term view, which is the correct decision.

- finally, the Bale question. Yes, he's a world class player, we would be &amp; are unquestionably a different side without him. But Levy isn't going to sell him for cheap and I can't see Bale forcing a move, even if he hands In a transfer request, which I can't see him doing.

I didn't mean to question the *existence* of ""ethnomathematics"", just that only ignorant people (like my mum) talk about things they don't understand. 

I haven't parsed that wikipedia page fully, but ""anti-racist mathematics"" appears to be things like saying ""Jamal has 10 japatis"" instead of ""Sean has 10 potatoes"" and also teaching that Pythagoras' theorem was also discovered independently in India and China, possibly before that greek guy was even born. 

I appreciate it may not be obvious, but if you don't understand why these things are important and valuable then please just say, because I'll be glad to explain.

The point is that teaching mathematics in a way that's inclusive is *certainly and provably a good thing*, but these words ""anti-racist mathematics"" probably sounded ridiculous to a grocer's daughter from Lincolnshire, so Thatcher dismissed the idea without learning about it.

Or, considering she was a graduate, maybe she just wanted to score political points with the ordinary people who would think it ridiculous, so she used this divisive soundbite politically, at the expense of little immigrant kids learning maths in middle school. 

I don't really buy the idea that good teaching is expensive. You only need to send one teacher on this training course, if you do so on the basis that he (or she) will evangelise to his colleagues and share books with them to read, so they can become better informed.

At today's prices I'd guess you might pay £30 an hour for a supply teacher (including the cost of the agency, holiday, sick &amp; maternity pay) which would pay for 5 or 6 textbooks - so a 40 or 50 textbooks can be bought for the cost of a single day's teaching. Those books will last 4 or 5 years and may be used by hundreds of kids.  ",0,1365856812,null,0,false,0,c9ed1oj,t3_1c7hpe,t1_c9ed1oj,t1_c9ec1pd,null,1431572107,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Legally speaking your contract is with whoever you pay so the venue would be liable even if it was the fault of the promoter. Same principle applies with goods, the retailer is liable for faulty goods even if it's fault of the manufacturer.

A note on Council Tax (or why I'm being a pedant): Council Tax is paid to the local authority based mainly on the value of your property. In return the council provide services like rubbish collection and street lighting amongst others. The rate you pay and the services you receive depend on which council your property falls under. Coleshill comes under North Warwickshire Council whereas Castle Bromwich is either Solihull or Birmingham depending on which part. Here's a [list](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/popularcouncilservices) of popular Birmingham City Council services.

**here ends pedantry**

You'll be fine for rent as long as you don't stretch yourself. I've no experience in renting houses but try sites like rightmove or Zoopla. I'm not sure on estate agents (what we call realtors iirc), some of my friends have used *Paul Carr* without any problems but they were buying rather than renting. 

Tenancy agreements rarely contain anything included so you'll have to pay for council tax, utilities, internet and pretty much any other service you can think of. I cannot stress how important it is to read the tenancy agreement (and any other contract you get) in full and make sure you understand it. I believe it's a legal right in the UK to take a contract home overnight to peruse at your leisure.

Castle Bromwich is quite close to Hams Hall (where is where BMW are) and gets a decent bus service (the 94 into town) as well as being close enough to cycle although I'm not 100% on how nice the area is but I don't think it's as bad as it used to be. 

Water Orton and Coleshill itself may be out of your price range but it's always worth a look and parts of Erdington may be fine if a little far away for unsociable hours. Minworth is another place with a decent reputation but again may be pricey. Castle Vale wouldn't be bad but still has a reputation lasting from the 80s of being a bit rough.

&gt;I'm 22 years old so I would like to live in area with a younger community and a nice nightlife. Also I would like to easily be able to join some sort of sports team or gym.

If you can get to Birmingham City Centre you'll be fine for nightlife. Sports teams may be a bit tougher and you'll probably be stuck with football (soccer), rugby or cricket. I know there is a gym in Chelmsley Wood [fwfitness](http://www.fwfitness.co.uk/) that some family go to and they say it's good but I don't go so no personal recommendations from me.

&gt;I plan on traveling by public transportation and by bicycle while I'm there. I assume this will not be an issue. Is biking in the rain a major inconvenience?

It doesn't rain that often and cycling in the rain is fine. I would mention being aware of other road users and pedestrians if you travel on the paths. Public transport is good but the number 90 (which runs closest to Hams Hall) is half hourly during the day. For public transport timetables and tickets in the West Midlands I suggest the [centro [they oversee public transport in the West Midlands] website](http://jp.networkwestmidlands.com/centro/XSLT_SELTT_REQUEST?language=en).

Obviously the availability of public transport depends on where you live. The rail system around Birmingham is classic wheel and spoke so to cross the north of the city you're obliged to go into the centre and come back out again so unless you live close to Coleshill Parkway or Water Orton railway stations you'll be reliant on the bus or cycling. 

As for buses running to/from the city centre The 67 runs to Castle Vale via Aston and the Tyburn Road (covering parts of Erdington). The 904/902 runs to Sutton Coldfield (often abbreviated to Sutton here) via the main part of Erdington and Wylde Green (the latter is another decent area but probably too far to cycle). The 94 runs to Chelmsley Wood although only to the Clock Garage late at night.

-Any recommendations for cellular phone companies for a year contract or prepaid system? I'm just going to use the phone I have now and transfer carriers.

You're practically stuck with Pay as you go (PAYG) to be honest (ie prepaid) as your credit rating in this country probably isn't very good. The good news is though that you can get PAYG that basically gives you the same stuff a contract does if you top up £X per month. 

Your signal should be fine whoever you go with. I am with O2 and have had no problems getting signal off them (I had an interview in Coleshill once). Same with Vodafone although I prefer O2. As long as you make sure your phone is unlocked you can always try out various operators.

-What is a good bank to use?

Others have covered this pretty well.

Some other things:

* We don't like to talk on public transport
* Avoid religion or politics unless asked - both are personal matters here
* Cost of living is usually higher in the UK (but £1100 pcm should be fine)
* Local cafes do good breakfasts for a decent price - look for independent stores usually with a blackboard outside. Using these you can get a cup of tea for under £1 or a full English for £3-4.
* Fish and Chip shops are wonderful. John's (not to be confused with Big John's) is a good chippy at the edge of town by the law courts. Atlantis is nice on Wylde Green high street.
* All the major supermarkets deliver for a small fee (or free above a certain value)
* Tipping is not expected and not mandatory but it's not offensive if you do tip for good service - usually for cab drivers or waiters in posh restaurants
* When it comes to food try faggots, bacon, chips, meat pie and treacle pudding as a minimum.
* It may take a while to get our sense of humour


**tl;dr - £1,100 is fine as long as you don't go OTT. For public transport look at bus times**

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"You have listed a lot of points, but I think they're all explainable:

1) Scotland's position in the EU is fairly straightforward. It is inarguably part of the EU at present, as is England (via the UK). As such Scottish and English Law is already compatible with the EU, and so there are unlikely to be any practical difficulties in converting Scotland into a member nor any real benefit to Scotland, rUK, or the EU to eject it.

As such Scotland would almost certainly remain in the UK until negotiations with the EU had concluded, and secede from the UK and accede to the EU on the same date. It is true that the UK government is [refusing to consider](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html) that process ahead of the referendum, and it's possible that the Conservative's plans for an EU-withdrawal referendum may complicate things, but if the EU can manage a process like the reunification of Germany it seems unlikely that Scotland will pose any real difficulty.

2) NATO. The SNP plan to join NATO, although there is a question over if that would be automatic or not. Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives are also in favour of NATO, so even if they won the post-referendum Scottish parliamentary election the Scottish Government, whoever it is, would be in favour of joining.

As with the EU there is no real reason why this could not be handled on the same day of seceding from the UK; given NATO's use of locations such as Cape Wrath for massive exercises such as Joint Warrior, it seems likely that other NATO countries would have nothing to gain by refusing membership.

Technically NATO membership requires members to participate in the ""nuclear umbrella"" program, which seems at odds with the SNP's plans to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland. Practically speaking there is almost zero likelihood that weapons would be placed in Scotland (NATO has around 180 bombs that can be dropped from aircraft, so unlike Trident there's no advantage to siting them in Scotland vs central Europe), the five countries that currently host these weapons are trying to reduce them, and it is not even clear if the nuclear umbrella program is in violation of the NPT (the US maintains it is not, since the weapons still belong to them until such time as war is declared - at which point the NPT is void; that seems a little disingenuous).

3) Retention of the pound (not Euro) seems uncontroversial. The Bank of England (the national bank for the UK, despite the name) would control the money supply and interest rates, however neither of those are likely to pose a problem. Scotland and rUK's economies will remain closely interlinked for some time, and very similar in character, so the idea that the BoE could (or even would) take some action that would adversely affect Scotland without also affecting rUK seems implausible.

The most likely change, IMO, is that Scotland and rUK would enter the Euro at some date - if it survives its current crisis, a Euro in 20-50 years time may well be a better choice than Sterling.

Technically speaking, new states are required to adopt the Euro. Sweden is [one such state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_and_the_euro), however there is no real pressure for them to do so and it seems unlikely that Scotland would fare any differently.

4) Scotland would remain part of the [Common Travel Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area), which allows free movement within the British Isles.

Technically new state are required to adopt Schengen as part of the EU's commitment to freedom of movement, however this is one of the areas that the UK has acquired an opt-out for. Scotland will probably obtain the same concession - it would be of no benefit to any of the three parties to do things differently.

5) I think ""currency controls"" is really the same as #3, i.e., the BoE would control the money supply. The SNP have floated the idea that Scotland should retain a permanent seat on the MPC, which is not entirely without merit. Scottish taxpayers have contributed to around 1/8th of the UK's national assets, of which entities like the BoE would be one - and, as before, what's good for Scotland is likely to be good for England too.

6) The oil division is [already settled](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1c9itl/how_does_scotland_plan_to_stand_on_its_own_2_feet/c9eczyy), in so far as such things can be. There is no real grounds for declaring that part of the water that falls within Scotland's boundaries now belongs to rUK any more than there would be for Scotland to declare that the Lake District now belongs to it.

In terms of how oil contributes to Scotland, a good country to look at is somewhere like Denmark. They do not have Norway's massive oil fund (Norway are something of a special case, since they have been particularly rigorous about saving a small %ge rather than spending: the UK has simply spent the revenue), and expect their oil to run out in 2050.

That does not mean that Denmark is about to become a failed state, it simply means they have to ensure their economy is diverse enough to cope. Scotland would be in a similar position - oil revenue is currently around 18% of public sector revenue, and new sources of revenue would need to be found (it's worth remembering that food/drink exports and tourism actually generate the same amount of money in the private sector as oil).

One example might be electricity; Scotland currently exports around 26% of the electricity generated here to the rest of the UK, and generates 39% of its electricity from renewables. The target is that 100% of electricity will come from renewables by 2020, which seems quite achievable - and exports are likely to rise accordingly/",0,1365858257,null,0,false,0,c9ed9ab,t3_1c9itl,t1_c9ed9ab,t1_c9ecm2g,null,1431572008,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

It wasn't okay for one or two textbook questions to refer to non-English names... every question did it. The pictures in every book were practically obliged to have a white, black and asian student in them.

If anything, all it did was remind us at every page that we were different, but forced to get along by this new entity called 'political correctness'. It created distinctions where none actually existed. i.e. a name stopped being just a name, and became some sort of political statement about multiculturalism.

She is mocking the notion that in order for all children to relate to a fictional character in a text book question, it must share the same name or skin colour as them.

1) I think you are underestimating the problems with a EU membership. No such precedent exists in law, be it English Scottish or within the EU. In personal capacities EU commissioners have expressed doubts that Scotland's accession would be uninterrupted and questioned those (graham avery) who have asserted this. Scotland would certainly face opposition from within the EU, notably Spain but most likely France or Italy, if independence was accepted with all of the benefits and opt-outs Britain enjoys. And if Scotland was considered a new nation - as has been implied though is not certain - the quickest time expected would be about 3 years with all the negotiation that entails. As such I think you're underplaying the difficulties that would exist. Moreover there the irony of wishing to remain in the EU and NATO while opting out of the union. To me it doesn't make sense.

2) again I agree Scotland would join NATO, though the debate recently has implied this would cause more faff.

3) I disagree here. The yes campaign have proposed a radically choose defence budget and wish to enshrine welfare and education spending in a constitution. This will make Scotland's parliamentary system far less flexible than the uk's where parliamentary decisions will be more easily overridden. If you see some of the debates that expose gaps between uk and Scotland they are over economic issues - welfare spending. Then there's the fact that for businesses to be won over, they are going to need incentives like lower corporation tax. Whether that happens or not the fact is that post-independence Scotland will be economically different - I've heard rumours there will be a substantial contraction in financial services and some areas of manufacturing. Independence will mean a huge rebalancing of the economy and pegging Scotland's economy to the bank of England could be severely detrimental.

I don't think without substantial political reform the uk will join the euro either

4) this goes back to 1) - we don't know exactly what will happen and I think that other EU nations would be keen to impose schengen to warn their own independent movements that secceeding would not bring benefits 

5) if Scotland becomes independent I don't think this is a bad idea; I do think though there will be little appetite for it. If Scotland is independent that means independence and not being involved in trying to influence the Bank of England. Id we want to do that surely union is better?

6) I think the importance of oil has been overstated yet it will still be a sixth of the economy. And the price is volatile - it went from
$130/barrel to $88/barrel in 2 months last year! That makes budgetary planning much more volatile and difficult to predict - in comparison oil is about 2% of the uk's economy!

My mum worked on privatising the uk energy network. She thinks (and this is only anecdotal) that it would be cheaper for the uk to import French nuclear or gas through the uk/Belgium pipe than Scottish renewables, as they had and I think still have the highest tariffs. If however there's a substantial decline in uk generating capacity then I suppose they could be essential

* £1100 is sufficient. I don't think Brum is that expensive, but it is creeping up, and rent in the centre will run from £600 and up for your own place. I would suggest looking for a flatshare, too. With the universities there, you could probably find an affordable room and it'd be a great way to get to know people.
* In regards to utilities, we spent roughly £150 a month and had gas heating. This does not include council tax. Groceries, for two, averaged around £100 a week; however, to put that in perspective, that included always having alcohol in the house, soda, crisps, snacks, in general: a very well-stocked pantry. We lived right by Brindley Place, so we went out quite a bit, too. Drinks along Broad Street will range around £4-6 for a cocktail and around £2.50-£4 for a beer. Of course, different night's have different offers.
* Broad Street is the big nightlife street, along with the Arcadian, Gas Street Basin, the Mailbox (GSB goes that way), and by the Pagoda Island (near the front of the Mailbox featuring Island Bar and the Victoria). Student and younger areas tend to be Kings Heath, Selly Oak, Moseley, Digbeth, Bear Wood, and parts of Ladywood. I'd avoid Aston, Sparkhill, and and Sparkbrook. What sports team are you looking for? As for Gyms, there are a few to pick from. Pure Gym is pretty popular, cheap and cheerful - no pool, though.
* Whatever you do do not use O2. Absolutely horrible. I would rather get a fax machine and beeper than use O2 again.
* We banked with HSBC and Natwest and they were both surprisingly good. A lot of people hate HSBC, so. My boyfriend has been banking with them since a teen, so: hey, that's him, but he never had a problem and they were really helpful in our transition abroad.

I loved Birmingham and would move back in a heartbeat. It's a great city and the people are incredibly friendly. I'd definitely recommend checking out the Wellington, Bodega, Island Bar, and Get Stuffed (the burrito stand on Broad Street, I am convinced they add heroin or something to them because over a year later I still crave them). The weather while I was there was really mild with a long warm summer and not an awful lot of rain, so I wouldn't stress too much about that. Biking is okay, but not an awful lot of paths I noticed, but there is some excellent biking trails in Sutton Park and surrounding areas if you like MTB.

Feel free to PM me for anything else and definitely hit up /r/brum, too. Great group of people :)",0,1365864323,null,0,1365877888,0,c9eefba,t3_1c8xqb,t1_c9eefba,t3_1c8xqb,null,1431571458,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

Considering their performances this season, alarm bells should ring here which is why I said a young striker is needed.

There is no such thing as objective tastelessness, all 'taste' is subjective, so the BBC can't just pick and choose and has to represent the views of its listeners.

This is essentially an abuse of press freedom. And I'm not sure whether some abuses of freedom are worse than others. I think you have to look at the intention behind it. Obviously, anti terror laws and stuff are worse than the BBC not playing this song, but their general intention (stopping terrorism) is far better.
When you think about the effect that Thatcher had on this country, surely you can recognise that this is not just an issue of whether they play an offensive song. It's whether history is written as thatcher being good or evil. All week the right wing press have been vilifying any attempt to criticise Thatcher because its 'disrespectful'.

Imagine holding a piece of chalk, but the chalk is colored. Rather than being chalky in the sense that it dissolves into a dry, powdery substance, pastel is ever-so-slightly moist/oily, so that the artist can put the pastel on the paper (or whatever he or she is using) and then use some sort of tool (usually his or her hands) to blend the colors together, creating deeply rich color variants that resemble oil paintings. 

Most people who begin experimenting with art will start with pastels because they're so much fun to work with and don't require knowledge of brush technique to use, but really, they are an incredibly difficult medium to use effectively.

£1100 is doable definitely, you'll have to budget for tax  and I'd recommend getting a house/flat share if you can to drastically cut costs (advice I really should have taken myself).

You'll also be in between Manchester, Cardiff and London, so you have the opportunity to see some amazing cities. 
For your phone, get it unlocked and use a pay as you go sim. Providing you turn off the internet it'll not cost you much. 
Google council tax for the area you're looking at (there are different tax bands depending on house value too), water costs. Gas and electricity you can control yourself by being frugal.

We did not look like we wanted that game.  We may have had a lot of shots, a lot of attacks, and forced a lot of great saves, but I never got the sense that we *wanted* the game.  We never went for the jugular.  It's that killer instinct that sets Man United apart from teams like us- you can bet your ass if it had been Man U out there today they'd have put five past Reading and still pushed for more.

The lack of runs, the low level of urgency of the runs that did occur, the poor decision making, the unwillingness to press/track back and win the ball all contributed to us not being able to find the back of the fucking net.

Suarez, Sturridge, take a seat.  You two exemplified the poor decision making, on and off the ball, that got me frothing at the mouth.  Glen, you were not good either on the ball, though I give you credit on defense at least.  Same goes for Jose.

Coutinho, you were good, now let's work on the accuracy of those shots a little more.

Agger and Carra, no complaints, great game by Carra.

Gerrard and Lucas were all right, aside from giving away some silly fouls.  Gerrard looked a real threat at times and had some hard-hit shots along with some great passes.

Hendo, I have no clue why you were taken off, you were pretty damn great when you were on.  Good passing, nice goal threat, good running, good covering and tackling.  Hold your head high.

Downing was all right.

**MOTM- Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of god**, for taking possession of ~~Mick~~ ^^wtf ^^brain Alex McCarthy's body and making some miraculous saves.  Jesus saves.

I can use a preview screen to zoom in on things i couldn't otherwise see, a telescopic lens helps too.

Remember Doctor Who? No, nor does any one else. They had one of the most popular shows on TV, then they put a guy in charge who is so far up his own ass he is destroying the show. Instead of 1 series a year and a Christmas special we're lucky if we get a handful of episodes and a random Christmas story with the Doctor playing a supporting role. 

Even the comedy has gone to shit. Except Russel Howard I can't think of a single good comedian left on the BBC. Dave started to pay real money and scalped everyone worth a damn. So instead of the BBC fighting back and making some good content, they make tired out dated 90s sitcoms about a ""slightly awkward"" person with a snarky personality, where half the time the joke is looking at the camera and pulling a silly face.

It's the same as adverts not having to be shit. Companies take the brute force approach to marketing. Sling shit at the mark twice every fifteen minutes and something's bound to stick (I just LOVE seeing the same ad twice in a row!!!).

So the options are;

* Have an ad break
* Product placement
* License fee

I'd say the license fee is the least appealing. Ad breaks would be best from my personal perspective because I would record whatever I want to watch and then not watch the ads, given that the ability to do this is mainstream the only reasonable compromise for me is product placement.

I don't mind it that much tbh and I'm sure the 'art' will develop to become much for subtle and therefore effective.

Finally... I would say look at the output from a company like HBO compared to BBC or ITV. Unfortunately there's not a huge amount of craft left in either the BBC or ITV, as far as my choice in programming goes. You may disagree and I would never argue with someone's personal choice. Just saying the license fee isn't good. Not picking a fight with you as I appreciate you said ads on ITV would be better.

Isn't it great that we can choose to watch the content, funded in the manner that we want (bar the BBC).

Agger played well with the little he had to do but the best non-god player on the pitch was Coutinho for me. Had some great efforts and played some really good through balls.

Still not convinced that JLC is a great actress. In her scenes with David Warner, I found her to be especially unnatural, particularly because Warner did very well with this character. She has great chemistry with Matt Smith, though, even though they rely on romantic undertones quite heavily.

Right, the promoter has promised you a full crowd, so you get all of the workers in before the punters arrive. You have a full cellar and stocked shelves and you estimate sales and the nightly take. 

Then it turns out to be a totally lame night two hours in and you know it's not going to get any better so you make the decision to shut the club early, cancel the late DJ's, send the barstaff home, send the doorstaff home and go home yourself. Maybe have a little drink yourself, who knows. 

So yes, you've saved on staff wages, but you've also lost out on ""estimated"" sales and door take. In our club the promoter took a % of the door, we took the bar and paid the DJ's, it's just how it worked.  Also in a student venue you then have to go to the higher ups in the University and explain to them why the take is drastically down. 

So yes, it's lost revenue.

I really feel for Ben Cooper. I believe he has made this choice in the interest of decency and respect, something that is still critical in running a radio station. Being a BBC station doesn't negate that fact. He has to find middle ground between playing the full song and upsetting people who believe that it's just not appropriate (myself included), and not playing it and pissing off... well, people in this thread and others around the UK. Just because it's a BBC station does not mean that they are unable to make editorially justified choices. For example, when 4'33 charted in 2010, BBCR1 didn't play the whole track, yet I recall no such outrage from the general public like there is in this instance. Why? Aren't we arguing the same point, really? 

I don't really know who I am trying to convince here, perhaps nobody, but the overall reaction to this song not getting played frustrates me a bit. I wasn't born in the Thatcher era, so maybe I don't feel so strongly about why people bought this song. On another note, I'd be willing to bet most of those so angry about BBCR1 not playing this song aren't even in the target audience (15-24) for BBCR1.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"1) There is no precedent; however there was no precedent for the re-unification of Germany either, or the current Eurozone crisis. The EU is nothing if not flexible, and if ultimately the goal is to have Scotland in the EU (which I don't think anyone seriously doubts) then there is no real reason a way could not be found.

The situation with Spain is frequently misunderstood: the argument is that since they are opposed to Catalonian independence (and EU membership), they would also be opposed to Scotland. Spain's objection to Catalonia is due to the Spanish constitution - this is based on the ""undissolvable unity of the Spanish nation"" (and stems from their civil war). As such, the Spanish government thinks what the Catalonian government is proposing is quite literally illegal. There is no real objection to a negotiated settlement of the type that Scotland/rUK would have.

I doubt very much that Scotland would either want, or expect, all of the opt-outs that the UK enjoys. Euro membership could be deferred as per Sweden (so does not require an opt-out), and given that Ireland and UK have both opted out of Schengen I don't see any real objection to continuing that. Opt-outs are not [unique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union), but they are quite rare - and narrow in scope.

The timescale is certainly undefined, although this is not helped by the UK government's [refusal to discuss it](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html). Personally I would not be particularly bothered even if it took 5 years (although given that Scottish law is already compliant with EU law, and adjusting national law to be in compliance is often the stumbling block when joining, a long delay seems unlikely).

I don't see any particular irony in wishing to leave the UK while remaining in the EU; the EU is obviously dominated by France/Germany/UK, but IMO it tries to ensure the voices of small countries are still heard.

At present Scotland's voice within the EU is 8% of a much larger voice - within the EU we would have less power, but our own voice. That the UK government is Scotland's only representation within the EU, yet are refusing to follow up the EC's offer of discussing the referendum, is a good example of how that is not working.

3) I thought was about currency, but… I believe the SNP are currently proposing spending £2.5bn on defence? Scotland currently contributes about £3bn to the MoD's budget, and receives £2bn, so it would appear that Scotland would spend less yet receive more under those circumstances (perhaps this isn't what you meant by ""radically choose""?).

In terms of a written constitution, [most countries have them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_constitutions) (the UK is relatively unusual - it shares the stage with Israel and Saudi Arabia). As for what goes into it, that is still up for a discussion (the discussion would be entirely cross-party, according to the SNP: I assume Scottish Labour/Conservatives would eventually take part, even though they are refusing to discuss it at present). Personally I would include free education (I assume that's what you mean by spending?), but not elements like homelessness. Other people have other opinions.

Future generations will certainly think differently to today, written constitution or not. As in the US, they would be free to amend it - but as in the US, it would help set the cultural norms that we (all) think are appropriate.

Scotland currently spends proportionately less on public sector expenditure (which includes welfare) than the UK as a whole: in 2012 Scotland spent 42.7% of its GDP on public sector expenditure, vs 45.5% for the UK (GERS 2011-12, page 22). The SNP have long planned to lower corporation tax to below that of the UK, although it looks like the Conservatives will lower it to that level first. Rumours of ""substantial contractions"" are hard to evaluate without a little more information.

By ""pegging Scotland's economy to the BoE"", do you mean interest rates? Obviously the economy as a whole would have no direct link to the BoE. I do not think it's likely the BoE will increase interest rates to a point that causes Scotland issues without also causing issues for rUK (the UK receiving a signifiant downgrade in credit rating, leading to a run on the pound, seems to me to be a larger danger - but no riskier than any other choice).

4) It is quite true that we ""don't know exactly what will happen"". But that is true of everything - do you know exactly what will happen with the UK's relationship to the EU in the future? Will the Conservatives call their in-or-out referendum? What will the result be? Will France/Germany have enough of the UK's semi-hostile attitude and relegate us to an outer tier? Who knows: those are all uncertain too.

5) There may not be political appetite for Scottish representation, but the BoE is legally required to be independent of UK government policy. Its mandate is to manage inflation. They may well decide that it makes sense, given that the two economies will have some linkage for some time, to enter into a temporary (5-10 years) arrangement with the Scottish government. I see lots of ways that Scotland and rUK could work together for mutual benefit - IMO the risk of scorched-earth type policies is greatly overplayed.

6) Oil would be 18% of public sector revenue: that is not ""the economy"" (in absolute terms, it is £10bn: the same as food/drink exports and tourism). The price is indeed volatile, however it would be contributing to a nation of 5 million rather than 60 million.

So far I see no real signs that the SNP are ""banking everything on oil"", if anything they are being much more guarded about it than the independence campaign of the '70s. Everyone knows oil is a finite resource, but the idea that Scotland could only be independent during that 100 year window when it's available does not seem plausible.

It may well be cheaper for the UK to import coal/gas than to buy electricity directly from Scotland. On the other hand Scotland is very likely to achieve its target of 100% of electricity coming from renewables by 2020, at which point it may be able to offer it more cheaply (not to mention it would simply be electricity, thus allowing rUK more headroom to meet their CO2 obligations).

Or perhaps there will be an interconnect cable to distribute electricity to mainland Europe? That sounds quite ambitious, but Iceland are currently investigating [exactly that](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/11/iceland-volcano-green-power).

Independence has a lot to offer Scotland - and I think it would also be good for rUK. The future is quite exciting, I think.",0,1365880245,null,0,false,0,c9eiyik,t3_1c9itl,t1_c9eiyik,t1_c9eednd,null,1431569249,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

If you are a respected public figure, who claims that his beliefs are based on reason, science and research, and you often make a statement as strong as ""Islam [is the] greatest force for evil today”, you should really have put the time in to make this distinction.

Also, the Nazism thing is a complete straw man. Nazism isn't a religion that derives all its practices from a core text, such that you can distinguish between what is and is not part of nazism by reading that text.

That is assuming the final figure ended up as 8% of course; ownership of national assets (those paid for by every UK taxpayer) would also be divided by 8%, so less debt may be taken if more assets remain with rUK (or vice versa).

However [Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt) the UK debt is £1,347.4 billion and interest payments are £43bn. So assuming an 8% split, Scotland would have an initial debt of £108bn and interest payments of £3bn.

Unfortunately, the meaning of the core scriptures are subject to the interpretation by nutters. This is where it all falls apart. Islam is not the ""book"", it's the interpretation of the book ... by trying to separate the book and it's adherents, you're just introducing a ""no true Scotsman fallacy"" into the equation to try and excuse the behaviour.

And in any case, as someone who *has* read the Koran, and the Bible, and the Torah, they all contain a large amount of horrible, misogynistic, atrocious life lessons that have NO bearing whatsoever on modern life. So it's the case with ALL religions, you will claim it's peaceable and good, while cherry picking to avoid all the nasty shit that's in there also. If you follow the ""core scriptures"" as you call them, we could all own slaves, sleep with 7 year-olds and allow rapists to buy their way out of jail with 50 pieces of silver (just so you understand I'm not condemning *just* Islam, but all Abrahamic religions equally).

&gt; Also, the Nazism thing is a complete straw man. Nazism isn't a religion ...

I'm from Ireland and they have probably have even heard of that only 50/50 and have no idea where or what it is ('it's near England' I say grudgingly.) 

For that matter most Cambodians don't seem to know anything about France, their former colonial master, never mind anywhere else in Europe. In fact some aren't that hot even on 'Europe' and don't know where *that* is.

He has played at LM and CB in the past, so he is also more flexible positionally.

He's under-rated and under-valued because he plays in Russia, whereas the opposite is true of Baines because he's English. If Transfermarkt is accurate then selling Benny and getting Criscito would only have a net cost of £3m, as opposed to Baines who they reckon would cost us £8.5m net.

* Renting out multiple individual rooms is often more lucrative than renting out the whole flat/house.

The above two points have already been covered by /u/Hammyman and /u/Girlwithnousername.

* Full time students are exempt from paying Council Tax - while the tenant is usually liable for Council Tax (depending on the terms of the lease), it's far from unheard of for the landlord to be pursued for payment if it's not paid.

* Students are far often less discerning about the quality of the fittings and furniture.

* Students rarely want to end their tenancy before the lease comes to its end, and come September, there's a whole new group of students looking for somewhere to live.

* Often only students *want* to live in certain areas - this is self-perpetuating, the more students move into an area, the fewer working people want to live there - landlords do not want to be blamed for the noise and other nuisances that are associated with living in an area popular with students, nor for their tenants to move out early because of this.

There are also landlords who will only rent to people with a job, no students or housing benefit.  It depends on what the landlord is looking for in a tenant.  Not all landlords/letting agencies will reject non-students, but some will.  If you're only seeing student lets, I'd advise looking in a different area.

Yes, but as I've said, that's all down to *interpretation*. Two Imans read the same thing from the book, and make two completely *different* interpretations of it. And because their interpretation IS the immutable word of Allah, it cannot be contradicted, despite the fact they indeed contradict each other !

This is a wonderful get-out clause that allows atrocities to take place according to ONE interpretation, and those who choose to interpret if DIFFERENTLY to stand idly by and do nothing for fear of contradicting Allah himself.

&gt; But anyway, if you are condemning all Abrahamic religions equally then I have no beef with you.

They're all founded on the same myths, legends, traditions of a people spending too much time in the hot sun, whatever you want to call them. Judaism was the original, Christianity was the sequel that many argued wasn't as good as the original ... and Islam is the reboot that lasted for one season until Fox cancelled it.

&gt; I don't like this current anti-Islam trend, that acts as if Islam is evil and Christianity is peachy.

Christianity has a good 700 years head start, and only grew out of their witch-burning phase just recently. Islam is still the rebellious teenager with an axe to grind, and we can only hope in another 500 years, they are reduced to baking muffins ans holding bring-and-buy sales also.

true,tizz66,eng-essex,Essex,"I'm afraid not. Some of the reasons:

- They can drive innovation because they are not beholden to advertising money. iPlayer is a great example of this. They dedicated a lot of resources to streaming before anyone else had cracked it and before the concept was entirely proven. It's now the standard that others aim to match. Their expertise filters through the industry via groups like YouView. I accept Sky also has success in innovation. Virgin and ITV... not so much.

- They drive adoption of new technologies, such as digital TV. Would ITV have been able to spend millions educating the public about the switchover? Unlikely.

- They provide competition for commercial broadcasters. This is important, because by having a non-commercial competitor, the others need to meet a certain standard if anyone is going to watch their channels. We have some of the best TV in the world, in no small part thanks to the BBC. Even if it isn't shown on the BBC channels, the underlying influence is there.

- They show content that commercial broadcasters simply wouldn't bother touching because it doesn't make money. Be it educational, cultural, scientific or religious programming, the BBC makes and broadcasts shows that would otherwise go unmade in the UK. Would ITV put on weeks of classical music like the Proms (excluding Last Night, which has a large audience)?

- _We_ are their 'shareholders'. This means they can do things for our own good that shareholders of a commercial broadcaster wouldn't necessarily take a risk on because it doesn't provide a good return. I come back to iPlayer. Streaming is _expensive_ - would commercial broadcasters have bothered if iPlayer hadn't built the interest? Few channels in the US, for example, stream online, because there is little profit in it and they're tied up in cable company contracts.

- They stand out as one of, if not _the_, leading broadcasters in the world. How much value this provides to the country as a whole is possibly up for argument, but I believe it's very valuable. Our broadcasting industry is iconic and extremely well respected - and it's not because of ITV, trust me. BBC World Service goes along with this too, providing news in parts of the world where domestic news sources are unavailable or otherwise tainted. (The BBC World Service is funded differently, but it is still part of the BBC).

- They put on free cultural events that would likely not exist or be accessible to all otherwise. See: proms, electric proms, radio 1 events and more.  

Put it this way. Without the BBC being a publicly funded institution (however that funding might occur), we would not be very far away from a US-like broadcast industry, where money and viewing figures dictate everything to almost absurd levels. ITV and Sky provide a decent service, but they are not replacements for the BBC.",0,1365886012,null,0,1365887039,0,c9eknzf,t3_1c9g6f,t1_c9eknzf,t1_c9egtlf,null,1431568445,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That is, of course, the only reasonable position.

Note that what the Qur'an has to say on the issue is [here](http://quran.com/4/89-90). It says kill apostates who are fighting against you, but not those who aren't.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I don't think that this is a product of Americanization, if anything this is a product of a British practice that fell into disuse by Americans long ago.

I'm referring to the writer's room, or rather, the lack thereof. 

You see, on British television it's exceedingly common *not* to use a writer's room and just have individual authors make separate scripts that then get pulled through by a script editor and polished into a final product.

This is flawed for a number of reasons, and is specifically exacerbated by Moffat's ""close to the vest"" style. 

In America, the writer's room is an extraordinary boon, especially considering our traditionally longer seasons (about 25 compared to Who's 13). This allows writers to work collaboratively, as a team. In this way, the writing becomes more consistent, the characters get more fleshed out, and in general everyone begins working towards the same goal.

But with the system Doctor Who uses, this discourages being deep. Authors aren't allowed to really work with others to flesh out and gain a deep understanding of characters and the world, leading to using cliches and stereotypes (as no two authors will be able to perfectly agree on the subtle nuances of a character without conferring first).

As I said, this issue is worsened by Moffat's highly secretive nature. The reveal of River Song was made *that day of filming* and only to that handful of actors. It ended up being a massive, unmitigated disaster and that's hugely because nobody else knew what was going to happen. Moffat was running on himself and himself alone.

To show you the scope: River Song has *never* been written by anyone other than Moffat. Never. Shocking, isn't it? The idea that a major character on a show would be written by one man and one man alone.

This is the core of the problem. With RTD there was no keeping things secret to only one man or hoarding characters. There were no attempts at ""mind-blowing"" twists and reveals and over-complicated series-long mysteries, so there was no dire need for a writer's room.

But now Moffat's aiming higher and he aims to do it without cooperation, and **that's** the real problem.",0,1365887391,null,0,false,0,c9el2in,t3_1cadtr,t1_c9el2in,t3_1cadtr,null,1431568255,18,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,18

I think that Warnock has tried to play with a front three (especially in the last few games, with Morison in the middle and Varney and McCormack out wide). Unfortunately it never worked, because neither McCormack nor Varney could beat their man consistently.

Now as I've repeated, seemingly ad-infinitum, regardless of YOUR interpretation, those passages DO exist in the Koran, and are pretty unambiguous to the casual observer.

Regardless of whether the ""tradition"" (sic) existed BEFORE Islam is somewhat irrelevant, as the Koran adopted all the local traditions of the time, and formalized them into the immutable word of Allah. And because of that, 1300 years later, those words CANNOT be altered, or updated to reflect modern cultural values.

I agree that religion is all about interpretation, but sometimes interpretation is making shit up. The plain fact is that the Qur'an does not say that there is a death penalty for 'lewd' people. It just plain doesn't. You can't say it does, because it doesn't. Some people nevertheless will say it does. That is their interpretation. But the fact they make such an interpretation doesn't change the fact that it isn't what it says.

There's a difference between what the Qur'an says and what muslims do. I agree that the latter is completely 100% about interpretation. And sometime ambiguities in the former mean that it is too. But sometimes it just plain doesn't say things that people claim it does. And this is one.

Even so, destroying the entire sub would kill everyone who had attacked him, which would be vengeance of a sort, and the detonation of nukes aboard a Soviet sub could easily have triggered the war that Scaldac was hoping to spark. So it's win-win for Scaldac, even if he dies in one outcome.

Then there's the point after he gets teleported into the Martian ship, at that point the Doctor's threat is removed.

What do you mean by ""pension off""? does he have a ill-health retirement scheme membership? would he qualify? 

The genuineness of the illness is irrelevant.

Describe the redundancy - is everyone in his team going, or just a role? When? How many in the role are being lost? Is this meeting a first individual redundancy consultation meeting? How far down the absence management route is he?

I doubt that they would treat him differently in the way you describe. First, because it will be against corporate policy. Mainly though because of the risk of a disability discrimination claim.

He should know however that his sickness absence could well count against him in the redundancy scoring exercise, if there is one. In his shoes I would expect to be made redundant. It is a risk that they dismiss for performance/absence, depending on timing. however if he is not far down the absence management route and they speed him down it to save a buck, this is likely to be an unfair dismissal. Hence why I say he should expect to be made redundant.

A union rep would be a helpful thing to have at his meetings, especially with his particular circumstances.

I loved my time there personally.  I don't know where to begin telling you more about it.  It's a very beautiful town but a small one, so obviously the nightlife etc is a million miles from London.  There are maybe 2 or 3 clubs and they're terrible, albeit you could say charmingly terrible.  When I was there we were lucky enough to have a strong cohort of DIY people putting on forest parties and stuff to cater for alternative tastes.  Whether or not this still happens I couldn't say, but Newcastle is within reach for bigger nightlife, shopping, big name djs / bands etc.  Also, what college you go to will affect your experience.

Academically - I rather coasted to be honest but the modules were varied (I also enjoyed that you could take a few modules outside of history altogether, again though I'm not sure if you still can.)  Some lecturers seemed better than others, as you'd expect, and none of them spoonfeed, also as you'd expect.  But overall, no complaints with the syllabus/faculty.

My career?  Not in any direct or quantifiable sense (since my job now has nothing to do with history) but I think it looks pretty decent on your CV and the ""alumni network"" potential is pretty visible; I'm not an old boy networking type but I run across Durham people pretty often in my professional life.

***Apostasy and its punishment:***

*our position on this issue is that Islam does not want to have hypocrites on board and for this reason Islam advocates for freedom of belief as there is no compulsion in religion and the issue of not enabling a citizen to change his religion in official document is a state matter that has to do with laws and constitutions which is an internal issue that differs from one country to another based on differences in the demographics and the prevailing culture.*

*So if the apostate declares renouncing his faith publicly in a way which disturbs national order then he is subjected to punishment. Disturbing national order has to do with national security which is a crime that mounts to high treason in all countries.

We still don't know when, or how it came to look like it does.  
Up until this episode we've never seen the red setting, which is notable because River's has a red setting(and dampers), that the Doctor wasn't aware of until she mentioned it.
