1. Suarez has a huge impact on our ability to play tiki-taka football. He is good on the ball, sure but his presence upfield relieves pressure on our backline and central midfield because teams must sit back more to deal with Suarez. I think that will help our possession numbers immensely.

2. We have to admit that Gerrard, while still a good player, may not always be able to go 90 mins, and may sometimes not offer the right kind of option. He is very good at making pinpoint passes on the break or finding the one pass to unlock a defense, but against Southhampton he looked less effective at retaining possession when under heavy pressure. He also runs out of gas in defensive duties midway through the second half. Joe Allen may be more suited in many cases to the style of play we are trying to achieve, especially against sides that are going to press as much as Southhampton did.

3.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"So we need wide players who can score and get into the box, and you're using that as the basis to back a player who doesn't score and rarely gets into the box? 

I agree that historically AVB likes to have a wide forward on one of the flanks, and Lamela fits that bill perfectly. Townsend does not. 

Townsend and Lennon in terms of movement are actually very similar. They both start wide and then like to run with the ball, often infield in both cases. 

Townsend is the better raw dribbler but he has no concept of the runs of other players or the overall picture of a move. He has also taken more shots than any player in the Premier League. That is fucking shocking. He is a 22 year old wide player who only had mixed results in the Championship before last season, and he's taking 5 or 6 shots per game--almost all of them from outside the box.

Meanwhile he's only creating 1-2 chances per game. Roberto fucking Soldado has created more chances with his passing than Townsend. 

Townsend does absolutely nothing without the ball. His movement is non-existent and he has no rapport with Walker. No runs in behind, no diagonal runs inside the fullback, no peeling off subtly into space, very few combinations. He gets on the ball and runs at people whether it's a good idea or not. 

Lennon may not be left-footed but he still drifts infield and creates space for Walker, and he also plays nice little combinations with Kyle. That move they do where Lennon shows for a ball to feet but then spins and gets in behind with Walker playing the ball inside the fullback? Never happens with Townsend.

Lennon is less direct and less exciting these days, but he's far smarter than given credit. He makes more runs off the ball, sees more passing opportunities, and in spite of his own inconsistency he even delivers better final balls to teammates. 

Townsend impresses people because of his fearlessness and general ability to ""look"" dangerous, but he creates very little. I'm not saying he doesn't have a future here, but he is a very talented headless chicken who would probably be better coming off the bench than starting matches. 

Lamela I don't think there's any debate to be had. He should sooner rather than later be starting in that position. He is miles more intelligent and talented than both of the alternatives.

It appears you are very uninformed towards Bitcoin. 'Mining' has nothing to do with playing Minecraft. It is a process of competing for scarce Bitcoin. They are rare because mining Bitcoin is solving a very difficult mathematical problem. This problem becomes more difficult as more people try to 'mine' Bitcoin.

Edit 1: Bitcoin is valuable for many reasons. First it is limited, meaning once all 21 million Bitcoin have been 'mined', there will be no more produced. Secondly, it is the first decentralised, peer-to-peer payment network.

Edit 2: Bitcoin isn't really a currency. It is a software protocol which shares a 'transaction ledger' on a peer-to-peer network. The network nodes or users work to secure these transactions through cryptography. Bitcoin can also facilitate more advanced transactions such as Wills or even Derrivatives. It has a 'built in' scripting language for this purpose.

Bitcoin is a complete replacement system for the current electronic finacial system which is not controlled by either central or investment banks.",0,1380043973,null,0,1380044971,0,ccejufh,t3_1mzkia,t1_ccejufh,t1_ccefogf,null,1429357663,2,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,2

* Sitting second in Prem after 5 games (level on points with 1st).
* Best defensive record in the league so far.
* Conceded only 1 goal.
* 5 points ahead of Man U

...and we are getting pretty shitty write ups or just plain being ignored by media outlets. Suits me though, let us be the dark horse and have less pressure on ourselves. I have a really positive attitude towards this season. I mean, if you look at how the Sun was reporting Liverpools brief stint at the top, they were honestly touting them as title contenders, and I firmly believe we are much much better than pool over the course of a season. 2 weeks ago the sun betting guide had Liverpool at something like 25-1 to win the league and us at 50-1. Now we are 12-1 and Liverpool are 40-1. They are fickle, don't have a clue, and just generally don't like Spurs.

Only real thing I agree with in that summation is that Marshall played a blinder and deserved the Dream Team Star Man.

While I am on a slight rant, why are we not bigging up our defense more? Everyone is going on and on about all the attacking options we have, who will play 10 etc etc but I have hardly read a peep at how fucking fantastic our defense is right now.

I agree, council housing makes up a very small amount of the housing market. Housing associations, however, make up significantly more.

I'm giving reasons that are given by those affected by the tax, and the issue of health is partly why some councils are reluctant to take people from long distances; someone from London is unlikely to get a place closer than Peterborough if moved, which is a fair distance even with modern tech. I accept it's better something than nothing, but put simply local government doesn't want the hassle.

The private sector is typically reluctant to take in those on housing benefit because there is a higher tendency for arrears to occur, and also a fear of damage. The majority of London boroughs are suffering a shortage of 1-2 bed homes, which is why rents are so high.

true,Froolow,null,null,"I think that's actually a really interesting question, and why I think the debate is so polarising. Obviously on a superficial level people wearing the niquab could choose to take it off, but on a slightly deeper level it may be that such an idea is so abhorrent to them that they don't really have a 'choice' in the true meaning of the word. It's like if a highwayman said, 'Your money or your life' - this is technically a choice, but the social and physical conditioning that people don't just casually commit suicide to protect small amounts of money means that the 'choice' really isn't sufficiently free that we regard it as meaningful.

I suspect you'll probably disagree with the above, but what I think we can probably agree on is that there is a spectrum of 'chosen-ness' with sex and race on the one end, moving into sexuality and physical attractiveness, then perhaps things like basic moral beliefs (including the niquab) and then finally 'deep' superficial things like favourite food and 'superficial' superficial things like which way you part your hair.

So I suspect we might also agree the solution lies somewhere between 'never discriminate' (against black people, for example) and 'do what you want' (about trainers, for example). I think most people agree the solution is not to bother Muslim women most of the time, and then make it an absolute requirement to be bothered other times (at airports and courts, for example), but this introduces its own set of problems; I don't think 'banks' are an example of the second set of beliefs where we can justly demand women remove the veil, but a lot of people on reddit clearly do.

But I certainly agree with your analysis; there is a meaningful difference between being black and wearing the veil, my example was only to draw out what I saw as a contradictory premise in the example given by OP",0,1380044963,null,0,false,0,ccek7wj,t3_1my9fw,t1_ccek7wj,t1_cce507d,null,1429357489,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Your solution is to force women to wear a *different kind* of clothing. I don't see how you can't spot the cognitive dissonance there; if it is wrong for someone to force women to wear something then this statement is true whether we are talking about the niquab or hijab.

To look at this another way; many Arab individuals think that the way Western society encourages women to show off a lot of skin is shameful and 'misogynist'. Their solution - which they genuinely believe is to protect women from oppressive Western misogyny - is to impose the niquab. Since neither you nor this hypothetical Arab have any particularly strong claim to being objectively correct, why would you assume you have the moral authority to impose your solution on a bunch of women who may not want it?

Does this mean children will be given some education in Politics while in school? as most people like throwing terms likes 'lefties' 'Fascists' and ' NIMBY' around like candy and not understanding what it is about..

&gt;Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle moved to stress Labour's support for HS2, after Ed Balls suggested the party's support might be in doubt

Tha party can't even decide on HS2 support what chance is there in regards to their other 'promises' (those things they talk about before being elected then dump soon as they get in (look at Camerons 'Bill of British Rights)

&gt;Mr Miliband promised Labour would build 200,000 new homes a year by 2020

Not enough and well outside the next elected term...

true,Draxton,null,null,"&gt; You move from a 3 bed cost and you need only 1 bed. 

Says...who? Are you just presuming that every person has 3 beds and could fit in 1? 

Let's use a better example. Family, two different-sex kids. Let's say they currently have 3 rooms, but the government say they should have 2 (nevermind that the children will grow up and you'll have to move up again!).

The weekly rent of a 3 bedroom *council* house in West London is £122.97 per week. This is in comparison to the cost of private which is £606.09. [Source](http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Council_housing_rents_to_remain_some_of_West_Londons_lowest.asp). The average for a 2 bedroom private in the same area (from a quick look at Zoopla) would appear to be around £500-550.

If you were currently living in a 2 bed council flat in Dundee you'd be paying £60.82 a week. [Source](https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/housingoptions/hocouncilavgrent). A 1 bedroom flat privately would cost, at minimum, £88 per week.

So where's this cost saving? Let's see the figures.

Again, you're ignoring the fact that the move into private also moves housing benefit from going to the council to going to private landlords, which adds to the housing bubble issue.


&gt;Although, we are talking about Socialist Policies - which are not about money but ending overcrowding in the country.

Says...who? Because I hear the ministers saying a lot of ""well we can't afford to subsidise"" and ""it costs the taxpayer X"". [Here's the official twitter account for DWP claiming the same thing](https://twitter.com/dwppressoffice/status/380621655921659904). Overcrowding? You're not reducing the people in the country, you're just moving them.

&gt;The fact is most people, particularly the poorest, have access to grants to move to other areas and to pay for deposit/decoration of a new property.

Oh, good. Because everyone has absolutely no ties to their current area, right? You know, kids in schools or partner working or family to look after. Moving is just as simple as putting things in a box and getting in the van. 

Get with the real world.

However, it is much easier to send money across the interent, to anywhere in the world too, than any other payment network.

Understanding Bitcoin can be difficult and take time. Using it is very simple and safe if the appropriate secure practices are taken.

I suggest looking at the Bitcoin.org site. They list lots of information about Bitcoin and a number of desktop and mobile wallets which you can use.

Sending someone Bitcoin can be as simple as scanning a QR code and confirmining the transaction.

American football  is further along on the spectrum, there are many more variables but the nature of the game means that the coach is going to instruct his players to perform to a very specific set of instructions. This is why it's often compare to chess.

&gt;Their solution - which they genuinely believe is to protect women from oppressive Western misogyny - is to impose the niquab.

This is not even done in Saudi Arabia.  
The enforcement of the burqa or niqab is cultural and carried out by a select few.  
Also, it is not done to counter a western ""shameful"" attitude as it was done *before* western influences.  
It is done to prevent men from seeing which woman to carry off back to their tribe.


&gt;The question of removing the veil in security situations is completely different, and trying to argue that the primary reason for women being forced to take of their veil in court is to liberate them from the oppressive shackles of misogyny is disingenuous at best.

&gt;You wouldn't know it but these are the words of a supposedly left-wing politician in a supposedly left-wing party. He compares the ease of access of pornography to ""Sodom and Gomorrah"", which in itself will piss off and rile up anyone who finds that tale unjust in itself.

&gt;He also compares the prevalence of online pornography to the culture of the Weimar Republic saying that there was a disintegration of the ""social order"" there (apparently unaware of the huge amount of right-wing and left-wing agitators in Germany supported by international or corporate bodies at the time and the financial collapse in 1929 that allowed them electoral success). He then goes on to suggest that such a loose moral climate in the Weimar Republic allowed extremists to develop and advance hatred towards others based on their ethnicity.

&gt;So according to David Blunkett pornography is literally Hitler.

&gt;He also describes the act of masturbation to pornography as ""bestial"".

I'm pretty sure there's a train from King's Cross to Brighton that goes through East Croydon, and outside peak hours (morning and evening commute times) you should be fine to take your bike on that.

EDIT: It's the First Capital Connect - goes through St Pancras and East Croydon, and I've taken my bike on the FCC line from Streatham before for certain.

Cycling in London is fine, I would definitely recommend a helmet, personally I don't wear a vest but I have enough lights to maintain a small disco at night time.

Obviously the infrastructure is nothing like the Netherlands, so you'll have to get used to cycling on the road with no separation from cars almost all of the time. After a month of regular cycling though I'd say it becomes second nature. I'd definitely recommend it! 

The only other thing to be aware of is that we don't always have the same passing facilities for bikes here - no barges or multi story bike parks like Amsterdam! Normally there's a metal loop nearby though. Theft here is a big thing (same as Amsterdam) so be careful to lock it well, and through both wheels!

For various reasons; it might be that X-plus-impersonators are still low risk, it might be that there is some meaningful way to distinguish between low- and high-risk situations or it might be that the value of allowing X outweighs the cost of stopping impersonators.

As an American, Hillsborough obviously doesn't affect me emotionally the same way it would affect a person with a family connection to the city. I feel this is obvious. I wasn't there and it happened before I was born, let alone when I started supporting the club. That said, I have taken the time to research the tragedy because I feel a strong connection to the club and it is obviously an important, albeit horrifying chapter in our history.

To be perfectly honest, and I mean NO disrespect by saying this, but I feel that the comments I have read surrounding Hillsborough, at least on this subreddit, have been somewhat divisive between local supporters from Merseyside and those who live elsewhere. We can't possibly understand the legacy of grief and anger that the tragedy and its aftermath have left on the Liverpool community. 

Please do not scorn us (those born abroad or after Hillsborough) for our inherent ignorance towards the matter, but instead inform us. The tragedy and the cause for justice should be something for all Liverpool supporters to rally behind, but I have yet to see it treated as such. The victims and their families are honored through the eternal flames on the club crest. We support the club, we wear the shirt with pride, and unless someone is being outright disrespectful towards the incident, I would hope that supporters would refrain from beating up those who don't fully understand Hillsborough.

true,niallmd,null,null,"He denied accusations that he had benefited from the sale of land in the capacity of executor - there was also the implication of it being sold to ""Republicans"" - I have no idea why the FM decided to use this description apart from an attempt to smear.

The entire thing is absolutely absurd. I won't even say pathetic. I follow the assembly most days and almost weekly, Sunny Jim will ask Robinson a question which will then be answered by Robinson attacking Allister's character (usually over 'land deals' though this is never elaborated on) rather than actually address the question. This all goes back to Allister leaving the DUP (for the second time), forming his own party and directly challenging the DUP and to a greater or lesser extent (whichever way you view the FM's disposition) Robinson's dealings with Fred Fraser.

The glee and rabid excitement from his DUP colleagues when Robinson is perceived to have bested Allister was enough for me to turn it off. Absolutely absurd. Is that what passes for an answer? Or being clever? Or an attempt to guttersnipe Allister's cosying up with the DUP disaffected? ""You may think that we have been out of touch, and have shirked our duties to unionist voters - but we'd never sell land to Republican's"". I don't think the people who'd be swayed by that rhetoric tend to keep abreast of Stormont debates.

This public slapfight has been going on for years between Allister and the DUP if you follow Stormont, but this is by far the most ridiculous accusation I've seen leveled.",0,1380053922,null,0,1380054147,0,ccenng7,t3_1n1j5t,t1_ccenng7,t3_1n1j5t,null,1429355815,11,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,11

true,lgf92,null,null,"**QUESTION 7 SHOULD BE ""What is your prediction for Leeds this season?"" obviously**

Just for reference, here's my answers from the other side!

&gt; How do you think you'll line up?

Pards has come out and said he'll play a strong team, but even so I think we'll compromise in a couple of positions, especially left wing where we're weak. I think we'll see Krul, Debuchy-Taylor-Mbiwa-Dummett, Sissoko-Gosling-Anita, Ben Arfa-Cisse-Marveaux OR Sammy Ameobi.

&gt; How was Newcastle's summer? Are you happy with the transfer deals done?

Hahahah. No. Our summer was dreadful. Got Remy on loan, lost a good squad player in James Perch to Wigan. We still can't shift the shite in our squad (Williamson and Gosling had moves fall through, Obertan is MIA). We brought in Joe Kinnear ffs.

&gt; What is your style of play going to be like this season?

So far we've seen a mixture of a cool, pass-through-the-middle, composed play based on possession, and a panicky hoofball style which we played all last season. As soon as we lose Cabaye or HBA, we go back to hoofing the ball to a lone striker.

&gt; How much importance are you placing on this match?

We're *probably* not going to win the league, so to have a run in either of the cups is the best we can hope for this year. Unless it ends up getting us relegated.

&gt; Who should we watch out for / who is your biggest threat?

On their days, Cabaye and Ben Arfa. Coloccini, if he plays is solid. Ben Arfa is meteoric at times and absent at others.

&gt; Which of our players are you most afraid of?

With matches like this, if players get up for it, any of them can be dangerous. I hear Diouf has a reputation in the cup.

&gt; What is your prediction for Newcastle this season?

Scrappy but safe. Finish 12-15th.

&gt; How do you think Leeds will do this season?

I don't pay as much attention to the Championship as I should, but consensus seems to be a mid-table finish. Would like to see you in the premier league again!

&gt; Scoreline prediction?

Going to go for a nervy 2-1 Newcastle win.

&gt; If your football club was a fruit, what fruit would it be?

(e.g if she gets pregnant and says oh my mentor knew i was having sex, i could get fucked over and the organisation would be shut down because it is illegal for her to have sex, i didn't share that information with a teacher and now the organisation doesn't exist anymore to help kids)

but i understand what you mean about being a 'snitch' in her eyes and obviously not wanting to alienate her. i will use my judgement but i also have a legal and moral duty to keep her out of harms way. i'm doing this through the school and actually having sessions with her in the school (they can be moved outside if we agreed to do so).

Your right on the point that rent goes from Social to PRS in one instance. In the reverse the family that was moved, goes from PRS to Social... 

&gt; Overcrowding? You're not reducing the people in the country, you're just moving them.

This policy is because theirs family's in overcrowded accommodation, in need of social housing. When a person is in 3 bed, but need just one.

Socialist policies are not about money - it costs a hell of a lot - its about a safeguard for the most needy. If it costs a little more, I am not bothered as long as people are adequately housed to their needs.

&gt;Moving is just as simple as putting things in a box and getting in the van.

Yes it is. You can make excuses, ""ties to the community"". If its a decision on homelessness - or knowing your neighbors. Book that van!
Universal Education means transit between schools can be done easily. If a family member is working, then great they can afford the £14 for the extra room.

You need to get with the real world, and abandon the pathetic retheric of ties to an area. Their is a housing crisis and decisions need to be made in the short term, moving to a more affordable area is common sense.

Swindon played really well, they weren't afraid to attack and even hit the back of the net once (Pritchard assist) but it was called back for offside. Pritch is still very raw and lost the ball a few too many times but certainly impressed in his willingness to take a man on and also in set pieces. He showed a willingness to defend (he toggled between LW and CAM through the middle) but his defensive positioning wasn't grand, a few times Mata slipped off of the back of him which could have been dangerous had a Chelsea player spotted it.

Swindon were winning possession in the 2nd half something like 70% - 30%, so they definitely were doing things right, Chelsea picked up 2 first half injuries which hampered them.

The John Hurt Doctor is assumed to be a missing incarnation between 8, and 9. Evidence of this is based on his clothes. 8's vest, with 9's leather jacket (the *exact* same one, mind you). People speculate that this incarnation did something so terrible that he forced himself to regenerate into the next body. This terrible deed is probably ending the time war, and commiting genocide. It is therefore known as his greatest secret. Genocide being the horrific crime that it is, is something the Doctor would never do. Hurt ended the Time War ""in the name of peace, and sanity."" He would never forgive himself if he allowed the Time Lords to carry out the Ultimate Sanction (their plan to destroy all reality to ascend as creatures of conciousness alone). His final solution, while done to save the universe, and end the Time War was an act of peace. What he had done to achieve it was a terrible act in itself.

true,masungura,null,null,"I thought of a couple other things, specifically regarding differences between cycling in London &amp; other parts of the UK vs. what North American commuters might be used to.

- one of the reasons why many people are warning about undertaking is that pedestrian crossings are often set back from the intersection, and the corners may often have railings set up, [like so](http://www.international.fhwa.dot.gov/pubs/pl10010/images/figure16b.jpg).  If you're undertaking a larger vehicle, say you're going straight and it's turning left, or even if it's also going straight but just getting a little too close, you have nowhere to go if you get into trouble there.  You don't have a hope of hopping the curb or even falling over onto the sidewalk; your chances of being crushed against the railing or falling back into the road are much higher.
- There are very, very few stop signs.  A line of double dashes painted across the road (like so =====) is a yield sign.
- As for those bike boxes at the front of intersections, pretty much everyone will expect you to get into it when you're coming up to a red light with some traffic waiting.  Of course you should do so if you feel you have space, but remember the precautions about undertaking.  Motorcycles and scooters will also join you in the bike box, and so...
- There's an advance signal before the green light, at which point EVERYONE FLOORS IT LIKE IT'S FORMULA ONE including the motorcycles and scooters, which accelerate faster than you but will probably be just *behind* you in the bike box.  Therefore it's crucial to hold your line when coming off a green light.",0,1380058673,null,0,false,0,ccepg58,t3_1myhgw,t1_ccepg58,t3_1myhgw,null,1429354977,2,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,2

Have conversations about TV shows and celebrity gossip- this way you'll begin to seem more like a friend than yet another teaching figure tryig to get her to talk about her issues.

Try not to talk down to her in any way- she will immediatley recognise this and distance herself from you. Treat her like a friend.

For the first few sessions, keep it light and focus on getting to know her. Maybe watch a TV show she also watches outside of your sessions, it will help you bond and give you some new small talk for each week- X-Factor is probably a good bet.

After you and her are comfortable with each other, focus mainly on her future to begin with, if she wants to go to uni, what she wants to do, etc, etc. Help her realise what she'll need to do to get there and what she can do to prepare.

true,robertemmett,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"It can be daunting, indeed. I grew up watching Pertwee, Baker and Davison on Sunday nights on PBS. When the reboot happened in 2005, I really got back into it and wanted to catch up on 'Everything'.

Some of it is very enjoyable, some of it I suffered through. The very earliest stuff has not aged well. The pace is so much slower, and the stories so stretched out, that it is hard to sit through some of it. 

But there are some really good Hartnell and Troughton stories that, if you can get past the pacing, are really engrossing and memorable.

The biggest hurdle for me was that so many of the episodes have been lost. Erased by the BBC. I feel Troughton could easily be my favorite Doctor or at least in the top 3, but so little of his era remains, so it is especially difficult to get a real feel for him. The continuity is lost, just a handful of stories with very little to hold them together in the Grand picture. Some of the reconstructions are very well done, but some of them feel like the film strips we used to have in school, with slides and an audio track that beeped when it was time to go to the next slide.

Once the show switched to color at the beginning of Pertwees run, things improve- just in the fact that everything is available. Still, the pacing in the 1970's is a crawl compared to what we are accustomed to today; but if you stick with it you can get a good feel for Pertwee and Tom Baker and the rest. 

The stories ebb and flow, there are some brilliant stories, and some that make you wonder how they were green-lighted and produced in the first place. 

It can be an overwhelming undertaking, no doubt about it. I am a completist and stubborn as hell to boot. Some of it I suffered through just for fulfillment, just to be able to say I have watched it all.

I would like to be able to suggest to anyone getting into New Who to go back and watch all the classics. But this just isn't feasible to most, with something like 27 years of stories, and could very well scare new fans away. 

I would suggest that, as far as entire runs, Tom Baker and Peter Davison are a must- but this is my opinion only, and I am sure I will rub some classic fans the wrong way. 

At the very least, I would suggest you watch as much of each incarnation as you can humanly stand, there are often lists going around with the 'essential' stories from each era. 

There is a lot of history here. Some of it stands up to time better than the rest. Some of it is entirely missable except to the completists like myself. Take your time and realize it will take several months, at least, if you intend to go through everything. But, luckily, I do not think that there will be a test.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"What is behind Bitcoin?

1. Lower fees
2. Lower transaction costs
3. No barrier to adoption
4. Far far easier to adopt than card machines
5. Cheaper than card machines (from a business PoV)
6. No overdraft charges (you are your own bank)
7. A far FAR higher rate of 'room to grow' (e.g. increase in value) than it can decrease.
8. Does not rely on bank trust (have you looked at the economy lately?)

9. Does not have 'middle-men' (it is FULLY INCLUSIVE!)
 9.1 - no more stolen funds from 'charities'
 9.2 - no more massive cuts for businesses and individuals when send money anywhere (to friends or for buying goods)
 9.3 - no ability for the banks and corrupt powers that be to STOP your transactions

10. Banks and governments can not seize your wealth (unless they waterboard you and you give up your password).

11. Whenever you use your credit/debit card you are GIVING full access to your card details to whoever is on the other side (phone or net), and they can then use your details and spend your money.
12. Point 11 does not compute with Bitcoin (its impossible).
13. Bitcoin is HIGHLY fraud resistant.
14. Bitcoin is very young and has amazing potential to grow and develop (9.0 will be very interesting).
15. There is a limit to how much you can withdraw from an ATM and/or from your Bank.
16. There is a limit to how much money (fiat/paper money) you can take with you when you go abroad.
17. Officials (or anyone) can steal your money whilst you travel, etc.
18. 15, 16, and 17 does not apply to Bitcoin.
19. Bitcoin is open source!! (extremely important!)
20. All addresses are publicly viewable!!! (amagad! yes really, imagine if you could see all the corruption in government and official bodies, because you could see exactly who was donating/bribing what and how much).

21. Imagine, you're in tescos (or a bus, or any other shop, etc), there are huge queues, people are paying with their change, and you're having to wait for credit card transactions to go through. 30 minutes later you finally get served.

22. Imagine, you're in tescos, etc, there are huge queues, everyone takes 10-20 seconds to pay, because all they have to do is &gt; face phone to screen, push phone (send) button, done.

23. Taxes. Imagine all the stupidly rich and corrupt (individuals and businesses) could no longer hide all their taxes (freaking government preaches about tax evasion, when really its the millionaires and the corps that do 90% (probably more) of the tax evasion). Imagine the economy recovering from all that wealth coming back into the system.

24. Accountability. Imagine politicians and those in power being held accountable for their actions.

25. Inflation (end of). Hyperinflation is incoming, government has lied about inflation for quite a long time. If you really want to see the true rates of inflation look at the value of milk, bread, a chocolate bar, etc, over the last 10 years, that will give you a good example of the true rate.
 25.1 - The bitcoin protocol actually has inflation also ('mining'), but at FAR lesser rate (in value) and with a system that steadily decreases over time.

26. Deflation - Natural deflation is the real state of an economy. Inflation is a lie, and has been used as a tool to control the masses and divert wealth to the extremely few. Bitcoin suffers from natural deflation (which is a VERY GOOD thing!).

27. Uncontrollable bankers. Banks are too big and corrupt to stop head on, there are way too many politicians in the bankers pockets (and the army).

Stopping here, could go on, but will leave you (the reader) to go out and learn more.

(... not quite sure how to put this...)

... I've been watching (and reading, when the family wouldn't let me watch) *Doctor Who* since the Third Doctor's days; and have very certainly gone back to cover all the episodes that aired before I was born. And a large proportion of the novels between the end of the Seventh Doctor's TV run and the new Ninth Doctor's series (and one of the best, smartest, most brain-cocoon-breaking *Doctor Who* spinoffs the world has ever seen, [*Faction Paradox*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faction_Paradox)).

Science-Fiction is used as a vehicle for many, many things. Heck, *Firefly* is a *X-Files* Western in Science-Fiction. If I may suggest? Check out [Google's take on science fiction and contemporary issues](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;as_q=science%20fiction%20contemporary%20issues). *Stargate* was anthropology, comparative religious studies and military cameraderie with scientist-army tensions as a character vehicle. *Farscape*, like *Voyager* was *Homer's Odyssey* (although with *Farscape*, a lot more character-antagonistic). *Babylon 5* was sociology, cultural studies and mythology rolled into a science-fiction bun.

The Third Doctor's days were characterised by action and adventure. For the first time, the Doctor sheds a tear over a departing assistant, and **not** because they'd spent their time staring longingly at each other and kissing. The last time anything close to that happening was when the First Doctor's ""granddaughter"" left/was-forced-to-leave to get married.

The Fourth Doctor's days were characterised not only by big curly hair and a goofy grin, but also by a deep interest in knowledge, science, learning, curiosity, an open mind.

The Seventh Doctor's days were characterised at first by a Second-Doctor-like mild disarming buffoonery, which rapidly became a darker and much more powerful take on deeper powers throughout the universe; and the educating of an assistant to become something much more effective than *Torchwood* could even hope to be.

In fact, Russell Davies's (and *terrifyingly*, Moffat's) run have been considered by some (***definitely*** me) as being **heavily disappointing**, because they've lost the more mind-bending / growing / educational / educat**ed** / intelligent aspects to their writing... sacrificing the good, out-there, make-you-think writing and concepts for the cheap, commercially accessible, intellectually accessible, sell-more-merchandise writing and cheaply-formulaic heart-jerkers.

The *Doctor Who* world is big enough to accomodate both. But the problem is that we're not getting enough of one because now we're getting *nothing but the other*.

What you say about *Doctor Who* is entirely true, **if and only if** you take **only** the 2005-onwards episodes into account.

... which is the most ***damning*** thing that can be said about the 50-year history of *Doctor Who*.

In 1983, I raced to a newsagent to buy the 20th Anniversary glossy colour *Doctor Who* magazine. I treasured that thing, bought a spare, carried the first with me to school every week in a special folder. I barely considered that we'd be lucky enough to get a 50th anniversary, let alone that there'd be episodes leading right up to it.

And now, people say ""Who has always been more about emotions and, well having fun"".

After five series and two generations of movies, it was easy to give up *Star Trek* after Abrams destroyed it with that **filthy abomination** in 2009. *Star Trek Into Darkness* is the first ever *Star Trek* I refused to even watch as a pirate copy.

And now I have to ask myself: if this is what *Doctor Who* is become, if this is what people think 50 years of *Doctor Who* is summed up as...

... now I have to ask if the ~~television show~~ cultural entity that raised me with better standards, thirst for knowledge and love for science than even my own parents managed is dead and gone, if it's finally been mongrelised and **raped** into something that makes it...

For what it's worth, thanks for showing me that I'm too invested in *Doctor Who* and few people really understand or appreciate the history. I had a touch of this when my 16-year-old niece told me she was a huge *Doctor Who* fan ""who'd even watched *The Aztecs* 1960s episode"", but still didn't really care for any assistants before Rose. That's when I started to realise ""oh, crap. People really don't get it. This is what people think now"".

But I'm really afraid that you've just really hit home with this. You've just shown me what five years of talking to my niece failed to do.

2) See above. You're on separate private ranges for wired and wireless. An app which runs on both devices and maintains a constant connection to the outside world is likely to work. One which expects both devices to be on the same network, or expects an external server to be able to make an inbound connection to your computer, won't. One where you enter the PC IP manually probably will but your IP is not guaranteed to stay the same.

3) We've never liked them, because they cause support overhead, but you won't get in trouble for running one. Make sure all devices are validated individually before plugging the switch in, and bear in mind that you'll get no support with any issues if things work fine when they're the only device connected and the switch isn't in the way.

4) Oh hell yes. Wired you get 100mbps all to yourself. Wireless you're sharing *up to* about 150mbps with the rest of your flat/corridor/floor. And that's absolute best case.

2 – How was Leeds’ summer? Are you happy with the transfer deals done?

Hit and miss, we spent 1million for the first time in 6 years, but we didn't bring enough in. The summer was made a hell of a lot better with the sacking of Ken Bates though.

3 – What is your style of play going to be like this season?

On the deck, pass to McCormack/Diouf see if the can do anything, rinse and repeat, until the 80min mark when Smith usually comes on then it's hit it at the giants head.


4 – How much importance are you placing on this match?

A lot because it's a 5 hour journey! But club wise I don't think they're taking it too serious but it's hard not to with 6000 Leeds fans following you.

5 – Who should we watch out for / who is your biggest threat?

McCormack by a country mile. Would imagine your left winter will struggle against Byram if he's back to fitness though, he's already tamed the likes of Bale

6 – Which of our players are you most afraid of?

Cisse is an obvious threat, but realistically if it's a similar team than Morecambe the ameobis! 

7 – What is your prediction for Leeds this season?

8th-10th hopefully push on to top 6 

8 – How do you think Newcastle will do this season?

around the 10th spot mark

9 – Scoreline prediction?

New 1-2 Lee (McCormack double)

10 – If your football club was a fruit, what fruit would it be?

Not a fruit but marmite would be the best food product to describe Leeds.

Lucas isn't 100% fit yet, so wouldn't it make more sense to stick in Allen and Hendo in front of Gerrard to have more players get into the box when chances are created?

By moving Gerrard in a deeper position, we'd be making sure he's able to play the full 90, receive the ball from the back, and allowed enough time to look for the pass up the field which he's more than capable of. By playing two midfielders in front of him, we're allowing for more runs inside the box, which creates more chances on goal. We're winning games this season by 1-0, and we might've had more goals if there were players at the ends of those chances.

true,FrozenFire777,null,null,"I was able to stand through it because I watched it before the Newer series, and had a clear goal in mind. I tried to watch it in order, though I skipped those that had missing episodes. Pertwee and (Tom) Baker really got me interested, but then things died off in Davidson's era. I don't think that he was a boring Doctor, it was just that after Baker, I could finally see the end of the classic series and the start of the new one. 

But, as you are in different circumstances, I would suggest some from each doctor.

Minor Spoilers for Classic Series below.

Hartnell: The Dalek Invasion of Earth. While boring at times, it was the first Dalek serial that truly showcased their ruthlessness and cruelty, add along a First Doctor quote still known today and the first departure of a companion, and it was a great serial. If you can manage this, then The Chase is a good serial too.

Troughton: I'd really recommend The War Games. It is a doozy (10 episodes IIRC), but it is well worth it, establishing the Time Lords with a plot worthy of the modern era, if a bit slow. It loses some of the emotion of the departure by not having seen the previous episodes, but it is a good serial to learn about Troughton. 

Pertwee: I'd recommend his first serial as it introduces the both the Autons and post-regeneration craziness. I'd also heavily recommend any serial, if not all, from his second season as they all focus around introducing The Master, who the Third gets heavily acquainted with. Oh and If you care little for good plots and just want to see it for the name, then watch The Three Doctors too

Tom Baker: So much Tom Baker Episodes, and so much that are good. Let's see... Genesis of the Daleks, The Deadly Assassin, The Invasion of Time, all of his fifth season is a brilliantly done arc, and his last two serials connect to Davidson's first, so I'd recommend those three all together.

Davidson: Earthshock is a must, and his last three serials are all, in my mind, brilliant. Don't care much for spoiling anything big, beside from the fact that I absolutely detest Tegan, a companion who finds a way to stick around for 3 seasons. Also, don't forget The Five Doctors movie. 

Colin Baker: A misunderstood Doctor in an overly flashy suit, he is actually one of my favorites. He actually, temporarily, fixed the TARDIS' chameleon circuit in Attack on the Cybermen, and had a decent Dalek serial. I'd recommend The Two Doctors because Troughton brings that one alive, but above all else, I heavily recommend the group of mini-serials collectively known as Trial of a Time Lord. The final season starts to bring the 6th out of his shell, just in time for him to regenerate. *sigh*

McCoy: I'll admit, I skipped most of McCoy, as I was really looking forward to moving on at this point but his first serial, if nothing else for his post regeneration craziness (the best out of them all, imo), is a good watch, and Remembrance of the Daleks holds a feeling of saying good bye to a long-time, insane, murderous group of friends. Also electric baseball bat.

If nothing else, just pick a serial or two from each Doctor to get a feel for how they rolled, it will make the newer series that much more enjoyable. (In my humble opinion, and by humble I do mean arrogant)

I think what you've identified is that some, notionally on the left, are in fact highly conservative and reactionary, in which case I agree.  There is also definitely another thread in Christianity - particularly in places like Latin America, that of liberation theology, which takes a much more left wing slant on Jesus' teachings and has revolutionary undertones.  To some extent this is an attempt to reclaim Christianity from the right, because clearly, in its earliest form, Christianity was a seditious doctrine, destabilising society from below.  On the other hand, He rapidly became written up as the most important Lord, and God as the ultimate dictator who knew everything and punished thought crime with eternal damnation, and this was used by those in power to maintain hierarchies - the King appointed by God, the nobility as lords in this realm, the priesthood interpreting His word (and bending opinion in parishes in favour of the noble who tenured them, as the only source of news about the outside world).

Kenny; Warnock, Wooton, Pearce, Byram; Green, Austin, Murphy, McCormack; Smith, Poleon


&gt;2 - How was Leeds’ summer? Are you happy with the transfer deals done?

 Not very good, although we spent big money for the first time in 8 (?) years, the squad overall is still not good enough to challenge for a automatic spot, though with Bee Mac Dee in charge I wouldn't rule out a play off spot.



&gt;3 -What is your style of play going to be like this season? 

Brian said we'd be one of the best passing sides in the division and while I don't personally believe our squad is possible of that, I appreciate his ambition and love the idea of us playing attractive football.



&gt;4 - How much importance are you placing on this match?

Personally, I love the League cup. We outplayed Everton last season and I really enjoyed the Chelsea match (despite us gettting battered). It gives us a chance to show off our fantastic support and allows us to show off our potential against better teams. 


&gt;5 Who should we watch out for / who is your biggest threat?

Last season I would have said Byram, but as he is currently still on the path to full fitness, so I'll say Ross McCormack. He can make something out of nothing and is very capable on his day.


&gt;6 -  Which of our players are you most afraid of?

Ben Arfa. He is incredibly talented and I was so disappointed to miss him when I was living in Newcastle (leg break). He has the potential to win points on his own and I expect him to do so this season.


&gt;7 - What is your prediction for Hull this season?

They crash and burn.


&gt;8 – How do you think Newcastle will do this season?

I honestly don't know. They have a very talented squad but so many questions over selection. Honestly, I wish them all the best and I expect they are more than capable of a top half finish.


&gt;9 - Scoreline prediction?

3-1 Newcastle.


&gt;10 - If your football club was a fruit, what fruit would it be?

A lemon. Leaves such a bitter taste in my mouth.

Another thing is I think Kelly brings all that you're talking about. He's a lot faster than most think and made quite a few bombing runs forwards for us last season.

Our team has a dominant midfield that really helps us control the field quickly regaining the ball and preventing a lot of chances for the other team in our third of the pitch. In tough matches it may not be as apparent but as you watch us play other weaker teams and look at how they lose possession and their attacks breakdown or never get started you will appreciate what we have. Arguably the best in the league. And very deep. My initial reaction when we invested in midfield was a very ignorant BUT WE NEED STRIKERS/ GOALS!

Wired will be faster, more predictable. At the moment we don't block anything on either, that may change for wireless to keep it healthy. BitTorrent for example, used wired for that.

Romelu Lukaku has revealed the secret behind his predatory skills in front of goal – he watches every second of every Premier League game.

The Belgian striker scored the winner on his Everton debut at West Ham on Saturday, raising more questions over the wisdom of Chelsea’s decision to allow him to join the Toffees on loan for the season.

It may be his powerful build and raw pace that frightens his opponents on the pitch, but Lukaku revealed it is his studious approach off the field that has helped him develop into one of the Premier League’s most dangerous strikers.

‘It’s true that I watch every single game in the league – 90 minutes. I take my time to study and to learn other strikers’ movements and to learn about other defenders. I take my time,’ said the 20-year-old, who is fluent in six languages – Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, English and a native tongue in Ghana.

‘Really I want to be one of the best in this league so you can only learn from the best by watching the best.

‘After training I go home and record every game. I have a satellite and I just watch the games.

‘My aim is to go down as one of the greatest. That’s why I’m at Everton. I’m here to help the team, the team is here to help me.

‘Everton were that step I needed. As a team they are always close to the top four and get to cup finals. That was really interesting for me.’",0,1380093482,null,0,false,0,ccezpcm,t3_1n37n4,t1_ccezpcm,t3_1n37n4,null,1429350059,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

Arsenal bidding 40 million and one pound was not something they did because they read about his clause in the media, they'd be stupid to do that, they were obviously tipped off, most likely by Guardiola who would have had Suarez's permission to do so.

He tried to force his way out of the club publicly, when he didn't get his way by trying to do it in private, there's no two ways about it.

I'll be around today to respond to questions and comments should there be any.


**Whats wrong with our new pensions?**


**Our old pension was far too generous and this is generally accepted**, people were getting promoted within their final 3 years (which determined their pension payouts) just to get a huge increase in their lump sum/monthly amount etc. etc. In days gone by this was not a problem as the reality was, firefighters died pretty soon after retiring due to a career of being abruptly awaken to have 100 seconds to be dressed and rolling on blues alongside poorer health and safety standards. These days those pesky H&amp;S lot would have us all die of old age in our beds


**The protections for those who fail to make it the retirement age of 60**. Our argument is not that we want to retire at 55 or even 50, it's what happens to the majority of firefighters of whom the governments own report stated as men being ""unlikely to be able to remain operational passed 55, let alone to 60"" and female firefighters pretty much being lucky to make it passed 50 at all. With the new pensions, should firefighter become unable to meet operational fitness standards (and these are worryingly, and unrepresentative of the real world, low already) then if they are under 55 they stand to *lose their job and have their pension frozen (not inflation linked) until national pension age* (up to 68 currently if i recall). **So to recap this is someone who's done nothing but a very specific job for all their life paying a large % of his salary into his pension could easily end up getting sacked for incompetence leaving him without any income for up to 18 years at which point they receive their pension which has dwindled 30-50% due to not being inflation linked.** 
 
- But the government says they'll give you a non-operational job within the brigade like they do in the army/police?

- The fire service, particularly with the harsh cuts scarily reducing your fire cover, has very few support staff comparatively. For example my brigade has around 330 Firefighters compared to 131 support staff; Most of which are specialised (I.E. Health and Safety, HR, Legal etc.). There simply is no opportunity for moving operational firefighters to non-operational roles.


**The amount we get back at the end. Firefighters pensions are fairly generous old or new, this is not disputed. What the papers won't mention is th**at we will pay 15.2% of our wages into them for an absolutely atrocious employee/employer ratio of 1/1.05. I don't have their exact figures to hand but no other public sector pay near this amount nor get such a low employer contribution in return for the lower % of their pay they do pay in. Are pensions are slightly better than average because we pay a hell of a lot to them.

**The high risk of an already high contribution rate for 15.2% being increased** due to people leaving/fire service number dwindling/the government raiding the schemes coffers again. For the latter point, the government promised to leave our pensions alone for a minimum of 25 years last time they're drastically cut into them; Here we are again 7 years later, how much worse does it get next time? For the first points, the scheme relies on a stable ratio of people paying into the scheme to retired FFs being paid out by the scheme. Now consider;

- The government has stated they've played a very strict cost ceiling to the pension, if there's a shortfall it's not being made up for by them

- Firefighter numbers are being worryingly reduced all over the country

- Less and less firefighters are signing up to the scheme (based on the last two big brigade intakes)

- There's a back log of people leaving the scheme coming. The government has been increasing our rates for the last 3 years and argue that because there's been minimal leavers that people are happy and that all is well. In reality Firefighters naturally aren't throwing their pension scheme away until it gets decided concretely what the pension will be like which has not been clear for many years now since they announced they were coming for the pensions again. When it finally gets announced there's a very high chance a fair proportion of current paying in members will leave, if only for the security of a pension plan that the government won't have the papers decree as being ""gold plated"" before pillaging it....again. 

The above points could very realistically lead to a ""run"" on the scheme causing the government to have to bail it out effectively. Initial contribution rates increase -&gt; people leave -&gt; Government reviews and finds it needs to make up short fall thus raises contribution rates -&gt; More people leave -&gt; Rinse, repeat.


It's also very well worth noting that **the 15.2% of our pay is an estimate from the government**, they haven't even figured out for sure what it will be. Would you sign a contract for an estimated figure which could very well be more?


Quashing common myths;

- Firefighters sleep all night - We do sleep yes but only between 1am and 7am...if we're lucky. With the exception of the quieter stations (of which are becoming few and far between as brigades all around close more and more stations) the majority of the time you'll be awakened at least once if not 2-3 times after that. Also, bear in mind that our night shift if 15 hours so even with 6 hours ""sleep"" we're still working a 9hour shift. 

- Firefighters all have second incomes - I always find this strange that because we choose to work some more on top of a 42hour average work week we get labelled as greedy but it's true a lot of us, myself included, have second incomes generally in the shape of manual labour (Window cleaning, Gardening, decorating etc.). Anyone with a 9-5 job also has this option available to them in reality in my opinion; Whats the difference between someone who works night shifts then a second job in the day (Fire service) and someone who works in the day picking a second job up in the nights (Joe public)? Obviously personal lives come into it but no more for one group or the other. 

- Firefighters do very little at work but eat and work out - This is perhaps the most pervasive myth and 10 or so years ago it was perhaps closer to the truth. True we get 40minutes a shift to go in station gyms but then, do you want a weak unfit fire fighter coming to rescue you who uses up all their air before they get to you because they're unfit or can't lift you when they do find you? For the rest of the shift we're always training (Fire calls have gone down recently so we have to train so much more to maintain standards), doing community fire safety (Every year 1 and 5 class of schools gets a 2hour+ visit a year and we're slowly but inexorably visiting every house in the country fitting free smoke alarms and giving fire safety advice, to name two main activities), doing paper work, standard testing our equipment (When we need it, we need it to work right. As such everything on the appliance is tested ranging from daily to weekly to monthly and so on) or whatever else we need to be done. Whilst there certainly is nothing to do for us when we're ""sleeping"" at night, it's largely because we work hard in the day and get everything done.

So, yeah, definitely needs to see someone and get some guidance on this. Particularly if this is one of those ""abuse begets abuse"" crimes (i.e. they learned acting that way from their own horrible experiences).    

&gt; Silly girl probably asked for it.   

I hate bullshit like this. Why can we not just have an adult discussion without getting dragged down into the mud?    

This is a crime between two VERY young children. There are no easy answers, there is no clear cut right and wrong, it is all shades of grey. It has absolutely nothing to do with gender politics (and if the roles were reversed the same would be true).

Probably, just the latter.  When I was mentoring, we had a simple solution to these things, discretion on a case by case basis.  If I know that a kid has been smoking weed for the last 2 years, I am not going to tell anyone if he tells me about it.  Doing so doesn't change the situation.

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"&gt; We know a recent Gallup survey already found zero percent of British Muslims think gay relationships are acceptable.

Your statistics are wrong. Not all British Muslims were surveyed, so you cannot say 'zero percent'. You can say that it is likely to be approximately or less than one-hundreth of a percent. Almost as bad, admittedly, but saying zero is just sensationalism.

&gt; I would've said I wasn't proud of the way Britain treats gay people because (1) we still don't have equal rights

Britain ranks as best in Europe for gay rights, see [here](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/05/16/ilga-europe-releases-2013-european-lgbt-rights-map/). So not equal, maybe, but certainly pretty pro-gay.

The actual wording was 'morally acceptable', i.e. acceptable according to their relgious beliefs. Ask any religious group this question that they will probably reply the same. This does not explain why the French result is so different, but it could be due to differences in how 'Muslim' was defined in French statistics. It could also be due to the different wording used (since it was in French) may lead the respondent differently. You would expect Gallup to account for this, but sometimes interlingual equivalence is not possible since different words have different meanings and associations.

Anyhow, the point I am getting to is that, even if British Muslims don't see any wiggle room in Islam to allow for homosexuality, it does not mean that they don't want homosexuals to have all possible rights and privileges according to the law of the land.

Not sure about that though. Has anyone shouted you down?

I recognise Islam has got issues to address. Reasoned arguments like your own will only get shouted down by morons. Unreasonable arguments will get shouted down by reasonable people. The trouble is, those making unreasonable arguments tend to hide behind/within people such as yourself, who are raising genuine concerns. And then they claim you can't question anything without being labelled a racist.

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"&gt;  there is this kind of ""secret club"" that any non-muslim can't be a part of when alone they will happily talk with everyone but when there are other muslims about they will talk amongst themselves and keep everyone else from interacting, still nice people but segregating themselves off.

Same too for other groups, like football fans or men or women. They all congregate to converse on the subjects that bind them to the exclusion of others. To establish that the effect is markedly different for Muslims you need to show that:

* They do this with Muslims outside their eithnic group and do not do it with non-Muslims inside their eithnic group;
* They do it more than people of other ethnic, religious or cultural groups do it with each other.

The latter shows that it is a real effect, and the former shows that it is Islam based. Without both of these, you thesis lacks evidence.

&gt; How does Britain treat gay people exactly?

Better than any other European country, see [here](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/05/16/ilga-europe-releases-2013-european-lgbt-rights-map/). Since European countries are pretty gay friendly anyway, that'll put us pretty close to the top in the world.

&gt; So maybe the reason you are fine with Muslims as a whole is because the media you read gives you such a positive impression of them unlike the bogeymen ""bigots"" of guardian fame

There comes a time in everyone's life when they realise the world doesn't think as they do. The reaction to her death, which from my perspective bordered on mass psychosis, was that moment for me. I didn't dislike her, she was just some woman. It never actually dawned on me that all the royal stories in the papers wouldn't have been there if there wasn't a market for them though. 

It was also the moment I was most proud of my dad. Bradford Bulls were playing in London that day. There were two league games left in the season and they'd won every game up to that point. The title was already in the bag but there was no way we weren't going to see them get a complete 100% sweep of all the regular games. We had to get up early for the coach trip and found out pretty early on that she was dead. All the way down on the bus we were hearing of sporting events being cancelled and postponed. The London team were then owned by Richard Branson, a friend of hers, and it seemed likely to us that the game would be postponed but until we heard news we were still going. 

When we arrived at the stadium and found out the game was still on we went in the bar and it was packed but completely silent with everyone watching the rolling news. My dad broke the silence with ""She's still fucking dead then?""

I have never been more proud.

Those days would be done through your zero-hours contract with the NHS Bank.

The main issue with many zero-hours contracts is they explicitly ban the employee from taking another job.  In the NHS if you are not available for work under the zero-hours contract it doesn't matter, you simply say you don't want the work.  For other employers you cannot say ""no"" when they call you in (well, you can but they will sack you or put you to the bottom of the list).",0,1380103278,null,0,false,0,ccf0udu,t3_1n1313,t1_ccf0udu,t1_ccejx5j,null,1429349527,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Jos got his Tuesday night goal. Looked good in first half, less in the second. Similar for Maya.

Cambers and Ward-Prowse seemed to be comfortable together on the right. I would feel confident in them to start in PL games, though Clyne is still my favored RB.

Lee looked OK, don't think he's ever going to play in PL.

Cork was working hard and came close to getting a goal. It's ashame he doesn't play much in PL, but I think Wanyama needs another 5 or so games at least to gel with the team.

Steven Davies was solid as well, but didn't do anything really spectacular. 

Fox was average, a few wayward passes nothing to awful.

Kelvin made some good saves and had the crowds backing as usual, but sometimes looked nervous with the ball at his feet (like most keepers)

Guly was .... Guly. He gets a lot of stick at St. Marys. I feel it's time for him to move on soon if he wants to enjoy his career.

I thought Harrison Reid looked very good for his debut first team appearance(?). Think the other guy was Omar, didn't see to much of him.

Jay Rod was up for the game, but couldn't really create any clear cut opportunities.


Overall Saints were the better team in the first half but fairly lucky not to concede in the 2nd half. Saints second goal was a bit against the run of play.


This is just my opinion though, I'd like to hear how others compare.

But maybe that whole bit is there so they can knock it down with the figures at the bottom. 

The figures seem to speak for themselves, and jive with what we know about the state of the recovery in the UK; that we're doing comparatively badly with just about everywhere else in Europe. I know enough about France to know that it has its problems too, political AND economic, but it's always seemed to me that since the revolution France has just had this way of self-correcting when things go too badly wrong.

It was 0% of respondents, not 0% of British Muslims as you were saying. Given that only around 1000 Muslims were polled, the true value for all British Muslims (assuming an unbiased sample) is likely to be approximately or less than one-hundreth of a percent.

I would still complain about the statement '37% of British Muslims...' because it is not true. But the case of zero is even more important. By saying '0% of British Muslims...' you are saying that the statement is true of precisely zero British Muslims. Not a single one. It's not true for the Muslims you know at work, or the ones who run the local shop, or the ones you see on the street, or Mo Farah. It's not true for any of them. But the actual results allow for the possibility that there are tens of thousands of British Muslims for which it is true. That's a big difference, and will lead to a big difference in the way people perceive the Muslims they meet everyday.

&gt; The poll you are presenting does not counter the assertion that Muslims are homophobes. 

I would say it does, because we have to assume that the respondents know that homosexuality is not illegal and that same sex couples can enter into legal relationships that are almost entirely the same as those for different sex couples. Might not be perfect, by I can't imagine a homophobe would be proud of that.

&gt; As a gay guy, I would've answered no to it.

As would a homophobe. A typical 'yes' respondent would, I imagine, be someone accepting of homosexuality but with no personal stake in exactly what the laws are.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"For those people who don't think this is a big issue and only an exceptional case, please remember that *we only hear about the high profile cases*, where someone who was important enough for reporters to give a shit was detained.

&gt; [schedule 7 was used on 61,145 people in 2012-13](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23757133)

That's a lot of people being detained without access to legal representation. Perhaps they were all potential terrorists, but we don't know because schedule 7 allows detention without requiring any reason or explanation whatsoever, except when the person is important enough that the media picks it up and demands a reason, as in this case and Miranda's case.

&gt; The majority of those examinations lasted less than 15 minutes, and the Home Office says more than 97% of examinations last less than an hour.

Doesn't seem like a huge inconvenience right? What about if you're trying to catch a plane? A 15 minutes delay could mean a missed flight and too bad, you can't reschedule the flight or claim anything back for all the money you just lost on the plane ticket because you've already checked in but didn't show up at the gate.

These are my problems with this schedule 7. I understand the need for heightened security, and it could save lives if a terrorist is stopped in mid-plot. But there needs to be more consideration about reducing the chances for abuse and helping people who have been wrongly detained.

There needs to be some 3rd party representation for the person being detained. It doesn't have to be a family lawyer (who might also be a terrorist or whatever). It can be a completely unrelated 3rd party human rights lawyer from Amnesty International or something. The point is that someone needs to be there who isn't associated with the police or the government who can stop any abuse before it happens and advise the detainee on their rights under schedule 7 (assuming they still have any rights left).

There also needs to be a way for the detainee to claim compensation when the detention does not amount to any charges. This is so that if the detention cause them to miss a flight or a bus or a tour group assembly or whatever, they can get back the money that they lost on non-refundable tickets and bookings.

Finally, if some of your border guards are racist scum, which isn't a big leap for the imagination, then you're allowing them to waste time and resources on detaining, processing and interrogating about 60,000 innocent people every year just because they want to inconvenience them. It's a waste of government and police resources and it's a waste of plane tickets and jet fuel and airport resources. And it's pissing 60,000 people off for no reason. Is that a recipe for efficiency? I doubt it.

the contract was originally in my dad's name and so when he died all his accounts stopped which is natural, however, we provided orange with a death certificate which allowed us to keep the internet for the following year as we didn't decide to change over till summer this year 2013. it was changed into my sister's name and to come out of her bank account instead out our father's. this is when the trouble began.

we believed it had been transferred into my sister's name, but a year later when we go to cancel it, they tell us that it's still in his name and they had no copy of the death certificate. this is impossible as how would we have kept the internet if we hadn't sent it in the first place? this resulted in the operator calling my sister an idiot when they refused to speak to her as she wasn't the account holder.

the up-to-date situation is we changed to sky in august and ""cancelled"" our contract only to discover our internet and phone calls have been charged by orange and sky, resulting in orange taking over £70 from us. when we called asking for a refund, they said we'd only get about £18 of that back and they still haven't cancelled it as they have requested yet another death certificate to do so even after we sent a second one after the idiot incident.

i cancelled the direct debit this morning as it comes out of a joint account between me and my sister but i reckon they'll now get shirty because we won't be paying up when we have not been using their service for the last 2 months. but the issue now is we want a full refund for the money they shouldn't have taken, the contract cancelled and a bloody good apology for treating us so poorly in light of what the initial situation was - the death of our father and losing his death certificate multiple times.",0,1380106062,null,0,1380106288,0,ccf155j,t3_1n0wu0,t1_ccf155j,t3_1n0wu0,null,1429349388,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

Sky bought the TV rights for 116 live games.
BT sports bought the TV rights for 38 live games.
Sky owns the TV highlights rights.
News international (the Times, The Sun) owns the digital highlights rights.

Clubs have the right to show live game within their stadium (like in hospitality boxes) and has the right to show match highlights in digital once what we call ""the Club Digital Holdback"" is ended which is midnight on Sunday if the game is played on Friday and Saturday, or midnight on the day the match is played if not on Friday and Saturday.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"Yeah. This.

She was well-liked during the marriage to Charles, and had a considerable amount of sympathy during the divorce. However, she was seen as milking it in TV interviews and the way *it was reported* that she was seeing various men, James Hewitt, Will Carling, Bryan Adams etc - and then Dodi Fayed - she became tabloid fodder and was, and excuse the expression, heading for a bit of a trainwreck one way or another (inb4 someone FTFY to 'carwreck').

Charles was seen as the arsehole in the situation, having his thing with Camilla throughout, but he's perhaps been given some sympathy because he probably wanted to have been with her along and couldn't because she wasn't seen as 'suitable' royal princess material. 

After Diana's death, there was a lot of hate for a media that was seen as having killed her, but that fairly quickly turned into a conspiracy narrative that probably won't ever go away. That same media utterly saturated itself with reports of grieving in a way that a lot of people couldn't really relate to and some of the disdain you might see for her is  perhaps down to that, as /u/deer_dance above says. 

A fairly small but exceptionally dedicated corner of the public are still obsessed by her and her death and are routinely exploited by the Daily Express newspaper in a way that many see as ghoulish and unethical. Many others, especially younger people, don't care much either way.

I would suggest that the majority of people who were old enough to have seen it all's attitudes to her are along the lines of; that Diana did a lot of good charity work she should be credited for, Charles and her should never have been married and he should have fought harder to be with Camilla or married someone who genuinely didn't care, that she was a bit of a slapper and Harry probably isn't Charles' kid but James Hewitt's but that's not his fault and unless there's any actual danger of him succeeding to the throne it doesn't matter much, that her death was horrible and undeserved and *probably* the fault of the media, that the conspiracy theories are most likely complete bollocks, that it's all very sad and shit happens, but not so serious that we won't have a mildly guilty snicker over a distasteful joke.

Because minorities are mistreated in other countries, you feel it's appropriate for you to have a suspicious view of minorities in your country?

It depends on what circumstances brought you to live in that house. If the inhabitants of the house went around the world taking everything they could, enriching themselves at the expense of the other people's households, you might recognise it's just a consequence of that.

I have no less trust for the average Muslim than the average non-Muslim. The vast majority of them are moderates who are no different to atheists or Christians, and I absolutely do not buy the argument that a Muslim woman wearing a veil is somehow forcing their religion on *us*. 

However, I do feel British society would be better off without such division. I don't accept the view given here: ""An adviser on anti-Muslim hatred said the findings suggested young people needed to mix more."" Mixing is a nice idea in principle, but in reality it tends not to work. People of different cultures will stay within their own cultures. I don't think we have multiculturalism in this country, we simply have different cultures doing their own thing. Religion as a whole should be kept on a personal level and not grow to a political one, and it seems that conflicting religions here are harming Britain. I hate the whole ""go back to your own country"" view, because I think that's nonsense: however, there *should* be a certain degree of integration. I don't condemn a woman for choosing to wear the veil (though I condemn parents every time I see a child in a hijab), nor do I accept the view that it's not our place to have an opinion on their culture. 

I suppose what I'm getting at is that I'm between the left and the right. The left like to think there is no problem and that we're all getting along fine, and *we* need to bend to *their* culture, while the right exaggerate the problems and seem to think Britain should be completely white protestant, and that soon we're going to have Sharia Law for everyone.

Letting the proles vote was pretty much against the cultural norm, but that worked out ok for most of us.  You start by letting rich males over 21 vote, then allow any male over 21, then any males full stop, then finally women.

I'm not saying you have to accept all cultural requests, but I also don't think you can assume that our current cultural and social norms are immutably perfect and should never be challenged or changed.  Britain has always nicked the best of the stuff immigrants bring with them so it's to everyone's benefit if we do the same with current immigrants.

Loads! Not all of it exclusively muslim, and not all of it stuff we're not doing already.  But how about the approach to family and community support?  It's a different faith group but the Sikh community where I live came together to build an[ incredible Gurdwara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara_Sahib_Leamington_and_Warwick) without relying on state support to provide infrastructure.  Many muslim communities are much more mutually supportive than standard British communities.

Or how about the respect that elderly people receive in some immigrant communities?  Miles better than letting granny fade away in a care home 200 miles away.

You might need to untangle the specifically islamic aspects in some of these cases, e.g. if a community acts a certain way is it because they are muslim or is it because they come from north-west Pakistan; it could be that other muslims would reject some aspects, but as long as people are able to discuss this stuff openly society can gradually come to a consensus.",0,1380110079,null,0,false,0,ccf1nlu,t3_1n375m,t1_ccf1nlu,t1_ccf1git,null,1429349149,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Probably some exaggeration on your part there, but I presume you're talking about conservative leaning old folk. They're a dying breed and have little to no chance of making this happen. That's not necessarily true of British Muslims (a growing demographic with vocal aspirations for power/change - hence the worry).

Besides, we 'fixed' the issue via democratic process. Recently, a Gallup poll showed that of 500 British Muslims sampled, 0% thought gay relationships were acceptable. That's terrifying. 0%.

Nuclear weapons can kill lots of people but also ensure stability. If the world has become stable enough without them, there's a case to be made that there's no need for them.

Nuclear power can solve a lot of environmental problems, but there have been major nuclear accidents approximately every twenty years. It's more affordable than the equivalent energy from renewable sources, so again, there's a balance of benefits and risks to be considered.

The area needs some attention given to it, currently it is fairly neglected and has turned into a bit of a shithole (maybe not as bad as Camden or Brixton but certainly isn't far off).  To ""improve the area"" like it or not there has to be a a degree of change done and suggested changes are in fact relatively minor (though maybe not minor in the perspective of those in the council houses). 

I do think that they are trying to balance what they are doing, they may be adding some new flats but they are also putting in a new school, a new public square, a Sainsbury and upgrading the rail lines (though still no new Tube stop, which is very much needed).  It would seem they are trying to very much provide as much benefit to the area as they can. The knock-on effects unfortunately is the possibility of more of the population effectively being priced out of the area, but the improvements also stand to benefit those (through additional jobs, improving business, improved housing) to those whom remain in the area.  It seems that they are making as much an effort as they can to improve the area without ""sterilizing the culture"".  

Now the people in the council housing certainly have every right to be angry, i would like to see an effort to assist them finding new housing which seems like it would be a responsible thing to do. But the improvements in the area are desperately needed, and when you look at the effects this type of plan has had in a place like Manchester its hard to say that there won't potentially be a great deal of good that comes from this not only for the club but the entire area.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The trial had heard that the 49-year-old told police he ""clipped"" Mrs Fyfe's back wheel at a junction.

~~A driver should never be close enough behind a cyclists to ""clip"" their back wheel.  It scares me that this man will be back on the road at all, nevermind that'll he'll be behind the wheel again so soon.~~

~~The fact that he's gone on to kill a second cyclist through his reckless driving after having spent 2 years in jail for the first one should be in indication enough that 300 hours community service and a 5 year ban isn't going to be enough to get his act together.~~

edit: okay, having now read the [court papers](http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2013HCJAC114.html) it all seems much more reasonable.  While I still think Gary McCourt is responsible for her death, I don't think the punishment was unduly lenient.

[Here is an awful mspaint depiction of what I understand to have happened based on the court papers.](http://i.imgur.com/8unZOyb.jpg)

He was turning right up Crainentinny ave, stopped to let a bus coming the other way along Portobello rd go by, started to turn, then spotted mrs. fyfe following the bus, tried to swerve left and avoid her but clipped her back wheel (with the driver side, rear corner of his vehicle if I understand correctly).

&gt;At approximately 6:30pm on 9 August 2011 the respondent was driving a motor car westwards on Portobello Road, Edinburgh. The deceased, Mrs Audrey Fyfe, was riding a bicycle eastwards on Portobello Road. Although other eye witnesses were able to testify about the immediate aftermath, including Mrs Fyfe's fall, and although a police accident reconstruction expert drew certain inferences, the respondent was the only eye witness who was able to testify directly about the collision between his car and Mrs Fyfe's bicycle.

&gt;The respondent intended to turn right (approximately northwards) into Craigentinney Avenue, which joins Portobello Road on its north side. He testified that he, 'slowed down to a crawl or stopped' and 'slowed down, more or less stopped' at the junction, to allow an eastbound bus to pass by. In the course of the trial the Crown attempted to prove that no such bus passed the junction at the material time, but the evidence was inconclusive. I have no way of knowing whether or not the jury accepted that part of the respondent's testimony.

Other things worth noting here are:

&gt;[7] In assessing the seriousness of the offence, the sheriff had regard to the five factors listed at paragraph 8 of the Definitive Guideline, namely (1) awareness of risk, (2) effect of alcohol or drugs, (3) inappropriate speed of vehicle, (4) seriously culpable behaviour of offender, and (5) failing to have proper regard to vulnerable road users. The sheriff reached the view that only the fifth of these factors applied in the present case; Mrs Fyfe was a cyclist and therefore a vulnerable road user. He also held that the respondent's carelessness arose from momentary inattention. As a first step, he therefore placed the respondent's driving in the third (least serious) level of gravity in the table at page 15 of the Definitive Guideline.

and specifically in response to the appeal:

&gt;[13] The sheriff noted in response that the respondent was guilty of momentary inattention. The result was a low impact, low speed collision with the victim's cycle. A fatal outcome as a result of the degree of danger created by the quality of the respondent's driving was not reasonably foreseeable. Albeit that Mrs Fyfe was a vulnerable road user, he concluded that the quality of the respondent's driving was at the lowest end of the spectrum of carelessness. With regard to the prior conviction he observed that this was some 27 years ago when the respondent was 22 years old, and apart from a breach of the peace some 20 years ago he had not come to the attention of the authorities until now. Moreover, while the prior road traffic conviction could hardly be more serious, the respondent's driving in the present case was at the opposite end of the spectrum of gravity. The sheriff observed in his report:

&gt;""Had the quality of the respondent's driving been at the more serious end of the range of carelessness, I would have been entitled to infer that the respondent had not learned his lesson from the prior conviction, imprisonment and disqualification for ten years. But I was not able to do so. In the circumstances, I was not prepared to attach such weight to the prior conviction that imprisonment would have become inevitable in accordance with the sentencing guidelines.""

Remember, a majority of people supported war with Iraq, but the actual reality did not go down well. Essentially, just because people have a general sentiment that benefits need cutting, doesn't mean they will cheer specific policies if the impacts are seen to been punitive. 

People are also particularly likely to react against anything seen as punitive on people who are already working.

What does that even mean? I've not heard anyone ever say that. Unless ""christian morality"" means ""thou shalt not steal"" or something.

I've heard nutters say they'll burn in hell or something, but not that they believe they should harm gays themselves.

&gt; That and I truly doubt there are 'several million' muslims with these kind of views in the UK. Whenever the press has shown images of extremists doing protests they always have a close up shot of them to make it seem like there's loads of them - when there's usually about 10-30 people. Considering the quoted membership figures of some of the more extreme organisations combined are in the low hundreds, I'd have thought a better figure would be 'several thousand', at most.

Edit: As I've said elsewhere, the fixture list is pretty nice, with the majority of the other high flying teams not playing us until just before Xmas. Hopefully we'll have passed the 50% mark of the ~70 points we need to finish top 6, even with this strikeforce. However I agree, and I noted a while back that I can't see where goals are going to come from. Johnson will probably be good for a few when he plays, and he will hopefully be back reasonably soon, but I'd bet he'll rack up a maximum of 4 before he's sidelined again. I feel bad for Austin as the service has been so very, very poor. It's still early days for Phillips and Kranjcar, so maybe they can scrape a few each when they're in the rhythm of things. Fingers crossed Chevanton isn't standing on legs of fine china and has some decent goal nabbing instincts. They're wise to have only signed him until Xmas though.

It's all about the January window now. I would make a play for Nahki Wells from Bradford if they can afford him. Otherwise raid Coventry for some of their strike force.

true,pastpresentfuror,null,null,"We won't be much more dynamic going forward. The game plan is patient possession and opportunism. Our plan A is to have 55 - 60% possession, mostly in the center of the park, and utilize neat passing by the 3 attacking midfielders and/or fullback wing play to create chances.

The players have been told to shoot rather than go for passes they aren't 100% sure they can make in the final third and to recycle possession through the high defensive line rather than go for passes they aren't 100% sure they can make everywhere else. 

This is why you see a lot of backwards passing and a lot of shooting. The shooting causes defenses to have to make a choice between stepping up to close down and holding off to intercept passes (which is why our number 10s have had so much joy) and also eradicates most opposition counter attacking chances (which is why we have had so few chances against us).

This is a team that is really about being more than the sum of its parts: players creating space with off the ball movement, the midfield anchors filling in for full backs when they are heavily involved in attacking, the keeper really controlling his area.

The one thing I would like to see more of is Soldado staying in the danger area. I think AVB has really wanted him involved to get used to the very unique pace and movement of the premier league, but he needs to not be collecting balls on the wide edges of the penalty box. That is the only reason he has not scored in every game he's played.

I'm particularly worried about the teams that are managed by more tactically astute coaches (Mourinho, Wenger, Pellegrini, Martinez), because there are very effective (but hard to implement) counter measures to our style of play.

But aside from that, resources in a number of areas are declining - water, for instance (which also massively impacts food, since we drink 4 litres a day, but eat 2000 litres).  Fossil (non-replenishable) aquifiers are falling in many countries with large populations, e.g. the North China Plain, this in turn is leading to declining wheat harvests (from 123 million tons to 95 million between 1997 and 2005) and those of rice (from 140 million tons to 127 million).  China now has to import.  Other countries from the US to Iran to India have serious issues with their water tables.  Saudi has gone through half its fossil water reserves.  Yemen is close to pumping the wells which feed its capital city (2 million pop.) dry.  Aside from irrigation, temperature rises are screwing crop yields too.

Our planet's forest cover has shrunk from 5 billion hectares to 3.9 billion, concentrated in the developing world.  Aside from CO^2, flora/fauna, soil erosion, medical potential, etc., just consider Haiti (on the left) [from a satellite](http://www.earthsangha.org/images/displays/haerial.jpg) and there's no longer any mystery why tropical storms there are so devastating and loss of life so high.  But soil erosion is also another major issue leading to food scarcity and is taking a toll across the world.  Grazing lands are going and deserts are taking over.

90% of the large species sea fish have gone over the last 50 years - that's not in some small overfished region, but across the entire planet.  When fisheries fail completely, in most cases they don't come back (at least not for a very long time).  Bluefin tuna numbers are at 6%.  Coral reefs are in serious decline as are mangrove swamps, both of which are essential niches.   Water acidity is rising to levels which will not sustain much life. 12% of birds, 23% of mammals, and 46% of fish species are ""vulnerable or in danger of extinction"".  Etc. etc.

The monster was some sort of mind-controlling girl, but she was the last of her kind so her mind-controlling stuff wasn't working properly and she was just reading other peoples' minds rather than controlling them. Also, if she read their mind too long, then it transferred to them who could then read other peoples' minds and transfer it to them too. 

So the Doctor had to stop the human race from evolving into mind readers. Funny actually because it was Ten, and I've always preferred Nine!

Look at [Frequent Trader](http://www.clubfinance.co.uk/FrequentTrader/Frequent-Trader.php) from Club Finance, that's who I use.  

Commission is a good way to make you think about your trades though, why did you buy BDEV and ASC? The former is a building firm close to their 52 week high in what could be another bubble with a 0.78% yield, the second was at the year high and pays no dividends.  

Not saying either was a bad buy, but why did you buy and why last week? And what has changed (apart from the share price) that made you think it's now time to sell? Essentially you're asking if you should buy high and sell low, consider that. Don't let panic ruin your portfolio, and I'd even suggest not buying more until you've read a little more.  

&gt; i guess its a good idea to diversify slowly. i intend to top up the cash a minimum of £100 a month and buy £600 of something every 6 months. but at that rate it'd take me 7 years to become diverse with 20 stocks at 5% weight each.

You're trying to avoid specific stock risk by diversifying at a cost of 2.5% loss per trade. You've got £4,000, if you have all of that in one company it costs 0.84% per buy/sell. If you have it in 10 companies it costs you 4% per buy/sell (remember you incur the commission again selling). Diversifying is good, but not if it costs you more than the risk you take by sticking with one company. What's so special about 20 companies that's worth 20x the commission?  

Diversifying is good, but you don't have enough invested at those commission rates for it to be worth being your priority.

That being said I think it dances around something that could be studied further which is Premier League penetration in non-domestic (English/Welsh) markets - specifically North America but also burgeoning areas like Asia, and Africa.

Bennett seemed to move from looking at American Premier League allegiances to 'footy-tags' which don't seem to track allegiance at all. It's more like an expansion of the flash card game Jason Sudekis plays in that NBC bit where he's the manager of Spurs, or a Rorschach test with club crests.

It doesn't really answer the fundamental question of why do people outside of London, Manchester, Liverpool, etc... support one team and not another. Why Chelsea and not Fulham, why Liverpool and not Everton, why Manchester United and not Bolton Wanderers?

Generally and anecdotally speaking I've found Europeans to be quick on the automatic assumption that non-European's support historically/contemporary successful teams as part of bandwagon mentality. But, I think that's too easy - granted it might be the case sometimes but I still think it's too general.

What causes some teams to penetrate better into foreign markets, what makes them successful at attracting foreign fans, what causes PL fandom for one team and not another outside of England? I think it has to be more than just success vs. lack thereof.

Having said that however, we generally tend to raise our game when playing other top four clubs.  Our results against comparatively weaker opposition last season was much worse... I think that's because we traditionally have more trouble breaking down teams that park the bus than teams that attempt to attack us.

I agree with you about Soldado, although the Cardiff game was encouraging in my eyes.  He had three big moments to score - one where he chested it down and had his shot partially blocked, one where he was perfectly placed to shoot Siggy's crossbar rebound (just hit it instinctually, straight at the keeper), and one close range volley where he got behind the defence (marginally offside, and also straight at the keeper).

All three moments presented him with the kind of service he's been lacking, and saw him finding space behind the CBs inside the box.

I've heard/read comparisons between what Mourinho wants from Mata, and what he wanted from Joe Cole. I'd like to point out that Joe Cole has never been half the player Juan Mata is. I don't wanna be the stats guy but his 32 goals and 58 assists in two seasons (35 assists last season) mean that he's involved in nigh on as many goals as Messi and Ronaldo - [source](http://www.caughtoffside.com/2013/06/22/caughtoffsides-top-50-footballers-in-the-world-11-juan-mata-chelsea-spain/). As a lover of the club, I, like many Chelsea fans, have come to see Mata as the natural heir to Gianfranco, his sublime technique and sharp football brain make him an absolute joy to watch - I've witnessed him do things which would leave Zola himself perplexed. It unfortunately seems to me that José's blagging his way through at the moment as he does not know his best XI; I'd have been willing to bet at the start of the season that most Chelsea fans could have named the most important 3 of whatever that XI may be - Oscar, Hazard, Mata. The three amigos were the most exciting thing about the Premier League. Of course, he should be allowed time, and I'm far from dismissive of the tactical nous of who is probably the best manager in the world right now. I am, however, becoming increasingly critical of Mourinho's motives for not starting Juan Mata. Could it all just be his ego? He stopped playing Real Madrid fan favourite Iker Casillas, widely acknowledged as the best keeper in the world. Is it all to assert that nobody is more important than he is at the club? Mourinho stating that he wants Mata to be a player that honours his defensive duty doesn't quite wash, but then again José has always been far more concerned with not conceding goals than scoring them. I hope Mata, who'll have one eye on the World Cup, can 'adapt' for José, because it's bloody clear that José is not going to adapt for him.

Your whole argument seems to be based on this whole ""hey lets get to know eachother first"" bit. That may be a utopian and perfect way of looking at things but it's certainly not realistic. Now.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I agree, i think Lamela can have a profound effect on the attck.

Andros is getting criticized for shooting so much (a somewhat valid point) but when you look at it teams are stepping back when he cuts inside and taking away passing opportunities and leaving the shot open.  Last couple times out it looks like Andros has shown signs of looking to create an opportunity on the pass.

Lamela is at the moment a much more balanced player who can really force the issue for defenders and can hurt them with either a shot or the pass (as well as beat a defender 1x1).  Pair that with Eriksen's playmaking and Soldado's ability and the attack starts to look a bit more potent.

So far we have been much more deliberate in how we move in attack, i think as the players start to settle in and we will start seeing more of the attack style that AVB had at Porto which was based more on quickly moving up the field and forcing the defense to react to a more fluid and aggressive attack.  I am not sure that we will quite get to the Dynamic attack that we would all want this season but i think we will begin seeing many more signs of it with intermingled with our possession based attack.

I know it's disgusting. I'm going to endeavour to do it less. I only do it when I'm hung over really. I will endeavour to get a tissue whenever I can. If I don't have one to hand, that shit's going on the floor. I'm not swallowing it. And if I'm running, I'm not spitting into a tissue.

On a hygienic level, I'm not really sure it is that bad. Just been googling now. Singing, coughing and sneezing are all more unhygienic apparently, because they draw from the respiratory tract, where infections lie. I think the problem with spitting is more superficial; it is very unsightly I agree. And it sounds vile. But I'm not surely it really is a health issue. If people were happy to admit that it's not a hygiene issue, they just don't like it, well, I'd still definitely tell them to fuck off. But the whole moral high ground just seems a bit shaky to me, when people are arguing that it's a health issue, because it's not really true, and here you are, telling someone they're a dick, based on something not necessarily true. To start insulting someone based on something not necessarily true, is much more of a personality flaw than spitting IMO.

Lovely to see Clichy and Richards put in a full 90 mins. Will be interesting to see who Pellegrini plays against Bayern at RB and LB.

Boyata looked pretty good as well. Did make 1 or 2 passes which got intercepted but recovered well. Very mobile.

Milner was great as well. Not surprising, the guy has infinite stamina, the part where he outran the Wigan defender to assist Jovetic's goal after running so much for 80 odd minutes was insane.

Lopes was brilliant. Unlucky to not get on the score-sheet. Looks like a hybrid version of Silva and Tevez. Should start all league cup games and some FA Cup ones.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; But the point is, she's not in trouble for protesting, she'd in trouble for blocking the road.

I believe she's in trouble for both.

From the article:

&gt; The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the Brighton Pavilion MP faced **one count under the Public Order Act** and **one of obstructing a highway**.

The breach of the Public Order Act was (as I understand it) attending an ""illegal"" peaceful protest that wasn't properly sanctioned by the police.

If the peaceful protest had been a ""legal"" one then she wouldn't have been breaking the first law.  Nor is it likely that the police would arrest her for obstructing the highway as peaceful protests often obstruct highways and disrupt other public areas (such is the cost of living in a free society).  That said, I agree with your point that being on a ""peaceful protest"" doesn't necessarily give you the right to block the highway, etc.

So the point I was making was that she probably wouldn't have been breaking any laws if the police had allowed the peaceful protest to go ahead.  I'm not saying she was right to go ahead and protest anyway, but I'm very cautious about the police (and government) having the right to decide what people are and aren't allowed to protest about.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;It unfortunately seems to me that José's blagging his way through at the moment as he does not know his best XI

It's September. Don't forget that the side we started with at the beginning of 2004/5 had a midfield diamond (Geremi-Makelele-Lampard-Smertin) and you'd be hard pressed to argue that this was Jose's best XI for the rest of the season or that he was ""blagging it"". The idea of a ""best XI"" is a fallacy anyway. Any decent side has a number of options to suit the opposition.

&gt;I am, however, becoming increasingly critical of Mourinho's motives for not starting Juan Mata. Could it all just be his ego? He stopped playing Real Madrid fan favourite Iker Casillas, widely acknowledged as the best keeper in the world

The same Iker Casillas that is still on the bench under a different manager? Best in the world my arse. The ""ego"" angle doesn't play either. Mata causes zero problems in the dressing room. He's by all accounts a top bloke. Quite why Jose would want to assert his authority in this way is beyond me.

The most striking thing about the hand-wringing over Mata is the almost complete inability for people to think that it might be a football-related decision. And it is, quite obviously.

&gt;Mourinho stating that he wants Mata to be a player that honours his defensive duty doesn't quite wash

Except that it does? One of the things that has always struck me about Mata is that he is extraordinarily slow and does very little defensive work. Sure, you can excuse that when the attacking output is as good as his has been for the last two years but Jose's issue is clearly Mata's place within the team. When you have three players in the attacking third who can press continuously it helps your defence out to no end. We haven't got 25 year old JT or Carvalho or Gallas anymore. Our defence cannot be relied upon so we have to adapt the gameplan to suit them.

In Mata's last two seasons we've finished sixth and third. Not good enough. Too many times we've been a pushover. Not good enough. The last two seasons have been masked by somehow winning the European Cup. For however entertaining Amsterdam was, the Europa League is a competition we should not have been in. Obviously I'm not saying that it's Mata's fault, because it's not. He's brilliant. But he's brilliant in one system that has, time and again, left us wide open on the counter attack. It's the late-AVB, RDM, Benitez system that got the best out of Mata but also made us a soft touch at the back.

Overall, Jose&gt;Mata. Yes Mata's brilliant, but given the choice between the two, I'm afraid it's Jose all day long. Jose is the best manager in the world. Juan Mata is nowhere near being the best player in the world.",0,1380126263,null,0,false,0,ccf68ui,t3_1n3ses,t1_ccf68ui,t1_ccf4s4r,null,1429347006,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12

For instance most christians agree that children shouldn't, under any circumstance, be stoned to death in the street. That's the extreme example but there are also more subtle ones.

true,MotoGoLoco,UnionFlag,We are Biker Friendly,"No worries, here's a first batch to get you started:

**Create, save and export a route straight onto your GPS**
- Garmin &amp;
- TomTom

Both of these should be straightforward, almost all others have GPX/ITN/etc files available for export.

**Crowd sourced biking road / route ratings**
- Trying to define the 'perfect' biking road is just too subjective - we've surveyed hundreds of different riders over the last year while we've been working on this, and we've yet to come up with an infallible set of results. 

What someone riding a Harley describes as perfect (stereotypically long straight roads) is very different to what a sportsbike rider wants (fast, sweeping bends) compared to an adventure rider who doesn't mind a bit of gravel if the scenery's good. Hence, we've come up with this:

When creating &amp; saving your routes, you have a series of grading options that help describe &amp; define it for others, namely:

The type(s) of bike you think it's suitable for: (Sports/Tourers/Cruisers/Adventures) -&amp;- a set of sliders to help describe it, being:

- Straight&lt;-----&gt;Twisty
- Urban&lt;-----&gt;Rural
- Low Traffic&lt;-----&gt;Busy Traffic.

From here, you can at least get a feel for the road/route based on how it's been described, and you can decide whether it sounds like fun (to you) or not.


**Layers...  You can toggle a whole load of cool stuff on/off, including:**

- Biker-friendly accommodation
- Iconic Rides (we'll be building these up over time)
- Classic Routes - these are a collection of classic biking roads, think 'Hartside', 'St Mary's Loch', Hawes to Sedburgh' kinda thing. Again, we're working on these just now.
- Top 20 user submitted routes - we've built a 'Reddit-esque' voting system, allowing you to upvote / downvote a route as you see fit. The current top 20 are listed here, and is live to the minute.
- My Private Routes - lets you create a set of routes that you DON'T want to be made public (e.g. - from your home postcode... don't tell bike thieves where your SV is kept overnight!!).


**Add pictures to your route(s)**
- When you save a route, you can add up to 10 accompanying photos. These can be anything from cool backdrops you'll pass, POI's, the front door of the hotel you're staying at, weird / key junctions...


**The ability to tweak the route on the fly without too much complexity**
- ""Oooh, look wiggly mountain road [click and drag, job done]"" - you can add any existing route (user submitted/iconic etc) to your route by clicking it and adding it to your route. Easy!

As per Google Maps, you can also bend &amp; drag routes like a good'un to your hearts content.
- (Side note - it's amazing how many people didn't know you can grab and drag a route by the way...)

Any good for starters?

* Young people place the blame for Islamophobia in Britain on terror groups abroad (26%), the media (23%) and UK Muslims who have committed acts of terror (21%)
* Only three in 10 (29%) think Muslims are doing enough to combat extremism in their communities. However, overall young people are more likely to agree (48%) than disagree (27%) that Islam is a peaceful religion

true,Uniform_Code,null,null,"I can re-enforce what has already been said here. Canadians can try and land a SSHRC or a Commonwealth fellowship before going. However, the Commonwealth scholarship is down to 1 or 2 for the entire country and SSHRC is a complete gamble. 

For Oxford, there is the aforementioned Clarendon which is open to all graduate applicants and each division of the university has a quota they are allowed. Odds of landing it are also very small. Criteria is almost entierly grades, they don't look beyond that. 

The colleges have some funding but nothing close to subsistance. You may get some teaching pay, if they let you teach, and there is room, but again it's tiny. 

Unfortunately, if you follow the 'don't go if you aren't fully funded' advice, which is what everyone will tell you, you are pretty much out of luck going anywhere outside Canada. Also, remember that you can't work more than a few hours a month as a condition of your Oxford student status (that's indipendant of your limits on the student visa). 

Finally, remember that all of these funding opportunities have very advanced application deadlines. Canadians need to submit University applications by November the year before they want to go (so if you want 2014 entry you need to start the application now). SSHRC applications are due in early November. Canadian Commonwealth scholarships are usually due in early October (but they have a bad habit of leaving it to the last minute). And, don't trust the Oxford funding search system, it misses most of the faculty scholarships. Search those pages carefully and, at a last resort, e-mail the faculty graduate office to double check.

* You can't blame our poor league finishes in past 2 years on Mata, without him we would've been fucked, especially last season

* Mata may not be close to being 'the best in the world' but he is close to being **our** best player. 

It is a tricky situation because I don't believe that Mourinho has a hidden problem with Mata, but I also can't get my head around the idea that in footballing terms Mata weakens any team. You can't have every player with brilliant technique and physical ability (eg. Ramires who will run all day but can't hit a fucking 20 yard pass properly). Lampard isn't quick enough or strong enough positionally to justify a holding midfield role, but his all round quality gets him a place in the team.

If Oscar had been our number 10 last year and the shoe was on the other foot then maybe the Mata case would make more sense, but we have a player who shone in the league last season now sitting out the league games. I think the inherent problem is that the 'number 10' position isn't one where you normally have much variation as it is often occupied by one of the teams best players. I'd be less worried about Mata if I believed he could be turned into a right winger and brought back into the team, but can anyone honestly see him a) wanting to play on the wing or b) being effective enough in that role. If Mata's lack of pace is such an issue, it will surely be accentuated if he plays out wide.

But let's not be pedantic, teams have 'best' players in each position, my point is merely that Mourinho appears not to know who fits best where. That Iker Casillas is still on the bench under a different manager surely only shows the detrimental effects of sidelining talented players. As for Casillas not being the best keeper in the world: that is your opinion, indeed, that he is the best keeper in the world is only opinion, it is just one that has been backed up by his winning the 'best goalkeeper in the world' award 5 years running [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFFHS_World's_Best_Goalkeeper) - the most of any keeper since the inception of the award. When I discuss ego, I mean Mourinho's not Juan Mata's, I fear that Mourinho's assertion is that no matter how instrumental a player, he is the most important person at the club. I will agree that Mata's defensive work has never been top quality, however, it is not the traditional duty of the playmaking attacker to defend. Our defensive shortcomings in recent seasons can be more attributed to a lack of a robust anchor in midfield, a signing we should have made this summer. The idea that we should sacrifice our best player because our defence needs shoring up is ridiculous.

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I disagree. Ed Miliband is right and he has just won my vote with this policy. The cost of living has skyrocketed and we can't rely wholly on the taxpayer to continue footing the bill.

Ed Miliband has answered the economic question of Britain's turmoil with the proposal of a third method, regulation in order to stop living costs from further skyrocketing at the hands of corporate greed. Gordon Brown stated in 2010 during his election campaign that we shouldn't be introducing spending cuts nor changing the tax system because that would damage the recovery. When David Cameron was elected, cut everything, gave the rich tax breaks and upped VAT by 5%, what happened? A double-dip recession where we teetered on the edge of a triple-dip recession. We should have spent our way out of recession and then worried about our deficit, not the other way around.

Ed Miliband attempted to keep his own mouth shut. What happened? Everybody called him a weak leader and believed that he didn't have the balls to become Prime Minister. He *could* have just sat back and watched as the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives continued to commit what seemed like political harakiri but you know how much influence the media has, right?

Gordon Brown was a really good chancellor and a surprisingly decent prime minister in his three years of power who nobody warmed to because they and the media think it's about charisma and your public image as opposed to having the answer. Even despite Jacqui Smith trying to introduce censorship and web snooping policies, I still think Gordon Brown had the answers and was correct in his assumptions.

Haven't the big energy companies been reported to make record profits anyway? How would a prize freeze cause blackouts when it's likely due to an oligopoly of utility companies seemingly abusing the market for monetary gain?

Here's some sources for you from many different media outlets:

* [The Daily Mail accused energy companies of 'rigging the market' and overcharging by £600,000,000.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191946/Energy-companies-rigging-market-overcharging-600m-costing-British-household-extra-25.html)
* [ITV have reported that energy companes are losing trust because of the disgusting amount of profits they make from marking up their prices, something the industry defends by arguing that the extra profits go into future investment into infrastructure.](http://www.itv.com/news/story/2013-07-29/energy-profits-eroding-trust/)
* [British Gas made record profits of £742,000,000 in 2010. Consider the fact they had around 16,000,000 accounts and this figure is just from profits.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/24/british-gas-profits-centrica-competition-commission)
* [The Independent have called for an inquiry into how energy company profit margins have soared in recent years, suspecting price fixing.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boiling-point-calls-for-inquiry-into-alleged-profiteering-of-energy-giants-784918.html)

* [BBC News have stated that British Gas's profits have soared by 58% in 2008. Clearly the industry isn't doing so bad if a major firm can more than double their profits.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8535850.stm)

An online comic made a joke containing the word ""rape"" (not even about rape, just containing the word) a few years ago. Some people complained because they thought it was in poor taste, so they make a t-shirt referencing the joke as a way of sticking two fingers up. All seems fairly rational.

But then a year later they retract the shirts and issue an apology. Why? Were people seriously complaining for a whole year because a man on the internet said something they didn't like? Why did Penny Arcade pay them the slightest bit of attention?

So now at a conference, one of the people involved says, in response to a question, that they regret withdrawing the shirts. I can understand this -it seems to me he probably thought it was ridiculous apologising over something relatively trivial so long after the fact, and wished he'd just ignored him.

What's so bad about that? Why are so many people kicking up a fuss, including relatively influential people such as major stall holders and a bloke from BioWare? Have they all taken leave of their senses?

And what the fuck are ""pro-women policies"", anyway?! Allowing them to purchase a ticket? Not openly harassing them? At what point does it diverge from ""basic human decency"" and need to be given a special name?

This whole thing makes my head hurt, everyone involved seems to be completely retarded.

Thanks for linking to TumblrInAction, I'd forgotten about that sub. It's so refreshing finding out you're not the only one that thinks it's all utter insanity.

Honestly, I just cannot think of an American actor that ""FITS"" for me. I've seen some great names thrown out, several have made me go ""hmmmmmmmm"", but only Nathan Fillion really caught my attention. 
I guess the reason I don't think an American actor would do is because it's a British show, a British creation. To put an American actor in the role of the Doctor would just, I don't know, pervert it somehow, it wouldn't seem ""right"" to me. 
I live in the US, sure I've visited overseas but I'm American &amp; I LIVE for my BBCAMERICA. I love the majority of the shows I see on BBCA &amp; like many of you, I love them because they are SO DIFFERENT than anything on American television. If an American actor were to be ""The Doctor"" it seems like they'd have to take it a step further &amp; Americanize the show more for it to make sense. I don't want that. I'm sure the people of Britain don't want it either. 
I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it &amp; right now Doctor Who is as close to perfect as I've ever seen in ANY series, why mess with that? 
Too many things could go horribly wrong if The Doctor were to be cast by an American actor. I also think the Doctor should stay male, I'm a woman &amp; I have ZERO interest in the Doctor regenerating into a woman. 

So I wasn't being mean, or saying ""American actors suck balls"", I just think there's not really any need for an American actor in that role.

&gt;Everyone in Britain should learn 1,000 words of another language, a new campaign is urging, amid concerns that people lose out on jobs abroad because of poor language skills.

Firstly, who is 'everyone'? Are we talking about changes to the school curriculum, or a campaign to get Brits of all ages (regardless of whether they ever want to work abroad) to learn 1,000 words of any foreign language?

Secondly, who are these people losing out to jobs abroad? How many people apply for jobs abroad compared to the number of people applying domestically? 

Thirdly, the vast majority of the 5 million or so British expats live in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa and Canada. What incentives, financial or otherwise, are there for people to work abroad in non-English speaking countries? 

&gt;The Speak to the Future funded initiative argues that British tourists travelling abroad would receive a much warmer reception as ""we would appear less arrogant and better able to put forward our ideas on the international stage"".

What does that have to do with the price of fish? And what relation does a Midlander 'appearing less arrogant' in a bar in Spain have to do with 'putting forward our ideas on the international stage'?

&gt;According to the campaign, a vocabulary of 1,000 words would allow a speaker to conduct a basic conversation in their chosen language.

Haha no. *Learning a language* will allow a speaker to conduct a basic conversation, the way we've done it for thousands of years. Learning 1,000 random words is needlessly time-consuming and ultimately useless, unless we just want to say a load of nonsensical stuff to our baffled European counterparts.

true,mogifax,null,null,"While I agree with you about parental involvement, I can throw in a bit of a counter-argument.  As someone who grew up in the USSR and had zero access to most things you westerners consider ubiquitous, including game consoles, bubble gum, jeans, electric guitars, and nudie mags, *the mere fact of not having those things* made our childhood more ... wholesome, I guess.  Similarly, the mere fact of having porn and violent games around makes the experience of growing up for modern kids somewhat ... tainted, I suppose is the word.

Using your logic of parental involvement, every parent everywhere should NEVER leave their children unattended, never go on vacations, never leave kids with a sitter, never allow kids to visit their friends' houses, and always follow them around in school.  Basically, everyone should be a perfect helicopter parent just because violence and porn exist.  After all, every kid interested in shooting cops, soliciting hookers, and tackling grandmas in the newest GTA WILL FIND A WAY TO PLAY THE GAME, and there's nothing even the most oppressive parents can do.  Same goes for porn.  Just because it's there, kids will find a way to watch it.

It's a societal catch-22.  I firmly believe we as a society were better before pornstars became celebrities and household names.  Clearly porn always existed, but previously, girls like Jenna Jameson and Sasha Grey were just considered disgusting whores and nothing more.  But you can't outlaw it just because it can be easily accessed by anyone.

In the end, parents can only LIMIT access, not prevent it.  So most of the responsibility is on the parent, but let's be real -- the crazy proliferation of porn and violence is not exactly the fault of the parents, either.",0,1380131804,null,0,1380149566,0,ccf8fmx,t3_1n0xxi,t1_ccf8fmx,t1_ccf4va5,null,1429345914,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

I don't know how often I can keep saying this.  Protests are not regulated.  Shutting down the roads is.  You don't have to get the government to allow you to shout a bit.  You don't have to ask in advance, you don't have to declare a route, as long as you don't break the law.

&gt;But the same people who ignore peaceful protesters and drive on by with their lives unchanged 

... and why not?  Are all positions equally valid?  If you're protesting, does that automatically mean people should be convinced?

(as an aside, ""people don't care about my opinion so I'm going to break the law so I can shove it in their faces"" isn't good strategy, regardless)

You seem to have the idea that protest automatically means you have to annoy people.  It really doesn't.  Political protests have the twin aims of convincing politicians that this in an important opinion because a lot of people are deeply committed to it, and raising awareness of the issue to try to convince more people to share the opinion.  That doesn't require stopping traffic.

Some people do say protest is best accomplished via civil disobedience (because it gets the issue into the public eye).  That's good for them, but it doesn't suddenly mean that the protest *excuses* the civil disobedience, just that the people protesting think it's worth the sacrifice.  It's not a get out of jail (or fine) card.",0,1380132412,null,0,false,0,ccf8oe2,t3_1n3kwd,t1_ccf8oe2,t1_ccf8c1l,null,1429345802,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;I don't know how often I can keep saying this. Protests are not regulated. Shutting down the roads is. You don't have to get the government to allow you to shout a bit. You don't have to ask in advance, you don't have to declare a route, as long as you don't break the law.

What the law says:

&gt;By law you must tell the police in writing 6 days before a public march if you’re the organiser.

https://www.gov.uk/protests-and-marches-letting-the-police-know

So you're half-right half-wrong.

&gt;If you're protesting, does that automatically mean people should be convinced?

No, but you have a far greater chance of making people aware of your viewpoint and cause if they can't just drive past for work.

&gt;Political protests have the twin aims of convincing politicians that this in an important opinion because a lot of people are deeply committed to it, and raising awareness of the issue to try to convince more people to share the opinion. That doesn't require stopping traffic.

The Iraq protests were some of the largest in Britain's history. Look how much good they did.

&gt;That's good for them, but it doesn't suddenly mean that the protest excuses the civil disobedience, just that the people protesting think it's worth the sacrifice. It's not a get out of jail (or fine) card.

I agree and count myself among those who say what you said, but I don't believe it's in the public's interest for Lucas to be prosecuted.

No, but they kill people prematurely. If the idea is safety then it would be better to invest resources there. They are not inevitable, they are structurally produced. Improved access to cheap quality food and affordable fitness centres would put a dent in heart disease whilst Sweden introduced various traffic calming measures and reduced crashes by nearly 70%. Too lazy to link, sorry. 

Yes we do spend some money on research, but it is pitiful compared to the war machine from trident to iraq, afghanistan, mass worldwide surveillance, holding human rights workers, aircraft carriers without planes, intimidating journalists and the rest. The US budget in particular could revolutionise the world very quickly if was used well. 

Precisely. People protect themselves and the industry and the professionals will seek to project a problem for their own survival. I'd merrily support retraining all of our army to genuine peace officers there to support community cohesion and humanitarian relief. Train a war machine and there are huge vested interests, as well as temptations, to use the damn thing. Standing armies almost always create wars. 

That's what we had. Before the last few governments destroyed our pretty good collection of civil liberties. Now we need a permit to protest, can be held for 28 days without charge, can be searched without suspision under the terrorism act, house arrest, barring of political association, it goes on. 

We had pretty close to that and we've already given up something for a danger which is really quite miniscule. You are more likely to be smashed in the face by a random piece of tree than you are a victim of terrorism. You don't make anyone safe by killing civil liberties, they are the very things that keep us safe. Those who trade liberty for safety and all that.

If you're away for a weekend, are you sitting there wishing you were back at home so you could jack off to some chick getting plowed in the ass? I doubt it.

When you don't get a chance to watch it, do you start getting irritable and/or uneasy? Probably not.

Do you avidly avoid going out and doing things for the sake of staying home and watching porn? Unlikely.

Addiction is when you are pretty much dependent on something. You can't do your crack? Now you have a migraine and can't stop thinking about it. But just because you do something daily doesn't mean you're ""addicted"" to it. We have a lot of things we do daily that aren't considered ""addictions."" People can pretty easily not watch porn, there's no mental dependency on it. We just enjoy it because it's there. We go through our days normally, and maybe at one point we get the urge to go jack off to some porn, so we do. And that's it. I won't get a headache if I don't have a wank, I won't have a mental breakdown in public because I couldn't watch porn. But I'd like to have the option available if I've got some free time and an internet connection.
