The overall Tory welfare rhetoric is also particularly irritating because they're lying; creating another ""us and them"" situation by labelling everyone in receipt of benefits as lazy scroungers, despite the majority of the people being in work, the majority of people affected by this being disabled and the majority of the budget being pensions.

So in essence, this won't solve any of the problems you suggest, it will simply punish the poor to pay for the rich. That's not a left-wing hippy position; it is fact and that's why there's outrage.

It makes perfect sense to me.

Whatever else he's done, Assange leaked those cables, and whatever else he could, because he wanted to make the world a better place. See justice done, and stuff like this.

Many people, including myself, think that our democracy is broken - that the invasion of Iraq, for instance, was illegal.

You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to think what I've just said.

I suppose conspiracy theorists are going to desire leaked secrets and they're going to adulate someone who ""stands up"" for freedom by leaking state secrets.

Nevertheless, Assange was previously a hero to plenty of people - to plenty of people who think that the invasion of Iraq was illegal, that think governments do nefarious things all the time, and that it's wrong that they get away with it.

So there's cognitive dissonance to all those people if they accept that he did the crime - he can't be an hero and a rapist both at the same time!

So if you're looking to run OS 9 native for some reason I guess you'd be out of luck.

It's in reasonable condition (lots of scratches on the side/back, but the screen and inner area are in pretty good nick). The power cable is somewhat dodgy however. I bought it from a previous owner a year or so ago and haven't really done much with it.
By extension I'm not sure what state the battery's in - it seems extremely slow to charge, but I'm not sure if this is due to the power cable.

Kind of similar with Showbiz &amp; A.G., they were part of a loose group called D.I.T.C which included people like Fat Joe, Big L and Lord Finesse, more important people in hip-hop in the early/mid 90's.

Danny Brown is kind of new on the hip-hop scene but is gaining steady popularity and is collabing and featuring with lots of other more recognized/radio viable artists. His album 'XXX' was released for free and was basically called the dogs bollocks by every fucker going. He's playing at Park Life here in Manchester in the summer and I basically bought tickets to see him and a few other hip-hop artists like Action Bronson and Joey Basa$$.

The CineMatic Orchestra are a jazzy/electronic band...thing who do a whole host of different sounding albums. Odessa is from their album 'Man with a Movie Camera' which is from their original live score for the silent film of the same name (their score was released as an album). Excellent stuff.

Air are a French electronic duo. Lots of synths but also a nice bit of psychedelic stuff as well. All of their albums sound different I think, which I like. This is from their fourth 'Talkie Walkie', which is kind of smooth and mellow, but also a bit moody and soulful. Hard to describe I get, but the song does a good job anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'm Derby born and bred and I don't even know what snap backs are.

Those stupid fucking hats with the adjustable parts at the back that ""snap"" it's mainly with slogans like ""YOLO"" on them, or American sports teams that the wearer has never heard of.

Another thing that pisses me off about Derby is how superficial most people are in my age range, it seems a LOT of people I know from college want to be ""facebook famous"" and have 5000 friends on facebook when they know around 100 of them in person and constantly post status updates such as ""like this if you want a like on your profile picture xoxoxoxoxox""  or ""like this for 'hot or not'"" and then there is inevitably some average looking lad or lass who clicks like and they're fucking soul crushingly cunty to him or her whilst posting to all the popular people 'omg bb u r like 10/10 zomg soo bootiful""

I deleted just about everyone from Derby on facebook who I know apart from a couple of girls and a hand full of lads, most who are Eastern European.

I know it's only us being young and dumb, but they were also extremely hateful, telling people who they didn't get on with to ""Die in a fire"" for no reason other than if they talked to them and often girls from college would bait a guy into talking to them and pretend to like him so they could screencap it and post logs publically to humiliate him.

Ah I don't mind being 18, I'm making a bigger deal on here than I actually feel ""IRL"" about those mugs because it's late and I'm bored, felt like having a good old winge about something that used to wind me up.

I don't know how or why but I can drink ungodly amounts of vodka when combined with redbull, it's like drinking some kind of magical elixr. I reckon I could literally drink myself into a coma in a night of it. 

But next time I go out I'm actually not going to get smashed and try and chat some girls up rather than just necking as much booze as humanly possible.

**Some more clarification:**

In the England (and Wales) we refer to the school grades as 'years'. Year 1-6 is primary school, Year 7-11 is secondary school, Year 12-13 is sixth-form/college. Primary schools are sometimes split into 'infants' and 'junior' school.  In addition, there are 4 'Key Stages' (and one 'unofficial one), which correspond to groupings of years.

In practice the SATs at Key Stage 1 are unimportant as there's no selection done on them. Key Stage 2 SATs are used for selection for secondary schools. GCSEs/BTECs etc are used for sixth-form entry and as qualifications for employers.

Sixth-form is the term used for courses which are taught by a school which is also a secondary school. Not all secondary schools have sixth-forms. Colleges are seperate and often offer a wider-range of courses and more flexible environments. 

* Year 1-2 (Ages 5-7) - Key Stage 1 - Infants School / Primary School - SATs
* Year 3-6 (Ages 8-11) - Key Stage 2 - Junior School / Primary School - SATs
* Year 7-9 (Ages 12-14) - Key Stage 3 - Secondary School - SATs
* Year 10-11 (Ages 15-16) - Key Stage 4 - Secondary School - GCSEs / BTEC / Applied GCSEs
* Year 12-13 (Ages 17-18) - (Key Stage 5) - Sixth-Form - AS &amp; A-Levels

**University courses:**

In England, a Bachelor's degree at University is typically a 3 year full-time qualification. In Scotland I believe most Bachelors are 4-year courses because Scotland has only 1 year between GCSEs and University. With sufficient grades it's therefore possible for an English student to start in the second year.

**Typical course lengths:**

* BA/BSc/etc - 3 years full time study
* Undegraduate Masters (MSc) - 4 years full time study
* PhD - 7 years?

Many universities offer students the ability to take an industrial placement as 'gap year' during their degree. So a BSc with an Industrial Placement would then take 4 years.

Cambridge (and Oxford I think) grant students an additional MA shortly after they graduate.

**Degree classifications:**

In the UK we don't use the Latin classifications (cum laude, summa cum laude, etc):

Instead we use: 1st (First), 2:1 (Upper Second), 2:2 (Lower Second), 3rd (Third), Pass (Ordinary/without Honours), Fail.

The requirement to achieve the various grades varies on the University and so ""proportion of student's achieving a first"" is not a useful measure.",0,1364783464,null,0,1364784838,0,c962o91,t3_19an55,t1_c962o91,t1_c8mjbes,null,1431715317,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,strolls,null,null,"I don't know why I'm indulging you, but in your previous comment, you said:

&gt; a prosecutor refusing opportunity of questioning unless it is on Swedish soil for no good reason, and so on and so on.

By this alone you're showing your lack of judgement in this matter. 

No police force anywhere in the world, nor any state department of prosecutions, allows you to dictate to them where and when you'll give an interview. Not one. You come in to the station and give a statement, you don't tell the cops ""oh, I'll talk to you over Skype"".

Yes, I know he already offered to give a statement before he left Sweden, but that's tough luck because the charges have been revived.

So another prosecutor within the government is more aggressive about pursuing sex crimes or suspects who are famous - that's tough luck, too, because the statute of limitations allows that. Double-jeopardy has not been breached. 

Yes, the charges were previously dropped - I'm glad we agree on that, because it means you accept that two female complainants went to the police station and asked for advice regarding Assange's sexual conduct.

As a consequence of that, a valid European arrest warrant has been issued, it's been reviewed by the highest courts in the land - Assange has to face the music, and it's nonsense to try and pretend he shouldn't.

From what I've heard and read of this case, from what information is in the public domain, I don't think Assange should be found guilty of any crime. Personally, I don't think that anyone should ever be convicted in any *he said, she said* case, because I don't think that such witness statements can ever be considered true *beyond reasonable doubt*. The women have, IMO, spoiled the case by colluding together. 

However, there is not the least doubt that Sweden and its citizens have the right to justice, and that requires them to investigate this case and to interview him. And, as I said before: you don't get to tell the cops how to interview you; you don't get to dictate Skype videoconferencing. 

It is as a consequence of his refusal to return to Sweden, to face the music which was wrought by his own ungentlemanly behaviour, that Assange has made a mockery of himself. It is for these reasons that he deserves to be the butt of our jokes.

In a decade or two he'll still be stuck in that bloody flat, off Kensington High Street, becoming old and irrelevant. People will ask ""who's Julian Assange, then, what did he do?"". He has derailed his own career not so much by waggling his willy - god knows, enough of us are careless there - but by cooking up and claiming a ""conspiracy"" over perfectly ordinary and petty charges. He could have flown into Sweden, kept his gob shut, secured a not-guilty verdict and claimed success. It is Assange's own refusal to face the music which convicts him in the public eye - he won't return because he knows he knows he was a bit of a naughty boy. I'm not saying he's a rapist, but he has clearly been betrayed by his own knob.

By replying to every single comment in this thread, you make yourself look like a nutter. You have me wondering if you might even be Assange himself, because who else would feel the need to defend him so vigorously, even against charges that he's an smelly unwashed bastard? I can't see why you should have such investment in him - Assange is now a joke, and it's his own fault. 

Please don't reply to me again, I don't want to hear you debating this matter (although if you want to say ""fair enough, Strolls, you know what, I think you're right, you've convinced me"", then I'll be glad to accept that). I think I've been more than fair to you in giving you my 650 final words on this subject, I don't want to hear any more of your bullshit.

true,LeTouche,num30-away,,"Agreed. But it's similar, kinda, to Michu on the weekend. Like any player, he was hyper competitive and would do anything for his team, whether it's putting all that pressure on Dawson, getting his body in the way of SuperJan, all of that. It's not a nice thing to see, but it's hypocritical to say Michu was dickish when, to a lesser extent albeit, Brad was too.

I don't want to condone Michu's bravado, or even liken Brad's supposed 'timewasting' to Michu's rashness, but it's a similar thing. It would be like calling someone an ass for diving, when we have Gareth, the almighty, Bale on our team! He is picked on, there are circumstances, but he has dived before, and has a reputation for it.

I get that there's a lot of animosity at the moment towards Michu, but he was doing all he could for his team. Nobody got hurt, and he was punished for what he did, although he did really deserve the 2nd yellow in the 90th minute.

Then, in present time, The Great Intelligence is searching for Clara (notice how they say that certain people are ""chosen"") because she bested him, finds her and attempts to corrupt her, failing only because of the Doctor. Fast forward to the Asylum timeline, the same thing happens. The Great Intelligence (in this case, via the Daleks of the asylum) finds Clara again and succeeds in corrupting her, only she is smarter now and manages to delete the Doctor from the Dalek database before dying. 

The point being, The Great Intelligence is not traveling through time. The Doctor is. The Great Intelligence is also at the whims of whatever force is placing Clara in multiple points in time. It is not in control of the situation any more than the Doctor is.

The teachers told students off if they heard English on the corridors, but students still did it.

The attitude towards us who did speak Welsh was also awful. In a Welsh school, there shouldn't be a 'welshies' group. In a year of around 120, I was one of about 20 who actually spoke Welsh with my friends.

If they really wanted to free up houses, they would set up a scheme to move people into more appropriate housing, instead of taking money from them.

Plenty of couples are in two bedroom houses, not because they thought ""Hell yeah, lets have two spares rooms to fuck around in"" but because they needed somewhere to live, and the NIHE contacted them and said ""Here is a house we deem fit for you to live in."" Now, after being placed in that house, by the government, they are being told ""Sorry, but that house we said was fine for you is now too big for you, it's our fault you were placed in it, so to make up for it we're going to cut your money.""

It's the same old shit from the Conservatives, they are taxing the poor to help the rich, and dressing it up in bullshit to pull it off.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"I don't know. I think the idea, the principle, behind what they're attempting here is sound. If you are going to live in a property owed by the commons for free, then it should be no bigger than what you need. Especially when there is a waiting list of people needing the residence more.

The problem is the implementation and lack of aforethought. It is no good moving people into smaller housing where that smaller housing doesn't exist. Or when the exemptions list doesn't accurately include all legitimate reasons. And that is the beauty of ianvisits suggestion. You are only taxed when refusing being moved into such a property that does exist, and not before! It ensures a saving (possibly) and is fairer. Perfect.

It is treating a symptom to a different problem. And that problem is a lack of correctly sized council houses. And a related problem, that existing houses rents are tied to 80% of the LHA with no good reason so other than to make it 'commercially acceptable' - unnecessarily inflating the HB bill.

Of course, building more council houses is incompatible with the ideology of this administration. A better solution (for them) would be to sell off all council homes and reform the HB system to work only with private renting. In one swoop you have commercial compatibility and a huge stock of homes to put HB people in (provided you make 'No DSS' illegal also). Is of course, complete short termism as in the long run, it will make HB costs more since the rent demanded will be that of the commercial sector rather than the heavily discounted social sector, which worries less about things such as LL insurance and mortgage interest payments.

Second, the episode you're referring to (Night Terrors) wasn't even written by Steven Moffat.

And third, are you seriously trying to say that the idea that an alien child who uses powerful psychic powers to create a pocket dimension where his fears are manifested is the most outlandish thing you've seen in the show? Just in RTD's time we've had things like:

*A fat green alien that absorbs people and turns them into talking faces on his body, which the Doctor explodes with his sonic screwdriver, and then proceeds to reanimate a face out of a cement block.

*alien microbes that infected a girl's brain, giving her the power to turn people into crayon drawings, all because she was abused by her father.

*Alien witches who hypnotize William Shakespere to write a play that will open a space-time portal to unleash more witches unto earth.

and even in the classic series there were stories like:

*A tentacle beast that drops glowing brain-meteors on Earth that it uses to manipulate and control plastic shop dummies.

*The doctor going to the old west to see Doc Holiday for a toothache and getting caught up in the shootout at the OK Corral, while his companions are held at gunpoint in a bar, being forced to sing showtunes for cowboys.",0,1364794335,null,0,false,0,c966a3l,t3_1bd4fh,t1_c966a3l,t1_c965b7m,null,1431713618,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

1. Emergency temporal shift lands Dalek Clara in Victorian times.

2. Dalek Clara fillets, pulps and sifts humans to transform herself into a Dalek-Human hybrid using a transformation machine she built, but because she's a genius (unlike Dalek Sec), she succeeds in restoring herself to mostly human form.

3. After Clara falls off the cloud and is buried, Clara's pig slaves exhume her body and return her to The Machine to produce a new Clara, complete with her memories as they existed just before she entered The Machine the first time. 

4. Realizing that she has, in a manner, developed a way to be immortal, she decides to at all times keep a healthy contingent of pig slaves in her underground bunker. Whenever she fails to check in after a certain period of time, the pig slaves create a new Clara clone using DNA from the original Dalek-Human Victorian Hybrid Clone Clara Corpse. Because she is so ashamed of her Dalek past, or perhaps because she has buried those memories in her subconscious, Clara retains no memory of the Doctor from her time in The Asylum. And because each new cloned copy of Clara comes from before the Doctor's Victorian visit, she honestly doesn't recognize him each time she meets him.

It's partly down to the way you presented it. Like if you had gone way OTT like ""The charges for first-class are utterly ghastly"" or what have you then it'd be seen as more comical but it wasn't so that didn't do you any favours. Nor did explaining you only bought a first-class ticket to get away from the usual ""scummy dickheads"" on coaches because you're much better than just about everyone else who uses public transport, which did a good job of offending just about everybody and making you look like a ponce. Everybody agress public transport costs are high, but they're talking about regular costs, everybody can agree with that. If someone comes along and says ""Cor! Ain't train fares expensive eh? Fucking paid an arm and a leg for a first-class return!"" that ""Heheh, yeah that's true"" reaction becomes a ""Well of course, what did you expect? It's first class! Nobody made you pay for it so quit whining about a choice you made."" in addition; you're eighteen, which means complaining about things to people older than you just makes you seem obnoxious and entitled, and will never be taken seriously. I'm a little older than you, if people our age complain about what's perceived as the good shit it gets the heckles up of older people who think we haven't seen enough good or bad shit to have earned the right to complain about shit at all.

 You may well have been joking but it didn't come across that way very much, and I see in a comment here you've questioned their behaviour because they're acting like you're a stuck-up twat when generalscruff knows you're not. The people in the linked thread aren't generalscruff, and you presented yourself as a stuck-up twat for reasons outlined above. In the right situation anybody can look like a twat.

 What I find to be a particularly amusing quirk is that /r/britishproblems is serious about it's problems even though it's roots are in a light-hearted sub. From what they had to go on and the way you presented yourself I'd say they're being a little petty, and perhaps a tad harsh but that you're not casting yourself in a good light either, and that all parties involved acted like a bit of a tit, but I'd also say it's not important.

immigration... tricky point to address, as an economic theory, the left wing typically champions protectionism, so you could say that the bbc is holding a traditional left wing attitude, thats just picking at bones though.

Under Labour, **it is estimated**, that some 3m immigrants entered the country. That represents 5% of the population roughly.

I look at my friends who were able to live at home in to their mid 20s. They're buying houses now where my SO and I can't forsee ever doing so because of the cost of rent; they have travelled abroad, take frequent weekend breaks and generally have the disposal income to enjoy their 20s. 

I would experiment before moving out. Work out all the outgoings you would pay living alone and try to live on what's left of your wage each month. If you can do it comfortably then go for it. I would recommend not struggling though  if you don't need to. 

Of course this depends on how your parents treat you, if you need to leave, you would survive, OP, you just need to be sensible.

true,TheMania,null,null,"You're perfectly entitled to desire a small government, but you ought not desire one with minimal debt - at least not without completely redesigning our monetary system.

Government debt = non-government savings. In a debt-based monetary system, that is an accounting identity. We could, if we wanted to, have all our savings confiscated Cyprus style and that would extinguish all government debt - but when the government is the issuer of the currency this is completely unnecessary. We ought simply allow ourselves those savings, but to do so we must allow the government to have outstanding debt - and importantly, desire for it to continue to have outstanding debt.

The only way to have a minimal debt government whilst also having consumption and investment high enough for full employment with today's monetary systems is to architect the system such that we desire no savings, ie Australia - taxation policies there encourage all householders to be leveraged up to their eyeballs. Everyone borrows to buy houses, and as soon as they're eligible they do it again - all fostered by taxation policies which heavily incentivise this process. This allows the government to get by with minimal debt, as the people are not sitting on savings - but I fear it may long-term prove not the most stable of systems. Far better to simply allow the government to accrue debt, and provide us savings in the forms of cash and bonds backed by the currency-issuer such that we are content to spend suitable for high employment.

The existence of government debt does not preclude a small government though, a small government is just a low taxing, low spending one - but it ought, under today's monetary systems, still spend more than it takes in, for deficits add to our savings, surpluses destroy, and balanced budgets leave our savings stagnant which may not allow our savings desires to be met leaving consumption/investment too low for high employment.",1,1364808524,null,0,false,0,c9686f0,t3_1bdpg9,t1_c9686f0,t1_c9683e8,null,1431712723,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,GrayCious,null,null,"The Virgin books were a long running series of books in the 1990s. They were mostly very much of their time and although featuring excellent work by Russell T Davis and Mark Gatiss they're largely overlong fan-fic and an overreliance on cyberpunk and living internets have caused many of them to date badly (although there are still some gems). They made several massive missteps by tying advanced races / technologies to 20th century ideas. One of them was tying all the superbad villains like the GE, Toymaker, Nestine Conciousness to the Lovecraft mythos, essentially reducing both the villains themselves to something 'explainable' and also the originality of the writing itself.

I was wrong yesterday with regards to the Satin Pit... It actually refutes the Virgin tie-in. In Virgin the Great Old ones come from before time (survivors from a previous universe). But The Satin Pit, the Doctor has never heard of creatures from before time... Seems that this Doctor is not the same Doctor from the Virgin adventures.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Depends on what your priorities are. Academically, Imperial is much better regarded than Southampton. Not to say the Southampton is bad, because it isn't; but for the sciences Imperial is a world leader (consistently among the top 10 worldwide and top 5 in the UK). Professionally, it is also extremely well regarded, with the highest average graduate starting salary and almost always in the top 2 with LSE in employer reputation. But then again, Southampton is in the Russell Group so it's not like you're taking a massive step down.

With that having been said, Imperial has huge shortcomings. It has a 34:66 female to male ratio and it's probably closer to 20:80 in Mech Eng, which makes the university atmosphere feel homogeneous and slightly sexist (although the abundance of males might not be a huge disadvantage from your perspective). It also has a huge Asian population -mainly Chinese, 31% of the student body-, so it has an interesting cultural atmosphere (which, once again, you might enjoy having lived Asia). It's a bit of a stereotype, but it's somewhat true that Imperial is full of nerds who'd rather study than go out. People do rarely go out and most nights people will be dicking around on their computer (Reddit, gaming...) or studying.

The financial difference isn't so big for us ""locals"" since tuition fees are the same in both, but I've just checked and just tuition fees are almost twice as expensive at Imperial for international students. Add in the extra cost of living in London and you're paying a hefty premium for the ""benefits"" of Imperial.

It all depends on what you think you'd prefer. Personally, despite its disadvantages, after visiting friends at other universities I prefer the atmosphere at Imperial. But if I was your place, the price tag would've made me think about it.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"At the risk of downvotes and a serious response:

UKIP started as a single issue party, based on leaving the EU. Over time they've realised that single issue parties don't win elections and have tried to fill out their manifesto. The problem is that while it's easy for people to rally around one idea, it's harder to get them to rally around many. When you ask a UKIP member what UKIP stands for beyond the EU, you'll get different responses from different members. This is simply due to the fact that the party's fairly young and still findings it's feet.

Secondly, UKIP have traditionally cut into the hardline tory vote as tories start to become more centrist in order to win elections (As Labour did when they became New Labour). This marginalised other left and right wing parties, pushing them further in order to capture voters. Again, a combination of UKIPs youth and inexperience and the fact that they needed support meant that they've inherited an awful lot of tories that may have particularly abhorrent views, and in the process made themselves a target for the left who feel they can bash them with the durr hurr racist tag, as opposed to the more nuanced durr hurr you have a bunch of people who are living in the 80s with outdated views tag which would also probably be more accurate.

What's started happening recently is that UKIP are now picking up disenfranchised Labour voters, and they're having to come a bit more to the left. It is happening - as the more left wing voters start to come in they'll have to pay more lip service while risking alienating those more to the right - incidentally something very similar happened when the Lib Dem party formed from the SDP and Liberals, there's actually a schism to this day in the Lib Dems from this.

The final bit is that currently UKIP *is* Nigel Farage. The minute he goes, the party's over.

As an aside, having UKIP (and the smaller parties) gain a few seats in parliament would probably be a good thing. Currently the diversity in parliament is terrible and is what's adding to the sleaze and general ill faith in parliament. Having a Green seat is great - having a Green majority probably less so for everyone concerned. Having two or three UKIP seats in parliament could make for some interesting debates (if you've ever seen UKIP in the EU Parliament you'll know what I mean) while not giving them an awful lot of influence.",0,1364810702,null,0,false,0,c968dl0,t3_1bdvjg,t1_c968dl0,t1_c962mhl,null,1431712629,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

There's not one single historical example of bond markets moving unfavourably against a nation that has all debt denominated in the free-floating currency it issues - yet that's what all austerity in the UK is based around. That the UK might be the first to experience this, and so despite that it currently has available to it real negative interest lending, it's choosing not to take these negative interest loans, choosing not to willingly create more bonds, cutting spending and leaving millions unemployed.

The thing is - as long as it's assumed that the UK government would sooner print than default, it will *always* get the lowest interest lending attainable in GBP over the term of the loan - irrespective of its debt. It just can't be any other way, for bonds - as a promise from the currency issuer - are as safe as the currency they are denominated in.

That's why Japan gets zero interest lending despite its books making not a lick of sense from a business perspective - because the market believes that the Bank of Japan will have banks lending to one another at 0% interest for the forseeable future. Why would banks loan to one another for 0% interest if they could buy bonds, as safe as yen itself, returning &gt;0% interest? They wouldn't, obviously. Hence Japanese bonds, like UK bonds, return zero interest - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, despite the massive differences in debt.

Yet Cameron and co ignore all this, they continue to think of the government like a currency-user - that one day the markets will reason that the UK has run out of British pounds and hike up rates.

&gt; Assange has to face the music, and it's nonsense to try and pretend he shouldn't.

I never claimed he shouldn't, my claim is that the US pose up to a lethal threat that makes him a just political asylum seeker.

Well, you do. Various Swedish investigations have been furthered by internet video link and remote interviews. If Sweden truly wanted the case to proceed they would swallow their pride, interview him in London, and then formally charge him if indeed that is what they want to do as David Allen Green claims.

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"Just been doing some calculations based on my own lifestyle. I think to **just** accomodate water, heating and cooking you could get by on £53 a week. Assuming you're a single person living in a one bedroom flat

* £53 * 52 = £2756p/year
* Electricity and heating: £35 a month, £420p/year (assuming you have an efficient boiler and have the heating on a reasonable temp that only comes on/off at set times)
* Water: £100 every 6 months, £200p/year (assuming you're on a water meter and use water responsibly)

This gives you £2136 left over for cooking/food provision or around £41 a week, which is a lot of money to play with if you purchase appropriately and don't spend too much on luxuries.

Obviously I'm guessing the ""water, heating and cooking"" stipulation in your post was an over simplification of what peoples real world expenses are actually like, and most people at the bottom of the ladder don't have efficient boilers or water meters and are forced to have pre-pay electricity meters which is more expensive.

I don't see why its unfair either. After all, the rest of us mere mortals will have to work to 68+. Many of the current pensiors (especially the women) retired as young as 60. In fairness, they would never have expected to live past 75 but many now live over 90. So their NI and pension contributions were never large enough to cover what is now being paid out... so they ought to contribute more. 

We need to move away from this idea that the state pension is like a reward, so you can live out your last years in luxury. The state pension is a recognition of the fact you can no longer work. It should be enough to survive off - if you want anything else take it from your own savings or downsize.

Pensiors also have other associated costs like their disproportionate use of the NHS. Not many people realise but its actually difficult to find someone under 65 in a hospital. They also make up the majority of GP appointments and the majority of the prescription budget - and they don't even pay for their prescriptions.

If you look at where our tax money goes, pensions take up about the same amount as the rest of the welfare state combined. Its amazing, and of course will get far worse in the next few decades as the baby boomers start to retire en masse.

Maybe the had a kid that grew up or dies. Maybe the room was there and the council just gave them a house because it was the only house without damp. There are a million reasons why you would have a spare room that are out of your control.

And why should we move? Where should we move? Anyone who has a home in London is lucky and having to move out is the most stressful expensive thing to do. Does the government actually expect poor people to ""just move""? and leave everything they know?

This government is full of cunts who couldn't give a fuck about the people.

That deficit chart an OP Dad made really but it into perspective, the debt only ballooned after the banks got bailed out and the welfare bill only went up because people  were being made redundant.

People need to wake up and realise this Government is treating the whole country like Eton and we are all their fags.

well fuck you 

Fuck this government. These are three changes to make things better for young people

1. Make unpaid internships illegal as a job description, make them paid. 
2. Build more houses
3. Borrow more money and rebulid roads, schools, hospitals and update all public services.

I look to the future and i worry about job prospects in the future and about the quality of life in general. I used to love London but its quickly turning in a shit hole full of international rich cunts gallavanting around pushing up house prices and rents for us normals.

true,BelovedApple,null,null,"&gt;Electricity and heating: £35 a month

if only it was that cheap, I have the heating on for 2 hours a day atm and it still costs me £10 a week. Then on top of that the electric is £10 a week too, and this comes from some one who is out of the house for upto 11 hours a day weekdays, and the only thing that required power that is left on constantly is the fridge and boiler. everything else is turned off from the switch in the wall when I go to bed. I should note that the gas would usually be gone by the end of the week too. Unfortunately I did not have a shower, so a bath would take more gas, but I had one bath every two days and wash every morning.

I usually go to bed any where from 11pm to 1am, that gives me approx 5-7 hours a day at home + weekends, (not counting when I would go to my brothers and watch a film) and that comes to £10+. How the hell would someone who spends 24/7 at home be cheaper than that.

Water is £33 per month. I currently do not have a TV licence as I do not watch it but most people would, that's another +£128 a year. 

by myself I can get by by spending say £15 a week a food minimum.

that comes to £2344 for me, I should note I would rarely buy cereal or anything of the sort.

eventually a person would need to buy some new clothes.

Phone credit and internet are a luxury but would be needed to have any real chance of finding work.

Whilst £53 a week may be enough to survive on, it is not enough to live on; and there are some things that I would argue are a need and not a luxury. 

My main complaint, however, is that the food one is required to eat in order to live upon £53 causes more of a drain on the national coffers than cuts in benefits and curbed spending increases.

Speaking as someone who lived on less than £53 a week, at the time my benefits were £42 a week, I ate a diet so deficient in nutrients (and no, not microwaveable burgers), that I ended up with several medical conditions. Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies and infections a healthy person would have been able to fend off.

That figure was just based on my experience, but I understand that not everyone has the luxury of an efficient modern boiler.

No, my idea of need is based on what keeps a person alive. That's need to me. As in, basic human need, food, water, shelter, clothing.

&gt;There are hardly any public phones around these days, so how would you let your employer know when you are ill?

£10 mobile phone, pay as you go £10 into it, don't use it except for emergencies. Or go to a payphone, there's still a fair few in most cities I've been to.

&gt;The people who calculate minimum income requirements have no axe to grind, have another, more realistic look at how they have calculated it.

I'm not saying they necessarily do, I'm just saying that to describe £27.50 as the minimum necessary amount of money to live on is farcical. I mean, answer me this (really, I'm curious) - do you *really* think that that could be described as the minimum necessary amount to live on?

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It does cover water, heating, cooking and food. Source: I lived on JSA for about nine months. 

The real problem is buying what you might call 'assets'. For instance, a new frying pan, or a new pair of shoes, or (heaven forbid) a new fridge. If you had a well stocked kitchen and wardrobe before you start, then you can live quite comfortably on JSA, and you can more or less replace things as you go. I actually ate very well during that period. But if you start from scratch (say, a single suitcase, and then an unfurnished flat), it would take you years to get up to a basic standard of living.

Edit: FWIW, I should say it is depressing living like that. But most of that arises from the fundamental lack of direction which you feel from not having anything to do, and from the basic fact of being unemployed. I think it's fine to live in that way (even somewhat pleasant, if you have monkish tendencies) as long as you feel like you're going through a short spartan period towards some ultimate goal. But many people do not have the resources to drive themselves through such a period, and they end up feeling that they're gradually going under. It is cruel to put people who are vulnerable in that situation without real help from outside. 

That's why I'm okay with benefits being spartan, but only on the basis that the funding is there for the employment service to be a real employment service. People need to be actively engaged and helped by the Job Centre, not just put through an intentionally humilitating box-ticking ritual, and there need to be serious, well-funded training pathways set up towards employment. The major cost of unemployment is food, accommodation, and so on, you could just as well have people living at permanent residential training colleges, where they could take classes, and be constantly building their skills towards employment. Or, if (on second thought), that sounds a bit like a workhouse, you could just fund people to go through local colleges and training schemes. Apart from the moral question, education and training is a matter of straightforward investment, to reduce future expenses, and increase future tax revenues.

* That means that claimants don't have to spend a huge amount of time jumping through hoops, welfare can be handled in one organization, rather than spread between national and local government, and administration costs are reduced.

I don't think I put it across too well (or at all) in my previous post but I do agree with you on this. But as you say;

&gt;The problem is the implementation and lack of aforethought. It is no good moving people into smaller housing where that smaller housing doesn't exist. Or when the exemptions list doesn't accurately include all legitimate reasons. 

That there is the part I find so awful. Plus, the problem of social housing in the rural areas is a problem - if one child moves to university and the nearest other social housing is 20 miles away (and in some cases, being rural myself, I know that this could be far from worst-case) means uprooting a family, possibly sending children to new schools and destroying current friendship groups. Rural transport is another issue altogether but nevertheless ties in.

We can always come back to the argument that they should just be happy to have a roof over their head, but I don't feel this respects the fact that wellbeing is mental as well as physical.

I think your solution is among the better ones I've heard - solving the problem of lack of smaller houses and issues in moving people around rural areas.

true,MooMorris,null,null,"It's one of those policies where it's good in principle but the reality and application is flawed.

I completely agree with you- there's a housing shortage and an empty bedroom is a waste, but there's several key problems.

The amount of suitably sized accommodation in an area is unlikely to be a perfect match of the amount of people and their needs who require social housing. Inevitably this is going to mean that some people will be punished when they have no option to move. Moving them to another area (as Hammersmith is planning to do via a link up with Peterborough) is a desperate and immensely harsh option. It also would disadvantage people in the 'substitute' area and violates most local authorities rules on requiring a link to the area to qualify for housing.

The benefits cap is also huge, especially in London. London rent is insanely high and will take up a huge amount of their allowance. If someone can't move, their rent won't go down, just their income, so they are being punished twice.

There are some people that will regularly require an additional room, but that is not always utilised. Right now, many boroughs state that if a resident has not occupied a social housing unit for 3 months, they no longer have residency of it. Unless specifically stated in the tenancy agreement (as most in care and support have), this rule will not be waived for being in hospital or prison. You are therefore punishing people for something that is out of the control of all the residents in a tenancy. 

To the Governments credit, they have now exempted registered carers and those with family in the armed forces, however there is still a lot of room for problems.  ",0,1364820520,null,0,false,0,c969j3e,t3_1bdd42,t1_c969j3e,t3_1bdd42,null,1431712015,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The current UK government has an election pledge to drastically reduce the number of immigrants coming into the country -- this pledge is still unmet and, crucially, the government is currently being challenged electorally by a strongly anti-immigration party (UKIP) which means that if anything the entry requirements are only going to get tougher over the next couple of years.

There are basically three categories of visa still available if you don't have an EEA country's citizenship:

* Get offered a job in the UK paying over £150,000 -- there are no visa restrictions for the super-rich.
* Get a job with a company in the USA that also has UK offices and get an intra-company transfer -- these sort of visas are relatively straightforward for the employer to obtain
* Try to find a job yourself. Note that this is not easy: even if you're offered a job, unless it's on the [Shortage Occupation List (PDF link)](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf) then you won't be offered a visa.

The problem is that this comes after months and months of government anti-welfare 'propaganda' (for want of a better term) that has consisted of freezes on welfare payments against inflation and the attacks on the disabled and the whole 'strivers and shirkers' crap too.

We have someone who has no problems with money telling people who have been putting up with all this hate and labelling that ""He could do it if he had to"". This isn't a contest, nobody is trying to out-benefit each other. The majority of claimants don't want to be on benefits and it doesn't help that there is a minister in charge of welfare who takes this sort of attitude.

I've never really been a fan of what amounts to utilitarianism. The language of 'fairness' in the welfare state only exists to try balance the welfare state with a working population, leaning towards making those in work happy with the provision for those not in work.

As for the whole 'returning to the original values of the welfare state', the Conservative Party has no license to claim any form of history with relation to its founding and existence. The Liberals and the Labour Party through reform over the last 100 years created the whole thing with regular opposition from the Conservatives on the various legislation.

true,scoutisimba,cnty-uk,Cambridge,"&gt;I think whether it is ""working"" or not depends on what figures you look at. We missed our growth target, but unemployment is looking better recently. Also, Osbourne said we were recovering faster than France or Germany - I haven't checked that myself.

Sorry got to disagree with this. There's a lot of spin on the employment figures in my view. The Coalition are making a big deal that employment is up, however given that GDP is stagnating it's evident without even looking at the employment breakdown that much of this work will be part time or low productivity. There's also a lot of funny business going on in regards to counting those pushed off welfare or onto work schemes. In fact, even the conservative back benches don't follow the party line, citing poor employment figures to support a tougher stance on immigration. 

Also, there's no way we're recovering better than Germany. I don't mean to paint Germany as a country without troubles or the UK as a horrid wasteland, as that's simply not true, but by most metrics Germany is ahead. For example Germany has a GDP above it's pre-crisis peak whereas we're not looking to be there until at least 2015. 

&gt;The REAL problem imo is that we weren't prepared for this going in. Lots of countries used the boom time to amass tons of money, and now that we are in recession, they have increased government spending to compensate. 

Well, I agree that Labour spent more than they should, leaving us in an unnecessarily tough spot. That said, regardless of how much we blame the previous government the main concern should always be for the present and the future. So I consider the real problem to be that it's three years later and the situation is still pretty grim. 

&gt;Our problem is that we spent like crazy during the boom and now we HAVE to cut during the recession. We can't spend our way out without taking on even more debt.

Well, not necessarily. A country can take on more debt and yet still have a smaller deficit (or a larger surplus). Some economists think that given our sustained period of stagnation we might actually do better not to cut so quickly. This is because fiscal consolidation measures will reduce economic growth, which evidently in the case of the UK has cancelled out a lot of the savings we've made from spending cuts. 

Whether or not that will work is a matter of debate, however we'd both agree that austerity hasn't work as well as we  all hoped it would. ",0,1364821712,null,0,1364939633,0,c969qhy,t3_1bdpg9,t1_c969qhy,t1_c968f9g,null,1431711918,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This isn't counting the vast amount of graduates that are working in unskilled jobs that don't need degrees.

Overall, like I said, you should really consider why you want to do this. A change of scenery really isn't a good enough reason in the current economic climate.

Iain Duncan Smith would be called upon to live on this budget for at least one year. This would help realise the conservative party`s current mantra that ""We are all in this together"".

This would mean a 97% reduction in his current income, which is £1,581.02 a week or £225 a day after tax.

(Sarcasm aside, your definition of the word 'survival' is very loose indeed. This isn't about anyone have a free ride - it's about how genuinely possible it is to live on £55 a week for any amount of time. I know first, second (through friends) and third (through strangers) hand how hard it can be to find employment and so you could realistically be looking at spending a lot longer than a week on JSA whilst trying to find any work. 

...and that's assuming we're looking for *any* work here, rather than something that is actually relevant to a persons interests, abilities, skills etc. - I knew one girl who spend over 6 months trying to get into teaching and who wouldn't accept work in other areas because she didn't want to get locked down into something irrelevant after she spent so much time and effort training for a real profession. Whether she was right to do so or not - it illustrates how long it could take to find employment in your chosen profession, rather than just 'a job' (which is all the folks at the job center care about).

Getting back to IDS... do you *really* think he has the first clue about the plights of 'the people'? This man claims he could spend a mere 7 days on £55 a week when some who are desperate (but unsuccessful) in finding work might have to spend months on it. Does that take into account... rent? Fixing that broken washing machine? Replacement light bulbs or other household essentials?

I don't think IDS has the first clue how to really spend £55 a week on basic survival and from the way you write - I don't think you do either.)

The joint probability distributions involved should scare the shit out of most researchers; its perhaps a reasonable hypothesis given empirical observation but not an easily testable one.

There are statistics to show that helmets won't help you in high speed crashes (which makes sense, they aren't that durable), but there are no statistics to suggest that helmets make you worse at cycling on busy roads.

Its a simplistic argument to say ""Oh, I'm a builder and my salary has been cut by 10%... so 10% public sector cuts are fair"".

There are several issues with that;

* People like nurses, firemen, doctors, paramedics, police etc. don't really work in the private sector in significant numbers, so it's very hard to draw a comparison to what they would/should/could be earning.

* In industries where they do... i.e. teaching, public sector pay actually lags behind the private sector.

* People in industries like manufacturing and construction have seen pay cuts due to supply/demand re-balancing in those industries, as a result of recession - and so one would expect workers to be hit by the cost of restructuring.

* Many of the public sector jobs (like those above) aren't subject to commercial supply/demand. So when nurses take a 10% pay cut, it's not because their hours are going down or they are doing less work... if anything demand for services has risen and more is expected of fewer staff for less pay. I do appreciate this is also the case in the private sector to some extent, but given that government have a monopoly over pay for these jobs there is very little to protect those public sector workers.

I realise many view public sector workers as hopelessly overpaid local council mandarins, but in reality the vast majority (like the 1.4 million NHS staff) are actually doing fairly low&gt;average paid essential jobs, like policing/nursing etc. 

**tl:dr** At any rate, my point was if nurses can take a 10% pay cut - then council tenants can lose £14 a week for having a vacant room. Seems entirely fair to me.",0,1364825356,null,0,1364837907,0,c96ahvw,t3_1bdpg9,t1_c96ahvw,t1_c96a7hs,null,1431711560,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

In comparison, the 50p tax rate was estimated by Labour to bring in [£3bn a year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14810323) (and many say that is has brought in much less). The scales are enormously different, and this analysis ignores the fact that the coalition has increased top-earner capital gains tax (tax for people who make money from investments) from 18% to 28%, and increased the personal allowance for the lowest earners.

You might be talking about the bank bailouts, which are on the right scale. But bear in mind that the last time we had such a serious financial crisis, unemployment spiked hugely, causing enormous hardship. Economists spent 70 years studying what went wrong, and they concluded that the banking system shouldn't be allowed to collapse. Gordon Brown (the man who introduced the 50p tax) agreed, and bailed them out. Also, bear in mind that finance supplied a huge percentage of tax revenue over the previous decade or two, and that most of the bank bailout money was guarantees and shares, which will hopefully be recouped.

The only other policies that I could construe as welfare for business are things like R&amp;D credits, or possibly even infrastructure investment. Dropping those would probably we the most damaging thing we could do, to destroy future growth and employment.

What, specifically, are you talking about?

So for the defense 1 back up keeper and 1 right sided centreback.

In the middle we need a back up for Lucas as we don't have a genuine destructive midfielder. As for the the other 2 midfield positions we are covered. Gerrard, Allen, Henderson, Shelvey and that's before you even start looking at those coming through.

Up front we need back ups as the youngsters we have are still a bit too raw and we need to have a bit more experience to call upon.

As for the squad we need about 4 or 5 players a keeper, a defender, a defensive nidfielder, another striker and possibly a very pacy wideman.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"This is a tough question, I think. A lot of times you simply can't throw together star players, roll the ball out on the pitch and expect brilliant results.

I like what Rodgers and his staff are doing: Creating a *team*, a family, if you will.

In addition, Rodgers is developing young players (and some of those will become stars) and Rodgers is also able to transform some ""mediocre"" players into real solid players.

So... to be title challengers, what do we need? A few more transfer windows, I'm afraid.

In *this* summer's window, I agree with Rodgers. We just need 3-4 more player, ""men"" as he has said. Frankly, our budget (though not as low as some may think, but obviously not unlimited) may only be able to transfer-in a few player or so. But they **must** be top-notch players, experienced, proven talent, men.

As many has been saying below, the priority is shoring up our central defence. Then a strong midfielder or two. Then maybe we can sneak in another talented winger or striker.

Then we try and add 1 or 2 players in the following January window.

And to be title challengers, we need adding quality, keep subtracting the ones that don't cut it, we **must** get Champions League next year and keep raising the bar for players we need to get and the talent that our existing players need to show.

It'll be a long process. But we need to start with some great players this summer and a Champions League spot by the end of next season.",0,1364830693,null,0,false,0,c96by62,t3_1bf5zw,t1_c96by62,t3_1bf5zw,null,1431710876,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I'm a little interested in how you know that I've been a shill for three years though. Your own account is barely two months, and Reddit only lets you search through six months of posts. My account also pre-dates the Assange cricus, so what did I shill about the fist half year?

Anyway I'm willing to learn new things, and it is true that I haven't been keeping up with the evidence for the grand jury since I find it irrelevant (as I'm sure I've told you before), but let's look at your points anyway:

&gt;the stratfor email

That's the one, yes. Unreliable source, but that doesn't mean it's not true.

&gt;Austrialian diplomatic chatter

I haven't been able to find the actual documents, but it seems to come down to the sentence ""the US investigation into possible criminal conduct by Mr Assange has been ongoing for more than a year"". It's inconclusive if this is the grand jury.

&gt;mulitple [1] WikiLeaks Grand Jury Subpoenas

It was my understanding that it was unclear if it was for Assange's grand jury. I might be wrong though. Non of the actual subpoenas seem to mention what it's about.

&gt;Manning trial evidence

I don't know what you're referring to.

&gt;FBI admitting that 7 members of wikileaks being criminally investigated

Why is this a separate point? And how is the link the the grand jury shown?

&gt;FBI carry out interrogation in Iceland

Again, the link? The article itself only mentions Assange in passing and says that it's about Wikileaks.

&gt;That's not a complete list and you are a liar.

Yes, I might have been a bit too quick to claim that there's only one source. There are apparently a few, though non of them is solid as far as I can see. Either way, it's far from ""ample evidence"", and that was the phrasing I disagreed with.

&gt;For some one how is ""hiding"" from the law it strange that no one likes to talk about how he's already talked to the police, in a police station I presume, without the ability to run away. 

Why would they? That was over two years ago, in a early stage of the investigation. As I said, it's only natural in any case to be interviewed many times. You make it seem like the fact that he had an initial interview is somehow being suppressed. It's not. Everyone interested in the case already knows about it.

&gt;You are a dishonest shill who knew full well that there is more evidence beyond Stratfor and you are now backtracking going from ""no evidence"" to ""well I don't believe the evidence is strong enough"".

Do you never get tired of just throwing ad hominems at people? You can't possible think that I'm actually a shill, so why do you keep using such despicable tactics? is it because you know the facts aren't on your side? Yes, there is more ""evidence"" than the stratfor mails, but they don't talk about a prosecution of Assange, but one against Wikileaks, and they're all circumstantial.

After a few months they moves on for unrelated reasons. Yet two weeks later I arrived to work to find numerous furious complaints on the answer phone about the terrible noise keeping him up all night. I had to tell him the property was unoccupied. I assume the noise sounded to him as if it was coming from the flat above, but in fact was from another property entirely.

Noise AFAIK is based on nuisance, so you are unlikely to find there are hard and fast rules about timing and decibels as you might expect. You could speak to your council and find out what they consider reasonable for guidance.

https://www.gov.uk/how-to-resolve-neighbour-disputes/complain-about-noise-to-the-council

What you've been doing is clearly not a statutory nuisance, but you could contact your local council's team to make them aware of the situation, demonstrating you're cooperative. I'd bet they've heard from her a few times and have basically told her to stop calling them. Or if they're taking her seriously, there'll be noise monitors in her flat and they'll find out she's hyperventilating about nothing. 

If that doesn't help, you could write to her, your landlord and the council team explaining that her behaviour (banging, pestering the landlord) constitutes harassment and you have a right to peaceful enjoyment of your flat. She is welcome to contact you if the reasonable volume you listen to music and go about normal activities in your flat is disturbing her but otherwise she should stop harassing you.

I had a similar problem a few years ago with a downstairs neighbour who used to complain daily to my landlord (who I was on good terms with and didn't believe her) about things like ""footsteps"" and ""creaking"" - yet she used to play Earth, Wind and Fire regularly so loudly it would literally move my furniture.",0,1364836876,null,0,1364837205,0,c96d61h,t3_1bfch7,t1_c96d61h,t3_1bfch7,null,1431710301,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I personally think that Holtby was an excellent addition to Spurs. I think that he has shown flashes of what he can do, but for the moment I feel that he is a little off and I think there are several contributing factors.

1) Holtby left a very difficult situation with Schalke. In the lawful to and in the January transfer window, Schalke were struggling mightily for some semblance of form and their league position was showing it. He was one of the few reasons why they were able to hold on and not spiral completely out of control. Things got so bad that Schalke sacked their manager Huub Stevens. To transfer from that negative lockerroom situation to the one at Spurs must have been quite the shift. 

2) Team Play. Holtby is best in a CAM role. At Schalke he had Jermain Jones / Roman Neüstadter and sometimes Marco Höger playing behind him as defensive mids whose roles were to break up attacks and then start a counterattack by feeding Holtby / Farfan / Draxler. Having that backup really freed up Holtby to make plays and create chances. Because he had that safety in behind, he could calculatedly make higher risk passes without a real fear of setting up an opposition counterattack. Spurs play a much more fluid style than Schalke did under Huub Stevens. Stevens very much enjoyed what I call classic German style counterattacking football. Holtby and Farfan/Draxler provided the flair on the backs of the workhorses. To boot, Schalke also have Huntelaar who thrives off of good service. We all are aware that Huntelaar is a fox-in-the-box type center forward. He is quite cunning in his movement and creating space for himself and others. Spurs don't really have that in my opinion in either Adebayor or Defoe. Ade and Defoe have struggled for a large part of this season. Spurs also rely on fluidity and utilize a pivot (Dembele). They don't need two midfield destroyers to create attacks. Thus, Holtby's freedom has to be much more calculated than before.

3) Position. Holtby is a CAM. He can play other positions but his best is as a CAM. He joined Spurs at a time of ascendancy for both club and one Gareth Bale. Bale started taking over matches and showing his true world class abilities. AVB like any sane manager saw that and adapted giving Bale more and more freedom. Suddenly Bale is zooming all over the pitch and is thriving. Holtby enjoyed that type of freedom at Schalke, but there's not really room for 2 CAMs. Suddenly Holtby is on the outside looking in. Additionally Gylfi's performances pick up. It is always going to take a player some time to adapt to a new team, especially in mid season and especially when you come in for a role and then suddenly your role is filled by one of the worlds top talents.

4) Solution. Bale as a false 9, drop the struggling forwards and utilize Holtby as a CAM and give he and Bale both attacking freedom. Parker returns to a midfield disciplined destroyer and Dembele pivots.

true,twogunsalute,eng-lestershire,Lestah,"You should read the whole article - has some very interesting points:

&gt; The global citizen worldview also tends to be suspicious of communities. Or rather the idea of community is praised in the abstract but rejected in the particular in favour of a ""cruise liner"" theory of society in which people come together for a voyage but have no ongoing relationship. This individualistic view of society makes it hard for modern liberals to understand why people object to their communities being changed too rapidly by mass immigration – and what is not understood is easily painted as irrational or racist.

(I wonder if there is a way to separate block texts?)

&gt;But many of the largest groups, such as Somalis, applying to enter Britain and other rich countries as refugees are not facing individual persecution but rather are caught up in regional conflicts or civil wars or even natural disasters. They have usually been granted ""exceptional leave to remain"" or what is now called ""humanitarian protection"". There is no reason why the leave to remain should be permanent. Civil wars and natural disasters come to an end and countries need rebuilding. Rich countries should try to provide shelter from the storm for people badly affected but then ensure they return to help that rebuilding.

And I liked this bit even if it is a bit of a dig:

Definitely talk to her, and if at all possible do everything you can to build a friendly relationship.  Assuming for a moment that she is a reasonable person and is genuinely upset by the noise (why else would she complain?),  try to set a level of sound and at times that you can both agree on.  Indicating that you give a shit will go a long way towards easing her suffering.

So, it boils down to this - is your entertainment more important than someone else's well being?

Well firstly I disagree that they're full of hatred, fear perhaps, but I'm not so sure they're motivated by hatred.

true,a_treacle_fiend,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"&gt;When you don't spend money you are, in fact, saving them. I can't really see why this is a spin. If you can't understand that ""saving £20bn on healthcare"" isn't the same as ""spending £20bn less on healthcare"" you should go back to school.

I think his point is more that the quality of care diminishes. Of course spending less is saving more no matter what way you look at it, but what is given up in terms of service does not warrant the resources you acquire. I tend to agree with him on this actually.

&gt;I HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK AND I'M 28 SO I HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM MUM AND I'M SMARTER THAN EVERYBODY

That's undue criticism, in my opinion. Whilst Owen Jones does tend to have a pompous air to his writing, I'll give you that, this really isn't the point being made. Holding other media outlets accountable for what he deems a lack of coverage is an important issue he raises, not simply gloating.

&gt;This has been the reality in Norway for a long time. Norway, socialist paradise. I lived there for 26 years and I'm still alive, it must be a miracle. My mom even had private surgery twice and is not even disabled!

Fair enough, I agree with you here. I know nothing about Norway but it seems a fair comparison.

&gt;There are plenty of European countries where the health care system is ""privatised"" to a higher degree than in the UK and they manage quite nicely. I can point you towards the Netherlands, for one.

If you take, admittedly what may be considered quite rudimentary, [comparisons across the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems), the only health systems in nations of comparable size that are considered better, namely Spain and France, have even more comprehensive government spending on healthcare.

&gt;No, I have the faith to never read anything you write ever again, and rather stick to people who try to criticise the reforms legitimately with facts'n'shit. Running healthcare is complicated and you're making a tabloid joke of it you condescending fuck.

This is the part I disagree with most, simply because his views contradict yours and you don't like his methods of conveying them, does not make them invalid.

Well that beats Godwin at least.

The concept that everyone's opinion doesn't hold equal worth isn't the same concept that everyone can have an opinion. I believe people are entitled to their opinions and should be free to express them without tyrannical interference from the government of the day. That doesn't mean those opinions are of equal merit to another opinion.

&gt;Well firstly I disagree that they're full of hatred, fear perhaps, but I'm not so sure they're motivated by hatred. 

Without wanting to go all Yoda, you can have one without the other. Are some of them genuinely fearful that immigrants are going to destroy Britain, leading them to hateful policies? Undoubtedly. Are some of them just closet racists? Undoubtedly.

&gt;Secondly, there is a difference between having a discussion with a group and encouraging a group, between listening to what they say and then explaining why you disagree, and patting them on the back. By refusing to even try to bridge the gulf between opposing viewpoints, no progress is made.

Why would I waste my time explaining why I disagree? Other anti-UKIP people have approached them in discussion, the party didn't suddenly implode. So...again...why would I want to do this? There is no gain for myself or them in pointless discussion; when so politically opposite, neither party is suddenly going to change its mind and join the other. There is no common middle-ground for us to reach. You talk of ""progress"", but progress in what?

Really, it comes down to I have no desire to 'bridge the gulf'. Why would I wish to associate with UKIP any more than Golden Dawn or the rest of the anti-immigration parties you can find scattered across the continent? Why would I want to spend time with xenophobes?

&gt;You seem to refuse to recognise that they're human beings, normal people like you or I, who just happen to have different opinions and beliefs than you, but they're not monsters or boogeymen, and pretending they are is not helpful.

A psychopathic rapist (to go all hyperbole) isn't a boogeymen or a gremlin. He's a human being with similar DNA to myself. That doesn't mean I'd wish to spend time with one. You can be someone abhorrent without having to resort to fairytale similes. I don't deny Farrage is human just as I am; but if his opinions are 'normal', then I worry for the rest of us.

&gt;At least they're engaging in the political system, you don't even want to do that, you want to remove any platform of people you don't agree with. That's far worse for democracy and for humans than anything UKIP are trying to do.

true,oxytechx,null,null,"Bradford and Leeds are very close together and commuting between the two shouldn't be too much of a chore.  There are bus and train routes available which may make your commute up to an hour each way (actual train or bus journey is probably 20-35 mins city centre to city centre).

I live in Bradford and here are the things I think you should know.  There will be arguments both ways about Bradford VS Leeds, but I think Bradford comes out on top for me.  Leeds is a bigger city, has a better town centre for shopping and a very diverse demographic.  However, Bradford is like it's cosier little brother - where Leeds feels like a hustling and bustling mini-London metropolis, Bradford feels more calm and community oriented.  There is a great selection of fast-food outlets in Bradford, with actual tasty food and most of it reasonably priced - which brings me to my next point.. I think Bradford is cheaper to live in, especially accommodation.  

Some people might tell you a very negative opinion on Bradford - so you should be aware of a few things.  Bradford is home to a large Pakistani and Muslim population.  However, in my experience, the people who tend to complain about the 'brown muslims' and speak of no-go areas probably have an inherent racism themselves and feel paranoid and threatened, and therefore *project* their own insecurities and fears on to others and see it reflected back as hostility.  You can run into problems in any city, especially with teenage youth groups that get into troubled circles, but generally Bradford is very welcoming and hospitable and a nice place to live (in most areas).  If you are looking for accommodation, I would suggest the following areas as starting points:  Shipley, Saltaire, Nab Wood and Cottingley.  It's probably more expensive than other areas but I think there is a good balance of ethnicity and there is a harmony between them.  For example, people in Saltaire are very friendly and will frequently chat to strangers walking in the streets.  I think that is the selling point of Bradford, it is a nice place to **live**.  However, there may be more opportunities and higher wages in Leeds and a bigger variety of shopping centres, so Leeds is a good place to **work and shop**.  Maybe see if you can get a 'best of both worlds' balance where you live and eat nice and cost effectively but make a small commute to earn and spend more glamorously.

The Laffer curve is obviously a huge simplification - each person will have a different response to the tax, at whatever level. What you might have missed in the IEA/ASI criticism is that it only aims to tell you at what rate the amount of tax taken is maximised - the point at which more taxation is self-defeating even if you only consider the money available to the government. 

If we look a bit wider - and assume (as per [Adam Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour#Adam_Smith) and [David Ricardo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#Comparative_advantage)) that mutual exchange is wealth-creating, then taxing that exchange means that marginally beneficial things aren't done. That is, if I have a job to do that'll cost me $1000 (in cash and annoyance) but a specialist $700, it is beneficial for me to employ him to do it and earn the required money by doing whatever I'm best at. If my paying him $1000 actually (after tax) leaves him with $650 - either the job won't get done (which means $300 of value never gets created) or he'll get paid in used 20s (meaning the taxman gets nothing). 

If employing him costs lots of paperwork, insurance, whatever - that's another strike against employing him. Honestly, I think that's quite as big a problem as the rate of tax in actually allowing economic growth to occur. There are supply-side reformers in government, but they don't seem to be getting much traction.

Shame his ilk aren't banned from the party. 

""Accepting diversity of opinion"" was a fair excuse for that until you booted Neville from Young Independents for being too Libertarian. The party clearly has *some* standards- necrophilia and bestiality being a touch too far, but out-and-out bigotry? Just dandy.

&gt;Take you for example: the way you talk about UKIP and then when pressed acknowledge it's not the party but the supporter, and then when pressed again you admit that it's not even a level of support that's indicative of the whole - yet you continue your UKIP narrative which when pressed you admit to not being in truth.

Wonderfully crafted misrepresentation of my past statements and position there. 

""The way I talk about UKIP"" - this ""UKIP narrative"" I spout, has *always* been ""They have a much higher proportion of racists and bigots in the party than's the norm"". 

That's in no way inconsistent with what I've stated above. Farage et al are, almost certainly, not racists- they're damned unpleasant, slimy, irresponsible, opportunistic, bigoted demagogues, but they've never really indicated that they're racists in any other way.

However, I suspect most western-ish European healthcare systems are quite similar in quality, and – this is from memory – they cost in the region of ~8-10% of GDP for most countries in the continent.

There's a jungle of healthcare models in these countries. They all work quite well – I think you could take most European healthcare systems and implement them in the UK, and people would be quite happy with it, and most importantly, quite healthy. Dutch private insurance, French government run care, or a mix like most other countries – it would *work*.

So, if the Coalition is doing exactly what Jones is saying they're doing and we're taking a super worst-case scenario, I'd say costs could increase slightly and care quality could drop a tiny bit. The NHS would not be *murdered*. It would still be a high-quality European style healthcare system. Nobody would be in danger of losing their lives in an emergency any more than today. And that is what makes the article hyperbolic silliness. 

One argument one could have is this: the fiscal situation being like it is, should we sacrifice a tiny bit of quality to save a lot of money, if that is possible? Is the NHS to be completely isolated from reform or cuts in tight budgets? I don't have the answers, but that would be a valid debate.

I don't invalidate him for his methods or arguments. I'd fire someone from my newspaper if he wrote like Jones, not because I disagree with them, but because it's just irrational flaming rather than constructive debate. Maybe it's easier to see his arguments if one agrees with them in the first place, but I just see a moron without substance.",0,1364851219,null,0,false,0,c96j5uj,t3_1bexug,t1_c96j5uj,t1_c96hc9f,null,1431707406,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

But great, you now admit that their immigration policy has nothing to do with racism.   

Let's move on to the allegation you raise, homophobia.  You know full well that they advocated civil partnerships only to be recognised by government and the judiciary, for all people, irrelevant of the gender.  That they called for equal tax breaks for couples in a civil partnership, irrelevant of gender.  To actually take *government* completely out of the marriage business.    

They said it this way because they knew there was potentially a risk from the ECJ and ECHR which would turn into a freedom of religion argument, and they were also protecting that.  You know all this, because it has been said a thousand times, and yet a thousand times you bring it up.  LibDem MP Sarah Teather certainly isn't a homophobe having campaigned at the front for gay civil partnerships in the first place.  She reluctantly voted against the marriage bill on religious grounds, as did others.  UKIP simply argued a solution to take government out of the marriage issue whilst giving all people same rights under law.  

You're not just a bigot, you're quite content lying and misrepresenting stuff you know not to be true.  More on that in a minute. 

You could actually genuinely address their policies like many others do, and why you think them wrong or misplaced, without staining yourself or needing to lie.   You don't.  You'll say they're racist if you can get away with it, but crumble when pressed.  You'll raise 'Neville' being fired for being too libertarian, and then drop it when somebody points out he was fired for using his position as a youth leader to try and speak for the party direction in the media which wasn't his job.  Will you now do the same when someone points out that it wasn't homophobia, that they wanted to put everybody on the same level as far as the government and law were concerned?  That they were actively trying to protect religions and keep the UK out of European courts at the same time as providing equal rights under law.
 
In arguing that the party are bigots you struggle to identify an indicator but succeed in displaying your own.

--------------

You've just said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1bdvjg/i_for_one_welcome_our_new_ukip_overlords/c96bn73), when pressed, that they're not a racist party,

                 'The party isn't [racist].  The members often are.'  

Pushed some more, [you](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1bdvjg/i_for_one_welcome_our_new_ukip_overlords/c96f0zi) then say this,    

                  'Not all UKIP members are racist - 
                   I'd even hazard that a large majority of them aren't.' 

Here [you](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1a2qql/what_would_a_ukip_britain_look_like/c8tpyxa) are saying, 

         'My skin has a distinctly tanned hue.  
          That, in itself, is reason enough to vote against the bastards.'   

When somebody asks about what *LIES* are being said about UKIP, [you](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1aeqll/why_is_this_place_overwhelmingly_proeu/c8ww98y) reply, 

          '[That] they're a non-racist, libertarian party'  
 
In one breath you'll admit they're not a racist party when pushed on issue, in the next you're saying exactly that  when you think you can get away with it, and that this is how you feel.  It's textbook bigotry, and you've been caught in the lie.  Now, you say you hate UKIP because of their bigotry, and that I'm conflating racism with bigotry,  yet you've still to provide any party policy that stands up to either accusation, but your own particular brand of bigotry is there for all to see.

----------------------

Here's what [you](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1bdvjg/i_for_one_welcome_our_new_ukip_overlords/c96f0zi) said only a few hours ago,

             'It takes genuine effort to acquire a reputation so odious as to necessitate 
              an explicit declaration of ""WE ARE A NON-RACIST PARTY"" on the front page

The Tories are raising taxes elsewhere that will far greatly effect the higher-middle classes and the rich (see the stamp duty raise), and personal allowance which will help those on minimum wages the most. 

To spout a libertarian viewpoint, does any government EVER actively reduce its overall taxation revenue?

true,strolls,null,null,"There are at least a couple of things that need to be stated before I even start a reply to that.

For a start, no-one, outside of Assange and each lady concerned, knows what happened in the privacy of those bedrooms.

Secondly, I have slightly more confidence that he *shouldn't* be convicted, than that he wouldn't (or won't), should he come in front of a Swedish court. 

Although I have a great deal of sympathy for rape justice advocates, survivors and feminists in general, I don't believe the answer to a low conviction rate is *ever* to dismiss the principle that proof of guilt should be required *beyond reasonable doubt*. I actually get the impression this is already violated to a degree with which I'm uncomfortable.

Eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. Many of the black men now being freed in the US, their wrongful imprisonment of decades now recognised through the use of DNA evidence, were originally convicted on the basis of eyewitness testimony. Probably a fair few white men, too.

Studies now show that eyewitnesses can be 80% unreliable within minutes or hours of the incident, and this is supported by the historical evidence of people who were put away for decades, misidentified even though the real perpetrator was less than an arm's length from the victim at the time the crime was committed. 

Obviously no-one doubts that it was Assange who was involved with those women, but certainly details of the events can be forgotten or misremembered, especially if they occurred when the participants were still half asleep.

Finally, the accused victims have queered the pitch by discussing the incidents before reporting them to the police. Yes, I understand that their alarm over the risk of STDs was heightened by the realisation of Julian's promiscuousness, but nevertheless - for all we know (and for all the jury knows) they took the opportunity to conspire and collude. They didn't report the crimes independently - had they each gone to the cops separately, unaware of each other, and the connection was only made by investigating officers, then I'd feel the case much more robust.

In the case of *he said, she said* accusations, I don't really see any way for a court to adjudicate that, not when actually holding to the standard of *beyond reasonable doubt*. An honest witness may be nervous when placed on the stand, especially if they're unjustly accused or victimised by the incident, but also depending on age, infirmity and disposition. It is the duty of the court's barristers to explore fully and throw doubt upon the witness' statements. Many career criminals, on the other hand, know that they must stick to their story, look earnest and shrug off any incongruities - ""I don't know why thought he saw me do that, I didn't"" - then they'll often be found credible.

So, yes, I think a court, or a jury, anyway, has to consider that the allegations may be vindictive, acts of revenge brought by ""women spurned"". If you have two different witnesses saying that the accused has a mole on his inner thigh, or if a distinctive pattern of behaviours is corroborated by independent witnesses, then that might well be enough to convict (multiple witnesses like this, certainly). But these women, unfortunately, put their heads together before going to the police. 

So I hope you can see my reservations - I think that, if this were a UK court, then at least a good barrister should be able to get him off. 

Why is Assange reluctant to return to the scene of the crime? Well, I can understand if he fears extradition to the USA - warranted or paranoid - and it does look suspicious that the case was shelved before being reopened. But generally I suspect he does know he acted like a douchebag in some way. 

I don't believe that the UK appeals court did find that the charges constituted rape, I think it's closer to they found that the allegations might reasonably constitute a sex crime and that Sweden has every right to criminalise sexual misconduct as its citizens see fit, and every right to pursue charges if they believe a crime has been committed, even if it isn't a crime in the UK or an explicit crime in the UK.",0,1364856940,null,0,false,0,c96laid,t3_1bcx54,t1_c96laid,t1_c9665eh,null,1431706403,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

This version doesn't die (well she does... but only for a few minutes) then joins the Doctor who has met her twice before- once as Oswin and once as Clara, on a linear path as his companion into the TARDIS to have amazing adventures. 

-Then some point in the far far far far future is Oswin Oswald, a shipwrecked Junior Entertainments Officer (is that a fancy way of saying a space nanny?!) who thinks she has evaded escape of the daleks when in actuality is a dalek having a conscious battle of self finally losing and essentially again 'dying'.

 It was a conscious decision on his part in an attempt to redeem himself. As seen with his interactions with Amy and Rory (and now Clara(s)) he wants to prove to himself that he can be more than just a lonely, miserable old man. 

This is why he picks up so many companions, so that he can maybe pass some of his wisdom onto them, to show them the universe. This version of the Doctor is still fighting away his inner demons and repressing his memories of all of the Time War and other tragic things he's witnessed, and he uses this schoolboy attitude and persona as a sort of coping mechanism.

true,MagmaSuperstar,somerset,Wurzel County UK,"I'm currently in the Netherlands studying for a masters degree so neither apply to me, my comments have been about my experiences during the year I took out to get money for further education.

However if a person is claiming job seekers allowance then they're likely to use it to buy petrol, you can claim reimbursement for the costs of fuel when attending an interview but as I said this takes forever and only comes after proof you attended anyway so not much good if you couldn't afford to go. Not to mention the jobcentre I went to was pretty quiet about telling you you could get reimbursements. There was no mention of it when you told somebody you had an interview, no information about how to claim it and it's not easy to find on the government benefits website at first glance.

As for the suggestion of selling the car. First of all it assumes the car had enough value to make it worth reselling, at the time I was using a second hand Fiesta that had only passed it's last two MOTs because of my father's mechanical ability. It was old, beat up and had some serious miles on the clock since it was my first car after passing my test if I was to sell it I'd have most likely gotten next to nothing. 

Secondly assuming I wasn't in the relatively easy position I was, what if I had a family with kids I had to pick up from school. Or had to do the main weekly shop which in my area is cheaper if you go a little up the motorway to a big outlet store. Even ignoring that the majority of my interviews and the job I ended up taking was in Bristol, a journey from where I live to the center costs about £4 worth of fuel a bus ticket costs £6. Not to mention having used that bus service while getting into college it's not unheard of for the bus to be late or else not bother to turn up at all. You get a small amount of money for the sale of the car and end up worse off in the long run because you still have to get places but you have to do so by public transport. Considerations of long term cost over short term gain is a fairly basic consideration when budgeting money.

Anyway I was regularly going into town to ask businesses for work, to talk to recruitment agencies as well as attend interviews and a lot of businesses have offices outside of main town areas because the rent is cheaper. Half the places I had interviews in I'd have struggled to get there by bus and if I did it would have involved two or three different services there and back which can get costly. That's not even beginning on trains, which make me eternally grateful I had a student railcard at the time.",0,1364860194,null,0,1364860605,0,c96mmfn,t3_1bf6yl,t1_c96mmfn,t1_c96lvrt,null,1431705776,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"While you're sort of right, there's a few things that are rather misleading in your post. Firstly, the financial crisis came as a result of bad loans, bank collapses and the stock market crashing. The economic crisis did not. The economic crisis was mainly due to Gordon Brown running a much higher budget deficit than necessary during a ""boom"" - when, in theory, you should be running a budget surplus. 

Furthermore, Labour were also planning a lot of spending cuts, just slightly less than the Tories. While I agree that the cuts are excessive and some are poorly aimed, Labour wouldn't have done much differently (I don't see Ed Balls pointing out where he would've put the cuts instead, or who he would've taxed instead of the ""bedroom tax""). Equally, keeping the corporation taxes high is a bad idea. You want to lower corporation taxes to encourage investment and employment. 

Labour ran us into the ground by spending money when we should've saved, selling our gold reserves and generally fucking up our economy a lot more in the last year or 2 of their term because they knew they were going to lose the election. The Conservatives have done a pretty decent job - a lot better than the French (socialist) government, the Italian government and many other 1st world countries in keeping the recovery more or less on track. The double dip was obviously not great, and as I said, I don't agree with the huge amount of cuts, but some were needed and they're still spending.

&gt;The Security Service, commonly known as MI5 (Military Intelligence, Section 5),[2] is the United Kingdom's internal counter-intelligence and security agency and is part of its core intelligence machinery alongside the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) focused on foreign threats, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Defence Intelligence (DI). All come under the direction of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC). 

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5)

So we've established that it's now called The Security Service (probably to avoid constantly being held up as an example of an oxymoron) and that oversight is provided by the JIC.

Who's on the Joint Intelligence Committee?
&gt;Membership comprises the heads of the three collection agencies—the Secret Intelligence Service, Security Service and GCHQ—the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence Staff, the Chief of the Assessment Staff, representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other departments, and the Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs.

So what we can see is that there's a lot of defence department overview of the SS. *Ohhhhh* the SS that's why they prefer MI5...

Have you tried putting your music on and going up to her flat to listen?
People as a rule don't like to complain without a reason - if she is, then maybe you should take a leap of faith and go up to her flat when your music is on and see for yourself?

Maybe there's a structural or soundproofing issue there? Until you see for your self, you can't say for sure there's no sound issue in her flat.

Very least you could do - you cannot say there's not a problem on her end until you're willing to pop up there and give it a listen.

We offered our former neighbour the chance to do that. There was a massive issue in her flat with the laminate flooring and no soundproofing, so it was incredibly noisy in our flat.


She's telling you it's noisy, but you're not willing to even entertain the notion that it could be that possibly, in her flat, your music is audible and is loud. What do you possibly have to lose by at least trying that?
 All I suggested was you try and see it from her POV and pop your music on, go up to her flat and see if you can actually hear it. If you really feel that's unreasonable then fair dos, but I can't see why it is. Until you see for yourself, you *cannot* say it's not a problem.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"It might lead to a few decisions not to hire or job losses in low quality employment scenarios, that's true, but the weight of research suggests that the additional money all those people who receive minimum wage receive more than offsets this in terms of providing a boost to the economy.  Right wing economists only like to talk about invisible costs of social programmes and the like, but they often ignore the positive externalities - more people with more money to spend = greater demand, more purchases of goods and services, and ultimately more jobs for others. I only have access to some very old figures, but even back in 2007 - in better times, before the crisis - there were 1.5 million workers on minimum wage, many of whom would doubtless have been paid considerably less without it, that's a nice injection into the economy which is clearly going to be larger now, certainly as a proportion and arguably in raw numbers.

Overall, the sum of the research seems to be that the employment effect of minimum wage is pretty much neutral, controlling for whatever else might be going on in an economy, and in the meantime, a lot of people end up with a  better standard of living.  Indeed, if you look at countries with significantly better or worse minimum wages than the UK, the unemployment situation seems to be at most unrelated, or even better in places with more narrow income ranges (brought about by higher safety nets, minimum wages,etc.).",0,1364870437,null,0,1364879412,0,c96q5wu,t3_1bh2lu,t1_c96q5wu,t1_c96nv16,null,1431704096,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

i completely agree with what you said. me and rest of the crew are passionate Manchester United fans, but we are football fans first and foremost. we just love the game. we started this podcast idea less than 2 months back and thought of making it Manchester United specific, hence the name ""United Fancast"".

but that didnt satisfy us because it was so limiting. we wanted to talk about other clubs, general football issues (video technology, for examples) and meet mature fans from other clubs. so, we kicked off the new ideas and themes. this Chelsea podcast that you just listened to, was our first attempt at something like this. hence, we played with the meaning of original podcast name ""United Fancast"", and turned it into one that represents mature football fans of each club that appears in the podcast, and are United in their love of football and spreading knowledge by discussing and debating topics in a podcast, led by fans, hence a Fancast.

we want to make all future podcasts more detailed and quality oriented, but the main problem is we need to build contacts with mature fans from every club (at least the major ones). Rylan (Chelsea61, the special guest in this segment) was the first, and so far only, Chelsea fan that agreed to be a part of the podcast. 

we will find more mature Chelsea fans, and our contact list is building fast. within the past 24 hours itself we have found 3 Barca fans, 2 Dortmund fans, one Arsenal fan, 1 Spurs fan, etc that are willing to take part in future podcasts for themes and topics that relate to them.

there will be more Chelsea-specific episodes in the near future, and we are working on making every future podcast more quality oriented (not just the Chelsea ones). we ask you to bear with us for now, while we try to build quickly to the future quality levels that you, all football fans, and that we expect from ourselves in the future.

we plan to redo this podcast in the near future, when we recruit a couple more Chelsea fans that wish to appear in the podcast and debate the issues/topics concerning Chelsea.

However, you should be aware that British degrees do not usually have any kind of ""liberal arts"" requirement - if you sign up to study subject X, then that's all you'll be studying.  I hear that in the US you require your students to take a variety of liberal arts classes alongside their major?  We don't do that.

Edit: some further remarks.  

We don't use the term college (except for Oxford and Cambridge students).  If you tell someone you go to college, they will assume that you mean *further education college* rather than university.

The [Russell Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russel_Group) of universities is the rough equivalent of your Ivy-league.

British degrees are offered either *with honours* or *without honours*.  Most students take their degree with honours.  The main difference is that honours students need to complete a dissertation.

Upon completion of your degree you will be awarded a grade:  either *first class* (the highest grade), *upper second-class (2:1)*, *lower-second class (2:2)* or *third class*.

Most degree programmes last three years.

Some universities offer four-year ""integrated masters"" which have names like MMath and MSci.  Despite their name, they are not widely considered to be true masters degrees - something you need to bear in mind if you want to go on to PhD-level study.

You saw flashes of his old self with his little bit of skill on the touchline and his almost-assist to Benayoun... and obviously his penalty miss was deflating.

Long story short: 

Chelsea should have never paid the pricetag that they did for El Nino.  It wasn't an accurate price for what he was able to accomplish on the field and ended up putting a tremendous amount of pressure on a striker that simply didn't fit the system that Chelsea had in place.  (And don't blame Fernando, blame Chelsea for actually paying that shit.)

He was injured going into the contract.  On top of that, he was out of form and he has not been the same since.  He is a quality striker that can excel in the right system but at the moment, this is not the system.  Will he score as the season progresses? Sure, he will be at the right spot at the right time... occasionally.  But will he be the menace that hoarded goals at Liverpool ?  No, unfortunately he will not.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; You can point out how bad rules are and discuss with the mods about how to improve them, we like that, but the discussion about your particular post of stamps is over.

Actually, no, you don't like that, or you'd be having that discussion here.  You're not.  Instead you're being defensive.  Meanwhile, the dscussion about my particular post is not over, as clearly demonstrated.  You are, of course, free to stop discussing it, since you don't want to admit it was in error.

&gt; We could argue all day about whether or not ""real life"" pictures of stamps are different enough to not count as a repost of other posts and pictures made about stamps, but this thread is done.

We don't need to argue all day; we would both agree that ""real life"" pictures do not count as a repost of other posts and pictures about stamps three months in advance.  Don't we?  Just as we would both agree that ""real life"" discussions about a doctor who episode do not count as a reposts of other posts and pictures about the same episode three months in advance.

But let's not miss the fact that you claimed ""There are multiple posts of people talking about the stamps, one of which features a person holding the stamps themselves"" when in fact there was no such picture.  There was one of someone holding the stamp booklet, again, long ago, before the stamps were out.

In any case, this thread is not done.  Again, you are free to leave it if you don't want to admit your error.

&gt; Two mods have already said that this post isn't different enough.

Then two mods are wrong.  That doesn't change anything.

&gt; But like PCJonathan said, you can message the mods to get them all to rule in on it if you want.

But like I said, past experience has shown messaging the mods is useless; your reactions in this thread only further demonstrate that.  But I have no interest in getting them all to rule; this thread isn't about that.  It's about telling people I'm leaving because the rules and mods are bad and they should feel bad for ruining great, desirable content in this subreddit.

I like your solution. I've been thinking something similar.

I would ask Lennon to provide width from either wing, and Bale to come in off the wing. Given his recent shooting, it'd be interesting to play Bale on the right and allow him to come in on his stronger foot, dribble, and shoot, similar to Hulk's role at Porto under AVB.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"   If I can cross my sports for a moment, Holtby reminds me of a rookie point-guard in the NBA; flashes of brilliance, sees the game preposterously well, but doesn't quite have the feel of the league yet to know when/how to make all the passes he sees.
   The bad news is that in the short term, it means he's going to give the ball away a fair bit, get frustrated, and generally have a very boom-or-bust impact on games.
   The good news is that vision is one of the true intangibles in football that simply can't be taught, and one of the most important in a world-class player. The difference between Neymar &amp; Messi isn't technical; it's that Messi reads the game, sees the game so well that his mind is 2 or 3 steps ahead of where he is physically. Bale has started to make that same leap; the goal this past weekend was a perfect example of knowing that while he had space, if he hit it as quickly as he could, it didn't have to be placed perfectly in the top corner; Vorm just had zero chance to react.
   That's where Holtby could be. He's *that* good mentally with the game. I think AVB is bringing him along slowly, which is good. 
   The other thing I've noticed is that Holtby brings a really good spark off the bench in the second half; where most players need 5 or 10 minutes after they come on to get into the flow of the game, Holtby just sprints on and goes for it. It sometimes gets him into trouble, but more often than not he affects play in a positive manner very quickly. Bringing Holtby on for Gylfi, rather than the other way around, maximizes everyone's impact on the game.",0,1364880086,null,0,false,0,c96szvp,t3_1bfif9,t1_c96szvp,t3_1bfif9,null,1431702760,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

But physics still has a lot to understand. Before quantum mechanics we had a very flawed physics.  QM overturned a lot of science. We do not have any theory of quantum gravity, and many corners of QM are still a bit spooky and to be explored. Why can particles have instantaneous connection, even if you accelerate one and its time frame changes relative to the stationary particle it is still connected to?  In effect two particles in different times are connected directly in one aspect.  Might this lead to temporal manipulation someday? Who knows.  But it is not in the same class of speculation as telepathic dragons and magical leprechauns. I'm open to a possible scientific way to do time travel, but not to magic Irishmen.

Time travel has always been an acceptable part of science fiction, yet not classed as outright fantasy. Probably because it posits there will be a higher physics understanding  someday that may enable it.  We've had imaginative physics speculations of wormholes maybe plausibly being able to connect past and future in a continuum.

3: The Three Doctors, Death to the Daleks

4: Most are good, I'd just watch.

5: Similar, most are good. Caves of Androzani is considered to be one of the best serials. The Five Doctors is entertaining.

6: Revelation of the Daleks, The Two Doctors (second is not particularly good, but it's cool to see Patrick Troughton again). Honestly, most of Colin Baker's serials are rubbish, but his Big Finish audio shows are generally very good.

7: Curse of Fenric, Survival

8: Watch the movie just because you can get it done in one sitting. Most of Paul McGann's material is Big Finish audio shows, of which I recommend Zagreus (40th Anniversary Special), Storm Warning (the first one), The Four Doctors, Situation Vacant, and Shada.

Maybe it's 70 instead of 80k/wk. 

Actually, Downing wasn't worse than Carroll last season. Downing created chances last season, they just weren't put away. Downing's shooting last season was awful, but his role first and foremost is to supply chances, and he did that; assists require someone to finish the chances, and last season wasn't great for that.

He might be very good 3-4 years from now, but is it worth paying him 80k/wk for 3-4 years to see that happen? And will he reach that level 3-4 years from now while starting most games on the bench? This is all before any considerations of how he'd fit for Rodgers and whether he's a legitimate plan B.

Under different circumstances, i.e. if Comolli hadn't made the worst fucking deal of the century in giving a player with half a year of Premier League experience a hefty first-team salary, I'd be more than happy to retain Carroll. But the facts are: the longer he spends at Liverpool as a bench player, the lower his value - and we're already going to take a hit on his value no matter what; at no point in the next 2-3 years will he be worth the salary he's being paid; **and, most crucially, the transfer fee and wages freed up by selling him could definitely be put to much better use for us right now, in comparison with keeping him.** ",0,1364895346,null,0,false,0,c96ve9v,t3_1bfikw,t1_c96ve9v,t1_c96p26p,null,1431701629,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The biggest changes that happened:

- Benefit cap (to start from April 15)
TL;DR: Nobody will be able to receive more than the average wage in benefits which is set at 26k. Actually equal to ~33k income before tax.

- Spare Room Subsidy (i.e. 'bedroom' tax). 
TL;DR: No longer allowed to have spare bedrooms if you receive housing benefit. 

- Universal Credit 
TL;DR: Aims to replace 16 different possible benefits with 1 payment. This is beginning but won't be in place for some time.

Other reforms that aren't quite welfare are stuff like Legal Aid, Council Tax benefits being administered by Councils rather than central gov't. Housing benefit to be given to people directly rather than to landlords. 

As for the consequences. If you believe the left/labour/guardian the very fabric of society is about to collapse. if you believe the right/tory/telegraph the changes are supported by the majority of people and aim to make things fairer whilst reducing cost.

You can book up to three months in advance to get the cheaper fares, so this depends how certain you are on your travel plans. 
You can book tickets without having your YPrailcard in your hand, but when (not if) your tickets are checked you'll have to have the railcard.

* Economic independence. Ie, giving more to central government than is received and not being *completely* dependent on another country economically.
* Have a parliament capable of legislation on *all* matters, especially foreign affairs.
* A majority of people in Wales vote for it.
* Westminster grant independence (more crucial than one might think)
* And semi-optionally, be recognised by a lot of other foreign countries as an independent and sovereign state.

If upon independence you immediately have to cut half the government services then no one's going to vote for it, unless it's part of some democratic communist revolution. You probably could become independent without that sort of economic independence, but you might still end up with a relationship similar to that of Italy and the Vatican.

He doesn't act as though he loves her, at least not in the way modern Western society would expect a husband to love his wife. To me it seems more like he views her as a duty, maybe even a burden almost. 

I also would say that I don't think they were really married. She claimed what he told her then was to look in his eye. Which would also invalidate all the theories about her knowing his true name because he told her in the ceremony. AND since he saved time then and so that moment no longer exists anyway, so wouldn't they not be married? That part of history never happened now. Or did I miss something? 

In that wedding moment I sensed not a bit of love from him towards her. I also get the feeling that she ""loves"" the Doctor because she is supposed to. She grew up knowing everything about him. I just get this feeling like she's doing what has been written for her, not because she really truly cares. Maybe in the end she does, but even then I didn't really pick up on it.

I guess their story was inspired by The Time Travelers Wife. Good book. Good romance. I read it. The story of River and The Doctor is NOT a romance, in my opinion. Not really. Instead it is just two lives impossibly tied up together because time has made it that way. No feelings or emotions needed. 

Different Doctor, I know, but they are supposed to be the same person. When he lost, say, Rose - we saw true and utter devastation from him. Like he'd lost his best friend, the person who meant the most to him currently in all the worlds and space. Yet River gets carted off to jail and he doesn't even seem to care. Yes he still gets to see her, but I mean, come on! I think he showed more love towards all of his companions than he ever has towards River. She's the daughter of the Tardis (in a sense) so I just think he feels responsible for her. There's a difference between love and duty. They can be connected, but there is a difference.

&gt;Warrior (and the Liverpool reps who signed off on this) know they have a reliable base of fans, so the home kit is there for them. I wouldn't be surprised if they release some vintage kits or classic shirts or whatever to cash in/keep them happy. But the fact is that they know the Liverpool *brand* isn't going to change in the eyes of a large part of what's already the fanbase, so they're sticking fabric through a garbage disposal and hoping it attracts new audiences, or at least new customers, in different markets with different tastes (Asia, the Middle East, Guernsey, etc.). There's a Dilbert principle about this (and I'm paraphrasing) that smart people don't need your product, people with taste don't want your product and people without money can't afford your product - if Warrior are targeting that group of rich, tasteless morons without any football allegiance, that doesn't justify but does explain [how this shit could exist](http://cdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Liverpool-New-Kit-Cover.png).

Everything was all about the companions. They were the story, and that is continuing with Clara. Maybe I feel like it's not about the Doctor anymore?

And I agree with the ""Ta-Da! Everything's fine! Don't ask questions!"" because I really just don't see how all of that stuff fits together. Of course, I admit there are several episodes I just sort of zoned out while watching because Matt Smith's episodes didn't even catch my attention until like the end of season 6. And even then, I was disappointed like two episodes later. 

It also seemed like in the past there were things the Doctor tried not to do. Time had to stay a certain way at certain times. It seems now like absolutely nothing is a fixed point anymore. Everything gets changed whenever and nobody bats and eye. 

In ""Father's Day"" Rose tried to change the past and it was terrible. There were consequences. I don't see that anymore. I know it was 10 who had his whole ""Time Lord Victorious"" moment and realized the rules were't for him anymore, and that backfired. I would think that then 11 would realize some of the rules DO need to be followed. It just seems like they pick and choose when and where and there is no consistency to it. 

Blah. I don't know. But yes, I wholeheartedly agree. I'm still watching, but it was honestly almost a chore at times to get through some of the episodes. And I think that is sad.

Similar things have been done before, Matthew Parris a Tory MP took part in a World In Action documentary during 1984 requiring him to live in Newcastle for a week on £26.80, the then state social security payment set for a single adult by the government he supported as a Conservative. The experiment came to an embarrassing end when he ran out of money for the electricity meter, he resigned soon after for a career in TV.



Tower Block of Commons was a four-episode reality documentary show broadcast on Channel 4 in 2010 where four MPs had to spend time living in a variety of deprived housing estates around Britain. Ian Duncan Smith was supposed to take part but had to pull out after one episode after his wife took ill, he was replaced by Nadine Dorries who was later found to have cheated by smuggling in a £50 note in her bra.


I forget what it was called but Michael Portillo starred in a TV show in which he took over for one week the life, family and income of a single mother living on benefits in Wallasey.

The real hardship in living this way is that you must struggle day after day, week after week, year after year and there may never be a way out.

It's worth noting that neither Scotland nor Wales have enough devolution to become independent alone. That's why there were the negotiations between Salmond and Cameron as to how the referendum would be done. Westminster retains all powers relating to the constitution, and Scottish and Welsh independence is very clearly a constitution issue. So Wales wouldn't really need much power devolved to it before the referendum. It would need to have a referendum, but that wouldn't be *too* hard. The real issue is whether Wales would be able to have a functioning parliament *after* independence. Scotland currently can't legislate on a lot of matters, but those that are voting ""yes"" believe that the Scottish Parliament is capable of handling the new powers that independence would bring IE foreign and military affairs. This can't be said for Wales, but isn't too far from being a reality. I'm not fully aware how capable the Welsh Assembly is, and I highly doubt that it would be capable of handling itself as a sovereign state, but I don't think (based on my limited knowledge) it's that far behind the Scottish Parliament. Scotland is definitely *much* more capable, and Wales is definitely far behind Scotland, but it's hard to say how far behind.

(I know this is rambling a little, sorry)

Really, I think the only thing stopping Welsh independence is people not feeling Welsh enough. That, and a little bit of economic stuff. Legally Wales could quite easily start pushing for independence. Economically, it would have difficulties but then if Scotland becomes independent it is going to stop being subsidised by Westminster and thus lose money. So economics isn't *too* important.

One of the sticking points of Tottenham's football this year (and the second half of last season come to think of it) is the aimless possession. Just too many passes going sideways and backwards in the name of making successful passes. Every player is composed and makes the correct pass to keep the ball, unless of course, we're only one goal up, then that dissapears. :)

Anyway, I think its a big contributing factor as to why our strikers don't score. The chance creation is predictable and easy to defend. 

Now, if he calms down and finds his inner Zen, Holtby has the ball skills and potential to be our Silva/Mata/Cazorla but with more aggression. 

Without his influence we're in a provisional third place and we've scored 53 goals. Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea have all scored 59 and City 55 so we just about on par. When Holtby starts to click with the team and our attacks become harder to read, big, big, big things are going to happen.

true,haywire,eng-sussex,Brighton,"I've always thought that TV should be billed based on the shows you watch.

So say you pay a flat rate (or something based on what you can afford or how much you watch - bulk buying is cheaper, so say £10 for 3 shows, but £20 gets you 8 shows, £25 gets you 15, £30 gets you 20 or something), for example £15 a month to Service X, and watch Game of Thrones, The Wire, and The Walking Dead, £10 goes to HBO and £5 to AMC. It basically gets divided equally between them. Episodes would be available for live streaming, downloadable (won't affect piracy because getting things off the pirate bay is easier than begging your mate to copy a 2GB file to you), and watchable until the DVD/BRDVD comes out.

Available globally at the same time live (without translations, obviously) - I mean really what is the drawback of doing this.

Everybody wins!

Sure, shows like the X-factor would gross far far higher than Firefly, but the industry could invest the money from cheap-to-make populist shows in decent content.

This would also be far superior to the ""TV ratings"" system where a small selection of viewers effectively decide what the rest of us want.

Lets do some fairly ballpark maths.

So say I watched:

 * Adventure Time (Cartoon Network)
 * Community (NBC)
 * Game of Thrones (HBO)
 * Homeland (Showtime)
 * Justified (FX)
 * Parks and Rec (NBC)
 * Person of Interest (NBC)
 * Portlandia (IFC)
 * Revolution (NBC)
 * The Following (FOX)
 * The Walking Dead (AMC)

So, 11 shows, I'd happily pay £25/mo for them. 25/11 = £2.27

NBC gets £9.08, and the rest get £2.27 each. I expect that this is way more than they get for a single person's cable package.

The last episode of Game of Thrones had 4,400,000 viewers. Being that it was the most pirated show in 2012, having been downloaded ~25,000,000 times, if even 25% of pirates were converted, this would over-double to ~10,000,000 people.

The cost of making the pilot was around 6,500,000.

So lets see, 10,000,000 * 2.27 - 6,500,000 and we're netting £16,200,000 per episode, not including DVD sales. For one of the most expensive TV shows ever made.

I mean, it would be difficult to drag execs heads out of their arses, but dangling 22,700,000 gross per episode in front of their eyes...

He will be 32 early next season - perhaps he is seen as a means of easing some pressure off Gerrard? But, with another AM likely arriving, what will become of Jordan Henderson?

The yearly [GERS report](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS) was, apparently, a Conservative invention designed to show Scotland in a bad light (just as the McCrone Report had been buried by use of the Official Secrets Act to allow the findings of the Kilbrandon Commission - which claimed Scotland to be an economic basket case in need of perpetual subsidy - to stand). However, on taking up the reigns of government in 2007 the SNP found that there were many flaws in the way GERS report was being compiled;

* tax revenue being generated from whisky production being credited to England.
* tax revenue from oil production being credited to England.

When these issues were ironed out the figures looked much better. You need to have control over the economic data otherwise you will be told you are a basket-case economy and, like we in Scotland were told in the 70's, if we every became independent we would be as poor as Bangladesh.

Another area to look at would be your balance of trade - at present Wales is a net exporter of goods (not sure about services) - [graph](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/rts/Pages/default.aspx) and [spreadsheet download](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/RTS/RTS%20Releases/RtsQ42012.xls). This is harder to get to grips with as no data has been kept for intra-UK trade, however, in Scotland, Labour initiated the [Global Connections Survey](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/Exports/GCSIntroduction) which isn't without its faults, but cannot be too far from the truth and shows Scottish exports in a very healthy light.

But what he does have is a quality that is crucial for any Rodgers side: incessant energy, spirit and, most importantly, pressing. The hard, at times invisible, work. He has that dynamism and youthful desire to succeed you wouldn't have in a Lucas-Alonso-Gerrard midfield. Which one of those would harass the opposition's defenders, midfielders and forwards at any given time? And do that for the duration of a game? Henderson can do that. 

I feel a Lucas-Alonso-Gerrard midfield would be outplayed far too much when off the ball if it was to be a regular fixture. Of course, that is just my opinion and I will happily be proven wrong.

- TuGo is being positioned as an afterthought, or value added to existing contracts.

This is all wrong. TuGo inspired services should be offered not just as value added, but as purchasable services in their own right. Maybe I don't want a mobile phone. Maybe I just want TuGo. Maybe I want online access to my SMS, voicemail, call history and calls anywhere in the world from my web browser.

- There are threats from similar services

Google Voice is going full throttle in the USA, and could come to the UK at any time. I don't just mean with their current UK presence as a webapp dialer, but as a complete alternative to existing telephony networks like they are in the USA. O2 can counter this by getting there first. It needs TuGo with voicemail and transcription ('visual voicemail' as Appletards call it). It needs a fuller and better prepared web presence.

- An end to roaming

With TuGo, like other UMA services you do not need to be within the home country to dial out - just need internet. Yet O2 are constraining this service to devices which can run its relatively poorly rated client. Open it up to all SIP devices. This extends the service to people running their own telephony networks and linking in. This is a whole new revenue stream for systems like Asterisk and Trixbox. O2 could take on the existing VOIP market. Absolutely none of them currently offer two way SMS for example.

- Base station extension

If it still had a broadband network, it could have allowed the use of customers access points as easy TuGo gateways, extending their network reach for every customer. They could have even increased broadband loyalty by giving customers a cut of the revenue.

- The future

With present trends, it is likely at some point each network will just become a infrastructure provider. With calls happening over IP networks which the Cell networks themselves don't necessarily own. This is a future where O2 own backhaul and masts, with very little if any direct customer interaction. O2 by acting now can preserve its presence and take a slice of the pie from future competitors.",0,1364907994,null,0,false,0,c96x67p,t3_1bcy7l,t1_c96x67p,t1_c96wxeb,null,1431700721,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

OneArmJack made the point that 35% of eligible voters voted for him in the last election, yet only 0.15% of eligible voters voted for him to live on £53 a week - thereby castrating the impact of the fact that over 50,000 people would like him to do this, and making it all seem like a pretty silly fuss about nothing.

My point was that the group of people that were eligible to vote for him in the last election is astronomically smaller than the group of people that are eligible to vote for him to live on £53 a week.  The election would have been remarkably better advertised than this petition (which I - and I'd imagine most people here - only know about due to this thread), to an audience that is a fraction of the size of the group of eligible petition signers.  

Why on earth would you expect the ratio of active voters to even remotely compare to the elections?  To my mind, OneArmJack made a snide attack upon the outcome of the petition by employing a set of statistics that are heavily weighed in favour of his bias.

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;Perhaps he is thinking of a Lucas/New DM, Gerrard/Alonso/Allen, New AM/Henderson/Allen system?

That's more or less my thoughts on this. I see Allen (if he sticks around) the long term replacement for Gerrard (yes another one), so having Alonso around for 2-3 years should help Allen develop.

I'm amazed Gerrard has played as much as he has this year, so having cover for him both in terms of experience and positioning on the field is very important - there's the worry that he'll suffer a long term injury again at any point which would leave our midfield horribly inexperienced. Having Alonso would let Gerrard rest more frequently, but also play at a higher intensity further up the pitch if needs be. He might not have the legs to play in a forward midfield position for 90, but he might for 60-70 once in a while, if he can rest the next game and Alonso takes over.

As to what happens to Henderson &amp; Shelvey, I think that'll depend on what happens to Downing. If he goes, there'll be a spot for players to rotate there. If he stays I could see 2-3 of Shelvey, Suso and Sterling going out on loans.
