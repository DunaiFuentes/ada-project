In principle, is it acceptable when someone living beyond their means in an area they cannot afford to live in in the long term to be asked to leave that area and settle for what the vast majority of the wider population have to live with on a regular bais, or should the state spend tens of thousands if pounds to make sure that doesn't happen.

Secondly he get alot of praise when he does well and gets alot of critisism when hes playing poorly. For example earlier in the season when we was still getting used to his new position alot of the fans gave him so much stick; but now look at him hes doing great as a deep lying play maker.

For me Gerrard can do no wrong and if he wants to still play at the age of 40 he should be allowed (like giggs). His influnce over me and the club as a whole is so imense i pretty much grew up watching him so i have a huge soft spot for him. Lots of fans on this sub are quite new so i dont expect them to fully understand gerrard but during 2000s he was the best thing at the club. He would change games, like literally every time liverpool would be losing i wouldnt be upset because he always gave me the belief that at any second now we will turn it around. Before the game all the talk would be how does the opposing team stop Gerrard. Even when torres was there he was our best players. I dont know how new of a fan you are but to truely understand how great of servent he has been to this club you wouldve had to watch him at that time. Some seasons we were called a 1 man team even.

Excuse me? Have I missed something? When I bought my home, I chose a property and a mortgage I could reasonably afford and accepted that I couldn't have my dream house in the best area because I couldn't afford it and that if I lost my job or spent more than I earned, I'd lose my home. That's how it works. That's life.

The idea that the interest only loans were missold is untrue - at least in my experience.

Many of them have the mortgages expiring at their retirement age and want it to continue on to death, which lenders are not prepared to do.

Banning political groups *is* fascist, it's easy and it's dumb. The moral thing to do is some times the hardest thing to do, fight to the death for the rights of *everyone* not just those you agree with. The EDL will hide behind this, use it and try and twist it but never, ever, feel guilty or complicit for doing what is right because while the EDL think they win by being allowed to exist their position is one that is flawed and will wither and die under the exposure to education and vocalised opposition.

The reason for banning them would not be because they have differing views, its because they're violent and propose the use of violence against others. In this sense its not that different from banning a group of football hooligans or a gang of kids. Just because they have a slight political arm does not automatically mean they can go around beating people up I would even argue that the fact that they have a political arm is an even stronger argument for banning them; political groups should not have any ties to criminal or violent organisations. 

Also, credit where credit is due Hitler, Mussolini and Franco wanted to organise the people to form a revolution based on populist ideals in order to create a sort of supreme nationalistic society where everyone who didn't think like this would be imprisoned or worse.

YOU HAVE NO VALUE TO ANYONE WITH YOUR ""OPINION"", YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO DEFEND OR JUSTIFY ANYTHING TO A STANDARD THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU LOOK RETARDED TO ANYONE WHO IS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU, WHICH IS VIRTUALLY EVERYONE.

the only value to conversing with you, is it makes me appreciate the capabilities and coherence of people I associate with professionally, and thank fuck society has all sorts of rules and norms that keep people like you from ever having influence over anything.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"You are quite right in your intuition Stillwater: housing benefit distorts the property market.

Everyone will spend money much more freely if it is coming from someone else's pocket. When people do not even see the money directly (like housing benefit) there is no reason not to spend as much as possible. A better idea might be to give claimants the money directly, and let them decide whether to spend it on rent, food, transport, horse masks or whatever they want.

Let us take 2 situations:

1) You have a yearly net income (either from work or benefits it doesn't matter) of £30,000. You decide to spend £10K on rent and £20K on everything else. If £10K doesn't get you a place in London then you can live elsewhere. Sounds pretty sensible right? Everyone is happy and **you spend the money as you see fit.** 

2) You have a yearly net income of £10K cash and £20K worth of housing benefit vouchers. Obviously you spend £20K in housing benefit on housing, and 10K in cash on everything else. The problem is that **you would actually prefer to spend just £10K on housing and keep the rest in cash. But you can't do that.** You lose out on buying what you really want (food or holidays etc) because you have to spend more money than you want on housing. **You have lost out in happiness / utility terms despite spending the same amount of money** / benefit. You 'buy' more housing than you really want to, simply because you are given housing 'vouchers' not actual cash.

The people who really benefit (in option 2) are the landlords who now enjoy artificially high demand for property, driven by the flood of government money **that must be spent on housing**. This creates artificially high demand for housing (which is already high in London and elsewhere) thus raising prices. These are the real beneficiaries of housing benefit, as they can raise prices very easily as the government will foot the bill whatever.

If you simply gave everyone £30K in cash, there would be no problems. Some people would decide to move and spend their money not on rent, but on food / clothing etc. The problem is that giving people 'vouchers' rather than cash can do odd things to the market. Sadly, hardly anyone in the government has studied economics leading to all sorts of silly mistakes like this.

Yes, absolutely if they desire to have an organisation like that then it should exist. Why on earth not? I'm actually really starting to think you might be a fascist now, proscribing organisations just because you don't like what they stand for? That's absurd man!

No, I wouldn't. I have no issue with the UK communist party, a UK nazi party, the UK whatever party. That's fine.

The plan is that the fund will grow over time as those investments increase in value.

If all goes according to plan, at the end of your mortgage your fund will be worth more than the original loan, so you can pay that back PLUS a bit more for you to buy a porche with and go on a cruise or whatever.

Unfortunately, the stock market crashed in 2008 so a lot of these funds lost money and will not be big enough to pay back the original loan. Thus, at the end of the mortgage people will still owe money to the bank and may have to sell 'their' home.

A road can handle a certain number of cars before you end up with congestion. This only gets worse with things like junctions, traffic lights, bridges. If you are going to build massive numbers of new houses in an area it is not enough just to connect them to the road system, all of these need to be improved to handle the new demands being placed on the transport system. There needs to be more investment in trains, new buses bought, new schools built. These all cost money and are exceptionally expensive. The natural reaction for people living in the area who don't want to be affected by all this is to oppose construction, resulting in NIMBYism.

Social housing is a lot more than just building some new homes. It transforms entire communities, affects property prices, and costs a massive amount of money.

No its not. Social Housing is building or aquireing existing stock.

I think your confusing Social Housing Providers (whom are not the council any more) with your local council. Whom will conciser local planning issues such as traffic and fund it via Council Tax Collections and levies on new build properties.

&gt;cost of land and the difficulty in buliding accumulates until it becomes economically irrational to build

PRS do it fine

MK is very modern, huge shopping centre and a lot of country areas.

Woburn, Flitwick, or Ampthill are very close if you fancy a small commute but want to live in a safe, friendly small town. 

Milton Keynes is great though, the train is ideally placed for all the bigger cities, Birmingham and London etc. Coach services run straight to MK as well, so you have cheap travel options. 

It's different. It is one of those places that people label as concrete and far too 'shit'. But the fact is, it's in one of the nicer areas of the country, it's close to London, and the prices of housing aren't hugely reflective of that. 

Put simply: Lots of jobs, It is nowhere near as shit as people make it out to be, it's extremely close to everywhere, it's slap bang in the middle of some gorgeous scenery, and it is nowhere near too costly. 

However, the shopping centre attracts a huge amount of people as it is one of the larger ones in the area. It's also seen as one of the 'bigger' nights out for young people in the home counties so they often end up in the club/bar area.

* First take a copy of the spreadsheet.
* Edit your deposit, and
* The upper and lower limits of the price of house you are looking to buy in your area.
* You can also edit the term, but I think it's best to get the max length you can.

When getting a mortgage, getting the best LTV (loan to value) is important as the interest rate you will pay will be cheaper. (I always think of the interest you pay as rent to the bank)

So in the example spreadsheet, you can see that if you were to get a £200k house you would beable to get a 75% LTV which results in much lower payments, or you might try increasing your deposit to increase the maxium you can borrow. 

Or looking at it the otherway you might want a 80% LTV, which means you can be looking for a house that costs upto £250k.

I also include a breakdown of the mortgage if the rates were to go up. You should really be able to pay the upper limit of this as the rate will almost certainly go up over the term of your mortgage.

Chances are it will be a secretary. Make yourself smile before phoning (this will come across on the phone) and be happy, confident and apologetic.

Hope that helps.

The problem at the moment is that there is lots of ""orphaned"" work which noone knows who the copyright owner is.

In actual fact the artist is a 42 year old mixed media artist from Guyana. Now someone wants to include the picture in a book except they don't know how to find this awesome artist or even who he is.

Under current legislation, they have to either not use that amazing scifi battle picture in their book, or use it but risk being sued for loads of money if the author turns up.

This legislation leads to a new way forward: they can make a decent effort to find the author, if that fails, then they can use it anyway and pay a market rate.

&gt;No significant recidivism rate differences are found between private and public prison inmates for adult males, adult females, or youthful offender males.

Here's the full summary of the paper:

&gt;A fundamental claim made in support of private prisons is that they
reduce state inmate recidivism. Current knowledge on this empirical
question is limited to three prior studies with problematic methodolo-
gies. To test this claim better, we use multiple measures of exposure to
private prisons to define and analyze multiple treatment/comparison
groups of private and public prison inmates. Multivariate survival anal-
ysis, controlling for a range of recidivism covariates wider than the
prior studies included, is used to compare reoffense and reimprison-
ment rate differences in a large cohort of Florida prison inmates
released from 1995 to 2001. No significant recidivism rate differences
are found between private and public prison inmates for adult males,
adult females, or youthful offender males.

true,hotcod,null,null,"Well this is the major point point, the act is not about letting people use works for free simply because no one knows who the owner is it's about not having worked locked simply because we don't know who the owner is. 

We automatically assign copyright at the point of creation of anything that can be copyrighted. Given that copyright then last the life of the author plus 70 years it's likely upwards of 100 years before anything created today would be useable in the public domain. Now think back to 100 years ago, a lot of history and culture has happened in that time and imagine trying to create a history book or a text book dealing with that culture. Imagine having to leave our meaningful or important work because no one knows who created it or, say, who owns the rights. 

The point of this act is to allow you to still pay to license that work instead of having to skip over it. It's making sure we don't lose our cultural history to bad bookkeeping.   

There's other reasons for it as well, culture and creation is a remix, everything is ( http://everythingisaremix.info/ ) and it's better for us cutlrally if we are not limited in the scope of what we can work with by lack of knowlage of the owners of that work. Sometimes you might find something perfect for a project or be inspired by something but be unable to track down the person who owns it to seek out licensing. Under these laws you could still pay for the work and if the owner turns up they still get paid and once identified the ability to license the work will return to it's place with that person. 

It creates a huge new market for things like stock images out of culture that could otherwise be lost or left unused for a century. There's room for abuse of course and I personally think that this is trying to fix a symptom of the problem instead of the actual problem (returning to having to register copyright instead of automatically assigning it) but this is law that will help preserve our culture and heritage while still attempting to make sure a person is compensated for the use of their work.

I didn't.

I was pointing out that unlike the majority of reports about the new law which claimed it was driven by big corporations, most of the demand has come from small scale operators and individuals who lack the resources to deal with tracking down copyright on 50 year old artworks.

There has been absolutely tons of examples given over the past few years about musicians etc unable to reliably mix old music files, reuse old photos, etc because the copyright has been untraceable.

That is what the orphan works legislation was set up to solve - and did so with the support of most of the creative industry.

...as to photographers, any idiot who thought about it would realise that a big agency attempting to ""nick"" a photo of (for example) St Paul's Cathedral and claim it was an orphan work is going to be laughed out of court, because any decent stock photo agency could supply a licensed copy of similar content.

It's where there is a dearth of alternative content that is also too difficult to source the origin for that this law protects the user -- while also ensuring that the copyright owner is compensated if they ever turn up.

Besides, housing doesn't have to cost that much in London. I know someone who lives in London (Camden). She earns less than I do.

Unfortunately that's not a trade off the government makes when it comes to housing benefits. I'm not against people staying in London at the taxpayer's expense if they really want, as long as the cost is the same.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"Actuaries don't make predictions, per se - that's for an economist.

Actuaries do however, make sure that whatever the trend in circumstances, that the outcome is known and within acceptable parameters.

In the case of buying a house, the key factors are inflation (assuming that the salary tracks inflation), and the interest rate.  In this case, once a solution is found assuming static income and costs, there was a step analysing what would happen as those rates changes.  This was around 9 years ago, btw.

If the inflation went low, and interests rates go high, that's the problem case, because the income is increasing slower than the expenditure.

There were some calculations, which I didn't understand, and they showed that she'd be fine provided the gap between them was less than  ... I forget the exact number - something like 10 points difference.  What ever the gap was, it was something that only occurred once ever since records began, and then only for a couple of months (right around one of the major stock market bubbles).  So the conclusion was that circumstances were not going to change in a way that adversely affected her as a result of the financial arrangements.

(If the inflation went up, then that's good for debt holders, and if interest rates went down, that's also good, so there was unbounded space on those sides that was ok.  If they both move in the same direction, that's also ok, as one effect balanced off the other.)

So, no, those events were not predicted - but they were not a problem.  The space that might cause problems was mapped out, and then those examined for likelyhood.  And some hedges applied - there was something about unemployment insurance to protect against loss of job for a period at the start, details escape me.

true,keozen,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"The bill is great, it releases the use of a lot of older works that are just gathering dust in places like the British Library. It does exactly what it was designed to do perfectly well. 

The only issue is that it opens up some legal loopholes that can be abused by people in order to get supposedly legal access to works that may not be orphan. 

The issue is the same as it is for a lot of newer bills, it just doesn't consider the technology well enough. For the purpose of my examples I'll say now, I'm not a photographer, I'm a comic artist and my concerns come from that angle (and echo those of a lot of my peers). 

Let's say Fred Bloggs at ""Dodgy Design Ltd"" needs a picture for the front of a brochure that he is designing for ""Nasty Mc Evil Enterprises"". He does some searching and finds a picture on Imgur that looks to suit his needs. It's a little cartoon bear. He looks to see if there is any metadata on the image, he then uses tineye and google search using images to see if he can backtrace it, he also uses a series of search terms ""Cartoon bear"", ""Small cute bear"" etc. Alas the image is actually a cropped image that was part of a full page image from Joe McCool's latest comic book, it was cropped, re-saved and re-hosted by someone because they thought it was cute and wanted to post it on /r/aww for sweet karma. As such none of the above searches as diligent as they were threw up any hits (myself and a few other artists ran a series of tests when this came up the other day, cropping things out of images we have up online, etc and then trying our best to find them starting from just the image, things like tineye and the google image search are great but their success rate isn't nearly as high as it needs to be for this to work, they miss a lot). 

""Dodgy Design"" then applies to use the image as an orphan work, uses it on a brochure for ""Nasty Mc Evil Enterprises"" and the damage is done.

If Jo McCool or one of his fans notice the use then Joe has provision to get paid for the use but he is still faced with the fact that his work was used to promote something that he didn't agree to. For all we know Joe is adamantly opposed to ""Nasty McEvil"" and now one of his characters just went out giving an endorsement to all their customers. 

Then what about things that aren't online. Think convention sketches. Scan a con sketch minus the signiature, get your cousin's mother's brother's dog to upload it to imgur and then ""find it"" and boom, you have high res line art that you can do a ""diligent search"" on and you have free legal use high res lineart.

Am I picking out the ""worst case scenarios"" yes of course I am, but the fact that they're technically possible under the bill is scary enough. A lot of the provisions seem to think that the only person putting an individual's work online is that individual and that is far from the reality of it so arguments like ""just make sure anything you put on the net is watermarked and meta tagged"" go out the window as does ""if you have a problem with it take your stuff off the internet"" we all know how well THAT worked for those Beyonce and Justin Beiber photos the other month. 

Honestly I'm not sure what I would suggest to fix it. I agree that we should have some way to make the old archive materials available while at the same time protecting those who want to keep their stuff under their own control. Maybe a system where before you can use an orphan work it goes up on a listing for x number of months where anyone can see and submit proof that it's their work and stop the process? The only issue is that that may have too many listings for anyone to be able to look through and check on a regular basis. I don't know, I'd love to hear some suggestions.

I was born in the middle of the afternoon
In a horse drawn wagon on the old a5
A big twelve wheeler shook my bed
You can't stop here the policeman said
Better get born some place else
Move along get along move along get along
Go move shift!

I was born on a common by a building site
Where the land was rutted by the trailers wheels
The local christians said to me
You're lowering the price of the property
Better get born some place else...

The winter sky was hung with stars
One shone brighter than the rest
The wise men came so stern and strict
And brought the order to evict
Better get born some place else...

I was born in a tatty lifting time
In an old bow tent in a tatty field
The farmer said the work's all done
It's time that you were moving on
Better get born some place else...

I was born at the back of a blackthorn hedge
When the white hair frost lay all around
No eastern kings came bearing gifts
No they said you'd better shit
Better get born some place else...

Wagon tent or trailer born
Last week last year or in far off times
Here and a thousand miles away
There will always be men who say
Better get born some place else...

I now get an earlier train than is strictly necessary as a matter of course because I don't want to get in trouble at the office... and it's not because my boss is awful or I'm bad at timekeeping, it's because I can't rely on the rail service.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;But the UK is driving a large wedge through established copyright law and the techdirt article neatly avoids any discussion of that.
&gt;Currently a photographer owns copyright in any photograph they've taken by virtue of being the creator of the work. This new legislation proposes to remove that right unless each individual photograph is registered with some, as yet non-existent, repository.

Except that not what is happening. A photographer will not lose his copyright on work until this copyright term is up. What this law does is allow the assigning of limited powers to licence that work to a independent agency if the person who owns the rights can't be found. 

You can already explicitly register work and this law may provoke the creation of services in which a person can store work in a way that can make sure they can be contacted for licensing (how awful to have a way of people who want to pay to use your work be able to easily get in contact with you) but you don't *have* to do that and you never lose your rights in your work at any point.  

&gt;So the 'diligent search' boils down to merely checking whether the photo you want to use is registered there. So now any designer wanting to illustrate an article, brochure, advertisement, website can just go out and take whatever they want wherever they can find it as long as it isn't in the offically-sanctioned registry.

We don't know how diligent search will actually be defined at this point and the idea that it will require people to have to register somewhere is idiotic. The whole point of this law is to avoid even thinking about returning to none automatically granted copyright so I'd be astounded (and somewhat pleased) if this law actually defined diligent search in such a way. It's just likely services like this will spring up so people can make sure their images can be identified as theirs, which is useful on many levels.

&gt;Anyone who ever submitted images to a stock library, or had any image used by a newspaper, magazine, website, ... has to now go back and pay to have their entire, already copyrighted, back catalogue 'properly' registered. The cost of being a professional photographer just rose again thanks to HMG.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"Words don't *suddenly* become unacceptable - at least not normally.

Some word gets used as an insult. That usage gets more common in certain groups. Others start recognising it as a common insult, and the offence at that spreads in certain groups.

Certainly the word ""retarded"" was used as an insult a lot in the 80s, and was considered offensive because of that. But ""Mental retardation"" is still an official term in the American DSM, at least up to IV (there's a DSM V now, but I don't know much about it). I'm English and I tend to use that term because ""learning disability"" is confusingly ambiguous - there's ""specific learning disabilities"" that aren't ""learning disabilities"" because ""learning disability"" mostly means low IQ (though low functioning is important to the definition) whereas ""specific learning disability"" includes things like dyslexia which are independent of IQ.

Anyway, there's a difference between a word being offensive and a word being used offensively.

A political-correctness ban-the-evil-word approach simply doesn't work IMO - ultimately the prejudice relates to the condition, not the word - making the words taboo doesn't change the attitudes so the prejudice continues and is just expressed differently. Informal language use is changing all the time anyway, so using different words is no big deal.

And in any case, some people use words specifically *because* they're taboo.

That's why I think if you want to change a prejudiced attitude, you fight the prejudiced attitude, not just some word. Sure it's harder to change the attitude, and if you succeed you may still have the word, but it's a bit like 10-year-olds calling things ""gay"" - it doesn't refer to sexual orientation any more than it refers to happiness. Making the word taboo, though, just means you've wasted time and effort making the word taboo - the prejudiced attitude behind it remains and still gets expressed in many other ways.

In fact political correctness is sometimes just another way of bullying people, particularly those who cannot keep up with what is or is not politically correct, or see people getting away with something in one context and don't understand that it's inappropriate in another context - which of course includes people with some kinds of learning disabilities.

Social housing is a dead end.

Government makes next to nothing off social housing, so there is no ""giving back"" to the taxpayer, and as the estates age they cost more and more to maintain, so councils in tight situations abandon some to the wolves and maintain others as best they can.

On that same day, Meir issued a personal appeal for military assistance, which European nations declined. U.S. President Richard Nixon, however, ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, to replace all of Israel's materiel losses.[5] The decision was taken the same day the Soviets began their own resupply operation of Arab forces by sea.[6] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger had told Anwar El Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to ""going nuclear.""[3]",0,1367510128,null,0,false,0,c9r1k0m,t3_1dgj43,t1_c9r1k0m,t1_c9qfmdy,null,1431348819,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

* Coutinho (currently 20-years-old) has almostly instantly shown more energy, creativity, promise, confidence, and fearlessness that we have yet to see in other promising youngsters like Jonjo (21), Borini (22), Suso (19), Sterling (18), Joe Allen (22).

* If Coutinho continues to progress to Luis Suarez's age (26) the sky is the limit. Coutinho could be a play-maker extraordinaire: popping up with amazing goals, buckets of assists. Maybe even a striker? Why not?

* And I suppose the difficulty in this question is how we define ""better."" It's more of a philosophical question, I suppose. Some may hold the striker in higher regard while others may say the striker would be nothing with the support of a Coutinho-esque player.

Ultimately, for me, the question comes down to: Will a 26-year-old Coutinho become a more valuable player than Suarez was at 26 for LFC?

I personally think, yes. Coutinho will ultimately make more contributions to the club as a whole and become better than Suarez.

What he said, I'm fairly sure is a reference to the facts that kids of that age do seem to know a lot more about sex than, say from his POV, 40-50 years ago.  It's also dug out from 8 years ago, and may or may not be relevant.

You've only got to hop on a bus to hear kids half that age using every swear word going. I've heard 'fuck off mum' yelled from one end of the bus to the other, and I shudder to think what a slap I'd have got for that!

Of course it's rather creepy now we know, but if it had come from someone not accused of what he's been up, I'd not really have a problem with it.  Also, given that he's up for 13 charges of rape and underage sexual assault, really, does it matter if he said something untoward on the radio?  They're not going to add another couple of days to his sentence for it.

It's the whole reason why Midnight is so terrifying. We have no clue what this ""thing"" is and how can we defeat something when we have no idea how it ""infects"" us...

And for that reason specifically, I wouldn't mind revisiting the actual planet again in a different way.

1. Vincent and the Doctor (19)

2. The Girl in the Fireplace (13)

3. The Doctors Wife (15)

4. Closing Time (51)

5. Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (10/30)

6. Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone (66/63)

7. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (8/45)

8. The Girl who Waited (28)

9. Father's Day (61)


Vincent because it is a beautiful episode, and reveals that although the Doctor can handle the nastiest of external monsters, he is no better than anyone else with internal monsters and can't defeat the ultimate monster in the episode (depression).

The Girl in the Fireplace because it was an all around great episode. Funny and tragic at the same time.

The Doctor's Wife because it was such a fun episode, exploring the Doctor's relationship with the TARDIS, and it's relationship with the Doctor.

Closing Time because it was such a fun episode. The Doctor dealing with a baby, and playing like a child in the toy store. Yet this levity was masking and dealing with his sadness at being so old, seeing people disappear from his life.

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. Interesting episodes on their own, but it's interesting in that they actually become more poignant with time. When you first watched the episodes, you saw the end of some random new character, but as the show goes on you become more emotionally vested in the character, so that episode hits you harder each time you watch it, knowing that is how she ends.

Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone because of the angels. Daleks tend to be comical villains. You know that the Doctor is always going to best them. The angels are a bit different. They are more menacing and there is much more of a sense of danger to them, that even though the Doctor will of course be okay, they may take out anyone else, including companions.

The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances because they are interesting, kind of creepy episodes. Are you my mummy?

The Girl Who Waited- An interesting, emotional look at devotion and abandonment.

Father's Day- Quite an emotional rollercoaster, as Rose has her idealized images of her father destroyed upon actually getting to see and know him, yet restored in a different way with his sacrifice for her.",0,1367512742,null,0,1367515260,0,c9r2hlk,t3_1djric,t1_c9r2hlk,t3_1djric,null,1431348379,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Cattle testing and culling of cattle and badgers on affected farms nearly eradicated bTB in the years between the '30s and the late '70s (testing of milk cattle turns up in the James Herriot books as a new thing then). Affected cattle were culled, the local badgers were gassed (in their setts) in concentric rings around an affected farm until none tested positive. 

Some combination of the almost complete eradication of bTB along with rising animal rights sentiment led to several Acts that *banned gassing* on welfare grounds, removed the expensive requirement to cull badgers around TB-affected farms, and protected badger populations from other disturbance. 

The inefficiency of culling via traps/shooting compared to gassing may be a big reason why the Krebs trial showed little benefit to culling when earlier trials (like [the Thornbury trial (p2)](http://www.bovinetb.info/docs/Gallagher.pdf), which gassed setts whole) showed bTB cases in cattle and badgers could be much reduced by culling the local badger population in areas where the disease was endemic. bTB is a foul disease and I don't really understand why gassing remains forbidden - immediate welfare issues would be more than made up by the benefits of a reduced or eliminated level of bTB. 

Even ignoring bTB, I think there's a good case for allowing badger culling under licence in areas where it's shown that the population is increasing and causing problems (either disease or to farming). Badgers have no natural predators - either humanity or disease is going to control their numbers.

Again, the terms don't make it terribly clear either way, but from what I can make out from that and other services you would be entitled to compensation up to the cost of the ticket.

So, say that your train was cancelled and they had a bus ready, and you arrived less than an hour later, you still may be entitled to compensation as you lost your reserved seat. If you arrived more than an hour late, you would be entitled to compensation for both the loss of your seat and the late running.

&gt; **116A Power to provide for licensing of orphan works**

&gt; (1) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for the grant of
   licences in respect of works that qualify as orphan works under the
  regulations.

&gt; (2) The regulations may—

&gt; ↳ (a) specify a person or a description of persons authorised to grant
    licences, or

&gt; ↳ (b) provide for a person designated in the regulations to specify a
  person or a description of persons authorised to grant licences

&gt; (3) The regulations must provide that, for a work to qualify as an orphan
   work, it is a requirement that the owner of copyright in it has not been
  found after a diligent search made in accordance with the regulations.

&gt; (4) The regulations may provide for the granting of licences to do, or
   authorise the doing of, any act restricted by copyright that would
  otherwise require the consent of the missing owner.

&gt; (5) The regulations must provide for any licence—

&gt; ↳ (a) to have effect as if granted by the missing owner;

&gt; ↳ (b) not to give exclusive rights;

&gt; ↳ (c) not to be granted to a person authorised to grant licences.

&gt; (6) The regulations may apply to a work although it is not known whether
   copyright subsists in it, and references to a missing owner and a right
  or interest of a missing owner are to be read as including references to
a supposed owner and a supposed right or interest.",0,1367516097,null,0,1367516414,0,c9r3p19,t3_1dji22,t1_c9r3p19,t3_1dji22,null,1431347811,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Here's 10th model ink pen from ThinkGeek. It says it has some kind of UV ink that is only visible under UV light. However, I'm pretty sure it also comes with a normal ink cartridge. You should make sure before you buy it.

http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/8cff/?srp=2

Here's just a model of the 11's screwdriver. It's just a prop, a toy, not a pen or a flashlight or anything. It has moving parts just like the one on the show. If you want a screwdriver just for looks and nothing else, I would get this one.

http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/d7d8/?srp=1

Here's the 11th's screwdriver that is an actual screwdriver with interchangeable bits. **I have this**. I'm not too impressed actually, it fails both of its purposes.

As a collector's model, it's not the best quality and seems poorly made. Paint and plastic is easily chipped and damaged. There's a button that makes a tinny and awful imitation of the noise it makes on the show.

And it's not very good as a real screwdriver either - the bits seem to be made of a low quality metal that is easily damaged by normal use, you would break the plastic if you turned it too hard, it's large and unwieldy, and the bits are not magnetized.

It's pretty cool looking - but if you want an authentic looking model then just get a model, if you want a good screwdriver then just get a regular screwdriver.

Most people in England (I seem to remember you're American?) don't get names on their shirts. It's kind of seen as a kids' thing over here. So maybe 40% of people getting names are getting Benteke, but it's definitely not that 40% of all shirts are getting Benteke on the back. Moreover, virtually everyone who buys a shirt would have bought one regardless. The people saying ""I'll get a shirt so I can have Benteke's name on the back"" are a tiny minority.

I've never understood why people are so bothered about shirt sales. You buy one because you love the club, and then maybe you get a name on it. There are a few exceptions - I imagine Dempsey has brought a good number of direct shirt sales with him - but having lots of people wanting your name on their back doesn't really bring any money into the club.

I'm not sure how 'it' doesn't work, it's just an inherent part of the evolution of language. A group has a label, the label becomes a perjorative or picks up negative connotation, the group elects a different label which better reflects themselves than the caricature their previous label has become.

I see no reason why, at least in the public sphere, at least in the professional world that we should have a pop at people trying to re-frame themselves in the face of mistreatment due to the connotations of a label gone out of control.

I agree with this, and no doubt women get a harder time on the internet then men it was the misogynist part that galled me as I think it was unfair to categorise him just for disagreeing. I follow the owner of WoS on twitter and I honestly feel that he would ask the same questions of anyone, it just happened that this time it was a woman(though I agree that it's pretty difficult to prove either way).

I think the difference in this case is that if there was evidence shown that what she's claiming is true then WoS would change its stance while I feel that people who are misogynist wouldn't even in the case of evidence.  

EDIT: I should also say that if she did receive the abuse I hope she has informed the police and they investigate the matter, it just seems strange that abuse is normally quite easy to find online (twitter, facebook etc) and in this case there doesn't appear to be any evidence which is why the claims are a bit suspicious

It suddenly made sense a short while later when I was watching the news, and discovered that the Spastics Society had changed its name to Scope.

""Scopey"" never caught on AFAIK, but it easily could have - it was certainly used as an insult the same day that the name change was announced on the news and before a lot of people even knew about the new name.

Another example from my own experience of how easily a word can become an insult - when I was in primary school (late 70s or possibly very early 80s), ""Joey"" was a common insult for at least a while. I never knew why at the time but apparently it was triggered by a single documentary about a disabled child.

true,tophatstuff,cnty-wales,Swansea,"I looked at the FAQ offered by Ofcom and a law firm relating specifically to telephone recordings.

They suggest it is legal to do make recordings *for personal use*. You cannot share it with a third party without consent. They suggest you can make a case to share with a third party if it's in the ""public interest"" (e.g. whistleblowing) but it's difficult and you should get more advice at that point. In court in civil cases or tribunals it can sometimes be admissible if the information is ""already disclosed"" and ""highly relevant"" but the act of disclosure could potentially be illegal itself. I couldn't find anything about criminal cases except on Yahoo! Answers.

However, I think you're definitely right that there's difference between perceptions of beauty in older men and women. Women are usually considered unattractive past the age of 40 (maybe even younger), while older men manage to retain their sex appeal well into their 50s.

&gt;Yes - if you have your tickets delivered by First Class or Royal Mail Special DeliveryTM Next Day, a receipt will be enclosed with your tickets. If you choose to collect your tickets from a self-service ticket machine, a receipt will be given with the tickets.

Well, I already knew it *looked* like a receipt because they say ""receipt"" on them and what would be the point otherwise?

At any rate, it seems that's moot since you're right in that train companies generally expect you to simply give up and not travel when they fuck up a train - as opposed to using the ticket on a later train and billing them for the inconvenience.

I liked this bit:

&gt;Please note that eligible refunds take up to six weeks to be processed. You will normally be required to pay a MyTrainTicket administration fee of £10 for the refund of part or all of your booking... Please ensure that your tickets are appropriately insured against loss in the post as we can only process refund applications when we receive the tickets.

Anyway, saying that I was a little surprised at the lack of local candidates for my local district election - there was only a Conservative and an Independent. I hovered to the Conservative, and I had to spoil my vote because I cannot honestly distinguish who the best candidate is.

With regards to my local council election I voted Labour, even though our local Conservative is quite popular in our town. Our high street has dead blocks in the middle of it, whilst shops like Sainsburys and poundland have opened and are booming. Admittedly that is a national issue, but what swung my vote was this:

The library has moved from a really good, historic building to a 21st Century specially built arid, dry, conventional pit. My town has generally become one where only the charity shops, hair dressers, charity shops and nail salons thrive. Even, Jade Goody opened a shop here. I thought a new lot need to be in charge, even though that will not happen since our town has the blue-rinse brigade on the reins.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You can't redefine ""freedom"" to mean whatever you feel like on a case by case basis.

Society has already adopted limitations on the freedom of speech, for example Muslims Against Crusades was banned because they were exercising their right to free speech concerning the support of extremism and acts of terrorism. I don't propose that many people have a problem with the banning of groups that support extremism, but why is extremism banned, whereas racism is not? 

&gt;I'm actually really starting to think you might be a fascist now, proscribing organisations just because you don't like what they stand for?

Firstly, I am not a fascist. I do not support the notion that we should use ""political violence, war, and imperialism as a means to achieve national rejuvenation."" I absolutely disagree with almost everything about fascism. A lot of people today automatically assume that those who not agree with an absolute freedom when it comes to speech are auto-fascists. I do not condone the shutting down of speech based on whether the view being expressed agrees with mine or not. 

I do however, support the shutting down of hubs for oppression. An individual has no right to use their freedom of speech to oppress others, either through verbal attack, the preaching and condoning of physical attack, or in the EDL's case, the spread of utter non truths concerning Islam. 

There is a significant difference between the shutting down of freedom of speech, and what I advocate. I have no problem whatsoever with someone disagreeing with me on political grounds, as you are. It's a source of healthy discussion and can, rarely, change my views. People using their speech to oppress others, that I have a problem with.

&gt;As for the elevation, of course you are, or you're elevating someone else.

As it is, there are government officials, namely the Home Secretary, who decide who to prevent entering the country based on their views? 

&gt;No, I wouldn't. I have no issue with the UK communist party, a UK nazi party, the UK whatever party. That's fine. If there are people with beliefs like this let them get together and make themselves known, and then reasonable intelligent people can get a discourse going and dissuade them of their beliefs

Are you somehow implying that communists are not ""reasonable intelligent people?"" I found your accusations of fascism all the more annoying because I'm a Marxist Socialist, but this just seems like it's straight up insulting me. You confuse the difference between a political view and a social view.

&gt;You can't change ideas by force, and it's exactly what you're suggesting we try and do.

I'm not suggesting that we can change ideas with force, just that it would help the problem if there weren't groups out there dedicated to the spread of lies and propaganda whose content is oppressive, and promotes those views which society as a whole has thrown into the bin of history to be silenced.

I live around 10 miles out of Newcastle and this photo was taken at Bellingham, Northumberland. Was probably only 50-60 miles for the round trip. Was perfectly comfortable really. The only complain was when I maybe exceeded the speed limit a little bit to 70mph, at those speeds you reach the rev limiter and get some lovely vibrations to go with it.

The only other complaint I could have was a Peugeot driving 10 inches from my rear wheel who ignored every 'get the **** back' gesture I gave him and then risked doing a double overtake past me and a lorry over a blind summit with a corner just after it. As soon as I saw him go I  slowed right down and gave myself a large gap between me and the lorry. Sure enough, another car comes over the summit and the Peugeot driver slams on his brakes and dives in just behind the lorry, exactly where I would have been had I not dropped right back.

true,Haurian,England,Kent - '10 XJ6 Diversion,"You'll have difficulty using the same bike for riding on your A2 license and taking the category A test. ([numbers below from here](https://www.gov.uk/motorcycle-practical-test/rules-for-mopeds-and-motorcycles-used-in-the-practical-riding-test))

Under the A2 license, you are allowed a maximum engine power output of 35kW (46.6 HP). However, the bike you use for the category A (unrestricted) practical test must produce at least 40kW engine power, in addition to (as you say) being at least 595cc. 

This causes some rather obvious issues. You can of course de-restrict the bike prior to any tests, but that causes more issues than it's worth. Any insurance valid for the restricted bike would be rendered invalid, you'd probably need to prove that the bike was de-restricted, you'd need to get it re-restricted immediately post-test, re-insure again, and be under radio instruction from a licensed trainer from the moment you start riding the bike after de-restriction until you get it restricted again or pass your test.

Long story short, it's much simpler to just hire a bike for your tests. Most bike schools will include bike hire in their advertised prices for A2/A tests.

A side-note on the motorway miles thing. You seem to think that bigger = better. This is only half true. As soon as you have enough power to keep motorway speeds, it doesn't really matter any more. What becomes more important is comfort and fuel economy, the latter being found at smaller displacements. And while weight is beneficial in windy conditions, it doesn't have a *huge* effect - the bike's geometry (WRT the area perpendicular to the wind) has a similar effect.

There's a possibility that some of your credits from ManU may transfer to an American university, which may mean you don't have to take the same classes as incoming Freshmen would. 

Admissions guidelines for international students is likely different for each of the universities you expressed interest in. However, admissions officers at American universities are generally extremely helpful. I would suggest contacting them to set up a time to discuss things over the phone. Make a list of all your questions: **how will my grades transfer?, how do I get you a copy of my transcripts?, can I apply for Financial Aid within the US or do I need to apply through my home country?**, etc. Contact info can be found under the admissions section of any university homepage - for example, here's the email address for international student admissions at Boston University:  intadmis@bu.edu.

I'm sure you would enjoy your university experience here in the States BUT be forewarned that it is increasingly expensive and no longer guarantees you any kind of employment after graduation. An unfortunate truth for American and International Students alike...

There are several ways of going about this- 1) Go to a liberal arts college (smaller, expensive, but typically offer a lot of support to international students) *most students will enter at 18, however* 2) Go to a university that offers a broad program of study, like Western Washington or Northern Arizona (some of the schools you listed may as well, but I don't know specifically, well UC Berkeley probably does).

If you did one of the standard ""I want a BS in Chemistry"" programs, chances are that with your record, you would apply and be accepted into a number of schools, especially state universities in the US (I'm not sure about Canada). They may or may not offer support (funding) to international students, but a wide range of ages of students will attend these programs, so you definitely wouldn't be out of place.

My advice would be to explore your options- sources of funding for UK students to study in the US (both attached to studying at a particular university or college, and others that are just general funding for studying in the US), the international programs offered by the schools you're interested in (go to the admissions website, then international admissions..), and how to apply.  Each school has their own application system, and it will be explained in their international student section on their site. I know that there are loans and funding available, you just have to go out and find them. And recognize that you may have to apply over a year in advance for funding, so start researching asap.

On a complete, or maybe minor, tangent...It's fascinating - being 12 and taking up proper 'surfing' instead of boogie-boards and playing in the waves and then your local beach changes from being a sandy cove where the sea is somewhat in or out to being this fascinatingly complex system of which our little break is a tiny part, and you bobbing about in that water is a mere quark of a part....And the understanding of tides and the underlying breaks, and how the surf and weather combine with the local spot to be like bad conditions or great conditions....

It's fabulous to have a lazy day and see a spring tide and see the tide drop so low the point you never expected to see waves off start breaking.

It's just inherently beautiful, I'm a terrible surfer, but from being 'into it' I feel that I discovered such a rhythm and intimacy between the fabric of the sea, the wind, the sand and the rock, that I am blown into the 'surfer's perspective' 

Sorry if this is just wordy bollocks, but it's just a keyboard assault from someone who grew up in the waves, and will never be too far from the sea.

Hmmm. Not sure I'm with you on that. Millions of people have been successfully diagnosed and treated for depression and diabetes due to medical definitions. Sure there are blurred boundries, but it's not blurred enough to be significant. 

&gt;I'm saying that most of these cases being investigated by the beeb are older men abusing pubescent teenage girls, the kind redditors argue is not actually paedophilia, but ebophebowotsit. And that many men lust after, even if they wouldn't act on it.

I'm not sure if I understand this paragraph correctly, but a man lusting after a pubescent woman is not paedophilia. You can't really get around that definition, no matter how hard you try. The classifications of health professionals who work closely with child abuse victims and paedophiles are in place to help people. If we just dismissed the definition of depression, then it would be a lot harder to treat, would it not?  

&gt;I'm also saying that power differentials are a major part of heterosexual relationships,

I wouldn't say a major part. Not in the western world at least. But yes they do play a role. They're also a major part of homosexual relationships and pretty much all human relationships.  

&gt;and are a large part of why men like younger women in general.

Yeah I agree with this to an extent. But you can't also discount the role the aging process plays in attractiveness. I'd say it's a bit of both.

There is also a perverse intellectual snobbery, of viewing people with a conventional education in science as somehow less able to use imagination or experience free thought. Also if you ask people to name big mistakes in science, they will be able to recall the thalidomide problems or Chernobyl disaster much quicker than asked for a scientific success like sequencing the human genome. 
In short, it is easier for people to get their half-baked ideas out there to a willing audience. 

Another view is that humans have a desire to 'believe' in something, that unites them with other fellow humans.  For the longest time we had religion, the observations of our world came with the premise that god had created it that way.  Then came the enlightenment and the birth of scientific principals, it challenged the then religious thinking and was rejected by the church and it's followers. But humans are fickle, and we learnt to embrace science, and we had something else to believe in, something else to follow. Now, as a society we have got over the 'honeymoon' period of belief in science, and we have born witness to its failings, we need something else to believe in. Hence the recent rise of new 'religions' such as obsessive belief in the supernatural or alien landings as examples,and conspiracy theories are fun, nothing like some intrigue to sex things up!

To accommodate for the crowd, an announcement pops up saying they've added a second train and please can we not squish onto the train thinking it's the last one. Being as high as we were, half the crowd stayed behind in good spirit; time was not an issue. Cheering and drinking the bitter cold away. After about half an hour, and still no train, we're not so cheery. No announcement change though; the train is just late apparently.

Come an hour of apologies over the loud speaker, we get an announcement saying there will be no train after all. However, a replacement bus service will be running! Hurrah!

Needless to say, after half an hour or so when a bus does turn up at the bus stop, it's not going the right way. The crowd of people essentially lynch the poor driver to get him to see if there's a replacement bus service at all, to which he says there is. We let him pass in desperate optimism.

After 2 hours of waiting for various services, it turns out that they cancelled the bus too. Without telling us. Eventually, a crowd of about 250 people were left to find their way across London on a trail of nightbusses, confusing the poor public who didn't understand why their normal route was literally jam packed at 2am.

Renegades have obvious motives for keeping their names, if not precisely secret -- perhaps the Time Lords know their true names, at least in many cases -- then at least ""under the rug"", as it were. But additionally, the renegades are people who have a *reason for rebelling*, so I think it would be quite natural to title oneself in some way in relationship to that reason -- not unlike the names superheroes pick for themselves. And then some of these titles no doubt were nicknames given by others.

The Doctor himself, so far as we can tell, took on the moniker ""The Doctor"" most likely in an organic way (one way to interpret the old series approach to it) or as a statement of his personal mission (one way to interpret the new series approach to it), and the secrecy of his true name possibly became a thing later in his personal history, so now the title has taken on greater significance.",0,1367543524,null,0,1367544336,0,c9rdfw9,t3_1dkwl6,t1_c9rdfw9,t3_1dkwl6,null,1431343075,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The ""out-of-state"" tuition is usually ridiculously high and unfortunately I don't believe you would qualify for federal loans. Not sure if HM Government would help you out there, but even if they did you'd be looking at probably £100k, at least, after living expenses and out of state tuition for 4 years (our system is fucked up, I know). 

You can always look into private scholarships and such but the big ones would be reserved for Americans I would imagine. Really I think your best bet is to figure out which unis offer big scholarships for your field (i.e. Chemistry) and apply for them. Most unis will give out merit scholarships depending on how good your grades are. 

What were your A-levels and GCSE's (feel free to pm them to me)? I would say you're certainly qualified to apply based on the fact that you've completed your A-levels, though I don't know how US unis interpret A-levels as we have admissions tests instead of A-levels.

I'm not convinced Eriksen is a realistic possibility, but he or someone like him really would be an ideal attacking addition. He can play as a CAM or a regular CM, and the important thing that he'd be able to do (in this hypothetical scenario) is that he'd be better at controlling our play in more advanced areas than the players he have now. Suarez is brilliantly creative there but he loses the ball too much and doesn't have the passing ability or patience we sometimes need, ditto Coutinho. Henderson's probably the closest comparison, but he's not as skillful or creative; someone like Eriksen, in theory, allows us to take our midfield passing and control of the ball and move it a good distance further up the pitch, increasing our potential for pressure and our ability to get more players into dangerous positions.

A good example is how real madrid got caught out at dortmund because alonso was marked out of the game and madrid lost the midfield battle, if luiz was given as much time on the ball as the madrid defenders he would have made dortmund pay. 

Luiz should be utilized as a cb because he plays very well there but lack of midfield shape and control means chelsea struggles to contain the ball and move it around the pitch properly.

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"A good defensive coach surely has to be at the top of the list. When we make the field small (high line) and play on the front foot we are incredibly sound (see Newcastle). However, when the defense is to afraid or tactically inept for the high line to prevent space behind the midfield we can be really shit (see Aston Villa). I'm hoping a defensive coach can come in and undo the years of Rafa, Hodgson's, and Kenny's deep line. 

We need probably one more great signing in attack and defense. Who? I'm not quite sure. Some depth is also necessary. Our bench lately shows just how little depth our squad has. I'd love to see a powerful defender and a more physical midfielder.

It's time someone tells Suarez to play more on the wing. You can see during some games he gets his ""I must win this myself"" mentality which doesn't often come off for us. In the west Ham game he lost the battle with Collins every single time but when Sturridge came on he insisted that he should remain in the center. The same happened against Chelsea for most of the game. It's time someone mans up and tells him he can't play central all day, Sturridge appears plenty fine in that position. 


Our opponents to get weaker. We need Spurs to lose Bale and Arsenal to have another shit transfer window. Everton need to lose Fellaini too. 


And finally patience. We more than likely aren't going to get top four next year. Actually I'm going to say it now, we aren't. I'd be happy to be proven wrong but this team is far from the finished article. We need a mentality shift from fans and players alike. We need players to adjust to a system they haven't played before in their Liverpool careers. We have a young manager who, like any great young prospect, will make mistakes and will learn from them. Obviously I'd love top four but if you offered me a one place improvement over this year, more familiarity with tactics, an exciting cup run (not necessarily winning it) and some good signings to build upon,and the continued improvement of Academy and backroom staff, I'd take it right now.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"Okay, I'll suggest a couple things that are urgent and doable.

1. **Two new central defenders** to replace Carra, Coates and Skrtel. And they key thing is, in addition to being comfortable with the ball, *they need to be players who attack the ball, rather than the man*. Skrtel and Coates are too reactive, which is why they aren't playing now. I would have said the same about Carra a few months ago, but he's proven me wrong by being more aggressive. That's the key thing that makes Coates and Skrtel excellent defenders for Rafa/Kenny/Hodgson teams but sorely lacking for Rodgers'. A key part of Rodgers' defensive system is that when the team works the ball up the pitch, the full-backs move up, the DM/CM drops back and the CBs spread out - that leaves a lot of space for both us and our opponents to use back there, which is why we need proactive defenders to close down that space before they can exploit it. Carra, despite his lack of pace, has been able to rely on his reading of the game to partially do that job, but he's also played a bit deeper. Ideally, we need someone mobile who can read the game and naturally attacks the ball before it gets to the striker.

2. **Improved defensive coaching.** We need to stop leaving players unmarked when defending crosses, getting mixed-up at corners, etc. That of course is partially down to the personnel, but the coaching also needs to do a better job of figuring out what's going wrong and fixing it. 

3. **DM cover for Lucas.** I'm a big Joe Allen fan, but he's not a DM. He *can* play that role effectively (as seen in the opening months of the season) but that's because of his proficiency with interceptions and harrying playmakers, if opponents keep the ball out of those areas or attack in greater numbers, he struggles a bit because he's not naturally a defensive shield and doesn't tackle as well as Lucas. We need someone who can understudy Lucas, and occasionally partner him. 

4. **One more way of unpicking defences.** Between our current players, we've got pace, dribbling, movement, through-balls, long shots and workrate. While we could use more of all those things, we're missing patience, width, ariel ability and muscle; Downing's the only player who brings the first two. (Andy Carroll would bring a couple of those, but I'm still not convinced he'll get a chance because he doesn't seem like he can fit into the system as anything but an emergency substitute, and I don't think we *want* an emergency substitute who changes a fundamental element of how we play.) Whether it's a striker, winger, a CAM or some hybrid of those, we could use one more player in attack who fits into the team while adding something we don't have. A lot's said about consistency - and most of it's true - but part of that is having too much overlap in the skills of our attacking players. Part of the skill of teams being able to win games when they're playing poorly is often being able to adapt - if our attackers all play the same way and play well, we'll score ; if they all play the same way but play badly, it's easier for opponents to set up against them. We need to be able to beat teams in more ways. 

Based on the problems we've already fixed and the experience that the squad's gained, I think this would realistically put us on comparable levels to Arsenal/Spurs, and give us a decent chance at CL qualification.",0,1367553181,null,0,false,0,c9rgq0j,t3_1dlh4j,t1_c9rgq0j,t3_1dlh4j,null,1431341529,29,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,29

I know it's silly to blame decisions not going our way and individual player errors, but they've cost us at least 10 points this season. Skrtel against City, Reina against City, Suarez offside at Everton, Enrique at Swansea, and *numerous* defending set piece fuck ups. We're 11 points off third now. Which is a distance to be sure. But think about this, every big club we've played, we've held our own, and sometimes been the better side. And we've pretty much destroyed all the lower teams. The only poor showings have been away to WBA, home to Arsenal, away to Stoke, home to Villa and away to Southampton. The rest have ranged from good to fantastic. None of the other *big* clubs have bossed us around. Make no mistake about it, on our day we're as good as anyone in the league. Our main problem has been consistency. Also look, I can't remember the last time we had a team capable of scoring 4, 5, 6 goals against the opposition. We've done that quite a bit this season. Once we get that first goal we can become ruthless. Home and away. There's definitely something brewing in our team. Top 4 is going to be a challenge but I believe if we're smart over the summer it's definitely achievable. In fact *I'M* going to predict we will get fourth.

Their main justification for not legalizing same-sex marriage is that it would open a legal can of worms and result in challenges at the European Court in Strasbourg; but in the next breath they say they would withdraw the UK from the ECHR and repeal the HRA, in which case *there could be no legal challenge*, so what objection could they have then?

It's just thinly veiled homophobia.

They also claim that they would defend UK farmers and ensure they get their EU farming subsidies, but again - how could they negotiate *anything* from the EU if the UK were no longer part of it?

They're happy to allow people to believe (they *surely* don't believe it themselves?) that *all* 29 million people in Romania and Bulgaria would come *here* to the UK. Our nation is that important, see?
One hundred percent emigration all the way across Europe, they imply. And all of it to the UK; not to Greece or Italy or Spain or Portugal where at least the climate would be agreeable, not to Austria or Germany, not to France where the language is similar to Romanian, but to the United Kingdom.

Has there ever been a single recorded example, in the last ten thousand years of human history, where the entire population of a country (never mind two countries) left their homes en masse?

Even though Nigel Farage has been to Bulgaria on a fact-finding mission and *been told* by Bulgarians that they wouldn't want to leave, that they love their country, that anyway Britain is too cold and grey and wet, still he insists that the great exodus will happen.

The kippers must have lost their grip on reality. It's psychosis. A delusion.

They would cheerfully opt out of the ECHR - the convention we've been part of for about sixty years because Winston Churchill *himself* didn't want to see a repeat of the abuses that occurred in Europe during the thirties and forties  - and they would deny to *everyone* the right not to be killed, not to be tortured, not to be enslaved, rights to a fair trial, free speech, freedom of religion and all the other rights.
All these rights denied to everyone in the UK, just so that they could deport *one man* to a country where he will probably be tortured.

Behind all that chummy, cricket-on-the-village-green Englishness, and the simplistic stands-to-reason logic of the proverbial man-in-the-pub, I suspect there lies an air of nastiness, or disgust with anything *different*, which makes UKIP quite dangerous.

We're never the best judges of our own clarity ;).

&gt; Hence there s no solid boundary for 'disordered'. I'm saying paedophilia is somewhat like this (particularly for older children).

I agree broadly and there definitely needs to be more research into paedophilia - without a doubt. But my problem with your opinion hinges how blurry you think that boundry is. There's also no 'solid boundry' between a child and an adult. But that doesn't stop medical professionals and law makers from creating the boundries in order to better protect children - and rightly so. You also seem to be making a distinction yourself between the targeting of ""older children"" and younger children.

&gt;Also, just so we are absolutely clear: are you saying that an adult man lusting after, say, a 14 year old isn't paedophilia? If so then you will be in disagreement with many of the charges in the BBC scandal.

Now we're getting into legal definitions, rather than medical. An adult man lusting after a 14 yr old is commiting no crime in Germany, where the age of consent is 14, or in Spain, where it's 13, or a number of other countries. Do I personally think he's a paedophile? I would say he better fits the definition of - as you put it - an ephebowotsit. Like I said, making these distinctions is important for medical professionals and law enforcement, because they help protect children. 

Either way, in my personal view, a 14 year old is not an adult and therefore cannot give consent. If that man acted on his desires he would be commiting a serious sexual assault (bloody Germans). Again, if you want my personal view, I think 16 is too young to consent to sex with anyone over the age of roughly 21 - the risk of exploitation is far too high. But my opinions don't make laws!   

&gt;My sister's ex-boyfriend is currently in prison for grooming a 15 year old and a 13 year old online and then sexually assaulting them. He is 29. Do you think it is wrong that he is in prison?

Well, that's awful to hear, and I feel very sorry for your sister (not to mention the girls who were abused).

For the first time since I remember it actually looks like moves we practise on the training ground are translating onto the pitch. There's no reason to think we won't continue to improve this part of our game purely based on young players developing in themselves and as combinations. And we already scored a ton of goals this season ...

I think if we continue with the balanced approach we've had recently where we're creating chances while giving up very few chances against us (no more 4-2-4 formations like at southampton or oldham please) and don't have a tough time with injuries or reffereeing we'll be in the mix with spurs and arsenal next season. Manc clubs and chelsea will be ahead of us.

The biggest hole in our team is pretty obvious, we should be looking to spend most of our transfer funds on at least one top class centre half. Then second priority is an experienced defensive midfielder, both as back up for Lucas, and also potentially to play alongside him in big games (also considering Gerrard's age we can only hope, but not expect, Stevie to start every league game again next season).

A new attacker will only be required if someone leaves. As it is we have four first team attackers for 3 positions - Suarez, Sturridge, Downing, Coutinho. And the back up for them is stronger than the back-up we have elsewhere in the team - Borini, Sterling, Suso. Attack is also the area where most of our young talent is.

One thing I'd like to see from Brendan is a willingness to sub star players when they're having a shocker. Like Rafa subbing Gerrard off in the derby or Torres against Birmgingham.

I did a longer post on this some time ago, but the think tank narrative was selective to the point of being outright deceptive.

They cherry picked a few stats of questionable relevance eg the number of prisons that were doing better than average. It used very badly defined subjective criteria (they failed to clearly define what was good ""resource management and operational effectiveness) in others.


Pointedly they did not mention the total figures for the sector as a whole. Many of the private prisons were doing slightly, but only slightly better than the public sector. None were doing much better. However, several of the private prisons were doing MUCH worse, including the only youth private prison.

Totalled, this meant the average performance of the private prisons was slightly worse than the public sector average. They obfuscated this data, dressing it up to present results quite opposite from those the facts suggested. You can't just disregard outliers in research of this nature, which is exactly what reform did.

If I had more time I would go on at length, but I personally found the presentation of the figures by Reform to be almost unprofessional for social scientists.

Racists have always voted, and at what point does a protest stop being a protest and start being a genuine ideological difference?

The thing I take from this is that the main parties in this country are consistently ignoring the concerns of the electorate and doing whatever the hell they feel like.  UKIP are doing a fantastic job of providing a bandwagon for these disenfranchised people to jump on.  Increasingly people seem to be saying ""bugger this"" and either not voting at all or voting for a party like UKIP.

As long as it stays this way, the other parties can't be trusted, and the other parties ignore a large part of the electorate, UKIP will keep making gains.

I don't want to see UKIP winning anything, but to blame voters for not electing parties with policies the voters don't like is crazy.",0,1367574252,null,0,false,0,c9rl0dc,t3_1dl7yx,t1_c9rl0dc,t1_c9re5ep,null,1431339437,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;Of course we need some


I'm confused.

&gt;we can't have everyone coming over here

We don't. There are stringent controls on non-EU immigration. And EU immigration is part of a free trade deal. If we left the EU and negotiated our own free trade deals, these deals would also include the free movement of labour, again providing us with the same issue. If you don't like immigration, you basically can't have free trade with foreign nations. I'm not willing to make that sacrifice.

There are controls on immigration. And in the instances where there are not, it's for a good reason. The issue of immigration is blown way out of proportion by the tabloid media, who prey on people's fears of out-groups, in order to sell newspapers and generate traffic by whipping up outrage. Unfortunately this leads to a lot of people becoming politically charged in a radical direction based on a distortion of reality.

OMG. That is not something that is just an ""incidentally"" but is the most important part of your post. 

You work for the umbrella company, not the agency. The agency are a customer of your umbrella company. 

Because of how an umbrella company works you are effectively self employed with all the rights of a self employed person which amount to none, nada, zero. Any claims you make you make against yourself so you claim against yourself for sick pay, employment rights etc...

You therefore cannot opt out or withdraw from this opt out because it does not apply to you. It applies to people who are paid by the agency on PAYE but not those signed up to an umbrella company.

Agencies have been using umbrella companies for some time and even moreso now to get around the recently introduced Agency Workers Regulations. 

Now this will piss you off because the AWR means that an agency worker who has been at a placement for 12 weeks is automatically entitled to the same pay, perks and conditions as that company's permanent employees. There is a thing called the Swedish Derogation which they can use but they then have to pay you when there's no work. As you can understand, the agencies want as many people signed up through umbrella companies as possible to get around the AWR regulations.

I don't necessarily disagree with your point... but I would say it actually can be extended to many people in the UK, not just the Scots. I would also make the case that devolution would solve virtually every argument put down on the table, with just a few single-issue problems like Trident that persist - and aren't that much of a day-to-day issue in the long run (but are useful politically because they evoke passionate feelings on both sides).

I would also make the counter argument that independence isn't going to change the fact Scotland has a huge dominant neighbour to the south. I think, counter-intuitively, you might actually find Scotland has less say over many of its affairs (particularly economic) under independence. Even the fabled Trident removal might actually take decades simply for technical reasons - not to mention the prohibitive cost will probably force the entire UK to disarm. The US/NATO are not going to encoruage that and will no doubt pile pressure on an independent Scotland to be as 'forthcoming' in negotiating the removal of trident as possible.

At the centre of my point is this -  The UK has a vast diplomatic corps thats been slowly setup and consolidated over 1000 years of sucess, failure, empire and war. To say it is well established is an understatement... It is possibly one of the most entrenched and well positioned diplomatic organisations in the world. At some point, post-independence 5 million Scots will need to sit down at a negotiating table, with a fledgling diplomatic organisation and discuss with 55 million peeved 'rUK' folk how independence will be achieved. If the Scots think they are going to tell 55 million people what to do, they are radically mistaken. The UK will inevitably use just about every diplomatic, political and economic machination it possess to limit the damage to itself, economically and politically. As a result, I suspect the best case scenario under independence is probably an economy roughly along the lines of what Scotland currently has and maybe one or two muted achievements- like a commitment to remove trident within the next 30-40 years and some sliding formula for oil that will gradually taken hold in about 20 years, by which point who knows what the state of either oil prices or the north sea will be... also a time when British shale gas fields are potentially coming on tap.

It's easy to use the positive imagery associated with independence to disguise it as a panacea for all Scotlands percieved problems. But as I said to the OP above - I'd personally push for maximum devolution, if only as a stepping stone in the long run. When put side by side, I can think of no benefits to choosing independence over maximum-devolution, followed by the possibility of independence in the future.",0,1367575300,null,0,false,0,c9rl4j5,t3_1cz0jq,t1_c9rl4j5,t1_c9raku4,null,1431339382,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Surely a libertarian gov't would legislate on the justice system with an evidence based approach, instead of via a very policy specific ideology such as this.

I fail to see how the military spending increase is anything other than ideology influenced specific policy once again.

True, but this isn't something which only affects the person (and their children) making that decision; someone who chooses not to immunize is making a decision which can negatively affect the community.

&gt; I can choose to not use a car

But people who are medically unable to have immunization themselves cannot choose not to be around people who have chosen not to for no good reason, and so are exposed to greater than necessary risk because of it. 

As a child you cannot choose whether or not to use a car, and if your parent puts you in a car without suitable seat belt, or doesn't put it on you, as a child you have no choice on that. In such a situation the parent putting their child at unnecessary risk is subject to the laws regarding seat belt use

* Donna Noble - The only 2 good episodes of the Donna Noble series were ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"" unless you include the return of Rose (which is good for an entirely different reason)

* Adipose (See Donna Noble)

* The ""Wasp Vicar"" episode (See Donna Noble)  
* The Doppelgangers in season 6

Basic training is hard for a lot of people and a lot of people get homesick especially as when I was in you couldn't go home at the weekend for the first 4 weeks. During basic training you're effectively 24/7 working. You'll end up finishing around 10pm or so when you've done your personal stuff such as cleaning boots, uniform, preparation etc then up around 4am to start cleaning your room and block for the 6am inspection so end up with around 5 to 6hrs sleep a day - you will be tired. You will have field exercises where you're awake virtually two days in a row other than the odd hour sleep you can get. 

You are expected to do everything yourself so you need to learn how to make a bed, use a washing machine to wash clothes and use an iron and ironing board. No mummy to do it for you.

One word of advice: Upper body strength. Most people concentrate on running before they go to basic and ignore their upper body strength. You'll need it.

If you survive basic then it is on to trade training which is infinitely easier. You'll usually find that is an 8hr working day - 8.30am to 4.30pm with morning break, lunch, afternoon break other than when you're on exercise where it is back to 24hrs a day. You'll pull guard duty for weekends/nights on a rota basis. That pretty much continues after you've finished trade training and are at your unit.

Royal Navy is different if you're on a ship as you work on a rota system on a 7 day working week whilst at sea but when you're on shore you get block leave of a few weeks to compensate.

Pick up 1-2 more full backs, because let's face it, if Enrique or Johnson gets injured then we are pretty much screwed.

Midfield is pretty stacked, so we can leave that alone. Possibly picking up a veteran midfielder(Xabi Alonso anyone?) just to strengthen that area.

In the 17th century when they used to burn women accused of witchcraft, they'd also burn homosexuals. However, while they burned women at the stake, they felt homosexuals were beneath that, so instead would just throw them among burning piles of wood. A collection of wood being called a faggot.

I forgot that one. Don't worry - other than ""scopey"" you inherited all this from my decade-older generation, and we inherited most of it from older generations. Kids need a lot of insults to get by.

I just looked up ""[div](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=div)"" on the urban dictionary. Lot's of options for the origin. I half-believe the first definition (prison slang). I could maybe believe it's a corruption of ""Deva"", the name of a mental hospital (no. 10), as well. But I don't believe that it's a contraction of ""individual needs child"" (no. 8) because I'm sure ""div"" is much older than that euphemism for disability (inherited from *at least* my parents generation - they're in their 60s now). But I can't help thinking that most of the definitions were written by a bunch of divvies as usual.

I was a bit of a snob in my post and badmouthed Arbury without having ever lived there myself, which is unfair. It does have a bad reputation, but I'm not sure of the level of 'twatishness' there, or how bad it runs. There was a stabbing there a few months ago, in which some lad was killed, and it has drug troubles etc. But saying that, I lived in Soham for six years, and moved there just after the whole Holly/Jessica thing.

Gay people took the word gay and used it to describe each other because they weren't allowed to be open about their sexuality in public.

Gay people for decades or centuries weren't allowed to hold hands with their lovers in public, or enjoy any of the rights you have always enjoyed so freely.

They were [imprisoned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde) and [castrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) for their sexuality - that's two famous examples amongst hundreds who were persecuted, many of whom are still alive today.

And you, a straight person, want to define and redefine the words they use?

Gay people used the word gay because they weren't allowed to be open about their sexuality in public, and it only became an insult as gay people came out the closet and started demanding rights.

Just to be clear here, we're talking about the rights that you have always enjoyed by default, and that you get to enjoy fully because you're straight, and which LGBTQ people are now, decades later, are *nearly* wholly allowed. 

And you want to pretend like you don't know what gay means, and pretend that ""faggot"" doesn't have any historical baggage? What a shit you are. If you don't have any respect for anyone else, you should have some respect for those who marched and got beaten up by police and went to prison so that the current generation of LGBTQ people can enjoy the rights you so casually take for granted.

When the cross comes in it's either 1. Terrible 2. Most the players are just standing outside the box 3. Max two players go for it but with bad timing. Sometimes I miss a strong striker thats inside the box giving the CBs a hard time. I think that would help point 4. I'm impressed with how United attack and the pressure they have when they score the late goals. They have 3-4 in the box on different runs and 2-3 in the space around the box to maintain the pressure, pick up loose ball and take the rebounds. I think we could win more of the games we struggle if we managed to work on that. Dont know if it's possible but I'm thinking Benteke or Jackson Martinez. A player that's best with his feet but also powerful and scores the tap-ins. And creates space for himself with his movement inside the box.

I think we deserved alot better in many games this season and could with a better result in those games be round the top 4 at this moment. In the games we struggle, I think someone in the box for the wingers and FBs to target would have been a real game changer. Maybe a new RW or a CAM that can help us keep the pressure up. Someone who dictates the play in the final third like Mata. Eriksen maybe.

Haven't seen Spearing this year but he could be a cheap solution to the Lucas cover? Or maybe Xabi or Diame?
I'm also curious what roles Kelly and Wisdom will play next season.

Edit: I didn't see it was you from the other thread so sorry if I'm repeating something:P Would probably have wrote it differently if I knew. But the main point is the thing you said about adapting.

When you introduce a character for a one-off, you need to make them much larger than life and exaggerate all their characteristics in order to have an immediate impact on the audience.  You can't do the usual character development and story arc because there isn't time, so they have to arrive fully formed and somewhat over the top.

If you do that with a regular character, you end up with someone who doesn't feel realistic and can be almost a caricature.

Now I get you're probably a bit angry right about now and, as you've already said so, you will have no respect for me right about now. But that's ok, hopefully though you'll read the rest of this post and try to keep an open mind.

The word faggot no longer has the meaning you still hold it to have for many many people. It has nothing to do with being gay but everything to do with being a faggot. Gay people can be faggots, straight people can be faggots, men can be faggots and women can be faggots. To use a different word which perhaps is close to what faggot is would be to call you a pussy. (I wonder if you have the same dislike of that word by the way and if not why not, but I digress). 

Being a faggot is being a faggot, it is living your life in a world of prolonged victimhood, it is getting all pissy over stupid little stuff, it is getting offended and then thinking because you're offended that other people have to change their ways. 

It of course can still be used by idiots as a gay slur but the reason they can still use it that way is because people like you keep it as a gay slur by trying to ban it or stop people using it.

It continues to be as such because homophobes continue to use it as such, not because I make an observation on its use.

I'd probably never call anyone *that* word. Not people who 'deserve it' as I'm not a fan of getting stabbed. 

And not people who don't, because I'm not a cunt. 

I went out with a black girl, a then-mate got drunk and stupid and the night ended for him with a broken nose, my then-gf in tears and me with sore knuckles.

I know the word invokes a powerful response in some people and rightly so, but I'm not going to shy away from the fact that it still applies to people. 

I know a girl who moved to California and is scared to go into ""black areas"" shes a really fit slim white girl, her friends have been attacked in those areas, should people be afraid of ""black areas"" ?

No, white people are victimised just as bad, in some areas and it is just as wrong. 

I don't know where this rant is going but tldr:

I'm a cunt, I'm sorry. I feel awful that your mrs experienced that level of wilful ignorance and intolerance.

I've not said anything about, not a single thing even remotely close to, a land without any laws, prisons or punishment. That's just silly. A libertarian gov't should be set on reducing crime. Not appearing to be tough on crime.

&gt;Libertarians would believe that strong leadership is fine, and that military defence of the country and the borders are one of the few legitimate purposes of government.

Depending on the branch of libertarianism, but yes, fair enough. However, we are fully capable of that atm. Any push for further spending seems too influenced by ideology based on personal preferences, and thus a move of big gov't interference with strong hints of militarism and authoritarianism. Not to mention this would distort various markets by an influx of gov't spending, again, hardly libertarian. And finally diverting funds from other services towards this military fetish clearly will influence every day life.


If that is the view of UKIP on free trade then I can't fault that. Unfortunately they seem to appeal to a very protectionist ideology at times, and it does appear that they are more interested in limiting immigration than they are with simply gaining control of our trade agreements. Any free trade agreements agreed would include free movement of labour. It's either one of the other. You want free trade, or you want to limit immigration. Judging by their supporters, as opposed to their ambiguous policies, it seems they are more concerned with limiting immigration.

Why not vote for them if you want electoral change? I'm all for that but voting for a party that bases it's EU policy on demonstrably inflated statistics which are false at times, that bases it's climate change policies on a non scientist who thinks AIDS sufferers should be quarantined for life and whose immigration statistics are again rarely honestly used.  

You should never ever ever ever vote for a party that has extreme views that you don't agree with because your angry with the system. That's exactly how Golden Dawn has got success in Greece and it's the same with Jobbik in Hungary. Both countries are now seizing with violence, nationalistic racism and anti-semitism. I bet there were thousands of people who voted for one of those two parties because they didn't like the way the main parties dealt with the credit crunch but thought they were just registering a protest vote. Its not a god damn protest vote if they win and then implement neo-nazi policies; you, the unwitting protest voter, have just helped and extreme party into a position where they can hurt people. 

Now, UKIP is on a lower tier but the principle is the same. If you really think your ability to work and live in the EU is not worth some European migration ([of course UKIP ignored a fall in immigration between 2010 and 2012](http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2013/03/how-ukip-surge-came-despite-referendum-pledge-and-immigration-fall/) and then hyped up [Romanian &amp; Bulgarian immigration when, of course, barely any of them want to come to the UK] (http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/04/how-fears-over-romanian-and-bulgarian-immigration-have-been-exaggerated)) then vote for them.
