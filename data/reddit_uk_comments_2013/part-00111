true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"This is a common misconception people have about Sharia, that it's a list of codified laws, prohibitions and punishments whereas in reality it's not. The dress code law you're talking about is something which can be derived from Sharia but it isn't a necessary feature of Sharia. Let's use the US Constitution as an example (since the UK doesn't have one), the Second Amendment of the US Constitution has been interpreted to mean different things by the Supreme Court in different contexts and cases. Sometimes it rules that the Second Amendment only applies to ""well regulated militias"" rather than all citizens in other cases it rules individuals do have the right to bear arms in the case of ""self defense"" and in other cases it rules the Constitution does not provide the right to bear arms at all. 

The way Sharia works would be very similar, and it does work like this in practise. A court in Malaysia and a Taliban commander can both use the same element of Sharia and come up with a different ruling or codified law. In the case of dress code laws, the Qur'an does mention the *awrah* (roughly translated as beauty) of the male is from the navel to the knees and for women it is the entire body except face and hands and thus should be covered and one's gaze should be averted from such areas. There are interpretations using hadith which can make it more/less strict (this is why some women wear burqas and some men don't wear T-shirts) but there is no codified law as to how to the state should respond to someone who violates this principle. This is what the role of courts are, to come up with rulings based on such principles outlined in scripture. A court run by the Taliban will most likely say burqas are compulsory for all adult women and those not wearing should be whipped by religious police whereas in Malaysia a court may rule against advertising which shows men/women with their *awrahs* uncovered but not enforce a punishment for individuals who wear revealing clothing. Instead, they may refer to the section of the scripture which suggests to individuals to lower their gaze when confronted with a stranger's *awrah* rather than have the police enforce this.",0,1370297813,null,0,false,0,cabjgic,t3_1fiijy,t1_cabjgic,t1_cabiul2,null,1430937195,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Tilda Swinton, Helen Mirren both come to mind. Although both might be out of the BBC's price range, it proves that women can be just as charismatic.

I think Doctor Who fans above all else should know not to fear change. Doctors change all the time, just embrace the excitement. They're all different and all of them have different personalities and quirks.

All being black is, is just skin pigment. A woman is just different sex organs. It doesn't change anything really, so why does it matter.

Emenalo is the one deciding on the transfer so of course its his blame (explain the Marko Marin transfer, at that time no one thought Di Matteo would get the job, so how he deserves blame for not bringing in a striker is beyond me). Also its slightly Roman's fault because he didn't want Torres to feel threatened by bringing in another striker. Remember Torres going in an telling Roman he wanted to be the main target man very soon after the one of the greatest night's in Chelsea's history?

Channel crossing: You have 3 basic options - Channel Tunnel, Short Sea Ferry or North Sea Ferry.  
Tunnel is ~35 minutes crossing plus checkin stuff, but has somewhat limited facilities - toilets only on the train, and what is basically a motorway service station while waiting to board.  
Short Sea - This is Dover to Calais/Dunkerque. Price is on par with the Chunnel, but takes considerably longer, at 75-120 minutes crossing depending on company and route. Facilities are better, all ships have a bar/coffee lounge and self service restaurant, most P&amp;O/MyFerryLink vessels have a waiter-service restaurant should you desire.  
North Sea - These go from the UK East Coast (anywhere from Newcastle to Harwich off the top of my head) to the European North Sea coast (Mostly Holland, but some go to Denmark and Belgium). Most are overnight, although the Harwich-Hook of Holland route operates twice daily. Faclities are suitably approaching cruise standards, and considerably more expensive. I would only consider these if they offer a significant shortcut. On the same note is the Western Channel services to Normandy/Brittany et al, but this is somewhat out of your way unless you're in the West Country.  
Personally, I prefer the Dover/Calais ferries. While taking a bit longer, you have a decent amount of time to eat a meal, reducing the need to take a break before/after depending on your proposed timings.

GB sticker - If your plate displays the Euro symbol and GB national identifier, then you don't need one. In any other case, you'd need one.

Comic fantasy, I guess, although some friends of mine who don't usually like that sort of thing still enjoyed them.

I also highly rate Douglas Adam's Dirk Gently series, which is often overlooked in favour of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

If you prefer something a bit more serious, I like Liz Jensen for character driven tales with minor sci-fi/fantasy elements; try *The Ninth Life of Louis Drax* or *War Crimes for the Home* first.

Jules Verne is one of my favourite sci-fi authors. Not so much what a modern sci-fi audience might expect, he was writing during the birth of the genre after all, but very enjoyable.

Again with the 'we' - where are you going to these hivemind seminars to know what we think? I don't think that nationally there is any such consensus.

However, the people that do want it legalised, I don't think they want or expect that the use of it would necessarily be radically increased, they don't want people who use it ending up in the criminal justice system for what is largely a victimless crime. I don't know why any 'new hell' would be unleashed - if it's having deleterious health effects, then that's happening anyway now.

I immediately replied ""well what happened to you, did somebody spill a tin of brown paint on you?"".

He immediately shouted THAT'S RACIST, and I was promptly told off.

To this day I don't understand how repeating the same insult back to him that he used against me is racist when I say it, but not when he does. My mind boggles.

My point is this: I wasn't and am not racist.

Surely we should continue this idea of not wasting food by adding two dates food. One as a legal use-by and another as an estimated use-by.

The Corsair certainly makes it canon that Time Lords *can* change gender, but it would make sense if they say that it's an elective decision they can make while regenerating, not something that usually happens accidentally. Would explain why it's rare.

The problem is that it's going to be an endless rant about real-world gender politics. That may be an important concern, but letting it overshadow the story is just going to be bad for the show, and unlikely to help any real world problems.

They should have done it half a dozen regenerations back. Then it would have been ""cool, gender changes as well"". At this point, though, the arguments seem to be entirely driven by ""equality means we have to have a female Doctor"".

What would be perfectly acceptable is more strong female characters not defined by their romantic interests and/or servitude to the Doctor. Rose wanted the Doctor, and kinda got him, Martha wanted the Doctor and left because she couldn't have him, Amy at least remembered her own fiance - and spent the rest of the series defined by that relationship, and Rory was literally nothing more than the puppy dog who followed her around, so at least they're equal-opportunity with their pathetic characters - after trying to molest the Doctor, and Clara was ""born to save the Doctor"". Which, I suppose, at least wasn't her trying to get into his pants. Hell, even River couldn't be a strong woman in her own right, she had to be his wife.

I want Donna back. She was cool.

* Anything by Patrick Gale, especially Notes From An Exhibition and A Perfectly Good Man. He is the master of family drama. Some of the more thought provoking books I have read, and manages it in a way that doesn't force it down your throat.

* The Martin Beck series by Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. The series follows the life of Beck who is a murder detective on the Sweedish Police Force. Despite being 40 years old they have barely dated, and are far beyond simple crime stories.

And after half-time we brought on Oscar, Ramires and Hazard where United's subs were Macheda and 2 reserve players. And even then it took a 90th minute penalty to keep us in the game. I mean it's easy to look at the score line and be happy, but I was anything but happy afterwards, I mean yes, relieved, but not happy.

RDM is a fucking legend, as a player, and because of the CL, as a manager, too, no one can take that away from him. But the playing style of such a creative bunch was not just what I expected. Maybe that's just me. Maybe I'm basing the whole analysis on a few scattered games. But still. I found the level of intensity in the 2-2 draw much more satisfying, and that is what is to be expected of Chelsea. And you must realize, the kind of fixture congestion and fatigue levels Rafa had to deal with, considering all that, Chelsea were unbeaten in last 8 premier league games, with the best record in all of the league. Yes we lost unnecessary games, but in major tournaments we excelled, and when it mattered, the season was salvaged, with limited resources[striking] and by a man hated by 90% of this club's fanbase.  

IMHO, we ended up far better than where RDM left in Novemeber. Again, yes, my opinion, and well now that Jose is back, all is water under the bridge! The next season is going to be a Classic. All top 3 clubs getting new managers, and we probably got the best deal, ONE OF US!

What is key is that FSG have spent big on the Red Sox, having #2 payroll team to the Yankees for about their whole ownership. Even so, they are leading the field in terms of utilizing advanced metrics (Moneyball). While they haven't been perfect (last year's utterly catastrophic and historic collapse as proof), it has worked pretty well. (They rebounded from last year by shipping off their overpaid lazy stars and bringing in new, more dedicated players on the cheap, and now are leading the division).

If anything can be learned from what they've done with the Sox as well as their evident new strategy, its that they are willing to do what it takes to win. While they aren't going to go Monaco on LFC, they will spend a significant amount for the player they deem right.

Right now as I'm typing, there *are* actresses and non-white actors who are perfectly suitable and up to the job. There are white males suitable for the job. There are black males suitable for the job. There are white and black females suitable for the job. And I'm sure there are other PoCs ready for the job.

Matt Smith was a relative nobody and he did fantastic. There is lots of hidden talent out there. There's no worry about finding someone of the right gender/race to do the job justice. It's really just a matter of which gender/race you're going to choose.

Basically: If a woman/non-white person gets hired, it won't be because they're a woman/non-white person. It'll be because they're up for the job.

Heck, he even takes a cup of tea and a Jammie Dodger over pretty much /anything/, let alone his predilection for jelly babies.

I still think your expectations of the character, and who the character actually are, are the thing in conflict here. Take the Ninth Doctor for the sort of character he is, not by what you think he should be — and certainly don’t rule out how British the Doctor is.

In that sense, I don’t think you’re measuring the Ninth Doctor to his own standards. Maybe you’re measuring them to your own?

&gt;in the UK it's pretty much exclusively flat track

Same in the USA. Here's the main web site for flat track, [WFTDA](http://www.wftda.com/). The ""featured"" league this month is the first ever in Belgium.

Here in Portland OR we are lucky to have (&gt;&gt;have raised the money for) our own skating-friendly floor, which is in pieces that fit together and normally live in our usual space with a tight schedule of team practices, etc. Four times a year we have multiple bouts in a small arena nearby and having to load the pieces of floor into a truck and unload them at the arena (and get it all home afterward) is a big job. The team members do it themselves, taking turns, with beer provided afterwards. Many leagues skate on gymnasium floors (wherever basketball and (Aus) netball are played will fit a track) and others on cement. 

A subtle skater issue is that *there are different wheels* for best performance on each surface. This has given rise to lots of small businesses making and fitting derby gear ... basically, a new industry / market.

Also the starter derby clinics focus on stuff like: when you fall, fall onto your knee pads, or if all the way down, ""fall small"" and curl up fast, so the other skaters can jump over you ... and also, of course, practice jumping other fallen skaters. 

Almost everyone involved is a volunteer and there are a lot of fun jobs for non skating volunteers - the officials in particular have a blast.

That coupled with his calm/relaxed attitude, 'I am one of you', we know how important family is to him etc. 

So I am wondering if he is going to try with a different, family centric group psychology. Before I think it was more a brotherhood of soldiers style, but I think it would suit him, the club, and the project - particularly with the spread of experience we have. Perhaps it would be better to call it a more evolved version of the previous style. I also don't think it would necessarily preclude the warrior mentality he goes for, people will fight to the death for their families.

He can sometimes be a little too careless with the ball and after a few assists to suarez he wastes way too many passes with long balls trying to find him so they can have a repeat of the goal against newcastle.  he is pretty good overall, but a fullback is still a defender, and i think people suggesting he be replaced are doing so because he can put in poor defensive performances at times. one of the better things about him that you mentioned though is that he does nut succumb to injury often.

danny rose makes sense because hes young and improving, however GJ, as up and down as he is, was better this season than the last (though again, his second half was hit or miss) and has filled in solidly at LB, not to mention the return of martin kelly plus andre wisdom means we have our RB position sorted if GJ ever needs to fill in at LB.

tl;dr   he is a pretty good LB, but there are better LBs out there and liverpool can certainly improve in that area, though the squad must be improved in other places first, as i dont see this as a priority in any way.

Compare Rafa to Mourinho. Brilliant tacticians, both, but will a player run through a brick wall for Rafa like they would for Mou? 

&gt;I'm also really glad we got rid of rafa as it turned out so well and never want him back. 

The issue was more complicated than that and we all know it. We were in 7th place when Rafa left. Who is to say whether we would have bounced back or continued downhill if he had stayed?

Whenever romantic relationships are currently thrown into Who, it's to define the companion, not the Doctor. The Doctor doesn't need it. And yet I feel as though a female Doctor would 'need' it.

Maybe it's because society is more willing to accept an oddball, generally asexual man than a woman. Non-sexualized women are 'weird'. It's bad, but that's where it is, and I wouldn't like Doctor Who to be thrown under a bus to attempt to make a dent in this massive problem, to no avail.

Also...creating a female Doctor raises questions about the Doctor's 'orientation'. Is he omnisexual, like Jack, but it's just coincidence we've only seen him falling in love with and marrying women? Is he completely straight, so a female Doctor would still be attracted to women? Is he just attracted to whatever his current 'body' is attracted to....well that would seem a little shallow.

If we use the television series as ""fact"" or perhaps more accurately ""canon"" to this fictitious Whoniverse, there have been multiple times when the power source has been mentioned, and in the most recent series they literally showed it to us. The TARDIS is in fact powered by a star which was 'captured' and placed into the TARDIS at the point in its existence when it was about to collapse into itself as a black hole. The star is kept in a temporal loop so that it's always emanating its maximum potential energy output. 

If you assume it's run on imagination when the show itself explains it's run on stellar energy, that premise makes the rest of your theory unstable. It's poetic, but it doesn't get to the point. The TARDIS is not run by The Doctor's sheer force of will, that's more like how Hal Jordan's Green Lantern ring might work, but not The TARDIS. The TARDIS is more than a mere device. It's a separate entity. Think of it more like a cat or a horse. It does sort of have its own will, which is occasionally at odds with the Doctor's intentions or designs. 

However, as River Song has pointed out on multiple occasions, sometimes the reasons why the TARDIS appears to be unruly or cantankerous is because The Doctor simply has never bothered to learn how to properly ride her. For example, he neglects to remove the ""parking breaks"" which is why it sometimes makes that funny noise as it dematerializes. Little things like that.

No. It doesn't have an all encompassing canon where everything counts and it all happened. If everything was canon, we'd have to factor in all the novels, audios, spinoffs, and comics any time we went to discuss anything. That would be completely ludicrous. 

No canon means **no** canon. Technically, nothing counts unless it's explicitly stated that it does on an story-by-story basis. Technically there is no harm in us assuming for the sake of argument that The Doctor once traveled around Marinus collecting five keys, but as far as Moffat is concerned, Eleven could've landed on Marinus any time during the last three seasons and said ""huh, I've never been here before"".

&gt;There was never a direct reboot in throwing out everything that's happened before and starting over from scratch.

The first episode took me a few goes to get through, and it took me a couple more episodes to get hooked. I don't want to complain too much here, so I will just leave it at that.

I feel like you REALLY missed something though.

I have liked the new doctors 100%, through and through. When Eccleston left I just felt like it was WAY too soon. When Tennant left it felt really real. I loved it, it was absolutely amazing to get to watch this person grow as The Doctor and get his dessert at the end. It was really awesome. I'm not some kind of die hard fiend for 10 though, and I think that might be because of what I believe you missed...

11's beginning. Right after watching 10's end it is absolutely amazing to watch. I think 10's beginning pales in comparison. He leaves everything 10 did behind, he really really starts new, unlike 10 v 9. He has this whimsy about him in the beginning. 

(I believe he is rubber banding back from the time war, each incarnation of the doctor becoming more playful, more longing for adventure. 11's story kind of f'ed with my theory, he ""goes to war."" all too often, but all in all, I think it at least *started* that way.)

I think anyone starting on 11 does themselves a real disservice. Watching it through another time is nice, but it's just not the same I don't think. 

I don't like or want to dump on 10 fans, though I think they are a lot like Final Fantasy 7 fans, latching onto the doctor they ""started."" with, or playing into peoples depiction of him being the best doctor already. I also think people watch 9, don't get enough, and 10 really gets a full run and people latch onto that, and not the character itself. That's fine though, everyone gets to like what they way. But 11 just gets bad wrap for no reason I think. I think his start is absolutely amazing and is exacerbated by 10s ending. 

If I REALLY had to choose a favorite, 11 would probably be it. But I just don't like to think about it in that way. I like all of the new age doctors and I just CANNOT wait for the 50th. If only Eccleston was in it. the only thing I dislike, is also something I like so much about 11. There is a complete lack of characters from his past. I think we are going to get the same exact thing with the next doctor unless Clara ends up staying around.

Also, calling the ""sidekicks"" pathetic is really insulting. The article is also misleading by saying that River's lives were stolen from her by the Doctor. She made the choice and people sacrifice themselves for the Doctor all the time.

This Moffat bashing is not the reason we need a female Doctor. Doctor Who is not sexist. Doctor Who has many many wonderful strong female characters. The reason we should have a female Doctor is for many reasons: it would explore interesting new territory and develop the character. It would explore sexuality and gender. It would be a great role model for young women. It would be a real statement about promoting representation of strong female leads in popular media.

The poster who mentioned about previous generations pavement stomping and raging on the streets until the government were fucking terrified, that can and will happen again if we're pushed far enough. I can pretty much guarantee that! Not saying that's a good or bad thing either but it does give me hope in a strange way - we are certainly NOT a pacified or brainwashed population, nor have we ever been.

I don't know, I think we have a generation or two who have been filled with TV/Newspapers and have never appreciated the Internet. I'd say they're quite brainwashed. The generation of people who refuse to research into a certain court case for example and just knee-jerk reaction. Always wanting the Government to add legislation.

I think in the country we have a strange relationship with the Internet, the internet is the greatest tool we've ever invented and we have a large number of people with access, but not many people understand/use it to it's fullest.

true,Juular-of-the-blog,null,null,"I'm going to address a few arguments. 

People keep saying you can't compare the fact that iconic characters like Tony stark, Batman, Superman, etc. to the Doctor in regards to the gender swap issue, because those characters don't regenerate, but that's not the key to that argument. They don't turn into other genders, not because they can't regenerate, the writers could easily write a convenient plot device into those stories to have the genders changed, just like Doctor Who. But they don't do that because these are iconic and storied characters that, in key ways, should stay the same. The gender and race of those characters, I think, are one of those key components. It's not that I think White people or men are the only people who can be good in those roles, it's simply because that is what the character IS. And why is that wrong? Why can't a character be a static gender or race, and have people suppor that, without being called racist or insensitive to women and other people? It's ridiculous. I'm sure that the writers could come up with a great ways to integrate a different gender Doctor, but ... why should that? This isn't a huge social rights issue, it's a character in a show that has always been a certain way, and there's no good reason to change that.

I  know people want a female Doctor because it would show that even women can be strong and confident and blah blah blah, but Doctor Who, as a series, already shows off tons of strong willed, and intelligent, and interesting female characters through out every who media. And not only that, but there are also tons of characters that defy gender roles and sex stereotypes. Jack harkness, Madam Vastra, Jenny, River Song, Amy, Rory, Rose, Alonso, and tons more defy gender roles in some way during their time on the show, and the women in Who, while yes are always pretty, are also always super strong willed and fun to be around. They are intelligent and witty, and just downright badass. I don't see representation of sex orientation or gender to be an issue in Who. Yes the women in Who are often dependant on the Doctor, BUT SO ARE THE MEN. It's not because women or men are lesser than each other, it's just that the Doctor is... very special. He has that effect on people.

In short, I dont see a logical reason to change the sex of the Doctor. It seems gimmicky, and it would do more harm than good. ",0,1370322446,null,0,false,0,cabrz89,t3_1fl99k,t1_cabrz89,t3_1fl99k,null,1430933108,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"No they're not laws, they're *principles*. In the same way freedom of speech isn't a law it is a principle. So in your example, the dress code law has been introduced to enforce the principle of modesty which is derived from Sharia, if we were to assume every Muslim country had Sharia as its law, some would enforce a dress code law but most wouldn't. Even the ones that do would most likely relax it or change it over time (as we've seen in Saudi Arabia).

I don't support Sharia being used by the government in the UK towards the general population for several reasons: [1] Sharia only applies towards Muslims, non-Muslims are excluded from it, [2] it is more effectively managed in civic society, i.e. outside of government interference and [3] I don't feel the current government is educated enough on Sharia and any interference by the government in this area will only disrupt Muslims practising their religion or cause tension/hate against Muslims by the mainstream population.

The only thing I'd like the government to not do is begin enforcing authoritarian laws which make it difficult for Muslims to practise their faith like they do in France. It's funny how liberals bend over backwards to justify authoritarian dress code laws in France in the defense of secularism but heavily criticise countries like Saudi Arabia which does the same thing. In my case, I'm against both.

Sharia refers to the laws and restrictions upon which Muslims live their lives, i.e. not eating pork, fasting during Ramadan etc. There is already Sharia operating in the UK and there has been for as long as practising Muslims have been living here. I think as long as the government doesn't intervene in the lives of Muslims to make practising their religion (and thus living according to the principles of Sharia) difficult then Muslims will be happy. There is very little appetite for Sharia being regulated by government among Muslims in the UK, not only would it draw further animosity towards Muslims but it'd create countless problems between Muslims in terms of what actually constitutes Sharia, how it should be implemented, whether/how laws derived from Sharia should be enforced etc. The current system of anarcho-Islamism which operates in the UK, i.e. Sharia operating exclusively in civic society is the best solution. In fact, I'd be in favour of this system in Muslim countries with diverse religious groups like Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen as it'd avoid a lot of potential sectarian issues.",0,1370328819,null,0,false,0,cabtgan,t3_1fiijy,t1_cabtgan,t1_cabkqgx,null,1430932413,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Love Amelia, but can't stand the 11th doctor. It took me a few episodes to start liking the 10th after the 9ths run ended, but it's taking much longer for Matt Smith. He's not as mysterious and sincere. The 10th was charismatic, whimsical, and serious at appropriate times, but the 11th is just... goofy. All the time. And when he is being serious, it's just not believable. Honestly I can't even stand the way he looks. His ""lack of style style"" just seems so forced. Even his accent is annoying. And the whole bowtie thing just makes me cringe. 

The only times I've liked him honestly, is when he was acting like the 10th. 

It's kinda like they went down a list and made sure all the basic fundamentals of ""The Doctor"" are there, but there's nothing else there. He's just a bit off. Like an empty shell.

I'm not one to get attached, because I still can't decide whether I liked the 9th or 10th better, even though they were different, but personally I just can't get into it. 

I'm only in the first season of his run, so I'm holding out hope that he will get a feel for the role and perhaps develop a personality of his own.

I haven't watched any of his Ukranian League games, but I saw almost every Shahktar CL game this year. He's a boss player. He was playing a deeper role in the CL games, so I unfortunately haven't been to see him at AM. Him and Willian were clearly their 2 best players though, with Fernandinho a close 3rd. He's fast, clever with the ball and his movement, hard worker defensively, and a clinical finisher - although he only scored twice in the CL, so I'm basing that off word of mouth, highlight videos, and his stats. For comparison's sake, a lot of people compare him to Muller or Pedro mixed with Kuyt.

Edit: a lot people also compare him to a more dynamic Lampard because of his ability to score from inside the 18 yard box, on well timed trailing runs.",0,1370332666,null,0,1370336408,0,cabu4r4,t3_1flwhm,t1_cabu4r4,t1_cabk7bo,null,1430932092,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

No, that's not it. Henry VIII wanted his marriage to be annulled, which is different to a divorce. That would make the marriage have had no legal aspect to it and thus he could remarry just fine. The Pope wouldn't allow that (n.b. nothing to do with divorce, but annulling a marriage) and so Henry questioned the Pope's authority, didn't like how the papacy could tell the King what can and can't be done, and so the ties were severed and made himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England (they were careful with that because otherwise it could imply that the monarch is above God).

for me personally though i have a different skew on it (right or wrong its my take) i believe that opponents are opposed because they do not want gay marriage/partnership at all ! be it because their sky fairy 'tells' them its wrong or just because they are bigoted towards the gay community. either way its bullshit and we as a country,community and world have far bigger fish to fry than worrying about two people getting married in a church.

also i think many people are worried that a gay marriage would be a fantastic theatrical affair that would make most traditional celebrations look dour in comparison ;)

Should I avoid any countries?
7 Days isn't much time, I don't think you would be able to reach any that are to be avoided. Maybe Andorra, only because it will suck up too much time getting to and from there.

I did my first time over, second time it fell off. I've never heard of anyone having problems without one, best solution would be to have a numberplate with it printed on.

There are a few items that you are supposed to carry, bulbs, high viz vest etc.. but if you are travelling light I wouldn't worry too much.

Toll roads are quick, but boring. I would only use them if you are in a hurry. The ones in France generally have slopes to either side which makes the views pretty boring.

Because there is a moral argument - why is one legal and not the other (particularly when the one that is legal is more harmful to the individual and society. why should the state jail people who are having a joint whilst playing chess??? ) 

Alcoholics can die from liver disease by their 30's - how many cannabis users die young??

Alcoholics can die if they suddenly stop drinking - cannabis users do not if they suddenly stop smoking - I know this for a fact (after almost 20 yrs of constant all day smoking I stopped when I had a baby - basically zero side effects)

If we do not legalise it then criminal nasty gangs will be continued to be funded by a large section of otherwise law abiding people - I used to spend about £2000 - £3000 a year on weed as a single person, don't you want the tax man to get some if that or are you happy that criminal gangs profit from prohibition.

ps I am not the only person to think that alcohol is far far worse to society and the individual - i'm backed up by science, your thoughts are backed by what ?

http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm

The only major harm from cannabis is a result of prohibition and the fact that some criminal gangs are spraying contaminates on the weed to increase its weight - i.e

- this is what may cause an influx for the NHS - the fact that criminal gangs spay weed with silica and other nasties, this would be solved if it were legal..

Before I stopped smoking weed I stopped smoking tobacco (which I has smoked for about 22 yrs) - for about 2 years I just smoked neat weed - I became so so so much more healthy than when I smoked (legal) tobacco - my constant chesty cough disappeared and I looked so much more healthy and could run again. For me the health benefits of stopping tobacco far outweighed stopping cannabis - as long as they don't contaminate it with tobacco the NHS should have less need to intervene..

For example: In the supermarkets, a multi pack of branded crisps may contain 12 bags of crisps. Poundland's stock of the same branded crisps may contain fewer bags, say 10, at a cheaper price. The price for the pack is cheaper at poundland, but the price per bag, is more expensive. So it's actually more expensive to buy the product in Poundland.

Same goes for the 2005 revival. When only Rose had aired, we had no idea if it was going to continue along with the story. The first time that the past Doctors were even shown on screen wasn't until Tennant's Next Doctor special. Of course, the Time War came to light and began patching things up before that, but still.

Well, I'm a software engineer so I'd hope I had a basic grasp of the complexities at least - I did side step this issue however since I was more interested in the opt-out vs opt-in side of things.

&gt;Wouldn't it work much better if every new ISP connection comes with an infopack (either as a booklet or disc or even as the first step in the router setup sequence, so that the info cannot be missed accidentally) which includes a number to call to opt-in? This means only the minority of people who would want this service would be inconvenienced, rather than the huge majority of internet users without children.

Yes. For new connections, this is ideal.

Obviously that doesn't address existing connections.

Apparently the writer/director used to work as a producer for Big Brother and there is quite a Reality Show feeling about it (people stuck in a house, claustrophobic, experiments taken to the scientific extreme - and really, we're watching all this, so what does that make us?). 

I also seem to remember there's no soundtrack, which changes the tone and impact of scenes considerably. The scene where he chases the girl into the pool and traps her was quite mesmerizing - almost like watching a documentary about predators. So maybe there's more to it than the shock value, there might be references and semi-jokes and also food for thought",0,1370343424,null,0,false,0,cabvi86,t3_1fkogz,t1_cabvi86,t1_cabv4sk,null,1430931373,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;As all the world knows, the first industrial revolution happened in England; specifically, in a rather small part of England that was bounded on the west by Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, on the south by Birmingham, on the east by Derby, and on the north by Preston, the county town of Lancashire. Each of those cornerstones could claim some specific part in the dramatic events of the eighteenth century: at Coalbrookdale in 1709, Abraham Darby smelted iron with coal; at Derby, in 1721, the silk-thrower Thomas Lombe built the world's first recognizable factory; in Preston, in 1732, Richard Arkwright was born; in Birmingham, in 1741 or 1742, John Wyatt and Lewis Paul first applied the system of spinning cotton by rollers, which Arkwright would appropriate and improve. But one industry above all came to dominate England's pioneering path to industrialization, and one city above all became the centre and the symbol of the entire process, renowned worldwide and visited by inquiring pilgrims from every land. The industry was the manufacture of cotton, and the city was the commercial heart of that industry, Manchester.

However, it is down to the officer to state which power they are searching under and what the grounds were (Smell of cannabis, acting suspiciously near the scene of a theft etc) and by this, it means you cannot search someone because they volunteer to be searched. 

If you search someone and find something which proves an offence, the officer will be questioned surrounding the legality of that search. The legality of a search is given when written as a power, ie Section 1 PACE, Section 23 MDA, Section 60 POA. There is NO power to search if someone 'volunteers' for it and if they do search you, they are breaking the law. 
However, I know a lot of officers that will ask ""Are you happy to be searched now?"" purely because it builds rapport, and ensures the suspect is happy with the information that must be given to the suspect when being searched (Except under certain powers) reasons/grounds/who the officer is. At this point they are not consenting or volunteering, they're just accepting that the search is legal, because 9/10 a stop and search is legal and justified.

As such I was saying that I don't think they are transferable.  It's a bit unfair to say that London has got so many other museums, the marginal cost is less.  Because those museums don't surve science.

true,AugustusSnodgrass,null,null,"Firstly, you're in for a blast, some of my fondest memories are from trips like these. As far as actual advice goes I would offer the following --

Don't bother taking waterproofs - They are bulky, hopefully you won't need them and when you do it'll probably be too late by the time you can pullover and get them on. I gave up taking mine years ago and just made sure I had a dry T-Shirt to hand to swap out under my leathers.

Avoid Switzerland! - It's a beautiful country with some amazing roads but the Swiss are hard as hell on speeding and the like (this is the country where motorsports are illegal!). They have some pretty draconian powers to seize your bike and charge you a lot of money if you are caught breaking the law, everywhere else it's a slap on the wrist and tens of Euros and you're on your way.

Said before but try and take a few more days, you will inevitably arrive somewhere that's beautiful and idyllic or has the best biking roads you've ever seen and it's nice to have a spare day or two in your pocket. there's nothing worse than having to power through a place you want to explore because you've got to put the miles in to get back to the ferry/chunnel.

Personally I would rather camp over staying at B&amp;Bs. Campsites are ten a penny in that part of the world and some are in stunning locations. You can sit out on the grass and tinker with your bike and I always feel a bit more secure when you go to sleep and your bike is only 6ft away.

Gove, however, is playing with childrens futures. By changing the exams, he is locking a few years worth of children into his baseless claims that exams are better when they are more old fashioned, and people seem to be turning a blind eye because it doesn't effect them. Why haven't we had protests on the same level as student fees on Gove's messing about with the education system? That's much worse, in my opinion. 

Of course, Gove will probably be happy at the end of the day, because he's left his mark on the government (a policians main aim, other than making money and guarenteeing themselves a job in the future), and exams will be made artificially harder by making it so children have to remember all their three years of work for one exam.",0,1370346525,null,0,false,0,cabvya9,t3_1fn1wl,t1_cabvya9,t3_1fn1wl,null,1430931164,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

This is not especially contentious. The option for Male/Female couples to have civil partnerships was attempted to be stuck in there as a wrecking amendment by people opposed to the bill. But it was a red herring that there was never much real demand for.

A compromise was reached whereby the civil partnership system will be reviewed immediately. My expectation is that they will be eliminated gradually. They were a dirty little half measure in terms of the politics. Its great they existed, but they only did so as a way to *not* provide equality.

&gt;I feel its all a bit vague, and in the UK if the message is not articulated I fear they are in for a shock in the context of public backlash?

How so? The UK public is substantially in favor. For the vast majority of people this is neither controversial, nor especially interesting. Its a very small fringe of ranting nutcases who are turning this into a big issue and claiming the sky will fall. In the general population very few people even KNOW someone like these people, let alone have any kind of meaningful engagement with them. 

A small number of people shouting very loudly that there is a controversy, and public concern does not mean there is one.

But OTOH, that is what keeps me from letting it get too bad - my utter and total abhorrance of ending up like that, and ym desire for my life to be better than that keeps me going.

If other people don't have the same mindset, then they need to harden up a bit, and we need to take away one of their biggest incentives to not improve.

 In this case, it's the award for life and benefits that leave them better off than those of us who work (yes, I'm disabled, yes I work, no, I don't claim the benefits I am ""entitled"" to).

At any rate, I know a good number of ""disabled"" people who have otherwise full and active lives. I
 am always amazed, for example, at the number of women with bad backs, who seem to be able to have kids. How the hell does *that* work? 

You're right about attitudes, but that sort of change can only come from within. But we need to provide incentives to people, and to teach them to not be so defeatist.

Additionally, Bale on the left would hurt us by impeding his scoring ability.  Bale in the center hurts us because he is not a creative center midfielder; when he starts wandering around we lose an outlet in the center and so we can't move forward, and even when he is there it just does not suit him.  The right is where he belongs, with the occasional swap, but that means Lennon gets pushed out of that position.

Even if Lennon is starting on the right wing, we should not be reliant on him.  He gets injured every year for stretches of a few games at a time, and in the past that has caused us to slip trying to adapt without him.

Or they can reject it and send it back to the commons, or they can study it, revise it, and send it back to the commons.

The speed of this depends upon how the commons clerks timetable it.

What will happen if they do either of the latter two, is that the Commons will then pass EXACTLY the same bill, and it will become law, possibly with a delay.

This bill passed with on a FREE vote, with a majority of 205. A massive majority. All the amendments to change the bill were rejected, again by massive majorities, save the one mandating a review of civil partnerships (immaterial to the substance of the bill).

In order for there to be any changes, over 100 MPs would have to completely change their mind, of their own free will, and vote exactly opposite to how they had voted before, purely in response to having their will snubbed by an unelected review body. That is not just unlikely, it is unfathomable. The fact this was a free vote puts the full weight of the will of the House of Commons behind it.

At the longest the bill can be delayed by one year by the lords.  

This isn't a storm brewing. This is noise and thunder, by a small number of unrepresentative, unusual, unpleasant people, signifying nothing. 

EDIT: Just one thing I missed, there are a few potential legitimate gaps in the bill as written. The Lords may amend and revise these. It is entirely possible that the HoC may fully agree with these and want to pass them into law. However, based off the HoC vote, these will be amendments FAVORABLE to the LGBT community. Certain transgender issues, certain pension issues etc. This may slow down the bill to incorporate these changes, but trust me, those that are accepted will be GOOD.

I found all the writing up until the Sixth doctor awesome.  I found the production quality to be decent to where the story outweighed the low budget makeup.  

Then Colin Baker's first season starts;  just painful.  It wasn't at all good,  in a few episodes I got into the back story and sort of wished the Doctor and Peri would get off the screen. 

I actually liked the way Baker portrayed the doctor,  it was an angry almost snobbish genius with his heart well hidden.  Thought he nailed an aspect of the doctor that we had only gotten glimpses of before.   Around this time though the show's writing,  and pool of actors both seemed limited and cheap.  It really didn't matter who the Doctor was,  they would have been setup to fail.  

This painfully carries over to Mccoy in his first few stories and by the time he pulls you out of this downward spiral.  The show is over.  All in all it's a sad time for the classic show.  

I stand by my original post.  One should watch all they can of the first five Doctors  before watching the demise of classic Who.

Anyone who suggests using economic analysis to decide which museums to close, gets greeted with downvotes.  I just can't fathom what these people expect.  London already pays huge amounts in taxation, whilst receiving proportionally little, the issue here is how much you can neglect that in the name of re-distribution.  All of these can be explained economically, with the underlying philosophical inputs clearly stated.  Without even looking at the finances I'd hazard a guess that the london science museum is more profitable, the merchandising to the corporate events must bring in some decent revenue.

I'll go as far as to say it's the classic problem of reddits system and anything political.  It's the whole *I disagree with something different to my views* downvote, rather than having any validity or rational.

If you are lucky, some of them actually do still want to help people, but it seems more and more they seem to have to sneak it into their day and hope their manager doesn't catch them helping people.

As for advice, my main advice is write down EVERYTHING you do even vaguely related to finding work.  Edited your cv? put it down.  Looked in a newsagent window at the advert board. Put it down. Browsed any site for jobs, put them all down as separate items.  

At present, if you're lucky, you'll get the minimum of 30 things a fortnight, but that's going up soon.

I also upvote getting any extra free training or volunteering done, looks good on the CV and any gaps in work history look bad.  BUT, this is a big but, make sure you clear EVERYTHING with the job centre first, they need to fill out forms to make sure your training, volunteering, etc isn't going to interfere with your job search.

true,mrmunchkin62,num9-away,,"The ideas already posted are really good so I say we just synthesize all of them. For example, we have discussions scheduled on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. 

* Monday- 1st Team/Youth player profiles

* Wednesday- Linked players profile (in the same vein as the bernard thread the other day. Tbh after all the stories, I still know very little about Damiao)

* Friday- History lesson. 

I think since we all (correct me if im wrong) know at least some facts about the players on 1st team maybe we can focus on youth players but also cover a bit on who plays the same position on 1st team (so if someone decided to write on Obika, then they could also see to write a ""Shit you didnt know!"" about Ade or sometin.  

As for linked players I think this would be great to get everyone prepped for the first transfer. Of course we'll be linked to everyone and beyond but I think the more viable ones may be easier to recognize (Villa, Damiao, Pjanic, Porto striker, etc.) Maybe a lil write up of how he would fit in our system would be good too. 

I know we have ""Welcome Spurs Fans"" part in this sub that give you a history lesson but I think this would be interesting. One person picks their favorite season, or a manager, or even a great game (highlights would be great!) that not everyone might know about. Hell someone could even pick the Milan game in which Bale tore the opposition apart. Just anything from our past that you think might be worth talking about!

In order to suddenly, out of the blue, after ELEVEN male forms, see himself as female, there would have to be a plot-related reason. A deeply ingrained one.

Obviously we'll play Villa in the centre, or at least we better. But he needs to be our target man, not Bale. Gareth is a fabulous player, no two ways about it, and in a team with him in the centre, behind a striker, he's the obvious target. However, out wide, in the Bizzler's preferred 4-3-3, he's not an ideal target.

Yes, he can whip in an amazing cross, or whack it in the net from range, but I think we'd be wise to have Villa as our target man, with Gareth and Aaron roaming out wide.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"They were a band around for a while, they started out when they were kids. Tulisa and Dappy are cousins, Fazer is some black guy I can't remember how they knew him, childhood friend maybe. They were managed by Dappy's dad but he died a while back. Dappy is a reasonable solo artist, he's also a stereotypical council-estate type moron that has appeared on Nevermind the Buzzcocks a few times and made a tit of himself. 

N-Dubz made sort of pop-rap, you know the sort of stuff that appears in the charts and people happily listen to even though it isn't the greatest music, it's just, you know, listenable. They won quite a few awards, made a lot of big sales and then they went on hiatus last year, or it might have been the year before. I think they're going to resurface at some point in the future. 

I ""hated"" them for a while in that stereotypical, ""they're dumb lol i hate them"" way that teenagers hate things but then after their tour bus was parked outside my apartment one night in 2011 and I saw Dappy walking out I thought I should listen to them and so I did and their music is very listenable.

Here are a few songs, you'll see how generic pop they are. Not that generic is bad though, it's served them well and they have lots of fans. 

I need you - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxq-wCf5G8o (from 09, look at how child like they are :D)

I swear - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLfQknNxvFA (from 07 or possibly 08, even younger).

Personally I'm disappointed Tulisa did this, not a surprise but she is rich now and pretty hot, people never change eh. Grow up around drugs, sticks with it.

Here's a freestyle that Dappy did a while back, I'm sure the working class ""I want to be middle class so I'll hate everything to do with poor people"" of this subreddit will just hate him just 'cause he's a stereotypical poor moron that got rich but he is talented: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mMUs200dCs",0,1370360406,null,0,1370360659,0,cabzk0t,t3_1fnh0q,t1_cabzk0t,t1_cabzbgi,null,1430929464,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Not exactly. Since the introduction of the Parliament Acts, the House of Commons can pass legislation without the consent of the House of Lords. IIRC, the Lords can only block the passage of the bill for one year.

In theory, having an unelected second House serves as a review chamber, where experts in a particular area can be appointed and they do not have to be concerned with party politics or re-election campaigns.

In the last scene, the Valeyard and the Doctor are alone on a devastated planet with the dead all around them.

As he dies the Valeyard begins to laugh, the Doctor begins to glow with regeneration energy, ""Why are you laughing, I beat you, I WON!"" as the Valeyard takes his last breaths the camera pulls back to show the ruin that the Doctor has wrought.

There is no such things as as 'general search'. In fact, I have no clue what you are talking about in that regard. The police don't search you unless you're suspected of an involvement in an offence. The only time this is different, is under a condition of entry (say a club) or when a s60 is in place, usually at football games. In both of those situations, you still CANNOT volunteer to be searched. 

Police officers can only search a person using powers granted under an act. There is no other time. They have to work within their remit granted by legislation. There is no situation where a search can be voluntary. You don't seem to understand that?  If you are compliant during a search, you are not consenting.

He's tall and strong so he's obviously good in the air but he's also a decent dribbler, passer, holds the ball well, can finish with either foot, has amazing control (especially when using his chest) and he has ok pace. He can shoot from range, he can finish inside.

He also steps up in big games. Scored 5 goals and 2 assists in 5 games against United (could be off about the assists but the goals 100% sure).

Outside of football, he's an amazing person and good team mate. 

Cavani is better, no doubt, but Dzeko costs us £30 less which can buy us a world class midfielder which we need more than anything IMO

true,Kesuke,null,null,"This suggestion comes up every 3 or 4 months these days, before being promptly smacked back down again. It's a vile idea for a number of reasons...

* Far and away the biggest is that this is a simple way to introduce swathing censorship in small steps... Yes three midgets arse fucking a coked up prostitute is probably porn. But what about a cartoon or an erotic novel? What about a website that sells adult sex toys but has no overtly sexual content?... what about a political blog that has crude sexual puns and swearwords included in its user contributed comments section? Chances are the person introducing it would never intend it to be used to block other material - but it could easily be distorted further down the line into widespread censorship of all kinds of material.

* It won't really cut down the access children have to pornography, because at the end of the day many children will seek it out. I spent 4 months working in India where access to the internet isn't widespread. What did young men do (when they weren't raping underage girls on buses)...? Well, they shared hardcore pornography pics and videos on cheap mobile phones bought specifically for that purpose, and almost certainly kept well away from their overbearing indian mothers/wives! Some of these guys were 17/18, and I've no doubt they'd be doing it from a much younger age.

* We've moved on from the 1950s model of pornography being inherantly morally wrong, to a position where it is effectively legal (unless of course its illegl... but this isn't about illegal pornography which is an entirely seperate issue). So... we would be in the position of denying everybody the right to automatically access something which isn't even illegal. 

The answer to pornography on the internet surely lies in educating children at the right time *for them*, so that when they encounter adult material they have an understanding of what it is, what is good about it, and what the pitfalls of it are.

The real elephant in the room is that this represents little more than a feminist attack on men and their interests. I'm almost always left with the impression that proponents of automatic blocking are feminists with little interest in pornography themselves - who would happily see it banned entirely if it were up to them. I want to point out, I understand many women enjoy pornography... but I think even these days we can still appreciate that pornography is principally a male pass time. Indeed, just looking at the content gives you a clue to who the market are - - men. Scientific studies have also consistently shown that men masturbate considerably more than women on average (and indeed **masturbation is healthy and cuts the risk of testicular and prostate cancer**). So my point is... shut the fuck up. If you don't want your kids to download porn, either put blocks on every device they'll ever own or try to educate them not to do view it... but ultimately as mini-adults in the making the choice will be up to them no matter how hard you try or how many barriers you put in place.

As much as people in this thread are saying that the Lords serves some 'balancing purpose' or provides 'expert opinions' (two things I think are total nonsense), they were never the guiding principles in the design of Parliament. Much more, they are arguments which have been created after the fact to justify the continuation of the existing system.

Furthermore, there is strong institutional resistance to any change. To huge sections of politics, business and the civil service a seat in the HoL is the ultimate recognition of achievement - almost all former ministers get seats in the Lords for example.

If we strive towards total democracy, you tend to end up with situations where you have [tyranny by majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority), certainly not a good thing. I do like Switzerlands model of 
[direct democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy#Switzerland), though you need a politically active populace (which we don't).

So our [Westminster Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system), I think is a nice balance. We have checks and balances in the form of two houses and the Queen. The HoC represents the populace (although.. how they get to the HoC is [certainly up for debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post#Criticisms) ), whereas the HoL in theory should be composed of experienced professionals and experts who don't need to worry about a, possibly uninformed, electorate to pander to, and can make long term decisions for issues past the current election cycle. They are there to scrutinize legislation, tidy it up, and review it. 

Of course, the HoL [has it's own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Spiritual) [serious problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_for_Honours) and I think far too many old politicians are appointed to it as a ""reward""(i.e. to gain influence for the ruling party). It's appointment process also tends to mean the average age of the HoL pretty high, meaning a probably higher than average conservative slant.

However, I really do not agree with an elected HoL like the Lib Dems are pushing for. I think that an elected HoL will remove all of the HoL benefits while bringing to it all the downsides of the HoC.

Ideally, I'd like to see the HoL composed of politically neutral experts, civil servants, and people with life experiences in various industries. ",0,1370366324,null,0,false,0,cac1o5l,t3_1fnlgx,t1_cac1o5l,t1_cac15mx,null,1430928467,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Combined with a lack of a full pre-season, I think he deserves another season with us. Some of his better performances came out in the last few weeks of the season. Given some time and a full off-season to train, I think he'll be a lot better next year, provided he successfully adjusts to his new role.

I do love his scrappy goals though. Someone posted a great quote about him on this sub that pretty much sums him up, paraphrasing: ""If you watch him for a season, you think it's all luck.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Has Clint Dempsey been worth the transfer fee?

I feel that Dempsey was purchased for three reasons. Firstly, big target Moutinho and Damiao were missing and with 30 mins left on deadline day he was almost all that was available (had burnt bridges with Fulham and Fulham kinda didn't want to sell to Liverpool). He also gives Spurs the ability to gain new U.S. fans (see under armour and the 56 or so new supporter groups). Finally, he is good squad cover as he can play 3 positions at a PL level.

Business wise I think he has done great things in the U.S. Football wise I would say he is slightly below what I would have hoped. His clutch goals against Basel, Utd, Everton etc saved spurs from many red face moments and many of his goals led to 3 points (rather than making a 3-0 a 4-0). I would have liked to see him make a position his own as after 3 successful PL seasons a player like him (end of 'prime') should have been able to lock down a position after the loss of VDV. 

&gt;Worth the x-fer fee

Yes, I think any club would pay 6m to get the extra exposure spurs have gotten in the U.S. and he has proven to be a valuable (also at times, frustrating) squad player.

&gt;This season compared to last

Poorer, but as expected. He was the linchpin of Fulhams attack, at apurs he was 4th fiddle. I don't think his style suits the squad in comparison to a Gylfi or Holtby which will always make replicating last seasons form an uphill battle.

&gt;Not impressive goal tally

See above comment. From 90 minutes a week and the focal point of the attack he has become a 45-60 mins a week player who isn't in his favourite spot and is also well down the pecking order as far as goal scorers is concerned.

&gt;Consistency

A woeful start to the season, but when he turned that around I think he showed that he is adequate squad cover for a few spots. Not the type of guy you want to have to start against someone like Chelsea but the guy who can sink a goal or two into Norwich (what we need).

I agree we need to work on political activism...  And yes, their direct democracy is far superior to ours, which is embarrassing.

More checks than balances I fear...

I'd debate that fiercely - it doesn't, and representative democracy sucks big time anyhow.

&gt;the HoL in theory should be composed of experienced professionals and experts who don't need to worry about a, possibly uninformed, electorate to pander to, and can make long term decisions for issues past the current election cycle. They are there to scrutinize legislation, tidy it up, and review it. ... Ideally, I'd like to see the HoL composed of politically neutral experts, civil servants, and people with life experiences in various industries. 

That sounds a lot like a technocracy, from which you can thoroughly count me out.  Horribly undemocratic and authoritarian - one of the reasons southern Europe is in outright rebellion.

true,tdeff19,1953,,"First things first. Bring everyone back after the holiday and do a squad evaluation.

Purchase:
Shaw (Southampton) - agree on a fee to joing Summer 2014; loan back. He has shown glimpses of quality and can be a very good prospect for when Cole calls time on his career. Him and Bertrand can provide depth that's needed for some time to come. He's home grown, and a Chelsea supporter. It makes perfect sense. Bertrand has the capability to understudy Cole if need be during this season.

Schurrle (Leverkusen) - if this deal goes through, it means most likely de Bruyne is heading the opposite way for a season-long loan. Which works out perfectly for both parties. He can lead the line if need be and can turn into a super sub if Torres or Ba need to come off or are injured. It's a role player - and one we could use in a variety of different ways.

Varane (Real Madrid) - this is my outlandish signing. And one that, I feel, could be an absolute game-changer for the club. He's arguably THE best young CB in the world and doesn't quite fit Real Madrid's role of ""Galactico Star"". He could be the focal point of our defense for years to come. There's no doubt a premium would have to be paid for his service since it's Madrid. I feel that Ancelotti or whoever the next Real Madrid manager is, will rather look to buy a new CB to pair with Ramos rather than give Varane playing time. Mourinho can develop him into world-class. There's probably 0.5% chance of this transfer to happen, but I feel it could be the signing of the season.

(I don't feel a need to bolster our midfield to suit a ""double pivot"". We're already stacked. People are forgetting we're getting Essien back, still have Romeu to develop, McEachran, Mikel, Ake, Ramires, Lampard, David Luiz, and Oscar who can be deployed in deep midfield. There should be a focus on developing them first into the role. I'm certain at least 3-4 of those players can be molded into the players we need to fill that role.)

Loan Out:
Lukaku - find a strong side in the Premier League where he can enjoy regular runs of games. With Torres/Ba/Schurrle, he'll have to fight for a place. I can see him return to West Brom or head over to Swansea. I wouldn't rule him out at Aston Villa especially if they're forced to sell Benteke. He'll get the playing time he needs and I can't see Ba with us past 2014 due to his age and injury history so he'll slot in that role nicely.

I think a major part of his low goal tally is the same problem that we faced all season.  We could not for the life of us create a lot of good chances.

When you're not getting chances, you're not getting those either.  

I think that was also an issue that led to his lack of consistency.  No one was consistent for us in attack, save for Bale and Dembele.  Dempsey was another one who suffered from the whole team being out of sorts for large portions of his games.  He'll get his goals if he gets more touches, as shown for both Fulham and the US.

It's true that soldiers abusing civilians seems rarer than extremists killing for Jihad; but nether the less both cases show that there is an underlying problem.

&gt; * And he has already won one political point off Abramovich, signing Frank Lampard to a further year.

~~How should the prestige of grammar schools be raised?~~

Edit: Ok, now you've added some text, I can give a proper reply.

The main problem with grammar schools is that they were based on bad science, and fraud by Cyril Burt - who was a psychologist and strong proponent for grammar schools and IQ testing, but made up many of his results.
He claimed  that children's intelligence for the rest of their life can be reliably determined at age 11, and that's why grammar schools select at that age.

http://www.intelltheory.com/burt.shtml

In practice, it turns out that grammar schools don't really select for how innately smart a child is, instead they select for how middle class their parents are, and how much resources they're prepared to spend on personally educating their child.

Grammar schools are essentially classist institutes (they discriminate against the poor, and children with badly educated parents), masquerading as elitist.

Obviously, it's much better for middle class kids to go to grammar school, but this also means that everyone that doesn't get in gets a worse education.",0,1370368228,null,0,1370371924,0,cac2em6,t3_1fnwgu,t1_cac2em6,t3_1fnwgu,null,1430928050,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

true,scratchyrock,null,null,"We each got one mini head pillow from target about $2-3 dollars

We bought a regular sized dark blue pillow case. Cut it in half to equal the size of one mini head pillow (we bought two reg. size pillow covers to use for the 3rd mini pillow)

we bought one soft black pillow case for the Police call box sign cut into  2""x30"" strips to wrap the front and back of the pillow. 

the white windows were made from an old cotton shirt cut into small roughly 1""x2"" 1/2 rectangles

I went online and found a nice large file size picture of Police Box sign and then measured it out from ""P"" to ""X"" to be 11"" to cover the face of the pillow. I printed it out and pasted it to a cereal box cardboard. Then used a razor to cut out each letter and used this as a stencil.

We bought a white spray paint made to be used for clothing and just stenciled the Police Box sign onto the black cloth strips we made.

If we had plenty of more time and wanted to really make these look pro we would have sewn them all together but instead we went for the easier route and got clothing glue and stuck all the window panels and police box signs to the mini pillow

Because the blue pillow case is half of a large one the sides needed to be glued shut again. Other wise it would be like a pancho cover over the pillow. Or maybe more like a skirt wrapped around the pillow.  ",0,1370368539,null,0,false,0,cac2j3d,t3_1fnx4j,t1_cac2j3d,t3_1fnx4j,null,1430927991,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I was down to go to a grammer school before Labour turned it into a comprehensive. My parents instead opted to send me to a private school, where I mixed with a much more restricted group of people from one specific subset. I got a better education than others based purely on money rather than merit.

Parents want their children to have the best possible future prospects, and no matter what they will always compete intensively for that. Grammer schools at least mean that rather than spending years pretending to be Jewish or Christian or spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on a house near a good school it is based on merit and achievement of the child.

We have elitism now. It is based on these arbritrary factors which benefit the established upper classes and their entrenched priviledge

An improved version of grammer schools with a much more holistic approach, better examination system and better targetting would massively help education in this country as well as social mobility and a general culture of meritocracy. The problem in the 90's wasnt with private schools, but a lack of investment or innovation in the education system

We are not all going to grow up to be scientists, doctors or academics. There is an inherently unequal lottery of birth based on our genes which largely dictates our potential. However, the state can help maximise the number of poor, working class people who need the most help to maximise their potential by focusing on them and by targetted teaching.

The best private schools are good because they focus on what is best for each individual student, not the class as a whole. ",0,1370369541,null,0,false,0,cac2xe4,t3_1fnwgu,t1_cac2xe4,t3_1fnwgu,null,1430927804,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

I wasn't dehumanising them or calling them monsters. We've all met shitcunts. All the shitcunts we've met have been human.

I would claim that both the soldiers in this story and the Woolwich accused (yeah I know there's little doubt they murdered that poor bloke but we have to wait for the trial, we're British damnit) were much more representative of other categories of people than they were representative of British soldiers or Muslims.

When we talk of representation in this way we're referring more to whether they reflect a typical soldier /Muslim than we are saying that they are an envoy for that grouping.

I think that the relative frequency of soldiers abusing civilians and extremists killing for jihad is arguable but would claim that abuse by soldiers is probably very much more common, especially if we don't define the nationality of the soldiers. If you think about the level of abuse being reported here then it's probably quite common.

Minor point - the saying is [kid gloves](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/treat+with+kid+gloves)

The problems of extremism, imo, are problems with a psychological genesis and seek expression in ""political"" or ""religious"" actions according to opportunity and milieu. A good example would be [The Shankill Butchers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shankill_Butchers), people that hid their serial killing behind paramilitary trappings. 

I think my point is that extremists of whatever stripe: [Republican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army), [Unionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Freedom_Fighters), [Muslim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Quida), [Communist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader-Meinhof_Gang), [Zionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Gang) or [Christian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Rudolph) bear much more in common with each other than with the mainstream of whatever group they claim to ""represent.""",0,1370369626,null,0,false,0,cac2ykw,t3_1fn9x3,t1_cac2ykw,t1_cac29ml,null,1430927788,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;Whilst at Tottenham he has played 22 premiership games, scored 7 and assisted 4. Markedly lower than his Fulham tally.

According to his Wikipedia page, he has 29 PL games for us (that includes 7 substitution appearances) and 7 goals.  That is one goal every 4.14 appearances.  If we count all of his games, that is 43 appearances and 12 goals, or one goal per 3.58 games.

Now look at his numbers for Fulham.  184 PL appearances with 50 goals, which comes out to one goal every 3.68 games.  All competitions, 225 games with 60 goals, one goal per 3.75 games.

His last two seasons (especially the last one) at Fulham were the outliers of his career.  He dropped off a bit, but its not bad for switching teams, formations, limited game time, and no longer being the primary attacking outlet.

Ok I know there are multiple threads where people have talked about this; however, I feel like no one has talked realistically about it. What I mean by that is everyone is throwing out names of people that are not going to be the next Doctor...lets be honest Cumberbatch would have been amazing; if he had got the job last go around but he is too big now and the reason he did not get it last time was because Moffat liked him more for Sherlock. Idris is in the same boat...he is becoming bigger (thanks God the name deserves it) plus he has Luther. Ben Whishaw, Tom Hiddleton, are in the same boat...they both are starting to find Hollywood success and as much as I would love them in the role they do not have the time. Lastly Chiwetel Ejiofor would be great but he about to explode with 12 Years a Slave coming out this coming Oscar season (if you don't know anything about it and who is making it then google it) which he will probably get nominated for...

here are some people that I think you could see:

Andrew Scott- has worked with Moffat and has shown that he can be just a crazy as he can be dramatic.

Domhnall Gleeson- He is having his first Hollywood film About Time but it is a smaller film that I do not see as some Hollywood break out role...he is a pedigree actor who has shown some great acting chops plus the Doctor has always wanted to be a ginger and he really looks the part to me.

Paterson Joseph- He was heavily considered last time but unlike the others really considered before he hasn't had any break outs...he is older at 48 but he have had older doctors in the past...plus he is hilarious but at the same time an accomplished Shakespearean actor.  

Here are three others that I think could fit as well Robert Sheehan, Aidan Turner, Harry Lloyd (know he played a villain in the past but I know he impressed the ppl at Doctor who at the time)

Some others that I have heard people say that I think could be options are Rory Kinnear, Stephen Mangan, and Damien Molony

true,godismanen,flair3,,"Has Clint Dempsey been worth the transfer fee?
Yes. He has a decent goal return for being played out of position so much and he defends more and better than his predecessors Kranjcar and Van der Vaart did.

How would you rate his first season with Tottenham compared to previous seasons?
I didn't watch Fulham consistently enough to comment on this but I think at Fulham and with the United States Dempsey was regarded by his peers as more of a leader on the pitch and this gave him the confidence to play at a high level. Most of the goals he has scored for us don't demonstrate the quality finishing he can bring to a team when he is the go to player.

Why has he not had as impressive a goal tally?
Earlier in the season he got more opportunities to play in the hole (Bale's current position in a way) and he simply wasn't in form at this point. Later on his form improved but he was asked to play in a part of the pitch (the left wing) where he was more likely to participate in the build up to goals than in finishing them. On the wing he tended to drift inside which created problems for players in the middle of the pitch which in turn hindered the development of our attacks as we were too congested in the middle of the park and hence easy to thwart offensively. most of the 'chances' he ended up havinf were ridiculous long range efforts that veered away from the goal.  

Also he didn't get as many headed goals off corners as you might have expected which is probably more the fault of our ridiculous employment of Kyle Walker as a set piece taker and Thudd's inconsistent delivery

Even in the places where they were removed it was (almost?) always put to a public vote.

The fact is that whilst they sound great in principle there are numerous logistical issues: How do you build enough to ensure that people can easily get to school, how do you ensure that a smart kid has the same chance of admission no matter where in the country they are - so you need the distribution of grammar schools to match the distribution of smart children which isn't easy, even assuming you can measure 'smart'.

Lastly people tend to forget that the grammar system condemned 70% of the population to frankly terrible secondary modern schools. This means that statistically your child is more likely to end up with a sub-standard education.

So whilst many parents initially supported the grammars as they imagined how much it would help their little cherubim, once the reality came clear - that most kids (including some of theirs) would be sent to the sink schools, they rapidly changed their minds.",0,1370370882,null,0,false,0,cac3g6p,t3_1fnwgu,t1_cac3g6p,t3_1fnwgu,null,1430927558,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Tennant wanted to leave because he felt that he couldn't go up anymore with his performances as the Doctor.  He didn't want his presence as the Doctor to grow too long and boring.  He also had other acting obligations, which is why his final ""Season"" is just a collection of specials.

But he loved being the Doctor.  I think Matt is leaving for the same reasons.  Though some of the episodes were weak this season, Matt's acting was top not every time.  He probably feels that he doesn't have any more to bring to the Doctor.  One good thing about Doctor Who, is that it affords great actors, like Tennant and Smith, to step in and do as much as they can with the part and leave.  Their departure the doesn't kill the show, but only provides the opportunity for another actor to come in and do great things with the character in his own way.

With that said, I am prepared to hate the new Doctor for the first few episodes until the actor does something amazing with the part and wins me over lol.

Removing modules has put a lot more pressure on the final exam. Let's take Biology, for example. As far as I can remember, the exam was split up into three parts, B1, B2 and B3, and these exams where each at different parts of the year, with some being done during Year 10, and some during Year 11.

Gove wants to have all the exams done at the end of the course. Previously, you'd be doing the exams at intervals in the year, splitting up the course, and meaning you wouldn't have to look back too far to revise. With the new system, you'll have to look back to work you did at the start of Year 9 for an exam at the end of Year 11, near enough 3 years before! 

Also, this means kids will have to remember a lot more stuff, seeing that basically of all their exams and the vast majority of their marks (bar some science coursework) will come at the end of Year 11. A childs intelligence shouldn't be based upon how good their memory and cramming skills are, it should be on actually how intelligent they are. What Gove wants is a more old fashioned system, based upon kids remembering as much as possible, which experts and teachers disagree on.

Furthermore, he has stopped January exams. Previously, if you fluffed up an exam, you could retake it the following January. This means that if, for example, there was a reason you couldn't do an exam to your fullest potential in the Summer (say, your parents died the night before), you'd only have 6 months to wait, and in January, you wouldn't have many exams anyway, meaning less revision.

Now he has moved all exams into Summer, stopping January exams, making it more difficult to have retakes. A retake isn't easy. It is still the same difficulty. It is putting children at a disadvantage because they, for whatever reason, couldn't do the first exam properly. 

Then you had a lot of fluff about him only wanting to make certain exams i-levels, not including ones like RS and Art. I'm not sure whether he went back on this, but that was a pretty silly idea, valueing 'old fashioned' subjects like the Sciences and Maths higher than the arts. 

Also, you have the farce over free schools, with a lot more religious schools being set up, and schools only getting funding if they become a free school (I know a school near me only became a free school to get funding to repair some buildings). 

So, overally, basically everything Gove has gone has been counterproductive and against what teachers want, going back to a more traditional system just because that's what he thinks is best, ignoring the objections from a majority of teachers, and burning bridges along the way.",0,1370374343,null,0,false,0,cac4s7z,t3_1fn1wl,t1_cac4s7z,t1_cac34ic,null,1430926928,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;I can actually sympathise with the ""technically difficult"" thing, not everyone is good with computers, no problem ISPs offering a ""we'll do all the hard work at our end"" service at their end for these people, but to cry ""think of the children"" on the one hand and then moan about 30 minutes of concentration is just amazing.

Yes I sympathise too but most people have a techy mate who could set this up for them for in return for some beer and pizza, surely? I suspect most of us here on Reddit are the unofficial tech support for family and friends.

It's not like 30 minutes is a long time either, that's one episode of corrie or eastenders at the end of the day, and MS provide documentation for their parental controls. How much easier can they make it before they just bundle it all pre-installed and then the EU says ""non""?

true,spongebob391,null,null,"People seem to think we need more players and I don't seem to understand why. The only area we are lacking is up front and at LB. We will need a LB because Bertrand is not up to the standards of Cole who is leaving in a season, so bringing in Shaw will be the only transfer I would make.

* DEF        -    Otherwise, we are stable in defense with good cover for all our positions. Ivanovic can cover for Azpi when needed and Luiz goes back in defense. Bruma is also out on loan that could be brought back.

* CDM       - When you look at our midfield, we have lamps, mikel, ake, ramires, luiz,  romeu, josh and essien that are all CDM. That's 8 players that can play in front of defense, why would we need another CDM. Except for Mikel, who is very lethargic in his style, everyone can be molded into a free passing midfielder. That solves the problem of transition from defense to attack that everyone keeps talking about.

* CM/CAM      -  Up front, Kdb has show that he can shoot, make eye of the needle passes and has mata-like control of the ball. Bring him back. We don't need to loan him out especially when he's playing at the level that he played last season. So, we'd have mata, hazard, oscar, moses, kdb , ramires and Marin. Again, 7 players to play the 3-role. Agreed, Marin has been disappointing this season but if we look at this season, he was hampered by injury and didn't get too much playing time. He deserves another season to prove himself. 

* ST       -      We made the mistake of offering Torres a 4 year deal with astronomical wages, so I don't see him leaving because no one will dare match those wages. And making a Malouda out of him would just be detrimental to the team's morale.Bringing in another striker would be pointless, especially since we have Lukaku and he's someone we can mold into a top striker.Why should we give that privilege to someone else. He's just as good as Ba and Torres if not better. We just have to stick with Torres until his contract is up in two years and then we can move on. If we brought in another striker there would just be too many unhappy players because we can only play one striker assuming we stick to the 4-2-3-1.
My opinion would be to make Lukaku and Ba starters and Torres playing in cup competitions because he's best when playing lower division clubs.


* GK - As for keeper, we could probably get Courtois back and play him and cech in alternate games like with Lindegaard and De gea.  With the number of games we have, they can each play a game a week for the most part. This way we could slowly phase cech out and make Courtois our number one. 


Finally, I think the most important transfer for the next few years has already been made in Mourinho. The team counts for nothing if they don't play like one regardless of the quality in the squad. We have spent way too much in the past few years but now the club is stable and our academy players and new signings look promising with bright futures ahead. I just think it's time we stopped buying players and started creating them. 
Just to give you an example of how our system has failed recently. Matic was a make-shift in the luiz deal and when he played against us, he absolutely destroyed our midfield. Benfica currently values him at 30 mil. If we keep buying our way into staying in the champions league, I'm  sorry to say that I don't see us being regular title contenders years down the line the way United always are.",0,1370374724,null,0,false,0,cac4xin,t3_1fnt21,t1_cac4xin,t3_1fnt21,null,1430926859,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

true,Zombiezee,null,null,"I could totally get into a Kotor/Mass effect Style Doctor Who game working with moral decisions and some action arcade style puzzle solving. And we are not talking lightside darkside doctor here…  I think much of what is great about doctor who is how far is he willing to go in certain situations. He has said he has crossed the line before and this style play I think allows the viewer to explore those cases.  Those games are all about companions as well so that plays in well to Doctor Who.  

I am surprised to see people not wanting Doctor Who in a video game format. Considering how the Whovian universe itself has crossed into so many different mediums.  Given to the right development team a Who game would be a perfect place to explore aspects Doctor who that maybe are not feasible to a shows budget or stuff only imagined yet not seen from Who books. 

I truly believe in the video game medium, while they have their own technically limitations in some regard, and it ability to blend small screen and book magic for even larger scale who adventures. 

And as pointed out it is Bioware that is behind Mass Effect. EA is just the all mighty distributor.  I would love to see the team behind Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age or Mass Effect(a sci-fi that touches on some of the same tropes that Doctor Who does) work on a Who game as Bioware does an excellent job on stories and solid gameplay. However the stumble in your suggestion here goes back to EA itself. They are not really known for doing things that do not have a mass appeal. And while Doctor Who is obviously popular, EA just got its hands on Star Wars property and I would imagine has directed their developers to focus on that property which will have a larger mass appeal, especially when Disney starts kicking off their movies in that universe.

I could see Valve being able to pull off an FPS with a Doctor Who heart to it. (Two hearts I suppose). Look at the Portal series. FPS does not always was have to be about pure violence – and yes I see the irony in that statement considering FPS has shooter in it. And while I am not suggesting the sonic screwdriver gets to be used like the portal gun… but I could see other puzzle game play mechanics put into place using the screwdriver or different alien technology that The Doctor finds along the way (potential Torchwood spinoff game there with all those fun adult themes). I mean let’s face it that screwdriver can pretty much do whatever the writers want it to do until they need some suspense and then it does not work. 

Granted if it keeps Valve from working on Half-life 3 than I am afraid my inner gamer trumps my inner Who … I NEED MY HALF-LIFE 3.

This might be a bit nostalgic for me but a Myst style point and click game is a great medium for Doctor Who. Those type games have a lot less violence and are all about the searching for clues and uncovering mysteries.  This also fits into what was suggested with the Walking Dead game (not the unfortunate sole survivor one but the episodic story one)

Hell I would play a Doctor Who Pong game where a TARDIS is one paddle and the other paddle is a Dalek.  If this does not already exist I need a programmer and a Kickstarter page stat. 

Unfortunately history also works against you hear as there are far more failures to Movie/ TV property going to video games as some of those abominations are pure cash grabs. But like I said the right developer with Who people taking an active role in story development the potential is there for a great game.

I think history, maths, English and the sciences (maybe) should be held in a higher priority than say a foreign language, or geography or philosophy because there's a greater density of skills learnt. For example, you'll learn the most mathematical skills from maths therefore that should be held as a priority. You'll learn the most English based skills in English therefore that should be held as a priority. In subjects such as philosophy I'm sure you'll also gain English skills how ever you'll improve on them less per/hr than say in English class.


My justification for why History should be compulsory.

I had an exam that consisted of 4 essays (these were under exam conditions with no prior planning as such). So essay writing is a skill I've learnt which will come in handy after school. As no matter what you do at university it'll have some written elements.

The other exam was solely on source analysis. This involved evaluation and critical thinking. You have to look at what the source says and why they've said it. These skills will help in jobs such as the police, counselling and therapy, legal related, politics, human resources. And I'm sure there are many more jobs were judgements will have to be frequently made while taking into account other factors.

As a party on the rightwards side of right UKIP are always going to attract individuals that don't like gay marriage or multiculturalism.

In exactly the same way as parties on the simialr side of the left (like the Green party) are always going to attract a few odd apples who probably ought to be classed as eco-terrorists and anti-capitalists).

BUT, a clear distinction has to be made between a racist party like the BNP or National Front, and a party with some racist members like UKIP. Strikes me the two are fundamentally different. I also applaud the fact that UKIP do genuinely seem to be trying to rat these people out... fair enough slowly, but in deference to them they are a new party, are attracting a lot of rapid interest and don't have anywhere near the income of other mainstream parties, so policing their members is going to be more difficult and time consuming for them. But, I honestly think Farage doesn't want them in his party anymore than anyone else wants that sort of person.

It's easy to use words like racism to dismiss UKIP but when 20% of the electorate are inclined to vote for them, I think we have to open our eyes a little bit and deploy some empathy towards their concerns over immigration and the EU. Clearly, multiculturalism has not been the panacea for everything that some people in the political class would seem to imply.

**Tl;dr... There are so many things wrong with UKIP but I genuinely don't think, for the most part, that racism is particularly one of them**

EDIT: Oh dear, judging by the downvotes it seems the guardian reading sandals brigade are out for my blood on this one. I won't be voting UKIP, but simply making the case that if you want to hate them, why not start with a genuine reason like their retarded policies that would have been considered socially backwards in the 1950s. Racism is a non-starter and if anything, dismissing them as racists actually plays into their hands - - because it distracts from genuine critique of their policies, and is easy for them to disprove or at the very least be seen to be addressing (as indeed they are).

So his role was radically different between Fulham and Spurs, and this shows in his statistics. His efficiency didn't radically drop, though the results did, thanks mainly to less playing time (3,323 minutes (89.8 per match) vs 1,998 minutes (68.9 per match)).

Sure, attack the HoL as an institution for being undemocratic, but the gay marriage bill is not the best stick to beat them with. The percentage in favour in the Lords would have been higher still, if you disregard the votes of the CoE (which I do, mentally).

Additionally, the HoL has the power to delay the passage of legislation, but not to block it completely. No matter how big a fan I am of extending the institution of marriage to gay men and women in the UK (and I am), I am still in favour of the HoL voting on legislation which the Government introduces without a mandate. When the HoC introduces legislation which they've not outlined in their (the parties') manifestos, they too act in an undemocratic way.

If the opportunity to take advantage of private education is there, people will take it (and arguably, depending on where they live, perhaps even should take it), but that kind of reasoning glosses over the idea that if the opportunity was not there at all, we would all have a greater impetus to improve the entire system, which would benefit us all and help repair the damage it is doing to society. Currently, many parents are simply not participating in the public education system in any way; this is unacceptable.

I will again liken this to a real world pub, if you’re a regular (and especially if you have a long history and standing within the pub) you need to be nice to new faces, it is ok to correct people but if you come across as a total jerk to new faces then they are not only going to find a new pub they are going to tar everyone in the pub with the same brush.

If you are corresponding to someone that is within the same professional sector and has written the policies that you adhere you need to be very careful what you post. Sarcasm does not come across well unless you are face to face and when you call into question the reputation of a person that has to speak before those that dictate policy you could be doing real harm.

Although I do now have a very junior post I’ve more of a history than I’m willing to share. 

Please do not consider that I am offended or bitter, I’m a very live and let live person but you run your pub as you wish and that is fine but if a long standing member calls into question my integrity when they know that weight of that question I’m going to leave.

Youngsters like Kakuta are good, but really are quite a far distance from slotting into the first team within 2 years. Keep in mind that some of these guys are 21. When they get up around that age, if it's determined there's not a first team future, it's better for their development for them to find another club. Just because it doesn't work out at Chelsea, doesn't mean they can't find success elsewhere.

Notice how I also included ""I don't feel a need to bolster our midfield to suit a double pivot"". I find the Wesley Sneider and Daniele DeRossi links completely stupid and not relevant to our long-term project.

See Mancienne, Sala, Tore, and others as perfect examples - not needed and not part of Chelsea's first team plans, but they're playing their trade elsewhere. Daniel Sturridge is a perfect example. He was never going to thrive at our club. His development stalled and was never more than a squad player. The decision was made to sell him to Liverpool. Sure, he's a good player for Liverpool. Would you want him back? Would you think he could supplant Torres, Ba or Lukaku for a first team place? That's the question you have to ask and a question the manager faces when evaluating a squad.

If the amount of cocaine involved in the crime is 5 grams or less than she can be given a suspended sentence and community service order, if the amount of cocaine is over 5 grams then it **has** to be a custodial (prison) sentence, on the upper end of that 4.5 year limit and up to a maximum of 7 years.

I can't work out if the amount of cocaine she is said to have helped supply (conspiracy), is more than 5 grams. How much would £800 (as media is reporting) buy you at the moment on the street?

My bet is that her lawyers will try to prevent her being charged by the police and CPS by saying that the evidence has been falsified and is fake, this is probably why the police haven't charged her yet, only arrested her and then bailed her. If they can prove that it was really her on the video with a third party eye witness testimony or CCTV evidence showing her in the bar then it's game over for her, she's definitely getting at least an 18 month suspended sentence and a 300 hour+ community service order, and more likely (if £800 of cocaine is over 5g) she'll be getting about 4.5 years in prison, having to serve 2.25 of those years.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Hard one to discuss because as others mentioned, he doesn't have much footage around.

From my viewing the U-21 side thrives on having superstar Tom Carroll in midfield, devastating wingers (Pritchard, Townsend and Mcevoy) and then U-21 heavy weight Obika in front of them. Sometimes Kane chimes in from either the left, the hole or as striker. 

The team mirrors the first team and play in a 4-3-3 / 4-2-3-1. Mcevoy plays typically on the right and loves to use his pace to burn a player whipping in a decent cross when all is said and done. Style wise he reminds me of Lennon, hugging the shoulder of the fullback with the intention of timing a run in behind, but unlike Lennon he also has a decent final ball. He was a great goal scorer last year and some of the crosses he whipped in this season really troubled opposition defences (lots managed to bounce in the box, which is probably due to poor defending more than anything).

As far as 'natural ability on the ball' is concerned, I haven't really seen any evidence of fancy feet with him, I think 'confidence on the ball' is a better descriptor. Good at bringing it down (the youth teams seem to love long balls and switches) and doesn't typically turn it over. Imagine the pace and width of Lennon with the shot + crossing ability of Siggy, that is who he reminds me of. Actually, come to think of it, he is a fair bit like Theo Walcott. 

&gt;Pros

Pace

Crossing

Shooting

Ball Control

&gt;Cons

Throws his hands in the air a bit too often

Relies on pace to beat his man

Goal scoring form took a dip last season

Doesn't track back and take on defensive duties

&gt;For the future

At 18 years of age I actually think he could be up for a C'ship loan. Like I said, he is one of the key 4 in the spurs attack and the other players (Kane, Obika, Pritchard, Carroll and Townsend) have all had or are good enough for a c'ship loan. Granted his tender age (and physique, another skinny guy, Levy must not feed them) another season in the youth side would also be nice. If I had to put together a list of 4 youth players that I think could make it, Mcevoy would probably make the list. He is a key player in the U-21 squad and probably at a low C'ship level at the young age of 18. At his current rate of progress I can see him being another Townsend in 3 years time.

Yup. That's Moffat's easy-out. As long as he's showrunner, he can use River as much as he wants. 

Him being showrunner is indeed a problem. He's brilliant with his stand-alones, but I think he has failed completely when heading up Doctor Who. Overall, I've felt very skeptical of the series since he took over. I don't say this as some raving Tennant fanboy, either. I started with Nine, enjoyed him, watched Ten (and it took several episodes to warm up to him, too) but I didn't feel that Eleven really found his groove until this season. This is due in part to the way that Moffat is doing things.

If we don't end up bringing in another CM, and we do make a switch to the 433, it'll be up to him and Holtby to handle most of that third midfield spot.  I honestly think a loan to someone like Swansea may do him good.  Europa League football would be awesome for him, and I think he'd get more game time there than with us.

Townsend looked amazing for QPR.  Because of the way his ban is carried out, he won't miss any game time with us it seems.  Depending again on the switch to a 433, he should get some decent time.  

Caulker should be getting his fair share of minutes too.  With Gallas out, I think he will be heavily rotated, particularly in Cup and EL matches.  Really excited for those three, for me they've shown their capable of handling the PL to an extent, and I think they'll keep improving.

Don't know much about any of our young strikers.

The idea is that you start with one of the dark yellow ""starter novels"", but, in reality, as long as it doesn't connect to another one before it via a dotted line, you won't miss anything by not having read any of the others.  The exception to this is *Thief of Time*, which I think ought to have a solid line to *Hogfather* because of the character development of Susan Sto Helit.

That said, unless you're a stickler for such things, none of the books, except for *The Colour of Magic* and *The Light Fantastic*, and *Sourcery* and *~~Faust~~ Eric* follow directly on from one another, they just happen to the same characters.  Kind of like if I told you the story of how I went to America last year, you wouldn't lose anything by not knowing I broke my wrist when I was nine.

If the premise of a particular book catches your interest, start with that.  I started with *The Fifth Elephant* because I liked the cover design, no other reason.  My actual favourite is *Lords and Ladies*.

A lot of people don't recommend starting with *The Colour of Magic*, *The Light Fantastic* or *Equal Rites* as they have a bit of a different feeling to the rest of the books.

true,heffalump232,null,null,"It's a very loaded question. If you're asking me whether I'm in favour of grammar schools, yes, but rather because I also believe in a return to well-funded, technical schools.

Comprehensive education was based on the idea that everyone should receive a grammar-school education. At the time, grammar schools became increasingly unpopular because:

1. There weren't enough grammar schools, meaning that the pass mark for the 11+ kept getting higher, provoking middle-class parents to complain.

2. Because the secondary-moderns were woefully underfunded and treated as a scrapheap for the 75% who didn't gain a place at the grammar school. 

However, a core belief of mine is that it is better to seek fairness rather than equality, because equality is a bit of a doomed mission. Yes, all children are taught at the same level (especially with the National Curriculum), but it means that school allocation is based on postcode. **This is social segregation at its worst, even worse than selection based on one single exam.** Even with more free choice in choosing schools, those who live closer to a good school will have priority, and often good catchment areas come at a premium. Thus, it would be far better to have an element of meritocracy in our school system, whereby pupils are selected on performance, with perhaps considerations to parents' income and the history of the child's development. Also, it should happen when students currently choose GCSE options, at around 14/15. 

Moreover, all children are different and it seems at odds with the current emphasis on individuality that children should be taught all things, regardless of talent or skill. But what use is literary criticism to someone who wants to learn a trade? What use is trigonometry to anyone outside maths and physics students? Do you even remember it?It's why I believe in a whole reshuffle of the education system, with election of a choice rather than selection based on arbitrary examination; schools for those who want to go to university, schools for those who want to learn a trade, and schools who want vocational courses, so that no-one is unnecessarily left behind or held back.


Ultimately, the main premise against grammar schools goes back to an obsession with class. However, there are social classes in all societies; I would say that perhaps it's better than having social strata based on race. There will always be an elite; what I am for is opening it up.

Chelsea provide width by letting our backs go in attack so i feel we don't really need a traditional winger like Navas. Schurrle offers an excellent longshot, and deep runs in the box, he is also a decent defender.

true,tdeff19,1953,,"That's why I included the depth at the CB position. I'm sure Luiz/Ivanovic/Cahill can develop a strong partnership with Varane into the future. Varane is the Terry replacement I had in mind. Not trying to have Terry start week in and week out by any means.

It seems to me a lot of people are writing off our midfield as garbage. Yes Essien isn't the player he once was, Romeu's development has stalled, and McEachran can't get a sniff at the first team. But this double pivot isn't supposed to look pretty with world class names. Ramires is quality, Lampard can still provide, Oscar can move to his national team role in the squad, and Luiz can adjust to a solid defensive midfield role. We're not looking for a Busquets, or a Schweinsteiger or someone else who is unrealistic. We're just looking for players who can provide for the attacking front and do the job required. I have faith that the current crop in the club can handle those roles. 

I can see Marin being offloaded if the rumors are true that Khedira/DeRossi/Fellaini are inbound. But that's the only way I see a new midfielder coming in. Mikel is vastly underrated at what he does and Ramires is the kind of ""jack-of-all-trades"" midfielder I can see adapting to a new role in the club. He can be refined into what the squad needs him to be and probably won't complain one bit. 

As for the Torres conundrum, I'd look for Mourinho to see if he can get him scoring again, much like Benitez did during his short time here. If you have questions about Torres, then you'll surely have questions of Ba or Lukaku leading the line as well who are already at the club. There's a much better chance to evaluate for a half a season and make a necessary signing in January. Falcao is out of the equation, Napoli have repeatedly laughed off our interest in Cavani, City would charge a premium for Dzeko, and Lewandowski looks more and more Bayern bound by the day.

However, I don't think it's necessary,  he would be perfect as the defensive midfielder of a 4-3-3.

Why should we have Luiz adjust to a new role when he's by far our best defender and at best a mediocre defensive midfielder? I'm not saying we need to sign a new midfielder, I'm saying the midfield you've chosen isn't that good. Mikel's far better in defensive midfield than Luiz and Lampard isn't the player he used to be and shouldn't be starting for us over Ramires who is the typical box to box midfielder the jack of all trades with loads of pace and stamina.

I don't really think there is a ""Torres conundrum."" He's not good enough to start for us, a few goals in the Europa League and one premiership goal this calender year doesn't change that.

Then again, 10 seems like he can have fun no matter what the situation, though most of the time he remains serious if the situation calls for it. 

I, for one, liked Rose, though I can understand people's disdain for her. To me, Martha was a good companion, but I didn't like some of the episodes with her. Mainly because most of them were too formulaic: She goes off on her own, which I liked, but she would get captured alongside someone else, who would give up and whimper about how hopeless everything is and Martha would be all ""Don't worry, the Doctor will save us"" and then he would at the last second.

Additionally, it presents a better picture of the Doctor at work and the lengths to which the Doctor will go than either the 11th Hour or Blink. 


What makes the 11th Hour a poor choice in my mind is that it was really more of an introduction of 11. Looking back at DW on a whole,  the first few ep's with a new Doctor really aren't the best or strongest for the series or for that particular Doctor. In some cases, they seem designed specifically to clutch onto as large a segment of an audience that may step away from the franchise when the iteration of the Doctor they have come to love is replaced. 


As for Blink, I really think it's just a lousy episode. I think the Angels are essentially foes with very lazily conceived mechanics which put them solidly in the cart of things I'd like to see hauled away.

As for a new Doctor, I agree. I didn't like how childish the 11th was, even if it was funny on occasion. I'm American and not too fond with a ton of English actors, but somebody in their late 30's or so, who lets a joke slip every once and a while, but takes things pretty seriously, and is pretty adventurous- oh, we found Daleks? It'll be hard to beat them but I can do it- a more positive attitude without the silliness would be appreciated. 
Also, I really don't want a girl Doctor. I just think it would be weird. I make the jokes a lot but it would be a weird twist to the show. I think that maybe eventually it should happen, but not now. Maybe wait a few regenerations. If that would add in more guy companions, that would be neat though, because the Doctor has (understandably) had many female companions. Another thing is that they bring post library River back, it would be weird. (Still didnt like that whole marraige thing.)
