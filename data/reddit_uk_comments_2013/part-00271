true,maybelying,null,null,"&gt; To me, the 50th was the bridge between old-Who and new-Who

I don't disagree there was an element of that with Night of the Doctor, which bridged 8 to war doc and beyond, but that was more of a shout out to the fanbase.  The transition from 8 to war doc was a web video, not part of the actual episode and wasn't a critical part of the story.  The 50th was a continuation of the story of Eleven and was the culmination of the rebooted series as the Doctor dealt with the implications of what happened during the time war.

&gt;and was supposed to explore or explain at least some of the Time War.

But who set this expectation?  You did.  Moffat didn't.  We all speculated about what the 50th was going to encompass, mostly because of a throw-away line from Ten in EoT about all of the horrors of the time war, but in the end Moffat was setting it up to bridge Eleven to Twelve.  Plus a lot of fan shoutouts to boot.  The rebooted series has been about the Doctor dealing with the consequences of his actions during the time war, the 50th puts a bow on it and sets the stage for the introduction twelve, where the new emphasis will be the redemption of Gallifrey instead of the Doctor.  

&gt;I've been watching since the Tom Baker era. I love those old episodes with their bad effects and cheesy synth music. I just wasn't impressed with the 50th like I have been with several other episodes of new-Who

Ditto. I actually started somewhat during the John Pertwee run, but it was Tom Baker that will always be the Doctor to me.  Sure, it was cheesy, but the production never got in the way of the story.  My imagination did a much better job of filling out the story than the producers ever could have.

FWIW, I wasn't overly impressed with the 50th either, but I'm mostly disappointed that they tried to cram it into a single episode.

Not really - Well at least in my head anyway.  Leather is a bi-product of beef so it makes sense if you don't use beef, that you also avoid leather and other ""beef"" products (glue?).   I myself don't eat fish so tend to avoid wearing fish products when ever I can.  Mind you there is also the argument that as a bi-product you might as well use it anyway.

TBH its like the whole fur argument.  I can think of very few cases (well non but I'm sure I'm wrong) where fur preforms better than a man made fabric.  If you wear fur, to me your making a statement that you are either so poor you have to make your clothes out of what ever you can find or you like other people to torture cute animals on your behalf and then brag about it.

Learn the songs. If nothing else, Marching on Together is always the loudest chant in the stadium, whoever we are playing. Leeds away fans are the best and loudest in the land. You need to contribute to that.

I can confirm this as parents scramble to try to find a school that has less than a 30 pupils to one teacher ratio, and doesn't have major problems with underfunding, and discipline problems. Basically the Government thought they could shirk their responsibilities and give their buddies in business a nice backhander to take over schools, and start new schools at the taxpayers expense.

I definitely think we should do our best to keep him (although definitely loan him as long as Lampard is here), his best position is the one Oscar is playing right now. I (personally) think Mourinho will find KDB is a lot more suited as Oscar's back-up/rotation-option than Mata, who eventually will become a regular on the right.

Besides, if we are chasing, having KDB play as an 8 next to Oscar in front of a defensive midfielder should be every Chelsea fan's wet dream.

It's particularly galling to see an English Prime Minister blithely dismiss the concerns of the Loyalists at a speech in Dublin because he knows his audience, and he knows how well that would have played. He's essentially abdicating the British establishment's role in creating the conflict, and allowing the Loyalists to be the scapegoats and whipping boys for any residual and justified resentment on the nationalist side.

The Loyalists themselves need to wake the fuck up and understand that the trinkets and baubles of culture they were given, namely the flags and right to march, were nothing more than a sop, because coming from a working class Loyalist background, believe me, most of them had it just as bad as the nationalists but they foolishly thought they were better off.

The problem we have at the moment is that everyone in the peace process is a winner, except the Loyalists, they still have no jobs, their kids are the least likely to go to university, the industries they used to think they could rely on are all gone, and the few trappings they had, namely the flag and right to march, have been taken from them.

nobody will respond to this petition, even if you got enough sigs. Since it still needs to be presented to the house of commons.

http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/have-your-say/petitioning/public-petitions/

Have you checked how you get all of the petition off the website to print it? Is there a fee?

whereas the goverment online petitions, are meant to automatically get debated once they reach 100,000 signatures,  without us relying on that the petition creator can be bothered printing it off, and getting it into the house of commons. 

These websites are always shams, set up to collect your email adresses, and sometimes to charge you money to actually use the petition.

The reason broadband is so cheap is that all ISPs share bandwidth between customers. It's an inherent property of a network that most users won't run their connection at 100% capacity for very long, so an ISP only has to supply enough bandwidth (usually at a 20:1 or 50:1 ratio) so that most of the time, anyone who does use their connection at 100% will get 100%.

Each cell site has a limited number of channels and a limited amount of bandwidth.

Whilst they're not quite 'hot, single girls in your area want to fuck now', if you're not actively hideous and inarticulate, they do sort of work as a way to get laid, or at least, up your chances of doing so.

Compared to meeting people in social places like pubs or clubs etc, they're a way to get past the questions of whether someone's single, looking, and what they're basically like. Not getting a reply to a message, or a polite 'no thanks' is also a lot less bothersome than getting turned down or blown out when you approach someone directly, or try to turn a crush on a friend into something else.

I am not the world's most attractive man - maybe a solid 5 - but I've punched way above my weight, as it were, in terms of going out with some very attractive women I've met online dating. It *might* help that despite being awkward and shy when talking to people in person at first, it's easier to build up rapport via messages and actually be more genuine, so that a lot of things are out of the way before actually meeting up with someone. I have no idea if that's typical but I've found that not being an arsehole, or pushy, plus being a bit amusing and articulate, plus having a few shared interests can cancel out what you might perceive as a mismatch in terms of physical attractiveness. 

The time when they *don't* work, I've found, is when I'm skint and stressed and looking for distraction. That means it's harder to arrange to meet up and go out, and things on your mind make you seem like you don't care or aren't interested in someone.

But it's not *necessarily* a bad thing, because if Virgin Media weren't going to operate in this way they wouldn't suddenly double the capacity of their network toi offer 125Mbit/s all of the time, instead they'd just offer 50Mbit/s as their max speed.

Our school was days from being bankrupt, as the most active parents children had left leaving only one person on the board, unfortunately the person left on the board was totally incapable of handling the responsibility that comes with running, what is in effect, a fairly large company (for free). Teachers started to leave and we were waking up for work not knowing if there would be a school to go to that day or not, which is not a nice feeling. The problem is to get by here BOTH parents have to work 100%+, you are also expected to attend many activities with your child, this doesn't leave much time for running a school properly..  then for the high schools and above, it was basically venture capital companies coming in, getting huge grants and profits then leaving after 3 years, sometimes closing 20-30 schools down leaving the local councils to pick up the pieces. Such a terrible legislation this was, no oversight at all, responsibility devolved, and the politicians that set this mess up are of course on their golden politician pensions already.

There is absolutely no doubt that a Scottish re-entry into the EU would be quick and easy, and special measures would probably be put into place for a simultaneous exit from the UK and re-admittance into the EU. They're currently within the EU, so by definition they meet the requirements.

The EU has a very strong incentive to keep the Scottish economy within the EU at all times so as to minimise damage to trade. They will do their best to make it as smooth as possible. The status of Scottish people as EU citizens would be very unlikely to change even as they declare independence.

However, EU treaties frequently have opt-out provisions for countries whose membership is older than the treaties themselves. Since the UK is an early member, we have some major opt-outs, especially from joining the free-travel Schengen Area and from adopting the Euro.

If Scotland declares independence as a new state that is not the successor of the UK (a title which would be retained by the United Kingdom of England, Wales and Northern Ireland), they will not have these opt outs and will be required to join the Schengen Area and will be obligated to join the Euro at some point.

Now, the Euro isn't really much of a problem. I predict Scotland will simply do a Sweden and not tie their currency, whatever it is, with the Euro. By blocking off the Eurozone accession process in this way, they will then have a de facto opt-out. So far, so good.

The big one is Schengen. They will have to join the passport-free travel area, which means securing external borders. This would negate the possibility of a Common Travel Area, unless the UK and Ireland agree to replace it entirely by relinquishing *their* opt-outs and joining Schengen as well, which I don't doubt they would.

Curious how the result of a single referendum that isn't about EU membership will still set off a massive domino-effect that leaves us all slightly more tightly bound to Europe.",0,1387025914,null,0,1387027202,0,ce1is58,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1is58,t3_1suzqs,null,1428137342,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,SiliconRain,uk,Briton in Scotland,"You've somewhat missed the point of the statement: because they would have to reapply, Scotland would have to conform to the treaty terms for all new member states. Specifically:

* Scotland would not be able to opt out of the single currency. To be an EU member state, an independent Scotland would be obliged to adopt the Euro, contrary to Alex Salmond's assertions that Scotland would keep the Pound.

* Scotland would not be able to opt out of the Schengen passport-free zone, meaning that anyone from Germany or Norway or Poland or any other of the 26 Shengen states would have to be able to arrive in Scotland and walk into the country without showing a passport. Because the UK is not a Shengen country, there would have to be an enforced, passport-controlled border between Scotland and England, something that the SNP have dismissed before.

Those are the sorts of distinctions that make the difference between remaining in the EU and having to reapply for membership. 

Furthermore, it's not necessarily so simple. Scotland would still have to meet the Maastricht Criteria, which dictates, for example, that no applying state can have a national debt greater than 60% of GDP. Depending on how Scotland's debt is apportioned after independence, the national debt [could easily be 75% of GDP](http://www.scotreferendum.com/questions/what-will-scotlands-share-of-national-debt-be-and-how-will-it-repay-it/). Also, applying states must not be running a budget deficit greater than 3% of GDP, whereas [Scotland ran a deficit of -5% in 2011-12](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0041/00418420.pdf).",0,1387027958,null,0,1387028465,0,ce1j3nn,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1j3nn,t1_ce1isfd,null,1428137193,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

There's not much point in enforcing the Schengen if you're not attached to another country that's already in it.  I know there's an exception with Iceland, but still.

The interesting point, for my money, is not Schengen or the Euro, which I agree seem difficult to enforce, but the issue of the UK rebate.  There's no chance of Scotland securing a slice of that pie from the EU negotiations, so effectively, ironically, Scotland will still be paying something back to the rUK.  

Whilst I hear that Scotland is less eurosceptic-proExit than the rUK, I'd love to see some more recent polls on just how pro-EU Scotland really is.

It's a strange one because Scotland seems to say that it has more in common with the North of England (or less against it) than London, is typically more left leaning than England, and particularly Nordic friendly; yet when we look the one place that is more in line with Scottish EU sentiment its London with the North being more EU-sceptical, and in Norway it's actually the left that forms the most EU-scepticism.

I understand that the SNP backs closer EU integration and that Scotland is less sceptical as a whole, but post a referendum on Scottish independence, and after losing the rebate, I'm interested in what the pro/anti EU split is going to be.

Yes, with you ignoring facts and links and deducing your own opinion from your own limited viewscope omitting anything which questions that viewpoint.

Let's rewind to the initial points we argued because we could go on forever and these replies within replies are getting harder to keep track of.

Your first reply to turn this into a full thread was:

&gt; This assumption-connection would hold up if there was a prevalence of examples of gypsies raising money for charity, making a tangible contribution to their current local area, etc. - but so far, none has been forthcoming or championed, even by well-intentioned redditors arguing in defence.

I disagree with the need for ""prevalence"" due to the low number of travellers vs non-travellers but there certainly needs to be some travellers doing good to help back up my theory and disprove your rebuttal. And for balance, if you find one hearsay story of a crime committed in your area, I'd be surprised if you couldn't find the non travellers committing the same crime on a more regular basis.

I can Google a number of traveller run charities, many are mainly rely on donations from travellers and go on to help other travellers. So they are in the grey area of whether or not these charities help local communities. As travellers are part of local communities and the welfare and school charities show self-sufficiency and refusal to rely on the state, I would argue that they do satisfy the case. Other charities do help people outside the traveller community and so definitely satisfies what we're looking for.

I just found this lovely picture on the website belonging to the school I mentioned. It was their first incarnation of the school in the 80's/90's. I'll assume the misspelling of ""school"" was deliberate and artistic rather than a painfully ironic error.

The Cheshire Gypsy and Travellers Voice run by travellers hasn't been updated for a while, but they had an event in 2011 which sounds like it would have been a great day out.

&gt; ""We will be holding a two day event at The Edge Community Centre in Winsford, Cheshire on 25th and 26th June, we will be offering the Passing Places exhibition, local family photos through the generations, traditional Ledge Wagon restoration, in addition to this we will have crafts for children, Tradional Gypsy food on offer, pony rides and we will be showcasing some of our great musicians on the Satuday night.  On the Sunday we will have our exhibitions but visitors will be able to watch the live semi finals for Travellers Got Talent Northern heat for the national competition.""

So my closing speech:

There are bad groups of travellers. There are disruptive camps which partake in illegal activities. They leave their rubbish in parks and in the street sometimes even flytipping waste to circumvent waste disposal regulations and upset local communities. There are bored traveller children who waste time in public places causing a nuisance. We waste resources and money dealing with the worst of these travellers and cleaning up after them. Some are even filthy and smell and are obnoxious and rude. You'll be hard pushed to find anyone who'll disagree with that.

but

There are bad groups of Brits. There are disruptive neighbourhoods and houses which partake in illegal activities. They leave their rubbish in parks and in the street sometimes even flytipping waste to circumvent waste disposal regulations and upset local communities. There are bored British children who waste time in public places causing a nuisance. We waste resources and money dealing with the worst of these Brits and cleaning up after them. Some are even filthy and smell and are obnoxious and rude. You'll be hard pushed to find anyone who'll disagree with that too.

There are also great people in both camps, in both camps we have people setting up [schools](http://travellersschool.org.uk), we have people feeding those [who cannot afford to eat](http://travellersaidtrust.org/), we have hubs of information for and about travellers trying to help [bridge the divide between settlers and nomads](http://gypsy-traveller.org) which is an essential service as race relations have always been a difficult point. ""They"" don't want to be friendly to ""Us"", and ""We"" don't want to be friendly to ""Them"" a cycle we can see between all races and countries and their neighbours. And I have respect for all people who go out of their way to help other fellow human beings. Any help towards traveller communities is always met with resistance from the non-travelling community. When Children in Need donated a measly £28,000 of its £18million raised that year, it made front page news! One paper reported:

On paper that should be a sizeable chunk of settled immigrants and their first generation kids who could be targeted for indoctrination into the faith. I think there will always be a struggle against Arsenal in the area though. Community outreach into Ealing, Hounslow and Hillingdon through Warren Farm might also help in the longer term as well. The new distance from Uxbridge Road is a pretty dramatic shift though, and I worry that it will kill a nice part of the club's identity that it shared with a good number of West Londoners. The new location might be (relative to Loftus Road) a pain to get to for a good few years after construction too - the extensive transport links are a long way off, and in the case of HS2 not even fully greenlit.

It will be interesting to see how the club comes out at the other end of this tunnel, should it all go according to plan. I'd rather they focus on drawing local support before attracting new fans in the Asia Pacific region. How much importance are the going to dish out between the live experience product and the televisual product? How will they balance it - if at all - as an entertainment product versus a community entity? I also don't know how much joy they will get from trying to drum up support from the global super rich who - as per Battersea - are likely to buy up any fancy apartments built in the area.

I can sympathise with the views I'm seeing expressing dismay at the club's identity being completely transformed - albeit it with a touch more respect and delicacy than we're seeing elsewhere. However I don't know how sustainable the current model is - so many fans seem to be coming to Loftus Road from so far away, on the back of historic connections to the local area. How likely are their kids to put in the same shift every Saturday? And by what factor does that diminish with the generation after that?

and competition just involved providing a shitty service for a higher price. hence why the mass fraud and speed deceptions come in.

cutting running costs is just another way of boosting prifts.
not to mention the people who lost there jobs during the privatization.

true,banksy33,num3,,"Right now judging on current performances:

1) Chiriches - has surprised everyone, I would say our second best centre half at the moment behind Jan, he's confident, quick, strong and seems to be reading the game well

2) Paulinho - while his finishing has been poor, he's skilful and good on the ball, he's shown flashes of brilliance, inconsistent yes, but on his day he's been fantastic.

3) Capoue - Whether it's been defensive midfield or centre half, hasn't had a bad game. Doesn't set the pitch alight but when he's there he gets the job done. Consistent and quietly very assured and his work rate is admirable.

4) Soldado - Should have had a few more goals but he's producing them, link up play is extremely good but his goal scoring record isn't. Lack of service is being overused as an excuse and should really be doing better. Still infinitely better than Defoe and I fail to understand why anyone would think otherwise.

5) Chadli - seems to have the fans on his back but he's the proper winger we asked for and he's quick, strong and has a good final ball. He's been far better than the fans on this subreddit have given him credit for but still he hasn't torn any teams up yet. I'd still say for £7m, a shrewd signing

6) Eriksen - his injury has hampered him slightly but still He's been very quiet apart from one extremely impressive game - his debut. He'll come good soon, and my lord he'll be good, but he hasn't been outstanding yet.

7) Lamela - poor old Lamela, it hasn't gone right for him yet. I've seen flashes of what he will become, and I genuinely think he'll come good. And when he does, like Eriksen, he'll be an incredible player for Tottenham. He just hasn't really done anything yet to warrant any other position than 7th.

In terms of potential and their contribution to Tottenham in the long term? Well then it changes. I would say the rankings would look like this:

1) Eriksen - I think he'll become one of the premier leagues brightest talents and will show his true skill and ability in the not too distant future.

2) Lamela - as discussed earlier, will come good and will do what he's done all throughout his career. We'll see the skilful goal scoring Lamela we expected to see in time.

3) Chiriches - bought in fourth choice centre half, it's hard to say Kaboul or Dawson deserve to play instead of him, and he's still young, look forward to seeing him progress.

4) Soldado - those goals will come!

5) Paulinho - will continue to improve and adapt to the premier league.

6) Capoue - will keep showing his strength and toughness in a spurs shirt, just doesn't have the raw talent of the 5 above him.

7) Chadli - a good rotation option and useful to have around, but won't display performances I expect to see of the rest on a consistent basis.


Do I see any of these signings as potential flops? Honestly no. I'm being as positive as Spurs fans always are but I think I've seen enough sparks of talent from all of them to think we genuinely spent well in the summer, and it'll take it's time for people outside the spurs community to appreciate that, but they'll come around.",0,1387033467,null,0,false,0,ce1k7v6,t3_1stiig,t1_ce1k7v6,t3_1stiig,null,1428136672,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

It's self-evident that the upper echelons of dissident Republicanism aren't completely incompetent - they have the skills to acquire weapons, explosives, engage in cronyism, apply political pressure, operate an organised crime syndicate, evade prosecution etc. Scumbags, yes, but not idiots.

These attacks however don't make sense. They lack incentive and drive. They're too lazy and half-baked and non-committal, almost as if they wanted them to fail. So why carry them out? Blind sectarianism doesn't really fit the bill, it's too simple; it doesn't fit with their selfishness - too much effort for too little reward. To kill 'enemy combatants'? A few children going to see a play in the MAC and a couple of diners don't seem like key political targets. A united Ireland? Even they are not so naively optimistic as to think that'll happen anytime in the near future.

The only reason I can see, the only logical explanation for why these people would want to bomb a restaurant at Christmas and put innocent lives at risk, is pure and simple media attention. To cause enough chaos to make themselves relevant again. To return to their 'glory days'. Because they're done. They're spent. They're not wanted. They're the washed out X-Factor 'celebrity' from yesteryear that'll turn up at weddings for a tenner or appear on Celebrity-Something in a desperate attempt to stay in the spotlight.

Panti was shocking and I expect to see Hart back in for Fulham.  Defence was rubbish again and had no answer to their through balls.  To be honest, Giroud was absolutely excellent today and his performance will be underrated if you weren't watching him live.  His off the ball movement just constantly confused Demi and Kompany all day and he's a player who I seem to think plays well every time I watch him.

Nasri had a phenomenal game and he was deseperate to score, he'll be disappointed that he didn't but he put in his best shift in a blue shirt today.  

Fernandino and Yaya totally dominated their midfield and showed Arsenal how overrated their ""world class midfield"" is.  Apparently Ozil played today as well but I can't confirm this.

Aguero and Negredo is the best striker partnership that City have had in a good 50 years.  The understanding between these two and the symmetry in their play is frightening at times.

Another wonderful game from Merlin and he's getting back to 90 minute fitness.  We're a different team with him in it.

We pressed the entire game, the energy levels of our players at the moment is superb and our ability to rotate our squad midweek really paid off today whereas Arsenal's player looked knackered after an hour.

Arsenal fans wanted a penalty from Zab but it was never a penalty, it hit his knee then his armpit.

Good atmosphere today but it always is when the cocky cockney cunts come here.

Yaya got booed from the crowd for not giving the ball to Ferdi for his hattrick, and I thought it was harsh but as I say about hypercompetitiveness of professionals, it will happen.  Ferdi didn't seem to mind too much.

Zabaleta is currently the best right back in the world.  I mean that aswell, he is criminally underrated.  He had one of those performances today where you can show kids.

As a rider you are certainly not one and likely not both, you're probably on normal road tyres and you're not riding a trailie, so try to avoid anything where there's ice.

When it's really cold and you see run-off from verges crossing the road, cross it upright.  If you're going in a straight line and you apply no inputs the bike will continue going straight at a more-or-less constant speed, as that's its natural state (at least until it stops).

So be as smooth as you can, keep it as upright as you can if you're unsure and make sure your tyres are a decent brand and in good condition and the correct pressure.  If you see anything that looks dodgy, cross it whilst upright.

true,Kireas,english,Surrey,"I work in programming and networking so this isn't complex to me.

**Case Study**

Both Virgin Media here in the UK and...I don't know, lets take Elion as an example over in Estonia...offer a 100mbps line.

Now, both of these lines are advertised as ""up to 100mbps"". The piece from the Estonian advertising is 

&gt; Laiendame iga päevaga oma kiire interneti leviala - toome kodudesse kuni 100 Mbit/s kiirusega ühenduse ja tulevikuteenused.

The key bit there being ""toome kuni 100 Mbit/s"" - ""Up to 100 mbit/s"".

**So what does this mean?**

It means that the maximum speed you can reach on either of these lines is around 100mbit/s. However, you are not on a dedicated link - dedicated links are expensive, thousand-pound-per-month connections which only you can use (I had to give a presentation explaining them just last week!). What you have is a shared connection.

Here is a little diagram I quickly drew up in MSPaint for you:

http://i.imgur.com/18kAaZ8.png

Now in this example, I've assigned the total bandwidth for the local hub as 500mbps. This is just a number I'm using for this study, but the principles are sound.

As you can see, your house is connected to a local hub, as are all the other houses nearby. At any given point, only a few of these houses will be using the connection, therefore you have access to your full 100mbps.

However, were all 6 of the houses shown here to max out their connections, each house would would only get a max of 83mbps rather than their allotted 100. This is a contended connection.

This is the same model for all ISP's world wide.

**Why did it not affect me in Estonia?**

There are a few reasons, the mostly likely one is that it did, but you simply didn't notice. A temporary speed drop of 10 meg out of 80 or so isn't something you'll catch onto. However, I'll believe you when you say it didn't.

Another key is the population of Estonia.

The total population of Estonia as of the end of 2012 was a little over **1.3 million.**

The total population of the UK as of the same time period was **63 million.**

That's roughly 60 times the population, in a space only 5 times larger. (The UK is a little under 250,000km^2, Estonia is a little over 45,000km^2).

As you can see, contention of connections is going to be a much greater issue in the much more densely populated cities of the UK.

**Conclusion**

While the ISP's in the UK could stand to upgrade their infrastructures somewhat, connection contention is a real issue that affects all ISP's around the world. ""Guaranteed connections"" are not a consumer level product, and while some ISP's and locations will have more consistent speeds than others, that doesn't negate the very real technical limitations.

The solutions to the problem are to upgrade the network infrastructure - something already underway - or offer all around lower speeds, which will reduce the contention.

or a box of sweet only to find there's two sweets in the bottom.

or a small amount of larger in your pint glass. 

Im sure that would complain to the bar staff?

if you order 100 planks of wood and only received 5, would you say its ok, because the lorry was too small?

Im starting to see why we all get ripped of in this country, its because no body does anything about it.

 and the Maastricht Treaty - which created the European Union itself - was signed by John Major, despite his own party almost bringing down the government over it.

What it wants to do is remain part of the EU, but keep the pound. Its been made very clear that under current EU rules, it would leave the EU, have to reapply, most likely be forced to take the Euro, and would require the approval of all EU nations (including Spain, which Madrid has hinted it wont give) to complete the process.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"You need to learn a little more history. The French Empire, for example, was only marginally smaller than the British Empire. And far more brutal. But don't let facts prevent you from indulging the liberal fascist guilt-trip that seems so popular these days.

Between 1933 and 1945 the Germans also had a pretty good crack of the whip in trying to create a greater European Empire (a bit like Napoleon but with tanks and stukas). Maybe that just slipped your mind. As has the Soviet Empire of circa 1945 to 1991.

You're quite right in one respect though. The Italians weren't as good as us at Empire building. Well… not the second time around at least.

Sticking with World Wars briefly, ever heard of the Austro-Hungarian Empire? The way you're going, I'd be surprised if you've heard of the First World War, which was a war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was very keen on indeed.

And I suppose the natives of Central and South America invited Spain and Portugal into their lands and freely gave them all that lovely gold that made Spain the most powerful military force in Europe (and therefor the world).

And don't mention your views to the Dutch, either. They might be very offended at you for denigrating the size of theirs.

I suspect the Chinese harbour a far greater grudge against the Japanese for their behaviour at Nanking than they do against the British.

And while we're on the subject of China, have you heard of Tibet? Or Chairman Mao? You know, the guy who's bright ideas lead to the deaths of between 40 and 70 million Chinese.

The Ottoman (Turkish) Empire certainly seems to have slipped your attention completely. Or maybe you just didn't think it was big enough, or brutal enough to mention. But it was big, it was brutal (ask your average Greek how much they love the Turkish) and it lasted between 1299 and 1923. Personally I don't think it an insignificant Empire. But then mentioning it does support my point-of-view rather more than it does yours.

Muslim Arabs didn't do too badly with the Moorish Empire, either. It stretched from the Middle East to Spain, and included places like Sicily. Again, are you unaware of its existence, or does it inconvenience your political view a little too much?

And far be it for me to point out to you that many of our former colonies actively choose to retain the Queen as their head of state, and participate in the British Commonwealth (which you might be interested to learn has a population of 2.2 billion people). Such hatred.

As for India, Pakistan and Bangladesh? Well their hatred of Britain is so profound that they chose to migrate to the UK in their tens of thousands. And many of them still do choose to do so. In fact, the biggest issue Indians seem to have with England usually involves a game of cricket between our two nations.

Ironically, we probably did more to piss off Pakistan when New Labour decided to fake an intelligence report and invade Iraq than we ever did during the Empire.

The 'negotiation period' allows for a stable transition, which is in the interest of everyone. Trade, movement of people, legal rights, ect, would be best suited to be worked out prior to the independence day, ideally with EU membership from day 1. If you imagine all the Scottish citizens abroad, and EU citizens here, would it not be best to make sure that they aren't in a legal purgatory where they don't know whether they can continue working? One example of many.

As for the Euro, Scotland would have to meet [ERMII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERMII) for 2 years, and would require a currency transition (UK pound &gt; independent scots currency). Currently there are no entry conditions, or treaty obligations, under which the EU can force a member state to meet ERMII, and this is how Sweden has so far stayed out of the Euro. I think that Scotland may well have to pledge that it would eventually join the Euro, but even the transition of pound &gt; independent scots currency would take years.",0,1387036888,null,0,false,0,ce1l4zv,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1l4zv,t1_ce1kphz,null,1428136242,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Just knock down Hadrian's wall and put in a chain-link fence. No problems, mate!

Will they have to join Schengen? I've wondered about this exact same issue as well. I'm an Australian citizen with a visa to work in the UK. I was thinking about working in Scotland. 

If Scotland left the UK, and joined the EU, I'd be in a really weird position as I can't work in the EU!

At the moment I get questioned and finger printed at each entry point to the UK (biometric visa). Would the same happen each time I travelled between Scotland and England, I wonder? 

I think Schengen wouldn't be necessary as it's technically possible to guard that border, but I doubt they'd be expected to.

Scotland wouldn't care about people travelling to England, but I'm sure England wouldn't be happy having Scotland as an easy entry point to England.

The devil is always in the details.

You have to pay the HMRC import duty to get your parcel, the ParcelFarce handling fee you don't have to pay to get your parcel.

If you head down to pick it up, just request that you only want to pay for the HMRC import duty and NOT the handling fee. They have to release the parcel once you've paid the duty, as for their fee they can send you an invoice but I guarantee after a letter in the post you won't hear from them again.

If the HMRC fee was too high you'll have to appeal it, but I would imagine that's only after you've paid.

As for who to complain to, I don't really know. I filed a FOI request a few years back about the fees and their figures are complete bullshit. They claimed that all the admin work paying for the import duty didn't make them a single penny despite the quite high handling fee.

The law states that they're allowed to charge a reasonable amount but they take the piss.

Well there's the oil for a start, a fair bit of the EU capacity, and apparently there's more on the West Coast that can be accessed if Trident is moved.

Plus there's the chance for Scotland to act as an intermediary between the EU and the Scandinavian countries. The EU is keen to bring them in, but so far they have been cool on the idea. However, there does seem to be the potential for very close relations between Scotland and the Scandinavian countries. If it where granted membership of the Nordic Council the EU could use it as a channel for it's influence. On the other hand, it could also mean that Scotland could be part of a voting bloc within the EU with other Nordic Council members (Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Baltic states.)

If you say something's broken and it turns out it's fine everyone forgets your warnings as we are all too busy earning more money and enjoying ourselves. If you say something's broken and it turns out to be then you are hailed as a genius. What's the old phrase, economists have correctly predicted 11 of the last 5 recessions? I remember when the 2008 recession was supposed to be a depression leading to hyper-inflation. It was pretty bad, but it was no depression.

Anyway, to the question at hand. I'd say the UK is still majorly unbalanced and still far to skewed towards housing. Everyone knows this but re-balancing is hard and we probably need a small housing boom to bring back some momentum. I think it's probably the best place to be in Europe right now though. France is sluggish and I think Germany is going to have a hard time trying to micro-manage the Eurozone while crippling it with excessive exports (yes, we all want to export but Germany seems to think all countries having a net-export is somehow viable)

I'd say in 2015 the biggest thing is keeping Italy and Spain above water, and I think they will. Greece is important but... really, it's small. If worst comes to worst it's not crazy-money to bail them out again.

Scottish Independence would piss off any country with a strong nationalist movement, includign countrys that are potential future members. Spain will especially be angry, probably to a degree where they will attempt toblock Scottish re-entry. The UK might even oppose it.

With even minimal opposition Scotland will suddenly lose it's barganing position (I'm not sure why you think the Scottish economy is so important to the EU, it is important but not indespensible and England's financial sector is far more importnat) so then will find it almost imposisble to retain all the special allowances the UK has. 

Adopting the Euro might not be avoidable as there would almost certainly be heavy pressure to adopt it. Something that Scotland alone is more susceptible to than the UK. And we all know that becoming more econmically tied to the Euro is not a brilliant move.

Are you willing to pay more for your contract in order for the mobile suppliers to be able to install more bases and masts to enable everyone to have an equal connection? 

if so then expect tiered tarifs to come in, with people using lower speeds getting the service cheaper than those who want full speed.


&gt;it would be different if you bought a water service that only gives you a trickle of water.

This actually happens you know, when a single pipe supplying the water to multiple people is 'over-utilised'... Imagine a tower flat of 100 People, everyone running the taps and flushing their toilets at the same time. Water companies get round this by increasing water pressure on the mains, Telcos can't do this, 1gig pipes are 1gig pipes..

&gt;or a box of sweet only to find there's two sweets in the bottom.

Again if everyone was eating from the same limited box this would happen

&gt;or a small amount of larger in your pint glass.

Again, if everyone was drinking from the same glass in unequal sized mouthfuls..

of course, but a pint is a pint for me, not a pint for 100 people in the pub....

Seriously though, what a game of two halves that was. I hardly recognised us in the first half. Long balls and poor possession play throughout - pretty much the opposite of what we've been all about so far in the season. 

Then on the other side of the half it didn't take long for the roles to reverse. Suddenly it was Blackpool who were hoofing the ball at every occasion, and it was left up to us to attack and pile the pressure on. The first goal was massively flukey but big props to Austin for chasing the GK and forcing the error. Second goal was sheer clinical beauty.

2-0 away at Blackpool is a huge win for us. Being able to get three points from a tough mid-December away fixture in the pouring rain in spite of a bad start is a very good sign. The sign of a winning mentality. We'll need more of it in the near future.

I also think Carroll is getting better and better. He had some really nice passes today. If the quality of his passes start to match the quality of his vision he'll be a real asset very soon. It was also great to see Onuoha back on the pitch. It's so conspicious how he and BAE are a different class than the opposition. Benny handled his flank with such ease throughout.

The Doncaster and Blackburn games were disappointing, and unfortunately we have only difficult fixtures coming up. But beginning on this run of four hard games we've got exactly the start we needed, and in getting it, we showed the pragmatism and determination that hopefully will see us take points against Leicester, Nottingham and Watford.

I honestly think he's one of our most intelligent and talented players, turning inside so easily and bringing the rest of the midfield or Lukaku into the game, and if not creating space for Oviedo or Baines to bomb into. People talk about the Baines-Pienaar partnership being lethal, but if you put most reasonable at attacking fullbacks behind Pienaar they'd be effective. Obviously he makes mistakes, but playing in the role he does I feel that's inevitable. His defensive abilities come down to more than just putting in a shift as well, he makes a fair few interceptions himself. Backup to Pienaar however on that flank would be valuable.

In January, a striker is usually mentioned as the key place to strengthen and I'd agree with that. A central midfielder is next most important I'd say.

You can't just pigeonhole millions of people with the tagline of ""superficial idea's"" because you don't like there opinion. Debate and discourse does not work like that..

here's some reasons why we should leave. 

1) Since we joined in 1973 we have been in surplus with every continent in the world except Europe. Over those 27 years, we have run a trade deficit with the other member states that averages out at £30 million per day.

2)On the European Commission’s own figures, the annual costs of EU regulation outweigh the advantages of the single market by €600 to €180 billion.

3)The Common Agricultural Policy costs every family £1200 a year in higher food bills.

4Outside the EU, we would be free to negotiate much more liberal trade agreements with third countries than is possible under the Common External Tariff.

It's a bloated bureaucratic monster at best, a dangerous Utopian project at worst, and whatever you think of it, Germany is ultimately in control of it, i don't want any part of that

Most people who are for leaving the EU *do*, in my view, have a superficial understanding of it, and just bolstered by nonsense the DM and other rags churn out about the 'damages' that the EU is doing to us. They have this view because they don't really understand the myriad of benefits EU membership provides, and if they were really shown these I'm willing to bet most would reconsider that decision, or at least be more unsure about it.

Even if I believe you at your word on those figures, those are just a few reasons against it, but there are more to support it. For instance many actually see free migration within the EU as a good thing, there are jobs that need to be filled and either people aren't taking them or the demand is greater than that the UK can supply on their own. For instance did you know that almost a third of UK doctors are foreign-trained?

It's easy to make broad statements about how much regulation costs, but how do you quantify the benefits? It's not just in pounds. The fact that it is easy for businesses to purchase goods from within the EU and sell within the EU without the tax/export burden has undoubtably been able to keep many businesses afloat. Now you try getting a business to survive on UK sales alone.

What's the point in negotiating separate agreements with a bunch of different countries, which is a bureaucratic nightmare in and of itself, when being part of the EU already provides us that benefit? What do you want to negotiate?

Nonsense like Germany being in control and taking over or whatever the hell you seem to be getting at is precisely the problem at play here. The EU is not perfect by any means but lets not forget that the UK government aren't angels either and being part of the EU has provided us with plenty of benefit in terms of oversight of legislation that would have extended the powers of big brother and clamped down on your rights. Not every benefit can be summed up into a nice number of how much money we can save by leaving the EU.

I don't think they'd disappear, I just think that the quality of discussion from the opposition (that is pro-EU) would drastically rise enough to disseminate real information about the other side of the argument rather than whatever drivel the DM can come up with.

UKIP's popularity has increased, though I personally feel that's also because of increased dissatisfaction with the main parties. For the same reason LibDems popularity increased around the time of the last general election because they were seen as an alternative to the two big groups who were doing fuck all. Now that Clegg has royally fucked up their time in Whitehall, it's safe to say that people are looking for yet another group aside from the usual to choose from.

But UKIP will at most just get the same shitty deal as the LibDems did, get a coalition and bend over backwards for the guys in charge. They'd never be able to do anything of real merit that their party campaigns for which either the tories or labour would agree to. The same position Clegg was put in.

I don't think anti-EU sentiments will disappear either, but I think we'll start to hear some more legitimate arguments being made, including real talk about the upsides. I think what the AV referendum did show is that people are afraid of change, and that's something minor in comparison to the effects of leaving the EU.

true,BettySw0ll0cks,UnionFlag,London - Honda VFR800,"Honestly, more than once I've been given a sharp reminder of the road conditions. Having a wheel suddenly lose traction is a quick way to drop trow - as the first comment suggested keep clear of the anchors and try and allow the bike to regain traction naturally.

I also find that holding firmly on to the tank with your thighs gives you a lot more confidence when the bike struggles for traction. Generally you should have a firm grip on the tank regardless and minimal input on the bars.

In my opinion ABS is a god send. On my previous bike the back wheel would lock up (bad conditions, overshooting, emergency stop etc) - the time I took to disengage and reengage ultimately cost me the bike.  When I picked up my latest bike (VFR), I've had to jam the anchors on for an emergency stop and you feel the ABS engage - christ you come to a halt quickly - nothing my previous bike could.

When I was younger I used to have to ride a 125 25 miles to college every day in all types of weather. Amazingly I only had one off in the ice (thankfully very tame - rode off). In my experience, keep an eye out for low lying fog in the distance and shimmering on the road. Keep well clear of country roads with leaves and mud - nightmare.

If you do get caught out in one of these situations, keep a reasonable speed (don't go overly slow as the bike will start squirming and becoming unstable) and try and head for the main roads.

Osman seems to get all the praise from commentators but other than his goal, he was on the whole poor today in bringing Lukaku into play and setting up the attack. Hopefully Barkley will take his place next week, and this will ease the attacking burden that we placed on Pienaar today, even though he was immense. 

Another solid performance defensively again, Jags and Distin didn't give up any clear cut chances and overall broke up Fulham's attack very well. The period in which we sat back and couldn't string passes together was stressful, but the two of them were resolute while our mids kind of disappeared. I think that Coleman is getting better every game. You could see the confidence he has going forward, dribbling past defenders and charging forward as often as he can. His goal was a good reward for the attacking threat he poses and he easily could have had 2 with his chance in the first half. 

I'm glad we are able to grind out results like this even when we were not at our best for a large portion of the match, credit to the team for throwing it all at Fulham to get the win in the end.

Amazing point. 

Confidence is huge, even when we are not playing well- and even though Fulham applied pressure, we managed to keep at it and still form cohesive attacks. Under Moyes I feel we would have tried to absorb pressure and play counterattacking football, and probably lost the game.

Last season there were a number of games when the postmatch rhetoric was 'we are going to pay for that lapse in European places' and how true that was.

Secondly, there is an issue with old people not wanting to make a fuss. Help may well be available, but the person won't ask for it and in some cases will flatly refuse. It is very hard to help people who won't ask or won't accept.

Not as such, Norway and Iceland  are not in the EU, Sweden is *barely* in the EU, see how they have not taken up the Euro.

&gt;But then what political bargaining power does Scotland have with Norway?

Solidarity. We are two very similar countries, with similar reliance upon the North Sea, it's fish and it's oil. It only makes strategic sense to aid each other as much as possible, as it would be beneficial for all parties. What helps Norway would very likely help Scotland too.

&gt;If they had something to offer, they would go to Norway direct.

Well that's the problem really, they don't. Norway shows very little interest in joining the EU. However, if Scotland was in the EU and had warm relations with the Nordic countries then the EU could use Scotland to, at the very least, persuade them not to do anything that would be detrimental to the EU.

&gt;not a bargaining chip.

Well done, it's not. It's a reason why Scotland and the Nordics empathise and like each other, resulting in it being more likely for them to work together.

After independence the Scottish Government would have to offer all kinds of incentives to bring in investment and build an independent financial sector. That means low debt and deficit (austerity), low corporate and wealth taxes, low environmental standards and cheapened democracy. Scotland is a small country with a small economy that will have to bend over backwards to neo-liberalism. It would not surprise me if Scotland went the way of Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Bloc.

If Salmond gets his way, and Scotland enters monetary union with rUK, then the Bank of England will have greater power over Scotland. At least now, Scottish MPs have the chance to vote on the UK's monetary policy. If Scotland walks out, it will be subject to policy without having even a formal say in decision-making. Scotland could be in the same position as Greece.

Independence splits the British working class into two camps, that will be driven towards antagonism. How long after independence will we see healdines; ""Jobs Go To England"" or ""Businesses Relocate South of the Border"", and we hear people say ""they took our jobs""?

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"No, I think maybe you are misinterpreting that statistic. UK medical schools simply do not push out enough students to cover the medical care this country needs. That's not an excuse for the government to cut medical training, and they haven't. Medical schools haven't reduced the number of students they're accepting, in fact over the years that has only increased, especially with the creation of newer medical schools like Peninsula.

But it still isn't enough, especially since medical education is so fucking expensive, it's not possible to increase the number of medical graduates enough to sustain the numbers of doctors we need. This shortage can be made up by using foreign trained doctors, so I don't see how that's a bad thing.

As we move increasingly towards a primary care model of medicine, the limitations of numbers of GPs with respect to the population will only become a bigger problem. In helping to ensure reasonable access to medical services and keeping this country healthy and afloat, I much rather use doctors from abroad than reject them altogether because people don't like the idea of foreigner.

They are NOT stealing any UK medical graduate's jobs. Acceptance into foundation places is near 100%, and in the areas where it isn't, it tends to be because a student aspired to place into a competitive foundation school, where they were beaten by other candidates, and because they didn't rank enough foundation schools and/or rejected working elsewhere they can be left without an F1 spot. But these people are few and far between and emphasis has been made to ensure that students rank their preferences for foundation schools appropriately in order to gain a job.

Besides, most foreign doctors come over here with specialist training, and are not directly competing with fresh UK medical graduates to begin with. Once you're on the training ladder, either in foundation school or specialty training, you are well taken care of, and unless you want to work in London or have a very particular (sub)-speciality, you are hardly going to have your job taken by loads of foreigners because the government want  to cut spending on medical education.",0,1387048887,null,0,false,0,ce1p6n4,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1p6n4,t1_ce1ojsp,null,1428134283,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Do you honestly think that we can't achieve our goals if we don't win this game? That is the definition of a ""must win"" game and we will still certainly be in good stead if we get a draw at WHL. Take a look at your statement, ""Every game is a must win"", and really think about how absurd that is before you start talking shit, because you really don't have a leg to stand on.

The reason I made this thread was in opposition to the other thread where everyone seems convinced of the opposite. To avoid downvotes? Do people do that?

The initial claim with HRMC requires sending the actual label in to prove it's incorrect, and if I recall correctly, I wasn't sent the label back when they sent me my cheque.  I will, of course, take several pictures this time (we took pictures last time but somehow both myself and my husband managed to lose track of the files.  Again, we had a house purchase and move happen in that time period, and we're not the only people whose lives go on whilst this long process is taking place).  

I'll certainly appeal the HMRC fee- it's incorrect, like it was last year.  We do not need to pay duty on a gift parcel under £50 or so, and I'm positive she's only marked it as 20 USD (it will only be sweets and a Lego advent calendar).  I know she's marked it clearly as a gift.

I find it very interesting that Parcelforce is actually the Royal Mail.  I did think they would be a separate company that RM had contracted to deliver parcels when they are too busy.  

If I don't get the fees back I will happily take legal action.  The entire process is outrageous though and it just seems as if there must be some kind of independent watchdog group to contact as well.

You stated that it reduces the opportunity for the native population to become doctors which I think is entirely without merit. It simply doesn't.

&gt;then there would be immense pressure on the government to radically increase the numbers of medical students.

And you think meeting that demand is as simple as popping up medical schools out of nowhere and increasing cohort size? From what money? It isn't just a matter of admitting more medical students. The entire thing is fucking expensive and when the government is making cuts to the NHS, you really think they're going to put up a shit ton of money to train more doctors (when doctors are already being subject to a pay freeze for the past few years anyway)? For medical school alone (and these figures are about 7 years out of date), the government pays £50 000 per student (from the HEFCE), plus about £125 000 per student (from the NHS) for clinical placements. Now imagine how much postgraduate education costs (which is especially long in the UK in comparison to other countries).

Look at america, there is a massive shortage of doctors there in some fields, especially general practice (particularly rural areas) and general surgery. Medical schools are limited by staff and resources, and for post-graduate training hospitals are limited by government funding and their own resources too. The US government hasn't increased the number of training spots (residencies) and it's expensive to train one specialty doctor, let alone many many more.

Yet despite this and all this being constantly spoken about within their medical community, their pressure has not been enough to force the government to do anything about it. On the other hand the shortage of doctors is only increasing, do we really want to sacrifice patient and population health/safety by playing russian roulette with the government? I'd rather ensure that people have access to good services, even if a doctor is foreign, than have no access at all.

I'm currently addicted to various coronation chicken varieties. At christmas i'm very fond of turkey and stuffing.

I'll rock up at t'mothers 'ouse on the 24th at 8pm and find out what she's doing. It'll probably be a turkey joint with those little mini sausages in bacon. Mum will have gone to Iceland for it.


&gt; What you do with your leftovers

There arent many as we dont get a full turkey in these days. Joint will still have food for a few days left over though.


&gt; What's on the telly worth watching (as I don't have one I don't see the ads, but I can stream and I'm curious)

god knows, i just grab stuff online if its decent these days.


&gt; How drunk you get and how many family arguments it has caused (add detail for my entertainment if you're brave enough)

not very - and our family mostly all get on so there's no entertaining stories!

I worked on open days this year, so was given all the information to tell prospective students. They have variable offers now, between AAB and A*AA. The offer you get is dependant on which A-Levels you're doing. And it doesn't have to be all science related, they want well rounded people. But crucially, because of the popularity in the subject, there is no leeway. If you don't get the grades, you don't get the place. 

This has definitely changed since I started, as I now wouldn't be able to get in. But I went in with ABB from a comprehensive and got a 1st class honours. 

The amount of allowance depends on the popularity of the course, how relevant the subjects are and, if applicable, the quality of interview, among other similar things I expect.

2. Christmas needs pickled walnuts for me. I've normally got a jar of them knocking about but I go mad and get a new one at Christmas. Sweet, briney goodness. Also all the cheese.

3. Anything involving extended family. they're all so bloody conservative that I can't say anything without fear of upsetting somebody, so keep schtum for the most part.

4. I fucking hate turkey, never saw the point- I saw one in Morrison's last night, barded with streaky bacon, for £55. WTAF? We're at my folks' place this year and having goose, which they bought a couple of months back and froze. I've ordered fresh/organic/yoghurt-knitting ones in the past and, whilst the dry ice in the box is all sorts of fun couldn't really justify the price. I did get a wild goose a few years back, though, which is illegal to sell. A nice man sold me a printed recipe for £22 and gave me the bird for free with it. It was fab.

5. I normally do some kind of big roast on Christmas Eve or a day or two before, and the leftovers go into sarnies or stir fries. I see that sprout tops are in fashion now (cheers Jamie) and they're just cheap wee cabbages- boil for five minutes, squeeze out the water and fry them with onion and leftover pork, or bacon if you don't have any. Fab hangover food.

6. No idea what's on, though the He-Man and She-Ra Christmas special will make an appearance at some point, along with A Nightmare before Christmas. Dead festive, me.

7. I'm usually driving so don't drink anything, but on the rare occasions we host it can get a bit, erm, *heated* when people are in the kitchen trying to help.

A report published in 2001 by the National Commission for Child Welfare and Development (NCCWD) revealed the existence of child prostitution in Pakistan, the first official admission of this violation of children’s rights in the country. According to the report, both girls and boys are victims of prostitution.

The 11-year-old girl blushed as she walked into the car dealer’s showroom on Quetta’s Adalat Road in southwest Pakistan. Her 17-year-old cousin, eyes fixed to the ground, followed her. When the younger girl asked the owner for five rupees (6 cents), he pointed to the back room and told both girls to follow him.

POVERTY INCREASES PROBLEM - Fathers often send their young daughters out on the streets to earn money for the family. The girls begin by begging – some as young as 3-years old – and as they grow older, they become part of the flourishing sex trade in this deeply conservative city in southwest Pakistan.Money is used to feed the family and on drugs for the drug addict father. 


Most of the 15,000-20,000 estimated child sex workers present in Lahore live in areas near bus stands and railway station. 

And that is just in one city, just the children excluding adults

Don't be naive. Pakistan has the death penalty or something just as appalling for adultery. Where it is heavily outlawed the exploitation is even more venal,

There was a very interesting article on BBC News online recently. I mention it because the article was about the Chinese love of all things English. To the point where one Chinese developer has recreated an entire English town, right down to red post-boxes and telephone kiosks.

Similarly, a recent article in the Spectator criticised the lack of direct flights from Britain to China. Not because the British are going to China in larger and larger numbers, but because the Chinese seem to be becoming very fond of visiting Britain.

But one person asked Cameron if he had any opium on him, so that's all the evidence of universal hatred that you need.

You'd have thought it would have fizzled out once some of the more active hardliners were caught in the act. 2013 is a completely different environment for them to be actively operating/recruiting in than 70s/80s.

What's more alarming is that quite a few of them have clean records (the two caught allegedly transporting a mortar device over the border last year, as well as the bank bombers). What's troubling is that they're recruiting from a pool with no links to PIRA, which makes them a lot harder to detect.

Conflating dissidents with PIRA is too easy and incorrect. As of yet there has been no political signalling by these new groupings. SF certainly doesn't want anything to do with them (they've got theirs, of course), and RSF are irrelevant. They have to be forced into politics and managed that way.

In terms of the Euro, Scotland would have to commit to joining the Euro. The minimum timescale for doing so is two years - since two years prior membership of ERM II is required.

There are currently ten EU members who are not in the Eurozone. Denmark and the UK have a formal opt-out, the status of the others is:

* [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria_and_the_euro). Their finance minister has stated that they will put of membership ""until after the Eurozone crisis"". As of 2013, they have not yet joined the ERM II so their two year membership of that has not yet started.
* [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_and_the_euro). The date has been deferred from 2010, to 2012, to 2015, to 2019 - on the basis of ""political reluctance"".
* [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_and_the_euro). They are keen to join, but the head of their national bank has stated that ""we have no date in mind at the moment"" (largely due to failing to meet the economic convergence criteria).
* [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania_and_the_euro). Also keen to join, also no fixed date due to economic conditions.
* [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary_and_the_euro). Originally keen to join, the Prime Minister now says that he ""does not expect the euro to be adopted in Hungary before 2020"".
* [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_and_the_euro). No target date for adoption, and no target date for joining ERM II. Interestingly, changing from the Złoty would also require a 66% majority within their Parliament (I'm unclear if this is a special case they obtained during membership, or simply part of their existing constitution).
* [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania_and_the_euro). After a series of planned dates (2013, 2014, 2015), their current proposal to the EC is without a target date. As with several others, they are not yet members of ERM II.
* [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_and_the_euro). Arguably the closest to Scotland, in that economically it probably could join if it so wished. However they too have declined to join ERM II and are under no pressure whatsoever to do so.

The Euro is obviously a long-term goal for the EU project, and over time I expect that every member (including the UK) probably will join. But, particularly in light of the Eurozone crisis, I think those timescales are now greatly extended.

In terms of Schengen, Scotland would technically be required to join. However, given that Scotland's only land border is with another non-Schengen country it would make no material difference to the rest of the EU whether Scotland received an opt-out or not. Personally I find it unlikely that this would be a sticking point in negotiations - the situation would be identical to if Scotland remained part of the UK, and the UK is under no pressure to give up its Schengen opt-out.

&gt; Those are the sorts of distinctions that make the difference between remaining in the EU and having to reapply for membership.

I think the distinction is between Scotland leaving the UK (and hence the EU) and then re-applying for EU membership, vs Scotland announcing its intention to leave the UK *at some point* while wishing to remain in the EU.

Personally I don't find it plausible to think that Scotland's membership could not be resolved within 18 months (the primary reason for delay is harmonising national law with EU legislation - a process that has already been done for Scotland), nor that Scotland would be required to exit the UK (and EU).

&gt; Furthermore, it's not necessarily so simple. Scotland would still have to meet the Maastricht Criteria, which dictates, for example, that no applying state can have a national debt greater than 60% of GDP. Depending on how Scotland's debt is apportioned after independence, the national debt could easily be 75% of GDP. Also, applying states must not be running a budget deficit greater than 3% of GDP, whereas Scotland ran a deficit of -5% in 2011-12.

There is no such thing as the ""Maastricht Criteria"". You are referring to the [Euro convergence criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria). These were introduced in the Maastricht Treaty, but they refer to membership of the Eurozone not membership of the EU.

The convergence criteria also include two years membership of ERM II. As indicated by the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/erm2/index_en.htm), membership of this is voluntary:

&gt; Participation in ERM II is voluntary although, as one of the convergence criteria for entry to the euro area, a country must participate in the mechanism without severe tensions for at least two years before it can qualify to adopt the euro.

A commitment to join the Euro is a commitment in principle - countries join when both they and the EC agree that the convergence criteria have been met.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Scotland would likely not benefit from any existing opt-outs that the UK has unless they are negotiated separately, and that's by no means guaranteed.

The UK has [three opt-outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Former_opt-outs):

* Schengen. Also granted to Ireland, and I don't see any particular reason why it wouldn't be granted to Scotland. Its only land border is with another non-Schengen country (rUK), so from the rest of the EU's POV there is no material difference if Scotland is in Schengen or not. The UK has a partial opt-out from the [AFSJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice) but this is essentially the implications of Schengen for cross-border policing.
* Euro. Also granted to Denmark, and given the political situation in the UK (there is no great demand for the Euro) I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be carried forward. If it wasn't, there is no requirement for immediate adoption. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden are all in the EU but not the Eurozone - without any formal opt-out.
* [CFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union). The UK opt-out was primarily to ensure that UK citizens could not take cases to the European Court of Justice. The [treaty itself](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) is pretty straightforward - no death penalty, no torture, intellectual property exists, innocent until proven guilty, etc.

The UK also enjoys a rebate, which is currently worth about £5bn (so say £500m to Scotland). However the rebate is based on the amount that the UK pays in to the EU relative to the amount it receives (if it pays in £100, and receives £70, it gets 2/3 the difference - or £20), has been reduced by 20%, is likely to be reduced further, and would be much less significant given that Scotland would make a smaller contribution to EU funding.

The UK's opt-outs/special treatment are things that are either unlikely to be an issue (Schengen), are not in fact an immediate requirement (Euro), or would not be not particularly significant to Scotland (CFR and rebate).",0,1387058797,null,0,false,0,ce1sqzq,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1sqzq,t1_ce1j0al,null,1428132620,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There is no real process for dismantling the EU. If Scotland's plan was to leave the UK and not participate in the EU then perhaps both parties would have to formulate one as and when the situation arose.

There's no chance of Scotland securing a slice of that pie from the EU negotiations, so effectively, ironically, Scotland will still be paying something back to the rUK.

The UK's rebate is currently worth about £5bn (so say £500m to Scotland).

However the rebate is based on the amount that the UK pays in to the EU relative to the amount it receives (if it pays in £100, and receives £70, it gets 2/3 the difference - or £20). The UK's rebate has also been reduced by 20% in recent years, and is likely to be reduced further (if not abolished entirely) in future budget negotiations.

Marketing - getting bums on seats is going to be the hardest part. Finding a free venue can be tricky enough but bums on seats is where it's at. Make sure the venue is also appropriately sized, i.e. a hall for 20,000 people isn't good if you only get 5.

A number of great ideas and comments. While i am competent in a number of topics the ones specific to my degree are environmental related (such as climate change and the many related issues, ecosystem services etc etc) and conservation (genetics etc).

I would love to do subjects in the media, one of my favourite ones would be climate change which would probably be broken into a series with specific topics in each lecture. Badge cull is another great point. On top of that i am more than capable of going over topics such as MMR related to autism which still need to be explained to many.

At the moment it's not really cold enough for ice, but the roads are greasy because of salt and mud, so be a bit cautious. Ride smoothly, and avoid braking while turning if possible.

Now on ice: there are two sorts. White ice is a bit like snow in that you can see it, so you need to be going slowly when you cross it, upright in a straight line. Staying on any gravel will help a lot. While it can be slippery, you're unlikely to come off on white ice because you will take precautions.

Black ice is white ice's evil cousin. You can't see it. It's usually in places where snow or frost has melted during the day, then re-frozen, so look for areas where there are patches of ground shaded by trees. It's very much more likely in the country than in the town (colder conditions, and more wind). If you have a commuting route, you will find out which bits are problems as it's fairly consistent in that respect. If you hit black ice, particularly when slowing for a corner, you will have several seconds of bottom-puckering terror as it decides whether to throw you today or not. In the mean time, you're trying to lose speed for the corner without locking the wheels. Nasty. The best precautions are to know the temperature, and to know where on your route black ice can appear. You do have the advantage over cars in that you can actually feel the air temperature, so watch for entering volumes of cold air.

Snow - there's different sorts. Fresh wet melting snow is generally ok as your tyres will cut through to the tarmac. Patches of compressed snow mixed with gravel are also ok. The sort of compressed snow that forms slivers a couple of inches long under car tyres rather than a solid mass is pretty evil as it will slip under your tyres. You can cross it in a straight line with caution. Deep fresh snow - depends on the temperature, but probably not a good idea. Rutted hard-frozen snow - nope.

Oddly it gets easier to ride at very low temperatures. I rode for a week in the winter of 86-87 where the in-town temperature was -16C, and out where I was living in the country it was -32. The ice wasn't slippery, and the air was dry so not as chilling as you might expect.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; What it wants to do is remain part of the EU, but keep the pound. Its been made very clear that under current EU rules, it would leave the EU, have to reapply, most likely be forced to take the Euro, and would require the approval of all EU nations (including Spain, which Madrid has hinted it wont give) to complete the process.

There are no current EU rules relating to this situation - what has been said is that if a new country was formed outside the EU, and it applied to the EU, it would be treated as a new application.

Scotland's position would be that the referendum mark the start of the independence process - it does not create independence itself overnight. As such there will be a couple of years where Scotland has stated ""we are going to leave the UK, but want to remain in the EU - how can we resolve this?"".

Given the implications for the EU itself (untangling existing funding, business, and personal links to Scotland from other EU members) it seems quite unlikely that Scotland would be told that they would have to leave in order to come back in again.

A commitment to  joining the Euro is a condition of membership, however that is a commitment in principle - not an immediate requirement. Several criteria must be fulfilled first, one of which (ERM II membership) is entirely voluntary. Currently eight EU countries are ""committed"" to joining the Euro, however several have no timetable for doing so and some have indicated they have no desire to do so either (e.g., Sweden).

Approval of all members is the current process by which new members are added. I don't think we can really speculate on if that would be the process by which the Scottish situation was resolved (clearly if they leave the UK first then it would be, but I don't think that will be the case). 

However, I also think the ""Spain veto"" is unlikely in practice. Spain is not one of the architects of the EU project, so I think you have to ask what kind of pressure they would receive in order to keep the EU together - rather than being seen as the country that helped force part of the EU out.",0,1387060655,null,0,false,0,ce1temf,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1temf,t1_ce1kphz,null,1428132313,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

However negotiations have to start somewhere, and so what you see in that document is what the SNP are proposing their approach would be. The UK government has not proposed anything at this point - even in the event of a No vote, further devolution would only be ""considered"".

There are certainly some things that will end up differently, conversely there are some things you can be quite sure about. Trident would go, there would be a written constitution, there would be a higher number of hours of paid childcare, etc.

But we have only two away wins this season and very little success against our ""big 6"" competitors in the last year. This needs to stop, we need to be biting at our desired level if we want to get back up there. It is not enough to be a club with big heart when you are LFC.

So simply enough, this is a MUST win, but only because the goal is top 4 before New Years and it is a goal before New Years because we need to go into this fricking window strong to fend off suitors for Suarez and to be able to have some further incentives for newcomers.

Spurs is a MUST win mate, the world will not end, but the the next 3 games after will be simpler with that win under our belt.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; But the EU isn't being dismantled. The UK would still be a member. Scotland is not an EU member in its own right.

The EU currently disburses Structural Funds to members like the EU, for the improvement of infrastructure in places like Wales or Scotland - that would need to stop, those funds returned (presumably), and those projects that are underway wound down.

EU businesses who had invested in Scotland, or Scottish businesses who had invested in other EU countries, would suddenly find themselves operating outside the common market - what legal status would their existing arrangements have? If an Italian company builds a factory in Scotland, using an EU grant to do so, how is that untangled?

EU citizens who were working in Scotland could in theory require visas or face deportation, as could Scots within the EU (Theresa May has intimated that Scots may [lose their British passports](http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/scottish-independence-uk-passport-loss-indication-1-2961819), making Scotland the one country that the UK does not allow dual-citizenship with). Those arrangements would need to be in place prior to departure from the UK, or would a German in Scotland suddenly become an illegal alien overnight?

Fishing fleets from several EU countries ([notably Spain](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/spanish-fish-barons-admit-taking-illegal-catches-in-uk-waters-7964246.html) fish in UK waters, courtesy of the EU. If Scotland leaves the EU, those fishing rights go too.

Clearly, if Scotland did leave the UK - and left the EU - then these issues would all need to be sorted out. And they certainly could be.

But it would be a great deal of work for no real benefit. And unless you buy into the idea that Scotland *couldn't* be in the EU, the question is really one of timing - how long would it take for Scotland to be admitted, and is the complexity of temporarily ejecting them really worth it?

East Germany (which had 16 million people and zero history of compliance with EU legislation) was added in 10 months. Croatia, an ex-communist country rife with corruption that was required to hand over war criminals and had an ongoing border dispute with an existing EU member, took 10 years.

For the sake of argument, assume that Scotland fell somewhere in the middle - let's say 5 years. I think that is wildly pessimistic, but with that kind of timescale all that would happen is that Scotland would simply wait a little longer before leaving the UK.

There would be no benefit to any party for Scotland to leave after 18 months, only to rejoin 42 months later.",0,1387063059,null,0,false,0,ce1u9c6,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1u9c6,t1_ce1tab3,null,1428131915,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then there's Amy and Rory. Rory is a nurse and he would have talked about it at some point.

A game against Spurs away from home, with injuries, and considering we're in contention in the league *is not* must win, it just isn't. It's a massive, massive game and it is *important* that we win. The argument is likely coming down to semantics I'll admit. 

&gt; 12 points in the pot before New Year, we need 8 points to maintain our 2 point average and if we want to maintain that goal (i.e. top 4 ambitions) then we MUST beat Spurs, if we Draw then we need to Beat Cardiff and City or Chelsea to get close to that goal. 

This is just a narrative you have created. It would be nice to be in the top 4 places come the new year but Champions League places are not handed out on New Years mate. Our fixtures are easier in the second half of the season (home games against the bigger teams) so being *close* to top 4 with a chance to strengthen in Jan will put us in good stead. 

Regarding Suarez, we could lose every game from now till Jan and that would make no difference to his future.

FSG know they have the best player in the league by a mile and I'd imagine are willing to give him a contract that reflects as much. Baseball salaries for the big earners are much bigger than football salaries (as far as I'm aware) and thus probably are used to spending ridiculous amounts of money on player contracts.

Finally, it gives us much more bargaining power when Real/Barca/Bayern, etc come knocking. Instead of just 2 more years on a contract, in which we'd be approaching the time to cash in, he'd have 4-5 more and any successful bid would have to be astronomical.

Lloris

Walker - Whoever the hell is fit - Danny Rose

Sandro - Dembele

Paulinho

Lennon - Soldado - Townsend

Now, I could see Eriksen getting the start *possibly* but if not I think we'd go for a very strong, physical midfield in light of Liverpool probably fielding Lucas, Allen, and Countinho.

Maybe we see Chadli start if AVB isn't sold on Townsend out wide yet. (I sure as hell am)

Obviously Suarez is our main worry, and even more so beacuse of our questionably fit group of center backs.  I'm confident that Sandro can do a job on Coutinho, but if Suarez is left free-ish to do what he does, we're fucked on that end.

However, if we do start Lennon/Townsend as our wingers, I'm confident we'll win the battle out wide.  Liverpool are also missing Jose Enrique, so Lennon will be going up against their second choice fullback.  Townsend being on the left would pin Glen Johnson back, and if Danny Rose is back I'm confident he can deal with whoever is on the right, I assume it'll be Sterling.

If we can maintain the kind of attacking play we had against Sunderland, I think we'll be fine. Soldado, in my opinion, should start.  And I think he'll bury his chances better than Defoe did.

That was a bit rambly, but here's my actual prediction, **2-2 draw.**

I'm awful at predicting scores, but I don't think we can fully contain Suarez with a half a back line, but I also think that we'll continue our run of scoring in the PL.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Not sure that I understand this. The Eurozone countries use the ECB as the central bank, their own having given up their powers. How is this relevant to Scotland using sterling?

A central bank has two primary roles: controlling the value of money by creating/destroying the number of banknotes in circulation, and (attempting) to control economic growth by setting interest rates.

The ECB provides those roles for Eurozone countries and the BoE would provide those roles for both rUK and Scotland.

I think it's quite likely the BoE would wish to [work with Scotland](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-boe-offers-currency-talks-1-3213208), rather than simply ignoring it (not out of the goodness of their heart but due to the fact that both economies would exist in parallel for some time).

But let's say they were entirely indifferent.

Scottish banks currently print banknotes under licence from the BoE after depositing an equivalent amount in sterling. In the event that this arrangement broke down then those banks would simply withdraw that sterling and replace their own notes with BoE notes. Exactly the same amount of currency would continue to exist in Scotland as before.

Country-specific central banks (such as the OeNB in Austria) do still exist in the Eurozone, however they no longer have the primary roles of controlling the money supply or managing inflation.

Instead they are more concerned with roles like managing reserve currency stores (a government may wish to hold gold or $ as well as their national currency), overseeing infrastructure like BACS/CHAPS, providing loans and mortgages, etc.

Scottish banks would continue to offer those services, using physical BoE notes if necessary, just as they do today.",0,1387066161,null,0,false,0,ce1vd7j,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce1vd7j,t1_ce1v2ok,null,1428131398,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm sure that in other situations you would actually grasp this, but in the name of hyperbole and because you have an agenda you act as if I didn't.

I've got to hand it to you, you're not terrible at propaganda. Ever considered getting into politics?

&gt;This proposal may well lead to the use of a highly controversial technique called fracking which is a new technology and still at an experimental stage in this country.

Fracking isn't new at all. Anyone who claims it is is just demonstrating ignorance or dishonesty. We've been using the technique for close to half a century, and a high proportion of all the wells made in the UK O&amp;G industry are fracked to some degree and have been for decades.

&gt;There are potential hazards involved which could have a devastating effect on the community and the environment of the surrounding area.

There are potential hazards in everything. Anyone who claims something is risk free is either lying or an idiot. All actions carry risk, and gaining and understanding of this risk and then putting in place appropriate measures to ameliorate said risk is what any sensisble regulatory agency will do. The UK has one of the best regulated oil and gas industries in the world. All forms of energy generation have the potential to cause negative effects to a community and environment, the question is, are we approaching the risks in a sensible way. So far, the UK government has taken a fairly cautious and remarkably sensible approach to hydraulic fracturing. However, instead of recognising this and giving credit but saying ""We're still a bit worried"", many environmental groups have chosen to cherry pick examples from the US (where regulation is most certainly lacking) and act as if this will happen in every case where there is onshore UK fracking. It's absurd and childish, but completely expected from an organisation like Greenpeace.",0,1387066835,null,0,false,0,ce1vls8,t3_1svtpg,t1_ce1vls8,t1_ce1v0t6,null,1428131287,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"I'm sorry, but this simply is incorrect. Everyone, even Alistair Darling and David Cameron, have said that Scotland could get by on it's own. Taking into account the oil, on the East and West coasts, some of the greatest green energy potentials in the world and the other Scottish industries Scotland generates much income. If you take into account the interest on a national debt that is largely run up by England, defenseman spending and various other costs it quickly becomes apparent that Scotland gives as much as it takes, if not far more. With correct governance and some luck, Scotland has the potential to flourish.

The UK is not withstanding the power of the banks not because it *can't* stand up to them, it is because it is stuck with a totally inadequate political system that *chooses* not to stand up to them. These are the people who presided over the destruction of our industry, and our shift to a service based economy. This, in turn, destroyed our self sufficiency and landed us in this current mess.

The problem lies with the political system. With independence we can create a new political system from the ground up, and ensure we control it. Or we can stay in the UK and try to reform the current system, with constitutional reform. What we *cannot* do is resign ourselves to the lorded over by bankers.

true,Poison1990,cnty-wales,Wales,"This is a great idea in theory, but it would be incredibly difficult to get the people your aiming at to dedicate time towards something that doesn't effect them directly. These people are busy trying to make money, spend time with their families and friends, and generally trying to live their lives. Whether or not they understand science is of no importance to them because they are never tested on it. It's surplus knowledge. I've worked with different charities and organizations (most wanting to inform people in some way) and it is incredibly hard to get people to dedicate time towards learning.

If you really want to get interesting pieces of science to the masses you need to make the message accessible and fun. The best examples would be things like RSA animate, that vlog brothers history thing, khan academy, TED etc. I think if you want to give yourself the best chance at reaching out to inform people is to make a youtube channel and facebook page (similar to I fucking love science - that very popular but not very scientifically accurate facebook page). On this channel you make short 30s-1min slideshow type videos with you speaking over the top (be sure to try and pack in as much information as you can). Use lots of cool images and visualize key words. It has to be visually interesting and the message concise. Make a bunch of them on all the things you find most interesting. Share on social media (youtube, reddit, facebook, even mumsnet). 

In today's world its much easier to get someone to click a link than to turn up to an event in person. If you're looking for shear number of people exposed to what you're selling then the web is the way to do it. If that isn't your thing, I'd advise you look for people doing this kind of thing already and ask them if you can participate in running lectures. Are there any museums or universities or indie cinemas or theatres in your area doing open lectures? Have you checked?

This statement implies only the EU has something to lose from the possibility of Scotland having to renegotiate. All these things you list are also things the new independent Scottish government has to lose as well, and its possibly an even greater loss to Scotland than it is to Brussels.

&gt;However, I also think the ""Spain veto"" is unlikely in practice. Spain is not one of the architects of the EU project, so I think you have to ask what kind of pressure they would receive in order to keep the EU together - rather than being seen as the country that helped force part of the EU out.

Spain made clear they don't agree with Scottish automatic entry (they're support reapplying), and given recent developments in Catalonia, they aren't likely to change that tone. Catalonia is very important to the Spanish economy, so nobody should write off the lengths the Spanish government are willing to go to preserve its place in their country. They can veto for any reason they want, and its not the place of the EU to pressure them otherwise.

&gt;The system was first implemented in August 1946 as ""family allowances"" under the Family Allowances Act 1945, at a rate of 5s (= £0.25) per week per child in a family, except for the eldest. This was raised from September 1952, by the Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1952, to 8s (= £0.40), and from October 1956, by the Family Allowances Act and National Insurance Act 1956, to 8s for the second child with 10s (= £0.50) for the third and subsequent children. By 1955, some 5,000,000 allowances were being paid, to about 3,250,000 families.[8]
It was modified in 1977, with the payments being termed ""child benefit"" and given for the eldest child as well as the younger ones; by 1979 it was worth £4 per child per week. In 1991, the system was further altered, with a higher payment now given for the first child than for their younger siblings.",0,1387069482,null,0,false,0,ce1wkmq,t3_1swdie,t1_ce1wkmq,t1_ce1wa2a,null,1428130837,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; This statement implies only the EU has something to lose from the possibility of Scotland having to renegotiate. All these things you list are also things the new independent Scottish government has to lose as well, and its possibly an even greater loss to Scotland than it is to Brussels.

Of course. I don't think it's useful to try and cast negotiations in terms of winners and losers - the purpose of negotiation is to ensure that both sides get what they want.

For example, a simplistic argument might be that Scotland wants access to the common market and the EU doesn't want to set a precedent of anyone leaving (AFAIK the existing treaties do not cover this situation).

How badly Scotland wants the EU vs the EEA, or how badly the EU wants to avoid actually documenting the exit process is TBD.


&gt; Spain made clear they don't agree with Scottish automatic entry (they're support reapplying), and given recent developments in Catalonia, they aren't likely to change that tone.

Well, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps Spain squares this circle by accepting that the UK is unique amongst EU members in that it is a state formed of nations rather than the traditional unitary nation state. The Spanish constitution explicitly defines Spain as the ""indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation"", and as such Catalonia is not a nation (in those terms).

This may seem like hand-waving, but was exactly the process used to insert East Germany without any treaty change (also deeply opposed by several existing members, and done via a sleight of hand whereby West Germany essentially absorbed East Germany).


&gt; They can veto for any reason they want, and its not the place of the EU to pressure them otherwise. That strongly undermines the principles of the European project.

Of course, no EU country is going to tell Spain when they can and can't use their veto.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt; The Scottish economy could grow just as the British economy is currently growing: with all the benefits going to the rich. 

I'm sorry, but this is complete divorced from reality. The fact of it is that the Scottish economy *is* growing currently, and at a faster rate at the rest of the UK. Similarly, the rate of unemployment is lower, keeping the most vulnerable of our society safe. The desire to achieve this safety is felt by the Scottish people and politicians alike, both are overwhelmingly against the ""Bedroom tax"" for example.

All of this is happening, why? Because Holyrood is closing hospitals and libraries? No, because it is pumping money into the construction sector, leading the charge for urban renewal (like at Dundee, new swimming pool, new train station, new council buildings, new hotels, apartments and shops to provide people with the space and business to become entrepreneurs) and the ongoing energy revolution (just today, an £800 million hydroelectric scheme has been approved at Lochaber). This building boom is creating jobs for ordinary people, jobs in construction, jobs in the public sector, jobs catering to the influx of visitors and new residents that can come to Scotland for the opportunities it can now provide and more opportunities for small businesses than we have had for a long time.

You claim Scotland needs to attract foreign investment to flourish, and you're right. However, you overestimate what Scotland *must* do, it can survive *and* flourish without giving up the ideals of it's people. 
 
&gt;I'm saying the British working class is stronger if it sticks together and works on an all-UK basis, because we face the same problems. We are all being cheated by Westminster and the City

Independence is primarily about political autonomy - it is about being able to do things like remove nuclear weapons, or increase childcare allowance, or write down the basic principles you think the country should offer to its citizens (i.e., a written constitution), or decide which wars you should participate in.

Participating in the EU allows Scotland to benefit from EU funding, provides Scottish businesses with access to the common market, and allows Scottish citizens free movement through the EU (and vice versa for businesses or people from other EU members).

However, participating in the EU does not require immediate membership of the Eurozone - in fact there are currently ten EU countries who are in the EU but not in the Eurozone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"London Met was formed as a merger between Guildhall university and the University of North London (formerly north London Polytechnic). I think they merged in 2002, because the now north campus was having financial problems and the city campus bailed them out.

Shortly after the merger, lecturers went on strike and refused to mark people's course papers because they objected to the changes in working conditions - and their objections in my eyes were very well justified.

The most telling fact in all of this is that the uni after it formed was the only one that refused to submit results to publications that compiled league tables, claiming that it believed only the formal assessors of educational standards should judge them. Really though, it was obvious that this meant they knew they'd come bottom of the tables and wanted to avoid the embarrassment.

There were a series of lecturer and union problems, and the treatment of academic staff reached ridiculous levels when director of HR, Lyn Link, decided on a policy that their time at their desk in their office would be monitored, coupled with a policy that they weren't allowed to keep their own library of books in their offices. So if they needed to research something for a lecture, they had to travel home to read a book, and were then penalised for spending time away from their desk. Lunacy.

The two most important things though, are when London Met was massively financially penalised by HEFCE for knowingly misreporting attendance numbers, results and droput rates in order to gain extra funding. This resulted in student and teaching union protests that forced VC Brian Roper to resign. And when it had its 'trusted' license revoked to allow foreign students visas to study when it was revealed that they weren't performing any background checks at all on applicants and some of them never even enrolled, just got into the country on the visa and disappeared, often suggested to be working in fried chicken shops.

I went to that uni and was the head technician at the student venues to fund myself through my studies...

EDIT - typed this when drunk, doesn't read very well, but not going to change it now. Also, my PPE lecturers were all great. However I met my wife at that uni, she was studying audio engineering and I worked as an audio engineer so I helped with her studies, and all of her lecturers were terrible. Several could barely speak English, and I actually took to attending her lectures when I wasn't busy elsewhere to pipe up when they got something technically incorrect, which was frequent enough that I got barred from the whole building in which the audio tech lectures took place because I was embarrassing the academic staff, but my access was then promptly reinstated because I was employed by the university to operate some of the equipment they didn't know how to use!",0,1387071888,null,0,1387075540,0,ce1xgfp,t3_1svlvo,t1_ce1xgfp,t1_ce1rp9e,null,1428130291,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

At first I was like nah this is a big logic jump, but who the fuck goes to Salzburg and Copenhagen during a takeover for 'Christmas shopping.' I fear it may actually be something to do with Red Bull...

The main thing I want to retain after this takeover is identity, and I don't think Red Bull would allow us to do this... We are one of the few clubs that still has a strong identity in football that has perhaps even grown in the last 10 years. Of course I want money and investment but if it meant changing the name of the club or the crest I don't think I could stomach it.. 

On another note though, I'm not entirely convinced that Red Bull are involved particularly with the official release saying that exclusivity was being given to an ""English consortium."" And also that David Haigh is headed to Salzburg during a time where the offer is presumably awaiting FL approval (according to various sources) so why would he need to travel all that way to talk to them?

In my opinion.. If there is anything going on with Red Bull it is not a takeover but perhaps a sponsorship or a minority stake (the latter less likely). Perhaps a big shirt sponsorship deal or stadium naming rights?

On a positive note Bryn Law of Sky Sports says he's heard some positive things about the takeover as well as saying that name changes were not ""the tenor"" of what he was hearing. Also, both David Haigh and Salem Patel have mentioned there being big/loud crowds at ER next week against Barnsley, and a reason I can see that being because is perhaps something BIG being announced? I mean it's not like there will have been a huge amount of tickets sold already and for them both to say it just kind of leaves me wondering a bit..

&gt; 
&gt;  Controversial: Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi says families should only be able to claim benefits for two children
&gt; 

I think that if this author said ""families will only be able to claim benefits for two children under new plans"" again but reworded it slightly I would finally understand.

All in all it seems like a good idea but the line ""The plan emerged just days after Chancellor George Osborne indicated he would seek to make further cuts in the welfare budget **if the Tories won in 2015**"" and ""The newspaper said senior ministers had stressed Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, was speaking in a personal capacity."" Have me worried. I'm not sure about you lot but I don't have high hopes for David Cameron keeping his chair.

true,serrapaladin,null,null,"The answer to this really depends on the subjects in question, but if this is someone who has just finished Michaelmas of their first year, it's not particularly likely they will let them switch to something unrelated for the start of Lent. There may be exceptions, so it's best to speak to your tutor (preferably soon), but the most likely case is they'll have to finish part I or IA.

After first year, it is theoretically possible to switch into either first or second year of a different course. Whether or not you'll be allowed to depends on a load of factors. Switching into maths (even first year) is very difficult, as is switching into second year natsci/engineering/medicine/economics (and possibly a few others?) from outside these subjects, since second year tends to strongly build on first year content. Switching into first year is definitely possible, although you will probably be required to have at least an A in A level maths. Switching into most other second year courses is possible, subject to getting a (good?) 2:1 and the department taking you (there'll likely be an interview of sorts). 

Switching into law is the only other potential problem. Generally, switching into subjects with low acceptance rates is more difficult (to avoid strategic applications into land ec and then switching to law). There's a bit of an unwritten ranking, with
 
medicine -&gt; bio-natsci

maths -&gt; physics/engineering/econ

law (and a lot of other things) -&gt; land ec

being relatively easy, whereas the converse tend to be more difficult.

true,7zark77,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"But I think it's wrong to dismiss this pride - people DO feel proud about their country, which they and their ancestors have helped build. Such remarks do not just come from white people, either - I have heard similar comments from the parents of British-Indian friends, who complain that too many immigrants today do not come to work, and are given an easy ride compared to their own experience in the 50s and 60s. 

Now, people can wheel out statistics which suggest X number of immigrants are in employment etc, but this doesn't mean the claim that there are immigrant scroungers, some of whom might be taking our jobs isn't true as well.  

What I think is really damaging to the UK is how complaints about immigration from the working are too often dismissed as racism by the political class - such as Gordon Brown during the last election. They fail to understand that people experience the impact of immigration in different ways and in turn this is what fuels different views about the people who come to live here. 

I think the established working class - especially the white working class - feel they have been abandoned by the mainstream political parties and it's absolutely not surprising that parties like UKIP are starting to do well. 

The media has largely been ignorant of this, too - after the last election there were plenty of stories announcing the death of the BNP because they didn't win any seats, following a series of high profile interviews with Nick Griffin. The BNP doubled their vote in the last general election - mainly because of a big increase in candidates - but they had more votes than the Green party, the SNP, and Plaid Cymru.

true,Wintermute7,null,null,"As someone in New York running low on sleep, to me it isn't about experience vs youth, or skill and potential, its about the top quality players we have playing in a system that doesn't suit them. Easy example of this is Mata. This has all be said before somewhere on here, but here I am rambling once again. 

Mata is the best player we have since he arrived from Valencia, for a lot of reasons, one of them being his consistent goal threat. Whether for himself or setting up others, Mata has been one of the best players in the Leage within the final third. Mata was left off the team sheet at the start of the season because he doesn't play defense. Jose requires all 11 on the field to play both ways all the time in his system, so having one person not track back, for example, is a glaring problem for him. Problem is Mata is a small dude who isn't going to win many tackles and body the opposition off the ball. However Mata, in the eyes of countless folks, shouldn't be held accountable on defense because of all that he brings when we are going forward. So in order for him to play on the field, and help mask his lack of defense, he is shifted out wide where he is less effective in attack but helped by a full back on defense. 

While our squad may be young, you're only talking about Eden, KDB, Schurrle and Oscar. All of them have been playing consistent football for the few seasons. While Eden and Oscar played over 60 games last year, the rest have played and been crucial parts of their teams before they came to Chelsea. If the future of Jose's team is Oscar and Eden, then they are extremely experience because of the lack of rotation last year and playing alongside each other for seemingly every game last year. 

IMO a lot of it all goes back to Chelsea shaping the club the last few years towards getting Pep, as it was obvious he was our first choice. When we realized that we were never in the running, we went to option two in Jose. Jose inherited a squad that wasn't built for him, Jose doesn't play free flowing attacking football. Jose is a defensive coach, first and foremost, who builds a squad from the back to the front. Chelsea bought players for the front, and didn't think about the back. Now before my comment turns into a Winter/Summer transfer ""Which players will fix our team?"" discussion, I just want to see what we have out on loan and in the academy before we spend 15-35 million on (Insert player name here). I want to see if McEachran can play in our midfield, can Piazon and Thorgan Hazard make our rotation? What about Chalobah and the others that we have spent good money on bringing to the club and invested lots of time into, before we sell them for pennies on Roman's dollar. I know its a true FIFA/Football Manager dream, but I would take a ""down"" year or two to settle the ""future of the club"". For example ""Who is the replacement for Terry/Cech/Lamps/Essien etc""  I thought Cahill was brought into transition us from Terry to the next young player from the academy or just young player who got loaned out. Can Chalobah be that player. Torres was brought into replace Drogba, but we don't know if Lukaku can lead the Chelsea line. If the young guys we have don't cut it, then go buy the players who will help our squad in the transfer market. 

The problem with a club like Chelsea spending a year or two bleeding young players, is that once you are out of the top 4 its extremely difficult to get back in. Easy examples are Spurs, those Bale v Inter CL days seem like a lifetime ago, and Liverpool, who had trouble keeping their best player over the summer partially because he doesn't want to play in the Europa League. So how does this all relate to the poor play against Palace? Jose his staff are still trying to shift the balance of the current squad, by training them to work hard on both sides of the ball so that we can be dominant like the team of 2004-2005.",0,1387098102,null,0,false,0,ce257jg,t3_1sw14d,t1_ce257jg,t1_ce24h5w,null,1428126601,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The BoE are legally required to be independent of government policy and to do what's best for the UK economy.

As such I think it's unlikely they will attempt to ""punish Scotland"" in the way that you might expect some politicians too (just look through this thread for the attitudes some people have to the idea of Scotland leaving). Similarly, what's best for the rUK economy would be to have a healthy economy as a neighbour - not to have some kind of northern Somalia on the doorstep.

In addition, I have yet to hear an explanation of how the BoE could damage Scotland without also damaging rUK. The BoE's two main functions are the ability to devalue sterling or to set interest rates. IMO, setting either of those to a level that would damage Scotland would cause far greater harm to rUK.

You get a feel for when it will be safe to ride.

For me I follow this:

* Any sign of snow coming on the weather then I'll leave the bike at home.

* If the road 'sparkling' then it has been cold enough for frost to cover the road then I'll make a judgement call, check the weather if it is going to get much warmer then generally it will be ok but if the temperature isn't going to change quickly then I'd leave it.  If you do take it just take main routes and be very wary of ice/black ice

* Contrary to this if the cars outside have iced windscreens but the road is not frosty I'll usually ride but maybe take a route that follows main routes rather than back roads that I usually take that are more likely to have ice on them where I am.

* Any other weather is fair game - rain / wind don't really matter so much you just need to adjust your riding although be sensible on this (if there are weather warnings then take heed).  As a new rider be extra careful in heavy rain as you won't have as much grip as usual but don't take this as you are just going to slip off your bike as you are not (you still have plenty grip).  Just take it easy.

* SMOOTH inputs on the controls are what you need, especially in the winter season.  This applies to any weather but especially when levels of grip are not 100% due to outside conditions.

* Wrap up well - if you are cold you can lose some concentration and you need 100% concentration whilst riding.

As for the visor, I don't have a pinlock and don't clean it in any special way.. I'll usually just leave it a click open which is usually enough on my helmet but you'll need to find what works for you.

Hope that helps and ride safe.

Meanwhile, the American Journal of Emergency Medicine reported that lifetime use of marijuana is rarely associated with emergency room visits. According to the British Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, this is because: ""Cannabis differs from alcohol … in one major respect. It does not seem to increase risk-taking behavior. This means that cannabis rarely contributes to violence either to others or to oneself, whereas alcohol use is a major factor in deliberate self-harm, domestic accidents and violence.""

true,norney,null,null,"&gt;we’re restoring fairness to the system. 

Fair to whom? A third child who might be made to suffer through no fault of their own? And is that more or less fair than one child being born into poverty with a life expectancy of crime and early death, compared to the next child being born into wealth through no fault of his own? The hilarious dissonance of just this sentence says it all to me. If you're born rich, you deserve it because you've worked hard, if you're born poor you deserve it because your parents are feckless. 

&gt;Capping welfare at two children may seem tough, but setting the cap at three simply wouldn’t deliver the savings we need.

Ok, so it's nothing to do with fairness then. Why not be honest in the first place. 

&gt;Others will say a cap is unworkable because circumstances change. What if a parent lost his or her job just after their third child was born, for example? But getting people to think like this is exactly the point. Under a universal cap, every parent would know that was the risk they were taking and plan accordingly.

So whether or not a child can be fed now and in the future is simply a risk one calculates, like whether or not house prices go up or down, or the value of stocks and shares?

FFS humans are not other people's problems. Other people's children are also your children, our children. 'We' are a society whether you like it or not. If you do not want to partake of that, fine, but why must others suffer for your misanthropy?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;How would you rephrase the question to address the issue of people who cannot afford children having them?

This is literally begging the question.  It assumes that a significant proportion of people who receive child benefits are doing so only because they know that the state will help.  It also assumes that this help is a net negative for the country.  The question shouldn't be 'how do we deal with the problem of paying too much costly child support', it should be 'what is the net cost/benefit to the country of paying that child support'.  You shouldn't start with the assumption of a problem - you should objectively investigate what the real impact of a policy is.

Delaying having kids is arguably a bad thing, both for the child and for the mother.  The older a woman is when she gives birth, the higher the risk of both deformities in the child and life-threatening complications during pregnancy.  Also being older could mean that the parents will be less healthy and active as the child grows up, which could have a negative impact on the child's development.  This could easily lead to higher healthcare costs and/or unemployment benefits in the future.

If anything, I think it would be better to encourage people to have children earlier, rather than later, and that child benefits help avoid other costly payments in the future.


There is also the issue of fertility rate - the current average births per woman in the UK is around 2.0, but you need an average of around 2.1 just to maintain a stable population.  The population growth rate in the UK is mostly due to immigration.  It's ironic that The Daily Mail opposes child benefits, because increasing the birth rate for white Brits would fit their racist ideology perfectly.

If you stop paying as much child support, there will either be fewer children born or more children growing up in harsher environments.  Or both.

Every problem our benefits system faces pretty much comes down to the fact that we as a society won't allow children to starve, whatever parents they have.

It's true that in some cases the welfare system encourages certain families to have more children because they become economic assets rather than burdens. But the bottom line is a lot of people may have 3 or 4 kids and then lose their jobs, what about them? The Daily Mail just wants to condemn them and the children to poverty until they can find work again. There are also some people who have more children than they can afford anyway, regardless of the financial reality, take away the help and you'll just increase poverty and crime, and those kids will likely have a worse future.

A lot of right wingers have this dream of a welfare system where nobody abuses it, everyone is responsible, everyone is rational and everyone pulls themselves up by their bootstraps and noone ever lives in poverty. That is never, ever going to happen regardless of how much they gut the welfare budget. The direct result of gutting the welfare budget will be the increase in poverty and crime.

However, I don't see why you think Spurs are going to suddenly start playing well? They haven't shown signs of playing well at all this season? Okay, MAYBE in their last game. But that's a big maybe. They've picked up points from 1 goal margins, 3 (or more, not too sure) of those  being penalties. Now, we're away, so with that in mind, it's never an easy game to go to White Hart Lane and just play Spurs off the park. They'll be looking to kill us down the flanks imo. Saying that, I think with the way we've been playing, there's a goal or two in there for us, especially seeing as their back-line is a make-shift one atm. We also have to keep in mind that our mid is a bit off, and our back-line isn't exactly formidable. Spurs have some good players; Soldado (you can't say he isn't good) and Defoe, who hit the post a few times etc. That guy can finish if he gets a chance. Spurs will be well up for this, so I can see where you're coming from thinking it'll be tough. But by no means do I think we'll be beaten 3-1 or more. If they beat us I can only see it being by 2-1.

Midfield's going to be essential, as always, in this game. If Lucas, Allen, and Henderson can put a solid 90 in, we've a real chance to take 3 points.

Would imagine Agger takes the armband if he's in the XI, maybe Johnson or Lucas if that's not the case.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt;  It assumes that a significant proportion of people who receive child benefits are doing so only because they know that the state will help.

I'm not sure it does, but even it the number isn't sizeable it still happens. What is the best way to deal with that?

&gt;  It also assumes that this help is a net negative for the country. The question shouldn't be 'how do we deal with the problem of paying too much costly child support', it should be 'what is the net cost/benefit to the country of paying that child support'. 

But if your solution creates an incentive for those who can't afford to have children themselves to get others to pay them to have children you are creating a whole new problem. It is this new problem that the editorial appears to be attempting to address rather than the original problem.

&gt; Delaying having kids is arguably a bad thing, both for the child and for the mother. The older a woman is when she gives birth, the higher the risk of both deformities in the child and life-threatening complications during pregnancy. Also being older could mean that the parents will be less healthy and active as the child grows up, which could have a negative impact on the child's development. This could easily lead to higher healthcare costs and/or unemployment benefits in the future.

&gt; If anything, I think it would be better to encourage people to have children earlier, rather than later, and that child benefits help avoid other costly payments in the future.

It would be interesting to see some data on this. I know you are 100% correct about the increased risks to the child and parent of being an older parent but the benefits in terms of improved resource provision must offset the risks and I'd be surprised to learn that children of older parents have a lower quality of life on average than children of younger parents. 

&gt; If you stop paying as much child support, there will either be fewer children born or more children growing up in harsher environments. Or both. Neither of those are positive outcomes.

The result is likely to be fewer people having children.

Some of it was, yes. Read up on the history of British Leyland. And some of it was complacent mismanagement by executives, and some of it was deliberate gutting of the industrial working class by the government of the day, and some of it was straightforward globalisation. 

None of that was entirely good and some of it was entirely bad. And the parts that were done on purpose were misguided, thoughtless and ill-planned.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;- what has been said is that if a new country was formed outside the EU, and it applied to the EU, it would be treated as a new application.

That's not what's being said here; rather if a territory succeeds from a European state, it would no longer be part of the EU treaties of the parent state, and would have to reapply for membership.

&gt;Given the implications for the EU itself (untangling existing funding, business, and personal links to Scotland from other EU members) it seems quite unlikely that Scotland would be told that they would have to leave in order to come back in again.

But that's exactly what's being said. The EU would most likely take the position that all its treaty obligations are to the UK, and anything else would be an internal matter for negotiation between the UK and Scotland. Nothing flows directly from the EU to Scotland; all funding streams pass through the treasury. 

There are always accusations of 'wishful thinking' when the SNP publishes their views, some of which I believe is unfair. They deserve credit for putting themselves in the firing line and creating an optimistic, ambitious vision for what they want the country to be. But for for the independence debate to be valid, these optimistic views need to be confronted with a pinch of realism, and this view that ""it will all be straightened out because it will be in everyone's best interests to help Scotland straighten it out"" is perhaps a bit naive when it comes to the world of international politics.

All countries can really be counted on is to act in their own best interests, not the best interests of others, and many (not just Spain) might be very alarmed by the precedent of a territory within the EU succeeding from its parent nation and gaining instant EU membership. If nothing else, isn't the goal of the EU greater unity, not fragmentation?

The most likely case is that Scotland would cease to be part of the EU on leaving, with certain provisions in place to maintain trade (open borders, etc), and then spend several years re-applying on its own merits. If nothing else, the EU commission would want to see how an independent Scottish economy evolved over that period, and how stable the state was, before accepting it as a potential liability.

&gt;Currently eight EU countries are ""committed"" to joining the Euro, however several have no timetable for doing so and some have indicated they have no desire to do so either (e.g., Sweden).

You'd suggest the Scottish can get around the Euro with a nod-and-a-wink? That other member states would accept a commitment to join the Euro they knew Scotland had no intention of keeping? The Swedish case is different, and more likely to be the reason Scotland are prevented from doing as you've suggested by over-cautious member states.

&gt;However, I also think the ""Spain veto"" is unlikely in practice. 

Perhaps they would be unable to block Scottish membership completely, but they are in a position to delay it for a considerable amount of time. And I very much doubt they'd be the only nation in that position...",0,1387114833,null,0,false,0,ce27irz,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce27irz,t1_ce1temf,null,1428125522,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Photo is already there, harm is done. Only way to do something now is to take the case to court, where it obviously costs money and if the case didn't result in serious things (like lost of income, good name) courts won't find that case in the favour of that person. So basically, newspapers can do whatever hell they want as long as it is a ""minor harm"", from the legal point of view.

You can also have a look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1spyzh/what_are_your_thoughts_in_relation_to_press/) where I give example of the PCC case, which I personally did. Newspaper basically made a thing up (proved historically) but because it was in the title, PCC said titles need to be read in context with the rest of the article.

true,Simoig,BE,belgium,"&gt;Eden Hazard is better footballer than he was in 2011 when he helped lead Lille to the Ligue 1 title. His decision making and awareness is much stronger. His close control is tighter and he has managed to improve his already-fine finishing. Playing in the Barclays Premier League and training with the quality of the Chelsea squad has helped to make him more of an all-round attacking midfielder.
Yet he’s not having an impact and influence on games as much as he did with Ligue 1. That’s potentially a good thing. He’s not getting old before his time, shouldering the pressure of one team, week-on-week, season-on-season but on the flip side, we worry he allows himself to play second or third fiddle to his more decorated team-mates on some occasions.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; That's not what's being said here; rather if a territory succeeds from a European state, it would no longer be part of the EU treaties of the parent state, and would have to reapply for membership.

I think that's what I said - if Scotland left the UK, it would clearly have left the EU as well.

What do you think will happen if Scotland indicates that it will leave the UK *at some point*, but that given it wants to be part of the EU it is willing to remain in the UK until that process is agreed?

Perhaps you think it plausible that the rest of the EU would refuse to discuss the situation until Scotland had left the UK. I think that's vanishingly unlikely.

&gt; Nothing flows directly from the EU to Scotland; all funding streams pass through the treasury.

That is true, however things like Structural Funds are given specifically to help improve infrastructure in places like Wales or Scotland. Perhaps the solution is simply that no further funds are sent to the UK - personally I suspect the legal situation would be slightly more complex (if a bridge is half-built due to EU funds, who owns the bridge? Who pays the contractors who expected to get paid for the remainder of the work?).

&gt; All countries can really be counted on is to act in their own best interests, not the best interests of others, and many (not just Spain) might be very alarmed by the precedent of a territory within the EU succeeding from its parent nation and gaining instant EU membership.

Possibly, although I think Scotland and Catalonia are really the only two serious cases.

The UK is a state formed of four countries (not a unitary nation-state, like France), and the UK government have agreed to respect the result of the referendum. If you had a similar situation to that elsewhere, perhaps there is some parallel.

Spain went through a civil war 70 years ago, the result of which was a constitution which defined Spain as the ""common indivisible homeland"" of all Spaniards. The situation there is quite different to Scotland - it would be like Yorkshire unilaterally declaring independence from the UK (except worse, since the UK does not have a constitution that secession would be in violation of).

&gt; If nothing else, isn't the goal of the EU greater unity, not fragmentation?

Yes, I think so. Which seems somewhat at odds with the assumption that Scotland would have to leave before it could come back in.

&gt; You'd suggest the Scottish can get around the Euro with a nod-and-a-wink? That other member states would accept a commitment to join the Euro they knew Scotland had no intention of keeping? The Swedish case is different, and more likely to be the reason Scotland are prevented from doing as you've suggested by over-cautious member states.

No, I would fully expect Scotland to have to commit to joining the Euro. However the [convergence criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria) are quite clear - one of those criteria is two years participation in ERM II. The EC themselves [describe this as](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/erm2/index_en.htm):

&gt; Participation in ERM II is voluntary although, as one of the convergence criteria for entry to the euro area, a country must participate in the mechanism without severe tensions for at least two years before it can qualify to adopt the euro.

The Euro is not something that is imposed unilaterally on countries when they enter. It is something they are understood to work towards, but both they and the EC must agree the time is right.

I've summarised the status of the eight [non-Euro EU members here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1st064/scotlands_eu_position_untenable/ce11uwp); I would be interested in knowing why you think the Swedish case is different? Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania have also declined to join the ERM II.

&gt; Perhaps they would be unable to block Scottish membership completely, but they are in a position to delay it for a considerable amount of time. And I very much doubt they'd be the only nation in that position...

Well, maybe. How long do you think it would be for, and who else do you think would wish to veto membership?

Bear in mind that Croatia (ex-communist country, rife with corruption, required to hand over war criminals during accession, long-running border dispute with an existing EU member) was accepted in 10 years. It seems a little unlikely that Scotland would take that long, so perhaps 5 years is more likely as a worst case? That's only a couple of years longer than Scotland plans to remain part of the UK, so it seems pretty unlikely that they would leave purely for the sake of 2-3 years.

It would be the first time in the EU's history that the project has contracted in scope. Personally I think that would attract quite a bit of political pressure. The question is really if it is better to find some rationale by which Scotland is a special case (country within a member rather than a region, etc), or is it better to define the process for exiting the EU and open that door to other nations?

France and Germany probably read the UK's threats to leave as a bluff for domestic consumption (IMO, much like Spain's threatened veto). However, smaller nations like Estonia or Bulgaria may be more willing to walk away from the project if they see that scenario being played out elsewhere.",0,1387116442,null,0,false,0,ce27t7l,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce27t7l,t1_ce27irz,null,1428125387,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Also, plenty of councils pay to private landlords to accommodate people (for example ones which are on benefits). If councils have money to afford monthly payments, which very often are being given for years (even plenty of years), why not use that money to build houses and then give them to those people for free (low rent)? In the long run councils would be better off as they would OWN a property, which could eventually be sold for market value or used for many more years.

I know it would mean more spending as councils would need money upfront to build a house but they should get some government loans to cover that. After all, is it better for a council to pay 1k monthly for 100 years or pay 1k in mortgage for 20 years and after that nothing?

Also, people living in high rental value places, which live in council houses and don't get prospects to eventually move out of that should be rehoused to cheaper areas.

Well you have 2 possible approaches; One is to pay those staff that work part time to do more hours, the other is to employ more staff. Unfortunately, both of these cost more money. 

In particular, doctors who worked 80+ hour weeks as juniors and have *""made it""* to consultant posts, with children and families etc. are probably going to be very reluctant to take on additional hours (since even a part time consultants week is likely to verge on 40+ hours).

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The main function of a central bank is to act as a lender of last resort to the banking system.That is what makes it a central bank. It does this both in emergencies and on a daily basis, which is how the clearing system works.

Acting as a lender of last resort is a clearly *a* function, but I think it's misleading to call it the ""main function"" - the BoE has acted in that role exactly once in its history AFAIK.

The role of a ""lender of last resort"" is to ensure that any debts accrued by a bank can be transferred to the state (or the state's bank), and they will be guaranteed to be paid.

The reason that guarantee can be made is that the central bank controls the money supply - they can print as much money as necessary to settle that debt. In the process they will devalue the currency, reducing its value for everyone, so this really is a bad solution to a critical problem - look at Argentina for a recent example of a country which devalued its currency.

However that is clearly not the only option. Banks can be allowed to go bust (Iceland), a bail-out can be arranged from the IMF (Greece), or temporary loans can be obtained from countries with a vested interest (Ireland and UK). In the recent crisis Ireland received [£7bn from the UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11807769), and UK banks such as Barclays received [£6bn from the US](http://www.standard.co.uk/business/barclays-got-6bn-of-insurers-bailout-cash-6830088.html).

&gt; There is no possibility of an independent Scotland being a part of this system.

I'm glad you can be so definitive!

&gt; As for your comment about the various 'central banks' in the Eurozone-they are central banks in name only and retain their title from the days when they had their own currency.

They are clearly central banks for that country; Germany's gold reserves are held by the Bundesbank, not the ECB.

Perhaps you disagree over the definition of a ""central bank"", but I am in agreement with the Bundesbank: ""[Deutsche Bundesbank is the central bank of the Federal Republic of Germany](http://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Bundesbank/Tasks_and_organisation/tasks_and_organisation.html)"".",0,1387117396,null,0,false,0,ce27zty,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce27zty,t1_ce26uwx,null,1428125301,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Not wanting to sound like Mr Logic from the Viz, or get my head kicked in for potentially being some kind of poofter, and seeing the barmaid coming back over with my pint, I just answered ""blues"". *""Just got to change the barrel luv, won't be long""*, said the barmaid. Bollocks.

What followed was the most awkward four minutes in recent memory, as it gradually became apparent to the bloke and his mates at the bar that I didn't know the outcomes of any recent fixtures, I didn't have a clue about the upcoming transfer deal they were soliciting my opinion on, and I didn't even know who the current manager is.

I was going on the area I live in, my road sees pretty small terrace houses got for ~£200k which I why I put it at £150k as it's reasonable amount. But changing it for the area you're in is a pretty logical way to do it.

If you move and the house is up for private resale then you get your percentage of the house in money. So if you rented-to-buy a £100k house at £500pcm and lived in it for for 3 years then you get around 18% of the resale as you've paid £18k in ""rent"". So if it went for £107k you'd get £19,260 back?

&gt;Addiction is not a choice, it's a more of a mental illness. That's why I said psychiatric ward, as addiction *should* be treated as a medical issue, not a criminal one.

Taking the drugs that lead to addiction is a choice. The addiction is a result of you deciding to take drugs. A minority of addicts have mental health problems but even so, my point is that they ***need to want to be helped*** in order to start recovering. The best program I saw is run by an ex heroin addict who is still on Methadone. He doesn't want people on his program who aren't serious about quitting drugs - he knows from experience that you can't make a half hearted attempt to stop using.

Its getting to the point where I am seriously wondering if we wouldnt actually be better off with either a revolution or simple government-by-lot picking people at random.

The current gen of the principle parties are all pretty much the same shade of shite despite their nominal differences.  A large amount of this, I think, is due to the increasingly homogenised backgrounds of MPs raised from money with little exposure to outside views. At the same time, they all appear to be shades of grey with respect to having their hands deeply in the expense pocket, corrupt in some ways or beholden to the media in others.

Making this current shower of bastards even worse is the massively reactionary politics that they form in response to media criticism, when a large part of the media these days is designed to provoke a massive emotional reaction in order to get circulation and ad revenue (The ""pants-shitting-outrage"" model). In order to do this, the story is massively distorted or painted in a terrible light with little follow up to correct inaccuracies (and indeed no reason to print accurately in the first place beyond maybe libel proceedings in the case of rich, powerful people who can afford some very expensive lawyers). This is one of the reasons why I am absolutely despairing of the fallout of Leveson - the papers can still do what they want with no repercussions. 

So what do people see? They see the people in power being pretty shit and they look around for the alternatives. I believe that they are so desperate, in fact, that they dont really look deeply enough at the alternatives simply because they are so glad that there is any ""opposition"" or alternatives at all, leading to some very sinister people being put into positions that are a cause for concern.

And you then run into the problems of tribalists who make massive apologies for these deeply troubling people when really they should be doing their level best to out them from whatever party they are part of. 

As the relevant example, I have lost count of the number of UKIP councillors of late (last six months?) who have been exposed (or alleged) to have very deeply xenophobic or racist views.

The Bank of England would have no such compulsion to consider what's in the best interest for Scotland having to pay for the initial cost of independence.  It would set rates according to what is happening in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  So if Scotland could do with a low interest rate for a few more years whilst it's high time for the rate to increase in rUK, then Scotland is going to be very disappointed under divergent economies.

Chadli is a winger who happens to be inverted, he still plays out left as a traditional winger (takes on his man, keeps the width, crosses the ball, links with the fullback etc).  Townsend on the otherhand while capable of being an traditional winger is much more of a attacker.

Think with Lennon and Chaldi on the pitch together we are going to try and pull the LFC defense outwards and give space to Soldado and our midfield.  Looks like we are going to try and take advantage of LFC's injuries in the center of the pitch by having Sandro/Dembele/Sandro effectively attempt to bully the LFC midfield (which is not made up of physical players) and by keeping the width with Chadli and Lennon it should allow some space for Small Paul and Dembele (as well as Soldado) to charge forward in the middle of the pitch.",0,1387121822,null,0,false,0,ce2914v,t3_1sxnlw,t1_ce2914v,t1_ce28lbf,null,1428124818,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Whoever's in charge of Spain after the referendum may well decide to make Scotland's entry into the EU difficult, but they would have much less of a valid mandate for doing so than if it was the UK making Catalonia's entry difficult.

Personally, I don't think the Spanish government has the time or sufficient motivation to *ruin* Scotland. If I where a Spaniard I would feel my government had much more important things to be doing. Similarly, the Spanish people might feel a growing new economy with great, (possibly) free universities and many jobs entering the EU might just outweigh any bitterness towards Catalonia. Furthermore, it would not be in the rUK's interests for their second largest singular trading partner and next door neighbour to be going bankrupt. And the Spanish government need the UK to oppose Catalonian attempts to become independent. 

However, this entire conversation is speculation, a lot of things *can* happen with Spain, and I think it foolish to assume that one course of action will be taken, given the turbulent times it faces.

By putting Chadli and Lennon (who is facing Flanagan for LFC which is a fantastic match up for us) on the pitch together it looks like we are trying to keep a great deal of width on the pitch. 

Then looking at the midfield we are putting the bullies on the pitch in Dembele/Sando/Paulinho in an attempt to physically dominate the smaller more finesse centered LFC midfield.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"Exactly right in diplomacy. The irony is the truly stupid EU itself. It set up the procedure backwards as an intention to stop Nation States claiming back powers for themselves. What this refers to is the procedure to quit or renegotiate goes like this:

1. Say ""This country wishes to leave the UK"".
2. Invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty
3. Begin 2 years of renegotiation for either exit or Treaty Changes
4. Put Referendum to the people for exit as per following up 1.

The problem is Cameron is afraid that saying 1. will lead to 4. which will lead to people voting out. So he dares not to say 1. which means he does not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and therefore cannot negotiate seriously with the EU without a major Treaty change requiring consent from all 28 members on any major issue!

Therefore he cannot be taken seriously.

Secondly his negotiating partner Merkel now has her hands tied due to her Coalition partners (iirc Social Democrats in Germany) who want closer ties to EU parties - not less!

The UK Politicians have not given a vote on the EU from 1972. That means any UK Citizen under the age of 59 years of age or who was not a citizen before that date has NEVER voted on membership!

That is quite crazy if you think that the UK says it is a democratically run country. It's not it's a ""republic"" country run by 2 political parties that are interchangeable. I was enjoying the Coalition government tv programme called ""Borgen"" based in Denmark recently: It looked like something I've never seen before: ""Democracy""!

Again when a referendum on the EU Constitution was put before the Netherlands and the French public they rejected it and Barroso carried on irregardless. The Danish government wanted Denmark to join the EURO but the Danish people did not and they are doing very well outside the EURO just as the UK is despite eg The BBC, The Financial Times, Lord Pattern, Lord Mandelson, Tony Blair, The CBI, The Economist, The Guardian, Kenneth Clarke MP, Gordon Grown (former-MP making necessary 5-point plan which was actually a smokescreen) all cried that the UK would fall behind if it did not join the EURO.

I think there's a lot of deliberate misleading with the whole EU/EURO going on on a scale to rival the recent Spying going on. It goes back decades:

The way it works:

* Click on the **link** and you are taken to the live-update comments about the match.  There are two users, one from each side, making comments.  Things actually look pretty good and are easy to follow.

* Click on the **comments** from your own subreddit and you are taken to a comment section that is really, in essence, just like the old match threads.

Possible improvement:

* If a comment could somehow be ""sticky-ed"" to the top of the comment section to contain line-ups, score line, major events that would be great.

true,tombsar,Queens,Queens',"I know several people who have changed subjects. It is easiest to change after the end of Part I (first year in most subjects, or second year in others), where the tripos system explicitly allows people to change. In slightly more exceptional circumstances you can change after any complete year, and this will sometimes be suggested by your DoS if your exams results are not good, but there is reason to believe you could do better in a different subject. Practically anything is possible if you manage to convince your college's tutorial staff, but you must have them on your side.

I do not know anyone who has changed subject *during* an academic year. Where there are health problems, the usual thing is to go home for the remainder of the year (see 'intermission'), and begin again next October. With starting a different course in Lent term, there would be all sorts of issues such as missing coursework and fundamental lecture material that would be nigh on impossible to catch up on (at least for mere mortals such as myself).

Be aware that your friend will have to interview with the DoS for the new subject, and that the decision depends on all sorts of factors, e.g. how many students are expected for the next year. It is probably a good idea to let them know this is a possibility soon, as the staff are deciding on next year's intake as we speak.

The best thing to do, in my opinion, is to bring the issue up with your tutor or DoS, and ask for their advice. If you don't feel comfortable doing this then seek out an impartial advisor, e.g. your college's welfare officer. I can put you in touch with someone very nice, and knowledgeable on the subject, if you PM me.",0,1387124995,null,0,false,0,ce29zrs,t3_1svwle,t1_ce29zrs,t3_1svwle,null,1428124369,3,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,3

And the reason we have the system we have now is precisely because of the law of unintended consequences where families like the Philpott's use children as a cash cow, as a means to get housing or otherwise without caring for their provision properly. The big picture is that reducing child benefits beyond the second child is likely to reduce the numbers of children those reliant on child benefit have, leading to fewer children living in poverty and a reduced benefits bill. If this is tied in with ensuring educational opportunities by restoring grammar schools for the bright but poor then even better. The only issue that I can see is that there will still be parents who just don't care about their children and continue to have kids they can't afford to pay for themselves.

Since 1972: 

*  Treaty of Accession 1972
* Second Budgetary Treaty
* Treaty of Accession 1979
* Greenland Treaty source text 
* Treaty of Accession 1985
* Schengen Agreement
* Single European Act

* Prüm Convention 
* European Stability Mechanism
* European Fiscal Compact

* Treaty of Maastricht
* (Treaty on European Union)
* Treaty of Accession 1994
* Treaty of Amsterdam
* Treaty of Nice
* Treaty of Accession 2003
* Treaty of Accession 2005
* Treaty of Lisbon
* Protocol on European Parliament seats
* TFEU ESM amendment
* Treaty of Accession 2011

And you can be sure there will be more to come eg Fiscal Union of the EZ.

As said, above, the public have vote elsewhere and been ignored. The measures of parliament to avoid Parliamentary Representation due to the ""Party Whips"" undermines this link in the chains (lol) of democracy.

There has been a great deal of misrepresentation of the EU Project. If you were to take some of the soundbites from various UK politicians and what they ""promised"" to the public what the EU was for the UK and compared to what is it now and was aimed at becoming (sourced through historic documents) then I think the picture becomes clearer.

It seems to me to be a good eg of 2 ways in which the state controls the population: 

1. Visibility of Control
2. Tolerance of Control

Make of that what you wish. Here's a link to some sources that suggest the EU was always intended to be a Superstate and not a ""Free Market"" only which was the basis of the promise made in the 1972 Referendum:

It's also probably about price differentiation. Students may not be willing to pay as much as the general public -- but retailers can't lower prices just to appeal to the minority of people who are students. So student discounts provide a way to avoid losing students' custom, while maximising revenue from the general public.

According to his critics, Ed's left-wing buddies advocated ""violent revolution"", so yeah, very similar background, if you want to revert to strawman hyperbole.
Regardless, my point is politicians should be judged on what they advocate now, not pub meetings from 30 years ago. Otherwise politics just becomes the realm of PR facemen like David Cameron. Well done.

Bolded your edit for clarity. 

Your original post wasnt really worth replying to because any fucking clown can see that the comparison of Ayling running around with a bunch of people who have brutally assaulted people of colour in this country is not comparable with Milliband running around with a crowd who certainly advocated violent revolution but *didnt actually get to do it.*

The reason why this story is getting traction is because in recent weeks Ayling was quoted as holding very similar views to the NF and even referenced the NF in a speech she made with some very fucking doubtful remarks.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/send-the-lot-back-ukip-councillor-defends-antiimmigration-video-comments-8991380.html

&gt;She told the Mail on Sunday that she stands by her comments, but that they were “taken out of context” and she was only referring to **illegal immigrants.**

&gt;In the clip, Ayling says: **“‘multiculturalism doesn’t work, Britishness does,” and adds in between takes: “multiculturalism is dead, I’m allowed to say that, but maybe Britishness is waving the National Front flag a bit”.**

&gt;She continues: **“We must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous. Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate,” adding: “I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.”**

Although she says that she only refers to illegal immigrants, that ""multiculturalism doesnt work"" line is very telling.",0,1387127285,null,0,false,0,ce2at1o,t3_1sxlfb,t1_ce2at1o,t1_ce29772,null,1428123990,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

A lot of those nights, as others have said, are at Rainbow. It's often full of a more general crowd, However I saw Deetron and Will Saul there the other day and it was filled with music-heads for the most part (mainly because it was the same night Annie Mac was at The Institute).

There's also Warehouse, which is part of both Rainbow and the Custard Factory. Boxxed is a good venue too but doesn't have events all that regularly. If you like dub/jungle etc. I'd definitely check out [PST](http://pst-club.co.uk/) as well.

true,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,"&gt; when you're living on the poverty line, **a long term investment in education that will cost 9k a year** isnt an attractive prospect no doubt...  

There's that wording again.  

It costs £9000 a year yes, but it's not like people physically pay £9000 of their own money (you can do it that way if you're rich).  
 

It costs £9000 a year but you're not actually *paying* £9000 a year. So what's being poor got to do with that? It's covered and paid for. You'll just have to pay it back to SF when you're in a decent job on or above the yearly threshold of income.  

  

This is the problem: people have the wrong idea about it.  

Student Finance pays the physical cost of it whilst you're there.   

The only problem that faces very low income/poverty line families about sending their child off to Uni, is how that child will feed themselves when they're away from home, if the family is too poor to even send just £20 a week to their child. Even then, that child is entitled to a lot of financial help. Even better if they find work doing a couple of shifts of bar work a week.  

The only reason I can think of as to why graduating from Uni with student debt is seen as this terribly bad thing by people, is because those people don't understand what student debt actually is. They simply see the word ""Debt"" and run for the hills screaming. They shouldn't. It's debt, but it isn't ""that kind of debt"".",0,1387128804,null,0,1387129647,0,ce2bdsp,t3_1svv2x,t1_ce2bdsp,t1_ce2axfn,null,1428123721,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
