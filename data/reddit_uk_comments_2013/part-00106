But if he doesn't feel like doing that, then let's see...

Definitely some 10 and Rose. Maybe... New Earth, The Impossible Planet / The Satan Pit, and *definitely* Army of Ghosts / Doomsday. Plus Turn Left and The Stolen Earth / Journey's End. Would be cool to throw in some 9 and Rose, too -- maybe the first episode plus The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances.

As far as 11th Doctor, I don't know exactly what's going to be in the 50th, but at a minimum, probably Clara's arc (Asylum of the Daleks, The Snowmen, Bells of St. John), and the Silence/Trenzalore arc (Pandorica/Bang (although might be hard to understand without seeing s5), The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon, A Good Man Goes to War, Let's Kill Hitler, Wedding of River Song, Name of the Doctor).

 Now anyways back to it Chelsea did not have to offer Benitez the job but they did, (this should be your first cause of blame in the incident) ok and then brings us to Benitez as manager of chelsea at the end of the day he made a few cock ups with subs, he also showed that Luiz can work in midfield, showed Torres has potential at least in cup competitions, made our defense more stringent, managed fixture congestion very well. 

You see the run Arsenal and Tottenham had to a lesser extent went on, because they didn't have a game every 3 days. And guess what we beat them and still won a trophy. Now I think you're confused we're allowed to say thanks because lets face it the way you talk about him and how he isn't a real manager by your logic he shouldn't have beat Man U, he could have just you know sacrificed the premier league for a trophy on his resume. But no he didn't no one wants him here next season but it could have been worse get your head out your arse.

 If Mourinho was to fail next season, big if not going to happen in my opinion no one will be calling for Benitez to come back, but holy shit allowed to say thanks you could have done better but at least you got us top 3  and Europa Champions, no one is declaring love for him or anything.

Since then I've grown more and more disappointed. Not with him as the Doctor, mind you, but the widely varying character arcs and storylines he's been put through. His second season ranged from alright to meh, and this season is just a general mess, despite a new, likable companion and a fun twist at the end. I'm not saying that there haven't been high points along the way; the end of Van Gogh's episode is heartbreaking, the end of his second season was thrilling and an incredible 'YES' moment, and Rings of Akhaten was amazing, but none of it matches Eccleston's 'Dalek' or 'The Empty Child', or Tennant's 'The Family of Blood' and 'Human Nature'. 

For all of the good moments of Smith's reign, I feel like Moffat's style of almost 'monster of the week' hasn't done for Smith what Davies overarching (and far more regularly returned to) story arcs did for Tennant and Eccleston.

Past that, I have deep respect for the flag and all our national symbols. Someone pulled down the US flag at my college, I was mad. If you ever hear about people illegally killing bald eagles and getting arrested, they get almost no sympathy.

Symbols are much more important to us than they are to you, because your nation has 1000 years of shared history behind it, as do many Europeans. You don't need a flag or a bird for a national identity, you're just whatever you are and British identity is defined by British history. But America has so many different religions, cultures, races, languages, regions, and viewpoints that we need to invent symbols to tie everything together. This sounds fake, but I think it helps create a nation state that doesn't strictly need a racial or religious construction of identity.

I believe anybody is an American if they respect the flag, eagle, constitution and our other national symbols. Those symbols tie us together regardless of race, religion, and politics. So we need the pledge, because we need the flag, and we need the continued symbolic agreement on national unity. Anybody can come here from India or Egypt or France or Russia or Mexico and if they agree to learn about the constitution, the system of laws, and respect the national symbols, they're as American to me as any white native born Protestant guy. So we teach that respect for symbols in our schools too. The key thing to recognize is that the American identity is really more of a symbolic creed, and if it is not often reinforced we lose our identity as a people.

Edit: I'd like to add that this respect for symbols should not be mistaken for blind belief in government actions. For example, polling shows the vast majority or Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.",0,1369804802,null,0,1369805607,0,ca7yu7t,t3_1f2vq2,t1_ca7yu7t,t1_ca6kcy8,null,1430999092,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He's pretty much the best option we had for a Carra replacement. The intangibles he brings played a huge factor in this signing, plus the fact that the City scouts know him. Hopefully we're able to keep him fit/in shape.

true,lianodel,smith,Smith,"Basically, the Doctor ""regenerates"" as opposed to dying—he takes on a new physical form, in a not-so-subtle way of dealing with actors leaving the show. (It's pulled off better than I made it sound.) There have been eleven so far.

So, while many actors play the role, it's all in the same continuity.

The show was on a long hiatus, so the newer series is self-contained enough that you can start there. (Heck, most people start there and stay there.) Later you can watch the older episodes, if you want.

Three actors have played the Doctor so far in the new series, and their respective incarnations are numbered Nine, Ten, and Eleven. I think that your best bet is to start with either Nine in series 1, or Eleven in series 5.

I'd say start with 9 because that's where the new series begins. He only stayed on for one season, even if you don't like his incarnation. If you really aren't into it, skip to the next season. Lots of people *adore* the Tenth Doctor, and you may as well. If you *still* don't like it, go to the Eleventh Doctor in series 5 and give it one last try (if you have the patience).

Or, skip right to the latest Doctor in series 5. That series was another kind of reboot—new Doctor, new Showrunner, and a new companion (supporting cast). I liked it way more, so I might even say this is the better place to start—then watch Nine and Ten, and if you want, maybe watch some of the classic episodes.",0,1369805503,null,0,false,0,ca7z0g8,t3_1f90ca,t1_ca7z0g8,t3_1f90ca,null,1430999010,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Of course a lot of his episodes put him in epic stories where he saved the universe, but in my opinion something was amiss. I often felt like the Ponds and River were the main character, not the Doctor any more. Or at least they shared equally the part.

Being the center of the show doesn't have anything to do with saving the universe or merely a cat in a tree. He rebooted the universe, but it never felt epic in my bones. The 10th in Blink - where he isn't really here - was more of a central character than the 11th in his first 2 series I feel.

Tackling classic *Doctor Who* is not easy, and it's not as simple as watching a television episode. You really do need a plan, and an understanding of television conventions of the early 1960s. There've been sooooooooo many people who jumped headfirst into Episode 1 of *The Unearthly Child*, and then completely lost their way 45 minutes later. 

But if you're as interested in the history and backstory as you say, then definitely persist. Just make sure you know what you're getting into. The satisfaction of seeing an era of *Doctor Who* change is immense.

I think saying Suarez was player of the season in the EPL is debatable, but he's definitely in the mix. But I think its hard to say he's much more influential than them considering that we finished 7th - while Bale almost single handedly spurred the spurs (sorry, couldn't resist) to a top four challenge. I assumed that when you were talking about Suarez being in the top 5 I thought you meant for performances this season (and exclusively this season), hence why I included a boat load of bayern players - because they had amazing seasons. Lewandowski was the best player on a champions team that made it to the finals - Suarez was the best player on a team that finished 7th, now thats not to say that the Dortmund squad the same as the Liverpool one, but he definitely a better season than Suarez. I agree that Suarez would walk on to that bayern team, but so would a lot of players in the world that aren't in the top 5 mix. Personally, I love Suarez - but he's yet to prove himself on big stages against champions league teams, and he's got a bit of a history of antics which also devalues him. Although I agree that he's much closer than I make out.


I went back and checked the statistics for transfers. You were right mostly, I was wrong mostly. I guess I was just seeing these numbers as sensational for the years (because they were so new and unfounded) which left a bigger memory in my mind. 


My biggest problem with suggesting Suarez will get that money is that I honestly don't think there is a team out there that will throw that money at him. And at 50 million I would sell. We're in rebuilding years. 50 million + another 30 Million from transfer kitty would allow us to completely rebuild our squad and add some serious talent into that will be reaching their prime in the years when the majority of our squad will be reaching its prime.

My progress is the fault of the NHS, not ATOS. They're just not helping. They could easily contact my doctors to see if I've had any new treatment, and then ask to see me again to see if it helped. To understand why the appointments set me back, try this metaphor I wrote:

I don't understand how that's clutching at straws? You need to know what illness you have in order to fill out the forms, if you don't know you're ill, you can't apply for disability.

You need to research mental illnesses, they will never go away for me but they can become manageable though therapy and medication. Like I said before, after I've had said therapy and medication ATOS are welcome to check if there's any change in my capabilities.

And you're just a classic example of, you have a facebook? You must be able to work.

My mother takes me to the shops and dentist, to do so is very stressful, I have panic attacks and need to take tranquillisers, as well as needing a lot of poking and prodding to do so because of my depression. The car is hers, these are all details that I don't feel like explaining every time I make a comment on reddit so it just turns into I went to the shop, in my car. I haven't swam since I was a child, I was remembering.

Agoraphobia can scale anywhere from disliking open spaces to being completely housebound. I have a select few areas that I feel *okay* in going to. I can't use public transport.

Not sure what you're referring to with the hypochondria comment.

&gt;Yeah, here's the thing, everytime you try to defend your position, you use a disease that is non-treatable and essentially terminal, and then apply it to YOUR case, which is patently neither.

Um, no, please learn to read. I'm allowed to have an opinion on the parts of the disability process that doesn't affect me, just like you are. At the moment people with non-treatable, permanent illnesses like cerebral palsy have to keep being re-assessed all the time, and I don't agree with it.

&gt;No, it doesn't work like that. ""Only 0.5%"" without a context such as an amount is meaningless. Only 0.01% of people are mass murderers, I suppose we should just abolish the police force too, they're obviously not needed ?

Yeah but the money they potentially save catching that 0.5% is being spent, plus more on top, re-assessing the 99.5% when it's unnecessary. The police force are necessary and do more than catch mass murderers, so it's a false analogy.

However, but structuring the sale of AutoTrader, GMG (which is owned by the Scott Trust) didn't have to pay any tax on the very profitable sale.  What is even more amusing, is they had an operational loss.  This meant they got a refund.

I found this incredibly amusing, because, lets be clear, if I had a few million I would probably decide not to pay 50% tax on it (shocker!) I would probably say to myself that paying maybe £1M tax a year is perfectly fair.  But the line the Guardian took was just full hypocrisy.  What is even more amusing is their statement that *they did nothing wrong*, honestly it reminded me of statement by BarCap which the Guardian had been busily deriding just a few days prior.

Generally speaking, I find the Guardian to be an incredibly dishonest news source, which is very bad for a news source.  They editorialise whilst trying to project an aura that they don't.  Everyone knows that the Sun or the Mirror are just a crock of poo, they don't pretend to be anything else, the Daily Mail reveals in its mixture of condemnation and moral gluttony.  The Guardian pretends to be something it isn't.

Rather than just been negative about papers, I feel I should mention I really like The Economist, because they don't rush to crank out articles, they produce a small amount of very high quality writings, they are very open about any bias, they are seldom hypocritical without acknowledging and attempting to explain why.  They also don't editorialise content in the same way, for instance the Guardian uses the term Scroungers more than the DM (see my other post in this thread).  I find that they will attempt to make an emotional argument, rather than a factual one, they attempt to label anyone who disagrees with their views as some kind of *lesser* this can be a toothless EDL jokel representing all those who oppose immigration, or someone who questions £80k+ earners getting child benefit, considers everyone scroungers.

Also what sort of industry are you wanting to work? If you're looking at working in construction then obviously opportunities are harder to find these days, one option would be to get a job as a 'mate' and then fund college yourself. For more industrial sectors you just have to scour company websites for apprenticeships, they are out there, although January/ February is when the process usually starts, ready for enrolment at college in September.

&gt;Club flags will be flown at half-mast all day as a mark of respect to those who lost their lives, while managing director Ian Ayre will place a floral tribute at the foot of the Heysel Memorial Plaque in the Centenary Stand this morning.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"I just don't see how automated snooping gives an advantage to security services over targeted snooping, apparently the security services don't either. In theory the Orwellian system sounds incredibly powerful; every website anyone visits automatically stored and scanned, anything on a ""red flag"" list automatically comes up and you can do further investigation.

The further investigation part is the problem for me; we will *always* have limited resources in this area, not because of finances but because there is only a certain number of people that are good at a certain type of work. 

Imagine you're the head of MI5 and you have to allocated resources. Too many red flags means too much time spent investigating false positives which means you adopt tactics that help you rule stuff out quickly... Only, you're the guy that stops terrorists, the head of the MI5, you get something wrong, people die, you get called to hearings, you loose your job, so you don't want to get into a habit of ruling people out quickly. The best strategy is to pass the buck, its GCHQ's responsibility to do this, they're the one that designs the red flag.

In my opinion GCHQ shouldn't be spying on its own citizens inside our own country, but we'll ignore this issue for now and assume that they are doing this and that they're just about as good at it as anyone can be. So they have this massive snooper system, they collect data on everyone. They are set simple to state goal ""Automatically find terrorists based on their web history."" A huge task with not that much feedback because terrorists a) aren't in the habbit of saying they're terrorists so how do you get feedback until after you've caught some and b) there aren't actually that many terrorists c) the definition of terrorist is fuzzy (In my opinion the guys in Woolwich aren't so much terrorists as deranged crack heads who just happen to be followers of Islam, hence the MI5's response here).

So you're set the monumental task of designing this algorithm and you spend years doing it, its about as good as an algorithm can be. Its not real time, but close enough that you can send the data to MI5 only, how do they collect feeback? How do they know when to spend a week, a month a year investigating people?

Combine this hard to get feedback problem with the fact that there are obvious ways to get around this system: VPNs, Proxies, Tor, using ""burner"" mobile 3G internet connections.

In my opinion, making officers have to provide evidence before getting a wire tap is a constraint that actually improves our security because they aren't wasting time trying to spy on every conversation on the off chance that someone mentions blowing up a building.

So I pose a fundamental question: *Is an automated system even an improvement over selectively wire tapping people?*. If the answer is no, which I strongly suspect it is, In this case, what the MI5 need is a simpler system for getting warrants; have expert judges on call 24-hours a day to look over warrants and sign them off quickly, the delay could be as little as 10 minutes for a wire tap to be set up but it would be legal and it would be good, every month have a comprehensive review by a panel of judges to look at the activity of the officers and judges involved to insure no foul play.

Beyond this government's ""theory"" or argument for the system seems to be two-fold: Prevent radicals for becoming radicals and build cases against people suspected of terrorism. I don't think it will stop radicals spouting their message, people have a right to free speech and assembly and we can try and stop them, but there will always be nut jobs. Secondly, I beg you to name one case, since 9-11, in which has a western power ever had trouble locking up a suspected terrorist.",0,1369822160,null,0,false,0,ca81ljk,t3_1f81gy,t1_ca81ljk,t3_1f81gy,null,1430997792,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I get the feeling we may be going the wrong way with this.

Trying to rally people against this kind of scam is...good, yes. However, there are ways for it to work for the people, not the company.

As an example, I was in a workfare program for Matalans. The location was crap, the pay was terrible, the conditions were probably illegal, and I felt neither valued nor respected by anyone who wasn't a uniform-wearing drone just like me.

Having said that, I worked hard enough persistently enough during the workfare that they took me on. I worked at it for another eleven months before appylying for another, better job. I got it.

The system CAN work for the people on workfare, our problem is the companies themselves. Surely by showing that they're willing to leave the program when its accused of being unfair or cruel, are we not risking some otherwise good-naturred companies leaving as well as those that genuinely don't care for the people they sort-of employ and are only looking for a good (albeit subtle) PR boost?

Maybe an adjustment could have been made. Perhaps there could have been checks and balances in place to ensure that companies weren't just exploiting the people they were sent.

Maybe each individual store partaking in the event had to contact a central body if there was ever a dispute or a record of significant misconduct. Maybe that central body would have the power to remove an individual from that workfare and under a three-warning system, have the power to revoke their benefits. This will wheedle out the genuinely workshy from the genuinely exploited.

On the flipside, if a company cannot adequately justify not taking on an employee, perhaps make it as part of the workfare contract that they must have signed at some point that they then HAVE to take that person on, and HAVE to guarantee that person at least five years' work, or until a time when the person chooses to leave if that comes before five years is up.

What if we strengthened that by saying that the company couldn't justify not hiring someone unless the person knowingly acted contrary to company policy or acted illegally. If the company can prove this then the company itself would not be at fault.

Lets then say that if the company is continually unwilling to justify its treatment of those on workfare that it is getting as essentially free labour then it is to me removed from the program and charged with a tax, which will go towards running the workfare system.

This will help ensure that those that genuinely have no desire to work are whittled out quickly. There are always going to be genuine cases of being workshy, and that's fine, but it means the state doesn't have to try and lumber them in the same boat as everyone else.

It will ensure that those on the workfare programs get a better deal with more security. They cease being proverbial Stormtroopers and start becoming more independant.

It will mean that the companies involved have to actually answer to someone when it comes to issues of legality or treatment or working conditions. 

It will mean that the Workfare program is not only more likely to get people into work, but that if the companies in question are willing to acknowledge these terms, that the companies are likely to be better equipped in terms of simple human decency to get them into work in the first place.

true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","Something you've missed is that there is the potential for a company to reduce it's staffing overheads by using workfare-supplied staff.  The article briefly mentions that (paid) staff at B&amp;M have had their hours cut since B&amp;M started using workfare.  

That's the bit that galls me more than anything else.  I've no problem with people being on workfare **if it means that they at least get some additional skills/experience out of it** but not if that means people already in work losing their hours or jobs.  That just makes the employment situation worse and increases the companies profits at the tax-payer's expense.  If you carry out down that route the end-point is that everyone ends up on JSA and the only ones making any money are the company's shareholders.  

My own pulled-out-of-thin-air suggestion is that companies who are looking to hire for a position are able to take a certain number of candidates on for an unpaid trial period.  The candidates still receive JSA and the company has four weeks to determine the best candidate for the job and the position is guaranteed for a minimum of three months, which seems to be the usual probationary period these days.  That way you've got people who should in theory at least be motivated to work hard to get the position doing the work and the company gets a labour boost without being able to cycle through a different bunch every four weeks.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; It is going to take a century of backing off and not throwing fuel on this flame to correct the problem. 

well if this is really about cause and effect and not justification, lets be honest. The west is not going to 'back off' international politics for 100 years. It's not only unlikely, it's impossible. And as the extremists regard everything from carpet bombing to writing a letter as 'intervention', they will never be short of reasons to bomb, kill and main civilians in the west. 

Also, using the fire analogy, backing off is no way to stop a fire, especially if the fuel is self-perpetuating. what you need to do is put it out, not wait for it to die out.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"It’s almost as if the left has let itself get backed into a corner by events; it obviously needs to oppose the EDL and stick up for the religious freedoms of the vast majority of Muslims in the country, but in doing so is ignoring the uncomfortable parts of Islamic culture.

Okay; it’s rather hard to present a nuanced political view these days; the media is only interested in simple narratives. But then I’ve seen people defending the anger of Muslims to what’s going on in the Middle East, as if the reasons given by the attacker were legitimate grievances or justifications rather than insane rantings. One person on this forum even described what happened as *‘an attack on a military target’*!

Of course the war plays a part in what happened, but it’s only one cause in a chain of events, which lead a young man born in Essex to change his religion and become radicalised to the point where he felt greater solidarity with strangers suffering in a different continent then the people living at the end of his street.

Yes, the war is terrible and should never have been started. No sane liberal is trying to deny that or prevent the discussion (it would be a bit late if they did; we’ve been discussing it for a decade). But neither will ending the war tomorrow end Islamic extremism; the Islamists have plenty of other reasons to hate and attack us, as 9/11 demonstrated.

The left needs to be able to separate out the Islamists from Islam and put them squarely where they belong in the political spectrum; right next to the EDL. 

We need to be able to have a discussion about the marginalisation of young Muslim men in this country that isn’t dominated by international politics or distrust of the establishment. We also need to be able to confront the conflicts between western liberalism and fundamentalist Islam without fearing the loss of our tolerance.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"That doesn't have anything to do with why people commit crime. There have been constant and consistent findings that black people (especially youths) are vastly overrepresented in the UK criminal justice system, receive more punitive sentences (longer sentences than their white counterparts), are six times more likely to be stopped and searched, are less likely to be given warnings, etc.

This has nothing to do with the fact that they're black, and skin colour or race doesn't have any effect on someone's instinct to commit crime. Instead it seems to be a series of social factors including social exclusion, caused by underachievement in school, deprivation, poor housing, lack of father involvement and other negative influences in the media and popular culture, which in turn are bred through the justice systems overrepresentation of black males especially.

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmhaff/181/181i.pdf

&gt;Black people constitute 2.7% of the population aged 10–17, but represent 8.5% of those of that age group arrested in England and Wales. As a group, they are more likely to be stopped and searched by the police, less likely to be given unconditional bail and more likely to be remanded in custody than white young offenders. Young black people and those of ‘mixed’ ethnicity are likely to receive more punitive sentences than young white people.


-
&gt;Social exclusion is a key underlying cause of overrepresentation. Eighty per cent of Black African and Black Caribbean communities live in Neighbourhood Renewal Fund areas. Deprivation directly fuels involvement in some types of offence—such as acquisitive crime—and also has an important impact on educational achievement and the profile of the neighbourhood young people will live in. The level of school exclusions appears to be directly related to educational underachievement and both are linked to involvement in the criminal justice system. 

No one's skin colour makes them more likely to commit crime, and the fact these guys were black really has nothing to do with anything. The fact they were extremist Muslims has something to do with it, but that doesn't necessarily tie in with skin colour (especially when the guys were originally Christian and converted)",0,1369826156,null,0,false,0,ca823v5,t3_1f96ek,t1_ca823v5,t1_ca81zgw,null,1430997482,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;  what about laying IEDs on civilian roads

As opposed to ""military roads""? We too use mines for the same purpose on the same roads. In fact, Afghanistan has a huge problem with western mines laid over the past several decades.

Nationality or residency status

You can only apply if:

    you’re a UK national or have ‘settled status’ (no restrictions on how long you can stay)
    you normally live in England
    you’ve been living in the UK for 3 years before starting your course

You may also be eligible if your residency status is one of the following:

    EU national, or family member of one
    refugee
    humanitarian protection (as a result of a failed application for asylum)
    migrant worker
    child of a Swiss national
    child of a Turkish worker

You will note it says **residency status** which means you need to have lived within the EU for the last three years, these rules are for all student finance applications.

true,Deanomanc,null,null,"I'm sorry, but you are wrong. Here's why:

Islam, Christianity and Jewdaism are what we call ""Abrahamic religions"". That is to say they all stem from the same religion of an ancient Jewish tribe; the Jewish religion is the ancestor of the other two. The Jewish tribe believed in a fiercely unpleasent God - one who was obsessed with sexual acts and how they should be done, the burning of anyone else not in the tribe and his superiority over other Gods.

During the Roman occupation of Palestine, Christianity was founded by Paul of Tarsus as a less ruthlessly monotheistic sect of Judaism, and a less exclusive one. It attempted to refine the teachings of the Torah (the actual name of the Old Testament, you know, the part you quoted? It's present in all three religions) and tried to correct it with the more mild teachings of Jesus (New Testament).

Several centuries later, Muhammed and his followers reverted to the uncomprimising monotheism of the Jewish origional, but not it's exclusiveness and founded Islam on a new book - the Koran, adding a powerful ideology - the spreading of the religion via military conquest.

This is why when you read the Koran, passage after passage will call for the spreading of the faith via violent means. Most modern moderate Muslims take a different meaning from it - but only in the way that Christians take a different meaning from the Torah or Old Testament. However, it is plain and clear that the Koran is more violent, it's not even disputed by respected scholars.

true,lawschoolzombie,null,null,"I don't understand how these reports come up. They make no sense and they don't even take into the ability and willingess of clubs to sell or buy. For my two cents worth, here's my opinion on Barca's willingness to buy Mata, bullshit. 

The biggest problem with Mata joining Barca is that they already have a packed (and gelled) starting midfield, Barca's entire strategy is built on any almost intuitive understanding coming from playing for years in La Masia and the system of training. Having a new guy come would take atleast a year to have him settled and working smoothly in the system, even Fabregas who **returned** to Barca took a fair bit of time to adjust and even now has to fight for a starting position. 

Additionally, when your mid-field is essentially a vertitable den of Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets and Fabregas/Thiago/whoever they play in that role. They can't possibly accomodate another dimunitive intelligent attacking mid-fielders unless any of the existing personnel were to leave (or retire in the case of Xavi).

Even more so Mata would not in a million years be happy with being a squad player. I think that the fact that he's the center of the system here at Chelsea would take a lot of precedence over having his Spain buddies in Barcelona. And just about when he's peaking if he were to switch systems, especially switch systems so radically, it would just work against him.

Having said that it should also be noted that Barcelona's problem this season (or ever) has never been based on the lack of attacking power, it's the issues with their defensive portions coupled with the inability to run a good striker system. It appears as if Chelsea also had this problem this season, which was largely on account of our mid-field failing to track back or unable to track back, and this mid-field also included Mazacar. Brining in Mata wouldn't solve any problem or improve the existing system in Barca.

They are much better off looking internally and externally for a CB + FW + DM

Given the [legal requirements](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6dfk86) I guess the answer will be a firm no. If you fell a tree that is on land not owned by you it is trespass and criminal damage (I encountered this when working for the CAB and gentleman got a criminal record after cutting down his neighbour’s tree).

Also be aware that if you fell a tree that has a tree preservation order, is located in a conservation area or is home to a protected species you will also face criminal charges. 

The forestry commission does grant [scavengers permits] (http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-7zpjvv) but only in the North West, but you could always ask. 

[Pepper Woods]( http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/our-woods/Pages/wood-details.aspx?wood=4065#.UaXvAZzHbVs) sells some wood products such as charcoal (or at least they did I no long live in the area) so they might be worth contacting. 

I would also call my local council and ask about what they do with the tree they fell and branches that fall after storms as this is a cost to the council and they may rather mitigate that cost by having some of it removed, after the recent winds many branches came off trees in my local park and I know at least one was removed by a member of the public (well my dog but is was a large branch). 

But to remove anything from private property without the express permission of the landowner is illegal, that includes deadfall.

true,_The_Editor_,eng-devon,Devon,"Good thing that ""you kill yourself"" isn't a side effect then...

There's a risk that a patient commencing *ANY* anti-depressant treatment *may* exhibit an increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour. There's also a big difference between suicidal ideation than actualy suicide. It's entirely possible that antidepressants prevent actual suicides, while increasing suicidal ideation. 

For Fluoxetine specifically there's barely enough data to draw statistically significant conclusions:

&gt;There is less data on fluoxetine than on antidepressants as a whole. For the above analysis on the antidepressant level, the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, fluoxetine use in children increased the odds of suicidality by 50% (not statistically significant due to the low number of cases),[45] and in adults decreased the odds of suicidality by approximately 30% (statistically significant).[42][43] Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the children and adolescents on fluoxetine as compared to the ones on placebo.

[Source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine#Suicide)

Statistical insignificance aside, it's prudent to err on the side of caution. Which is why when a GP prescribes Fluoxetine for the first time there will be fairly regular check ups and reviews. Treatment of mental health isn't as easy as just sending people off to the pharmacy with a prescription for happy pills... Regular reviews, different techniques/medications, CBT, etc., all have to come together to form a package of care. 

Even *if* there's an increase risk of suicidality from the medication, it's still a very effective tool for the treatment of depression. Just because *some* people might have trouble with it, doesn't by any stretch of the imagination mean that we should outlaw this drug. It's effective for *A LOT* of people.

If you've a personal problem with the medication, that's fine. If you're ever prescribed it, then talk it through with your GP and I'm sure they'll be able to offer an alternative you're more happy with.",0,1369831682,null,0,false,0,ca831uh,t3_1f7pb2,t1_ca831uh,t1_ca82td1,null,1430997037,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Batmankoff92,,Lurgan,"The Office of the Taoiseach says the following about the flag based on the text of the Irish Constitution this is the official position-

National Flag

The national flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange. The flag is twice as wide as it is high. The three colours are of equal size and the green goes next to the flagstaff.

The flag was first introduced by Thomas Francis Meagher in 1848 who based it on The National Flag French tricolour.

The green represents the older Gaelic tradition while the orange represents the supporters of William of Orange. The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the 'Orange' and the 'Green'.

It was not until the Rising of 1916, when it was raised above the General Post Office in Dublin, that the tricolour came to be regarded as the national flag.

It is now enshrined in the Constitution of Ireland.

Food: Saffron Brasserie (Indian), Cote Brasserie (French), Nando's (Portuguese), The Eagle (pub, really good fish and chips), the Galleria (modern English, fancy),  Alimentum (modern English, Michelin star), De Luca (Italian). Many fancy restaurants have a pre-theatre/early dinner special, which is 2-3 courses for 10-15 pounds or so. You just have to show up before 7 pm. I don't think I've been to a single pub that I didn't like, but each will have a different selection of beers/ciders.

Afternoon tea: a traditionally British thing, would recommend either Auntie's Tea Shop or Harriet's Cafe Tea Room. Both are relatively inexpensive and tasty.

Transport: You might want to invest in a Megarider bus pass since public transit is ridiculously expensive (~2 pounds/ride). There's weekly and monthly passes you can buy online.

Then either go back to your GP, or go to another. You're obviously one of the people that don't get along well with Fluoxetine. You probably need more of a treatment package than a prescription for drugs, and if you're not getting what you need then you should seek a second opinion.

That may be so, but what was the risk in the first place? Quoting numbers like ""double the risk"" tends to scare and shock people... but if the risk in the first place was tiny, then double tiny is still very small...

&gt; In America it has to have a warning label on it because of the increased suicide risk it presents.

true,mike2R,null,null,"Its fairly pointless to apply these sort of laws to this sort of conflict I think.  But this is the US military's own guidelines for when the Law of Armed Conflict may be violated in reprisal of unlawful acts by the enemy:

Reprisal. 
Prosecuting a LOAC violation may not be possible or practical if the enemy who violates the LOAC remains engaged in armed conflict. However, there is no statute of limitations on a war crime. Moreover, the LOAC permits combatants to engage in acts of reprisal to enforce an enemy force’s compliance with LOAC rules. Reprisals are acts in response to LOAC violations. The act of reprisal would be otherwise forbidden if it was not for the prior unlawful act of the enemy. A lawful act of reprisal cannot be the basis for a counter-reprisal. Reprisals are always prohibited if directed against POWs; wounded, sick, or shipwrecked persons at sea; civilian persons and their property; or religious or cultural property. To be lawful, a reprisal must:

*Timely respond to grave and manifestly (clearly) unlawful acts.

*Be for the purpose of compelling the adversary to observe the LOAC and not for revenge, spite, or punishment.

*Give reasonable notice that reprisals will be taken.

*Have had other reasonable means attempted to secure compliance.

*Be directed against the personnel or property of an adversary.

*Be proportional to the original violation.

*Be publicized.

*Be authorized by national authorities at the highest political level.

true,hdruk,cnty-expat,Expat,"Those are both issues with US forces. It's unfair to use that as an example against the conduct of British forces as they are a completely independent organisation. 

I can understand judgement of an organisation by their past actions though, and the British Army doesn't have a clean slate [(Camp Bread Basket)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4296511.stm)
so I will answer the spirit of the question.


Abuses have happened before, but are rare and in the minority. When rumours of such events are heard, there is uproar, there is inquiry, there is press coverage and there is punishment. Lessons are learned and practice is changed. Since bread basket everyone down to the reservist tea runner must do yearly training in the legalities, how to recognise and illegal order and how to refuse it to avoid this very thing happening again. There is also much higher levels of oversight nowadays. Combined there is a level of accountability.

The reason there is now a backlog is that there was a legal case where Britain was taken to court for a farmer who claimed he had been tortured in an Afghan jail after being arrested by British soldiers. The fallout of this is that the UK couldn't had over detainees to the Afghan authorities because they were abusing prisoners.

At the same time the UK can't charge or judge people for committing Afghan crimes against Afghan people in Afghanistan, not if we want them to become an independent state. As the BBC article states, it became a perfect legal storm because the UK was trying to protect against abuse. There was a way into the system (arrests, surrendering or injured insurgents) but there was no abuse-free way out.

In my honest opinion, I think that the knee-jerk release of these detainees is going to result in abuse of them within the Afghan system. We aren't now handing them over because the Afghan system has improved to the point at which we can have confidence in it. We're now seeing a face-saving exercise because too many people are seeing a very murky and complicated issue as a straight black and white issue. Holding them wasn't right, it was just the least wrong option. In the Afghan system their rights would have been ignored, and releasing them would be a high probable risk to completely innocent and uninvolved parties.

Some of these attacks are not the nicest thing to do, particularly those that use methods with a high rate of civilian causalities, or which ride roughshod over the sovereignty of allied states, but they are still military action undertaken by the military personnel of a sovereign state.

A couple of guys from London aren't a sovereign state, and they weren't the soldiers of one either. In the UK they can never justify the killing of anyone unless it is to defend themselves. If they go abroad it would depend on local laws, except where it conflicts with their UK citizenship.

As British citizens they can not wage war against the Queen or encourage a foreigner to invade her realms, to do so is to commit High Treason. Waging war on an ally of the Queen would be treason since you're assisting an enemy of her and her allies.

The only way they could be exempt is if they had accepted the citizenship of another state, which subsequently declared war on the UK (or US), during a war accepting citizenship would also be treasonous.

This actually leads onto one of the aspects of Islamic Extremism that poses us problems. Pan-Islamism advocates all Muslims being united under one Islamic state. It's why groups from around the middle east and Africa went to fight in Libya and continue to fight in Syria. It's also why a couple of British born British citizens, talked about attacks against their homeland by us.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"As much as I wanted Cavani and or Falcao. Lewandowski would have been ok. All 3 of those players are big and stronge and can play CF better than anyone else we have. Hulk cannot. He might be a useful winger but if we want a Winger/Striker Shürrle is the better choice.
The point of bringing in Cavani or Falcao is to bring in, ideally, another Drogba (or someone with the potential attributes to be another Drog), although in their cases they may be better at taking players on and less at the defensive nature although drills may or may not fix this.
Currently we have Torres who (attempts) to take players on but is not particularly good at defensive tracking back, tackling, marking or defensive heading. He also isn't as much of a poacher as we'd like. Ba who is a poacher but doesn't yet appear to have worked out how to poach with our style of play. He doesn't seem used to all the interweaving of passes in the middle of the park but more to the direct balls.
We need a striker different to all of them. 

Where Hulk can come in handy is in Torres's tactical role where he sits back like a false nine and runs at players and takes it wide or just pops up in the box. He is not an out and out CF. Barring any departures, i.e. Ba or Torres getting the boot, I can't see Hulk being a logical choice. Although, that probably makes it more likely we'll get him. When has logic ever been a part of our transfers?

I believe the best striker available to us at the moment is already at the club.

Bring that logic onward to 11, those final moments with 10 were indicative of his mentality. 10 was forced into feeling that way because of his experiences, 11 actually was that way because he regenerated at 10's emotional peak. 11 is also quirky and alienating because 10 was so attached and so hurt when he had to leave, the regeneration subconsciously made him a socially awkward penguin.

Each regeneration starts off as an internalized version of what happened to the last.

Both MDMA use and horseback riding have short-term and long-term risks. It could be that in the short-term horseback riding is more dangerous. It might have a more immediately risk of death, for example. What about the long-term, though? To point out a long-term health risk from horse-back riding, if you get injured riding on horseback, that injury may never completely heal. However, frequent MDMA use pretty much guarantees long-term negative health effects. I don't see how it could be seen as even plausible that horseback riding would be worse overall. You can look at the average effect on quality of life and life expectancy, but horseback riding isn't America's National Football League.

Yes there are a subset of people who will never pay for something and I'd argue those people are a lost cause anyway. What is the point in trying to force someone to pay for something when they can just turn around and say NO?  I don't think its 1:10 though, I think it's more like 10:1. You only have to see how popular services such as Newsgroups, VPN services, Seed Boxes and now more and more ""VIP"" torrent sites to see that these supposed pirates are happy enough to pay real money to be able to get to the content they want.


And as far as Steam goes, yes I concede the point it does include an aspect of DRM, however it's not intrusive and does not penalize the consumer in anyway. You can install/uninstall as many times as you like on as many computers as you like so it's far far better than any other mainstream DRM system that I've seen.

The purity of powders in general declines with popularity. In the UK, when MDMA started to usurp ecstasy as the clubber's choice, the MDMA was much cleaner and purer whereas ecstasy was mostly junk. Now it's junk a lot of the time as ecstasy has been pushed largely by the wayside.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"This is where it becomes very messy, both legally and morally, and I don’t really have an answer for you.

For example, armed drones bombing tribal villages in Pakistan, being controlled from an airbase somewhere in Texas. You’ve got both parties removed from the immediate conflict zone, yet the conflict clearly extends to both locations. Would an insurgent be justified sneaking into Texas, following that drone operator home and killing him in his bed? Certainly no less justified then the drone operator is dropping a bomb on his village.

Counter-insurgencies are messy by nature, but crossing a border to kill insurgents opens up all kinds of issues. On the one hand the Afgan/Pakistan border is impossible to police, and while the insurgents crossing it are Pakistani nationals its commonly accepted that the government there is unable to control the region, and therefore isn’t held responsible for their actions. They become a form of non-state actors. On the other hand, the military of western nations clearly can’t operate in territories without any legal mandate, or the democratic approval of their governments, and the insurgents retain their human rights even as they lose their rights as Pakistani citizens.

Thankfully the UK isn’t currently involved in this form of counter-insurgency with armed drones. If that changes I may think differently.

My assumption is that the 50th anniversary takes place within the doctors time stream so he is able to interact with the other doctors. I also wouldn't be surprised with we actually see 8 and 9 at some point.

 Imaging the time war as the deepest scar on the timeline. Paradoxes that never completely heal themselves. The Hurt Doctor can be a past, present, and future incarnation of the doctor -the valeyard, the beast, and the storm. 

Looking into the untempered schism as child the doctor saw his potential and promised himself to do no harm. 

The beginning there was good and evil creating the chaos of creation. A third force ""The Other"" emerged the balance between the two, before returning to the matrix. Emerging only when necessary to maintain entropy.

When the doctor looked into the schism through the matrix of existence he saw the Other peering back at him. The Doctor knew that at anytime he could call on that power if needed - but a power that did not  discriminate between the good and bad.   

During the time war as an injured 8 completes ""The Moment"" he regenerates into the Hurt Doctor, realizing that all may be lost - the Hurt Doctor calls on The Other watches instead as the Nightmare Child and  the other horde of travesties emerge into reality. Reality warps and he sees the creation of the time lords and daleks. Reality warps again and sees himself at the origin of the universe emerging from good and evil. 

Realizing that he is still regenerating he uses ""The Moment"" device and erases himself from reality and by default time locking both the time lords and daleks having erased their creation.  

The hurt doctor then reverts into 8's form before becoming 9.

true,Lavallin,cnty-england,England,"A problem with integrating the Muslim communities [1] within Britain is that they tend to be intrinsically self-differentiating.  Islam tends to encourage identification with a global pan-Muslim community (Ummah), either alongside or ahead of national identity, and a necessary consequence of considering one group brothers and sisters is that the rest of the world is *de facto* considered not-brothers, and not-sisters.

Secondly is the issue of language.  Although I'm not a follower of any religion, I do respect the way that Islam tries to maintain textual integrity by insisting that the Koran can only properly be appreciated in Arabic (and given the appropriate historical context).  However, the emphasis on Arabic means that Muslims often seem to the outsider to talk in a thick jargon.  Have a look at /r/islam/ - the front page had ""salah"", ""ayas"", ""deen"", and ""dua"" when I looked.  In most cases this is more of a jargon gap than a true language gap, and is no less than the jargon gap for a deeply technical or artistic field, but at a first glance can reinforce the ""them and us"" feeling.

And I don't know how to address these two issues.  I'm fairly sure the correct way is not to start telling Muslims what to think or what language to speak.  At best this would be colossally patronising and imperialistic; more likely it would actually lead to further resentment and division.

This isn't actually a very useful post, because I have no idea how to even begin making things better.  But I do believe that there are structural issues that make reconciliation and integration problematic.


1.  I'm not highly familiar with Islam in Britain, but I think it's safe to assume that rather than a single monolithic entity there may be multiple different communities, and multiple cultural expressions of Islam, not least South Asian vs Arab, and Sunni vs Shiite.

1) Have a sunni arab leader in Syria, preferably the Syrian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood who are the most organised (Qatar, Turkey). The Saudis would settle for them but would prefer a wahabbi leader who is more likely to align with their interest as well. 

2) Bypass Gazproms domination of the European Gas market with new pipelines. (UK/Europe/USA/Qatar) 

3) End Arab secularism. With Saddam gone, Bin Ali gone, Gadaffi gone, Egypt changed, Assad is one of the few left. (Saudi Arabia)

4) Make Russia an irrelevance in the arab world and severely cripple the Russian Navy. They have lost the port of benghazi in the Libya conflict and if this one ends badly they will lose Tartus. This will severely cripple the Russian Navy's ability to project onto the mediterranean sea. (USA/UK/Europe)

5) Continue with encircling Iran and limiting their influence in the region. Including ending the proposed Iran - Iraq - Syria pipeline. (Everyone)

I promise you this passive ""friendzone"" crap is just as annoying for us gals as it is for the guys who feel they've gone unnoticed unfairly.

If someone is being nice to a girl, it is ***not*** her responsibility to presume that they must want into her pants, and she therefore has an obligation to halt things.

But there was never anything even approaching outright indoctrination.  In fact, from what I remember, around 25% of the places at my secondary school were explicitly reserved for kids from non-Catholic schools, so there was a certain amount of diversity deliberately built in.

My view is certainly influenced by this upbringing, but my I don't think that the general concept of faith schools is innately problematic.  The reality is that some kids will be brought up in a religion at home, and I see nothing wrong with a school that explicitly sets itself out as a refuge, so to speak, for kids who do have a certain religion.  The massive caveat is that adequate measures must be taken to ensure that the schools are not indoctrinating kids.

Granted we had to lose Van der Vaart and Modric, but we did well to replace them with equally talented players.

There was a recent study limited to users of *only* ecstasy, making it the tightest-controlled study so far, that found no measurable cognitive deficits.

Animal studies definitely indicate neurotoxicity, but it's impossible to know for certain how relevant that is to humans.  I'm not dismissing them as evidence, but it would be far more compelling if it were bolstered with epidemiological evidence, which it's not.

Perhaps it would have been different if it were a secondary school but I can't ever remember it being preachy. Nor did I come away any more indoctrinated than I had gone in. Mostly it seemed the same as the secular school some of my friends attended except on the big religious holidays we got to miss lessons and go to church to sing and play with candles, and for an hour or so a week we read about angels and other fun stories.

My personal view would be that, like most thing, it depends how it's done.

I really haven't got a problem with living in the UK – albeit with a few exceptions, I'm extremely proud to have been born here – but teaching English as a foreign language requires some form of travel. I *would* teach English in the UK if the focus were on grammar and the actual linguistic elements, but I just feel discouraged knowing that I would need to completely change my university plans if I weren't to leave the country. Considering I've fought quite hard to make it through my A-Levels and to get a place at my chosen university, I don't want to drop my degree in favour of a teaching course I know I'd regret.

Granted, I'm not ready to leave right away, but I definitely want to pack up and move to the country my degree covers as soon as I can afford it (and, of course, I need to actually get my degree). The problem is that job opportunities with the language here are likely to be filled with graduates, as it's something probably in great demand in British companies in regards to translation. I can't imagine I'll find a job that isn't fiercely-competed over unless I go to the country in question, where teaching jobs are quite easy to get into.

In 1999 the company I worked for went under. I was unemployed so I took a job stacking the shelves, nightshift in a supermarket. It was a new supermarket so all the staff were hired at once.

Several of the people there (we found out later as it obviously wasn't made public) were on some kind of scheme for the long term unemployed.

These were people who were frankly unsuitable and unfit to take on a day's work. I know of 3 staff who were that way - they would not have been hired if there wasn't a government scheme. All 3 of them ended up working full time on full wages for the shop, because by the time the scheme ran out they had gone from unfit and unsuitable to competent. 

A member of my family until recently worked for a company who helped long term unemployed find work. His opinion was that there were many people who had no concept of what was needed to get a job, and what working was really like, who came from families where nobody worked.

We're very quick to say that stacking shelves in a shop isn't a skill that can be acquired, however working a full week is and that's what's needed.

This scheme might have been successful if it was properly done, and there was some mechanism to make sure it couldn't be abused in the way that it so obviously has been.

The players we need to look at are Vertonghens and Dembeles. They are not quite at Bale's level but they are still top-four quality.

Lloris I think we only managed because of the keeper market last season. Very few big clubs were looking to buy a goalkeeper and Lyon financially were in a position of having to sell. That was some good business.

There's always an emphasis on trying to contextualise the story. On the face of it, (mainly) men arguing about diplomatic matters which are slow to come to an agreement and often come to nothing at all (this being an exception) are fairly poor TV and newspaper coverage.

So by referencing and reporting events on the ground at the time they get a more 'interesting' story.

This is obvious in every story - a company's quarterly profits are of more interest if it can be tied to tax changes or rates rising etc.

Roadside bombs in Iraq that killed civilians got more coverage if there were coalition troops killed on the same day. Without it, they're just the endless killings in a ongoing struggle, with it it's context and subtext to a story the viewer/reader is more interested in.

FWIW while initially it made some sense, the foreign and extreemist element in the Syrian conflict means I no longer think it's particularly intelligent to provide more weaponry to the FSA.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"I'd like to see Suarez on the right wing, Sturridge in the middle, and Coutinho on the left, with Hendo playing the CAM role.  Obviously, Lucas and Gerrard holding, Johnson and Enrique as wide backs.

I know very little (formally) about tactics, so I could be full of shit, but hear me out on this.

First off, I put Sturridge in the center because I feel Suarez can be far more effective on the right wing than Sturridge can.  While obviously Suarez would also be more effective as a center forward, I think the difference in output there is less than the difference in output on the wing.  In other words, Sturridge better matches Suarez' contributions in the center than he could on the wing.  Suarez is a fantastic winger; Sturridge is a good winger.  Suarez is a fantastic center forward; Sturridge is a very good center forward.  Does that make sense?

I like Coutinho on the left wing for several reasons.  First off, he's far better in that role than anyone else we've got.  But more importantly, putting him on the wing leaves space for Hendo in the middle.  Coutinho hasn't got the legs Hendo has, nor the strength.  Especially given that we like to see Gerrard given a bit more of a free role than strictly holding, and given that he's not top-notch at positioning defensively, I feel Hendo does a lot to keep us from being overrun in the middle of the field.  A lot of people see Coutinho versus Hendo and match them up in the wrong way: they look at Coutinho's brilliant dribbling, his Alonso-level through balls, and rate Coutinho much higher than Henderson.  While yes, Coutinho is much better than Hendo at these things (and better than Hendo overall, as well) Hendo offers a pretty damn good set of skills himself, and some things that Coutinho doesn't (the aforementioned ability to cover ground, strength, and good defensive positioning).  Henderson is also vastly more effective from the middle than he is from the wing.

Hendo is good for the central role because he keeps the team ticking.  I thought he was having a bad game against Fulham, but when it was over I saw the stats- he completed more passes than anyone else, with accuracy close to 90%.  Not bad at all.  His through balls are also unreal when he does hit them, though he doesn't do it as much as our little keymaster (Coutinho).  He's a willing runner, and after a few struggles at the beginning of the season, he's demonstrated that he can keep his cool and finish reliably under pressure.  Not bad at shooting from distance either (though Coutinho's probably got him beat here too).

Another thing that I think sending Coutinho and Suarez wide does is it splits our attacking threat.  (Again I know zero about real strategy, so feel free to correct me here, I'm just trying to explain what I see here.)  Those two are (arguably, but I think it's pretty clear) our biggest threats when they have the ball.  If you put Coutinho in the center and Suarez on the right wing, teams can shift their defense right to cover Suarez more aggressively and pack the middle.  Obviously this will happen to varying degrees, but I do think it'll happen.  When they're on opposite wings, though, teams can't shift one way without leaving the other threat dangerous.

On another note, Coutinho and Suarez on opposite wings also makes crossfield balls (probably from Gerrard) a lot more dangerous.  If Suarez has the ball and the defense is shifted to his side to deal with him, it's a lot more threatening if Stevie suddenly collects and hits a ball to Coutinho in space than if he hits it to Hendo or even Sterling.

Splitting Suarez and Coutinho gives us more space in general, and spreads out our attacking threat.  They have more time than they would if they were closer together, Sturridge has more time in the middle because the defense is concerned with our wingers a lot more, and there's more space in the center for Hendo and Gerrard (and Lucas) to do work circulating the ball or playing it through to one of the top three.

Also, I just really like Hendo and think it'd be a damn shame to drop him or to force him out wide again when he's been playing so well.",0,1369849551,null,0,false,0,ca88srf,t3_1f9ly5,t1_ca88srf,t3_1f9ly5,null,1430994328,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

While I don't see the UK breaking up - my hunch is the Scots will vote to stay in the UK from a feeling of ""better the devil you know"" rather than any real pro-Union sentiment - things seem to be going horribly backwards.

Harold Macmillan's government, back in 1963, was seen as laughably dated and out-of-touch because of all the old Etonians. Now we have the the same situation with Cameron and chums in 2013 - an inner circle of Oxbridge public schoolites. Yet look at the opposition benches and you see the same class. A narrow circle, out of touch with ordinary people. 

Same in business- it's like nepotism and old-school networks have come back with a vengeance. Want a job in media? Fine if you have an uncle on the board, and have mummy and daddy pay for you to live in London while you do an unpaid internship. Social mobility - once improving with each generation - has gone down the toilet. Mediocrity over meritocracy.

The EU referendum and immigration are a distraction. The real problem with the UK  is the foetid embrace of the bloated financial sector, useless management, shitty apartheid-style education and class hatred, and a worthless officer class that should have been put to pasture decades ago.

12 goals and 6 assists, directly contributed to 18 goals, exactly 1/2 of the total goals celta have scored!  i may be playing around with numbers a bit to make this look positive, but that sounds really, really good when we look at it from that perspective

true,novicegrammarian,null,null,"Brew Lab and Artesian Roast are the two pretty good places in town that I've tried. Consistent, drinkable, etc. Black Medicine is also pretty reasonable, and Peter's Yard is acceptable as well, but the most expensive I've found. Freeman's in Marchmont is good as well, but it's ground zero for moms with babies in prams, and completely unmanageable on weekends because of all the kids running and people stuffing their faces. 

Lots of places offer coffee here, so it's really common, but don't be lured into a false sense of coffee culture--it's just not fully there yet. A lot of places seem to be tea houses that are nice to sit in but that sell absolute swill for coffee that can be really inconsistent, from tolerable to foul. I take a lot of my coffee with milk here, unfortunately. 

Coming from being a coffee-shop denizen in the US Pacific NW, I can say that the places I named are pretty reasonable for their brews, but if you're looking for late night coffee shop culture, try a different city. There's a place called Bean Scene that's open til 10 I think, but that's the latest in town as far as I know, and you're gonna want to get milk with your coffee there. That and it just doesn't seem to have the little shop culture that you get at a lot of shops in the US. Lots of shops are downright rude about it and have little passive aggressive signs about sitting there with your coffee and lots of shops don't have WiFi.

YMMV; still a decent shop though.

Fosters also advertise before and after comedy on Channel 4, giving them loads of money and encouraging them to put comedy at the forefront of their schedule, and commission a load of new programmes that greatly entertain me.

Comedy and music, two things that make my adult life a lot better.

""Any negative effects come from using it long term"": not ALL, immediate negative effects also occur. Even taking pure MDMA it is not a completely risk free thing to do harm is possible i.e. people do just die (albeit rarely), hyperthermia (overheating) is possible, panic attacks do happen.  

Also buying powder/crystal MDMA no longer guarantees purity (or that it is MDMA) much more than buying an ecstasy tablet does. And  vice versa, as another commenter mentioned, there have also been some very potent pure ecstasy tablets  containing MDMA available at times over recent past.

All this also depends where you live.

For me the risk was always worth it. I balanced it out by not riding horses.... I had some of the best of times of my life on E, getting a warm feeling inside thinking about it. Good times...People do say only take it  maybe 3 or 4 a year and at this rate of use your risk of coming a cropper is pretty slim.

Granted, in some movies you are correct. However, I have taken up the liberty of putting a few films below so that you can see the difference.

Some are days, some are many months. The point is that we should not be waiting long. Days fine. Weeks, maybe. Months, no. The problem presents itself even more in TV shows. CSI New york Season 9? Finished about 3 months ago in America, still no sign in the UK.

Supernatural? Air date confirmed, middle August. That's not far off **12 months** after it started airing in America.

House M.D? Although it finished last year, season 8 is the only one to be aired on par with America. Season 6, was the worst in terms of air dates. Aired in America September 2009. UK? We didn't get the privilege until **21st May**. That is a few days after **the whole fucking thing finished**.

In Moffat's run, ""Victory of the Daleks"" was again a cool concept sullied by forgettable execution and power ranger Daleks, they had a minor appearance in ""The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang"" which was a great episode, it just wasn't a Dalek story. Lastly, Asylum was just bad in my opinion, it was more about the Ponds randomly troubled marriage which we all knew would be all dandy by the end of the episode. 

I began with the 2005 series, and so was introduced to the Daleks in ""Dalek"" one of the finest examples of Doctor Who storytelling there is. They've gone from the one creature in all of creation that can cause The Doctor to crack, cry for help and even raise arms to a minor irritation that are a less pressing concern than a couple's bickering.

They are often too divorced from the running of the organisation, and the local managers who could do the necessary -- are not incentivised by being allowed to keep a share of the cost savings they engineer.

Hence, private companies tend to be better at lowering costs when their ethos is injected into previously state-owned operations.

Personally, I am rather agnostic about who owns the company (state/private), but that the ethos of using competition and a profit share motivation is used to drive efficiencies and improvements.

Additionally, here's a post I made earlier today about getting tickets through CIA - this applies to all the games - Indy, New York and Miami.

http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1fa1t0/chelsea_in_america_tickets_for_cfc_vs_inter_in/

If you're interested in getting tickets through CIA, or just have questions, please contact me and let me know.  I'd like to try to help anyone who wants tickets to get them.

===
We now have additional information regarding pricing and scheduling.

First of all - Chelsea is guaranteed to play 3 games in the tournament, as it turns out the tournament has loser brackets at every level.  Thus, Chelsea will play Inter in Indianapolis.  If they win, they will play the winner of Valencia/AC Milan.  If they lose, they will play the loser.  This second round will be in New York.  Then, based on the outcome of that game, they will play either the championship, 3rd place or 5th place game in Miami.

Indianapolis game is August 1st.
New York game is August 4th.
Miami game is August 6th for 5th place game and August 7th for 3rd and 1st place games.

We also have some info on pricing.  They have not been confirmed yet, so I'm not ready to release them, but the Indianapolis game is on the order of what we had to pay for the Saint Louis game.

The New York game is slightly more expensive, BUT your ticket entitles you to go to both games (not either/or - both.  So you could attend both the Winner's bracket game and the Losers' Bracket game regardless of which Chelsea is playing in).
The Miami game is fairly more expensive still, but that ticket allows you to go to all three games.

So, basically, Chelsea is guaranteed to play a game in NYC and a game in Miami.  As I've mentioned before, we need your ticket requests by Monday.  If you already sent me your requests, please resend them if you'd like to alter them based on this information.

Any questions?  Feel free to ask.

Most left is Marxist (or at least inspired by Marx) and thus radically Atheist. The soviets even had an organisation called ""League of Militant Atheists"", whose sole purpose was the eradication of religion. Countries like Albania went atheist from hardcore Muslim within years, with a programme that instituted practically two things: Women bosses and pork for lunch in the workplace.  Damn, the Afganis waged almost a religious war against the Soviets. 

I don't exactly support extreme measures like the above (I don't think anyone in the modern left does), but the lame ""cultural relativism"" picture you have is mostly a social democratic thing. Some leftist strands abandoned the ""main struggle"" - which is **public ownership of the means of production** - and focused on secondary issues (e.g. women's rights, religious freedoms). Although these things are somewhat important, the programme of the left is a programme of radical equality, and if certain ideologies opposed equality, well, too bad. 

EDIT: Also, imperialist wars. Iran wouldn't be a theocracy today, if it wasn't for direct foreign involvement.

With this guy coming we will add more to that, but also a bit more, while defending is nice he also has great mentality.

Sturridge will need to both start defending and become stronger mentally when we are losing, but that is probably due to age and the teams hes played for.

I would like River to not come back anymore, simply because I think it's time to once and for all part with the whole Ponds/River storyline. It's enough, the series need to move on from them. If I have to see River for much longer my brain is going to start growing her hairstyle.

As an adult you may not like the idea of a Big Bearded Man in the Sky telling you what to do ... 

But to control a class of 7 year olds, to get them to sit still for ten minutes and do some Maths it's priceless.

No one should ever die watching a football match, especially not because of fan violence. Rest in peace, Heysel is a 
horrific tragedy that should never be forgotten. 

This extract from an article that Steve Graves (a nonfootball reporter for the Liverpool Echo and Liverpool fan) wrote for The Anfield Wrap that captures how many of
his (and my) generation feel about Heysel:

&gt;I’ve always voted Labour, enthusiastically and without a second thought. Does this place some responsibility for the Iraq war dead on my shoulders? I guess it does. The fact the Tories would have been, if anything, more hawkish over Bush’s war doesn’t change that. It was Labour’s call, people died in their hundreds of thousands (or millions, depending on whose figures you use), and like it or not it happened on their watch, in our name.

&gt;Does the same collective responsibility apply to Heysel? Technically perhaps it shouldn’t. Many of today’s fans weren’t even born. I was three years old. Are we directly at fault, ‘murderers’ as some more excitable fans of other clubs would have it? No, but that doesn’t mean we can’t accept that crowd violence was at the root of the tragedy, that behaviour common among Liverpool fans as well as those of other clubs contributed directly to – caused – the deaths of 39 people.
I suspect much of the criticism of Rob’s piece is based on the false assumption that none of us accept the ‘blame’, if that’s the right word, for Heysel. Many Liverpool fans do, from people who were there that night to those of us who’ve only heard the stories and seen the nightmarish TV footage.

&gt;The ‘amicizia’ efforts before the 2005 Champions League meeting between Liverpool and Juve were heartfelt, the Kop doing what it does best – rising to the big occasion. In truth, though, it was always in danger of feeling like a hollow gesture. Alan Hansen, speaking in 2005, admitted he rarely thought about Heysel even though he was in the Liverpool team that night. But then, what can we do?

&gt;A permanent memorial was unveiled outside the Centenary Stand in 2010, but even that drew criticism from those keen to accuse our club and city of seeking victimhood. Trying to make it ‘our tragedy’ was as bad as ignoring Heysel altogether.
It’s a double bind. We can’t win. And maybe that’s the point – who wants to win when it’s very far from being a game? What happened at Heysel was largely the fault of people who fell under our banner. It’s unfair for fans in 2012 to shoulder some of that burden, but shoulder it we must.

&gt;As a number of Juventus fans made plain at Anfield seven years ago, for many an apology is not enough. Nothing would be enough – no constructive means for resolution exists. Heysel cannot be undone. Perhaps the best we can do is to commemorate 39 Italians, Belgians and an Irishman who never came home from a game of football. To accept that sometimes unfairness is thrust upon you, and all you can do is walk on, bowing under its weight.

Also, [this](http://www.lfchistory.net/articles/article/3228) written in 2005, by Times Football Editor Tony Evans, is the most
honest account I've ever read from someone who was at that final. Not that I condone what he writes, I especially don't condone what he did.

edit:
And [this](http://www.thisisanfield.com/2008/06/kopblog-meets-tony-evans/) from an interview about his experiences of watching European Cup finals:
&gt;Heysel is more complex. I behaved badly that day. I was an angry, 24-year-old working-class boy who was determined not to suffer at the hands of ultras again. I never went with any thought of “revenge” – a word that’s cropped up over the years. What did I have against Juventus? If it would have been Roma I would have been looking for revenge, bloody right. I was wary and aggressive in Brussels, though. I’d seen Italian boys in action and wasn’t going to take any crap. Essentially, I was on a hair-trigger. There were a lot like me.

&gt;I hate all this stuff claiming it was Londoners, England hooligans or a National Front mob who caused the problems. If any of those people would have shown their faces, they would have been seen off pretty quickly. The reason people died was that a wall collapsed. But a chain of events led up to that point that, had any link been taken out, they would have gone home alive. The behaviour of some of our fans – me included – was a big link in that chain.

&gt;People are critical of me for saying this. Loads of people went, weren’t aggressive and saw none of the hostile undercurrent, I know. My mother, my youngest brother and my sister – both barely teenagers – were there and they did nothing to feel blameworthy about. My other brother was with me and was disgusted by how me and members of our group acted. We did nothing violent but were boorish, aggressive bullies. There were too many like me that day and it was very different behaviour from our usual demeanour in Europe.

&gt;I took the ordinaries to matches, drank in the Yankee and the Wine Lodge and moved in matchgoing – away matches, that is – circles. It wasn’t a hooligan culture but they were different days. It was a time of confrontation – picket lines, the city council, Troops Out marches – and that doesn’t even take into account going the match and bumping into the idiots looking for Scouse blood.

&gt;After I wrote about Heysel for the paper, someone on RAWK suggested I was an Evertonian making it up. I suppose this is a longwinded way of saying that the denial haunts me more than what I did. I wasn’t so bad. I was just a prick. But I did play a very, very small role in something that ended up with people dead.

&gt;For a lot of people, it seems to me, there wasn’t even any empathy until after 1989. Now there’s a new generation who think Heysel was nothing to do with us. It was.

[this is a good example of what i mean](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/heysel). none of what Kenny says is wrong, but Parry uses conciliatory language and doesn't talk about the role LFC fans played in causing the deaths. to be honest, the club are writing about it as if it was Bradford (a tragedy with nothing but victims), when the Italians think it was more a case of Juve fans being killed by LFC fans, and the sentences handed down in the UK suggests the law agreed to some extent.

now, i don't think it is quite as simple as just saying any one group caused the deaths or should accept full responsibilty, but i think that they'll carry the anger until that sort of straight apology is offered. whether that is morally the right thing to do is a matter of opinion, i suppose.",0,1369856544,null,0,false,0,ca8beyc,t3_1fa15g,t1_ca8beyc,t1_ca8b00n,null,1430993024,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Saurez --- Sturridge --- Downing

-------------- Coutinho ----------------

------- Lucas ----- Gerrard ---------

Enrique - Agger - Skrtel - Johnson

------------------- Reina --------------

Sturridge likes to drift around, as does Suarez.  They can interchange freely and it'll be a nightmare for defenses to keep track of both of them.  Coutinho is basically our version of Juan Mata, the attack flows through him in the middle.  His vision and ability to pass is just exceptional and he'll be really good at picking out the weaving runs of Sturridge/Suarez.  Our counter attacking potential is simply outrageous with this as well.  We lose a little bit of toughness and tackling power in the midfield while defending though, which may be a bit of an issue.  Downing gives width and works really well with Johnson.  I like having one of the front 3 players most comfortable operating wide because it helps stretch things out naturally.

This is just using the players we have now, so it's obviously subject to change based on transfers.  Sub out Skrtel/Reina/Enrique/Downing for whoever we might sign to replace them if they leave, but that's the basic idea.  Or as a bit of a fun pipe dream, imagine moving Coutinho into Downing's position and sliding Eriksen into the midfield at the top of the triangle.  It's like creative passing overload (though at the expense of some width and defensive cover on the wings).",0,1369856615,null,0,false,0,ca8bfwh,t3_1f9ly5,t1_ca8bfwh,t3_1f9ly5,null,1430993010,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"No problem, well I bought a house in central London (zone 1), it's a terraced house and cost £230,000 which is a bit pricey for an end of terrace but it is in central London and it has two bedrooms, offroad parking and a reasonable sized back garden (small really, but big for London).

I am a first time buyer and I bought the house on my own. For the £230,000 mortgage, I was required to put down a 5% deposit (all first time buyers currently only have to put down a 5% deposit thanks to the government), so that was £11,500 which isn't as hard to save as you might think. The government then gives you an interest free loan for 20% of the value of the property, which was worth £46,000. This interest free loan doesn't have to be repaid until you sell the property (although you can choose to repay it at any time). So in total I was left with a mortgage for £172,500 which I will have to repay. I was able to get repayments of £390 per month for 25 years with Halifax (25 years is the standard length, but you could have a 40 year mortgage or anywhere from 10 to 40 years depending how much you can afford to pay each month), and this includes paying off the capital slowly over the 25 years, so at the end of the term the property will be completely mine.

I didn't have to pay any stamp duty, because the Mortgage providers Halifax pay that for first time buyers.

Anything else you want to know just ask.

It's like you've inherited your Daily Fail subscribing father's opinions, and ran with it.  

&gt;Excuse my french but the UK needs to be more of a cunt when it comes to political matters

No need to excuse your french.  It doesn't make everyone feel like your setting up to say something totally profound and hard-hitting, making so much of a hefty point that you need to refer to swear words to find expressions that are hard-hitting enough.  No, it makes you sounds like Madam Bucket who's trying to make a scene.  Also, '*political matters*'?  Which political matters exactly?  Just, all of them?  All the political matters?    

&gt;I plan to spend most of my working life in Albion

You have no fucking idea where you're going to spend most your working life - because you've just finished university.  If you absolutely, *categorically* know for *certain* that that is the case, then son, you're missing out.  Your life might feel planned, but all you need to do is piss off some guy in a bar, meet a girl, lose a family member, recognise a fetish, and suddenly, your plans don't mean a thing.  If the plan remains the same from now till the day you die - you fucked up.

My facepalm had nothing to do with thinking you're a lazy student.  Incidentally, getting a masters doesn't mean you're not lazy.  I have a Masters.  I worked two jobs at minimum wage whilst I did my Masters part-time for two years - and I'm a pretty fucking lazy guy.  You do a Masters because you have a love of a particular field.  If you're a sucker you'll do a Masters to secure a job you never even wanted.  Don't prattle on about how motivated and qualified you are - there's loads of us.  If you experienced life for a while you'd see that actually, most people do want to do things, try things, go places, work on their passions - they're not all sitting around on benefits.  The vast majority of people on benefits are there because if they don't go to an office and ask for free money they won't eat at night, and a lot of the time it's got as much to do with their personal choices as their hair colour does  - you fucking pillock.

&gt;The only purpose of your post that I can decipher is that of to boost your own self-righteous belief that the actions you have taken in life were the yellow brick road of choices

You try so hard that you spend most of your time stumbling over your own cumbersome deductions.  If that is the *only* purpose of my comment, then it would be a pretty good time for you to remember that you are one of the most educated citizens of any civilisation in the entire history of the world, and you really should be able to do better.  You've experienced nothing but the academic timetable of various institutions.  Life hasn't even happened to you yet - so lose the ridiculous American confidence and get some humility.

I could have said something along these lines first time round - but what's the point, you're not going to care.  So I opted for a joke so that some people might giggle, because it's clear that you're either going to carry on and rule the world one day - or something is going to happen, and your going to sit down with your masters, like the rest of us, and make sport of the young man that's just turned up to explain how he thinks everything needs to be more severe on the poor, how he has his whole life planned out, and how the only possible reason for finding him funny is that '*we all want to boost our own self-righteous belief that the actions we have taken in life were the yellow brick road of choices*' - or some bullshit.",0,1369857496,null,0,1369857687,0,ca8bs2b,t3_1f9iq0,t1_ca8bs2b,t1_ca8azhh,null,1430992851,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Moral of the story: if you have a smartphone, make sure to install anti-theft apps on it. For iPhones, always make sure you install and run the 'find my iPhone' app. 

 For android, take a look at [Cerberus]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsdroid.cerberus). Its a paid app, but with loads of amazing features.  With enough tinkering, it will even survive a full factory reset. Blackberry and windows phone owners should check their respective app stores.

true,octobereighth,null,null,"Well that $75 one is acrylic yarn, not wool. Wool yarn costs more to buy, and also is harder to knit with (in my opinion!) so it might take longer to make. The colors aren't quite the same, and it's a bit narrower (again, narrower = less time!).

The $200 one doesn't specify what kind of yarn, but I would hope for that price it would be wool (it looks like wool to me... see how it stays its full width, while the acrylic one kind of folds in on itself? That structural stability is a sign of wool knitting). The colors are also a lot closer (imo!) and it seems wider.

You may notice that the $75 seller has 3 available, and if you look through sales history, has sold quite a few of these - 13 in the last year or so. This may be a sign that it doesn't take the seller quite as long to make them. The $200 is the only one that seller has available, which could mean it took long enough that he/she doesn't have more than 1 on hand at a given time. It could also mean he/she hasn't been able to sell it at that price, also. :P

Wow, I hope I don't sound like a knitting snob! Not my intent.

I guess what I'm saying is that people price things based on the cost of materials and the time spent, and I think the cost and time for the $200 one would be higher than the cost and time of the $75 one.

Would I expect the average person to drop $200 or $300 for a scarf, even a hand-made, clearly lovely one? Heck no! That's why I made my own!

On the other hand, if I were forced to sell mine, would I feel comfortable selling it for $75, knowing how much time I put into it? Again, heck no!

Then why doesn't John Terry's racist incident reflect on *his* nationality

&gt; If he's brought up thinking that it's acceptable to use those racial epithets (which he admitted to doing, so I don't know why you're denying that) because it's acceptable in that country, then he is racist, and so is the country.

The word he said, was *negro*. Just because a South American won't get offended if you call them ""black"" does not meant that we are an inherently racist society or that the person calling you that is inherently racist.

true,TheFemaleProgFan,eng-wight,Not back on the IoW yet...:-(,"&gt;That's the bit that galls me more than anything else. I've no problem with people being on workfare if it means that they at least get some additional skills/experience out of it but not if that means people already in work losing their hours or jobs. 

   In regard to this quoted bit, I'm going to add some of my own personal experiences and thoughts as someone who's suffered at the hands of three of these slave labour placements.  

   The first and most important thing to state here is that often, workfare schemes simply don't offer anything approaching useful training. Both the schemes I was on did 'equality and diversity' courses and ridiculous 'health and safety' courses which stated the bloody obvious with statements like 'don't leave trailing wires around the floor' and other things which I'd be willing to bet that any 7 year old would know. Actual recognised qualifications such as NVQs, technical qualifications or stuff like the CSCS card (necessary for construction work) had to be found and often funded from the jobseeker's pocket. I was promised on one scheme that I would get computer training, which after several months never appeared and I ended up attending a local college on a night class.
  
  This leads me neatly onto a second point where I think such work schemes of ANY sort fail- there's no filtering according to need. Each person on that scheme is going to be different, and I found it highly frustrating as a highly-qualified, highly-skilled job-seeker being lumped in with school-leavers, and this also applied for many very experienced or qualified people, including those with technical qualifications. Fair enough, there's only so much you can do in this area but still, I found it a great irritance to have to do exercises or complete tasks which were clearly aimed at much lower ability levels because staff didn't know what to do with the fact I'm a multi-lingual, experienced university graduate.

  This seems to also be an issue with the actual placements themselves. I failed often to see how shelf-stacking provided anything approaching the sort of high-quality experience that many (most?) employers want in a difficult job market. Any placement should at least cover a wide range of basic roles in that particular work environment. A retail placement could include basic administration, till training, warehouse work, some security/fire/health and safety training etc. which would provide something of a real set of skills that the employer will want. 

  I agree regarding the idea of work placements being trials for actual paid work rather than the poor excuse for free staff that they are now. This is actually something I've often thought should be the case. I'd also add incentives for taking on totally new staff without any experience (one of my frustrations was 'previous experience needed' type job advertisements).",0,1369860603,null,0,false,0,ca8cyu1,t3_1f9ayq,t1_ca8cyu1,t1_ca81wh4,null,1430992292,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

River Song killed him in the space suit, and then killed him again before he could fully regenerate. So how is there a 12th doctor? So, now, this raises another question; is he even the 12th doctor? Because the doctor knew who he was. He entered his own timeline and identified himself in the future... what? That couldn't be. Every time he regenerates, he feels himself up and looks in a mirror to assess himself (most importantly to see if he is, in fact, a ginger yet). Also Matt Smith says ""The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it’s like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise. He is my secret."" So, what does that even mean? Is John Hurt possibly the... current Doctor? Let me rephrase; is John Hurt another version of the Matt Smith doctor we know and love? Possibly part of the doctor all along? My theory is, maybe John Hurt is the sort of ""bad side"" to the Doctor. The personification of his selfish desires. If you recall, in ""The Beast Below"" the Doctor says that if he kills the beast, he will no longer be the Doctor. This is not because he will have killed something, because he kills lots of things (i.e. Cybermen, Daleks, and all sorts of other scary monsters), but rather because he's killing something innocent. If he kills something innocent, he is officially John Hurt. He's that bad part of himself. I don't know, just a theory.

As for finding housing, the uni's housing is definitely a bad deal, as are any flats in the town centre. I don't know if it's still the case, but when I went there [this forum](http://www.thesinner.net/mb/viewforum.php?f=11&amp;sid=1120e08378f333fc6b85844d4928ad3c) was a good place to look for housing/people to live with.

As long as you're willing to walk 15 minutes to your department, you should be able to find a room in a nice flat or house for &lt;300 pounds a month.

Incidentally, there really isn't a campus per se, so saying ""off campus"" is a bit of a misnomer here.

Well if you found a legitimate reason for making it that would be useful or improve people's understanding of something then you might be able to get away with it if you were really set on it.  

You could try and associate it with some kind of therapeutic research or something, there was a program on channel 4 that had a case study on this therapist who gave her patients mdma and it helped them to go through painful emotional trauma that they had blocked off in their mind.  


It could also be useful in studying the ego and the human psyche, although i think i'm just grasping at straws, as most people think the self awareness and compassion that you can learn from taking shrooms to be some kind of hippy nonsense that isn't relevant in society.   

They could be a better treatment for depression as well, I think there has been some studies (not sure how reputable though) that shows a definite positive effect on the serotonin receptors after just one dose of shrooms. Could be a big thing to find a substance that is better for people than SSRIs and which has no addictive or ""cold turkey"" effects.

If the government doesn't already have such a system in place it definitely should look in to setting one up. In the shipyard where I worked one idea was to have quick release panelling instead of screws/bolts holding them in place. It added a little more cost to the design initially, but saved a hundreds of man hours across a build by simply not having to unscrew panels (not to mention the increased safety should emergency maintenance be required when the ship was in service).",0,1369864015,null,0,false,0,ca8e8pq,t3_1fa2s9,t1_ca8e8pq,t1_ca8dpc6,null,1430991692,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Additionally, if you think this requires parents everywhere to pop around, then by extension, the GI would need parents too. Giving him about a million human bodies or so...  But considering the GI is a bodyless creature... How exactly would that work?

I like this answer and I'll try to further explain some of my post that has been highlighted to need more description and clarity of phrase.


&gt;through his considerable experience - decided that there are a large number of lazy yobs sitting around doing nothing but spend all that tax he's paid on stella and heroin.

This exaggeration of me saying ""some of our lazier population need to grow up"" is based upon cleaver friends who have done nothing but sign on since the age of 18, this is more personal disappointment of friends than preaching about general unemployment. I know that for a lot of people it's the jobs market that is the problem and certainly not the people themselves however where I live I see a lot of the opposite, maybe that's down to me subconsciously only noticing the bad or maybe it's down to who I  have associated with in the past being of that minority. Yes my view is naive, I cannot help this, I cannot have experienced what I have not lived, I have worked 5 jobs in as many years though so please don't think of me completely as a spunky kid with no experience although politically I'm very naive and me saying my opinions can sometimes be interpreted as political grounds. Confidence is somewhat uncontrollable for me as I tend to swing between positive and negative outlooks when it comes to my future, fortunately IMO I've felt pretty confident this last week or so, this is not down to a dick measuring contest as I feel you're implying though.


&gt;It's like you've inherited your Daily Fail subscribing father's opinions, and ran with it.

I do hate when people associate peoples opinions to newspapers and group them because of it. This part of my post does sound very right wing but I'm certainly not opposing immigration, I do however (with an un-politically educated eye) admire how some other countries handle immigration. Take that as you like but please don't turn this into Europe and UKIP affair, I'm Labour (technically) wether thats easy or not to figure out, but I hate when opinions get taken as political attacks.


&gt;You have no fucking idea where you're going to spend most your working life

The plan is to follow my interests which has lead me down the current path I'm creating. The vast majority of my interests lie in England from family to work to hobbies but as you say a nice arse or my favourite, ""recognise a fetish"" (that made me laugh more than it should) could very well change that. I wasn't preaching fortune or future shit more that I plan to do what I enjoy for the rest of my life, what I enjoy may well change though as you say.
[This part sounds like I'm talking to a psychologist]




I acknowledge that my response to your 'facepalm' was border-line fishing for this very good (although creatively aggressive) response from yourself, embarrassment from the cleaver humour of 'facepalm' seemed to have made me take a very defensive approach in a kind of ""fuck, wish I'd have said that"" way.

IIRC (and it was ages ago), a bomb fragment was found that showed it was American and the story dropped immediately dropped off the radar. Most people came away with the impression that it was a device deliberately placed by the Taliban to kill civilians.

Yes good religious schools don't promote or openly indoctrinate but can in subtle ways. Religious schools are allowed to not teach any other religion but their own. This can promote religious intolerance indirectly by allowing ignorance of other belief systems.

true,PlainRubbish,null,null,"&gt;What specifically is it about the UK at present that you take issue with, and pushes you away?

Job Opportunities in my field are slim at the moment and if I had the cash to leave tomorrow, I know i could find employment abroad (friends/colleagues have offered to help me out)

Every country has its pro's and con's. The con's for me outweigh the pro's and I don't see that changing for me in my lifetime. Other people are happy (or happy to some extent) with most of society and how it functions. I'm the one who doesn't like it and I don't think the world revolves around myself.
 
When I've traveled to other places to work.. I've had a much better time abroad in Europe and I know that I can get a better deal for myself and I can contribute to a society that shares my values and makes me feel wanted.. rather than a cash machine when I'm earning or a leech if i ask for any small benefit.

Ive lived and worked in the North, London and in West Sussex.. I wouldn't mind staying but I promised myself once i saved up some cash and if i wasn't happy and settled by the time I'm 30 then I would leave. I fancy some adventure to either Frankfurt, Munich, Barcelona, the US or Canada.. maybe somewhere else if I can find work there.

&gt;For those things you dislike, how would they need to change for you to want to stay?

I can stay and retrain (I am taking a couple of certificates anyway as Insurance/plan B) as what I do now is pretty niche. I can apply for tech jobs now that are several levels below (which i have done) but i'm losing out to people who are also out of work but have more hands on experience.

The future for me is freelancing and contributing to other technical projects (or plan B some sort of IT/Programming. I can either do that in England (and get paid less, pay a higher tax rate, live in a society im not that happy with .. and live in a country that doesn't have anything to offer me) or move to a nice place, get paid more, pay a decent amount of tax.. and have a chance of being happy.

&gt;What about the other country in particular makes it seem like a good place to call 'home'?

To me people make the place and I have colleges that work in mainland Europe and I been and worked in many other great cities.. I'm unsure if i would move and settle somewhere permanently if I can easily work over the internet, especially as the software I use and now create can be hosted online. So i might as well travel and enjoy myself whilst I can.

If I had a partner, then maybe things would be different and I wouldn't be thinking about moving abroad. But I'm taking some time out to focus on myself for the time being anyway. 

I don't feel wanted here, and I know I won't be missed... so i might as well try and enjoy my life elsewhere

I wouldn't necessarily say he 'owes us' but he has certainly put the club through a lot of bad press through his actions so in that sense LFC fans are quite right to expect a bit of loyalty, he did just sign a contract with us after all. It really depends on his reasoning for leaving; if it's truly his family forcing the move then I don't begrudge him a move away but if it's to further his career, get away from the press and collect a bigger pay-check I feel like he could give us one more year. Your attitude is indicative of how little some football fans value loyalty and proves that it is starting to completely desert the game, it truly is a bunch of mercenaries kicking a ball around now. This notion that Suarez has been victimized by English press is overstated, he's brought it on himself and now he wants to run away from it. That, to me, is unacceptable from a player that the fans have given hero status and supported through everything. Football is a fans sport, if Suarez is to leave for the wrong reasons then it really just goes to show how little the players care. And the fans are well within their right to dislike him for it. I'm not saying they are within their rights to abuse the guy, but they are certainly entitled to feel aggrieved. You can do as you please, continue to worship the guy if you want, but don't tell others how to behave when you can't even properly justify your own beliefs.

Like if we were out clubbing/raving I preferred a speedy pill to a mongy trippy pill as I could dance better on it, and if I had a less speedy pill dancing became more difficult to keep up with the music (hard housey/ravey stuff with early trance).

And then afterwards we would go to somebody's house to continue but at a less intense level to talk shit to strangers who very quickly would become the best people you've ever met and then it all starts to wear off and you have to make the decision when to call it a night(or day!) and let the landing commence. This was often due to lack of narcotics/money rather than sense however!

My group of friends were relatively conservative as we did at least go out first and used the drugs to help us dance in clubs/warehouses/forests, whereas other groups just used to stay in and neck loads of pills.

We usually tried to score before going out and so would probably know others who had tried the same batch of pills and were fine. But it was always a bonus to go somewhere new and score in the venue and find some blinding little beauties!

First pill I had was a £25 'Dennis The Menace' capsule - wow! We got several and emptied them out and divided them up so we had about 66% of a capsule each. I went back after a few hours for another third or half a capsule and it lasted all evening.
 
I can still remember the moment I came up on that pill. We were in a high street bar that was packed and had lively music, we were all only drinking soft drinks and after about 20 or 30 mins this track was playing (Bassheads - Is there anybody out there?) and none of us had tried ecstasy before so we kept asking each other if we could feel anything yet, but none of did. Then suddenly the piano riff kicked in and I felt like I was lifted up to the roof and grinning like a Cheshire cat, and just having the most amazing buzz/rush but all around us were normal bar/pub type people and it was difficult to keep it together! Another mate walked in and saw us all like this and he knew immediately what was going on and demanded to be part of the mission team. We ended up in the club and a good night was had by all and we went home when it shut at about 2 am.

No come down and we slept ok. And in fact my mate and I were going to play squash the next evening but on the way to the sports centre in the car, the music got us going again and we just drove around listening to music jabbering instead!

As Mr C said, the Es were good. Whatever the fuck they had in them!
I had one last blast on pills and stuff in 2008 having not partaken since about 2002ish. I went on my mate's stag week to Ibiza and we had all some of this mdma powder, but tbh I wasn't overly impressed with it because it was quite a mongy/trippy high so not ideal for dancing properly, fun though for sure. In fact we tipped a load into our sangria at lunchtime at The Blue Marlin with Peter Crouch (not with us!)and his entourage at the next sun lounger! The pills we got out there were better but not like they used to be.

Now I hardly even drink and I don't really want to get into pills again, maybe because my crowd of friends has moved on from all that with families to raise etc and I'm 43 now!

I do know of one bloke we used to hang out with who died - it was a coronary artery spasm probably induced by coke, he did a fair bit of coke I think. He died years after I used to hang out with him.

I'm happy to not do any more pills, and I think it was much harder to deal with a few years ago for me as I used to feel everything was a bit shit when trying to have a good time on alcohol only. I was always thinking I was proper hardcore when I was in the company of non pillheads in a party environment and I must have just been thinking how much better it would feel pilled up instead of drunk/tipsy. A few years later and I can enjoy stuff better now without yearning for ecstasy, as in I'm 100% fine and normal now :)

If you look at social democratic parties outside of the UK, no-one tries to scrap inheritance completely. What they do try to do is reduce the wealth gap and increase social mobility.

Thatcher famously boasted in her parliamentary resignation Q&amp;A that she'd increased wealth inequality in many parts of the UK, and I can't help question if she knew what social mobility is.

His agent came out and put it down to frustration too.

true,womblybat,null,null,"Yup, and I went to a CofE boarding school from age 9-18. Very old fashioned, latin was compulsory for 1st years. Uniform included kilts, knee length or longer, flat shoes, no makeup allowed. Church or assembly every day including weekends, hour long sunday service. Attendance was compulsory. You had to kneel /stand at appropriate times in the service but no other participation required. 


Had a fantastic, modern science department, were taught Darwin's theory of evolution, taxonomy and classification, big bang theory. Sex-ed promoted safe sex, positive relationships, practically indoctrinated use of condoms and discussed other birth control methods. Also learned about different religions in rs class and discussed social as well as religious issues, such as social welfare, social and historical impact of religion, war and conflict, women's rights, voting and politics. This also included open classes where we could nominate the topic to be discussed. 

Very well rounded education, very good pastoral care. Incidentally we had quite a few catholic students, agnostics and atheists. I myself am not religious, but in the words of Tim Minchin ""I quite liked the songs"". We also had students from around europe including turkey, spain and poland, as well as students from Hong Kong, China, Japan and Russia. We celebrated the christian calendar like christmas, easter and harvest festival, as well as other events such as Chinese new year, bonfire night (without a religious angle) and Burns' night. Catholic students could opt to attend a local catholic church each sunday or for significant services like Christmas Mass. Students could request and organise other personally significant cultural/religious events, which they did, such as Japanese Tea Ceremonies, provided that anyone could attend them to observe or participate, and learn about it.

We did a life skills diploma, which included basic car maintenance, tyre changing without assistance and engine jump starting, finances, budgeting, cooking, and resume writing.


The culture was all about respect (for yourself and others) community and social responsibility, multicultural awareness and sensitivity. Achievement was celebrated. Success was considered to mean achieving your full potential, whether that was c grades or a grades. There was very little bullying. The standard of education was superb. There were no teen pregnancies, one drug incident in the 10years that my sisters and I were there. Whilst I, personally, did not enjoy the boarding aspect, the rest was fantastic. My sisters loved boarding. However, this environment, coupled with my parents' approach to child rearing, led to a rather sheltered upbringing, making me a little naive.

Well I thoroughly enjoyed that, and you seem alright really.

You are of course right to an extent - there are some people that need a kick up the arse.  I can't agree taking social benefit is the way to go - but honestly - I don't have any answers either.  The most important thing for individuals to have is motivation, and you got it in bags I reckon.

I agree that he WAS the tenth Doctor. However, after he is removed from the Doctor's main body, he is no longer a part of his lifestream. The reason the Doctor sees all his past regenerations is because they all exist within him as a part of his psyche or soul or whatever you would like to call it.  
  
He sees Ten, but he would NOT see the Metacrisis Doctor because that Doctor is quite basically no longer a part of him.  
  
Further, the exchange between Rose and ten is metaphorical. He is speaking to the memories and personality which they share. It isn't a connection as much as it is a signature or a stamp. In fact, think of it like a handstamp. A fresh hand stamp can be imprinted upon someone else but that doesn't mean there exists any tangible connection - only a once-shared and now-separate similarity.  
  
You seem to be getting hung up on this idea that Metacrisis is The Doctor in some metaphorical sense. I'm not disputing that. What I am saying is that Metacrisis would not appear in the Doctor's timeline as an older Metacrisis because he is no longer a physical part of the Doctor and therefore would not exist within the Doctor's timeline past the point of separation at which point he was still young. At that point a new timeline is created because they are now two separate lives.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"As an NHS pensions admin I can offer a little advice:

Try to contact every company you worked for and ask them to check their records. If it goes back further than 10 years this will likely take some time as it may be on non digital media. Also, check your payslips and P60s. Seriously, having those speeds up these queries hugely. 

Once you know you have something, ask for your options. Typically there are three options available to these schemes: Refund, Transfer, Freeze.

Refund means you get your money back, less any tax and NI breaks you may have had. If you'd been given the money up front they'd charge you the same amount, so you don't loose out even though it looks like you're getting back less than you paid in. Note that there are often time limits on refunds. To that end, **A pension is not a bank account. You can't just take money out and put it in as you want. You are buying a financial product, this is not a savings account.** Sorry but people do tend to get so miffed when they can't get their money back after paying in for 2 years with the NHS.

Transfer means transferring your pension 'pot' to a new provider. Typically you request this pack from your new provider, you compelte some paper work, the old provider does the same and then you decide if you want to go through with it or not after the new provider makes an offer. This is the route you probably want, you're likely going to be better off consolidating your funds- but that's not a given.

Freeze means you do nothing until you can draw on that pension. You must then claim it.

Get projections and forecasts from each provider that you can as to what you would receive if you left your pension with them. Compare that to what you'd get if you consolidated everything. You can then decide if you want to draw multiple pensions of consolidate them all.

Hiring a financial adviser may be useful if there's a fair bit of money flying around.",0,1369875305,null,0,false,0,ca8i1i2,t3_1f9xc6,t1_ca8i1i2,t3_1f9xc6,null,1430989830,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Adebayor was allegedly on about 170 but was a complete outcast, playing with city's youth team and had no other offers. That's the only reason a) he took a wage cut and b) Man City paid him off/supplemented his wages at Spurs. Tevez could play for plenty of teams in Europe, ones that will come a lot closer to matching his wage demands. 

Every time I think the tipping point will happen- that the number of players on ludicrous wages will outnumber the number of clubs that can pay them- someone else pops up.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"The last part is the crucial bit.  We almost certainly can't replace him with a player of even remotely similar quality unles we're in the Champion's League.  The unfortunate truth in this is that the world class players (and Suarez is world class) generally don't move to teams that aren't in the Champion's League unless there's a strong outside influence (like Falcao to Monaco).

We'll be losing our best player and the ""replacement"" will be a big downgrade.  To be without him is much worse for us.

We can go on and on about how his behavior has been terrible and he's brought a PR nightmare to the club and all that.  But at the end of the day he's our best player and an absolute superstar.  Players like that are needed for the kind of success we're looking for and we really can't let them go unless we can bring in an equal or better replacement.

I can't say I blame him for wanting to leave.  His life in England must be a nightmare with the media chasing him around.  He did it to himself, but it's reasonable to want to escape that.  I'll be upset because we supported him through the most absurd of altercations numerous times and it'll feel like a slap in the face.  But it isn't like him moving on makes no sense from a personal and professional standpoint.

true,yrro,null,null,"I think you are confused by the two benefit schemes here. The original article says:

&gt; ... the government service that allows disabled people to complete online claims for disability living allowance (DLA) only works with outdated web browsers and computer operating systems ...

The old scheme, DLA, [may be claimed by post or online](https://www.gov.uk/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit/how-to-claim) via [the DWP's web site](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/eservice/). This is the site that only works with IE6, and [the government cannot afford to fix it](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2013/05/opentech-2013/). An FoI request was sent to the DWP to ask them why this is the case; [their response](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/dla_online_applications?unfold=1#incoming-394144) explains:

&gt; Your request relates to the Online application facility for benefit claims to Attendance 
Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and Overseas State Pension which are currently made 
using the Tactical e-Service platform. This platform was introduced in 2006 and is now not 
compatible with many browsers and operating systems. As a consequence of customer 
feedback received, we believe the service is too unreliable and problematic to offer a 
reasonable customer service.  As the IT platform is outdated, it is not feasible to upgrade the 
existing service.  DWP Digital Services Division (DSD) is therefore proceeding with 
decommissioning the service and developing a business case to demonstrate the financial 
viability of new replacement services.  The new services which would run on modern browsers 
and operating systems will be fully compliant with accessibility requirements would be based 
on the Government Digital Service approved approach which is being trialled using Carers 
Allowance and Personal Independence Payment.

Now, back to the article:

&gt; The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) stressed then that both the new universal credit and personal independence payment (PIP) – which is gradually replacing working-age DLA – would use new IT systems.

This agrees with the FoI response, but neither seem to agree with the facts:

&gt; But disabled activists have now discovered that it will not be possible to fill in a PIP claim online after all, with the system apparently even less accessible than the old DLA version.

This is the insane part. The DWP are throwing away their old service that is not fit for purpose, and replacing it with... nothing! [PIP can only be claimed by phoning the DWP to request a 50+ page form, which must then be returned by post!](https://www.gov.uk/pip/how-to-claim) So much for the dignity of all the people who previously claimed online, but will now have to ask someone to assist them in making the phone call and/or filling out and posting the form!

Now, back to the FoI response for the light at the end of the tunnel:

&gt; The business case proposal will be reviewed in June. If viable, we would seek to develop the new services as soon as is practical after those dates. 

The DWP echo this in the article:

&gt; In addition to offering a variety of claim formats, we are working with disability groups and claimants as PIP is rolled out to see which parts of the process should be made online, and this is likely to be put in place after the independent review in 2014.

BTW, the same crappy IE6-only DWP site handles other payments (JSA, ESA, IS, WTC, CTC, HB) at present, but these are eventually going to be replaced by [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), which is claimed via [a separate web site](https://www.universalcredit.service.gov.uk/uc/). I'm not sure if this is run by gov.uk proper, or if it just lives under their domain.

true,chamo13,1953,Tore Andre Flo,"This thread has been made a whole bunch recently. Here is my answer (that encompasses most of what people have said):

Malouda, Benayoun and Ferreira are all out of contract. We can't sell them. Ferreira will likely be retained in some capacity, but Malouda and Benayoun are free to sign with anyone they please and we get no compensation.

Marin is also likely out, whether it is through a loan or sale. Can't see him ever challenging Mata, Hazard, Oscar, and potentially Schurrle.

I want Kakuta gone, kid just never quite made it, and after the whole ridiculous transfer saga we had with him, rather get rid of him and forget that garbage ever happened.

Outside of that it really depends. If Mou does take the reigns, he loves Essien, so it would be difficult to predict he would sell him, but as much as I love the Bison, I truly think he should go. 

In terms of loans, I think Lukaku is guaranteed to go back out, and none of this garbage about him going to Dortmund on loan, Chelsea can't do that because it nullifies the chance to make him home grown. He will go back into the EPL, likely Swansea since they have Europa League guaranteed. I think one of either Chalobah or Ake get loaned back out, but not both.

I see Lukaku playing with a physically strong side rather than a fluid total football side.


Back to OP's question. This opinion will probably be downvoted like no other, but hear me out here. I think it's time to sell Ramires and make room for KDB as part of the rotation. If we want to keep KDB, Ramires needs to go. Ramires is probably at or close to his peak right now and since he's physical player, it's probably best to sell him while he's still physically strong and fast. Under Mourinho, I don't think there's room for a player like Ramires in terms of technical ability and passing accuracy.


He's been great at times, works his ass off every match and scored or created some of the biggest goals for Chelsea but there's always that worry that his next pass will be a bad pass or his next tackle is a yellow or red. If Mourinho takes over (fingers crossed), I'm really curious as to what he will do to Ramires. Will be play and if he does, what kind of player will Mourinho shape him to be? Will he be a substitute or surplus?",0,1369888388,null,0,false,0,ca8mg65,t3_1fbapd,t1_ca8mg65,t1_ca8lbia,null,1430987753,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Cawkii,null,null,"1. As much as I do enjoy living life in the UK, I feel both the laws and general society is really suppressing. Based on what I've seen from people living in America everything seems to have more freedom and a better lifestyle. I mean I can't even go camping in the New Forest without having to stay on one of their pre-built camp sites. I just found out they don't even allow hammocks. I love knives as well as tools and objects of beauty, yet the laws mean I cannot own some of the knives that I like to drool over on the internet.  Being a university student I have to say life at the moment is kind because I have my first chance of freedom without worrying about the downfalls of adult life.
2. I see the UK becoming more oppressive, I think the UK has problems with today's youth. They just aren't enjoying what life really could be like in terms of freedom. But the boundary's and laws in this country makes it impossible for kids to enjoy things that 30-40 years ago were perfectly ok. I hope society changes as well. Too many kids think you have to be cool and be in a gang and go round doing illegal things, because that's what you see in this fucking music genre called rap. All these guys showing off about their bling bling and how they went to prison. Of course not all of it is, but a vast majority is showing off and always making drugs seem such a wonderful opportunity. I think hopefully education will become more readily available and kids will be able to learn about things they want to know so they can go off and do what they want. I also think that with the current situations that are going on in the UK the government will make immigration laws and the benefit scheme more tough on foreigners.

A worker cannot expect pay if the worker doesn't work. A company is only slightly less likely to make money with one person short, but a majority of the well-known companies of the day are large enough that even if every employee in a store decided to simultaniously strike and stop working, the company would lose money, yes, but only as much money as they could lose in the amount of time it took the management to just find new employees. Retail experience is cheap.

A company does not have to hire you. To expect pay first is like expecting to harvest before you've sown your seeds. Its called ""earning"" for a reason.",0,1369889889,null,0,false,0,ca8mvdn,t3_1f9ayq,t1_ca8mvdn,t1_ca8fmaa,null,1430987554,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

As few Earth-based stories as they can finagle.  All of time and space, and yet how many episodes take place in London?  At least get out of the English-speaking parts of the world more often.  I liked that Cold War was on a Soviet sub rather than American or something, just because it was slightly more foreign.  Not that it really came up or mattered in the episode at all, but I was glad of it regardless.  There are millions of imaginable planets out there with fictional life on them; I'd like to see more.

I feel like it's inevitable that the Time Lords will come back someday.  Not sure if I want that to happen yet, but I'm open to the possibility.  On the other hand, perhaps they're better off Time-locked.  I haven't seem all that much of the classic series, and very few episodes with Time Lords in them, so I'm not really sure how well they would function in the modern show as something besides a one-time antagonistic force (Rassilon in the End of Time).  Either way, I do think it would be cool to introduce another Time Lord or Lady character.  Not sure how many could have been hiding with fob watches before it gets ridiculous, but I feel like Moffat could come up with sufficient hand-wavey nonsense to bring someone in if he wanted.

If he goes off touting on about Madrid, then that outs us in a very difficult position and gives them leverage in the potential deal. If Suarez is that fed up with life in England (honestly who could blame him?) then I understand and would not hold anything against him if the Madrid interest is true. I would just hope he handles the situation similarly to Bale where he has our best interests in mind. By that I mean, Bale isn't whoring himself out but making his interest known. If bale goes to Madrid then Tottenham will be guaranteed to get paid big time. I could see Madrid low balling us and being forced to accept an offer less than Suarez's worth and a big cause would be due to his handling if the situation.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I don't think there is any desire to intervene in any meaningful way. 

There has been intervention consistently for a long time now they just haven't been advocating troops on the ground because that would seem like forcing a regime change as apposed to helping civilians achieve what they want. They want to achieve the same thing as in Iraq by toppling the government of Syria but don't want the political backlash of it appearing like imperialist interventionism. 

The only reason there hasn't been a similar no-fly zone style intervention as was used in Libya is because resolutions that would likely have led to it Russia and China blocked at the UN. It's not through a lack of desire at all, this is the propaganda that's constantly trotted out in the media and then parroted by the public.

true,soue13,jack,Jack Harkness,"The two things you listed as unlikely I actually think might be more likely just because I know most fans disliked both having a split season and having an individual episode every episode so I hope Moffat will listen. Of course, knowing Moffat, he just might split the season into 3 parts. Just to screw with us.

As for the other things, here's what I think: 

1. Jack Harkness is a beautiful,  wonderful man. This is coming from a totally straight guy. I mean does anybody not feel this way? Everybody loves Jack (Hey! That could be a spinoff show! Like a Torchwood followup with more focus on Jack. I'd watch that.) We want more Jack. We need more Jack. 'Nuff said. 

2. Glad to see someone else doesn't totally hate the Daleks! I feel like in the premiere of Season 7 (Asylum of the Daleks) with Dalek Clara wiping the memory of the Daleks of all records of the Doctor that it was going to go somewhere later in the season. But no. We never saw the Daleks again. Now, I'm sure Moffat was planning on using that somewhere along the road (How about during the 50th! They are planned to appear in that, right?) but I feel like there was supposed to be something relating to that somewhere in this season. I don't know. Whatever. I just want a solid Dalek story where there's consequences for whatever it is that they're plotting. Also, I want the Doctor to fear them again instead of just sonic-ing them away. 

3. Now, you said you don't want an overarching storyline for the whole season, yet you want something similar to Bad Wolf, Torchwood, Vote Saxon, etc. Well, those are overarching storyline too! Except they were done by Russell T. Davies, so they were different (and better executed, IMO). The overarching storylines now are of course done by Moffat, so they aren't as good, because he's crazy. So I totally agree with what you're saying. 

Holy long comment, Batman! I really let myself get carried away, didn't I? Someone should have stopped me. 

TL;DR - Split season: No
No two-parters: No
Jack Harkness: Yes yes yes
Daleks: Yes
Overarching storylines: Yes, but improve

Basically I agreed with everything OP said and made a long comment to do it. Sorry you guys.

Wanyama probably wont go for much more than £10m, maybe someone will be willing to risk £15m on him but the thing is, he plays in Scottish football. He looks great but there's no guarantee he could do it consistently in a big league. I think he probably would but clubs dont like to spend that much money on something which isnt necessarily a given.

Benteke a bit slower and less powerfull, but excellent technique, best with a ball at his feet and guarding the ball from defenders. Great for holding up play so a dominant side could play a high line.

This is very well said, if only more footy fans think like this, rationalize instead of taking the pitch forks out and just call everyone plastic who is not from the area or have any relations with the team. After all, IIRC half the PL teams are foreign owned with half the squad from other countries. Even national teams have players from foreign countries. By the common mindset's standards, teams like Man utd, Man city, Arsenal, Liverpool and etc. are plastic teams and players like Deco, Malouda, Hargreaves even to a certain degree Subotic and others are plastic national players.

£390 a month for 25 years will total £117000. That doesn't even cover the capital so I fail to see how it could be paying off any of the capital at all.

If it's an interest only mortgage you're getting a rate of 2.7%. That seems to me to be very low. Are you on a 'professional' mortgage where the payments gradually increase as your salary supposedly increases?

Even if your mortgage paid off the capital and interest at the end of the mortgage you would still have to start paying a fee on the government loan after 5 years which starts at 1.75% of the loan amount and increases by RPI+1% for each year onwards. By the end of the mortgage if RPI had been a steady 2% over the term, your annual fee payments for the equity loan would be £1411.

Even if you accept that you won't own the house at the end of the term and will have to hand the keys back but reckon that is still a better proposition than renting over that period you will still have to pay back the government loan and will have still had to pay the fees over the term.

As I say, maybe you've not told us something that's relevant and I'm making a mountain out of a molehill.

Secondly how would the cap be applied and who would cap it?

My girlfriend has just wrapped up a year-long internship in heritage, being told that was the only way to gain access to a proper, decent job in the heritage industry. 

Consider that her PSW visa expired in January.
We have to have a combined income of £19k (from what I can tell) for six months prior to application, and she has to be personally earning the ""minimum threshold of support"", which again I think is the whole £19k for twelve months prior to the application as well.

Any secondary jobs I take or raises I might get don't count towards the combined income unless I've had that rate of pay for the six months.

I could make it up with savings, but the minimum threshold they count towards your support of application is £16,000, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get half of that if I sold every material item I own.

I guess in our situation, it's less about the complicated financial requirements, and more that time is against us.

We have a chance of getting a partnership / settlement visa (i think) if I get a raise or she gets a job in the next three weeks, then if we apply in December time, hopefully we'll make it. But we've got to scrape £600 - £1000 in time to pay the application fee, and hope that there isn't any bit of writing on the 20-something page application form which is slightly illegible, or any bit of the tonne of supporting evidence we have to provide is incorrect, or that we've interpreted any part of the confusing 50-page legal document about if we're eligible wrong, or they'll just go *""lol nope we're keeping the fee though bye""*.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;They aren't going to invade and occupy however, and aren't trying to prepare public opinion for an invasion - which is what I thought you meant.

I haven't heard anyone advocating for that. The aim is to topple governments and they don't need troops on the ground to achieve that, just look at Libya. 

The 'rebels' are the new proxy military force which are often [trained by the west](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/10/us-syria-crisis-rebels-usa-idUSBRE9290FI20130310) and sent in to do their bidding.

&gt;Although I don't think China and Russia are so much blocking anything, as being used as a convenient explanation why real intervention can't be made

There were a lot of efforts over a year ago to get a [UN resolution](http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2011/10/05/russia-china-veto-un-syria-resolution/) going that would lead to a no-fly zone which is how it went in Libya but Russia and China blocked it. They gave up with the resolutions and went for the clandestine methods of helping the 'rebels'.

&gt;the US is quite capable of ignoring the UNSC if it decides it is in their interests.

This is all about perception, as I said they don't want it to appear to be a neo-con style forced regime change. The US has moral cover by doing overt measures like no-fly zone bombing campaigns through the UN, going it alone wouldn't reflect the humanitarian democratic rhetoric. 

They want to achieve a goal but do it in such a way that it looks like an organic toppling of Assad so everyone will be more accepting of the outcome. ",0,1369909516,null,0,false,0,ca8q49i,t3_1f9zw3,t1_ca8q49i,t1_ca8puwk,null,1430986012,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The point however is that one of the most amazing things about computers and the internet is the ability to which it empowers and enables even severely disabled people.

He can barely grip a pen these days, let alone write an essay to the DWP explaining his situation. However he's perfectly capable of (slowly, but surely) using his one working finger to press keys on a computer, and when even that bit of him stops working, there are speech recognition programs which  mean he'll still be able to read and write emails, go online, etc etc.

If he could fill in an application form online he'd be perfectly able and willing to do so. What he can't do, however, is fill in the same form when it's printed on paper, which means he has to dictate all his answers to a helper.

Then they kicked him a few more times - to make sure there wasn't an invisible gun? Did they suddenly have an eyesight problem? He's shown prown and his limbs spread at this point - there's no weapon in easy reach. 

(Meanwhile there are other officers with weapons trained on him at all times - see 1:29)

That's the situation *we all can see from the video*. It's not hypothetical - he was knocked down and was complying with his arms and palms spread before being kicked.

1. America commercialised the auto-mobile that to this day still pollutes the world more than factories.

4. Without reparation America would not have survived the wall st. crash. You see, Reparations made Germany take out vast loans and deals so when the crash occurred in 1929 the USA called in all the repayments that Germany owed them, so Germany dug itself a hole and America was burying Germany. 

5. Are you forgetting that English people were constantly invaded during  BC - AD. Where we were the subjects of genocide.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Most the country!!?? Who have you been speaking too?
&gt;Most home owners don't.

Most home owners don't have mortgages or care about interest rates other than how the low interest rates are affecting their savings. Remember most home owners have already paid off their mortgages and are now saving for retirement or are already retired, only a small percentage of home owners actually have mortgages (less than 20%), and these people tend to be younger people (20 to 45), who are now a minority in the population.

Within 10 years most of the country will be elderly like in Japan, and they won't care about mortgages even if they own homes. They care that all the money they saved for their retirement is only earning 0.5% interest, and the government will be **forced** to raise interest rates so they don't become dependant on the state for aid. We've seen this happen time and time again, the government policy is already being redirected to cater for an ageing population, from more investment in elderly health services, to less investment in schools and services for younger people.

You have to understand, if most of the UK population is going to be retired or approaching retirement soon, then that means a small young population is going to have to support a large old population, and the best way to do that is to raise interest rates and allow the old people to look after themselves, not burden the young people with more debt and more taxes to pay for all the things that the elderly need, this doesn't work. If the old are only earning 0.5% interest on their savings, which is less than inflation, that's going to cause us massive issues in 10 years time and will screw over the country big time. 

Most economists including the Bank of England in their annual reports, agree that UK interest rates will be going to slowly work their way up to 8% over the next 7 years, so if you take out a mortgage now, then be prepared to pay that before long, but don't worry, you won't be having to pay 16% interest like your grandparents did.

If you are combatting the threat of a firearm, you don't do things half arsed. 

In answer to your original question ""...is it commonplace to give the suspect a good kicking when taking them down? It's right there on video at 1:26."" 
I'll ask you, are firearms commonplace? Would you rather the police shot him? Would you rather the suspect had the slight possibility of a few cracked ribs? Or would you rather he died? Or would you rather risk an officer getting shot? The scenario where the officers are able to control and restrain an armed suspect with kicks is a much better one than anyone getting shot. 

When faced with a threat such as a gun with only the limited factors that these officers were given, you do not want to be taking on the threat with a cushioned blow. You deal with it as hard and as quickly as you can reasonably do. Kicking the suspect until he is COMPLETELY restrained and controllable under handcuffs is a much preferable circumstance than anyone getting shot.

Why won't it stop dealers pushing it? If they've not got any to sell to addicts, they've not got any to push.

There is no reason to remove the stick domestically either, in fact it's more justified because you're far less likely to catch people selling to stave off withdrawals.

The whole ""I'm the last of my race"" thing is getting tired. I wouldn't mind finding out that Matt Smith actually regenerates into John Hurt's Doctor by dying as a result of John Hurt's Doctor interfering in his own lifeline. 

John Hurt's Doctor would have done this in order to do something that I am *really* hoping will happen: the return of the Time Lords. Not like the crap they did a few seasons back, but a proper return of the Time Lords. 

I can see John Hurt's Doctor only living through the 50th Anniversary special, and dying at the end, possibly at the same time as Matt Smith's Doctor, with Matt Smith's Doctor becoming John Hurt's Doctor, stealing Matt Smith's Tardis and traveling back in time, while John Hurt's regenerated Doctor tries to follow him in the now dead John Hurt's Tardis.

Of course, the presence of the returned Time Lords would probably cause some issues, preventing Doctor #13 from chasing #12 back into #11's timeline.

I'm also excited about the idea of an older Doctor again. All of these young Doctors lately make his character seem more like Benjamin Button. Before you know it, the Doctor is going to be played by a freaking 8-year-old.

But that's just me. I know that most people seem to love the hipster Doctor, the youthful angst, and the constant return of characters like River Song and Strax.

This theory may seem far-fetched, but it actually fits in pretty well with the other anniversary specials (10th and 20th), both of which involved multiple doctors crossing timelines and major Time Lord story lines.

true,MathFabMathonwy,,LLanelli,"While I know dem feels, the diminished countryside he is lamenting here is also a man-made construct. Sure, the coniferous trees are foreign, and I've personally always hated them, but, before the coming of humans to the island, Britain was tree-covered from end to end, from seashore to treeline on the mountains.

He may have a point about the lack of action, but surely too hasty action can itself prove a blight, if not enough forethought is applied. Some solutions bring even larger problems in their wake.

I would also add that I find the term 'conservation' to be somewhat dubious. It seems to fly in the face of the reality, in which change is the only constant. Surely we should be talking about 'husbandry', whereby we minimise the (detrimental) footprint of human activity. But, do we really want to reintroduce wolves and bears into Britain?

It would be a much easier sell if the idea was a treatment program that has a goal of removing the addiction rather than just maintaining it indefinitely. And since we live in a democracy you do have to sell these ideas to the public, otherwise sooner or later someone will come along and kill the entire program, taking us back to square one.
