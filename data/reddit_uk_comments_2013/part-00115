true,michaelisnotginger,cnty-scotland,"Scottish-Italian, will deep fry your pizza","Ok so you're looking for internships/work placements in something different to her degree subject. Ok. I went through something like this last year. My advice is

1) read through the cover letters you're sending and make sure try really big up what experience she has working with peoples/groups/societies. These will show the competences that they want - high module grades help but only to an extent. If she's not doing this already most universities will have finance societies/societies that need marketing/business teams in which she can get involved or challenges like a university apprentice team

2) get feedback from where you are unsuccessful

3) really brush up on maths skills and basic things like knowing how to use excel etc. Boring but many employers have set images of students who aren't doing business and this can help

4) i would also really narrow down on what part of business he's interested in and focus on that. Don't blanket bomb applications

He solves problems through talking and he’s proud to be a science-loving, socially awkward geek. He’s the hero of boys and girls. But most of all he shows boys that violence and aggression won’t get them what they want. Being clever, not conforming, being kind, talking – these are the ways to be a hero.

The Doctor isn't the only non-violent ""superhero"" male role model. Sherlock Holmes. Also, the Doctor is the hero of boys *and* girls. Can he not be that if he's female? He shows boys that violence and aggression aren't the answer but he would also show girls that you can be smart and like science, you don't have to conform and act like a ditz to win people over.

&gt;My daughter will love the Doctor whether he’s a boy or a girl – River Song and Amy Pond are her heroes too - and I hope she still feels the same long after One Direction fade into another dimension, but being a feminist and calling for him to become a woman is missing a massive point.

You have to travel and fight for those shitty little pub shows and hope that someone somewhere takes an interest, you've gotta jump on the big indie tours that take place, you've gotta go through the blood sweat and tears to get famous.

X Factor and BGT takes away any independence or learning experience that a good band/singer needs, they tell them what they can or can't do, that's just wrong. And at the end of the road, all you can say is you were once on the X Factor and people will just smile and go 'oh cool, what're you doing now? Hairdressing? That's nice.'

Student loans are easy to get for UK students, I think it should be the same for foreigners, you do it at gov.org.uk (our main government website).

Do some research into how UK courses are viewed by American employers and universities. A friend of mine is currently doing an MEng and wants to do a PhD in Canada but she will have to do an extra years course before the Uni will accept that she is the same level as students who just graduated with an MEng there. They can go straight to PhD but she can't.

On the more fun end of things you can drink at the age of 18. Your lifestyle at Uni will probably vary mostly on if you choose to go to a Uni with a separate campus or not.

Watches x factor, pop idol, the other one, and all this time she is starting to hate these smimey judges and ultra formulaic, cruddy, base level tv. And ofcourse who ushered in this particular brand of tv? Simon effin Cowell. 

So she waits... bides her time...aces violin school... applies for a position through the shows production company... returns phonecalls... stalks the show... pictures of simon cowell ....targetised on her walll.... trains with boiled eggs at first... lands the job.... starts going hardcore, uses raw eggs now... 5 days till the show...baddumm ... badummm.... badabummmm.

Ofcourse getting past seciruty was easy... im a violinist... people trust violinist. Many a time i have seen musicians.. the organised types... not the hippy types... and they look trustable, dependable...

From then on it was just a matter of biding her time...'soon cowell..i shall rebel against thy tyranny... i shall take revenge upon thee ,  for all those like me, against whom you have commit a lytanny of sensory crimes...invading ears and minds with low class music and low class musicians'

So where were we... oh.. yes...she has done well. She has been told she will on stage in huge performance by whoever those guys in the video were.

This seems to be quite hard to get across to American fans, who seem to expect that you just knock something down and build a bigger and better stadium, as is the case across America and the NFL.

London is an old city and its history including its sporting venues mean a lot to the fans who go to the games, rather than sitting in their onesie watching a live stream off the internet somewhere.

The Emirates is a wonderful stadium but it is devoid of any real home support atmosphere - there are no ends behind the goal - many of the Arsenal fans agree with this and most would pine for the glory days of Highbury.

Arsenal have won nothing since moving there and this says a lot.  No team fears going to the Emirates, in fact, it has the opposite effect, it simply makes them play up - to play their best exhibition football.

All of this likely falls on deaf ears, the excuses are 

(1) it will cost too much to re-develop The Bridge

(2) SB is prime real estate and will make lots of money when sold

(3) Our owner wants a 60,000 stadium and all the benefits of increased corporate sponsorship that comes with this.

Personally, it will be a shame.  You lose a big piece of the clubs history and let us talk about the fortress scenario again.

Arsene Wenger is the only manager to have completed a Premier season unbeaten.  It is a remarkable achievement.

But before he did this George Graham won the league in 1990/1991 with 83 points and conceding only 18 goals.

He would have beat Wenger's record but Tony Adams had gone to jail for drink driving and Arsenal's back four were weakened.

Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-1 at Stamford Bridge.  The only team to beat them that season.

We finished 11th that year.

Nice ticket snub here.

true,tachyons22,null,null,"I'm an American student doing her undergrad in the UK. It's pretty different to American unis in a lot of ways. 

First off, some differences in the pre-university phase. In the UK, they have primary (elementary), secondary (middle + first half of high school), then A levels/sixth form/college. College lasts for 2 years and instead of having to take English/calculus/painting/chemistry they take 3-4 classes that get them ready for the field they want to go into. So say you want to do chemistry, you'll take chemistry, maths, physics, and a language. They also have BTEC which is like vocational schools in America but different. Anyway, when you get close to graduating you'll get predicted grades, that is the prediction of your final grades. If you're pretty good it'll be like AAA, which is what universities like to see. When you look at entry requirement pages for courses in the UK, you'll see AAA, AAB, ABB, etc. So don't think it's something totally weird.

Now onto what they'll want to see from you. As an American, they'll want to see a 3.0+ GPA, plus SAT I with 800+ in each subject, PLUS 2-3 APs in the relevant subjects (so physics and calculus if you want to do physics or engineering) with grades of 4+ OR 2-3 SAT II subject tests in relevant subjects. So aim for that!

Additionally, when you go to university you'll have to know what you want to do. You **cannot** transfer courses or unis. Technically, you can, but you'll probably have to start all over, plus get a new visa. Believe me, I'm in the process of doing that and it is not fun in any way shape or form. So when you apply, you'll get 5 choices and I'd suggest using all 5. You can only write one personal statement that all 5 will get, so make sure they're all the same course and not applying for physics at UCL but history at Edinburgh. You get the picture.

Onto finances. Tuition usually starts around £11,000 ($16,700), but most places are around the £14,000 ($21,000) mark. Don't forget, this is for 3 years, not 4. Additionally, you need to have what's called 'maintenance.' This is money that you will use to support you. The border agency (UKBA) says that if you're studying in greater London, you'll have to have £9,000 ($14,000), but anywhere else in the country it's only £7,200 ($11,000). You need these funds when you apply for your visa, but the visa lasts for your full course of study and the funds will only be for that year. This is not an exaggeration by the way, you will spend that much in accommodation and expenses (at least outside of London, I couldn't imagine how expensive it is in the city). So you're looking at needing $32,000 for your first year.

How will you get this money? Well you're only allowed to apply for loans in the country that you reside in and have citizenship in, so American loans. You can also do scholarships, but there are very few offered to undergraduate Americans.

If you have any more questions about anything involving universities in the UK from an American perspective, feel free to ask!

I realise that the club was founded with the ground and has over a hundred years of history there. Osgood's ashes under the penalty spot makes it pretty much sacred ground. I'm also an international fan, and I realise how frustrating it must be to have me and others like me be willing to move when there has been so much history there, when the club and the ground are so linked. 

I think for the club to realise it's aims though, to be successful on the pitch   long term, requires success off the pitch - and that means global growth to support that on the pitch success. Of course it's of paramount importance to keep the clubs identity in any such transition, but I think at the end of the day, there is more to the club and it's history  than the stadium.

&gt;theories

*To answer your question, my personal theory hinges on the implication that the Silence are unable to advance technology on their own (for whatever reason) and must use other civilizations to do it for them.  This can be seen in The Impossible Astronaut when it is hinted at that the Silence influenced the space race in order to get a hold of the space suit.  

This, along with the ship in both episodes looking very much like a TARDIS, makes me think that the Silence influenced the building of the TARDIS itself (e.g. they essentially *started* the Time Lords).  This would likely involve a lot of wibbly-wobblying with timelines, but seems very much like something the show would do.  As it wasn't followed up in Season 6, it seems even less likely, but I still hold to it.",0,1370745263,null,0,1370745820,0,caf1eih,t3_1fxvvm,t1_caf1eih,t1_caev4ks,null,1430876712,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;No, it's not.

Yes it is.

&gt;Capitalism is a game, the point of which is to accumulate as much wealth as possible, regardless of the needs of others.

I see where you are coming from with your post, but your analysis misses several crucial components of ""the game"".

&gt;Government's role is to take the winnings from the game, and distribute them among the people that didn't get enough cards so that they can continue to be part of the game

Government is an essential component of the game - indeed without government, the capitalist game becomes impossible.  The ""winnings"" from the game, the ""surplus"" is actually taken by capitalists - be they land owners, industrial capitalists, financial capitalists or whatever; in today's world most commonly by the handful of people on the Boards of the worlds' largest corporations and the handful of people who control those corporations by means of majority share-ownership. Those are the people who determine how the surplus is distributed, subject to an element of modulation by the governments of the world (ostensibly democratic or otherwise).  Naturally, there is a healthy overlap between capitalists and government, more in some countries than others, and always capitalists exercise a high degree of control over governments by various means.  Government is the means by which capitalists ensure the game is always rigged in their favour and the table is tilted sufficiently to ensure wealth accumulates in their hands.  The latest figures out of the US, for example, show that the top 1% owns 30% of the wealth, the next 9% owns the next 37%, and the bottom 50% of the US population own roughly 4% of total wealth (financial, capital, land, stocks/shares, etc.)

&gt;if you don't play the game, you die, btw

And this is part of the rigged game, it's not a natural state of affairs.  If you go back to pre enclosure UK, most families had their own land and access to the commons.  It was tough, but they could eke out a sustenance living without having to work for another as the feudal system began to collapse.  The historical record is full of the concerns of the new agricultural and industrial capitalists as to how difficult it was to secure labour at a ""sensible"" price because the working classes had enough to eat and wanted to ""be lazy"" unless they were given a proper incentive to work for another.  This is the reason they got their governments to introduce raft after raft of legislation to push people off of the commons, to take away their lands, to prevent them from moving freely around the country or from freely combining with other workers to seek the best prices for their labour.  Despite what they taught you in ""Social and Economic History"" at school, only by ensuring that without submitting to wage slavery they'd starve and die from exposure was it possible to make the disease-ridden cities and deathtrap factories an attractive option.

Consider what the intervening period, with all its easy access to cheap and abundant energy and incredible, previously inconceivable advances to technology, would have delivered in terms of lifestyle if things had remained distributed instead of being concentrated into factories under the centralised control of corporate economic planners due to the dictates of steam power and Taylorist mass production.  If only they could have held off until the coming of electricity, which required no such centralisation and bureaucratic control and could have revolutionised cottage production. The fundamental promise of capitalism has proved a big lie.  With every improvement in efficiency or technology the same carrot is dangled - more freedom from drudgery and unnecessary labour, more time for leisure and personal improvement.  Yet, they've never delivered: we work longer hours now than in previous times.  Indeed, the profit motive will never let this happen whilst the surplus is under private control of those who don't labour for it.  They will always want to squeeze out more work from others for their own benefit.  We're not even materially better off in many ways, certainly not if you factor in the achievements which should have been possible considering the huge advances of technology and the incredible amount of cheap energy which have been consumed in the process.  The proportion of our meagre earnings consumed by necessaries continues to ramp upwards.  We're distracted instead with cheap plastic crap produced in the developing world, whose ruthless exploitation has kept the worst effects of capitalism from our door thus far.  But perhaps not much longer...

&gt;It's the government, who is elected by the people, to represent the people, who has to take care of the people. 

Wishful thinking, even in those countries with a modicum of democracy like our own.  Look at the disparities of wealth I alluded to before (using the US as an example - but we're not far behind).  Would any government whose role was ""to take care of the people"" allow such disparities?  Their role is to serve capitalist interests generally, but also to defuse the direct conflict between capital and labour and occasionally save capitalism from itself, it's true.

&gt; If the government isn't doing this, then we need a new fucking government.

I can appreciate why you say this, and it's long been the cry of the dispossessed, but government is part of the problem, it's not the solution.  Government will always serve the elite - even under the extreme State capitalism of the USSR, as the anarchists warned it would, the State still served elite interests - they just traded private capitalist bosses for State capitalist communist party bosses.

&gt; And if none of them want to do it, then we need a new game. Perhaps one that involves sharing and co-operation instead of trying to fuck everyone over at every opportunity.

Basically, the way admissions to universities in the UK works is that UK students take exams called A-levels, for which they are given predicted grades with A* being the highest. Universities set different entry requirements based on these A-levels, for instance at my university my course (what we would call a major) might require A*AA. If you get an unconditional offer, you're in no matter what grades you actually make. If you get a conditional offer and you make the grades, you're in. Otherwise, it gets tricky.

As a foreign student, universities will have different standards for you. For instance, they will typically require a certain score on the ACT/SAT, some SAT II subject tests, and a certain GPA in high school. Then you'll have to apply using [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/undergraduate). 

However, might I suggest an alternative? You might want to think about simply doing an international year or semester in the UK while doing a degree here in the US. This might give you a taste of what it's actually like to live and study in Britain. I can assure you, there is a fairly high amount of culture shock involved - more than you'd think given our shared language.

If that doesn't sound appealing to you or if you're just heart set on going to university in Britain then more power to you. I know that I couldn't fathom making such a change to my life at 18, and you're still in 10th grade. Don't mean to sound condescending at all, I'm just trying to offer some perspective. 

Anyway, if none of that has deterred you then I encourage you to consult some [league tables](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2013/jun/04/university-guide-computer-sciences-it), though they should be taken with a pinch of salt. Find some unis that look good to you and check their requirements, then, when it comes time you can apply through UCAS. Good luck with everything and let me know if you have any more questions!

That final scene went through at least half a dozen revisions, and at one point he even considered having Rose and Doctor #2 be trapped together on the TARDIS instead of Donna, so that there would be more time for them to interact and have a basis for the final departure.

Instead they opted for the answer we get - that Rose is happy having chosen Doc2, because he was able to express to her what Doc1 could not - and having it unspoken, so that each of us can decide in our secret hearts just what he said to her in that whisper, lets you decide, as the viewer, just how happy she is.

What's missing is a scene that was removed - but that RTD has said he still thinks really happened - where Doc1 and Donna give Rose and Doc2 a chunk of TARDIS coral, to grow their own TARDIS, and the instructions on how to speed that growth along and make it so that they can be ""The Doctor, in the TARDIS, with Rose just like it should be.""

You're right, I'm sorry, that was written as if it were directed at you, but not directed at you. 

It's not about ""crushing men"", none of them are so obvious or bombastic in their efforts. To them it's a black and white case of helping women by taking from men. ""Men have too much, so we take to make it equal."" 

&gt;  Also, in what way are men lower? I'm honestly curious.

It's widely known that men have it worse socially. If I hit a woman who is literally assailing me without any provocation, I'm a monster and she's a hero. The context is irrelevant to the public. If I get a divorce with my wife, the court will see me as a monster and give the children to her (I've seen this happen in action personally so many times, literally in the court room, literally watching a judge hand out this sentence). If I like something ""girly, I'm instantly a ""[swears removed to accommodate ridiculous subreddit rules]"". If a girl likes something manly, good for her, she should do that, men should accept her, what a pioneer!

Outdated ideas of chivalry and the fact that men are physically stronger means of course people are going to look down on you if you slap a woman. If a woman slaps a man there is the idea that the man did something wrong. Perhaps this is mainly because a woman cannot usually physically subdue a man so any motive she has in slapping him would be out of offense rather than intent to abuse.

As for giving children to the woman, this is also because of gender roles. Women are supposed to be the mothers and all that ""maternal instinct"" crap. I think that the idea that mothers are better caretakers hurts men who want to be fathers, hurts children who are not getting the best possible care, and hurts women who don't want to be mothers but are pressured to become one. Well really, gender roles hurt everybody.

If you like something girly you will be mocked because it is shameful for a man to be like a girl. If a girl likes something manly it is ok because being a man is cool.

If ""local"" imples ""non-chain"", then these two phrases could be replaced with ""non-chain bookstore"" and ""non-chain Waterstone"" -- one of these makes way more sense than the other (hint: it's not the one you keep saying is more correct).

Now, I'm not going to argue what's ""right"" in England, because it's QUITE true that UK English and US English have differing colloquial trends, and maybe this is one of those weird things that just doesn't make sense when you break it down, but that's just how it is.  We in the states have plenty of those--I'd assume that every language does.  But hey, if you REALLY want to make it totally clear, just say ""my local Waterstone bookstore"", right?  But that's redundant, in just the same way as naming the bookstore is.

Not trying to say who's ""right"" or ""wrong"", just hoping to paint that perspective.  It's redundant and unnecessary to specify the name when it doesn't really add anything to the context.  The point of the post was that this was found in a bookstore, nobody gives a good damn which bookstore, or if its a chain or not.  It matters naught.

true,Silesius16thCentury,null,null,"Torres isn't going anywhere. No-one will pay him what we do, and it seems he is a big commercial asset to us. (I think there was an article posted here a while back that his shirt sales alone make his initial 50 million pound investment not so horrendous after all). 

Jose will give him a chance, and if he doesn't impress he will be relegated to backup striker. I can't see us exiling him like we did Malouda. So if Torres wants a drastic paycut and regular football with a lesser team he'll leave, if not he won't.

What the Torres defenders need to understand is that his critics aren't saying he is a bad guy or doesn't try or hasn't shown some improvement. What we're saying is that we can get someone better. Has he scored some big goals for us? Yes. But are you really saying that a Lewandowski or a Cavani or Lukaku as first choice aren't going to score big goals for us? Does he also provide assists? Yes. But is another top class striker going to somehow be incapable of drifting wide and setting up the likes of Mata to score? 

Do we play a style that doesn't favour strikers? Yes. But does that mean that any striker we get would also score the same number of goals that Torres did? I'm sure we could at least convert a few more of those admittedly fewer chances. That in itself could put us 1-0 in games with a good defence where this year we were chasing lesser teams in the second half.

Didn't he score that wonderful goal against Barcelona? Yes. But a one on one against the keepter with a whole half to yourelf, shouldn't we expect most strikers to score that goal? Would you feel comfortable with Torres in that situaion again if we atually needed that goal to progress in the CL against quality opposition? 

What Torres has unfortunately also shown is a lack of willingness to shoot, a habit of being physically bullied off the ball, a first touch that brings attacking movements to an abrupt end, a tendency to lose the ball to minimal defensive pressure - areas in which other strikers are, simply put, better. 

I have no problems with Torres staying as part of the squad, but am looking forward to what Mourinho will do with our sriking options, and if Torres doesn't work out, I have no issue with us bringing someone else in and relegating Torres to second or third choice striker.",0,1370764268,null,0,false,0,caf5tzn,t3_1fxc0f,t1_caf5tzn,t3_1fxc0f,null,1430874624,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

No. It was literally just a crack. Was River Song's identity really that ""surprising""? No. It was pretty much shoved in our faces as soon as anything hinted towards a baby started happening.

I'm not saying he isn't capable of turning this on its head. But in the past 3 Series he hasn't been one to blatantly do a plot twist from literally nowhere. He puts it right out there as obvious as the color of the wall beside you. And then makes people overanalyze things until the most obvious solution seems like some kind of shocking, stunning revelation.

Everything presented to us so far is what is going to end up being true. ""The Doctor"" has had 11 incarnations that we all know. One to Eleven. The entities that used the name ""The Doctor"". It has never been stated that this Time Lord we follow didn't have other incarnations with different names as well. This is what John Hurt's presence confirms. Its not some kind of clever twist. He's just a 12th regeneration with a different name finally confirmed. That Time Lords can change identities/namesakes as well as their visual appearance. The Doctor has existed for eleven incarnations. John Hurt's named Time Lord existed for one incarnation (let's call him ""The Hurt""). Which means John Hurt's named Time Lord can exist for a second incarnation, The Second Hurt, in the future to make the show feel ""fresh and new"" when he doesn't go by The Doctor for a regeneration. Which does add a new layer of ""what entity of this Time Lord are we going to get next regeneration..."" Unless they pull the obvious and have 10 and 11 watch The Hurt redeem himself in the 50th and just decide to call him ""The Doctor without a number"".

And before we all then begin to go crazy over ""but if he's gone through 12 regenerations, he only has one left!"" They've purposely ignored that entire principle for a reason. They said it was a bad decision back in the day to make into continuity so there's no doubt in my mind the Time Lords will return in the next few Series and a new Lord President will conveniently give him a new set of regenerations like The Master got.",0,1370766934,null,0,false,0,caf67h1,t3_1fyw99,t1_caf67h1,t3_1fyw99,null,1430874376,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

There are 2 ""likely"" scenarios. 

1) Someone snuck the eggs past the pre-show screening, into the stage area, then managed to get on stage, in the middle of a live performance. (It has been suggested the the thrower is in the orchestra, answering some of these questions). 

2) The thrower was arranged, and was able to get to the stage, on a live show unhindered as part of something of a media hoohah. 

Both are plausable, and in terms of logical simplicity, (and ignoring the Orchestra link for now) the 2nd of the two models is by far the most plausible.  

Even given the suggestion that the Violin player was the egg thrower, and thus was able to easily get the eggs into the studio (i) she would still need to get past the stage security and (2) one has to consider her thinking in this - is she likely to potentially ruin any future spots with an orchestra if she has a reputation for grabbing the limelight. 

Both scenarios are unlikely, and in terms of logically simplicity, neither can be easily ranked as more likely than the other. I would still personally hedge for the setup over the career-suicidal violinist, but thats my opinion. There can be no logical inference as I have no where near enough facts to be able to draw an education conclusion on the relative likelihood of either event.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's not the type of immaturity I'm referring to. I mean more along the lines of the age that climbs trees, likes to look for and pick up bugs and lizards, find humor about gas and stuff funny(if you want to get stereotypical about young boys). It's certainly hard to relate to children in that phase for anyone that's not  young boy. That's the age where boys have zero interest in girls usually.

All your examples, except for possibly Adventure Time, and they're definitely more mature than that age. I suppose Spongebob could come close but there's certainly more to the show than just that. 

To be clearer, I'm talking early elementary school. By later elementary school, you start to mature a little. I'd range most of those examples as late elementary school or older in maturity level.

Of course, everyone matures at a different levels but speaking generally. 

Ren &amp; Stimpy is more the age I'm referring(that's actually an adult cartoon but has the potty humor I'm referring to). And of course, like you said, there's obvious exceptions. I'm sure a lot of girls did watch it but it's obviously more aimed at a primarily male audience. That's not to say things women *cant* enjoy that show or humor, of course they can and there's nothing wrong with it, it just might be harder to get into without feeling alienated. 

Now, this isn't discrimination. Shows are made with demographics in mind and it goes by age group, lifestyle and sometimes gender. That's how they find an audience and make money. You want to have an audience that will get really into it. The safe bet is to pick a reliable audience and cater to it. Cross-appeal, whether purposeful or accidental, is always a great addition too so it's not a strict thing but it's obvious they cater. For example, WWE has done away with it's questionable content to attract young children and Star Trek has done away with social commentary to attract more mainstream audience. It presents a challenge for older males to get into WWE or trekkies to get into Abrams movies but of course, there's still people who overcome the hurdles and enjoy it but if you ask them, they'll most likely admit they'd prefer it to cater to them instead as they don't like some elements included so it could cater to a different demographic.

&gt;It sounds to me like your real beef are the laws about drugs. Not the law as such. Maybe you are a habitual drug user and you feel that with the legalisation of drugs would make your life freer and more convenient. Maybe you feel by breaking these laws that you're standing your ground in some way.

First you take to attacking me and why I'm making my arguments instead of how I'm making them. You are attempting to discredit and undermine a person because you can't discredit or undermine their points. This is a sign that discourse has broken down in any debate.

&gt;I fail to see what the sex life of gay men has to do with the legalisation of drugs - the two are not the same.

Why are they not the same? I've explained my point and your answer is ""I don't agree"" but you don't bother to tell me why you don't agree. I'm going to have to presume that if you don't explain your self it means you can't.

&gt;If you are trying for the legalisation of drugs (why else would you be so hurt by Tulisa's situation?) I can only imagine that you are white and middle-class as this is the demographic that could only benefit from the legalisation of drugs.

There's many reason to find what is happening here reidiculous and again you are making statements without backing them up and this one is on deeply stupid (and oddly telling about your as a person) that I'm not even going to bother touching it until you bother to explain your self.

&gt;Go ahead, break the law, stand your ground. I couldn't care less (my drug days are long behind me) but the fact is that Tulisa did break the law recently.

Ah so you have a superiority complex. That explains a lot. Yes she broke a law, that's not been the point of this debate, you think that if the law is the law then you have to respect that law even if it's stupid and I think that's silly and explained why society has never worked like that with examples and everything! you just keep saying you are right.

Talking of which

&gt;Your connection between her case and the sex life of gay men or traffic violations even is weak at best. Whatever the drug laws may be in the US have nothing to do with the law in the UK. Society is far from changing quickly in the UK - no, actually, it is! You're right. But not in the direction you were hoping for.

Why is it weak at best? I was point out that laws change to adapt to social norms and if social norms about drugs change laws change, which is exactly what is happen in the US which is why that was a relevant point to make. To say the US is not the UK is fine but if we are looking actual factual evidence on the effects of different drug policies the only thing we can do is look at places where they are different. Do you think it's stupid to go to Portugal to study their drug policies? Because that's what our government has done, a government in which we've had large cross party committees call for radical reform of our drug policies only a few short years after their leading scientist on the matter lost his job for calling for the same. Things are changing and they are in the direction I hope, I'm again able to offer actual evidence for that instead of just making a statement (see how that works?) and again I must just presume you can't back up your points.

I think Johnson is ridiculously under rated outside of LFC circles. Going forward, I think there are very few full backs in the PL that are better than him. He is a very clever footballer, and links really well with Suarez. He was our best player (behind Suarez) for a little under two thirds of the season before his form disappeared quite alarmingly. He was completely invisible in the last few games of the season. 

I think the dip can be explained by the fact that he has never played so many games in a season before. Credit must go to the medical staff for keeping him injury free, but he really looked liked he could do with a early holiday. He played 23, 28, 25 and 29 matches in the previous seasons.

Also, most people don't remember that he played out of position at left back for a large part of the season.

Ok, now this is from the rational part of my head: I think we need decent competition for the RB position with Glen Johnson.
I also think the next season should be his last for the club. He’ll be 30 at the end of next season and his pace will suffer. Hopefully we get a decent replacement for him long before then. Also Ryan McLaughlin has been excellent for the reserves before his unfortunate injury and hopefully has a go in the team.

But the turnovers stat, and less so the final pass accuracy of 70%, are both areas that sum up my biggest issue with Johnson this season - once we're in the final third and trying to break a team down, he's not as effective as a fullback of his attacking quality should be. One of the biggest areas for improvement for Liverpool, in an attacking sense, is patience - and Johnson's a big culprit of impatience, often taking shots straight at packed defences, or crossing to an empty box. These were issues that really showed up in the final third of the campaign, where his form dropped off.

Despite tailing off near the end, I thought he had a very good season, and he's certainly not defensively suspect in the way he first was when joining Liverpool. The above quibbles are areas I'd like to see him improve, that's all.

There's rumours he might leave because of his high wages - as much as I wouldn't like it, I can understand it, just because of how many other options we're developing in that spot.

To think that every penny donated to charities or from government bodies goes towards the stated causes is simply naive.

By 'transparent institutions' I'm talking about our well documented welfare state, where almost every penny is accounted for.

It's also through corruption and inequality that countries like India and Brazil still need foreign aid. In Brazil's case, they have a bigger economy than ours, but no means of wealth re-distribution. In India's case they have the money but not the priorities, instead opting to fund a space programme than feed their hungry.

I agree that I would always like to see improvement in how aid is targeted, so that the maximum number of people can be helped.

Our generosity as a nation is very cheap for each individual and makes a huge positive difference around the world. Its one of the few thing's that we do on the international scene that garners near universal support.

I thought you were some manic theorist claiming a secret world government had been established, whereas when you used ""conspiracy"" you mean tacit or explicit co-operation between various special interest groups.

But here are my closing arguments. On the media I would argue that the most likely cause in failure to report financial scandal or come out against certain political decisions has a lot to do with journalistic timidity. In order to survive and make a profit they do not need to stir up controversy, their money comes from subscriptions not individual sales (which would incentivise the release of dramatic stories). Indeed by releasing controversial news stories they can damage themselves significantly, either losing readers who support a certain political measure (your example of the Iraq war is perfect here, at first there was widespread public support) or facing being sued for libel by the companies/individuals you upset (if we look at The Private Eye which often reports on corruption it is the most sued publication in British History and has nearly gone bankrupt several times). The incentives for reporting these scandals is not there.

The Rockerfeller quotes sound like standard self-aggrandising so while he certainly subscribes to those views they seem driven by a sense of his own importance (the tone clearly indicates he sees himself as a bit of a visionary). Yes these people attend Bilderberg but even amongst these people there is significant disagreement, and attending Bilderberg are many people rather sceptical of these ideas.

Finally when you complain about the evils of Western Civilisation remember that you yourself enjoy the benefits of the Western World them in the forms of the welfare state and representative democracy (which despite all its flaws is the best we can do for the moment). While these ideas were not all unique to the West to implement and create them we drew upon our own civilisation. When you praise indigenous cultures I would suggest that there is perhaps less inequality and corruption as resources are too scarce to support these things. There is less conflict because paucity of resources means that co-operation is a must for survival. I'm unsure about the Thailand, Tibet and Nepal aspect, but I would point out even before Europeans came oppressive hierarchies were in place.

So finally thank you for one of the most interesting discussions I've had in a while. While I still count myself as a supporter of the views I held at the start of the discussion you have made me more aware of the corruption engendered and other flaws. Nevertheless I remain a supporter on the grounds that this system has created wealth, which no matter the uneven distribution, has lifted millions out of poverty (admittedly not out of the goodness of it heart out of self-interest). Yes the inequalities and corruption that go with should be fought it is also a fact that if I support these institutions these things will exist and the best I can hope to do is minimise them.",0,1370780101,null,0,false,0,caf7nne,t3_1fq7lo,t1_caf7nne,t1_caekval,null,1430873694,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The problem is really the database that they had planned - which would store a lot of data that they don't really need, plus biometric data, and it would be envisaged that every time your ID is used (like in a shop to buy alcohol, tobacco, knives) then it would be scanned and recorded in the database that you bought X at Y at Z date/time. Then it'd be trivial to link it to your medical records and the NHS and then they could say ""you say you don't smoke or drink so why do you keep buying it?"" and refuse help or something, or perhaps the police could have a quick look and see that you bought some knives and use it to try and suggest that you're responsible for a knife-related crime.

The other problem was the cost. Billions is/was going to be spent on this. All they could have done is just got the DVLA to issue photocards that don't allow you to drive for a fraction of the cost.

Oh, and that the politicians couldn't find a use for it. Jacqui Smith's best justification for it was that it would make it easier to open a bank account. I didn't find it that hard to do last time, and it's not like I go and open a new account every day.

After a ton of backlash, the government decided that the ID card itself would not be compulsory, but anyone who gets one or renews their passport after a certain date would have their details and biometrics placed into that database.

I think on the whole people do care, but honestly, what can be done now? Everything is in place, the system is running. We'd all like to think we could change it but in actuality it's probably too late. They have the power, they have the will, the tech is in place and running. No one in their right mind would expect them to give it up without one hell of a fight (would anything less than serious civil disobedience be required to really make a change?). Petition your local MP all you want, ""security"" will/does take priority. 

So the common person is left with 3 options: 1, fight a fight on principle in which they risk losing everything to gain very little in terms of their day to day lives. 2, they take themselves out of the system by not using the digital media that is oh so easy to monitor, a kind of self imposed digital stone age (fwiw, for my money this our best option. You really don't want people spying on you? Stop using the tools they are using to do it). Or 3, they reluctantly accept that this is just the way shit works now and carry on regardless. 

Since most people just want to get through their day to day I don't find it surprising that option 3 is the most appealing. The intertnet and all the other media which is being used against us is such a large part of life that people can't give it up and the state is such a big and all invasive machine now that a fight to change it will require almost dismantling it. Case in point Reddit. Thousands of people complaining about being spied on but none of them willing to acknowledge that the easiest and most effective way to foil them is to simply switch off and tune out. The digital economy is worth billions, especially to the UK, if everyone refused to take part in it until appropriate safeguards were in place change would occur quickly. But we can't, people rely on it or have forgotten how to get along without it. So we ignore it.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"the difference isn't that much - Allen signed for £35k, Borini for £30k, Sterling for £30k. The average wage in the Championship is £4.5k per week - so stepping up to Liverpool they would be looking at £15-30k.

There is still a point there though, outside of the top players in the top teams most players in La Liga and Serie A are on low wages. Even Mkhitaryan is on 20k euro a week.

Compare that to the contracts we used to hand out to players - Carroll, Downing, Henderson even Maxi, Bellamy and Kuyt - we are able to both reduce our wage bill and improve the quality in our squad.

The best thing about our new contracts, and why we need to get rid of the remainder of the old ones is first we don't sign anybody on top first team wages anymore unless they are very proven. Even Suarez started out on £35k. Once the player establishes themselves in the first team then they get an increase (which Suarez has twice). No more large weekly payments for players that don't play and no more automatic increases.

This makes it a hell of a lot easier to offload flops, and a lot less financially straining. At one point two seasons ago we had £25M a year worth of wages of players that were not playing or sitting on the bench. Most of that is gone now. In the last 3 transfer windows the priority in moving players out has been based on the contracts they are on (this is outside of established players such as Gerrard, Johnson and Reina, obviously). I think this will continue for this next window until we are done with them. Personally I can't wait until we are done with the rest of the bad contracts since it opens up so much more opportunity - we can replace Downing with 2.5 Aspas or Allen like signings.

When you take Aspas' wages and transfer fee combined and amortize over a year it works out that his cost is £3.12M per season. Allen, one of the more expensive new type of signings, who is £4.8M p.a. Our average last season ('11/12) was £7.6M. I haven't worked it out yet for the season that just passed but it will be less than that, but still high (Carroll - £11.4M p.a, Downing - £7.64M, Henderson - £7.9M).

That gives you a good idea of just how much we can improve the squad with the new deals - even better if any of the new signings flop, you have a lot of room to maneuver in terms of loaning them out (finding a club to pay £20k a week for a loan is a lot easier than finding a club that can pay £70k a week), transfer fee (selling a young 24 year old who is on £20k a week is a lot easier than a 24 year old who earns £70k a week). We should have no problem finding Assaidi a new home, while most of the players on the old contracts were compensated in some way (Cole, Kuyt, Bellamy, Doni).

To put it into context (and this isn't the first time i've mentioned this) Carroll, Downing and Henderson together are paid more than the total wage bills for the bottom 3 teams in Serie A.",0,1370782523,null,0,1370783165,0,caf7zg4,t3_1fx562,t1_caf7zg4,t1_caev5xg,null,1430873539,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

1. Paying what you've been asked to pay can be split into two categories:

a) Paying the amount requested having taken no active steps to reduce the total

b) Paying the amount requested having taken active steps to reduce the total

I have a problem with both tax law and Vodafone's actions, as I said at the beginning of this. 

&gt;*""For them to pay more than they do its exactly the same as you writing cheques to inland revenue as a gift""*

You're simply wrong to assert that. The amount is not something that exists independent of both parties. Whilst both Vodafone and I are due to pay tax, the respective amounts are related to the action (or, in my case, lack of action) we've each taken to fix it. Whereas sending HMRC  a cheque would be going beyond what is expected of an individual's contribution, Vodafone's **active** steps to ensure evasion and a lower requested tax figure than would otherwise be the case falls short of their expected contribution, and should not be considered acceptable. Indeed it isn't, which is why businesses are repeatedly pulled up on and boycotted over such things. No one in any business who is involved in making these decisions is unaware of the fact that it's not considered an ethical thing for a company to do.

Companies don't accidentally end up paying no tax; it's a decision that they make to cheat the system. In no way is it right to excuse them on the grounds that they're corporate entities: just because it's a business decision doesn't mean that it's one we can, or indeed should, allow. Capitalism need not be synonymous with immorality and, as I mentioned, the Companies Act expressly concerns itself with making clear the fact that one's obligations to their shareholders is not purely based on short-term revenue from dodging tax.

As I've said, most people pay more than they have to in the sense that it isn't challenging to operate at higher expenses or abstractly move operations to a different continent. For Vodafone to pay the amount that would be required of them had they not cheated is *not* the same as an ordinary citizen who doesn't evade tax randomly sending an extra few grand.",0,1370783478,null,0,false,0,caf84pw,t3_1fx4wx,t1_caf84pw,t1_caf4e3y,null,1430873470,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Although I do think he's been lumped in the same boat as PvA, Katuka and Bruma by the staff, possibly undeservingly.

As for PvA and Kakuta I think that the Chelsea coaches have more or less lost all faith in them to perform at a high enough level to benefit the squad. Probably the same with Bruma. They're as old as Hazard etc, older than Varane (and Okore who we tried to sign in January apparently) etc. This is not to say they won't become decent players like Matic has but it's not that likely they'll be like matic. Also we sold Matic at 21, which seems like a plausible scheme at Chelsea. If they're not good enough past 18, loan them to a suitable club. See if they develop, by 21 do another true assessment and see if it's worth holding onto them any longer?

Equally, the main flaw in this is the level of coaching and competition at the clubs they're loaned to (eg Vitesse etc) so it's not necessarily maximising their development.

true,mush01,eng-yorkshire,Northerner in London,"Indeed, but that would justifiably be held under existing laws against slander, whereas I think that some of the laws that are used for these cases on the internet are far too sweeping.

s.127 of the Communications Act 2003, for example, is one of the most hideously subjective pieces of legislation ever.  I quote:

&gt;(1)A person is guilty of an offence if he—
&gt;
&gt;(a)sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character; or
&gt;
&gt;(b)causes any such message or matter to be so sent.

The offence is committed, therefore, not by the intent of the sender, but by the ""character"" of the message, which, along with such subjective language as ""malicious"", ""obscene"", ""indecent"" and ""grossly offensive"", must be decided by the courts.

A good example of how worrying this *could* be is the case of Azhar Ahmed, who was prosecuted and now has a criminal conviction for saying, on his own Facebook page, that our soldiers should go to hell - not a nice thing to say, certainly, but not dangerous, not a threat - and yet he has a criminal record for what is essentially a dissenting opinion.

It's that sort of thing in addition to the increased surveillance that makes me nervous.  Saying nothing of the habit of catch-all laws to get abused (see also the now infamous s.44 of the Terrorism Act 2000), when expressing derogatory views of our troops is already a criminal offence, you have to wonder how safe it is to express other dissenting opinions too, or how dangerous it could be in the future.",0,1370785515,null,0,false,0,caf8hbn,t3_1fz455,t1_caf8hbn,t1_caf7srw,null,1430873408,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

&gt;
&gt;EDIT : Are you talking about Free Market vs Capitalism? Free Market is even more fucked, the powerful get more powerful, and eventually one company will own everything...

Trade is trade, and trade can occur under any number of economic systems and arrangements.  Capitalism has been defined many ways, but most often these days refers to the private ownership of the means of production and a system of private property and contract enforced by a State.  I'm using it in the rather more negative sense that was intended by its early critics who arguably coined or at least popularised the term.

We can undoubtedly debate the meaning of capitalism until we're blue in the face, but suffice it to say that I most certainly do not mean the free market when I talk of capitalism, quite the contrary.  I take the view that free markets and capitalism are antithetical, and I dispute that in genuinely freed (socialist) markets ""the powerful get more powerful, and eventually one company will own everything"".

If you've looked at university league tables, you can consider anything from about 45th down to be a good community college. Googling university league tables uk should get you some good results. Don't base decisions on just one list though. Use two or three.

As people have said, you don't just base uni choice off of reputation in the UK. You should do the following.
_____________
If you know you want to work in your field after uni.

- [choose a uni which is great for your course](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Computer+Science)

If you know you want to do something that isn't related to your course.

- [choose a uni which has a good overall reputation](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?)


However, assuming you're going back to the US after graduation, I would probably have aimed for one that has the best overall reputation in the states. Ie, if you're applying for a job and they see 'university of westminster', they won't have a clue where it is. If they see 'university of Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, Bristol etc, they're much more likely to be impressed.
______________

For example, I study Civil Engineering at Loughborough and know I want to go into Civil Eng after uni. Loughborough is only about 14th overall. However, for Civil Eng specifically it generally ranks highest or very highly for undergraduate teaching and graduate employment. There were other factors that led to that decision like having the highest student satisfaction for about 5 years before I started here and being a really nice campus etc. That came from extra research I did etc.

&gt;I really want to get away from home for a while, and this seems really interesting. Any advice?

Honestly, I'd maybe consider just an out of state uni rather than coming all the way to Europe. My uni is a 3 hour drive from home and in 3 years I've managed to never visit home. The UK will be a big culture shock, especially if you've never been to Europe... we are very lefty compared to Texas.

 I understand why some people feel strongly about it one way or the other.. I think that it's okay to have those different opinions, though. It isn't wrong to feel that a woman would ruin your image of the doctor, we strongly identify each other based on gender and so it is something that would be really hard to not see such a doctor as being a different person, as having an inconsistent identity. Nor is it wrong to have the other view. Times have changed, we know that regeneration can cross the gender divide, and there is a reasonable argument from feminism for having stronger female roles portrayed in TV. Such a thing would undoubtedly further the goal of challenging modern gender dynamics. But I digress. My point is that the middle ground (wanting to see a talented doctor, regardless of gender) is fine and probably fairly common.. but no one is a bad person for having a strong opinion.

 The real extremists are the people who are villianizing one another.. feminists who mistake a strong sense of gender identity as sexism and people who mistake the desire for strong female roles as some kind of radical man-hating element of feminism.

I don't think they'll take anything, I think they'll simply have the events take place inside of the timestream itself.

They probably wouldn't look at your stuff unless you were a terrorist suspect, an organised crime suspect, an Iranian agent, or happened to be in communication with someone else who was any of those things. But again, this is not new. It's just easier.

Also, according to the Washington Post, every query submitted to the system has to be double-checked by at least one FBI agent (to make sure it's not directed at Americans), so that operates as a check, however weak, against rogue agents spying on people for personal gain or for voyeuristic reasons or whatever.

William Hague claims that although the secret services get data from PRISM they are not using PRISM or anything else to get around British law. But even if they were, I don't think they'd be using it against you.

There is another possible use however. If they're using it for state-sponsored corporate espionage against British companies they'd never admit to that.

Indeed, it is often found in combination with the word ‘military’, and this is how many respondents understood the first example below. In any case, it implies limitation of the sovereignty of the country or territory in question^(92), which may not be well received by the public.

The chances of British agents being able to sneak into a Google server farm and hack into the right server without being detected are virtually nil, so this is the way to go for that kind of thing, if it's available via PRISM. Although it may be more of a case of passive information passing from America to Britain - I don't know if our agents get to ask questions, or whether they just take what data they're given.

If the data you want ISN'T located on American servers, PRISM can't help you anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I wasn't saying to use stereotypes to cater to demographics. I only mentioned stereotypes because I don't know a lot about exact ages. I was useing them to describe the age I was referring to because I don't know the exact number. It was besides the point. 

I already went into cross appeal in the last comment and already mentioned that they're numerous exceptions. I'll tell you that, no matter how many exceptions, you still want a stable demographic. I used Star Trek and WWE as an example. Neither of them use stereotypes to cater, do they? WWE just made themselves family friendly with good role models instead of what they were known for before the change(shock tv). Star Trek abandons the social commentary formula to make a more traditional action/adventure movie with broad appeal. See, targeting demographics without stereotypes. Now, you could argue WWE kind of used stereotypes to cater to it's demographic but I mean really, most parents don't want there kids watching what it used to be. You'd rather have your young child watch family friendly role models than rude, crude, anti heroes in a show with more blood than a Friday the 13th movie. There's exceptions but ask most parents, they'd probably prefer the PG one.  

And I wasn't talking about whether or not The Doctor should be a women. I was saying it's not going to happen because whether we like it or not, companies want money. They're always gonna stick to what's safe. There job is to make money, not to push the envelope. Of course, there's exceptions, but Who has always come off as staying safe to me as they always take the tone to resemble what's popular at the time. 4: star trek tos type sci-fi, 6: dark 80's sci-fi, 11: Harry Potter type fantasy movies. Not making any waves and challenging anything, just going with the status quo to stay relevant. That's the safest way to stay popular and keep the series alive. If you look at my examples, WWE and Star Trek, who were both also around quite a long time and they were most popular when cashing on something, similar to Who. WWF cashed in on cartoon heroes in the 80's with hogan and shock tv in the late 90's. They did the worst business when not caring about being relevant. New Generation era, Ruthless Agression. Both failed to adjust and failed with viewers. If you look at Star Trek, TNG updated the formula for the time it aired. Look at any other spin-off, or the TNG movies, they failed, usually from changing too much. If you had personal financial stake in Doctor Who, you would call for the safest bet, not a complete and total risk. Maybe not you personally, but most would. Especially though who worked there way into top positions. 

Also, I have to ask, what's wrong with a male Doctor? If men and women are equal then surely there's nothing wrong with him staying male? Why not create or bring back a character(Romana) who could be his exact equal, if not surpass him, instead?

If you changed a 50 year old character in any drastic way, a lot of the casual audience are going to be alienated, regardless of politics. 6 failed because his personality was too different. They *risk* lose the large popularity and a hefty chunk of money(merchandising). Why would you risk your golden goose? It's the same reason WWE won't catered to people who want shock tv back and Abrams won't cater to Trekkies. 

I personally think it would be better to leave the main character the same(you need at least *one* constant in a show that's so centered around change to not piss casual viewers off) and bring back someone like Romana. A timelady who can be just as smart as the Doctor if not better in a lot of ways. Wouldn't that be a more feminist idea? It would also provide a lot *better* storytelling then randomly regenerating into a woman. That said, I really don't think Moffatt can do justice to a character like that. Don't get me wrong, I love his run so far like any other era of Who, he just has a problem with female characters. Amy overstayed her welcome, River doesn't really have depth. I do like that Clara is smart and clever and she's probably my favorite companion of new Who for being that way, but the sexual tension was un-needed. 

My favorite thing about Romana II from what I've seen of her, is you get the impression she knows more than The Doctor, and it provided a very interesting dynamic, and good female role model, without alienating anyone. That's what I liked about Amy in The Beast Below and even her first episode she was more brave and intelligent than a little girl normally would be portrayed as. That disappeared *quickly* though and she became a damsel in distress a lot. 

It would solve 4 problems if they could pull it off: Better written companions, strong female role model, no risk of alienation, one constant for the story to latch on to. On the other hand, if Moffat can't write females like suspected, and the main character is a female, then there goes the whole show. I suppose you could say the same for my proposed companion idea but it's much less of a risk as she's not the whole show. If done right though, she would be just as important as the Doctor is to the show until it's time for a new character. Perhaps under the next show runner.

The Doctor goes over most of your questions quickly in the Shakespeare code. 

It's also good to know that time is in constant flux. But the thing is, all you remember you only do because of your current timeline. Which means, that if anything in the past is changed, you won't actually know because you'll have never known the original information to begin with due to the timeline being altered. In other words, your present warps around all the events taking place in the past, but you never notice it. So I guess in a way, the present is continuously changing, but then at the same time, it isn't from your point of view.

*In a graphic last novel the cancer-stricken author details the ravages wrought by the disease, writes Richard Brooks*

HE ANNOUNCED that he was dying from cancer on his website and has since posted a series of blogs about his health, life and emotions.

Now, Iain Banks, the bestselling author, is to detail  in the pages of his final novel  the emotional and physical ravages of the disease.

The Quarry, which will be published on June 20, describes the final weeks in the life of Guy, a man in his forties who is terminally ill with cancer.

Cared for by Kit, his 18-year-old son, Guy summons some of his old university friends to his house in the Pennines to tell them what he thinks of the world that he is preparing to leave.

Banks, 59, is known for a series of popular books including The Wasp Factory and The Crow Road, which was made into a TV series. He began writing his final novel after he was diagnosed with gall bladder cancer in March.

A month later, he went public with the news and said he was unlikely to live for more than a year.

While The Quarry is fiction, it is also partly autobiographical.

The descriptions of Guy's cancer and the ravaging effects on his body are both detailed and graphic.

In one passage, Kit says: ""I know Guy's cancer is not contagious.

You can't catch it off him. That's the thing about cancer. It's all yours  it's entirely, perfectly personalised.

""The cause might have come from outside, like carcinogens in tobacco smoke, but that just triggered the reaction in your cells. In that sense the fatal cancer is an unwilled suicide where, initially at least, one small part of the body has taken a decision which will lead to the death of the rest. Cancer feels like betrayal.""

Guy is implacably opposed to alternative treatments. When Priscilla, one of his friends, suggests he consider them, he rants: ""You can keep that bollocks.""

In a recent blog, Banks thanked his fans for ""offering medical advice  especially those with links to tests and trials, and published papers""  a signal that he is pursuing conventional treatment. The privations of cancer are detailed by Kit and Guy, who at times is forced to use a Zimmer frame to get around. ""Cancer even spoils the taking of drugs,"" Guy reflects. He rages against the current state of Britain, excoriating the Daily Mail, supermarkets, climatechange deniers and ""this island's pathetic, grovelling population of celebrity-obsessed, superficially fixated w******"".

Banks announced he was dying from cancer in early April. ""It started in my gall bladder, has infected both lobes of my liver and probably also my pancreas and some lymph nodes, plus one tumour is massed around a group of major blood vessels in the same volume, effectively ruling out any chance of surgery to remove the tumours either in the short or long term.

""The bottom line, now, I''m afraid, is that as a late-stage gall bladder cancer patient, I'm expected to live for 'several months' and it''s extremely unlikely I'll live beyond a year,"" he wrote. The author added that he had asked ""my partner Adele [Hartley] if she will do me the honour of becoming my widow"". She accepted.

After returning from their honeymoon to Venice and Paris, Banks took the opportunity to thank his fans for their support.

""I feel treasured, I feel loved, I feel I've done more than just pursue the craft I adore and make a living from it, and more than just fulfil the only real ambition I've ever had  of becoming a professional writer,"" he told them.

In recent blogs Banks has written of how ""it's only the fact that I've been able to preannounce my own demise that has allowed me to realise my portion of that love in full while I'm still around to appreciate it"".

In late May, he wrote of ""a mostly sunny holiday on the isle of Barra. As always when we go there, we both relaxed  walking on pristine beaches, listening to the quietness, eating just-caught sea food, and chatting to friendly islanders."" Banks, whose science fiction books have gone under the name of the Culture series, used the same blog post to attack critics who have ""assumed that my sci-fi was the trashy but high-selling stuff I had to churn out to keep a roof over my head"".

He wrote: ""It was never the case. The SF novels have always mattered deeply to me - the Culture series in particular. Rant over.""",0,1370799929,null,0,false,0,cafcajt,t3_1fzf43,t1_cafcajt,t1_cafc1gj,null,1435559553,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Anyways, Meta-Ten is as much The Doctor as ""real,"" Ten. He still has the same memories, emotions, experiences, etc. He's just part human-part timelord. Also consider what most people theorize the Hurt Doctor is- the Doctor that ended the Time War, condemning the Time Lords AND the Daleks. This is a Doctor with a moral compass that's out of whack, presumable due to his being born in the heat of a vicious war.

Yes, we know that Eleven has certainly had darker moments. He's been shown to be callous and vengeful at times. But he also always sticks to his morals- (i.e. ""Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many."") However, there ARE people out there that have committed genocide, and there ARE people who were born in the heat of battle. There is someone who not only shares the memories of the experiences of the presumable 8.5, but also came into the world in nearly the exact same manner- in a war against the Daleks. 

Who are these people? Meta-Ten and Rose. They both committed genocide against the Daleks, and like Hurt, Meta-Ten was born in the heat of battle against the Daleks. So whatever Hurt is planning, Meta-Ten would CERTAINLY be a valuable partner. Even more valuable than ""regular"" Ten, in my opinion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The idea of feminists arguing that we should take away the only male role model that appears to use his brain rather than weapons or fists seems rather alien to me. 

Perhaps, then, as feminists we should encourage more of these characters to be created so that, instead of having a ""gender squabble"" over who gets the kickass, clever, sympathetic, brave, funny, generous, relatively non-violent, genius protagonist, we can have enough of these great role models for any kid to find one they like?

Above all, feminism should be about the idea that men are equal to women and women are equal to men - the same as racial equality argues that people are equal regardless of skin colour and sexual equality argues that people are equal regardless of sexuality. Surely this means that the feminist argument would be that the BBC should audition men and women, and consider both equally, and then when they find an actor or actress who fits the role, they know what gender the next Doctor will be?

If I, as a female, have to put up with having Amy Pond, Clara Oswin and River Song as my role models (lovely characters, but I don't plan on encouraging my future daughters to be like any of them), then surely boys could put up with having male companions as their role models? 

Why is a show with a male protagonist gender-neutral, but a show with a female protagonist is considered to not be appealing to the younger male audiences? That says more about how we are teaching young boys to think of characters than the show itself - my little brother loved Dora the Explorer, but as soon as he went to school he had other boys saying he couldn't have a Dora lunchbox and that it should be a Diego lunchbox because he's a boy. Why is it okay to bend to parents who want their sons to have male role models when it's not okay to bend to females wanting to be represented?

Above all, the Doctor is the personality, not the body he (or she) is in. This should not be the big deal that so many people are making it out to be. The BBC should audition males, females, black people, Asian people, white people, gay people, straight people, and maybe a few cross dressers for good luck (as well as the copious other groups that I missed out there for brevity, apologies), and then pick whoever acts the best.

You'll need to find other people to live with on your own - try things like online forums and stuff.

What's missed, I think, is that CCTV isn't even about security - it's about cost. How many cameras can you mount on poles for the cost of a couple of bobbies on the beat? Lots. Never mind that they do very little to *prevent* crime, they've not even been very effective at  helping *resolve* crime after the fact either. But, they're cheap and they give the impression of security so it's a big tick-mark in someone's checklist.

As, if I can switch tack, is all this PRISM / Metadata collection stuff. Oh, I'm sure the algorithms and pipes are up to tracking what you're up to, Mr J.

My memory is probably very biased towards the end of the campaign but, I felt Johnson attacking was not the best, often wasting simple opportunities by over-dribbling and often failing to find his man with short passes (the crosses can be forgiven as players rarely made the best runs). Downing's defensive contribution aided Johnson immensely, probably helping his high tackle success percentage.

Yeah, I reckon that was mainly the second half of the season. Thinking back I seem to remember considering Johnson one of our best players for the first half, where the team really struggled at times. He was definitely the best left back in Premier League for a few games, him and Sterling were quite effective together.

The Doctor is not the constant in the show- he changes every few years. The one constant is the TARDIS.

Boys are typically more pushed into the ""boy box"" than girls into the ""girls box"".

Not to mention that if a boy cries for example they'll be like ""boys don't cry"". At every turn, them being boys is engraved into their identity, not to mention the fact that boys and girls are different is engraved in there as well. Now imagine a girl crying, do you think the parents will tell her ""she's only crying because she's a girl"" or they'll treat her as an actual human being and be supportive?

Having a cool, fun male role model like the Doctor is good for boys. The BBC don't make anything like this. There's nothing else on the BBC for boys. They don't make very much for males of any description. Most nights I wonder where my licence fee is going. Soaps, crime and period dramas, that's all they make.

I can answer your tv question, at least with American televison.  society changed, tv caught up, at least in America. We had the hippies movement which was a liberal as you could get sexually in 60's and loosened it up society and it continued to go along that track with a few setbacks. Then it was okay for gay people to be on tv and show, it was okay to be more sexual.

You are wrong - the Emirates has a fantastic design with fantastic views wherever you are seated.  The stadium and atmosphere plays a large part in the psychology of football and it intimidates away players.

There is space to re-design the stadium at Stamford Bridge - it would mean knocking a lot of the stadium down, the East Stand in particular - but it can be done.  That it will cost a lot of money is not in denial.

Again - moving forward - what on earth does this term mean with regards to a football club?  It is just crass business speak that holds no relevance in this conversation.

The Emirates has a terrible acoustic design, the sound simply doesn't travel well at all. Yes, the views are good, but the atmosphere is constantly poor. It's fun to dig at Arsenal fans for that, but in reality you have to look further than that. Build a stadium with the fans right on top of the pitch and the atmosphere will be great, also make the acoustics rebound inside the stadium and not up and out easily.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Why can't they? The Doctor is slightly flawed, having commited genocide and having some darker moments in New Who. I can name plenty of shows and movies where a different character is on the same level if not more as the main character. For example. Lord of the rings, They are side characters far more powerful and noble than Frodo Bagggins and above his level despite Frodo being the main character.  They may not be *more* important than Frodo with a couple exceptions in the books, but they're definitely better when judging by most traits. Only thing Frodo has going for him is innocence and friendship. There's people more skilled with geography, fighting, knowledge, etc. Gandalf is arguably more important than Frodo. Main character doesn't mean your top dog, just the story is about you. Yes, the Doctor is very important but that doesn't mean he can't be one upped. 

And no, that's not how writing works. They asked themselves what would make a good story and answered it with ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"".  You come up with a good concept. Brainstorm, list a few ideas, then choose the best one and write a plot around it. I'm sure they were more concerned with the reasons why it would make a good episode than why it wouldn't.

Any casting decision changes the plot. You don't think Smith's Doctor was written around his awkwardness he could portray? You don't think Tom Baker's Doctor was written around his goofiness he could portray? Hell, casting alone changed the dynamic of companions. In Hartnell, he had companions do most of the work for them(and often surpassed The Doctor's skill which you said can't be done) because he couldn't do it. Casting, no matter what, can and will change the plot and dynamic. It's the first female Doctor, you're very naive if you think they won't draw special attention to that fact in-show for a while to pat themselves on the back. Television still has a bit of a way to mature, it's really getting there though with some shows, but I would never list Doctor Who as the pinnacle of mature television. There's nothing wrong with that, light hearted escapism as it's place and it's no worse or better than a drama, but genre and level or writing does limit how things would be handled.

I think it's a risk but I'm willing to take risks.

For one thing, I think Tennant and Smith created their Doctor personas largely by mixing and matching features of their favorite past Doctors. I'd like to get away from that and I think casting a woman might help. Bring new material to the character. And if someone later wants to mix and match, they'd have more on their palette.

Another point is dissatisfaction with how women have largely been written on the show. Casting a woman as the Doctor would hopefully force the writers to write a woman as a real person, a three-dimensional character.

And I just think variety is the spice of life. I've been feeling that some kind of change is needed, some real new blood injected in, and coincidentally the question of a new Doctor presents itself. Of course there are risks, and of course some fans would just be dicks about it, and of course it's not the only option we have to bring changes, but I think it's one of the most potent changes that could be made and I'd like a potent change.",0,1370814147,null,0,false,0,cafgxxv,t3_1fz1fr,t1_cafgxxv,t1_caf7ssk,null,1430869159,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I was only challenging your view so you could challenge mine in something more substantial than ""I believe this"". No disrespect was meant. I was never blatantly saying your opinion was false, I was suggesting that you reasoning is open for debate and has at least 2 sides to it.

That may of been worded oddly but I'm not saying your opinion is false. I'm saying everyone has a different opinion and I respect that but at the end of the day, they're just opinions and are no where near fact, even my own, which is why I want you and others challenge mine by supporting your opinions with examples that aren't up for debate. 

That list seems to be mostly opinion with a couple facts that I've taken into consideration already so it doesn't challenge my opinion than I already have myself.

So you have no way to know your opinion is right just like the opposing side does. And you can use facts to support or disprove opinions about it though. You did it yourself in that post.

For example, the Doctor has only been played by white males because it started in 63. That's a fact, you used it to support your opinion. So you obviously *can* use facts to form an opinion like this as you've done it. Honestly, a very compelling argument. More so than anything you've mentioned in our debate, which was just opinion.

In any debate, stating your opinion over and over is less likely to convince anyone, especially stubborn people, because they don't agree. I'm sure you may have a hard time accepting the counter point to this argument if not backed up with facts.  The same goes for the people you're trying to convince. 

You are more likely to convince people of your argument using facts like that whole only white male started in 63 thing and finding more to support or to support your other opinions on the matter or to disprove other's opinions. 

You can argue about opinions for weeks and two stubborn people will learn anything and just waste time. If you present facts to back it up, like you did with giving the reason the doctor's been a white male, it's much harder to argue with. Well, unless there was a british tv show with a female lead back then but as far as I'm aware, not even American tv was that liberal until the 70's so it stands as fact.

&gt;When we're talking about issues of diversity, media representation and the effect gender/race/sexuality has on the show and how it will be perceived, that's not really something you can back up with a lot of facts.

You're slightly misunderstanding me here. I'm agreeing with you that no one can predict the future and know exactly how it will effect the show. It's for that reason why you and I stating unfounded opinions are worthless too stubborn people who disagree. No offense meant at all and I hope none taken. Your opinion is worth something, I'm just saying stubborn people will think it's worthless as they would anyone's opinion they disagree with. It's more of a negative reflection upon  them than us and our opinions and you see it all the time. 

I'm saying you can look at how other shows and film has handled diversity and flipping conventional gender/race/sexuality/age dynamics in the past and how it was received to have healthy speculation on how it would effect Doctor Who.  You can use much more than that too. Those are facts that would support one side or another and can't be argued about. People still infer there own opinions which is the wonderful thing about them but listing those type of things I've mentioned make for a wonderful, compelling argument.

If I may use Evil Dead as an example to argue for your side for a brief moment, I'd like to to show you what I mean. It's no secret the american horror genre had the cliche female survivor for a long time once slashers became popular. The original Evil Dead turned on it's head by having a weak male survive so it would be a bit of a surprise, people loved this unconventional twist with gender and it has a huge cult following til this day. The new film does a similar thing but twists it around. You except the male to survive because it's Evil Dead, but a strong female takes the role of the heroic ash. People *loved* this twist too. This is an undebatable fact that shows how recasting a role that's associated with a certain gender can be well received. Other facts can show it's not always the case, but setting the precedent it's unarguably happened before certainly makes it harder to poke holes in the opinion.

My point was that both of them did gender swapping for the main roles and were received well despite your personal opinions, which are not fact. My point was ""If Evil Dead fans can accept a female Ash, then possibly Doctor Who fans could accept a female Doctor.""  which supports your opinion and is hard to argue with since it's a fact. Regardless of whether you or I like it, it's a good fact to use to support that opinion.

There's  no or less sexim in DW so it should be easier to accept for DW fans.

The rent is twice as much as self-catered, and much much more than you would pay to have your own flat.

There's a bit more independence in self-catered. You can have people over, you can have parties, you can cook your own food etc. It's literally like living in your own flat, except everyone in your flat goes to your uni and so does everyone in your building. It's really friendly and a great way to meet people. In my building, we all kept our front doors to our flats open for the first term because people were always popping in to say hi or hang out or whatever. It just feels way more comfortable.

All the films are hated by most and and have many, many, signs of failing as a movie but something about them resonates with a group of people. 

As an aside about sexism in horror, the whole survivor girl aspect was never invented intentionally. Carpenter, who invented the trope in Halloween, just thought Lauri Strode would survive because she's the only responsible, level headed teen among the slacker, irresponsible teenage stereotypes, both male and female. It's shown through how she handles situations from babysitting to surviving a serial killer. She was also able to save the kids because she was more mature and responsible than her peers. You cant tell by Carpenter's work in satire(They Live) in his interviews about it that he's liberal minded. Friday The 13th came out which focused on the exploitative side of the format and sealed the trope, Carpenter left after II so Halloween series started using the trope it's self. 

Not really anything important, just a little history in how that genre got to be that way. If you asked me why I horror movies can get away with lesser quality of writing, I have no answer to that.

&gt;Try I never actually told you what my opinion of the monarchy is? Just the simple reality that it exists, even if you dislike it, so regardless of whether you or I agree with the concept, Prince Harry is still a prince.

Clearly you are a royalist. And clearly don't like the idea of monarchy being questioned. Otherwise you wouldn't be engaging with me.

&gt; because the community here has had that discussion many times over.

I strongly doubt that. I strongly doubt the /r/unitedkingdom sub has ever had a serious, proper debate on the matter.

&gt;Your anti-monarchist views aren't revolutionary or ground-breaking.

Exactly.

&gt;You're not being downvoted because people are supporting the monarchy, you're being downvoted because you're being deliberately obtuse and your comments are delusional. End of. 

Come now. You and I know both know it doesn't work that way on reddit. People vote and downvote based on their own preconceived notions of the world. Support the circle jerk and you get upvoted, go against it and you get downvoted. On /r/unitedkingdom there is a pro-monarchy circlejerk, not an anti-""obtuse and delusional"" comment circlejerk.

&gt;and don't pretend you're trying to enlighten people about the monarchy

I'm not trying to enlighten anyone. I'm trying to pick at their preconceived notions of the world to break them down and force to rexamine how they came to those notions. Which I would like you to do.

As I said before every country is unequal. The ONLY positions you cannot reach in the UK is the monarchy, which has no direct power over any government decisions, it's simply a cultural left over which works fine and people enjoy so it sticks around.

There is nothing stopping you from becoming PM if you have a strong Yorkshire accent apart from the voters, which is exactly what happens EVERYWHERE else too.

The UK's unequal society is not due to the monarchy, and pretending otherwise is burying your head in the sand. Addressing the issue is important and using the monarchy as a scape goat won't help. If we abolish the monarchy right now there will still be inequality, and that won't change over time. 

I would love to see society become more equal but there are far more important steps to take, education is out of whack. Everyone needs access to the best education not just the wealthy, university needs to become free again, the wealth divide needs a serious shrinking and we need a hell of a lot of tax reforms.

As far as income equality goes, in general the UK is not great, I think we are the worst in Europe. Overall however we are well behind many other developed countries, very few of whom use a monarchy.

1) I don't have a clue what her shoe size is. I have her fiance looking into this, but I don't know what to do I know there's a little bit of variance in brands with different women's shoes. I am absolutely paranoid of showing up and they are the wrong size. Any advice about this? I want to try and keep this as much of surprise as possible. 

At this point, I'm considering spending a little extra on the shoes to make sure she can go try them on at another location of the same store before I get them. 

2) Could I do it with a shoe like [this](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/shoes/shop-womens-shoes/worthington-maggie-patent-pumps/prod.jump?ppId=pp5002490735&amp;catId=cat100240063&amp;deptId=dept20000018&amp;N=100330019%20%201402&amp;extDim=true&amp;topDim=Categories&amp;topDimvalue=pumps+%26+heels&amp;dimCombo=Categories%7CColor%7C&amp;dimComboVal=pumps+%26+heels%7Cblues%7C&amp;currentDim=Color&amp;currentDimVal=blues)? You talked a lot about rounded heels, but would pointed work ok, too?

3) Also, would an open toe shoe be out of the picture? Something like [This](http://i.imgur.com/DzApdgS.jpg)

4) Finally, if I do go with idea for her to go try the shoes on under a ruse, I'm thinking of possibly these two pairs ([1](http://i.imgur.com/lX8KSdn.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/7BJSzsn.jpg)). Thoughts on these two pairs?

Yes but it is EXTREMELY unlikely given the oligarchy in Britain.

It has nothing to do with the voters, they are simply given the choice between persons who are selected by that oligarchy.

Personally, I believe this to be anti-evolution of humanity, but reality on the whole doesn't support the fact that the powers that be agree with me. It takes individuals like the NSA whistleblower to evolve human consciousness and update our 'knowledge' of what is *actually* right and wrong.

And no, I'm not a manic conspiracy theorist, evidence and human psychology shapes my thinking and opinions. I'm also a long time Private eye reader ;)

&gt; Finally when you complain about the evils of Western Civilisation remember that you yourself enjoy the benefits of the Western World them in the forms of the welfare state and representative democracy

""Benefit"" is another word that depends on the perception of the user. The western world is as rich as it is because of the foreign labour it abused, murdered and stole from via greed, thirst for power and empire building. An assumption on my part is our backgrounds and perception on the world are different from the point of view of available money and the opportunities money gives. I was brought up, not in a poor household, but we weren't well off at all. I also had a foot in both camps because I got a scholarship after sitting the old 11+ exam to the 'posh' school because I was good at remembering the crap they throw at you in the education system, then regurgitating it. Simply going to that school gave me networking and other opportunities that I wouldn't have had if I'd gone to the comprehensive down the road.

'Perception' continued - the area I grew up in was pretty rough - and going to the school I did, created it's own problems from the kids who lived around me. And they were right to a degree, it was unfair on them - they mightn't have had the memory I did to get a scholarship, but their families definitely didn't have the money to get round it and get a 'better' education than the state provided. I also grew up hearing the stories of family being cleared from the land in Scotland - and on the Irish side, the disgusting treatment by the English which the queen even apologised for a few years ago. I even have far removed - and coloured, cousins (in name at least) in the Caribbean with the family name of those Irish that were rounded up and sold as slaves. There's a lot more, but suffice to say, when you say I've benefited - which I have to some degree, I also see it from from the point of view that the 'benefits' came from the broken backs of the exploited and the greed of the aristocracy and merchant class at the time. Empathy, compassion and fairness are not things things the rich are known for - in fact, psychology places many of them - when their actions are examined - on the sociopathic scale. As an example, a trip round Britain, looking at who owns the land now, makes for some sorry history as to how their ancestors first acquired it - and those alive now that benefit from it are more than happy with the status quo. If you've met or worked for/with any of them - which I have, you'd know there's some real fucked up individuals in that class of people; people, any rational cynic would agree, should have zero power over others.

&gt; Yes the inequalities and corruption that go with should be fought it is also a fact that if I support these institutions these things will exist and the best I can hope to do is minimise them.

The whole thing smacks of viewing things unobjectively, through rose tinted glasses. While i grant you that we're no longer manufacturing as much as we once were, a lot of the stuff we were making, wasn't exactly top notch...and for that reason, the companies went under, deservedly so. The big manufacturing we do now, are things like the Rolls Royce Trent Aero engines - there's a reason they never went under....they didn't make a steaming pile of shit!

To counter the slanted nostalgia, here's a selection of Lucas related jokes, to remind you that not all british industry is worthy of praise:

* Why didn't the Germans bomb the Lucas plants during WWII? The Germans considered Lucas an ally.

* The Lucas motto: ""Get home before dark.""

* ""And the Lord said 'let there be light'. Joseph Lucas replied 'no way, Lord, no way'.""

* Lucas denies having invented darkness. But they still claim ""sudden, unexpected darkness"".

* Lucas - inventor of the first intermittent wiper.

* Lucas - inventor of the self-dimming headlamp.

* The three-position Lucas switch: DIM, FLICKER and OFF. The other three switch settings: SMOKE, SMOULDER and IGNITE.

* The original anti-theft devices - Lucas Electric products.

* ""I've had a Lucas pacemaker for years and have never experienced any prob...""

* If Lucas made guns, wars would not start either.

* Did you hear about the Lucas powered torpedo? It sank.

* It's not true that Lucas, in 1947, tried to get Parliament to repeal Ohm's Law. They withdrew their efforts when they met too much resistance.

* Did you hear the one about the guy that peeked into a Land Rover and asked the owner ""How can you tell one switch from another at night, since they all look the same?"" ""He replied, it doesn't matter which one you use, nothing happens!""

* Back in the '70s Lucas decided to diversify its product line and began manufacturing vacuum cleaners. It was the only product they offered which didn't suck.

* Quality Assurance phoned and advised the Engineering guy that they had trouble with his design shorting out. So he made the wires longer.

* Why do the English drink warm beer? Lucas made the refrigerators, too.

* Alexander Graham Bell invented the Telephone. Thomas Edison invented the Light Bulb. Joseph Lucas invented the Short Circuit.

* Recommended procedure before taking on a repair of Lucas equipment: check the position of the stars, sacrifice a chicken and walk three times clockwise around your car chanting: ""Oh mighty Prince of Darkness protect your unworthy servant.""

* Lucas systems actually uses AC current - it just has a random frequency.

* Lucas is an acronym for Loose Unsoldered Connections and Splices.

* In the 1980's Lucas tried to get into the newly burgeoning PC market, but they discontinued the product when they couldn make it leak oil.

* Why are there no skyscrapers in London? Lucas makes lifts.

* Lucas Factory motto? ""Put in a good day's work then home before dark.""

true,Dyltreeno,null,null,"I have to disagree.  Mourinho bought and made Makelele a legend.  He bought Mikel to succeed him, and Mikel started off well.  Had a rough time when Makelele left and when Mou left.  The guy was very young when he was signed, and signed under pretty difficult conditions.  Between seasons 2010/11 and last season I'd say he was one of our most important players.  


Mikel's passing is superb.  I rarely remember a time when he messed up a possible pass.  He always chooses the smartest pass.  His positioning is fantastic.  His tactical reading of the game is always pretty spot on.  If he gets totally beaten it's when the opponent has a an upper hand on  him. Never gets the ball stolen from him.  His first touch is almost always perfect.  His feet are fast, and getting faster.  Heading is getting better.  Confidence is getting better.  He doesn't get involved in the bullshit.  Just shows up to play football, and does that, especially in big games.  We're a big game club, he's a big game player. Has pretty much every trophy he's been able to get, so can kind of just enjoy the game, and try to improve; any videogame fans he's prestige upped in a sense.  


Speaking as a goalie, he's a good solid reliable player.  His position is pretty much vital and he's damn good at getting himself out of tricky situations.  Could be a bit faster, but no doubt he'll make up for that in improving his positioning with more experience.  I've always had some reliable DM's in front of me (*that's what she said*). 
They really do make a huge difference.


[This is him in year 2010/11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T-7T2rza3k).  Id say he is even more consistant and of an improved level.  He's young and that's only 2 seasons. It'd be insane not to continue to develop him, especially with his length of  time at Chelsea, and now Mou back.  Just needs to get the goal out of his way.  So we can all rejoice.

We'd be left with Gerrard, Henderson, Sturridge, Coutinho and Enrique from the usual first 11. And there's doubt surrounding Henderson and Jose's futures too.

On one hand I want our team to be made up of the manager's players. Players that fit into his system. But changing too much, too fast, is a recipe for disaster. We need to be keeping some senior players. 

The writer seems to think there are bids coming in for Lucas and Johnson? We know Reina and Agger are wanted, but I've never heard of any interest for those two? Are they just putting two and two together now that Rafa has a solid job again?

The best way to meet people and make friends though really is through societies and/or sports clubs though. EUSA's website should have a student society directory, and EUSU has a sports club directory. There are 2 days in the fresher's fayer dedicated to societies and clubs for you to find and if you want join them there and then, or you can join later (some sports clubs and musical societies hold tryouts/auditions the weekend of freshers week. Since you said spring I assume you mean semester 2. This means you will miss out on the freshers week stuff, although there is a mini refreshers fayer for people like you it's not nearly as good, And most societies don't bother to pay for a stall. As such i suggest checking out the websites online and emailing any societies you are interested in.

&gt; The confrontation came on a training exercise in Canada in September 2008 and is detailed in a book Wharton has written about his ten-year military career, Out In The Army – **exclusive extracts from which appear in today’s Mail on Sunday**.

So it's almost certainly a book written by a ghost writer specifically for serialising in the Mail on Sunday.  In which case, I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover that the author(s) had used a fair bit of ""artistic licence"" to make things more interesting.  In fact I would be *very* surprised if they hadn't.

Remember that a book isn't a testimony in a court of law.  Its purpose is to sell newspapers and the authors have no obligation to tell the truth.  Their obligation is to product an interesting story that sells newspapers.

If the incident really did happen then the Daily Mail and other sources would be reporting it first hand.  They're not.  The DM is publishing extracts of his book and the DT is quoting it ""according to the DM"". That's a big red flag.  Not to mention the fact that the incident happened 6 years ago and the solider was inside a tank when it allegedly took places outside the tank (""I poked my head out of  the turret a few moments later to see him having a go... I could see he wasn't holding back).

I'm not talking about just OP, many people on this sub have had this mindset. On another note, FFP is to make sure teams don't go into debt. It doesn't prevent teams from spending assloads of money.

No! I don't want the government to know everything about everyone everywhere because its an oppressive system. It breeds self censorship and breaks democracy.

Aside from that, the boot swings both way. If this stuff wasn't controversial they shouldn't need to hide it, right? National security is invariably the defence used when the government breaks the law. It is invoked to control its position and prevent due process. See the rendition cases.

Terrorism is another chestnut, designed to invoke the strongest tactics the government can use, again limiting due process, removing all those awkward things like fair trials and the needs to charge people (and thus allow them legal aid). Invoking fear in the electorate in order to control decisions and policy.

Governments should be afraid of their people and a well informed electorate is the cornerstone to a free society. ""National security"" , ""terrorist activity"" and ""public interest"" are the weapons of the state against its people - appealing to fear of the triplicate of dangers, money, sex and violence.

It was so rushed, so forced, so unconvincing - I physically cringed whenever the script made that poor girl give the Doctor the doe-eyes. She just had a number of things working against her in my book: for one thing I am completely and utterly against there ever being anything romantic between the Doctor and ANY companion, period. I hated it with Rose too, but I sort of tollerated it because it happened slowly and gradually and also they never exactly went out and SAID: hey, these two are romantic now, it was more left in the implications and our own interpretation, when it came to the original Doctor (as opposed to the meta-crisis Doctor). 

However when Martha showed up, it was like: BAM, she's suddenly in love with him. BAM, it was too soon after I'd just barely gotten over it with Rose. BAM, there's a subplot with her in love with him and he actually falling in love with a human. It was as though somebody went through my personal list of things I'd never want to see the Doctor do and went and made them do them all. 

Favourite companion is: Clara. Yes it's early, but she's a delight.

**Do Liverpool Need ‘A’ Suarez?**

- *Liverpool FC are struggling to return to the top of the European game, and Luis Suarez‘s impending departure only adds to Brendan Rodgers’ troubles. Can LFC replace their Uruguayan star?*


Liverpool FC desperately need to get back into the Champions League. Their history and reputation demand that they should be competing season after season with the best of the best in Europe. Towards the end of last season, which was Brendan Rodgers’ first in charge, Liverpool were showing signs that they are a team on the rise. With the right catalyst, they would once again be in a position to face off against the best and regain their place as a team that can fight for the title.

Under Rodgers, Liverpool have played a very fluid, attack-minded form of football. The style requires that every player on the pitch should be capable of helping the play along, contribute to the passing and, whenever possible, help in the creation and scoring of goals. Unfortunately, the squad Rodgers inherited had not been assembled with that intent. Players like Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing and Steven Gerrard are a little more accustomed to more direct traditional English football — the kind with a Peter Crouch or Andy Carroll lurking up front. Then suddenly the boss no longer wants you to just put good balls into the enemy’s 18-yard box, but also to pass the ball along in tidy little triangles. Also constantly be able to make intelligent forward runs. Also add on to the goal tally as often as possible. While most of the players have tried to adapt as best they could to the new system, there have been deficiencies that have come to light.

What Suarez brings to Liverpool

Thankfully, Liverpool have had Luis Suarez around to pick up some of the slack. Calling him a nightmare for defenders may be a cliche, but it is also the absolute truth. He has been a constant threat to the opposition with his dribbling and his ability to score goals.

To somewhat oversimplify , Luis Suarez is a swiss army knife with the following attachments:

1. A Goal Scorer: With 23 goals in the season, Suarez was the second-highest goal scorer of the Premier League in the 2012-13 season. He may not be the most elegant of finishers or a physically dominating force in the penalty box, but he does have a knack for regularly rolling the ball into the back of the net.
2. A dribbler who can go past defenders: Stats may not give the complete picture, but they can sometimes give a good indication of a reality. For instance, this past season Suarez completed the most dribbles (291), vastly higher than runner-ups Taarabt (159), Ben Arfa (155) and Gareth ‘best thing since sliced bread’ Bale (154).
3. Someone who can hold onto the ball in the final third: An often undervalued skill, Suarez’s ability to hold onto the ball has been essential element of Liverpool’s attack. He provides players like Sturridge and Gerrard those crucial few extra moments to join in on the attack when needed.

If Liverpool were to lose Suarez this summer, even a 20 goals a season striker may not suffice; they would need to replacements for each three of aspects.

Like-for-like replacement vs. strengthening multiple positions

A ‘star’ player can help make up for lack of talent in other positions, and can make players around him look better. To be a good team, you either need a squad that is strong in all positions, or a decent squad with one or more star players in the mix. With Suarez in the team, players like Coutinho, Sturridge and Henderson have been looking like players that belong in a Champions League team (to put it one way). However, this may not be the case if he leaves. Without Suarez constantly pulling defenders out of position and making threatening runs, these other players may not come out looking as good.

In the contingency of Suarez’s departure, Liverpool will have two options: 1. buy a like-for-like replacement for him (or the closest option available), or 2. look to strengthen the squad as a whole.

Like-for-like:

There are very few like-for-like replacements possible for Luis Suarez. After Ronaldo and Messi, he is right now probably the most dynamic and lethal attacking player in the world of football. Which means that Liverpool will have to settle for the someone who is a somewhat inferior version of Suarez. Money may not be an issue if Real Madrid shell out £50 million for Suarez, but attracting a top class player when you’re not even playing in Europe is another matter. Which is why names like Carlos Tevez are popping up in the grapevine. Tevez is exactly the kind of poor-man’s-Suarez Liverpool might need to settle for. He has all the 3 attributes listed above, though in somewhat scarcer volumes than Suarez. He is also 29 years old with a history of indiscipline.

Strengthening the squad:

Plan B would be to strengthen the squad so that those three qualities can be derived from multiple players on the pitch. This isn’t Moneyball logic we’re talking about here; not is this to build a case for buying three different players to match those three respective qualities of Suarez. However, by building a stronger overall team you can overcome the loss of a star player. The team as a whole would then fill the void left by an individual. For example, Rodgers used a front three of Sturridge-Suarez-Downing to good effect last season. To accommodate Suarez’s departure, he would firstly need a finisher who can score goals, but is also good on the ball. Which would explain why someone like the Colombian Luis Muriel (currently playing for Udinese) has been linked with the club.

Liverpool would also need someone more dynamic in Downing’s role, someone with a greater ability to dribble with the ball and who carries greater attacking threat. As Sturridge likes to run towards the center more often than not, this player should arguably be someone who is a more natural winger, and will therefore be able to give the team some depth. While Cristian Eriksen’s name has been touted time and again as a possible target, he would surely not be the best fit for this role.


Eriksen may not be a priority buy if Suarez departs

Eriksen is more of a central attacking midfielder who can also be deployed on the wings than a natural wide-man; his entry would probably just force Coutinho onto the bench. Seeing how well Coutinho has been progressing, Eriksen or even Henrikh Mkhitarayan (another Coutinho-esque player, currently with Shakhtar Donetsk) should not be the priority.

Keep calm and keep scouting

It is a worrying thought to ponder that when Sturridge and Coutinho were brought in, Rodgers was building a team that revolved around Suarez to a large degree. It is easy to imagine all of Rodgers’ plans crumbling now that the Liverpool no. 7 has voiced his wish to leave. However, it is important to remember that Suarez was never purchased to play alongside Fernando Torres. The same Torres who, at the time, had seemed like Liverpool’s most important player, and without whom the team was thought be doomed. The same Torres who, in the same transfer window, left the club for bluer pastures. Look how that worked out. Torres’s reputation has dwindled to a mere fraction of what it was, and Suarez is now being looked upon as one of the best footballers in the world. It’s a great case study on the wonders of the transfer window.

true,kyhadley,null,null,"&gt;So much for Lazar Markovic joining Chelsea anytime soon. There's always been an odd disparity between what the English and Portuguese media were saying about the Partizan Belgrade forward, and it looks like the latter are going to win this battle: A Bola is reporting that Markovic is currently in Lisbon to take a medical.

&gt;Apparently, Markovic is set to sign a five-year deal with the Portuguese giants/perennial European losers, and although some have portrayed this as a step towards an eventual move to Chelsea, it's going to result in a very pricey transfer if he develops with Benfica. And if he doesn't, he's not going anywhere.

&gt;My guess is that Chelsea were going to pull the old 'you're going on loan for a couple of years' trick, which is entirely sensible given Markovic's current ability and the talent we have stockpiled in his position. If playing time for his parent club is important, Benfica are a better club for Markovic than the Blues, and he's made the right decision.

&gt;That's speculation, of course -- maybe Chelsea decided they didn't want him after all, or Benfica offered more money to Partizan -- but it makes sense enough. Regardless, Markovic, despite rumours that he'd signed with us back in January, doesn't look like he's

Oh that's easy - no where then.

&gt; And it pains me to see someone saying that we shouldn't try to cure cancer, since we can't possibly cure all types. That is, effectively, what you're saying.

Nope - I am saying we should cure cancer, but for gods sake don't let politicians be the ones deciding how to.

My other choice is Morrisons, both places do a decent range of semi-ready meals... e.g. 2 chicken breasts with something. This has made dinners during the week really quick, easy and healthy. Typically I'll share something like [this](http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/index.jsp?bmUID=1370853463250) with the wife and have lentils or veg with it.

Morrisons is the worst place to go shopping when you're hungry or hungover... their deli &amp; pie selection is very dangerous. I'll often end up scoffing a load of pasties and pakoras :)",0,1370853762,null,0,false,0,cafsc58,t3_1fwivs,t1_cafsc58,t3_1fwivs,null,1430863716,2,false,FitnessUK,t5_2xgyy,2
