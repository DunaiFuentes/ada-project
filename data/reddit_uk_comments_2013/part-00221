true,Vried,null,null,"&gt;  American prisons are run with an iron fist and they have fewer compliance issues and incidents of violence than we do.

The sheer amount of gang problems in American prisons seems to go against your claim. [Here](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/gangs/prison.html) is information on the main gangs active and their presence in just one state. Worthy of note is how many have ties to violence and drugs. Whilst mentioning drugs the same site has a report on [substance abuse](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/subabuse/inmates/09-10/index.html) within US prisons. There have been [studies](http://www.bop.gov/news/research_projects/published_reports/cond_envir/oreprcrim_2br.pdf) dealing with gang culture and violence  in US prisons and several that looks into the issue of [violence](http://cad.sagepub.com/content/41/3/317.short) in  American prisons. The horrid conditions and constant threat of violence are also mention in this [article](http://uk.lifestyle.yahoo.com/cockroaches--violence-and-mouldy-meat--life-in-a-us-jail.html) by a former inmate. A prison commission [report](http://www.vera.org/pubs/confronting-confinement) deals specifically with the levels of abuse and violence in American prisons (See also: [this study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=73426)). One paper actually goes as far as stating outright that ""[American prisons promote violence](http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/22/p125Specter.pdf)"". I've had an issue comparing this to UK prisons as with the exception of an [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/gang-violence-out-of-control-in-feltham-prison-8698500.html) about Feltham prison the other figures I can find suggest that on average thereare [42 incidents of violence](http://www.dodsmonitoring.com/downloads/Misc_Files/Prison_Violence-April2013.pdf) everyday in  UK prisons. American prisons don't seem to publish the rates of violence but there are some suggestions that US Prisons are, at least, just as violent as British prisons - In America ""[As recently as 1980, the murder rate in prison was nearly five times as great as in the general population.](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-21-prisondeaths_N.htm)"". There are no specific stats on prisoner on staff violence, if you know of any I'd be intrigued to read them.

Rape isn't uncommon within American prisons. One paper concludes that ""[Sexual violence inside prison is an urgent public health issue](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438589/)"". [This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sean-mcelwee/incarceration-america_b_3528901.html) article gives some statistics:

&gt;An estimated 217,000 American prisoners are raped each year. That's 600 new victims every day.

Hell, the American prison system is where the term rape culture originated.

Even if American prisons had fewer compliance issues or incidents of violence (Which studies and reports suggest isn't the case) we should still aim to avoid that style as:

&gt;As reported on BBC Radio 4 on 2 September 2005, the recidivism rates for released prisoners in the United States of America is 60% compared with 50% in the United Kingdom. The report attributed the lower recidivism rate in the UK to a focus on rehabilitation and education of prisoners compared with the US focus on punishment, deterrence and keeping potentially dangerous individuals away from society.

So the offering of courses  and such to our inmates seems to be beneficial. In one US prison (Rikers Island in NY) inmates that take horticulture class are less likely to re-offend as detailed in James Jiler's [book](http://www.newvillagepress.net/book/?GCOI=97660100669140). As such I'd argue the arts classes or psychology lessons are, in fact, a good thing.

So to try to tie this together: American prisons are hotbeds of violence, sexual violence, gangs and drugs. There isn't really any evidence to suggest they are any better than UK prisons. I'd also like to conclude by nothing that a [study](http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/22/p125Specter.pdf) pointed out that:

&gt;American prisons promote violence and abuse by their design and
operation.

So I'm somewhat wary of your claims that the way American prisons are run has any positive affect on rates of violence or compliance issues.",0,1382329153,null,0,1382332000,0,ccw4ip2,t3_1ouft9,t1_ccw4ip2,t1_ccvxzqz,null,1429044293,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

i agree although it is not for everyone.

comedians these days are nothing on the old ones like tommy cooper, blackadder, monty python,  etc that kids could watch and enjoy as well as adults. 

US comedians are great too - Bill Hicks, Richard Pryor, Patton Oswalt, Mitch Hedburg  -all whom I think are better than Eddie Izzard. 

These days you have Mickey Flanagan who is quite funny, and Paul Merton who is excellent. A lot of BRitish humour has become cruel and dark like Frankie Boyle or just downright shit like David Mitchell. 

A note to US people. Don't say monty Py THON it should rhyme with hyphen 

Monty Pythen therefore would be the better pronunciation

The first is standard practice, has been happening for years, it's textbook economics.  The second is clearly bollocks, but makes for good newspaper articles, either that or London property is becoming even more of a bubble than previously thought.

TL;DR: Speculation either ends up being right, and the properties being bought by the speculators pay for themselves, in which case it was going to happen anyway; or the speculator was wrong, and the market is only moving because of other speculators, a limit will be reached and the bubble will pop.  Speculation in itself can't cause permanent market movements - although temporary movements can still last a long time.",0,1382338119,null,0,false,0,ccw6t2t,t3_1otp7o,t1_ccw6t2t,t1_ccvur7z,null,1429043053,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But Edinburgh...have you been before?  It's a beautiful city but compared to places like Toronto and London (I'm originally a Londoner) it can feel a bit small after a while and lacking for things to do at times. This is especially true of the evenings when everything starts to shut down from 10pm and you are used to everything being open all night!  The fringe though is a welcome break and will definitely keep you entertained throughout all of August, you also have the Military Tattoo, various film festivals, book festivals, science festivals and the Christmas markets dotted throughout the year. 

Also where are you looking to live? The housing varies dramatically based on where you are living.  City centre is mostly tenements and town houses which can get pricy, further out from the centre and you get more parks and bigger flats/houses.  I used to live in Haymarket which is fantastic for convenience but now I'm in oxgangs/colinton with the pentlands just a short walk away and I love having the open space. 

The weather here, be prepared for cold wet autumns and winters.  Summers are better albeit humid at times (I think the wet is a year round thing) compared to the rest of Scotland though the summers here are much warmer and generally better (around 25 degrees). Summer in say Aberdeen basically means anytime when the sun makes an appearance - seriously, seen people there knee deep in snow and they are wearing t-shirts and shorts because the sun is out.

The independence referendum, isn't really a massive concern, you get a few hardcore scots blathering on about independence and the asshole englishmen but the majority are against it, plus somewhere like Edinburgh where its so multicultural, can't exactly see independence as a good thing if it can potentially drive out half the city.  

Jobwise what are you planning to do in Edinburgh? Be prepared for a possible commute to Glasgow.  I'm at uni here and also work in finance so everything is within the city for me. However if I want to go for work based on my original science degree, most of the jobs are either on the outskirts or i have a commute to other cities. I have a friend here who is a partner at a law firm and she has to travel between Edinburgh and London on an almost weekly basis. 

I would heartily recommend a holiday in Edinburgh first to scope the areas you would like to live in and see where you would potentially be working.

FYI The proposed strike price for renewables under the CfD only lasts 15 years and then the price drops to whatever the current market rate is. Also note that within 5 years the strike price will be cut. The plan is that as the renewables industry becomes more mature the subsidies are cut, hence wave and tidal have large subsidies now whilst onshore wind, with it being more mature has a lower subsidy. The race within renewables is to cut costs faster than the subsidies are removed. This is resulting in a very fast drop in the cost of energy.  

What's been agreed with regards to Nuclear is a strike price that is guaranteed for 40 years or more. So they'll never see a drop to the market rate.

Basically you fix one team (e.g., Spurs), and for every other side you compare the similar fixtures and results that have been played.

So for example: we just played Villa away and won 2-0, the other sides to go there this year are Liverpool (2-1 win), Newcastle (1-0 win) and Man City (3-2 loss). This would give Liverpool and Newcastle 0 points each and City -3. I also give Villa -3 points since they lost to us.

You add up the results for every fixture the team has played and total the points. Using this so far (without properly checking it) I have us 3 points behind West Ham, Arsenal and Hull, and 1 point behind Southampton and Newcastle.

However we only have 1 or 2 similar games with nearly all teams, but that will fill in as the season progresses.

There was nothing about his behaviour that freedom of speech comes even close to.

But he was being incredibly passive aggressive, nothing about that behaviour is acceptable in freedom of speech. 

I find it amazing how you find it okay to defend racists and oppressors, when these oppressors would be the FIRST people to take away all our freedoms. Don't you see this? 

I agree the government implementing legislation against racism might be considered slightly oppressive, but these arguments are based on nothing more then ignorance and hatred! There is no valid reason for them to be allowed in ANY civilised society. It might seem like a contradiction, but it's not when his being aggressive based on completely irrational thought and total ignorance.

Views and ignorance are two very different things. It's now about agreeing with him, it's about making him understand what his saying is totally baseless.   What part of him being arrested for assulting others is government oppression. He was the initial oppressor.

If it's the latter two, take a look at [Ebico](https://www.ebico.org.uk/), a not-for-profit energy supplier, or [Co-operative Energy](http://www.cooperativeenergy.coop/), which belongs to the Midcounties Co-operative and as such divides all yearly profit amongst its members (which would include you, if you joined).

Neither of them are the absolute cheapest you can get, but they're not that expensive either. Comparing Ebico's prices to those of other companies is a bit of a pain in the ass, as they don't do a yearly standing charge and instead charge more per unit of energy. This probably means that if you use little energy Ebico will be cheaper than other providers, if you use a lot it will be more expensive.

true,avro,,Famigilia Leeds United,"Largely I agree with your analysis. However I do think there were some nail biting defensive moments. Header off the line etc. 

The 3-5-2 does enable the midfield some real creativity in terms of movement and I do agree that the interlinked passing between the front men and midfield was at times very nice to watch.

Rudy continues to be an absolute general of the midfield playing more than one killer ball numerous times. Luke Murphy looked confident and assured on the ball and was a go-to outlet for the defense.

Wooton was composure personified, I have no issues with his performance. Warnock got forward. With byram back we looked good. My only issue was pearce who makes me nervous at times. I'd hazard a guess this is why Zaliukas is on trial. A bit of competition looks good for our CBs.

true,cbfw86,uk,South West London,"There are no smaller suppliers who will save you considerable money.

Energy requires infrastructure to be delivered. You either own that infrastructure and pay the maintenance and upgrade costs on it, which is passed on to the consumer's bill. Or you pay for all of that by renting capacity, with added administrative fees and renting premiums. Ever noticed how having a Virgin Media telephone line is more expensive than a BT line? BT can cut their prices and give their customers a better deal and shift the costs over to Virgin Media customers. Price of an engineer call out on BT ~£50. Price of an engineer call out on Virgin ~£70.

Then there's the standard wholesale energy price which you can't escape.

Basically, small companies will be more expensive than the Big Six. There's no economies of scale to keep supply chain costs down and shore up profit margins, so small companies don't really offer a good deal, particularly on energy. Even if they aren't more expensive, it'll be more hassle than it's worth for the meagre savings you'll make.",0,1382348408,null,0,false,0,ccw89gs,t3_1ow1rl,t1_ccw89gs,t3_1ow1rl,null,1429042374,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,stilldontknow2,null,null,"If you've worked there 3 and a half years you have a lot of rights, including the right to take them to industrial tribunal should your meeting end up in termination. 

At your meeting you should ask what the purpose of the meeting is. Is it for the purpose of investigation or discipline? If it's the latter then you should have received, in writing, prior to the meeting, a letter giving a statement of the allegation, details of any investigation, with evidence that's been gathered and what the range of sanction is regarding the allegation. If dismissal is a possible outcome of the hearing you should be advised of that. You should be advised of your right to have a witness, generally a colleague or union rep if you have one, and what appeal process is in place subsequent to any decision. If it is an investigation hearing there is no right for you to have a witness present and no disciplinary decision should be taken at that point although they can decide, at that point, whether there are grounds to proceed to a later disciplinary hearing. It's a good idea to ask for a copy of the company handbook, if you don't already have one, and it should include the disciplinary and grievance process they should be following. 

Don't make the assumption that because you've been suspended you're definitely going to be dismissed, it's just good practice to suspend in matters where dismissal is a possible outcome. 

During your meeting be calm, listen, make sure there is a verbatim record being taken and that you will be able to review that record. Usually you're required to sign such a record to agree it's an accurate account of what happened at the meeting. 

Before making a decision the person chairing the hearing should take sufficient time to consider what's been said and the evidence relating to the case before moving to decide whether they feel there is sufficient grounds to find against you and what sanction, if any, is appropriate. Bear in mind they only have to consider on the balance of probabilities rather than reasonable doubt so there is a lower burden of proof than in criminal matters.

Once a decision has been given this should be confirmed in writing stating the grounds, the sanction and any appeal process. Failure by the company to follow these steps can be viewed as contributing to an unfair dismissal by any subsequent tribunal. Take a note of any of the steps they don't follow and mention them in any appeal letter should they decide to take action against you. make them aware that you know enough about your rights that failure to address the issues could lead to them having to justify their actions to a tribunal. 

Good luck and keep your chin up.

true,Estagon,null,null,"Another tourist here.. I'm a 19-year old Belgian and we have the biggest number of members of any (foreign) Chelsea supporter's club. We attend home games and exciting away games with ~50 people (1 full coach). Any other game would be with max. 10 (maximum spots available in the minivan).

We always sit in Shed Upper (Gate 3/4). 

**1) Blaming the tourists is not right.**

I'm giving you a view of the experiences I have when going to games. (I attend max. 8 matches a year, most of them are away games.)

Let's say 10/50 know all chants and are actively singing along when they are started. Another 15 join in when they know the words. 25 are just there for the football and are first-timers (I accept this, they paid 50£ to see football and if they don't want to sing, they are still supporting the club in their own way.) 

Everybody arounds us obviously knows we are tourists, as we are talking another language, but they don't really care, because we do make some noice, especially for Hazard &amp; de Bruyne. 

I had two bad experiences of all the games I went to : 

- Fulham Away (last year) : I was pretty drunk and was screaming my lungs out, a lot of people were singing, but the man (50-60yrs) next to me was so annoyed with me.. Just because I was singing (with a different accent ofcourse). He asked me : ""Is this how you support our team, screaming your 'fucking' lungs out?"" I asked him : ""I guess, what do you want me to do?"". He told me to act normal. 

- Cardiff City (this saturday) : I was sitting in the SU but there were two guys sitting few rows above me. (I randomly talked to them just before the game). They were ST-holders for about 20-25 years. They didn't even cheer for a goal, they just kept sitting. They left 10 minutes before the end because the game was already won. Okay, I get it, you've been there for 20 years, but even then I wouldn't leave 10 minutes on forehand because the game is already won. 


I feel like the older generation is blaming the younger generation for being either 1. too active or 2. so-called gloryhunters, as in the only reason you are here is because we won titles and cups over the years. 

Maybe I'm just unlucky sitting around people of the older generation or I just had bad luck in those two matches. When I went to WHU away last year I was surrounded by a bunch of guys in their late-20's and I never had so much fun before. They kept singing all game long, learnt me some new chants and even helped me to pronounce them 
in the right way. 

I don't blame anyone right here, because everyone has the right to support Chelsea in his own way, but I feel like the older generation are holding the younger ones back to support their team in their own way. I don't tell you to stand up and sing, so you don't tell me to sit down and shut up. 

**2) The acoustics are horrific**

It is impossible for the ones of the Shed to hear the ones singing from the MH stand. Because of this the Shed and MH are never synced. If this would be the case, it would sound louder and we might even keep on going.

This is just my view and I don't want to offend anyone, especially not the older fans, who have been there all their lives. We respect you, but please respect us too!

true,bad_jew,null,null,"I just moved from Toronto to Edinburgh a month ago for a job. It actually looks like there's a lot of us. Here are my impressions:

1) The beauty is incomparable. I get to walk through an amazing park every day and halfway through I get an amazing glimpse of the Castle. There is lots of architectural variation, and walking a bit in either direction leads to a new neighborhood. From almost anywhere you can see some amazing, rolling hills. 

2) This place is SMALL. 40 minutes on the Go Train gets you to Port Credit if you're lucky and no one threw themselves on the tracks. 40 minutes on the train here gets you to Glasgow. 

3) Housing is about equal to downtown Toronto after taking into account all the extras (council tax and gas/electric). Finding a place without UK references is a bit of a pain, so be prepared to have enough for at least 2 months deposit + your first month. 

4) Shopping is very inconvenient compared to Toronto. Stores open late and close early and have very limited selection. The biggest difference is in grocery stores, most of which are the equivalent of small corner groceries in Toronto. 

4a) Fuck, fruits and vegetables are expensive. I mean, I get its a cold, frozen island in the middle of the northern atlantic, but really. 

5) The food isn't as good (sorry for saying this, everyone). Edinburgh has plentiful pup fare and street curry and some pretty good higher-end places, but there's nothing in the middle: good meals for around $8-12. They have no concept of 'spicy' here. I once asked someone selling a curry if he had anything hot: he just looked down in shame.  

6) other people have mentioned the weather. It doesn't seem to get as cold as Toronto, but there is much more intermediate rain. Few huge storms, just drizzles throughout the day.  

7) There are fewer....I don't know what you'd call it....speciality stores? I used to live in the Annex, and I miss having a great comic book store, several great bookstores, a few specialized groceries, a hardware store, and a dozen other things I need within a few blocks. I find myself going much farther afield to get what I need.

So much was disposed, yet the supervisor insisted on not decreasing the amount of food we put onto the counters, so that they always looked well stocked and full.

After a few weeks of this I couldn't stand seeing so much wasted food, most of which was still perfectly edible. I just followed my own reduction policy, which consisted of making sure it all got sold before the end of the day. If it meant flogging a steak to a passerby at 10% original price 5 minutes before closing, then that was fine.

true,Mozza215,lfcflame,,"You've got the right ideas in here but you really need to improve your writing style. You don't use enough punctuation, meaning your writing doesn't really ever flow like I want it to when I'm reading. 

For example: ""Joe Allen arrived with a £15m price tag over him and comments about how he’s ‘The Welsh Xavi’ and that looked true in his first few games at the club after a MOTM performance in the 2-2 draw vs. City but since then he hasn’t looked like a solid midfielder and with the same problem as Aspas he’s not very big for a midfielder.""

That sentence is way way way too long. Break it down some; add more info in places: ""Joe Allen arrived at Anfield for £15m in the Summer of 2012 as Brendan Rodgers' first signing as Liverpool boss. A hefty price-tag and comments about how he’s ‘The Welsh Xavi’ put pressure on the young Welshman, but he looked like a shrewd signing in his first few games at the club, earning a MOTM award for his performance in the 2-2 draw against Manchester City. Injury problems have blighted Allen since the middle of last season, meaning his growth into the player Rodgers believes he can be has drastically slowed. However, as his return from a shoulder injury grows ever closer, there seems to be much anticipation from Liverpool supporters to see if Allen can regain the form shown at the start of last season."" It's not great because I could probably add some more stats to fill it out instead of stuff most people already know, but you get the idea.

Don't rush your points. Analyse the things you want to say. Does it all make sense? Does my writing flow? Am I saying stuff most people already know? If you're answering yes to the last one, do some research, produce some facts and stats most people **won't** know. You've got to put the effort in for writing such as this, and I think with a bit more research and reasoning this article could have been much better. As you've said though, this is your first and it's clear you want to improve, and I'm sure you will if you take on board the advice in the comments here :)

true,TheGeorge,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire cat.,"Just because it is an assumption doesn't automatically make it less valid (though it often is) especially when the assumption is based on logic. 

We don't know (no actual data) but we do know a few things which can make the assumption more likely than not.  In countries with legalised or decriminalisation of the drug there is known average higher quality product,  there have been seizures of poor quality product in countries where illegal,  the risk of selling makes dealers worry more about clearing stock than customer satisfaction or quality. 
When supply is lower than demand an inferior product can be sold as other options are expensive or in lower supply. 

For legal products with known illegal bootlegs,  if the quality is equivalent to cost then the legal version tends to sell better,  especially in drugs market. 

I have tried quality of the good stuff and if it was available easily I'd choose that every time. 

That justify my assumption?

If the Doctor helped out protesters, it was more than likely for other reasons. I mean, big scary alien reasons. Tea has always had a sort of big role in the show. The Doctor has used it frequently to combat poisons (Unicorn and the Wasp, as well as The Lodger) and help him through regeneration (Christmas Invasion). You can totally imagine that some alien did something to the water and the Doctor was like, ""Let's just fix this with a nice salty cuppa.""

Seriously... how can you not imagine the Doctor crashing a meeting at Faneuil Hall while Sam Adams tries to calm the angry colonists over the Tea Act and being like, ""We need to empty all the tea on those ships into the harbor five minutes ago!"" and everyone is like ""Who are you?"" and the Doctor does his usual ""I'm the Doctor, now come on, move it - don't you wanna dump all that tea in the ocean just to piss off ol' George?"" and before Sam Adams could restore order to the meeting a few dozen of them had already left to join the Doctor. And then unbeknownst to anyone but the Doctor, the tea neutralized some poison some alien had released in the water.

If I were a writer from the UK who liked to poke fun at the US, this is how I would take the piss out of the Boston Tea Party.

     I dont know much about him, other than the stats from the article.

He's a force going forward but his lack of effort and ability to time tackles has cost us one or two chances every time he plays.  A good team would capitalize on that.

1. If you drink every day you willl clearly be taking your calories in liquid form; therefore you'll be hungry, Eat more, but sensible foods.
2. Sugar. There's a fuckton in every pint and your body will crave it. A bit of choc or a biscuit won't do you any harm.
4. The ability to count might go. Did you see superman where he sees everything? Well being long term sober is sort of like that. You can take more in but get more distracted.
5. An end date - if you are focused on that you'll get there, maybe, and then you'll go batshit and boy will you feel bad the next day - putting booze into a cleaned body is like putting diesel into a petrol motor. I now don't tell people what my plans are so no peer pressure (that and I'm 42 so I am old and ugly enough to be a miserable shit and just tell them to fuck off). Best times for me were on the day I had a couple of beers with my wife and fell asleep feeling all snuggly.
6. peer pressure. Seriously tell anyone that asks more than once to fuck off. They're not being funny, ironic or clever; they're being dicks.
7. 'becoming a better person'. Don't expect miracles. None of us are perfect and we all have a multitude of sins; I am a lazy bastard when it comes to DIY as much sober as sozzled. 
8. Don't have a big last night. Wind down gradually. Otherwise you end up worshipping and demonising booze which is more unhealthy than not drinking it. It's a social lubricant and used for winding down; thats it. Don't make it into a God - you never win against Gods.

Evidently Mata is clearly lacking that extra yard of pace, and with work on your calves, interval sprinting, and maybe a little bit of diet (not saying he's fat) you can be explosive in your game.

With that in mind, I culled out the points other teams took from games with the top 8, and got this breakdown.

**Club**  **Opponents' Points**

Arsenal	**66**

Chelsea	**80**

Liverpool	**64**

Man City	**75**

Tottenham	**75**

Southampton	**61**

Everton	**82**

Man Utd	**78**

This puts the starts of each team into a bit more perspective. Everton have actually had the toughest opening slate, playing only 3 teams on less than 10 points so far, and 2 of the other top 8. United, who's dropped points more often than Everton are put into perspective, since their ""SoS"" has been contributed to significantly by 3 losses (City, Liverpool, and West Brom)

As to Arsenal &amp; Liverpool, yes they've had an easier time of things, but not as easy as Southampton, who should fall back into the middle of the pack.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"I disagree. Brendan got it tactically wrong against Pardew (whom I think is not the best tactical manager) by staying with the 3-5-2 and letting Moses play behind the strikers, having Gerrard and Lucas isolated against 4 Newcastle midfielders which led to us being overun in the middle of the park.

Last season at Anfield, Clarke chose to play his side extremely defensively. He knew that we had trouble breaking disciplined defensive lineups up and we were weak on the counter/set pieces. IIRC they ended up scoring from a corner and a counter and succesfully managed to keep a clean sheet. This has nothing to do with 'it being one of those days' because if this were the case, we would be having a lot of 'those days'. Clarke simply is a very good defensive manager and knew our weaknesses perfectly which is exactly why they won at Anfield. 

Now onto this season: What has changed regarding our weaknesses? Nothing! Are we still struggling to break up disciplined defences? Without Coutinho certainly. 
IMO the game can go two ways: Either Coutinho is fit and back and performs very well after a lengthy absence and we win (which is very unlikely) or WBA will defend very strongly and manage to score 1-2 goals via set pieces (far more likely). 

You are free to think whatever you want about Clarke and his tactics and our inability to control the midfield and break up strong defences, but I won't get my hopes up for the next two games and expect 2 losses.

&gt; EDF - or whoever - can prove, definitively, that it offers the best deal to customers in London (where it has roughly a 74% market share at the moment). So why does EDF not advertise this? 

To do so would be to risk starting a price war. It is massively against their interests to start a price war. Why would they do so when customers aren't demanding one?

&gt; EDF, in a single stroke, swallows up more than half of the 25% of London bills it doesn't already have. Money for old rope, really. 

Until the other suppliers realise they’ve lost all their customers and are forced to lower their prices, and advertise it to win them back. They won't participate a price war unless they have to. The only way to make them is to actually vote with our feet.

&gt;The problem with your argument presupposes that there is a cheapest supplier, 

There will always be a cheapest supplier for any given household. 

&gt;or that the companies have an interest in assuming there is. 

I don’t see why.

&gt;there are around 500 different tariffs you can get in this country. They know exactly what they're doing. They make pricing as opaque as possible, knowing that few people have the wherewithal to pursue the data, make sense of it and hunt it all down for the sake of saving £30 a year.

People have the wherewithal, they just don’t use it. They would rather moan than go to uswitch.com, moneysupermarket.com, comparethemarket.com or any of the dozens of other sites that will help them save money. It’s really not that complicated.

My old dad's a wise man, and he's blaming Ed Miliband for all this.

Consider: There is a reasonable chance that the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition will be voted out next time, and Ed, or his party if they kick him out before then, are likely to be the main beneficiaries of that change in power.

Now, who announced that he would fix prices as soon as he got into power? Our pal Ed.

true,guernican,null,null,"""It is massively against their interests to start a price war."" 

This is precisely the point that most of my argument is geared towards demonstrating. 

""Until the other suppliers realise they’ve lost all their customers and are forced to lower their prices, and advertise it to win them back.""
""There will always be a cheapest supplier for any given household. "" 
""People have the wherewithal, they just don’t use it."" 

And herein lies the point. For me, your answer always contains the apologia for the corporation in question. It's fine for them to have complex, byzantine tariffs, because people will do the research to find out how they can save £15. It's ok that they don't make the effort to drop prices, whether as loss-leader or as a more genuine expression of what the fuel costs them, because we should be moving around from one to the other to keep them on their toes. 

Whereas actually, it's perfectly possible for them to create a simpler tariff system. It's just not in their interest to do so. 

It would be a matter of cutting profits for a quarter or two - I stress profits, and they consistently return 5-10% quarter to quarter, which we'll come back to - to deliver a massive boost in customers in a relatively short space of time. This is trickier, because ultimately a company's responsibility to its shareholders is to maximise profit. In this instance, though, it's far more in everyone's interest to maintain the current status quo. 

I keep returning to what, for me, is the ultimate issue here: that free market economics are absolutely super when you can choose to decide whether or not you buy the product. Your biscuit analogy makes sense if we're talking about biscuits. I could also, if I wanted, not buy biscuits at all. Or buy Duchy Originals, or economy Rich Tea. 

This is simply not true of an essential service. To follow your analogy through: why do supermarkets cut prices? Brcause they've overbought stock. Or because they're opening a new store, or responding to lower sales in a region, or as part of a wider initiative to steal customers. Supermarkets invest in competitive advertising. They 'prove' to you that your shop would have cost more in Aldi, or Sainsburys, or wherever. 

Energy companies do not, because they don't give a shit whether your taste runs to Clubs, Penguins or Bourbon Creams. They're only selling one thing, and it makes virtually everything in your life work.   

Finally, I'd point you towards moneysavingexpert.com, who unsurprisingly are running a ""beat the price rises"" editorial. I'd urge you to have a browse around and see how little you can save, compared from company to company. In most cases, looking over a 4-year period and comparing suppliers, you're looking at less than £100 difference between these 6 companies. That in itself should tell you something: that truly canny people making the effort to do all this research are saving themselves £20-£30 a year.

Agger made a mistake vs Southampton, Enrique vs United, Toure misjudged his header yesterday while Cissokho allowed Newcastle's player to run blind side. Worryingly it appears most of our team makes mistakes in these situations, except Skrtel it must be said. 

That makes the inevitable move back to a back 4 all the more tricky, Skrtel has been in brilliant form and is our best header, but is very uncomfortable with the ball. Sakho and Toure have been playing well, while Agger is the most suited to our defence but has been making silly errors. Will be interesting to see who Rodgers chooses.

For a long time on here everyone criticised our delivery / ability to score from set pieces but in the past few weeks it has been evident that even with good delivery and poor marking we've failed to capitalise. Toure, Sakho and Skrtel all failed to put free headers on target, while Newcastle scored from their one good delivery! It always irked me when fans said Gerrard had poor delivery, it is actually excellent (he is one of the highest creators from set pieces in the league, it's just we have so many that occasionally he is going to hit a poor one). When Gerrard plays for England they score set pieces so frequently it suggests to me our players simply aren't good at taking advantage of these situations (Agger isn't bad though).",0,1382369197,null,0,false,0,ccwcq4h,t3_1owfpl,t1_ccwcq4h,t3_1owfpl,null,1429040292,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

He gets up early and really hangs in the air, plus he's so strong that he doesn't really get pushed around at all.  He brutally manhandled Altidore against Sunderland and for all the things that Jozy is or is not, he's a very strong and physically powerful/imposing forward.  I'm looking forward to seeing how he handles players like Lukaku and Benteke because I think he's our answer to the problem we had big big, powerful center forwards last season.

Our set piece woes are extremely frustrating for sure.  I think it's something that can be adjusted for in training on both ends of the pitch.  Personnel wise we shouldn't be having the issue we're having with set piece delivery defensively at all.  I feel like defensively is a matter of organization and each player understanding their role in defending the free kick that comes in.  Our The mistakes from Enrique and Gerrard were strange, it looked like both of them were confused and expecting one of their teammates to be there even though the ball came into areas that were clearly their zones.  Cissokho's mistake looked more like a lack of concentration than anything.

It's always more difficult to win the set piece when you're the team that's attacking, but with the power of Sakho and Skrtel in the air you'd expect us to do better there.  Sturridge isn't exactly small either.

&gt;**What constitutes spam?**

&gt;It's a gray area, but some rules of thumb:

&gt;* It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.
* **If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer. If over 10% of your submissions are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.**
* If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam.
* If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. But we're serious about the ""not people you asked to go vote for you"" part.
* If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, give it a shot. But don't flood the new queue; submit one or two times and see what happens.

&gt;To play it safe, write to the moderators of the community you'd like to submit to. They'll probably appreciate the advance notice. They might also set community-specific rules that supersede the ones above. And that's okay -- that's the whole point of letting people create their own reddit communities and define what's on topic and what's spam.

That's why I'm quitting out right as of 28/10/13.

&gt; Sugar. There's a fuckton in every pint and your body will crave it. A bit of choc or a biscuit won't do you any harm.

I have enough sugar on a daily basis, I've cut back massively in the last month or so. One sugar in the tea, four teas a day... that's it.

&gt; The ability to count might go. Did you see superman where he sees everything? Well being long term sober is sort of like that. You can take more in but get more distracted.

I thought it was the other way around? Alcohol is a creative drug right?

&gt; An end date - if you are focused on that you'll get there, maybe, and then you'll go batshit and boy will you feel bad the next day - putting booze into a cleaned body is like putting diesel into a petrol motor. I now don't tell people what my plans are so no peer pressure (that and I'm 42 so I am old and ugly enough to be a miserable shit and just tell them to fuck off). Best times for me were on the day I had a couple of beers with my wife and fell asleep feeling all snuggly.

09:00 01/01/14 is my end date.

&gt; peer pressure. Seriously tell anyone that asks more than once to fuck off. They're not being funny, ironic or clever; they're being dicks.

I intend to. I came out of the Army a few years back and I had a serious drink problem. I cut it off for a few months and every dickhead thought they were funny.

&gt; 'becoming a better person'. Don't expect miracles. None of us are perfect and we all have a multitude of sins; I am a lazy bastard when it comes to DIY as much sober as sozzled.

True. I just want to use this as part of being a better dude. It'll let me loose my weight quicker than if I was drinking.

&gt; Don't have a big last night. Wind down gradually. Otherwise you end up worshipping and demonising booze which is more unhealthy than not drinking it. It's a social lubricant and used for winding down; thats it. Don't make it into a God - you never win against Gods.

Halloween night out is next weekend. I'm wearing enough equipment that night to stop me wanting to drink as it's heavy as hell. I'll have a few (or my usual) and be happy!

I think that mistake vs United was definitely down to Enrique, watch every set piece this season and Gerrard is our first man, he is told to avoid marking too tight since if he stays in his position he has a good chance of heading most near post corners. Simply protect that zone, most teams do something similar. Enrique should have followed Hernandez rather than let him wonder over.

Sturridge is actually really poor in the air, I know he's scored a couple for us but in terms of heading the ball during open play he is awful despite being 6 ft. I can't seem to find it, but their was an article which showed he wins something like 10% of aerial duels, despite being shorter Suarez was around 30%.

Hopefully Rodgers works hard on this, because it can make a significant difference. United didn't score from open play for 5 games yet managed 9 points from those games.

However, it's much easier to be Manchester City and just buy whoever you want than it is to be the Red Sox and have to draft and develop players since most of the best players don't go to free agency anymore and the ones that you do are signed to ridiculously long and debilitating contracts generally past their prime. 

So yes and no. If you're City then it's easier, but if you're West Brom then it's not since at least every MLB team if they draft and scout well can put a competitive team on the field and have some hope of winning a title whereas West Brom are never going to win a title for the sheer reason they don't have as much resources as City or United. 

The Red Sox are one of the bigger MLB teams but still don't have as large a payroll as the Yankees or Dodgers. They also reined in their long term spending last year after giving huge contracts to a bunch of guys who weren't successful but they were able to trade several of them last year and replaced them with guys on shorter deals where they don't get locked into commitments. Not sure if that means anything for Liverpool, mostly I think it's just a reaction to the market in MLB now where the best young players tend to get locked up before they hit free agency and then when they do hit free agency they're 29 or 30 and looking for an 8 year deal which isn't a good investment generally.

(Police action, dismissal, not being able to get a reference etc).  Maybe reherse what you intend to say with a friend- prob best to choose one unconnected with your workplace.

If there is no more evidence against you than anyone else then this could well be discrimination.  TBH if there is no evidence then do not see HOW you can loose your job.     Trouble is if they suspect you / dont like you then a boss can make ones life unpleasant.  Therefore in interview be firm but not rude or unpleasant, stand your ground but dont act like an arsehole ie dont loose your rag.

Quite likely = if there is no evidence then all the employer can do is undertake these interviews in the hope the petty theft stops, kinda a scare tactic.  Might be a case of answering a few basic questions.   So actually dont worry too much.   If the thefts it do not stop then expect other action such as introduction of CCTV.

If you have home insurance (buildings and / or contents) then check to see if ""family legal expenses"" insurance is included - then this generally gives insurance cover (subject to a ton of smallprint INCLUDING EARLY NOTIFICATION) for ""employment contract"" disputes.   If you live with your parents then ask them to check theirs.

Even if they/you do not have the actual insurance cover then they most likely have a legal helpline which you/they  can ring (as many times as you like) for free advice.   Or you might have similar with car insurance or a bank account etc.

It's just that the Moment is fated to be the same. Without it everything is re-written. The 50th could possibly take over and write the gap between the 8th-9th that needs to be placed in the Moment.

As far as the Valeyard theory and other incarnations of the Doctor, there is a few hiccups. The Valeyard was a place to go to. And end goal for the show and storyline to find. Unfortunately after the show was cut off around the 7th Doctor there needed to be a gap filled. The movie created the aforementioned moment. Struggling with the Moment and impending deeds the doctor's end point of the Valeyard was moved around to the step after. John Hurts Doctor is not an incarnation of THE Doctor. Just like the Watcher, Dream Lord, Meta-Crisis Tenth, or The Burner Doctor, the ones that take the name of THE DOCTOR are incarnations that count toward the regeneration's. I like the idea that the 12th doctor could be the Valeyard and that seems to be a good way to toy with the audience. I however feel that they are going to push through the Valeyard story line(as it wasn't exactly popular when it was written) and achieve a new end goal.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"We've scored 3 goals against managerless Sunderland and 3 goals against relegationfodder Crystal Palace. We scored a penalty against Newcastle and a goal against 10 men Newcastle who were missing their best defensive player. Some of them were very good goals but none was scored against a very organized and disciplined defence. This is going to change when we face WBA.

It's true that we don't lose many matches but that's not really the point. Had the game carried one the way it did and they failed to score, we would still have drawn the game. Zero points or 1 point, it doesn't make much of a difference. We did not finish in the middle of the table the last years because we lost too many games but because we drew the games we should definitely be winning. 

Coming back to the WBA loss at Anfield last season: I don't remember all the chances we had but I am pretty sure no chance was a clear-cut chance but most of them were shots from long range which Foster managed to comfortable save. The saved penalty was then of course a 'game changer' since it allowed them to win the game without conceding but had we scored that penalty and carried on the win the game 1-0, it wouldn't have hidden our qualitative deficiencies in breaking open thight defences. I don't know about you but as an aspiring Top 4 team we should be beating middle table teams quite comfortably at Anfield. If we only manage to score via a penalty in these games then the opposition has to be given credit that they used a tactic which perfectly nullified our attacking threat. I once again want to emphasize that Foster did not have to make the sort of saves Begovic was pulling off in our first game of this season. 

There is no shame in admitting that Clarke out-thought Brendan in this one. Brendan is still a young coach, doing lots of mistakes, while Clarke is an experience coach and excells when defensive attributes are needed. 

My personal worry is that Brendan is not going to learn from the Newcastle game and the WBA game last season. He has to approach the game differently in order for us to create enough chances. I am sure that, with SAS on fire, if we manage to get either of them clear on goal, we can score but if WBA restrict us once again to shots from outside the box, we'll struggle once again and may concede on a counter and almost definitely on a set piece. 

If we don't win against mid-table clubs, then we won't finish in the Top 4. I don't care if we win against Arsenal, Chelsea or City but against lesser teams we simply have to win. Last season was the time where tactical mistakes were allowed. This season we cannot repeat those same mistakes.

Some years ago the government basically got the big ISPs around a table and said ""Kiddie porn's a problem. Censor it voluntarily or we'll pass legislation forcing you to.""

The IWF was the result. They maintain a blacklist of pages and every major ISP subscribes to this; anything winding up on the blacklist is blocked.

(Exactly how ""voluntary"" this was is another question altogether - I would argue that at least if the government had passed legislation they'd have had to put in place some sort of process with oversight for the censorship; what we have right now has next to no oversight and how ISPs choose to present a censored page to their customers is up to them. Very few have chosen to flash up a page saying ""Oops, sorry, that's censored""; most instead send a generic HTTP error so it looks like it could be a problem with the website at the other end. This allowed the IWF to fly under most people's radar for years).

I think 9th, 10th, and 11th are probably far older than they seem. 9 probably being the shortest lived. But then again, he did travel a fair bit to turn up in so many photos. So he was probably a lot older than the time he spent with Rose.

I remember seeing a theory about how he met rose right after he regenerated, which is why he was surprised at his reflection, and then at the end of 'rose', when he gets in the tardis, and goes, and comes back. that he actually  went off for a long time, and then thought ""actually if I said its a time machine she might come,"" and popped back.

10th, well, he was probably a lot older than he admitted too. He ran about with rose for a while, then he did whatever for a while before finding martha. and after that, he was kicking about for quite a while before Donna again. And then he did a 'farewell tour'. So we're probably looking at maybe 100 years? At least 50.

11th claims 300 years since he was '900', so he has undoubtedly been running about a lot.

For the most part in American football the left or right side is irrelevant. Offensive linemen are the exception. A left tackle is generally considered to be the most important lineman and is paid as such. Why? Because a defender trying to tackle to quarterback from that side has an advantage. Most quarterbacks are right-handed, and thus their throwing position is [like this](http://www.photo-dictionary.com/photofiles/list/126/416quarterback.JPG). Note: #72 is the left tackle in this image.

It's unpleasant, shouting slurs at people and that guy is a wannabe bully (Anyone who says ""I'm going to knock you out"" isn't really going to do anything) but it doesn't actually stop her going about her day, he hasn't stopped her from getting off at her stop, or talking, or moving away.

She chose not to move away because I dunno? She wasn't that bothered by his drunken musings? or she wanted to make a point of not moving away? I can only speculate, but nothing stopped her going about her day like normal.

Now on the other side of it, he was just going about his day (his day as a twat) as well but none the less, he was going about his day and he was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence. For announcing his racism, not him telling people to physically attack someone or inciting a riot based on someone's race. He was arrested for his (from what I saw what he directed at her atleast) non violent racist comments. So the only person who can't go about their day as a result is him.

There was no need for the 'racially aggravated public order offence' he already crossed the boundary when he threatened to knock out the cameraman, so they could of had him on that without using a law I'm sure should be used only for threatening violent racist comments.

&gt; We live in a ridiculously diverse country and I for one would be more than happy for everyone to merrily go about their day and enjoy their life without fear of being assaulted either verbally or physically for where they happen to be from. or what they happen to believe.

You don't have the right to not be verbally ""assaulted"" or verbally  offended. I find people advocating the infringement of others right to free speech as pretty offensive but that doesn't mean they should go to jail and I wouldn't want them to either.

Two very good chances stand out for me from that match. Henderson's flick that was saved point blank. And gerrard's shot when played in just inside the box that foster got his hand to and Borini should have scored from the rebound.

Same with City, since Everton is the only other top 8 side that has played them.

It's far from perfect, but I think it's a better metric for how teams are doing so far.

true,70prichard,present,,"I have some issues with this article and agree with others.

Ken Bates' Comment: The man sold the club over a decade ago to Roman, most Blues fans would not allow his comments to stop them from supporting their club and I think it is a bit ridiculous to say that his comments have had a long term impact on matchday atmosphere.

Ticket Prices and Tourists: The writer talks about the high prices but then also states that they have been frozen. This is an issue that arises with most large clubs around the world (Germany excluded) and is an effect of the popularity of the game in England. That being said, Tourists really are only getting tickets AFTER season ticket holders and members have been given first chance at buying them. Also Champions League matches are much cheaper, starting around 35 pounds for a match. Tourists get chances to buy those after everyone else, and they do it gladly and most times pay increased prices on third party sites to go. 

Safe Standing Areas: This is not a Chelsea issue, terraces have been banned since Hillsborough and the chances of them coming back are slim. Preston North End has petitioned the FA to do a trial of them and I believe Man City have as well but those were done away with for a reason and chances of it coming back are slim.

Neutral Stand: As Season Ticket holders sit all around the stadium, such an area would take a while to create, with the capacity of the stadium coming in at just under 42,000. Chelsea does not really have the room to accommodate neutral fans. 

Acoustics: They really are bad, the Shed and Matthew Harding never sync up and its obvious in the West and East Stand. Originally Stamford Bridge was going to be renovated with 3 tiered on all sides similar to the East Stand but the club was not able to complete it in the 70's due to financial issues. That being said, any construction or massive changes to the stadium would take more than an off season and the club has no where else it could play so construction will not happen to fix it. 

My thoughts: With Chelsea's increased popularity around the world this was bound to happen. This is occurring at clubs all around the country and Europe. Part of Chelsea's success and revenue stream is from these fans and to not accommodate to a certain extent does not make sense. Also, the new younger football fan does not experience the game in the way that the older generation did, and this is good and bad for different reasons that I dont really have time to put down, but as the game evolves so does the fan, and these growing pains are expected.

Ryan bothered me because he never tweets about working hard - he should be working his absolute cock off to get in the side.  Brian has made it very clear that anyone can get in the side.  Instead he's tweeting about getting paid, suggesting he's in it for the money rather than the club.

That isn't really a bad thing, but Townsend gets to make up for a lot of positioning shortcomings by just blazing down the touch line and running at defenders.  It looks visually more impressive to see Townsend immediately open play up like that, whereas Siggy is finding space and creating chances on the left.  There is a reason that Gylfi has three goals from being in the right place at the right time.

The problem is that with Naughton you have Siggy dropping too far back to create chances.  Naughton doesn't push up enough to put Siggy in play in a forward position.  If every time Siggy receives the ball he 10 yards in Spurs terroritory, it is hard to create successful runs.  Townsend can do those long runs, but that isn't the type of player Gylfi is.

TL;DR  Siggy isn't incapable of covering left, he's having to cover too deep on left.

true,NeverBeBored,null,null,"During my formative years, post-school and pre-university, I worked at an outdoor activity centre at the edge of Llangorse Lake. This was a stunning location, set within the Brecon Beacons National Park and at the foot of the Black Mountains. It was here that my passion for outdoor pursuits really took off, surrounded every day by wild places, fresh air and a simple form of life that has continued to retain its appeal. 

The Black Mountains were a good training ground for the Brecon Beacons, with many long walks over the rough heights of Waun Fach and Mynydd Troed, preparing body and mind for the steep rocky inclines of Pen y Fan and Corn Du. Much as the mountain tops were majestic and inspiring, it was the valleys between that held the real secrets for me of this magical part of Wales. It was the first time I had come close to living within a tight knit rural community, people who welcomed visitors with open arms in return for an honest day's work and had a huge sense of pride in the land they accepted were merely the custodians. 

As a result, the Brecon Beacons remind me most of the summer breeze at the Brecon Jazz Festival and nights out in the local pubs, the Black Mountains bring back memories of lazy days at Llanthony Priory, the Hay-on-Wye book festival and good food in Abergavenny restaurants. 

Yes the mountains and views were always majestic, the hard work and perspiration incurred in getting to the peaks was always well rewarded, but it was the return to humanity and home comforts at the end of the day that made it most worthwhile. So perhaps for me, the greatest lesson from raw nature is that we humans are really no match for it, which is why we crave a much more comfortable life after all! 

This part of South Wales is rich in local heritage as well as natural attractions, and while it is a mostly rural area it is also just a few miles from the Welsh mining valleys which provide a stark contrast to the National Park. There is so much to see that you can easily spend a week or more exploring the area and there are plenty of low cost hotels or self-catering establishments to choose from. While the summer is the obvious time to visit, if you wrap up warm in winter it is beautiful to see the peaks wrapped in snow.

The reason you make comparisons year over year is because that is the only way to judge improvement. We got 0 points against West Brom last season. Getting 3 this weekend would be a 3 point improvement over last. Comparing results year over year is a common way to judge performance in a host of sports, including football.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"Brendan got outmanaged by Clarke. Sitting deep and lurking on the counter is a tactic. Just because WBA used the same tactic over and over again doesn't make it 'not a tactic'. It's still a tactic with which WBA entered the game and got a perfect result. 

Of course top four clubs don't always win against mid table clubs but they should. Your Spurs vs. West Ham is a good example, Arsenal vs. Villa was really a strange game where the referee basically decided that one. 

There were lessons to learn from Southampton, yes. There were also lessons to learn from Crystal Palace and Sunderland. And prior to going into the Newcastle game, knowing very well that their midfield outmuscles ours, we still put Gerrard and Henderson there with Moses behind the two strikers where he is clearly not comfortable. Rodgers adapated the 3-5-2 formation because we lacked a decent right back to play 4 at the back. With Johnson's return, I expected that we go back to 4-2-3-1 where we would have had an easier time in the middle of the park. But we didn't and nearly payed the price. Had Newcastle stayed with 11 men on the field, no doubt would we have lost. This is the lesson to learn from the Newcastle game. 

It's going to be exactly the same against WBA. They have a very strong and dynamic midfield. We will struggle big time against the likes of Mulumbu &amp; co. if Rodgers decides to stick with the 3-5-2 formation.

If you have privatised industries, you imagine that you could get greater investment and lower bonuses if the state removed the profit incentive.

Plus, a lot of people are just ignorant. If you asked people how much of their train ticket was going as profit to the train companies it would be magnitudes of hundreds than the reality. People seem to think our energy costs are too high, whereas in reality we are around the european average.

There are probably some areas where nationalisation would work effectively. There are others where a purely market based approach would be infinitely more effective. The majority will be in the middle, with varying levels of state control.

The defense I'm just kind of winging, I don't know if Zeki is in AVBs plans, but I felt that Walker should be rested, and I'd rather not have Vert out on the left.  

In the midfield, not having Capoue means we kind of need to start one of Sandro and Paulinho I think, and swap Holtby for Eriksen if AVB wants to start Holtby in the league.  And if he thinks that Lamela isn't quite ready yet, I'd like to see him start.  I just want the kid to play.

In the League:

Lloris

Walker - Daw - Vert - Rose

Sandro - Paulinho

Lamela - Eriksen - Townsend

Soldado.

Obviously if Rose isn't fit, I'd lean towards the back line we started Sunday, with Chiriches stepping in and Vert moving to the left.  In the front three of the midfield, Townsend and Lamela are interchangeable, I just want to see them both.  And I still think Eriksen is our best option as a creative force behind Soldado.

Then if it's a big delivery, the management will jump over to help departments who are suffering. Managers don't rumble, ever, leaving older dates pushed to the back where they are forgotten. 

Customers waste around £1,000 a day in our store. From eating food while they walk around the shop an then dumping it, to leaving frozen chips shoved behind the lightbulbs. It happens. 

And every day, fresh food going out of date is reduced by 20% at 11am. 40% at 3pm. 75% at 7pm and 95+% at 9pm. Out of date food only gets binned if it is forgotten about/hidden. We get a lot of pressure to minimise waste but a lot of it is out of the control of staff.

But you don't GET to the big games until you maintain your concentration and do the job you are supposed to do against the smaller sides. Case-in-point, last year we had the best record of any top four team against the other top four teams but we lost the title by 15ish points because we dropped points against sides like QPR (2 points from 6), Southamptom (whom were light-years different from this year's side), etc. 

Luiz is a great athlete with great attributes. But I do not agree he reads the game better. JT comparatively to Luiz has almost no athletic ability. But he's always the first one to win the ball in the air and is great with interceptions and tackling - his speed of thought is miles beyond Luiz. 

I believe in the english-style of play, because I believe that even the most consistent play (call it predictable if you like) isn't stoppable if done right. I believe that in a side like ours, where we field 4 attackers who have close to no interest in winning the ball back once we've lost it - we need very reliable defending.

 Comparing Boateng to Luiz is like apples and oranges. Bayern play a ruthless style, where they hunt in packs to win the ball back - even Robben &amp; Ribery. They rely on a set of rules to defend as a TEAM and don't take unnecessary risks as individuals because they have developed trust and consistency. Each player knows his role in the team and he performs that for the team. This is also a very good reason that they have made 3 out of the last 4 CL finals instead of going from title-holders to the first team ever to not advance from the group-stages the next year on.

Am I blaming all of our problems on Luiz? No - but the attributes that make him a good footballer are not defensive ones.

And thats not to mention the fact that Townsend and Lamela are both predominately right wingers at this point, leaving Siggy has 1 of 2 actual left wingers on our team. And I'm certainly not the only one who thinks he's shown more than Chadli this year.

First, I agree that he is not as good of a winger or a #10 as our other players.  I think with Lennon back and once Chadli and Lamela are settled there will be no need for him on the wings.  Also, I rate Holtby and Eriksen over him.

Saying all that; though, if he is on decently low wages, it may not be bad to keep him as a back up in case we are every in a position again where multiple wingers or one of our #10s are injured.  In this case, I would prefer we give our youth players a shot anyway.

About 80 years ago when American football was making its move to more complex plays and formations, there was a particular formation called [the Wishbone](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1316298/Wishbone_medium.jpg) that was very popular. The men farthest back were fullbacks and were typically the fastest men on the field. The one halfway back was (duh) the halfback and he was a big, burly man to help block.

Eventually the fullback was moved farther behind the quarterback [as seen here.](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/656014/Original_Inverted_Wishbone.jpg) The nature of the game was shifting. No longer were the fullbacks running the ball in this formation. Instead the halfback was often given the ball. With only one guy usually getting it, offenses became predictable.

This led to the [T-Formation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/T_Formation.svg/1000px-T_Formation.svg.png), with all of the backs lined up together. The fullback became the player that was blocking and the halfbacks carried the ball because they were outside of the formation. This led to faster halfbacks and bulkier fullbacks.

These days most fish and chips places will offer deep fried, fried or grilled fish. They have a wide variety of fish in various sauces and marinades. You can put together a delicious fresh fish meal with chips and salad. Almost every seaside place will have these shops, and they're in shopping centre food courts.

[Marinated fish option](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3-0gbGTTeAI/T4KXIBYLNdI/AAAAAAAAtJ8/Ym6SKwvzWG0/s1600/IMG_20120409_152756.jpg) - people who want to avoid ""fat"" will choose things like this.

[Serving salmon](http://www.urbanspoon.com/rph/70/750013/762469/sydney-a-fish-called-coogee-atlantic-salmon-photo) as an alternative to plain battered fish and chips. No reason that can't be done here.

Instead of a race to the bottom on price, it became a race to the top on quality - and it works. We did the same with pizza, and it was [a roaring success.](http://qsrmedia.com.au/editorial-opinion/commentary/crust-gourmet-group-%E2%80%93-australian-franchise-success-story)

I'm a big lover of fish and chips, having grown up with it by living near the ocean as child. Most of the places my mother took me to had catch-of-the day and a multitude of different fish to choose from. We also had lots of other things like fresh calamari rings, prawns, bearded scallops, fish cocktails, apple fritters, and pineapple fritters. I'm talking 35 years ago,. I'm not saying all fish and chip places are good, but they've been doing it right for a long time.

Quite a while ago when a lot of the pubs were gentrified, they began serving ""posh"" fish and chips.

You'd expect to pay about £10 (equivalent) for a really good fish and chips. And it is good. Beer battered, light batter, properly done chips (possibly battered as well), and usually [flathead fillets](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g552124-d756606-i48783704-Doyles_on_the_Beach-Watsons_Bay_Woollahra_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html).  Usually served with tasty salad  and home made tartare sauce. [Typical great fish and chips](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz_photos/swell-bronte?select=QuVYuiUnAJ055K0Uj5sSEQ#QuVYuiUnAJ055K0Uj5sSEQ).


I'm not sure if the UK does flathead, but it's a long slender fillet, so it doesn't fall apart under its own weight, and it provides lots of crispy batter surface.

If they wanted to see how to up their game with fish and chips, a quick visit to most inner-city-Australia pubs will show them how.

However, I do believe that with some luck, and a lot of great football, we can make the Europa league. I believe that the top 4 will sort it self out the follwing. Chelsea City Arsenal Tottenham (not in any particular order). This leaves Manchester United, Liverpool, us and perhaps a surprise packet in Southampton to battle for 5th.

Now I personally don't think that United will do well at all this season. They have shown no real evidence that they will finish highly, but it is United so you can´t really be sure.
While Southampton have made a fine start, I think they will begin to weather off towards winter and spring, just like West Brom last season.

This leaves ... Liverpool. Those red bastards are probably going to be our biggest competition this season. They have quality everywhere on the pitch, but lack squad depth. And being Liverpool, they will throw some games away that they should win, which will leave them trailing the top 4 by winter, with us right behind them.

This being said, what determines if we will finish 5th is how teams walk out of January. Suarez is still linked with Madrid, and if he goes Liverpool with be heavily crippled since Sturridge is literally their only striker besides him. The one that walks best out of that transfer window, will take 5th.

TL;DR Not strong enough for top 4, will battle with Liverpool for 5th. Transfer window will decide.

Alternatively, I really think a diamond midfield formation could work - essentially the same formation as above except one of the midfielders is deeper than the others....

e.g.


                                                      Gerrard/Lucas

                             Gerrard/Lucas                                Henderson

                                                        Coutinho

The reason I am not sure where to put Gerrard or Lucas is because both could alter the style of play slightly. If Lucas is the deep-lying midfielder he is more defensively solid than Gerrard, but less creative when he picks the ball up. If Gerrard is the deep-lying midfielder, he can play the Pirlo role but offer less defensive cover than Lucas - people have been waxing lyrical about Pirlo the past few seasons in particular and how he is getting better with age  but what people don't realise is that, although he is a quality player, he is made to seem as if he has so much time and space on the ball. This is because for both Italy and Juve he is sitting at the base of a midfield diamond. For Juve he has Pogba and Marchisio in the wide midfield positions with Vidal in the Coutinho position and for Italy he has Marchisio and Montolivo in the wide midfield positions. What this does is allow Pirlo to pick up the ball deep, in space, and when without the ball he doesn't have to do any work himself as he has his 'wide midfielders', who are essentially both defensive-type midfielders, to do all the ratting around for him. This means that when Pirlo's team wins the ball back, Pirlo is always in a prime position to recieve the ball and begin counter-attacks and creative plays.

Gerrard could fit this role perfectly, especially with Lucas and Henderson doing all the work for him. We would have such a solid spine if we played this formation. No more opposition midfielders running riot through our midfield, not to mention we would concede far fewer shots on goal. Even though what we really need is to sort out is the set-piece problem.",0,1382394906,null,0,1382448250,0,ccwnniu,t3_1oxi4r,t1_ccwnniu,t3_1oxi4r,null,1429035052,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18

Spending money on a nuclear power plant, or to increase pipe infrastructure won't effect the short term, so less people will notice it, so that party can't brag about it as effectively in their election campaign. 

With privatisation, the company can put as much money towards increasing stuff as possible, as that is their only job. They don't have to balance costs with benefits and the NHS and the countless other things the government do, rather balance between increasing service and increasing profits for investors. I believe one of the main reasons the water boards were made private, for example, was because of ageing infrastructure which the government couldn't afford to fix. 

I think the best option would be if the utility services were run by an independent government body, who were guaranteed a set amount of money each year to do with what they please (to do with that service, of course). This still has problems, but it seems to me it mixes the best of both, the non-for-profit government element, and the guaranteed income private element.

Not that Alberto doesn't have the technical skills or vision for this, but from what I've seen of him, he much prefers pushing high, and attacking goal, not that this is bad but I worry with him, Lucas, and coutinho, there won't be anyone to play the sort of balanced organizer role, ala gerrard, Allen, Alonso, schweinsteiger, etc. 

Also as you pointed out, there's a lack of strength, both him and coutinho are smaller, young guys, and while Lucas is a good defensive player, he mostly does that through positioning and tackling ability, he isn't particularly large pot strong at all.

If the area is also infrastructure, then there's something to said for going even further and running it as a loss-leader to subsidize commercial ventures that can piggy-back on top of it. And you can make your money back from the revenues that they generate.

The problem with privatisation is that though you can get a lot of upfront investment initially, eventually the creditors will want to see a return on their money.

All that said, well regulated private infrastructure can work very well. Until the 1990s the energy companies in America were obliged by law to reinvest a significant proportion of their profits back into the maintenance and expansion of their infrastructure. The result being cheap energy. The problem was they had a big incentive to lobby for deregulation so they could make more money.

So would renationalisation be an instant solution?

No, it turns out there's no monopoly on corruption or just plain mismanagement, regardless of whether a system is state or privately owned, and a corporation culture takes years to change.

If you're a CM that rarely gets involved in attacking, then you are a DM . and though he can press, he doesn't make enough defensive plays to be a good enough DM. So where does he fit?

I'm not saying i expected a goal from him, I'm saying he should have tried to get a goal. He needs to try. We need our midfielders to try and do this. ESPECIALLY when Newcastle is sitting back, we had little to lose in having ONE of our 2 holding mids go in and join the attack. Playing with 3 in the back, I think our CB's could handle a counterattack that consists solely of Remy. If he did this at Sunderland, then fine, more power to Hendo, I hope he can recover that form. Currently though, I see a player that is very timid and is not the type of player we need if we want to make top 4. He's versatile and he's got bags of technical skill. But he rarely attempts to join in the attack and he's not really a DM. Seems more like a bench option than a starter. a Very good bench option, but still..

I forget where exactly it was mentioned but there was a comment somewhere that stated both sides used time as a weapon, reversing defeats into victories and both time lords and daleks dying and being revived 100 times over to fight the same battles over and over again. Think about trying to keep track of your age during all that. At some point he likely just gave up. Afterwards he probably figured he had been travelling in the TARDIS for 900ish years which is why even though he gives the number as his age he uses the expression ""900 years of time and space"". My guess is that after losing track in the Time War he took the approximate amount of time he had been travelling for, rounded it down and began again from there.

I missed my first game of the season this weekend, so i cannot comment on what happend unfortunately.  First of all, i'm astonished they kept the 3 at the back when the game went to 11v10.  I don't even like the 3 at the back formation tbh ( eventhough i DO really like the players we have back there ).

Liverpool plays 2 deep CM.

1.  I think Hendo is better than Gerrard at defending.

2.  I think Hendo is a MUCH better passer.  Watching Gerrard pass from the deep role is sometimes brilliant, but most of the time dreadful.

3.  Lucas is back there to mop up ( overall, pretty sure he was suspended last game ) the D that gets by Gerrard/whoever else is placed there.   The other CDM can defend like Xavi, and not like Busquets, when you play 2 deep CM's.

I'm not saying I would start Hendo over Gerrard right now, i wouldn't, but nobody that is as critical of Hendo as you are ( no hate, i get pretty critical of players at times as well ) is equally as critical on Gerrard.  If I had a team and had to choose between both players right now, and not worry about Tshirt sales, i would pick Hendo hands down.

To put it simply, a deep lying playmaker like Hendo, is not very effective in an 11 v 10 game.   There is no ""deeplying"" when the other team sits in the box.  It's why Barca have a hard time when any team sits in the box.  Fortunately they quite a few players who can break that, but if you actually watch La Liga, they have struggled VERY much against that.

Just my 2 cents.  I think we can all agree that if Liverpool post the W we are all very happy, no matter who they put in =)",0,1382399860,null,0,false,0,ccwpouy,t3_1ox2eq,t1_ccwpouy,t1_ccwp4hp,null,1429034057,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

His technical ability makes him a much bigger asset than say Lennon or Townsend. Not saying he's better just saying that since teams usually sit back against us the lack of pace athleticism is irrelevant. And his goalscoring ability is an asset, especially considering Holtby/Eriksen aren't going to score many goals from the 10 position.

Seriously, every time he's on the pitch he works hard, he's a great YOUNG squad player, and (even though it doesn't count for much at this stage of the season) our 3rd highest goal scorer.
Most teams would be more than happy to have Gylfi as a squad player. He's got a good pass, he has vision, and he's probably the best we have when it comes to a dead ball situation.

There's a reason why he's been getting starts over others, so to talk about selling him is just ridiculous. 

I watched the Villa game last night after hearing people say he was terrible, and boy some of you have a distorted version of terrible. Granted he didn't have his BEST game, but he was tidy with his passing (best completion percentage of anyone with more than 20 passes) and ran his ass off.

Go back and watch the amount of times he passes the ball inside and immediately takes off behind his defender into space. Again, I'm not saying he was amazing, but he worked hard, and outplayed his opposite number (Agbonlahor)

The monopolies and cartels aren't giving value for money, a competent government could nationalize the services without making a profit, thus costing us less. Rail is always going to be a monopoly, it makes no sense for it to be private, and any improvement you recall about rail wasn't down to it being privatised. Why won't energy companies make bills easier to understand? Simplicity itself would be valued over the competition.

This is a separate argument to government investment. Investment in for instance, road, rail, ports, internet, and electricity would have long term economic gains. Without investment the services won't magically become better just because they're run not for profit by a government. The recent deal for a nuclear plant doesn't seem like a great deal for the British people, seems a lot like PFI, where government pays a lot more (even 10 times more in the case of PFI) than they would if they did it themselves.

He is a goal scoring no.10...he's not going to beat you with a dribble, he isn't likely to unlock your defense with his passing, he is not an amazing on the ball defender...he is a no.10 who can shoot and has good awareness around the box.

We put him out wide because he works hard and we have Lamela settling and Chadli hurt, people can argue that Siggy isn't a natural winger and we can't look at him as such, that he is playing an inverted forward slot where he is supposed to shoot...fair enough, but the problem has been we have been inverting a player who is a CAM/Second striker and not a winger so we have put a player who is at his strongest attacking the net in the middle of the pitch out on the wing with no additional support (Rose's injury) and asked him to give us a solid shift, for the most part he has done so.  He wouldn't be my first choice out on the left but he can do a shift from time to time.

I would really like to see AVB experiment more with Siggy in the middle of the pitch.  Think of the midfield that Swansea deployed when Siggy was there.

----Britton-----Gylfi-----
------------------------
-------Joe Allen---------

Joe Allen served as a deep lying distributor with Leon Britton and Gylfi playing more advanced....Gylfi thrived running the channel on the right side of the pitch that was opened up by Dyer and Rougledge outside of him and Danny Graham in front of him.  He was able to do what he is very capable of being...a scoring menace from the middle of the park.

Now look at what we could do with a similar lineup

-----Eriksen/Holtby-----Gylfi-----
--------------------------------
--------Paulinho/Dembele-------

It would allow Eiksen/Holtby to be the advanced playmaker and Gylfi to run the channel opened up by Townsend/Lamela/Lennon outside of him and Eriksen/Holtby to the left of him.  It would still allow us to have Paulinho on the pitch in more of a holding slot but still allow him to make his bursting runs up the pitch now and then.

Is it an ideal situation for every game?....no, but it would allow us to take advantage of our depth and versatility by putting a more attack minded central midfield on the pitch now and then (for example against a team like Sheriff) yes, and i think we need some more attacking experimentation overall.

We shouldn't be looking to sell Gylfi, he serves a purpose.  Dempsey served the same purpose last season...a player with a nose for goal that can be used in squad rotation, except Gylfi is younger than Dempsey.  If someone really wants Gylfi i can't see us saying no to a good offer, i just don't know that we would actively seek to sell him because goal scoring midfielders are tough to come by.

Who says im not critical of Gerrard :P . Actually, I don't like either of them. I mean, I LOVE both of them..but I'd rather see us go a different direction, and they are not the players that can take us there. 


I think we are destined to play more attractive football considering Rodgers is our coach and that was sort of his thing at Swansea. We have not seen attractive-possession based football once this season. And as Rodgers has stated, this is largely because we do not have the players for it. I'm at work right now, i'm sick. I can't think straight. But here is what I envision for our future. This is not just what i want, but what I foresee rodgers doing. 

1. Allen/Alberto paired with Lucas. Allen and Alberto are very different mids than Hendo and Gerrard. Both play a different style, a spanish style. Again, that sounds like a generalization, but if you've been watching football a long time, I'm pretty sure you get my point. Alberto and allen control the tempo of the game. Hendo and Gerrard play at one speed, and its too slow. Allen and Alberto are also more comfortable going forward than Hendo/Gerrard. This is important for attack and in keeping possession. 

You mention Barca, and thats a great example. In their best days, Xavi was their deep lying play maker. a HUGE reason he was so great was his ability to shake off pressure and get out of tight situations. Being able keep the ball at the midfield rather than pass back to the CB's is a very critical point in playing possession ball and keeping control of the game. Once you pass back to the CB's (like Hendo so often does) that invites the opposition to advance further into your own half, forcing the goalie or CBs to get possession. Now, with players like xavi, thats not a big deal, because they can't pick the ball up again under and pressure and play out of that pressure. But when that happens with us, we are forced to hoof the ball because none of our CMs are comfortable in possession. This is why I can't wait for Suso to come back. Though I think we'll end up using him on the RW, He would be great at CM as he is for Spain's U21s. Alberto and Allen are more confident in possession then Hendo/Gerrard. 

Fuck, my cold is getting worse. I think i'm repeating myself. Anyway, I think the future we'll be playing better ball and I don't think Hendo will be a starting CM in that future unless he pulls a Lucas and turns himself into a world class DM.

Ideologically I'd love to see the four countries become independent at once- Westminster's a bloated, self-indulgent horror that serves nobody but itself. In that event I'd keep some form of it, in name at least- though in a massively cut-down version- for defence and foreign policy as we're a tiny land mass and it makes sense to me for those to be unified. (Sorry Norn Ireland, I know that things are still all fucked up for you but I've only visited a few times and have no idea how to sort that shite out, so I'm lumping you in with us for the moment. Nae luck.)

In practice, however, I need to see the minutiæ of the White Paper that the SNP are due to publish next month: which will apparently lay out, in clear terms, how we can afford independence as a nation. I don't want to see opinion from think tanks, analysts, bloggers or zealots on reddit (/r/scotland has several of those from both sides of the debate so approach at your own risk!) I want the Yes! campaign to put their guaranteed numbers down on paper, along with their workings showing how they've come to those conclusions. They're the ones saying that that things will be better if we break away; so it's up to them to prove it, as there's no way in hell I'm going to take a chance on things getting worse just because ""Westminster's bad!"", without some bona fide guarantee that the alternative being presented will, and *not just might*, be better.

I don't think we can feasibly afford independence right now, given the state of the UK and European economies. As such, my vote's going to a ""no"" until those people in power who say that things will be better after a yes vote can actually back up their claims with numbers and no weasel words. 

Ultimately they're only politicians though, just the same as those in Westminster, so I somehow doubt that they'll be able to change my mind. It'd be nice for them to prove me wrong.
