true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","I work for a bus company. I never worked under the council/government, but plenty of people I know did. The whole ""government is inefficient"" trope held true in many cases.

If there's no profit incentive, there's no reason to be profitable.

 We currently run regular services down pretty much every arterial road into the city centre. Close to the vast majority of people.  
When it was council run, they ran buses much less regularly, down every single street in the city, because they didn't want to upset anyone, and lose votes. even if they could cut half of those services, save vast amounts of money, and barely inconvenience anyone.

There also used to be dozens of spare drivers ""just in case"", now there's many less. Partially because it's more efficient, partially because the council/government didn't want to hassle the unions. 

I heard of one city (possibly Sheffield, can't remember) where they barely raised ticket prices for 20 years. Someone worked out that it would have been cheaper to let everyone on for free, and go back to charging the drivers the ""driving only"" rate (that they earned when every bus had a conductor). The fares wereAs soon as it was privatised, the fares shot up to something approaching covering costs.

I'm not saying service has improved, as I say, I don't remember pre-privatisation, but that's the theory.

I believe the perfect solution would be Govenrnment run, but has to turn X profit.

The other argument there is, that the Government either has to have a monopoly, or it's inherently unfair against competitors.

 Sturridge on the other hand, looks a lot more like Carroll. He has pace going for him, whereas Carroll has height and strength. Sturridge never really looked like he could create his own chances. He doesn't exactly magic himself through the defense to create a goal, or makes a killer assist. He's given the ball, moves to get a good shot and scores. Or, he links up with a player (something Carroll has done before) to help create a chance. When there's a glimpse of a chance, he's a selfish shot by nature and I don't fault him that, it generates results. However in times when he was alone (first 3 games) he was stranded upfield with nothing to do. Carroll has been there before. 

If you recall the last few of Carroll's games, he WAS creating his own chances. He nearly tied up the FA cup final. He was VERY influential in the Everton game. And his final game at Leverkusen, he looked like the perfect squad player. Didn't act one bit out of place in the ""system"".

Because he might be tempted to change the chain of events -- he hates endings.

Also, while obviously a little iffy, the Doctor pointed out a few times as 9 and 10 that events in the past are progressing at the same rate as time is passing in his present.

2)  As a graphic artist myself, I would have already bought one except for, as everyone's said, the price.  Now, I KNOW that's exactly what you don't want to hear, but please read on.  As a self-employed graphic artist, I totally know that seeing someone say ""the price is a bit high..."" can instantly translate into ""I don't think your talent is worth that cost,"" but that's not always what they're saying.  
Sometimes, yes, people are just cheap (recently had a deal fall through when a guy refused to pay more than $250 for a corporate logo my partner and I designed).  Sometimes though, they're not lying: they simply can't afford to spend that kind of money for that kind of product.  
When that is the case, I'd suggest testing out different pricing. Say you do lower the cost to, say, $30, and you notice a distinct increase in sales.  The profit per item went down, but assuming you sold enough, your total profit might have actually raised.   Of course, you never lower your price below cost, but at some point after experimenting enough you'll find the point where you make the most money.  
Granted, you could have a degree in statistical modeling and what I just said sounds like child's play, but it is certainly worth exploring.

Again, I really, really enjoy your work (still looking at possibly ordering a print...) and very nearly pulled the trigger until I considered what it was I would be spending that amount of money on.  You're a very talented artist and I wish you all the luck in the world for creating a sustainable business model doing what you clearly have a passion for.

true,maybelying,null,null,"The Doctor does have a present, that being his most current point on his timeline.  Consider the timeline as being like one of those moving sidewalks you see at airports and such.  You just stand there and it moves you in a linear fashion automatically while life happens around you.

As he lives his life he is progressing in real time through his timeline, just as the conveyor carries you from one point to another.

He does have the ability to move through time and observe and interact with events, but once he does, those events are linked to that point where he is currently at in his timeline.  The golden rule for Timelords is that they are not allowed to move backwards on the timeline/conveyor to revisit past events linked to them because it can have drastic consequences.

When he does go back to old companions or others from his past, he always interacts at them in a relative point that is beyond where he last saw them.  You saw him, for instance, run into Sarah Jane in present time but you would never see him, from that point, go back and revisit a younger Sarah Jane.  The present Sarah Jane became linked to his timeline at that point where he met her again, and so to revisit Sarah Jane at a previous point on her own timeline would risk contaminating her timeline where she is linked to him in the future.

Upon learning of the Brigadier's death, that then became a fixed point on his own timeline.  It would be dangerous to go back and visit an earlier Brigadier before he died, because there is always the risk of altering the outcome that is supposed to be fixed. 

All that said, there certainly are times where the Doctor has revisited people from his past at points in their own past, but they are usually under extreme circumstances.  Another example would be Ten going back and talking to Rose before she met Nine, he really shouldn't have done that but then he was facing regeneration and probably didn't care.  It's simply not something they would normally do.

Should also point out that Timelords and other temporal travelers tend to be immune to the effects of interacting together at different points in their own timelines - such as the way the Doctor and River kept meeting each other at different points relative to each other.",0,1386394281,null,0,false,0,cdvnpde,t3_1s9umm,t1_cdvnpde,t3_1s9umm,null,1428357752,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Defence: Azpilicueta (goes down flank, pairing with Hazard), Cahill (covers for Azpilicueta when he goes forward), Terry, Ivanovic (stays back)

Midfield: Hazard, Mikel (in a holding position), Lampard, Mata. Let's give  Ramires a break - he's been working his socks off, but keep him on the bench just in case. Maybe Mata could do better by himself with Ivanonic to cover him, and maybe work some magic by himself away from Hazard, who has his own brand of superpower. 

Forwards: Eto'o up front, Torres behind him. Now this might be a little controversial, but with his current workrate, Torres might do better providing for Eto'o, who can just focusing on poaching goals.

This is based solely on their current skills though, and doesn't take into much account what the players themselves want to do. A little change up, maybe?

Bench: Schwarzer, Cole, Ramires, Luiz, Schurrle, Willian, Ba.

I find it interesting that statements like this get hedged around so much. For a time the ANC was flat-out a terrorist organization, by any sensible use of the word. And he was head of it. But we don't like to say so, partly because they won their case (which might serve as an example of terrorism *working*, and we can't have that) and partly because they deployed terrorism against a regime that most of the rest of the world considered abhorrent (and the enemy of my enemy can't be a terrorist now, can they?). See also, former IRA leaders now in government in Northern Ireland.

My impression is that to admit that the ANC were terrorists and that they were ultimately on the right side of history and they won would derail attempts to use the word “terrorist” to dismiss our current enemies as incomprehensible evil-doers doomed to failure.

But again, I don't want to get too hung up on this.  The 50th was an episode designed to appeal to the viewers.  Tom Baker was given a cameo as a shout-out to the fans, I'm not going to read too much into his appearance in terms of canon.

It's similar to the moment's conscience appearing as ""Bad Wolf"".  Moffat has said that they were happy to get Billie Piper for the episode and wanted to try and stretch her range for the show, but they would have worked in someone different if they had to.  There are a lot of theories now floating about Bad Wolf being the moment et al., but they are just a result of the producer simply being able to get the right actor for the job, not a result of the story demanding the right actor.

Billie Piper and Tom Baker were brought back because that is what the fans wanted to see, but I won't take their presence as canon because I don't believe it was intended to be that way, it opens up too many cans of worms otherwise.  

It is interesting to debate the plot points their presence creates, but at the end of the day, I suspect it will all amount to timey-wimey and never really be addressed again.",0,1386406082,null,0,false,0,cdvqnba,t3_1sapqv,t1_cdvqnba,t1_cdvo5un,null,1428356307,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

You would see people going about gasping for breath, and telling each other that the likes of them could not expect to have air to breathe unless they had the money to pay for it. Most of you here, for instance, would think so and say so, even as you think that it's right for a few people to own the Earth, the Minerals and the Water, which are all just as necessary as is the air.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; There are just too many vagueries and too few concrete guarantees being offered by Yes Scotland to get my vote. I'd hoped that the White Paper would change my mind but it felt to me like most salient points come down to ""we'd have to negotiate"" which, whilst somewhat understandable, just isn't good enough for me- I wanted numbers and it was just a party manifesto.

I don't think it's really possible for the Scottish Government to give you an exact timetable for issues that clearly involve other countries. Scotland can not unilaterally decide how long it would take to remove Trident, clarify EU membership, or identify Scotland's share of the UK's assets/debts.

Similarly, you will not see any absolute guarantees from the no campaign - nobody can predict where the UK will be in 10 years (Out of the EU? Still pursuing austerity? Scrapping devolution?).


&gt; Sturgeon's said that, in the event of us staying together, the SNP will push for another referendum within 15 years and I'm okay with that if it doesn't lead to a ""Neverendum"" situation.

I think she described the referendum as a ""once in a generation"" event, and when asked how long ""a generation"" was, picked 15 years.

That seems a little short, but then again there was an 18 year gap between the devolution referendums and a 17 year gap between the devolution and independence referendums. Politically, 1997 does feel like a generation - Tony Blair had just defeated John Major.

Well the ways to get contraception are incredibly varied and easy here. If you're a student, you can pretty much get as many condoms as you like completely free (whether you're male or female) from a college nurse or SU or welfare officer or whatever.

I don't think condoms and contraceptive pills are freely available to the non-student public. That would probably cost too much (as students, we indirectly pay for all the contraceptives through SU levies and fees). BUT:

If you are a girl (I know this from a past relationship), you can get emergency (post sex) contraception (the ""morning after"" pill) *absolutely free* from *any pharmacy* just by going in and asking.

They don't take down your details or anything, just have a quick chat to make sure you haven't been sexually assaulted and that you know about the possibly side effects of the pill etc. Then it's just a single pill taken with a cup of water.

First you select an industry and develop a sector using public funds (taxes) so that everyone in the country basically pays for and benefits from the service.  

Although in inefficient at making a profit compared to the private sector this is OK as its an asset owned by everybody and should not be run for profit.  Its there basically to provide that service to the whole country. 

Then, after everybody has paid into the scheme through their taxes and a huge infrastructure has been built around the service (think water, power, trains, ect) so that there is effectively no competition, the government sells the service at a profit and keeps the extra tax to spend on other stuff (like the high speed rail link or Trident ect - the cash for these projects has to come from somewhere after all)  

If you are luck enough to know a few high level bankers and investors who can get round the regulations, you can buy huge amounts shares in the new privitised company at a low initial price and them sell them a few days later a vast profit.  If your an individual you might get the chance to buy a few shares if you have some spare cash and make a bit of a profit but you are never going to make anything like 30 or 40 years of investment through your tax back.

As an individual who might be party to privitisation information, you could make huge profits making deals to say service Royal Mail vans via a new business you have just set up or supplying educational equipment to school academies at county level.

The government can now whip its hands of any responsibility for a the service as its nothing to do with them whilst the new company makes its self a profit by inflating prices and cutting the cost of running the service.

As far as I know, there has never been a successful privitisation of a nationalised company, at least in terms of the consumer.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The comments section of every one of these posts have the same 4 people either defending them in some roundabout way, saying ""...but what about x that makes republicans look bad"" or complaining about the NATS that control this subreddit.  These 4 will take it in turns to get outraged and submit a BBC article that only went up on the BBC news website 5 minutes ago with an editorialised headline ""Why has nobody submitted...republicans...disgrace...outrage..."".  The comments section of these posts will then have a few familiar names defending the republicans in a roundabout way, saying ""what about x that makes loyalists look bad"" etc etc. and the cycle continues.  We can't just have a laugh at a topic or a serious discussion like any other normal functioning subreddit.  We always have to push our own personal political agendas and make the other side look bad.

You need to be able to tell the difference between a journalist attempting to identify and point out the *reasons* (not the same as *justification*) that a terrorist attack has happened and a moron trying to actually support, justify or encourage an act of terrorism.

We must not be afraid of confronting the *true reasons* behind a terrorist committing an attack.

Terrorist attacks aren't random events by random people who suddenly got up one day and decided to blow themselves up in a public place. There is a real reason a person feels such strong hatred for a country and its people that they would conduct a barbaric, indiscriminate attack on innocent victims.

**It doesn't excuse or justify their actions in any sense.** No amount of personal pain and anguish can justify attacking innocent people. But if you want to be able to identify potential terrorists and stop them before they cause death and destruction, you need to understand where they come from and how they come to be like that.

Know your enemy, understand their reasons for becoming your enemy, and maybe, just maybe, you can work to stop them from ever becoming your enemy in the first place.

That is what those articles attempt to do. Identify the problem - this might be for example, western intervention in the middle east or western bombings of innocent middle easterners or religious intolerance and racism in the UK. If we acknowledge these problems, then maybe we can change our methods and culture to remove these issues, and remove the reason for terrorism altogether.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"Not exactly. Essentially, Scotland raises tax revenue which then goes into the central pot. This central pot is then divied up, through the Barnett formula.

The Barnett formula isn't really the best way to divy up, but we still haven't figured out exactly a fairer way to do it. (E.g. low density areas like Wales *need* higher funding per capita just to maintain their roads than other places).

As is, Scotland 'wins' with the Barnett formula lottery. It's not a lot, in all honesty, but yes Scotland does get more than most seem is justified. This might be reviewed at some point in the future. Then again, FPTP isn't fair either, but we've managed to haul that around for 300 years or so.

So, currently because of the way taxes are raised 'generally' by everyone, and then distributed according to the formula, Scotland gets a net gain from the rest of the UK of £7bn a year. If they went independent, this would vanish, resulting in a £7bn shortfall in their finances, but would be offset by the gain of £4bn in oil revenues.

If they remain part of the UK, they will get £7bn a year, but it might be revised down to a net transfer of £3bn a year. I don't think this is cast in stone either way though.

Having said all this, Scotland's annual GDP is £216bn. +/- 3 or 4 bn either way shouldn't be a huge deal - the big issue is whether Scottish people want to remain as part of the Union.",0,1386419320,null,0,false,0,cdvsdsa,t3_1saa8m,t1_cdvsdsa,t1_cdviuqt,null,1428355497,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Well first off, that isn't the referendum question. It is: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?""

Secondly, recent attempts at reform - regional assemblies, AV rather than FPTP - have failed miserably. Westminster would have absolutely no reason to acquiesce to demands for reform when it seems the vast majority of the electorate simply don't want it.

The reason I'll be voting Yes in the referendum next year is because I believe it's the *only* way I'll see significant political reform. I've noticed, with greater frequency, people from the rest of the UK (England in particular) trying to portray Scottish independence as being inherently selfish.

Ask yourself, if there were constant death threats and even a beating that happened, why did the police do nothing when they have the powers to do so? Harassment, death threats and assault are all crimes. And the police already acted on a report from the informant.

Though this is a fictionalised version of my interpretation of events, here's what I think happened:

Boy A witnesses drug deal and gets threatened. Goes home, tells parents, parent reacts by calling police. 

After much cyberbullying and semi-serious but illegal threats, boy A enters depression and wants to kill self. Parents are obviously much more protective than usual at this stage.

Boy A kills self.

This story really hits home with me and I feel fortunate that my circumstances weren't quite as extreme as this. On two occasions, I have had accusations falsely made about me.

The first was a girl who I had a crush on. I asked her out but was rejected, no big deal. Until I hear a few months later that she had gone around telling people that I tried to rape her. I was threatened on msn messenger (thankfully Facebook wasn't around) by her friends and this went on for months and then resurfaced over a year later when I started going out with a girl from her school, who she 'warned' about me. There was even a time when she was asked what the scratches were on the back of her legs and her response was that I had dragged her into the woods and tried to rape her. I don't think she ever thought about the consequences of what she was saying and she only shut up about it when I threatened to get the police involved. Despite this being over 8 years ago, it still concerns me and I worry that there are still people out there who think I raped a 15 year old girl, who I never even got as far as holding hands with.

My second story involved a school trip to Disneyland Paris, where I walked in on two classmates fondling a female classmate who was absolutely hammered. I pulled them off of her and took her back to her room, explaining the situation to the girl she was sharing with. Her response the next day? Tell everyone I had said if she didn't sleep with me then I would tell the teachers she was drunk. Thanks a lot. The thing is though, I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would rather stop it from happening and risk silly accusations than leave her to potentially get raped.

I can imagine if either of these happened nowadays, the spread through social media would have made my life a lot more difficult and I may have ended up taking drastic action like Tom.

I've been trying to think of a cannabic campaign recently, do you think these points cover it?

Can rarely cause anxiety, will make you hungry, sleepy, appreciative of art, may cause you to develop a ritual or habit around it if you like to have it more than 4 times a week, makes food taste great and music sound amazing, can sometimes last after sleep and cause drowsiness. Lowers inhibition and every use raises tolerance. Will cause you to awkwardly meet with drug dealers. Overuse is not as bad as alcohol but causes clouded memory and focus. Some strains will lead to more energic feeling. Easy to quit. Eating it will cause longer and much more high dose into system. Extremely high doses can result in paranoia and PTSD as well as elation, euphoria and introspection.

I won't share all my reasons for choosing the price I did, but let me say that for one thing, I *never* expected a response as huge as this and I definitely can't afford to buy in as large of bulk as some were suggesting. I'm still very new at all this. (And this is somewhat beside the point, but do remember that independent artists have to pay 25% of their profit as tax. I definitely didn't realize that before I started selling art.)

However...I have decided to lower the price for Reddit users. If you do want to purchase a calendar, use the coupon code **REDDIT** for $10 off your order. (If you want to order more than one, please contact me, and I will set up a custom listing that has a larger discount.) Please only use this code if you're ordering a calendar.

*If you already purchased one from me, get in contact with me ASAP and I'll refund you the value of the discount, because otherwise that wouldn't be very fair!*

I also feel like I should add the disclaimer that I can't make any concrete guarantees about the calendars arriving in time for Christmas. If you order now, and you live in the continental US, they *should* arrive in time - but I don't want to make any promises I can't keep. I'm a one-woman operation and now I've got to prepare to get extremely busy! :)

If this post doesn't get enough visibility, I might make a new post. So, if you see this, upvote for visibility, please!

Lastly, I'd like to thank this community for your support - this is the first place I ever shared my art in the first place, and you really inspired me to keep going. Thanks!",0,1386426307,null,0,false,1,cdvtk37,t3_1s9es0,t1_cdvtk37,t3_1s9es0,null,1428354949,53,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,53

What happens is, a Shell tanker pulls up at the refinery, loads the fuel, then ""additives"" are mixed in (something for increased engine life, or whatever), then the tanker drives off. Then another one pulls up, but maybe this time it's for Tesco. So it loads in, mixes in the Tesco additives, and so on and so on.

For example, almost all fuel sold in Scotland (whatever its branded as) came through the BP Grangemouth refinery, and there are only 6 others in the UK.

Same fuel, different additives. Not necessarily better, just different.

But here's the kicker. Nearly every fuel company in the UK is part of a net fuel agreement, which redistributes fuel around the country to head off any local fuel shortages.

I can't remember how far in advance the tickets are available but I bought mine in June or July for an October match.


Edit: Also, I stayed in the Everton Hostel (has nothing to do with Everton FC) which is slightly out of the city center but not too far. I walked everywhere and was fine. The hostel is roughly halfway between the city center and Anfield, so it was a good place to be. Mainly, though, I stayed there because it was about 10-15 pounds cheaper per night than the other hostels. I met some pretty cool people of all ages there, some LFC fans, some not, and it made my 2 weeks in Liverpool a pretty awesome experience.

Also, take the tour of Anfield. Its awesome. Got to touch the sign as they walk out and got a picture of me holding the 2005 CL cup.

One of the biggest benefits I see for legalisation is taking the supply out of the hands of criminals. Also the worst thing that can happen to you through the use of cannabis is not a health risk but the law. Lives have been ruined through the criminalization of cannabis users, not the effects of cannabis itself. Sure, I know people who smoke too much and have lost their enthusiasm for a lot of things but they are still free and many people I know have turned their life around, limited their consumption and improved their quality of life.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"I'd avoid using words like 'result in' or 'cause' because it's not clear. So far it seems like it doesn't occur directly because of cannabis, more that in those individuals *already predisposed* to anxiety, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders, that cannabis use can exacerbate these manifestations. Hence people susceptible to these would be well advised to stay away from it.

I think, like with most drugs, use and effects can be subjective. So tacking things on like ""appreciative of art"" sounds a bit wishy washy to me, and too preachy. I'm a very science-y kinda person though I always prefer when these sorts of things stick to the facts, especially when you add comments about experiences so many people like to interpret it as nothing but stoner nonsense, ultimately diluting the message.

true,Guido_Montag,null,null,"In general the idea is that private companies are more efficient due to the due profit motive.  For example: Tesco and Sainsbury are both going to be very efficient in an effort to compete for customers.  Whichever offers the better service to the consumer will make more money, open more stores, make more money.  Consumers, have, largely a free choice between Tesco &amp; Sainsbury.

Where this fails in privatisation is that consumers have, largely, no real choice.  Were I to take the train from the North East to London I have no choice in operators.  I have no choice in water company.

In terms of companies where switching is relatively easy and straightforward.  Well, with energy, and to a lesser extent telecomms, we had a big bang after privatisation with many options, but now we really only have a choice between a few operators.  What you will notice is that they have learned to make their tariffs as opaque as possible.  If A is cheaper than B everyone will move to A.  But if A offers a rate of £X/kWhr + £Y/kWhr over Zhrs + a fee of £P, capped at not more than £Q/kWhr.  But for each company X,Y,Z,P &amp; Q are different.  It becomes very hard to compare like with like.  Not to mention they often act as cartels, pushing up prices &amp; blocking entry to smaller players. 

Finally you have the most corrupt of all those that rely directly on HM Govt. for their income.  Privatised hospitals/prisons/work placements and, as it happens, bus &amp; train companies almost fit into this as they get so much money in the form of free bus passes and state subsidies.  But going back to prisons/work placements - these are often ""payment on results"".  Given that the government doesn't believe that civil servants are capable of running these organisations, it seems quite happy for them to set the targets for the companies to hit.  What is worse, &amp; occasionally happens, is they will bring in a consultant or group of consultants to work with the outsourcing company to set the targets.

tl;dr: Privatising is supposed to improve efficiency by introducing the profit motive, it doesn't always work. ",0,1386431041,null,0,false,0,cdvur9y,t3_1s9xgp,t1_cdvur9y,t3_1s9xgp,null,1428354391,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

From a wider perspective, Facebook is a relentless nightmare for pastoral staff in schools. It provides a platform for group bullying in a way we have never seen before. If it isn't Facebook it's BBM and Twitter, which also empower the bully to attack 24/7 in a public forum. At the same time, the victim has no real ability to reply, as standing up for yourself usually causes a tidal wave of responses from 'passive bullies' making the situation far worse. When a student becomes the victim of cyber bullying in my school the first thing I do is advise them to close all their accounts for the mental well being.

Flannagan put in another good performance too. Looked more confident today as well. 

I've been critical of Johnson lately but he had a good game. Played a significant part of the third goal with a great first touch and cross to Suarez.

Skrtel and Sakho I felt confident with, but really didn't see enough of them to really tell. Gotta say both gave their all when things heated up early in the second half, and both seem like our most physical defenders. Skrtel has got to stop scoring on us though!

true,Dogba11,present,,"Not a disgrace. Chelsea vs Barcelona in 2009 was a disgrace. This was a bad result with some bad mistakes from our players and a ref that made some mistakes.

 My thoughts:

Walters clearly fouled Azpilicueta in the build up for the second goal, yet the ref let it pass. Cost us a goal. Later Walters tries to get in a fight with Terry, who's having none of it. Walters pushes Terry with two hands multiple times and the ref only produced a yellow. Seemed like the ref was losing grip of the game.

Schürrle was excellent, scoring two brilliant goals and also working his socks off pressing and chasing the ball. Mata was ok, seemed to be tracking back more, but wasn't too incisive in attack. Played some good passes though. Hazard was excellent in dribbling with the ball, but sloppy with the final ball. And he didn't get into as many dangerous positions as I would have liked him to. In the middle of the game I thought Torres looked quiet, but tbh he was better than either Ba or Eto'o. Speaking of which, Eto'o looked way off the pace. Lost the ball many times when we were attacking in dangerous positions. 

At the back, JT looked more or less comfortable. Cahill made a few errors in playing out the back. Azpilicueta looked distinctly uncomfortable, and I think some of that was because of playing on the left. Ivanovic was ok. Cech was at fault for the first goal, couldn't do anything about the other two. 

All in all, a performance to forget. We have Palace at home next in the league so we should try to build some momentum from there. I'm confident that Jose will get the team firing again for Steaua.

However, what I would say is that even if it was good quality, you're dealing with a mixture of people.  X% won't feel like eating regardless of what is offered, they are sick, I often do not feel like eating when I am sick.  Y% only want turkey twizzlers &amp; white toast; if you don't offer that their family will pitch up with a big mac for them.  Z% are used to Michelin starred food &amp; won't eat whatever you serve either - their family will bring in Pret sandwiches.  If the hospital aims for somewhere between the turkey twizzlers &amp; Pret sandwiches.  You need X+Y+Z to be as low as possible, but maybe 40% (or 25% is the figure I found with google) is that figure.  Without some comparisons as outlined above, it is largely meaningless.

true,The_NigerianPrince,NG,nigeria,"Such a painful loss to take. I personally think we played quite well, but there are couple a things hurting us badly. One is ineffective and completely absent strikers. Its not just the strikers fault but we've somehow gotten used to a drogba hat we don't know how to play with normal strikers any longer. We end up isolating the striker for almost throughout the game. It doesn't help that we don't have any top quality striker at the moment which all title contenders typically have. This results in midfielders s working much harder than they should have to which tires them a lot. I know its not a popular opinion, but I feel Demba Ba is actually the best striker for the way we play at the moment.
Then, there's Ivanovic...... Good defender but such a huge weakpoint in attack, which is  clearly evident by the open space  opposing teams give him all the time. I'd rather see Azpi who is more than capable as a right back and also able to provide something up front. Also, I don't know if I'm the only one wondering why David Luiz and Cole are not playing.... Luiz in midfield for me, cos I still think that Cahill, Terry are our most solid and reliable  center back pairing.

true,Zybob,lfc99,,"Well we are lacking especially in the midlane. Henderson, Gerrard, Lucas and Sterling are all doing fine, but they don't have that big of an impact on the games as some of them used to. Not to say that they don't have an impact at all, but they are not players who will pull through when we really need it like last weekend versus Hull. Coutinho performs quite well most of the time, but he scores way to little for a player playing his position. If you look at top teams their nr. 10 always throws in a couple of goals a season, and Cooutinho hasn't done that yet (he was injured though, so maybe it'll come soon).

The defence has troubles sometimes, especially on set pieces. Mignolet is looking amazing on the goal, but his footwork needs to be seriously improved. If he decides to just pass it to an opponent or a pressured defender like he does ocassionally then that could cost some points we really need. 

And What if Suarez gets injured or banned again? Sturridge has been perfoming well alone, but he is no Suarez and I doubt he will be able to carry us as hard as Suarez has done recently. 

I think the team is looking great overall, but they are definitely not perfect. We need a left-back, defensive and offensive midfielder to be title contenders. Maybe I'm just skeptical, but I'm fairly sure the title is out of reach, I hope I will be proven wrong.

true,sdf234234234223423,null,null,"mtgox like every other exchange works with bank transfers so you'll still need your online banking. If you want to get the best prices there's really no alternative to SWIFT or SEPA bank transfers - most UK banks allow you to do these from online banking. I would recommend Bitstamp.net or Kraken.com over mtgox though. You could probably do a SWIFT/SEPA transfer in person from a branch but actually the fees for these kinds of transfer would probably be around £10-£20 anyway so not worth it for buying £30 of BTC.

If you really don't want to use bank transfers there are some options.. some sellers on localbitcoins.com will meet you in person and accept cash - obviously it's not really worth anyone's time for £30-£40, but someone might do it just for fun.

There's www.virwox.com which allows you to buy BTC using a credit card or paypal by first buying SLL (second life lindens) and then exchanging those for BTC - you don't need to actually play the game and can do both exchanges on that website. The fees aren't great, but if you just want £30-£40 it's not going to be a huge loss in absolute terms. There's also https://www.btcquick.com/beta/ which allows directly buying with a credit card (again with high fees) - although I've not tried it. 

Another method is www.payeer.com which allows you to deposit to www.btc-e.com or https://crypto-trade.com/fees using your credit card by way of liqpay.com.. basically create a payeer.com account and then add credit from your visa/mastercard and then log into btc-e and select the top-up using payeer option.. again the fees are not great but it works.",0,1386438698,null,0,1386438898,0,cdvxf5f,t3_1s2jzf,t1_cdvxf5f,t1_cdvre23,null,1428353125,1,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,1

You make a good point (and I posted these examples in hope it would come up). 

&gt;What business is it of the government to be making cars?

Or steel or coal or ships or fixing the price of televisions (no really)? However at one time these things were thought in keeping with the common good. Deciding what benefits from pressures of private commerce and what should be run publicly is worth while discussion. 

Your point about monopoly is a good one and is essentially the reason why the successful privatisations passed the previous poster by, they were noiseless.
However perhaps we should think about why the companies you have in mind were sold.
Large infrastructure investment is difficult for modern democracies when election cycles are shorter than the ROI cycle of projects. Private capital could be said to be able to take a longer view than public bodies. This seems odd given the short term pressures in business, but the public wants and needs stuff they won't pay for in taxes.

There is no doubt in my mind that pendulum swung too far towards private capital in the last bit of the last century, but transport, water, housing and energy (did I miss any?) need huge lumps of cash from somewhere and nobody will vote for the tax increases to pay for it.

- 9 goals in 2 games!
- 2nd place! 
- 83' goal should go to Suarez. o'Brien touched it, but it wasn't his fault it went in. 
- Skrtel. 3 OGs in 3 games. He played well today and at Hull, but this must be noted. Might be a record.
- Sakho started. Sakho scored. Sakho played great defense. I cheered louder for his sliding interception than I did for any of the goals.
- Seems that we either score in the first 3 minutes, or we concede possession in our half for the first 15. We need more consistency from kickoff. 
- Panicked when Hendo went down with Gerrard already out. I know we lack midfield depth, but to lose two starters? Terrifying.
- What did Gerrard whisper to the trainer as he went off?
- Finally a non-controversial red card. Not hugely vicious, but very irresponsible. 
- Credit to Michael Oliver. We hate on refs on bad days, but never pay respect on good days.   
- 3 OGs is a bizarre game. If this was a 2-0 game, we would be disappointed. 
- I really, really, REALLY thought Luis wold have a second hattrick. I saw it on his face too.  

I think overall we should have played much better against such a weak team, but I can't complain with the results. The same problems that have been mentioned all year were evident today (lack of depth, weak midfield, odd defense situation), but the final score makes it easy to forget about that. Our most important game coming up is not Spurs, City, or Chelsea, but the transfer window.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"That's exactly the point. One (of many) reason many of these terrorists attack us is because they believe we did something to them. They despise us because of our foreign policy, because of our wars in their countries, because of our propping up of dictators who rule them to our advantage.

This, combined to their low level of education, poverty, daily pain and suffering leads them to be willing to give their lives away just to hurt us back.

Perhaps, this is not the reason that we are chosen to be attacked by these madmen. Perhaps, they're just mad, completely bat-shit insane. And just want to hurt anyone. But then, why target us? Why come all the way to the UK to do it?

Most terrorists target their own countries and people, or at most their neighbours. If they have a beef with foreigners, they target foreigners in their country. It's much more direct, and much easier to do. It takes a lot of resources and therefore a lot more hatred to send that terrorist all the way over to the UK to do it.

There must be a reason for that extra hate and that extra effort. And it most likely has something to do with something we (or our allies) did. It might not be something we did *wrong*. Of course, there are many madmen out there who hate us for doing something ""good"", like deposing a tyrant or destroying a drug cartel.

I'm not suggesting that we should change all our foreign policy so that we never, ever, piss anyone off. But we do need to trace the hatred back, even if the ultimate source ends up being ourselves, just so that we can understand and better fight and/or prevent terrorist attacks.

As an aside note, if you're talking specifically about the guardian always hounding the government about their foreign policy being a reason for increased terrorism, you should understand that the guardian is only one side of the story. They're biased. They're supposed to be biased. Their reason to exist is to attack the government from the left, just as the reason for the telegraph to exist is to attack from the right.

With that in mind, it's no wonder that they focus specifically on what *the government* did to, not cause, but perhaps add fuel to the fire of terrorism. It's only one of the reasons why terrorists attack us, certainly not the only one, and maybe even not the biggest one. Changing foreign policy isn't going to completely stop terrorism, but it could very well help.

The guardian has chosen to fight that particular battle, and it is up to other newspapers and other people to fight the other causes of terrorism, whatever they may be.",0,1386440927,null,0,false,0,cdvy9te,t3_1sazln,t1_cdvy9te,t1_cdvsv2d,null,1428352728,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,grollcool,null,null,"Why is it week after week we think Torres is doing well because he is looking ""hungry"". Why does this phrase equate to him doing well? He hasn't scored, he hasn't looked like scoring and his loanee counter part is embarrassing him by scoring week after week. Do you think that Everton fans are describing Lukaku as a ""hungry"" striker? No. They are describing him as a striker who is getting the business done for his team consistently. That is who we need. Not this ""hungry"" striker who is on and off and we keep on overhyping once he scores a couple goals. FFS Torres is not coming back, he is just an OK striker who has his nice little spells but then dissappeares in mediocrity. 

This isn't what we need at a club with the aspirations of a club like Chelsea. Do you think Manchester City, Man United, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich would want a Torres? The answer is no. He isn't a world class striker anymore, and that is what we need in order to compete. Our competitors have fucking Suarez, Negredo, Aguero, RVP, Rooney, Jovetic, Lewandowski, Cavani, Ibrahimovic, Tevez and others. We need someone who can really fill the gap Drogba left, I think Lukaku would be great but I also think that we should have another striker who is NOT young but in his prime that can alternate/pair up with him. After this season I hope that we have a complete striker overhaul and get rid of our 3 strikers that we currently have and bring back Lukaku and one more striker. Lukaku, (another Striker) and Schurrle as a backup 3rd striker is what we should have. Because in a one striker system the 3rd striker is almost useless and doesn't really play, thats why we should use someone who can play as a striker but mainly plays another position so that they have game time.

**Edit:** I also think we need to get a central midfielder, someone who can get stuck in but has a eye for a pass as well. Gundogan or Pogba would be amazing but I think both are highly unlikely to join us. More realistically I think we have a good shot at Witsel who could also be an amazing signing for us. And as much as I like Khedira, he isn't exactly what we need, if anything he would just be a better Mikel for us. We need someone is the center of the park who can spew passes around the field and control the temp and dictate the play. ( Like Schweinstieger for Bayern, Modric/Alonso for Madrid, Xavi/Busquets for Barcelona, Gundoggan/Sahin for Dortmund, Pirlo/Marchisio for Juve, Verratti for PSG, and others aswell.)

So basically we should target a center mid, a striker (only if we get rid of one of our current ones) and maybe a young CB like Mangala that we could loan back to the current club in case Terry decides to hang up his boots or Chelsea doesn't hand him a new contract.",0,1386441225,null,0,1386442001,0,cdvydvr,t3_1sbqm8,t1_cdvydvr,t3_1sbqm8,null,1428352675,53,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,53

I don't deny for a second that all citizens of Northern Ireland should be represented by its flag. However, my issue is with you coming on here and asking for a non-sectarian discussion, and then (a) suggesting a blatant symbol of Nationalist oppression as being a ""neutral"" symbol, and (b) making your own views on the matter very obvious by repeatedly suggesting that any flag can't be ""too Republican"". I honestly thought you were trolling when I first read your post.

That the flag should represent all is undeniably a valid point, but in the context of your comments it's obvious that your reasons for thinking so are motivated more by your personal Unionist sympathies rather than any kind of consideration of the bigger picture.

In short, I simply feel that it's a bit rich of you to suggest having a non-sectarian discussion when your own opinions are so close to bubbling over.

true,quistodes,eng-devon,Exeter,"This is a classic case of a Realist foreign policy as opposed to a Liberal one. Rather than being motivated by international norms of behaviour, Thatcher acted as the figurehead of a group of states that would rather pursue their own self interest and continue to trade with SA.

It is true that in most cases, sanctions do not achieve the grand aims they intend to, such as regime change. 

&gt;that sanctions do not work, indeed are likely to be 
counter-productive and damaging to those they are intended to 
help:

There is also the potential that, by damaging SA's economy, the international community risked harming the poorer black South African's they intended to help.

Similarly, Thatcher stands by the principle of non-intervention, 
&gt;""Obviously you cannot and will not allow outsiders 
to dictate the pace and the scope of change within South 
Africa."" 

The right of the international community to intervene in the affairs of states has only become widely accepted since the end of the Cold War. 

Thatcher's aim here is to promote a dialogue to ensure a peaceful and stable transition.

&gt;I want to 
be able to go on helping you end the violence and bring about 
peaceful and fundamental change.

 She argues that the release of Nelson Mandela would not only be a suitable gesture of good will and intent to negotiate, but it's also implied that Mandela would be the best representative of the ANC with which to negotiate.

As for whether Thatcher was right to pursue this policy, I'm not going to weigh in on that. I have simply done a brief analysis of this letter. It's probably not even a particularly good one. Either way, I don't know why this is being brought up. Let's focus on the great aspects of Mandela and what he stood for, rather than using his death to score points against another deceased statesperson.

From your comments and this post in general I had thought perhaps you were trolling but seems that in actual fact you are dismissing almost half of the country's population while trying to appear non-sectarian. I and a lot of people don't agree or support the notion of monarchy or identify as British. But we are in the UK, and a lot of us want to keep it that way for one reason or another.   

So why can't we just be ourselves and hold on to our identity just as the other countries in the UK have? We're different that's a fact and there's no easy solutions to be had.

Flags are powerful symbols they can inspire feelings of fear or safety  as well as pride and ire. So any flag of ours shouldn't try to be actively neutral it should just simply be representative.

When the vibe we get is hostile, like yours, it's little wonder why tension will exist.

If, in comparing the extra money Scotland receives over and above its tax revenue through the Barnett formula, with the potential oil revenue, you come to a deficit, Scotland's deficit would increase relative to the current deficit, if you come to a surplus, it would decrease.

The extra payment which would be lost is worth £7bn a year. If you believe the OBR, the oil revenue in 2015-16 will be £3.3-4.0bn, if you believe the average on that chart, it will be about £4.7bn (17% higher than the OBR), if you believe the highest, it will be £5.4bn (31% higher than the OBR).

They discriminated against unionists in all walks of life. The police force was 100% alien and would beat innocent Unionists for fun on the Shankill road without recourse.   
After hundreds of years of this behavior the Unionists want fair democracy with the aliens. The aliens are having none of it. ""This is ""Planet ZOG territory"" they say, loyal to queen ""Three eyes"" (the queen of zog). The unionists plan peaceful marches but the aliens beat them up and kill them. So the unionists give up and finally fight the aliens until they concede to a mini-democracy however the aliens do not want to cede the country from Planet Zog and continue to rub the noses of unionists into their Zog culture, they want Zog flags flying on all official buildings to remind the Unionists who owns the shankill road. The financial budgets and laws are still made in planet Zog.

**Dembele** was solid paired with **Paulinho**, and Sando looked good in the center after on. Hope Dembele's hip isn't too bad, he limped off so all I can do is speculate.

**Defoe** had some great chances today, the team put him in so many times, even after putting one off of the post, I'm a bit disappointed in him if I'm honest.

You seem to forget that there have been two splits away from the PIRA since the Libyan arms shipments in the early 80s. Firstly in 1986 when the CIRA was formed, and secondly in 1998 the RIRA was formed. These organisations were largely comprised of former PIRA members, some of who would have know the locations of PIRA arms dumps, and who would have taken weapons from these dumps.

The recent seizures of imported arms from Libya are much, much more likely to have been arms held by various dissident groups, which are obtained during internal IRA splits. The IICD are satisfied that the PIRA have decommissioned, and that should be good enough for people. Yes, there are still Republican arms dumps out there, but people should appreciate that although the PIRA did import all of these weapons, they did not remain in control of all of them.

Any argument asserting that the discovery of weapons from the Libyan shipments means that the PIRA didn't properly decommission has a serious logical flaw to it for these reasons.

It's important to plan for your future, and a pension is a huge part of that. However if you're likely to only be able to claim the pension for a decade or so before you kick the bucket, odds are it's a better investment to just stick your contributions into a savings account or ISA. Especially if you're not in a defined benefit scheme, or your pension money is invested (hint, it probably is).

This would reduce the money going into schemes and that would in turn kill the pay-out for the last generation for whom pensions were a must.

2. A box to box midfielder, I don't know who but someone like Vidal (Doubt he would ever leave Juve), so we could make the most of 433, not Pogba like others have suggested as I just don't see how he is needed. 

3. Let De Bruyne go out on loan or leave, its not fair on him and I think he's great but would rather we didn't ruin his career. 

Quick side edit: Those suggesting young prospects... I don't think that is a good idea right now, The squad needs more players who will deliver HERE AND NOW not in 4 years time after spending 3 on loan. IF we buy more prospects it should be in the summer where they can have the next few years properly planned out like we did with courtois.

What happened from the perspective of the Timelords is this; The timewar was coming close to completely annihilating Galifray so the high council decide to break the timelock that the timelords put in place many many thousands of years previously. they use the master and come back to earth where Tennant is. He has to send them back as they would destroy the earth if they came through. So he has to send them back to their deaths.The master knocks them back. While this is happening the fall of Arcadia is taking place and the younger Hurt doctor is going to destroy Galifray and the Daleks with a galaxy eater called the moment. he steals it and goes to activate it when the events of Day of the Doctor happens. when Galifray is saved and all is said and done Hurt leaves and regenerates into Eccleston and forgets completely about the events that had just happened. All he remembers is he stolen the moment and was about to use it. He probably goes and checks Galifray and finds its gone so he assumes he destroyed it. he lives his life and becomes Tennant. He then participates in Day of the Doctor and when he leaves he forgets about it too.The only thing he remembers is chasing a zygon and getting married to Queen Elisabeth. The end of time happens and he thinking he had previously killed the timelords and the timelords knowing from their perspective that the Hurt Doctor had just stolen the moment all parties assume the doctor destroys/destroyed Galifray. He sends them packing and turns into Smith. Smith as the oldest doctor during DotD remembers about all of this and now knows Galifray Stands.

So there isn't any paradoxes or parallel universes. I know that TEOT takes place before and slightly during DotD because the General in DotD mentions the high councils plan and how it already has failed.

Sanctions can work for creating political change. You only have to look at Iran to see that. Their economy was crumbling under the sanctions, and so their leader saw fit to allow a more moderate diplomatic politician to run and win the presidency.

Sanctions hit everyone in the country unless you're the richest 1%, or even less really. Even if you own a large factory what happens when you can no longer export your products abroad? As a business owner you suffer, millionaire or not, your workers suffer and everyone who supplies the business suffers. That's the point, if you hit everyone in the country hard then their rulers will have to sort the problem out or end up with their heads on pikes. Either that or the rich in the country will bankroll other politicians who are willing to sort the mess out. Either one works. 

Sanctions don't always work of course, for various reasons. Some countries are not very reliant on the west, or the sanctions don't go far enough (because ultimately sanctions mean we also lose trade and money), some countries have a lot of natural resources so it's just a case of siphoning off slightly less oil money and giving it to the people to keep them happy, and some countries are politically bankrupt and there just isn't any hope of political change for the time being.

She chuckled and said:
It's easy enough to write rules of war when you're in a well tailored suit, in some warm building in one of the safest countries in the world.
If the enemy is dropping into your land with the intent to kill you, you do what you can to drop them before they drop you, and screw the convention. Simple as that.

The back line needs resting, Ivan needs to come back into the CB position, with Azpi on the right, and either Cole, Bertrand or Kalas on the left, although I'm not sure about injuries with those 3.

We lost today's game because of one reason, Jose. He made potentially one of the worst calls I've ever seen in a match.

Ronaldo is not as complete as Messi. His technique is on point. its on par with Messi, but he does not have the same ability to beat a man that Messi or Suarez does. Also he lacks the same creativity that messi has. I would say that Ibrahimovic and Suarez are just as good as Ronaldo. 

I like ronaldo, I think he deserves the ballon d'or this year and i think he'll get it. But I do think he's a tad overrated. Plenty of players that can match his style and the play he offers. I think Bale is on course to do so. Ibrahimovic is special because he creates chances for other players. Just today he had two perfectly placed assists. Suarez is special because of his ability to create out of nothing. His one on one skill is some distance ahead of CR7's. Take everything into account and its only Messi that does everything. The remaining three balance out and I don't think any one is better than the other. If you were a manager and you had a choice between Suarez, Ronaldo, or Ibrahimovic who would you choose?

true,bustanuttson,null,null,"I'm cautiously optimistic about next weekend. Our away form hasn't been all that impressive, and Hull was our worst team performance yet. That being said, we go into this game having scored 9 goals in 2 games and playing some truly brilliant football along the way. Suarez has been playing beyond his usual scintillating self and Coutinho is looking sharper and sharper every game. Those two in form alone is enough to scare many teams, but minus a few mistakes at the back, the whole team has looked tremendous over the past two games at Anfield.

Agger was good on Wednesday, but I'd argue Sahko was even better today AND he scored. Skrtel has been a rock since getting back into the squad and once again played the part against Norwich and West Ham. His own goal today wasn't his fault, he had to make a play on a high ball headed straight for Maiga and unfortunately it happened to go off his studs, stranding Mignolet. Besides that he commanded Liverpool's penalty area with courage and authority, sticking his head wherever it needed to go to get a touch and putting in crunching tackles you could hear through the telly. Speaking of the big Belgian, Simon showed yet again what a terrific keeper he is with a beautiful reaction save on a bullet header from Maiga. Even his distribution was good today, the throw to sterling was tremendous. Nothing he could have done about the goal, and he still continues to prove himself our best signing this summer. 

Johnson was terrific going forward and at times I thought Liverpool could have involved him even further as they seemed to be playing quite narrow and he was wide open so often on the right after Sterling or Hendo cut in. He did lose his man on the goal but still the solid game we've come to expect from him. There are very few right backs of his calibre in the Premier League and we are lucky to have him. 

Flannagan looked a pace off today. Got beat a few times, misplaced a few passes and generally didn't look as confident as he has over the past few weeks. He struggled with the strength of Diame, Nolan, Demel and Maiga, but still kept Downing relatively quiet. He's still going to be a very good player, but I think he has been playing exceptionally well and he was bound to have an off game.

The midfield looked sharp, especially before Gerrard came off. He did misplace a few passes in the first half, but overall he was sharp and energetic. He constantly demanded the ball in deep positions, but got forward well too, linking with Suarez, Coutinho, and Sterling to great effect. Henderson also got himself into good positions to score, but his confidence in front of goal is low and his finishing continues to let him down. I predict that once he finally puts one in, he'll start scoring on a more regular basis. Typically industrious in attack and our best presser, he again put in the type of the performance that makes me appreciate him more and more every game. 

Joe Allen also put in a solid performance today as well. His passing was very good, it seems in recent games he misplaces one or two simple balls but he was sharp in possession today and found space really well in midfield to operate effectively. He also pressed well and what I liked more about this performance from Allen as opposed to other games was his desire to join the attack. His willingness to carry the ball at the defenders, draw them ink, then lay balls into space was crucial to our attack today and provided numerous chances. The weight of his clipped pass to Kelly was superb. 


And now onto the attack. Coutinho was mesmerizing at times today, his ability to run with the ball is a joy to watch and he looks to be back near his best after these last two games. He pulled the strings and orchestrated countless attacks, sending Suarez and Henderson clean through twice before letting West Ham off. He provides the key to unlocking even the tightest defences and most importantly, links our midfield and attackers, always providing an outlet for Suarez looking to play a one-two or Gerrard looking to play the ball forward quickly. He was a menace all day and the only thing you can say about his performance is that it's a shame he didn't get on the scoresheet himself. He clearly has the brazilian magic and tendency to dazzle. 

Suarez was good, it wasn't his best game but he still could have scored a hat trick, testament to how impossible he is to keep quiet, even on his off days. Hopefully they give the fourth goal to him but I don't think they will. Not much else you can say about him, he's world class, sublime, and possibly one of the best three players in the world right now.

Sterling was terrific today. He was dangerous throughout, ran with the ball confidently and put in a solid shift defensively. I was on the loan train for Raheem but after today's performance, maybe there is something the boy can offer us over the course of a season. Still a terrific prospect for the future and is in the right place to develop his talent. 

Really excited about this team, I think we should stick with this exact lineup, although I thought Martin Kelly looked really sharp in his 20 minutes and if he feels ready for 90 minutes of Premier League soccer than I think we could use his strength against a Spurs team with the likes of Dembele, Paulinho, Chadli, and Walker, who are all big boys. If Gerrard is out then Lucas will slot in for him and we'll probably play an even more possession based type game without the captain there to ping balls forty yards onto teammates feet. Spurs are still trying to find their most effective starting 11. I think Walker is their best player and he was terrific today against Sunderland. However, Sunderland are bottom of the league for a reason and it was another fairly disjointed Spurs display. With our attack in full-flow I expect us to put on a good display at the Lane. Should be a cracking game with at least a few goals in it. My prediction is 3-1 Liverpool

In some circumstances yes, tackling the base issue should be more important, but not here.    

This is dangerously close to blaming the suicide on drugs being illegal rather than the fact that he was hounded into it because people thought he was a rapist and people threatened to hurt him and even kill him.

GK-Next season let Hilario and Schwarzer go and recall Courtois.  Allow Courtois the opportunity to prove himself and keep Cech for competition.

RB-Ivanovic back to CB and Azpi to RB so Cole can come back.  Throughout the season Bertrand needs to play because he has looked great in the past and he will need to be fit for later seasons.  In the summer buy a young RB and give Cole another one year contract. Transition Bertrand/New player in the league games and Cole in Champions League.  The season after we should not renew Cole's contract.  

CB-Hopefully Luiz comes back and we can rotate Terry, Iva, Cahill, and Luiz.  For less intense games play Kalas now that he is fit and integrate Chalobah and van Aanholt into the side next season.  Sign another strong CB in the summer and let Terry go but add him to the coaching staff.

DM-Get rid of Essien in the summer and have Chalobah as a possible option.  Give Romeu a chance at the role again and if he does not do well sell him in the following summer.  This summer we need to pick up a ball distributor while Ramires runs around and does his work (hopefully not shooting unless its a chip).

MF-Keep Lampard another year but give Oscar the opportunity for his role.  Sell De Bruyne w/release clause so he can get playing time and be happy while we make money.  Sell Josh McEachran, Marin, and Kakuta.  Put Piazon on loan to a La Liga team like Atleti and give him playing time the following year when Lampard leaves.  Keep Moses.

FW-Sell Ba, Eto'o, and Torres.  Try to use these players to get another talented, proven striker.  Play Lukaku in league games and the other striker in Champions League games.",0,1386450413,null,0,1386450695,0,cdw1ym0,t3_1sbqm8,t1_cdw1ym0,t3_1sbqm8,null,1428350773,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

Lennon and Chadli were basically non-factors. Chadli had a couple nice headed chances on set pieces, but ultimately didn't do much. Lennon is underwhelming, which is unfortunate. 

Paulinho. His goal was good, but other than that he really provides no benefit to us. His passing is decent and his movement is average. He wastes far too many possessions with his greed. Which is the final point. 

Spurs take way too many shots from outside the box instead of setting up and getting better chances. They need to fix this...SOON.

The uni is a very well respected uni, especially for the arts and media so if you want to work in media its a pretty good call to go there. 
Its worth looking at a few newspaper uni guides to see what you think too.

 I'm also living in private accommodation, but I have friends in the Loring hall and they say its pretty lively there.

New Cross itself is super lively, if you want live music there's a massive music scene in the amersham arms and new cross inn (Blur actually met at goldsmiths and returned a couple of years back for a reuinion gig). There's also a good choice of clubs, and in the day lots of cafe's you can chill at. There's two train stations, so it's well connected into London (4 mins on a train to London bridge for example), and loads of night buses go to new cross so it's always easy to get home.

I'm almost 25 and I was worried that I was too old for uni, but being at Goldsmiths has made me feel really young and fun again, I haven't stopped smiling since I started.  I know I sound like an advert for the uni, but its a great place. I think the only complaint I've heard is that there's no longer a jazz piano in one of the lecture halls!

Unlikely.  You save 20% tax on the money you put into the private pension, and 40% tax if you're a higher-rate earner.

The pension is also protect from bankruptcy etc.

And if you rely on private savings, it is going to *really* suck if you do end up living longer than your pot lasts for.

In the last 5 years CR7 has had an incredible record. Having more than a goal per game, whereas Ronaldo didn't even achieve this in his best year. 

Football is more difficult now than it was 10 years ago. The standards are way higher, it's unlikely that Pele/Maradona would be as successful as the current day CR7/Messi, nevermind Ronaldo.

Plus CR7 isn't even a striker, Ronaldo was.

I guess you could talk about how goals aren't everything, but for a striker, they really are. Im sure CR7 has more assists aswell.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Actually, I'm also a serial immigrant, and I've lived in many countries. This has led me to reconsider many beliefs as I encountered the reality of what other cultures are actually like, close up. I started out with the left-liberal belief that we need to be tolerant and accepting and turn our society into a mish-mash by having huge numbers of immigrants. Over time, I've come to realize this narrative is deeply flawed.

* The reason people from poor countries want to immigrate is to escape conditions created by their own cultures. But they also bring that culture with them and establish enclaves to keep it alive. Therefore, immigration from poor countries keeps poverty alive.
* The tolerance, rationality and humanism of western society is both absolutely unique to us and totally alien to other cultures. Those other cultures place no value on Enlightenment values, since they never had an Enlightenment. In fact, their deeply held reactions to Western values are to ban free speech and democracy and legislate religion.
* Mass immigration is not in our own interests. It's largely a zero sum game where as many people try to gain access to our wealth as possible. The idea Britain would be less successful today if it had not become a sink for people from third world countries is absurd.
* People prefer to be around people who look like they do and ""cosmopolitan"" or ""vibrant"" societies suffer from fragmentation, failure of democratic process and lack of social cohesion. Rather, those ""vibrant"" societies end up dominated by identity politics. That also means society fails to care about its own, which is very much the problem in Britain right now.

&gt;I think it's an outdated anachronism, and the sooner it's gone the better. The newspapers don't like to mention that it wasn't that long ago they'd have a picture of a semi clad fifteen year old covering her breasts with her arms, and a caption telling you how many days until her sixteenth birthday when you could get to see them. I do think adults ought to be able to view naked adults if that's what they want but not in national newspaper that's often on view to children, especially impressionable young women who already have to deal with enough body image crap as it is.

His claim here can be summarized to say that the display of pornographic material in a widely read newspaper is damaging for children, young girls especially as it perpetuates unrealistic expectations of body image and if I may infer a severe objectification of women in popular media.

How exactly can you evidence to support these claims, do you expect him to link some study that displays the different psychological trends in societies in which these images are displayed in newspapers are those which are not, with that then you simply run into a huge array of issues in how this investigation should be approached and hundreds of avenues to use it to support either side.

What exactly would we be gaining from this other than to bring in a pedantic aspect of fact checking and clumsy expectation of citation in what could be a just as interesting conversation without it all.

You say his opinion is valueless without any such citation but I say it's practically nothing whatsoever to the conservation.

Now, in the US the federal prisons are renowned for being horrific in what the inmates do to each other. State prisons are considered a ""level down"" down from that.

Yet, even in state prison, he told me that rape was common, severe beatings and stabbings were a regular occurrence. There would be guys who would walk around with a bandana hanging out of their pocket. There would be another, generally younger guy, who would walk around behind this guy holding onto his bandana. The guy holding on was his bitch. The bitch would be fucked as the master pleased, he would sometimes have his teeth removed (guess why?), he would sometimes be made to wear make-up. The most horrifying thing I heard was that a bitch would commonly be sold for sex, for between 10 and 20 cigarettes.

Now just to bring that to a reality. You've got a guy who went to prison for, say, dealing some weed, being held down and having his teeth removed so he can't bite people's penises when they force him to give them blowjobs, and then being ""sold"" to be raped so his ""master"" can have 10 cigarettes.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Examples: Carriers, the whole SA80 replacement fisaco, and uparmouring of troop transports. Terrible management.

I'm not sure these actually *are* terrible examples of procurement from an MOD perspective.

Sure, there have definitely been a lot of examples of god awful procurement within the MOD but the examples you list really aren't great ones.

For instance, the Carriers were procured in the only way they could (UK Navy ships have to be built within the UK). There are some famous fuckups with the carriers, and the project has been criticised for building non-nuclear carriers, carriers without cats and traps, the whole ""We're going to stick cats and traps on them afterall"" shortly followed by the ""never mind it's quite expensive"" - the choice to move to F-35C's reliant on the above U turn, followed by the necessitation to move to F-35B's following the second U turn. That said, every single one of these fuck-ups was due to politicians being either too cheap or too stupid and sticking their beaks in.

The SA80 replacement fiasco, not entirely sure what you mean by this to be honest. The original SA80 was a bit shit, you can notch that down to a mixture of bad engineering combined with the yanks fucking over every single one of their NATO partners by demanding 5.56 x 45mm rounds be used, when the EM-2 design which we were working of (which was a pretty damn fine weapon) used an entirely different cartridge size (one, which, I might add, the US would be far far happier with now and is in the region of the type of cartridge the US are looking at for their next rifles). So yes, as a combination of having to radically fit an ongoing rifle design to US standards and just flat out insufficient engineering the SA80A1 was unreliable. Accurate as fuck, but it broke and jammed a lot. That said, the A2 which we got H&amp;K to help with (At the time a UK owned company so keeping blighty British an' all that) is actually a very decent rifle, and has served the military well.

As to the concept of an ""SA80 replacement"", I'm no expert on these matters but as far as I'm aware the MOD has never seriously looked into an SA80 replacement thus far and the likely replacement for the rifle won't start before 2020.

Can't say I'm too sure what you mean about the uparmouring of troop transports. Landy Snatch's are basically un-uparmourable. They're just not fit for purpose against IED's, and via the UOR system the Army requested a shit load of different types of armoured vehicles in order to find what worked. That was done purely because: A) They needed them now and didn't have time to do 2 years of testing 1 or 2 of each type, unless they were to accept way more fatalities in Afghan, and B) Because as per standard the Govt. sent HM Armed Forces to war without sufficient kit, and so the Army had to use UORs to get what it needed, when it needed it. That wasn't really much to do with the MOD as such, and as per usual, was a product of the government asking the military to do something and the military dutifully saying ""Well, OK then"" instead of ""And what the fuck are we supposed to achieve that with then you cheap bastards?"".

Honestly, I know the MOD gets a lot of flack and there are definitely examples of fucking horrific procurement (the Chinooks we spent half a billion on trying to upgrade to be special forces helicopters, taking 14 years, before eventually giving up and paying to have them returned to normal spec because the program was going so poorly being a supreme example) - but most of the shit the MOD gets is purely because another government comes into power and decides to stick its beak in, cancel programs which are working well but cost just slightly too much for their liking, or are just too damn cheap to fund what's required.

""Time travel is... damage."" How can you deal with marriage with a time traveller, we don't even know the circumstances around how Susan came about. Maybe from the Doctor's perspective, she's not even born yet, maybe the Doctor hasn't even met Susan's grandmother. Maybe sometime in the future, Susan is born, and travels back to be with her grandfather in his beginning. We don't know what happened with the Doctor's previous partner, or even if he had one (Many Time Lords are born from a loom).

There are so many ways to deal with the River/Doctor marriage in a good way, so I feel I can trust the writers with this, and am sure they can come up with something great, should they choose to address it (why wouldn't they? Great story opportunity).

While I'm sure some people might be willing to talk you through it, you should just visit Liverpoolfc.tv, the Wikipedia page, and this site. Read about the history and see if Liverpool is the club for you. 

You've got a lot of catching up to do. I became a fan of Liverpool in 2006 (I'm American so I hadn't even followed football before that). It probably wasn't until 2010 that I could talk like a credible fan, and that was in absorbing everything I could about the club. I'm mostly came off like a Gerrard and Torres fanboy. Now the stuff is in my blood.

But just read up. That's your best bet. And get to watching the matches man. There's no other way to get it than to watch the team and see the fans.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;When the risk is not that you die, but that you never see £2 again, its not so bad. If you earn enough, then even £200 a year down the pan is pretty negligible, compared to the tiny chance of becoming richer than you could ever dream of otherwise.

Yeah but the point I was making is it's about the probability that you will waste £200 a year too. Risk vs reward decisions (when made logically!) require probability of outcomes otherwise you're looking at just the extreme possibilities, in which case you'd never do anything (you can die in the shower for example).

So say you play the lottery twice a week for the entire year and for some reason it is all played in one go and each ticket is a different number combination.

Your worst case scenario is losing £208.

Your best case scenario is multi-millions (let's face it, the exact number doesn't matter, point is you're rich).

The odds of you winning the lottery is 14million to 1, so if you by 104 lottery tickets it's 14,000,000:104 or roughly 134,615:1.

The odds of you dying in a road accident on the other hand is 8,000:1.

This means you're about 17 times less like to win the lottery then die in a car crash.

People don't think they are going to die in a car crash, which is why they drive cars, so why do they think they would win the lottery?

I get your point that people see it as only £2 a week, but it is Hope that is the bane of humanity. Playing the lottery is pretty illogical. The only justified reason to play is that the money goes mainly to charity so you are raising money for (usually) good causes. If you were going to donate money anyway then you might as well.

If you want an end to Page 3, then I have no problem with you trying to convince Sun readers that it's morally wrong, or that there are better things for them to spend their time on.  (Internet porn springs to mind!) 

The other approach you could take which might actually change my mind on this is to come up with good evidence that Page 3 is causing harm.  If I saw compelling research evidence demonstrating e.g. a strong link between viewing Page 3 and violence against women, then I hope I would rethink my stance on this issue.  As it is, I see a lot of claims, with practically no back-up besides appeals to outrage and the fact that some women are deeply offended by Page 3's existence doesn't impress me in the slightest.

Having said that- I think we agree on a lot.  Page 3 is an anachronism and it wouldn't be much of a loss to see it go.

The best argument that I have heard against sanctions is that South Africa was a valuable partner in the fight against communism, and to many on the right who opposed apartheid this was a more important cause. Rhodesia, for example, was not a very valuable ally in any way and was ostracized by the international community, including Britain, for policies similar to apartheid. 

To answer your question though - both schools are not right. Sanctions work, as is becoming obvious in the case of Iran. It is not the concern of our government whether the targeted country chooses to lay the worst economic effects of the sanctions on the poorest members of their society, since they will choose to hurt the poor whether sanctions are applied or not (this was more true of South Africa than any other country I can think of).",0,1386465478,null,0,false,0,cdw84e2,t3_1sbhws,t1_cdw84e2,t3_1sbhws,null,1428347767,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels through time and space in his TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space). The TARDIS is bigger on the inside, and doesn't always take him where he wants to go but always takes him where he needs to be.

The Doctor is a Time Lord, but he seems to favour Humankind over the Time Lord society of Gallifrey, as he almost always travels with a human. At one time he was elected the president of Gallifrey, but he never consecrated his rule and ran away (during the time of the Fourth Doctor).

When we meet him in 1963 he is traveling with his granddaughter (we don't get any further explanation) and two school teachers. He is sometimes stubborn, at other times extremely kind. Always the Doctor. At the time he leaves us to regenerate into his Second incarnation, he is said to be about 450 years old.

The Second Doctor appears younger than the first, and is also quite misleading. He appears to be frazzled easily and excitable, but is often planned and composed underneath. At the end of his life, he is put on trial by the Time Lords (first time we meet them) for interfering with the affairs of other races in the universe - which is against Time Lord philosophy. They forcibly regenerate him into his Third incarnation, strip his mind of memories of how to pilot the TARDIS, and strand him on Earth.

The Third Doctor, exiled and alone, works with the paramilitary scientific organisation U.N.I.T to protect the world from alien menace. Suave and quite clearly the smartest man in the room, he is the dashing action hero Doctor. He is the first of many subsequent Doctors to encounter and travel with Sarah Jane Smith. He is also the first Doctor to encounter The Master (at least from our perspective as viewers). He eventually regains control of his TARDIS, but not long after succumbs to lethal levels of radiation after destroying the lair of a giant alien spider.

After regenerating into his Fourth incarnation, the Doctor seems alarmingly alien. With a fondness for jelly babies, an absurdly long scarf, and piercing eyes, the Fourth Doctor is at times both hilarious and terrifying. An action during his lifetime may have been the first step in the Time War, when the Time Lords send him on a mission to the planet Skaro to prevent the creation of, or change their evolution to a milder form of, the Daleks. However, when given the chance to touch two wires together and destroy the evolutionary progenitors of the Daleks the Doctor decides that doing so would make him just like them. ""Do I have the right?"" he asks himself, before ultimately deciding against genocide (more on that later). The Fourth Doctor eventually seems to age badly, and suffers a harrowing regeneration at the hands of the Master in the body of Tremas of Traken.

The Fifth Doctor is once again rejuvenated. Appearing younger, more brash and a man of action, and one thing we hadn't observed yet in the Doctor - vulnerable. He travels with many people during his time in the TARDIS. He once helped his four previous incarnations defeat the Time Lord Borusa in his quest for immortality. Unwaveringly generous, the Fifth Doctor sacrifices his life so his companion can live when they are both infected with a deadly poison with only one antidote. The regeneration is the most traumatic yet.

As a consequence of such a traumatic regeneration, the Sixth Doctor starts out as an arrogant, alien, violent man. He softens as he ages, and ended his life after becoming one of the most benevolent and kind incarnations. He was once again put on trial by the Time Lords at the behest of a mysterious Time Lord - The Valeyard. After a long trial, it is eventually revealed that The Valeyard is an amalgation of all the darker parts of The Doctor from somewhere between his 12th and Final incarnation. He had a fondness for cats, and an.... interesting sense of dress. He regenerates after being chased by The Rani, an evil Time Lady, and crashing on the planet Lakertya.

The Seventh Doctor is much like the Second Doctor at first glance. Appearing bumbling, buffoonish, he later reveals himself to be the great manipulator. Cunning, mysterious, and devious, the Seventh Doctor will even manipulate the feelings and lives of his companions to serve his ends. It is after an encounter with cheetah people and the Master, that we leave the Doctor and Ace after a 26 year journey on TV. Somewhere, the tea is getting cold!

....

But that's not the end! In a fleeting moment in 1996 we learned that the Seventh Doctor died on New Year's Eve 1999 in San Francisco (timey wimey) after a botched operation to remove two bullets from his chest cavities causes his two hearts to go into ultra fibrillation, or something. After regenerating into an Eighth incarnation, he suffers temporary amnesia and has to race against the clock to stop the Master from stealing his body and destroying the world! We later encounter the Eighth Doctor during the end of his life in the midst of the Time War. A sworn pacifist, he had avoided getting involved in the war for the longest time, but he could not avoid it any longer....

And that's all I can say. If you watch Series 1-present (2005-now) with all the episodes in order and the minisodes, the gaps in the story will be filled in. For extra points, watch Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures concurrent with Doctor Who as well. Enjoy!

**The premier league season** runs from August to the following May. Every team plays every other team twice (once home and once away) and then at the end the team with the best record is awarded the league title (no playoffs or elimination rounds). The top *four* teams in the premier league also can play in the Champions League the following season, and some of the other top teams (it's a little complicated) can play in the Europa league. So even if you don't win the league, there are huge benefits to finishing as one of the top teams.

**The league cup** is a tournament-style knockout competition that happens mostly in the fall. (This year, Liverpool has already been eliminated from this).

**The FA cup** is a tournament-style knockout competition that happens mostly in the spring (for premier league teams, anyway). Both the league cup and the FA cup include teams from several levels of English football, so you'll see a lot of team names you don't recognize in the early stages. These matches generally happen during the week, as there are still regular premier league matches on the weekends while these cup competitions happen.

**The Champions League and the Europa League** are pan-European leagues that allow the best club teams from various countries to compete against each other (the champions league is the more important one). These leagues play their matches during the week, so if you're in one of them, you play premier league matches on the weekends, and then there's a Champions/Europa league match during the week. 

The ""good"" news for you is that right now, you only have to worry about/understand the premier league. Liverpool has already been eliminated from the league cup, and we didn't qualify for the champions league or the europa league last year, so right now we're only playing premier league matches.

In the winter we'll start to play FA cup matches as well, and that works the way most sports tournaments do in the US, so if/when we lose a match, we're eliminated and we go back to just playing the premier league matches on weekends with nothing happening during the week.

The goal for Liverpool right now is simply to finish this season as one of the top 4 teams in the premier league. That would mean that we get to play in the champions league next season. This is important partially for glory reasons (the winner of the champions league is rightfully considered the best club team in Europe and really the world), and partially for practical ones: teams in the champions league earn more money (because of TV rights, etc.) and can attract better players.",0,1386471188,null,0,false,0,cdwafcd,t3_1scofv,t1_cdwafcd,t1_cdw9xch,null,1428346692,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

But if I think about it logically. Let's say we sell him for 100m, which is more than we would actually get for him. You could get almost 4 players who are good enough to be in a title-winning side. Replacement forward, new leftback and two midfielders. We would probably be guaranteed top 4 for a while. That would be brilliant.

The only issues are you are never sure if new players will fit (sorry AVB) so you could only get 2 good players.

Yeah he's slow as balls, but he's the rock at the heart of our defense and reads the game better than anyone else in that defensive line. To say he can't play the high line and is a shit defender is ridiculous. 

People blasted him because his poor pass to Sandro led to Fulhams goal. But nobody mentioned Chirches missing the ball completely allowing Berbatov to have a shot at goal not 2 mins earlier. Nor the fact he messed around trying to turn out of trouble against United and got dispossessed in our own half.  
But because Chirches is a little more flashy and scored a cracker of a goal it gets overlooked by most fans.

Daws has played the most games this season because AVB knows he can trust him, and because like it or not, he does all the hard boring defensive work, and he does it well.

1) Start with the best of the best. Watch highlight videos of some of the best players/teams/goals etc. This is easy to digest, easy to watch, and almost always ""holy shit, did he just do that?!?"" 

If you dive into full games every week you might get bored by a lack of understanding. ""so some guys just kicked the ball around for 10 minutes then that guy tried to score but launched it so far off target I can't believe he plays pro."" 

The highlight reels will hook you in and provide a foundation for understanding the game. Eventually all that build up play will make sense and start to be very interesting. 

2) Watch games and/or talk with someone who loves the game. His/her enthusiasm will be infectious and he can guide you nuances of the game much better than a video or a book ever could. I spent a summer working with a major baseball fan, that was a decade ago and I've been interested in the sport ever since. 

if you are drinking age, see if there is a bar that opens for premiership games. here in toronto, there are many and some of them can be packed out at 8 am, serving a full breakfast. Not something I do a lot, but I enjoy it when I go. You'll find a lot of die-hard fans there. 

World Cup is approaching, you'll find a lot of people will jump on the bandwagon for that. and since it is in Brazil, the games will be tailor-made for the US audience. For sure you will find packed out pubs showing the games.

Liverpool come with an easy hook right now. Suarez is something else. Find some highlights of him. And in almost every game he will score. I don't care who we play, he is just that good.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"OK, but are you sure the issue with our transfers this summer is *just* that we couldn't get better players because of lack of CL? Granted targets like Costa, Mkhitargaryen and Willian probably were good looks and that's *part* of why we missed them, but I don't think that's the whole story. We still don't have the money to compete with the oil teams for top players, and if we decide to start paying those prices, then selling Suarez is going to buy us two, *maybe* three new players, all of significantly less quality than Suarez (because let's face it, practically every footballer on earth is of significantly less quality than Suarez).

Personally, I don't think it's worth it. If one has trouble adjusting to the PL and/or gets injured or whatever else, then suddenly we're in the same position as before we sold him, except now instead of Suarez we have someone less good. 

Obviously if we have to sell him, then fine, let's get some Bale money and give that approach a try; there is no other option. But if we don't, it just doesn't make sense to get rid of such an incredible talent when there is pretty much no chance we could replace it.

You're right about those stats not telling the whole story due to instances where the high line is not in effect. But that's also partly my point. People are so fixated on the ""high line"" they seem to be forgetting that's only a small part of our defensive scheme. 

High line or not, we still need someone back there who reads the game well, is strong in the air and has great positional play. The best person to fill that role is our captain. Now I am in now way saying Jan, or Vlad are bad players, I think they're amazing, and they will both win us games on their own this season. But we still need that ""meat and potatoes"" defender back there to keep things stable, and allow Jan/Vlad to express themselves.

And at the end of the day, like I said, Daws is up there with Walker and Paulinho as the players who have played the most games this season. So unless AVB is the fool some people seem to think, he must trust Daws to run that defense.

He was them and they were he.  They couldn't run from what he did because in the end, when faced with the same decision, they chose to stand by him.

First of all, fuck you for implying I'm being stupid. I'm well aware of what I'm saying. And what I'm saying is in the form he is in now, I'd pick Suarez over Messi. I don't think there's much between them anymore, and Suarez's work rate and aggression more than makes up for it. There's some shit that Suarez does that Messi is incapable of, and vice versa. Suarez is far more physically suited to playing in the premier league than Messi.

Honestly I can only presume you haven't watched him play much over the last 18 months. If you're telling me that there's still a huge gap in quality between the two then you're fucking stupid.
