true,Honeybeard,uk,Greater Manchester,"Not at all, mate. I love talking about Theology and Religion with anybody. I've been known to make Mormons Missionaries get bored with it.

I studied Theology because I fell in love with the subject. Religious Studies was always one of my better grades throughout my education, and studying it was as much a pleasure as it was a discipline. When I went to university, I really became enticed. The scripture, the antiquity, the languages, the people, the history, and so on. I was fascinated by it, and I still am.

Religious Studies/Theology is still a popular degree in universities, however many Theology departments are closing (my Theology Department had closed and reopened as a Western Religion and Philosophy School.)

My School was roughly 40% Religious, 60% Non-Religious. If you were to go to a Bible College in the southern states of America, you might be taught about the Christian interpretation of the Bible and Christian history. However, my university was a typical secular government university so I was taught the academic perspective of religions. It was nothing to assume Jesus, Moses, or Abraham didn't exist. Religious texts were instead historical texts which social and historical influences. There is a saying that there is no better way to make somebody an atheist than making them study Theology.

The selection process is like one very big interview (which help from a DDO, dioscean director of ordinands). It involves a weekend retreat, multiple interviews, and a few essays. The reason why people don't get accepted are for many reasons: they aren't clever enough, not appropriate for the job, they love the job more than the duties, and more. The Church wouldn't see becoming a Priest like a typical job, they would see it as a 'vocation from God'. So the Church effectively tests your vocation to the becoming a Pastor of God.

This is describing the Anglican Church. I know the process is more vigorous and taxing in the Catholic Church.",0,1372185289,null,0,false,0,caq0oih,t3_1h10ix,t1_caq0oih,t1_caq01il,null,1430687041,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"I had the pleasure of watching him play in person at an away trip and also watched the majority of his matches last season. He really is the real deal. He scores against pretty much every team and given the chance easily snatches hatricks or even more. His goal to game ratio last season is contestable with any other striker you want to compare him with.

I trust the board, Roman and Jose if they want to sign this guy or if they don't want to sign this guy. I'd be okay with both. We really aren't bad at transfers. Yes we fucked up with Sheva and Torres and overpaid but most of our successful and even the minor non-successful transfers are the reason we are here in contention for a top player like him. 

Honestly if we can't pay £49m for him someone else will. That is the question you have to ask in a situation like this that if the player you are buying will be bought by another club for the same money. I can see more 1 other club paying this money just for the sake of his name as well. 

It is easy to see why so many of you are not on board with this and I understand. Deep down I also have that fear that we will pay for him and it will all go to shit but you shouldn't be looking at the players we have gone wrong with because those who we have been successful with are the core of our new team right now and we have got an extremely good transfer success rate in recent years.

Bottom line ; I trust the club and the board to make the right decision. If they are willing and able to pay this fees they will make damn sure it isn't a mistake and also fits our financial spending restrictions. If not then another team will get him and good luck to him. They understand the club and the situation far better than any of us and we need to let this happen (if it somehow does) and give it a chance before we can take away our vote of confidence. If he joins don't be pessimists and already write him off saying we overspend, in this inflated football market he can go for much more than this if he wants to. If he joins treat him with the love and acceptance we showed and are showing to the likes of Mata, Oscar, Hazard who you would have nightmares to part with now. He deserves it too. 

In terms of Lukaku he is not a hindrance. There are teams that rely on their sole striker who win things often. Then there are teams who hold on to more than one great striker, more than one great player in the same position and those are the teams which win regardless of who is around them. They don't need to rely on that one person or things going their way. Think of the top most clubs and they do have this, then think of those who are up there not that often and they don't have this.

Lukaku needs all the experience in the world. What happens if we throw him in the Chelsea lineup right now and it doesn't work? Cavani will help Lukaku not only to learn but also to help be there if things aren't going his way. The weight of the entire club wouldn't be on Luakaku's shoulders which is the worst thing you can do to a young player. I'd be even happier with Lukaku being loaned out to a better side.",0,1372186984,null,0,1372187287,0,caq1csv,t3_1h1v02,t1_caq1csv,t3_1h1v02,null,1430686722,28,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,28

Romney Marsh/Dungeness: A bit biased as this is the area I live in but Romney Marsh is a truly beautiful area thats good to drive/walk/cycle around and there are many nice pubs to stop off at, also Dungeness is a truly unique and bizarre lanscape thats worth a visit, check out the miniature railway.

London: Again, a relatively short trip up the M20 or you could hop on a train at Ashford International, might as well visit the capital whilst you're here. Not really big on banksy info but I assume London's the best place to find some.

France: Hop on a ferry at Dover and visit our neighbor to the south. It's nice to drive around the towns/villages and grab a bite to eat at a patisserie, also you might as well hop into Belgium as you can easily fit that into a day, I'd suggest Ypres, it's a beautiful old fort town near the border that is the home of the famous Menin gate.

Thorpe park: A nice theme park to the south west of London, they have some pretty cool rides there.

Just drive around!: If you have a car at your disposal just go for a drive, theres plenty nice things to see and I do this myself even though I live here. The UK is very well signposted so I doubt you will get lost wherever you go!

That's about all I can think of at the moment, can't help with football as not a fan myself.

NCAA BBall- UCLA Bruins. See above.  

NFL- Baltimore Ravens. LA didn't have an NFL team when I was growing up. Back in 2003, I started watching football and had a couple NFL games for Xbox. When choosing a team for dynasty mode, I couldn't choose an LA team, I really liked the Ravens colors, so I went with them. Haven't looked back since. 

NBA- LA Lakers. Grew up and still live in SoCal and they were my dad's favorite team. Will be a Laker's fan for life.  Long live Kobe. 

Tennis- I love Fed. I know a lot of people who root against him since his days of absolute dominance, and I understand rooting for the underdog, but Fed's just too classy to root against. He's amazing. I also play, and he's just been an idol for me.

Formula 1 : Schumacher is my hero as well but my favorite driver has to be Prost. I've liked Ferrari's since I was a kid (unrelated to F1) so to experience their dominance was great. Going to the race this weekend as well.

Racing : I've done track days but my real love is rally cross. I love my cars at the edge of snapping out. We have our amateur team and I'm the best driver out of the lot (which isn't saying much) but it is extremely fun. Very against illegal street racing and all that, I think that is the wrong route.

Cricket : England are horrible. My brother is a huge cricket fan and I just catch a match with him once in a while but I find myself laughing at England more than supporting them. He gets annoyed because he is very serious about his cricket but I just cant help it.

Tennis : Federer. Can't develop a liking to anyone else apart from Djoko. You are right about Murray and I think his fan base is due to his nationality (mostly). 

American Sports : UFC is the only American sport I watch but that is due to my interest in MMA.

The opposite is 'individualism' - everyone do what you want, relying on yourself, as long as you don't interfere with others' property or rights.

I think what most people think when they hear ""keep religion out of politics"" is that no law should be made just because ""God says so"", and nobody should be judged in the law based on their faith or lack thereof. No burka bans, neutral position on prayer or meditation in public, etc. This also means not granting peerage in the House of Lords to people just for being bishops, for example. Basically, not giving those of certain beliefs an unfair advantage.

What you're saying is contradictory, in my mind. Keeping religion out of politics is usually because ""we don't want their beliefs crammed down our throats"". But what you're proposing does constitute such cramming, and would cause conflict as people force each other to move to One True [x/y/z] for the Greater Good. 

Correct me if I'm not seeing this correctly.

What you'll eventually get is ""thought-friendly states"", small pockets on the planet (or off the planet?) which allow individual thought, and where the public mentality is geared towards such, and you'll get states which claim to be democratic, but where *demos*' thoughts, beliefs, and voting intentions are carefully manipulated from the top (kinda like many Western countries these days) where **politics itself is over-regulated**, and where people with slightly 'eccentric' beliefs get sidelined in everyday life, so much so that they would move to the ""thought-friendly states"" whenever such an opportunity arises, or stay to battle it out. Such states won't only exist for non-theism.

This is a problem because although public transport in and out of London is simple and convenient, transport *through* central London (other than tube lines) is a complete pain. The city was there for nearly 2,000 years before anybody thought of building railways, which means nearly all the above-ground rail lines terminate at what were the boundaries of the built-up area in the mid 19th century.

Just to rub salt into the wound, you're doubly stuffed because despite being in north London, East Barnet isn't really on the tube, so a journey between the two places is probably going to be train -&gt; tube -&gt; train and there's not really anywhere you can live that's going to make it significantly less awkward. Whatever you do, one or both of you is going to spend somewhere between 1-2 hours commuting each morning, and the same coming home in the evening.

That having been said, you need to decide if it's better if you share the pain and both head in opposite directions each day, or if one of you is going to strike it lucky -- if you choose to live in either East Barnet or Gillingham then only one of you will have to do the nightmare commute each day.",0,1372190905,null,0,false,0,caq2wx3,t3_1h1m12,t1_caq2wx3,t3_1h1m12,null,1430685988,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

However, Cavani has not been played in the same role or position as he plays for Napoli, understanding this explains why it is not simply a matter of gelling with the national team quickly which is what usually worries me about players that cannot play for their national team particularly if they have played for one club for a long time.

Cavani has had to learn to play in a slightly different role for his country and this is something that is challenging for any player, especially if you only play that role once every 2 months.

Why on earth would he think that? Just because tension was relieved doesn't mean everyone instantly reverts to complete peace footing. Hell, if history has taught us anything it's that peace footings usually lead to someone trampling over you without warning.

The strength and technique that underpin their game comes from unbelievable training dedication and persistent work as well as specialist agility training and the regulation of running strides technique and weighting. Ibrahimovic has done similar muscular work to Bale (albeit at a later stage) in order to fill out and become the striker he is now but used to be a striker much like Bony is now in that he had inherent ball control and could beat players without needing to use his height or size but had supreme technical ability especially for someone of his height, it made him rather uniquely placed to become the player he is now. (All the hype around Bony could be proved right provided he progresses in similar manner.)

But if other western countries, like Germany, don't spy on their citizens on this scale and are still able to keep them safe - why can't the UK? Germany certainly faces similar threats from terrorism. 

Each time it's suggested the government has crossed the line in spying on us we are told it's needed to stop terrorism. End of conversation. It's supposed to be a trump card. But the German reaction makes me increasingly question to what extent this is true. 

It's a concern that the judiciary and the government seem to be increasingly in bed together with little or no public oversight. It certainly feels like an erosion of democracy. ",0,1372193155,null,0,false,0,caq3tj3,t3_1h1npn,t1_caq3tj3,t3_1h1npn,null,1430685561,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Every one genuinely believes there's no problem with this sort of stuff. It's just very interesting that few people from the school get to interact with ethnic minority groups, ect on a regular basis. I mean, there's definitely a few people from muslim families (it's quite visibly apparent) but they're definitely in the severe minority, and apart from that there's only maybe one or two black guys in the sixth form.

The term racism was first used in 1932, in the context of Nazi theories. Since then, use of the term 'race' has become synonymous with 'ethnicity' which confuses the matter quite a bit, but the original meaning is simply the belief in that human beings are divided into sub-species. Which isn't the true, btw. The OED, using the modern definition of 'race', gives this definition:

1. So my course really depended on the modules you take. We had many Religious Studies (philosophy, study of religion, cults, anthropology) and Theology (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, ancient languages, exegesis, religious history) modules. I leant naturally towards the Theology modules, it was where I felt most comfortable. I did a few Religious Studies modules such as 'Fundamentalism' and 'Indian Religions', however. I can now read Ancient Greek! My main focus was on Christianity, with a second emphasis on Judaism and Islam.

2. In the UK, the amount of church goers and people opting to become Priests has been falling ever since the 80's. However, in other parts of the world (and typically worldwide) it has been growing. Especially for the Catholic Church, swapping between countries is of little concequence - you don't have immediate family to worry about, your work is worldwide, all expenses are paid. I have been to many Catholic Churches in Wales that has African and Indian clergy. In the *Anglican* Church it is different because clergy are likely to have immediate family, and the worldwide Anglican Communion is nowhere as near as homogeneous as the the Catholic Church is.

3. I feel that I love religions that are filled with active members. Judaism and Islam have communities that are centred around their religion, and in part community is the very reason religions sprout and succeed so well. One also cannot become a Jew or Muslim so easily, whereas anybody can become a Christian in the next five minutes if they choose to. With such a massive membership under such an non-committal contract, Christianity has been watered down a lot and lost it's sense of community (with few exceptions, and even they usually turn out to be cultish and dangerous). I would enjoy a secular non-religious society that had religious communities integrated. However, I doubt God would if he does exist.

4. I am shocked that there is hostility to religion in /r/unitedkingdom, but I suspect a lot of Reddit is like that itself. I have a habit of pushing peoples buttons irl to attempt to make them tell me how they real feel, and I haven't met many truly staunch atheists that vervantly oppose religion. I think it's easier to circlejerk and type on the internet a popular opinion. I am all for people having an opinion, and I would promote that. I am against, however, hatred and discrimination of any kind. The new-atheist idea that it is acceptable to publicly mock and ridicule religious people only harms any dialogue and diplomacy between communities.

The problem Bridgend has is akin to many other areas in the UK; a failing manufacturing industry due to cheaper labour in Eastern Europe and the far east, and a lack of demand for the service industry that has attempted to replace it.  Add to that, the close proximity of Cardiff as a drain to retail and to an extent, professional workers, and the place struggles a lot, not to mention the impact of the ""Designer Outlet Village"".

true,free2bejc,null,null,"Firstly, I'd like to apologise for having waited so long to reply, I know that must have been somewhat annoying but I had a final this morning.

I don't actually mean the corporations but powerful individuals who are looking out for themselves and will actively exploit for future gains. The same can be said for corporations but a public image is perhaps more important for a corporation than an individual.

The issue you raise about technological advances is highly interesting. There are several ideas I'd like to explore on the matter. Firstly, I believe that modern technology has actually made democracy more unstable given the speed of the spread of information and the way in which public opinion can sway dramatically and often unreasonably/disproportionately. Digital communication chiefly increases speed but little else, perhaps it increases investigative journalistic abilities but little else (instant knowledge at one's fingertips is hardly exploited by all to the extent it should be and if it was we would have this conversation in pubs rather than debating rooms etc). The danger of such speed being a snap decision or reaction without really using one's own research, instead our 'brainwashing' (for want of a better word) rather than enlightenment is instant. In such a case the danger is of a scandal every week such that larger issues are lowered to the importance of the monotonous others. How to you represent apathy to monotonous drone? Of course the advantage, to a government, of a monotonous drone is the ability to hide larger issues as smaller issues. This is again dangerous to the general populace. Basically the internet media is bound to be a lose, lose for the population of a nation. Perhaps knowledge saturation is possible?

I should probably note that I believe you're an understanding chap so I'm not going to elaborate for fear of essay writing but please do question anything where you can't see any possible logical reasoning (not reasoning you don't agree with as such but any where you cannot see my point of view).

From again, a personal standpoint, I've only ever seen democracy as an incredibly flawed compromise. I'd love to see a benevolent dictator take charge because of the speed of accomplishment achieved through a unified vision. I believe this is the only way we are likely to overcome the challenges facing humankind but I also believe this will not happen because democracy is profitable for the few in the power (all kinds of power) at the time. It would take someone in power to risk losing all power to take the civilisation forward. Not radical but certainly unusual in modern western standards beyond developing nations and never achieved on a worldwide scale. Self-interest is an epidemic plague and unfortunately inherently human (I'm aware how existentialist this sounds but when has human nature ever not been relevant).

I do believe you are using the word status quo oxymoronically there however, I don't believe I was. There are many viewpoints from which to envisage the status quo. As there are many types of power. A power of economy is constrained by government but ruled by corporations. Media power comes through celebrity and general exposure to the public. These are just attempts to show different types of power, for power is just a way to exert a force over someone else, a way to influence their decisions whether conscious of your power or not.

The important thing to understand is perhaps most easily referenced by your ending paragraph. ""Old systems of power in a new world"". Perhaps I am reminded of Huxley's classic but I don't truly believe anything is ever new or has never been thought of before, rather everything is alternate. With this in mind, we have a system of power with an increasingly different outlook upon the world. Is it not more important to suggest that the concept of a system of power itself is what is outdated? If we knew how to function without it then we would not have this discussion. The problem is inherent to power and any system which intends to allow power to be designated. It's far easier and appears fairer to designate power from someone entirely unconnected to you, society, or indeed having any self interest in the power you possess or do not possess. Why do you think God is so popular?

I am frustratingly aware of how paradoxical this assessment sounds and frankly that it sounds as if I could well be high (I am not). I am simply thinking on large scale terms. It is the concept of power in general that is outdated not the systems alone. We have such knowledge but alas we have ""such people in it"".

* A DOF and Manager that work together with a cohesive vision on how the team should operate based on its strengths and weaknesses.  This was ultimately the problem that caused the failure between Comolli and Jol.
* Have a good academy that can create a few homegrown players (either cheap success or sell for a profit)
* Try to limit having a definite NEED to purchase a player.  I think this has cost us when negotiating for a striker as other teams have used this information against us
*  Keep finding players who are in a devalued situation (Holtby for instance) as even if individual players don't work out, if a few do, it would be pretty successful.

Because the way all these people have behaved - controlling information through lies and deceit through no other agenda than their own self-preservation - is just what the powerful have always done, and what groups of people in power will always tend to do. The only thing that's different in modern times is that through outright lies and propaganda, the majority of the public (including me) have spent probably their entire lives believing that the world just wasn't like that any more, that the rule of law was being upheld, that government and state was relatively free from corruption, that those in power were not actively working against the public interest in the pursuit of their own interests. But nobody now can honestly justify that belief.
 
The fact that all this stuff just keeps coming out makes you think that maybe the people behind closed doors just can't continue to operate in this amoral, self-serving bubble in the modern technological world, that information is too hard to control; that they'll be exposed often enough to make the lie not worth telling, and things really could change as long as the public can resist the deceptions of the powerful.

Supposedly this dog is amazing and it was put in the McCanns hire car, which was not hired until after she was reported missing (from what I recall) and it had a similar response.

I'm well aware of it. I just don't agree with the school of thought of ""Putting pussy on a pedestal"" just because I'm a straight man it doesn't mean I should have to worship a woman if I want her affection, especially in this day of equality.

 If I respect someone and treat them well, I expect it to be mutual otherwise I wont waste my time or energy on a woman who was brought up by her parents being told that she is a product of society where she can get whatever she wants, whenever she wants, from whomever she wants by batting her eyelids and wearing a tight top.

I'd also say that other surveys generally back up this data. 

From Wikipedia:

&gt;A Eurobarometer opinion poll in 2010 reported that 37% of UK citizens ""believed there is a god"", 33% believe there is ""some sort of spirit or life force"" and 25% answered ""I don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force"".

Which gives the same 1/4 for people answering no religion, but does point out that 70% of the UK has some amount of spiritual belief.

&gt;The Labour Force Survey asked the question ""What is your religion even if you are not currently practising?"" with a response of 15.7% selecting 'No religion' in 2004 and 22.4% selecting 'No religion' in 2010.[

Again, that's pretty close to 1/4 being completely irreligious. These are people that have no connection, even superficially, to a religion, meaning they probably don't have a religious or spiritual belief.

My best mate is a Spurs supporter and whilst they probably don't need such a robust squad overhaul/number of additions as us, for the first time in 4 years he's watching us with envy as we get to the business end of our transfer dealings before the window is even open.

The start of the summer seemed to be all about getting the attacking options in place. We signed Alberto, Aspas and possibly/hopefully Mkhitaryan in the near future. They will join up with Coutinho, Sturridge, Sterling, Borini (and possibly Suarez), among others to form a formidable set of choices for that attacking four.

The middle of the summer (now until late July) may well be our defensive month, where we truly go after Papa or Alderweireld, and may *finally* get our hands on Ilori too. We may go after cover for LB too but not sure about that.

The last segment of the summer, during the final part of our preseason and the rest of August, may well be dedicated to those final tweaks that didn't get addressed, or that overran from previous weeks. If anything, this may be the time we go after a DM, if at all..or cover for other weaker positions.

Also, don't forget that we haven't exactly started selling yet either, other than Carroll.  Most of our spending up to now has been from that sale and the original 'budget' we had (for which a number was never assigned).  In the coming weeks/month, we could sell any combination of Skrtel, Coates, Pepe, Downing, Shelvey, Spearing, Assaidi, **Suarez** etc.  Once we start selling properly, we'll have more money to go and pursue those targets we haven't got to yet.

No need to panic yet. There are over two months to go in the window and we may have a **lot** of money to potentially spend soon. Not saying or advocating that we spend it all, no way.

East Barnet seems to be squarely [between Northern and Pic](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=east+barnet&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=51.5073,-0.12755&amp;sspn=0.0199,0.038581&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=East+Barnet,+Greater+London,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=13&amp;lci=transit_comp), couldn't tell which would be closer without knowing the exact location.

Neither of those go to Victoria.  They both go to (Kings Cross) St Pancras.  Northern goes to London Bridge &amp; Waterloo.  So the Kings Cross area and Waterloo-to-London Bridge areas would seem to be on top by the logic thus far.

KX is not a classic residential area - used to be a dodgy red light district - but long since cleaned up and the regeneration continues (on a massive scale) behind the station so it's probably only going to get better as a place to live.  More residentially bits nearby - Somerstown, or Islington, if you can afford it.

Between / around Waterloo &amp; London Bridge (inc. Southwark, Borough, Elephant...) is a fine mix of non-residential, places you wouldn't want to live, places you couldn't possibly afford to live, and suitable places sprinkled in there too if you can dig em out - but it's hard to point to a specific patch I'm afraid.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I know this is going to get downvoted to hell, but lets have some perspective here. I am a strong agnostic who used to be an atheist, realistically, I am an unscientific atheist. Consequently, I can understand both sides, and I think the religious lobby and people are badly portrayed here and in the media. What they think and say is entirely logical to them and based on a number of talking points, which I've laid out below.

Note: I am not saying I don't know the answer to these. I'm not saying i couldnt work it out. I'm not saying you are better than me cos you can write a long explaination. I'm saying that this is the crap I hear on a regular basis from people who aren't that religious which stops them identifying as atheists. They are, for what I am saying here, the 'scientific' facts that someone religious who is widely aware of might cite as to why atheism is self defeating and hence a fairytale.

Again, not me, but people i've heard.

One, the whole, first cause, thing. When you have a magical sky god who can screw all the rules, a first cause can be magically handwaved away. Atheism has absolutely no fucking idea what happened before or caused the big bang, only that something cannot be created from nothing. For people who have the magical out of this, atheism seems self defeating. Just saying 'well, that applies to god as well' isn't smart or the winning line you or richard dawkins thinks it is. Trust me, I've tried. Without winning this point, you already lose a lot of people.

Two: the creation of life on earth itself. I'm talking the very first spark, the very first micro-organism. The very first animal that started walking around. Evolution can explain everything from there, but, well, its hard for non-scientists to get that first part. God did it is an exceptionally easy and effective out if, well, you believe in god. Saying 'aliens' or 'random' just adds into the idea of a plan and divine intervention. The fact that the first man lived millions of years after the first woman doesnt help either.

Three: Evolution, now, I get it, for people who care and understand science, its not difficult to get, but when you think of things like the eye, the lungs, big things which can't really mutate easy and quick its hard to see how they all evolved at once. God, again, easy and simple.

Four: Morality. Now, western religion is basically moral philosophy 101 for idiots with an effective enforcement mechanism. Granted, when people grow up most people don't need it, but some people need it early on and wish to utilise it to show other people they are moral. Rather than saying 'we are human beings who can work out what is right and wrong amongst ourselves' 'God says its right and will give you cookies/damnation if you go against him' is simpler.

Again, not saying this is right. i'm saying this is why people who are not religious think that atheism is a crock of shit, and until atheists stop assuming they have already won, the 'dur, stupid theists' line is just another circlejerk for which atheists will be percieved, rightly, as being a bunch of self-centred arseholes.

The main one I'd disagree with is comparing serious damage done by circumcision to serious damage done by FGM.

If you want to compare the ritual pinprick to ritual circumcision, i don't have the slightest problem. But I think your ""losing one leg vs losing two legs"" argument is more like ""losing a leg vs losing a couple of fingers"". Yes, you're allowed to complain about circumcision/MGM, but if I'd lost a couple of fingers in an accident, I'd not want to complain to the person who lost a leg.

I feel the issues are different in too many ways to treat them as equal. I think circumcision is unnecessary and should be avoided, but it would be difficult to outright ban it any time soon, because of how deeply it is ingrained in both Jewish and western society.

Next signing I want to see is Luke Shaw. Very young defender who could be the replacement for Cole (I don't see Bertrand as the full time replacement), and he is English which is another win (but that could bring his price up a bit more).

true,pandanomic,num23,,"&gt;Is Aaron Lennon of Top 4 quality?

On his best days, yes. The real question is if he's on form enough game days. All too often he goes missing in a game, or his role is more of a ""take the ball and run up the side to give everyone else a breather"". Needs to develop an eye for goal from farther than 6 yards.

&gt;Would you rather see Bale on the right, so Aaron squeezed out of the team? (Please don't make this a Bale discussion)

I think Bale our best RW/LW/CAM. No different than asking if he's better than Holtby at CAM. It's AVB's job to figure out a system that uses all of them in the best way. Right now I think Bale is better at CAM and keeping Lennon on the right, or maybe stick him on the left and put Townsend on the right.

&gt;Does Senor Lennon fit into AVB's system?

See my answer above. I think he does, but he needs to add more dimension to his skill set. Either eye for long shots, better crosses, bigger physical presence, or creative thinking. I think just improving/developing one of those keeps him as a starter.

&gt;Are you hellbent on signing a winger? Tom Ince, Bernard, who? And why?

I'm not. Between Bale, Lennon, and Townsend we're fine on wingers. Coupled with Siggy (and maybe even Naughton, kid's got a sick shot and I think he'd be more useful on a wing), we're fine on depth.

&gt;How do you rate Azza, out of 10?

Hard to quantify...

He's a box to box mid, and the double pivot there usually consisted of a play maker and a pure destroyer. 

On the other hand, they've used the 433 at times last season to great effect, and he'd fit in well there. Also, Ancelotti is a known fan of powerful and versatile center mids like Paulinho, evidenced by his use of the 4312 formation in the past. But he just joined Real Madrid, so it's a little early for him to start pinpointing transfer target. 

Again however, it is reported that Perez makes transfers above his managers heads without thinking of tactical needs. You have to wonder the if Paulinho is a Perez kind of player, considering the fact that he's not a superstar yet and that Barcelona just bought the only player in Brazil better than him.

So I'm on the fence. I still am nervous about us getting him, but I don't think Real Madrid will be the ones to ruin our dreams. Would Ancelotti want him? Maybe, there are already a lot of CMs at his disposal if he plays the 4312, but with the loss of Essien and Sahin he could be looking to bring players in. 

Would Perez want him? Again, maybe. They've yet to make a statement signing. Announcing Paulhino right after Barça nabbing Neymar would cast the club in a bad light, but maybe they want to secure the Brazilian market they lost by losing Neymar.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"No. Not at all. IMO it's completely contrary to science to hold the position that you are certain there is no god (atheist) and simultaneously hold the position that you do not have sufficient information to answer the question (agnosticism).

A gnostic atheist is a regular atheist. If you read the famous quotation from Bertrand Russell about how he's not an atheist but an agnostic he makes it quite clear - as did Huxley in popularising the word - that he's not an atheist because he lacks the knowledge to declare that position to be true. An atheist says ""I know there is no god"", if he's not delusionary then he can prove it.

I've never met anyone who could carry on a reasoned discussion of the subject who is an actual atheist (despite their claims to the contrary) they're almost always agnostic or apatheist if they're 'practical atheists'.

Flint's line of reasoning quoted in your link is basically *petitio principii*. You can run his argument by saying ""assume there is no good reason for believing a universe can exist without a deity"" and arrive at a position of agnostic-theist.

As for Kalas, I dont know much about him. Same goes for Delac.

For Chalobah, I would love to see him make an impact with the squad. He had some truly worldclass moments in a stellar season last term. I am not sure if his small frame would be a great fit at a senior level yet so he could be solid as a holding midfielder similar to what he did under Zola. I really see something special in him and on a personal level, I love him. 

Loftus-Cheek is a wildcard to me. I haven't watched enough of him to come to a full decision but I am unsure as to whether I buy-in or not. A lot of that has to do with his age.

It pretty much is.

The only real difference between a Eurostar train journey and a regular one is that you show your passport before getting on board. The security process is absolutely nothing like as tedious as when boarding a plane.

There's a Eurostar terminal in Ashford itself, which reduces the journey time somewhat making a day-trip to Paris fairly doable.

Last time I checked there were something like a dozen trains per day, so if you took a 6am train from Ashford you'd be arriving sometime around 9am French time. 
Wander around Paris for the day then take the evening train back at 9pm, arriving back at Ashford at 10pm UK time.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"Well, clearly for highly religious people, or more specifically in this case committed Christians, the fact that there is a God, is simply that.  A fact, which they cannot question or deny.  They don't see it as so much a belief, as much as something which is simply true.

To use an analogy, we can't see the wind.  But we can feel, observe and measure its effect on things, including ourselves.  A lot of Christians take a similar view of God.  No one has ever ""seen"" God.  But they see God every day in things around them in the same way.  Whereas you or I might have other explanations for certain phenomena, for them it is perfectly natural to see this as acts of God.  We might see a sign that has fallen over, and assume it was caused by the wind.  Even if we didn't feel or experience the wind.  It's natural for us to confidently believe that a gust of air caused it to topple.  Christians confidently see other things around them as being done by God in just the same way.  There's no need to question it, because it's ""normal"".

Given this wealth of (to them) ""evidence"", they feel that they can take the view that it actually requires more of a leap of faith to deny God's existence, than to accept it.  Because we are going against the natural observable acts of God that surround us.  Obviously the causes of it are down to taking a highly subjective view of something.

I'm not defending Christianity.  I'm not a Christian myself.  And I'm not claiming that all Christians think like this.

* In appreciation (and probably to tweak me), my friends gave me lots of *Doctor Who* related presents, including a videotape of Steven Moffat's *Curse of Fatal Death*, DVD's of the Peter Cushing movies, and lots of episodes in whatever form they could get their hands on them. Doctor Who became part of my personality despite not really being that huge of a Classic Who fan.

* But partially because of peer pressure and partially due to nostalgia, I joined in as soon as I could to see the Davies' reboot of *Doctor Who*, and I've been a fan ever since. (Since I'm a cord cutter, I now get my episodes now from iTunes season passes.)

I think the parents have authored an ""Our Story"" type book on the disappearance, and they and the fund surely have income from other sources.

The money is held in a private limited company, because under UK charity laws a charity can't support only a single person. 

So superficially that's their money and they're millionaires.

However, even if it were administered as a legitimate charity, it's credible that each parent might be paid (say) £100,000 as an annual wage for their executive management position working for the fund.

"" In the strict sense, however, agnosticism is the view that humanity does not currently possess the requisite knowledge and/or reason to provide sufficient rational grounds to justify the belief that deities either do or do not exist.""

No, agnostic in itself has a very specific meaning on its own. Just because you're smugly aware of the special cases doesn't mean you can claim those special cases are the default. 

In your confusion you've even started making up words, like ""True Agnostic TM"". That's what an agnostic by definition is. Your modifiers and special cases are not the default. They're just a tool for you to feel intellectually superior in conversation, by being the guy who adds vaguely-related additional info just to hear themselves speak. 

In any case even in your examples agnostic is a modifier of theist or deist, not the reverse.

In my childhood and teens the locals were saying the same about the influx of Indian and Pakistani families to the area as they are about the east europeans now.  

I also saw the town transform from manufacturing (Perkins Engines, Baker Perkins, Peter Brotherhood, EMAP magazines and British Rail) to services (Pearl Assurance/AMP, Lloyds TSB, Churchill, Budget and numerous other call centres) only to see that start to go tits-up in the mid-2000s when companies like Pearl and Lloyds started to close down operations or downsize and move their call centres to India.  

Pearl went from being one of the biggest employers with 3500 people to less than a quarter of that in the space of 18 months.  Even before the latest recession things were starting to get tough job wise, about the only places left now are the big distribution hubs like Ikea.  

Working in IT in the early 2000s I could pretty much get a new job within a month, by the time I left in 2006 most of the roles had gone to Indian call centres and there was a glut of recent graduates who'd been promised big money working in IT only to find that they'd be lucky to get jobs on a helpdesk or a short term contract moving PCs around.

I'd hate to be in my teens or 20s living there now, there's hardly any 'professional' jobs, and not many more working in the warehouses or supermarkets.  I'd want 'something done' about it, and it's easy to blame the unemployed/poor/immigrants for all the town's woes.

Firstly the initial triage was the perfect example of the dumb-script system that everybody (quite rightly) hates. The operator was the perfect example of the bored ""computer says no"" crowd, refusing to deviate at ALL from a massively overly long script that was obviously stupid .....

111: Can you rate your pain from 1-10?

Me: I'm not in any pain

111: would you describe it as a sharp pain?

Me: I'm not in any pain

111: does your pain give you a crushing feeling in your chest?

Me: I'm not in any pain

111: is the pain constant?

Me: I'm still not in any pain

111: does the pain get worse with bright light?

Me: your not getting this are you?

(this went on for at least 15 questions ... and was not the only example of such stupidity)

I'd called in because for the last 6 weeks I'd been having some respiratory problems (history of asthma, chest infections, etc) - I'd seen my doctors multiple times but that was about 00:30 on a Saturday and my symptoms had been getting slowly worse for about 6 hours. This was well short of an emergency, I'm not stupid enough to leave that sort of thing until it gets bad, I wanted some advice on managing symptoms overnight or info on drop-in centres I could go to.

What I got was a *ridiculously* long script, followed by the bored operator saying: ""right, I'm going to call you an ambulance now"". At this point I literally had a 15 minute argument with the operator and the nurse he got on the line.

(10+ mins into the call at this point)

111 staff: we have to call you an ambulance, you are in respiratory distress and it is very dangerous

Me: Look, this is getting stupid. I DON'T need an ambulance. I'll head to A&amp;E since you guys are incapable of giving me any advice but I'll get there under my own steam.

111 staff: No, no - you must go by ambulance! They have all the equipment and training for it you get into trouble on the way!

Me: Okay, one last time; THIS IS NOT AN ACUTE PROBLEM - it has been carefully managed for over 6 weeks now and has just got marginally worse.

111 staff: But it could get worse while you are travelling, I'll hopefully have an ambulance to you in 15-20mins.

Me: NO! I'll be at the hospital in 5 mins, they are only round the corner and my girlfriend will drive me. I could probably walk there faster than an ambulance could get to me, even in my condition!

111 staff: You sound out of breath an distressed, I really need to call you an ambulance.

Me: I'm out of breath and agitated because I'm arguing with you. The stress of stopping myself screaming at your is not helping. I'm going to hang up now because you are not listening to me. If you call an ambulance it will arrive at an empty house.

When I strolled into a (mercifully) quiet A&amp;E &lt;10 mins later the staff there had a fax through from the 111 service detailing my case. Most of it was wrong. The main comment from the staff was ""yeah, you would still be waiting for a ambulance, much quicker this way. Can you head through that door and take the second right? Somebody will direct you into a treatment area and get you sorted out."". Totally calm, totally professional - and that was just the reception staff.

Personally I think the 111 service is an utter waste of time and resources that could be better spent on more staff/lines for the NHS direct service.

The completely **FREE** two-week summer camp is aimed at 17-19 year-olds with qualifications in STEM subjects – Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. There are **80 places** up for grabs. CodeCamp will take place from Monday 22nd July to Friday 2nd August.

As well as giving participants a fantastic grounding in app creation CodeCamp will give budding young developers a real sense of what it’s like to work in the software industry.

CodeCamp is a joint initiative being run by Kainos and Belfast Metropolitan College (BMC), and will be hosted at BMC’s brand new E3 Campus.



Those accepted onto the scheme will use MIT AppInventor to create real apps for Android Phones that can be published to Google’s Play Store.

AppInventor, developed by Google and maintained by MIT, offers an easy-to-learn, fun way to get to grips with software development.

***What you’ll get out of CodeCamp:***

A good grasp of how software is designed, built and tested
A chance to bridge the gap between ICT subjects taught in the classroom and real software development
Access to a Kainos or BMC mentor who will assist with individual and group work
The chance to attend ‘breakout’ presentations by mentors on key subjects – such as roles in IT, career options, salary bands and cool new technology
Your app will be judged by the Kainos and BMC teams and could win a great prize
If it’s a real winner it could make it into the Google Play Store!

***What you need to know:***

Laptops are provided by BMC – but bring an Android phone or tablet if you have one

First and most importantly he is coming from a lower league than most of the European leagues yet Inter are still asking anywhere from £14m - £20m (depending on the day it seems), has (or at least had) 3rd party ownership and Inter's president is similar to Levy in terms of dealing with. I know he has been talked about to Spain, Russia and Italy the past few seasons but it seems like Inter's president does everything he can to ensure that the deal falls apart.

Secondly, i reallly think he and Inter wanted him to stay with the Confed Cup, World Cup and Olympics all coming to Brazil. I think Inter felt that having the potential Brazil #9 in house and on local soil would land them more money. I think Damiao felt that by being in Brazil he could roll up huge performances and cement his slot on the roster.  Result is that it felt like Inter and Damiao were creating a moving target for a transfer, if someone came in and overpaid then he would leave otherwise he was willing to stay in Brazil and work on becoming better known to the Brazilian public before the the world Cup.

In the end i think for what happened was simple, Inter hasn't had a major need to sell him and has been greedy in their estimation of his value (keep in mind they are asking about £16m and Gomez is rumored to be valued at £17.5m).  Leandro fucking Damiao on the other hand has shown no desire to leave Brazil especially with the major events coming up.  So where we have kept dancing with Inter i think the Shaktar, Athletico Madrid and various Italian teams wrote him off as more of an issue to deal with than he is actually worth.

We sold off the water, gas, electricity, public transport (most notably rail), and most of the council housing. Furthermore, introducing a market to the NHS (done largely for ideological reasons) caused an exponential increase in administrative costs to deal with the bidding process and managing the contracts as opposed to just having in-house cleaners etc.

In the South-West where I used to live South West Water just completely take the piss, but of course there is only _one_ supplier (so much for competition?) so the Government doles out money to help those struggling thus subsidising the private industry that we were told would be better.

The rail network is also a joke, far more confusing and more expensive than Europe and the investment and maintenance is all paid for by the Government anyway, because we tried having it private and we got Potters Bar.

Meanwhile the sale of the council housing has left us with a huge housing crisis, but the rent controls and regulations have also been removed. So we are left with extortionate rents to pay off the greed of Landlords and the Governments only answer is to further subsidise this state of affairs.

If we want to do better we have to work together, to run things by and for the people whether via nationalisation or co-operatives. But of course the Media just find the worst people possible and show them 24/7 on Jeremy Kyle, Big Brother etc. etc. appealing to people's innate desire for superiority (it made _Atlas Shrugged_ successful) and making them feel like most other people are just useless scroungers.

I disagree. Maybe they should get some pity because their child was allegedly kidnapped, but they brought it on themselves.

It's the same here - these people decided to go out and leave their children in an (unlocked?) apartment.

Of course, I doubt they will publish anything of the sort, citing 'security concerns'. Some might believe that, others might see it as an admission of the programme's ineffectiveness, the fact that they cannot come up with an example. 

Either way, this programme is a massive step. It is a situation where a government implements total digital surveillance over all its citizens and everyone around the world. We're not talking about points of contact, duration of calls etc. We are talking about complete surveillance, including one's most personal letters. And they dared take this step without consulting the voting public? A step away from a free an open society to a state where the government has a record of everything one does and writes online? Just like that - no questions asked?

What I think is most likely with all this Prism nonsense is that the security services have become deluded by the murmurings of people on Facebook.

Eventually the list gets transferred onto a computer and appended to the investigation case file. Congratulations; you are now an innocent person on a police database somewhere. The horror. Eventually the police discover the group is all-talk, the investigation gets shut down, and the case files archived. But the list is never destroyed; why would it be? What happens if the group actually did commit a crime and the archive needs to be retrieved; should all the previous police work be wasted because we just don’t trust them enough not to be evil?

The Guardian is desperately trying to make something sound sinister which is much the same thing as owning a phone book. So the police have a list of 9000 ‘persons of interest’.

They barely have the resource to monitor a fraction, and even to do that they’d need to gain the same judicial authority they’d need in any other form of investigation.

So you've gone from wanting to be a priest to even questioning the existence of God now? Good thing you didn't become ordained then.

Also, do we have seminaries in the UK or is that just a US thing?

I'm Hindu*ish*. Grew up in a Hindu household but I do the religious stuff probably more out of tradition (it's nice being part of something going back thousands of years) than actual faith. Looking back I never thought we were a religious family but now I realise that we sort of were. Prayed every day, observed festivals, and growing up in Leicester there are always events going on - Holi, Rathayatra, Navratri, Diwali etc. And being in Leicester you grow up with Sikhs and Muslims who are also fairly religious and religion is just a part of life. Religion is so intertwined with the culture you don't think much of it.

That's why I find the anti-religion sentiment so weird. And being Hindu you are supposed to believe that all paths are valid and there is no wrong faith or approach.

And yet, RDM continued to deploy him as a winger.

RDM had no squad rotation, he played the trio way too often. Azpi, Moses and Romeu never had a chance. Chelsea had a heavy fixture and his early success was not going to last. Which was proven that Chelsea was winless for a month before he was sacked. 

The defense was a complete mess. David Luiz running around like a headless chicken. Azpi not even given a chance. And with Mata not knowing what to do, in fact, nobody did, it was a disaster.

true,Grimslei,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"I don't quite understand. You seem to recognise that the term 'atheist' has developed multiple definitions of inclusiveness in regards to every-day usage and yet have chosen to only recognise it (and consequently assumed that I have used the term) as the strict, regular ""I am certain there is no God"" definition. Despite the original use or arguable correctness of the term, in everyday usage the most common definition is simply ""lack of belief in a deity"". Whether you like it or not, this is commonly taken in a practical, living-your-life sense.  ""Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity"" (as stated in the article) is not stating that, ""Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they are certain that there is no deity"".

In terms of living, few indeed arrive at an agnostic-theist position from an argument such as the celestial teapot as it requires a shift from the normal, in either thinking or of practice (I assume that you have already encountered this line of thinking, and is what you are referring to as their attempt at Occam's razor?). However, I can describe the reasoning as to how the agnostic-atheist conclusion is more often seen as a product derived from reasoning similar to scientific reasoning for clarity.

It is difficult to argue that before we are each capable of thought we hold a belief in a deity: this is why in more scientific terms the creation of the concept/thought of a deity can therefore be seen as similar to the creation of a new hypothesis. Given a lack of any evidence (or the recognition that applicable evidence does not exist, even) the hypothesis is consequently unsupported in a practical sense. This does not mean that individual does - or must - create and support any counter hypothesis (""there is **definitely** no God""). However, with the hypothesis having 'failed', continuing to lack a practical belief in a deity just as before the thought was first created remains the most reasonable course of action. Note that this differs from the scientific method is in the lack of observation. However, in terms of a lack of measurable evidence, it could be argued that any deity belief hypothesis created immediately fails the method as no measurable or empirical evidence can be provided to give it reason. For a person basing their conclusions entirely upon a scientific approach (or similar) any hypothesis of a deity created by themselves or suggested by others (from the moment that they can think) is therefore rejected.

I would therefore argue that this is indeed the closest scientific approach to this particular argument. The conclusion reached is that one should continue to live his life as if there were no God or gods (touching upon the inclusive/practical definition of atheism) but not claim that the hypothesis is wrong for certain (more precisely, it is perpetually unsupported by a lack of evidence applicable to the process).",0,1372243328,null,0,1372245906,0,caqi4cp,t3_1h10ix,t1_caqi4cp,t1_caqbf99,null,1430678677,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There are a lot of Priests also who doubt God at times (read: years) of their life. The life of the Priest is far from being filled with the Spirit 24/7. I still really miss my spiritual side. I saw some Muslims pray yesterday and got sad.

&gt; So what do people do with a theology degree when they don't become a priest?

The same as with any other scientific humanity degree (e.g. History, Philosophy). Get a graduate job in sales! Haha. Unless you go into a subject specific job, the transferable skills include training in analysis; report writing; independence of mind; reading different documents with ease, and more. Make of that what you will. I would ***LOVE*** a non-religious role within religion. Something to do with multi-faith dialogue or likewise.

&gt; I'm Hindu*ish* ... Religion is so intertwined with the culture you don't think much of it.

I actually have a Hindu mate in Leicester, and we have such good conversations about our religion. Christianity for me is like an armour I put on top of myself, but Hinduism for him is like the bloodflow through his body. He will always be Hindu, it isn't something you adopt or can take away. He isn't the strictest of Hindus whilst at uni, but he doesn't eat beef, observes abstinences from alcohol on holy days, and so on. It isn't a chore as much as it is a delight. I keep asking him to take me to Temple one day.

&gt; That's why I find the anti-religion sentiment so weird... As long as you're not a dick you're fine...

I had a meeting at this hotel in the morning and was waiting for my client to arrive (my client was running a bit late). I saw Mickey sitting by the checkin desk and initially thought he was just a perfect doppelgänger. As I continued to wait (I was standing 1m apart from him) I became more convinced that this could be our man.

At this point I went up to the checkin desk to get a closer inspection with just a random question for the receptionist. That's where I saw his key card and passport lying face up on the counter closest to where he was sitting. I googled ""Armenian passport"" on my iPhone and it was the exact same blue document. I stepped back, took a pic and sent it to my friend (massive Dortmund fan who is hoping he plays in the yellow and black next year). Once he confirmed he thought it was Mickey as well, I walked up and said ""welcome to Liverpool"" he smiled awkwardly / in a scared way and said ""Thanks, lets see"". His English was pretty good based on what he said to me and my eavesdropping of his chat with the receptionist.

My client came in at that point while at the same time a large fat man on a cell phone greeted Mickey - he was no one I recognised, though I don't know what his agent / manager looks like.

I'm a London based red and have no reason to lie to my fellow reds.  I'm also a long time lurker and this sort of stuff pops up here so I was pretty excited I got to share as well.

A lot of people have this rough end of BigGov services, they see the benefit but often not to them, it is easy to be excluded.

During the cuts process, we've seen fewer and fewer benefits remain universal (thou not many were!) and it edges that thought process futher, there is a divide between those who use, and those who don't.

Whilst the op piece appeared to ramble on more about Thatcher and other stuff, they failed to acknowledge this fact.  Benefits today only appear to apply to those who are on the very bottom end of society.  Say your young, haven't had your hopes and dreams completely crushed by the world yet, you aren't going to be in the bottom end, right that will never happen to **you**.

This means all of the big social state services aren't really for you, they are only for *others*.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Let me clarify... Just because we don't feel threatened here, doesn't mean that freedom isn't worth protecting and enhancing. But I'm certainly not hopeless. It's sad, sure, but not dire. Britain just isn't geared for freedom the same way America was. 

I* would like to* think a reason we/they don't like discussing politics in general might be because they don't want to start an argument with the person they are talking to. I'm under the impression that people think it's rude, even though we're in a democracy.

I think the reason people might not care about these issues is because of trust in the Government. I mean, they give people a lot of money, through the welfare system.

Remember that we're not *actually* democratic. We still have a monarch that has a backdoor to hijack everything (but doesn't because we'll riot). The Cabinet can do the same, they also have the power of Royal Prerogative. And it's been [used just recently](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10018301/New-powers-to-strip-passports-from-British-terror-suspects.html).

We don't have a clause in the Magna Carta saying that we have a right to overthrow the Government, Monarch and all, if it turns bad (there is such a clause in the American Constitution). We're ""subjects"". When my parents got their citizenship, they had to swear an oath to the Queen, basically making them and me loyal to the Queen (and by extension, her Government):

&amp;gt; I, (Insert full name), do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.

&amp;gt; I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen. 

As well as upholding the law, we have to serve the monarch. We don't ""protect"" the law from ""enemies"" like the Americans (should) do.

Freedom isn't at the base of our system, it's just kinda mangled in there with other thousand-year-old laws. I think for things to change in the long term, we need to become a republic, and I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying that. :P And not only because this subreddit will have to change its name.

Also, our history is different. No generation here has experienced Soviet occupation, the people don't know what it's like to lose all their freedom.

I wrote about it before, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g1u4r/a_warning_please_read/cag5df2). If you don't have time, here's a TLDR:

Brits don't appear to care, because of:

* A ""nothing to hide"" attitude,
* A high level of trust for the Government,
* A high level of dependence on the Government,
* A lack of technical proficiency, and
* A lack of experience of the effects of loss of freedom.

Europe is different, because Soviets.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;there was a lot of doubt as about his quality as a manager.

No shit.

&gt;For all the tactician that RDM was suppose to be

Eh? When was he ever known as a tactician? His previous teams were known for playing open, attacking football. Bullshit.

&gt;He didn't know what to do with the trio of Mata, Hazard and Oscar.

And yet they arguably played their best football under Robbie. Go figure.

&gt;Mata was playing in the wings, which he was struggling with his defensive duties

No he wasn't, he was playing as a nominal number 10 (as he had started doing the previous season under Di Matteo) with the front three rotating positions as time went on. He wasn't playing as a winger, the three all had fairly free roles, which meant that sometimes Mata had to track people on the wings when the other two had moved elsewhere. Such absurd revisionism to suit your point.

&gt;RDM had no squad rotation, he played the trio way too often. Azpi, Moses and Romeu never had a chance.

He barely rotated the squad because he knew that he was a dead man walking. Hence the almost full strength team against United in the Carling Cup. Benitez could do whatever he wanted because he knew that he wasn't going to get sacked even if he lost to, say, QPR at home.

&gt;The defense was a complete mess.

Agreed on this, it was shambolic. Marginally better under Benitez. Marginally.

&gt;David Luiz running around like a headless chicken.

Did you watch him in midfield under Benitez? Headless chicken. Zero tactical awareness, but he scored the occasional wonder goal, which must have meant that he played really well, yeah?

&gt;Azpi, Moses and Romeu never had a chance. 

Azpi and Moses were brought in late on under Di Matteo - lest it be forgotten that they were both signed quite late. Look at the games.

No-one believes that Di Matteo was the answer for Chelsea. He wasn't. He wasn't good enough. At least criticise the bloke on merit instead of making stuff up. I do wonder if people actually watch us play. Christ Almighty.

&gt;RDM might be a ""legend""

And he is a legend. Putting that in quotation marks makes you look like a cunt. Legend as a player - scored the goal to win us our first trophy in decades. The manager to bring us our first European Cup. That so many of you are willing to throw him under the bus and praise fucking Benitez to the hilt shows what pathetic, fickle wankers you are.",0,1372254582,null,0,false,0,caqkd1d,t3_1h3j7q,t1_caqkd1d,t1_caqi099,null,1430677624,20,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,20

true,ozkah,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Ive thought this for quite some time, not so much in their desire to create a security state but their desire to create a system of self surveillance and voluntary intoxication that in its effectiveness far exceeds the achievements of a totalitarian government. 

We have a fake democracy. We can vote in whoever we want but we only have a choice of three, anyone can be prime minister, but there can only be one, and he's usually from Eton. We decide who represents us and our opinion, but our voice only holds a tune to the politicians once every four years or so, and between those times they use our money to prop up an economy that benefits the rich-elite and then convinces the poor that there the ones that have to make sacrifices, and that the poorest who mulch off of the state are where we should direct our financial frustrations. They take us into a new age of imperialism under the guise that we need to save other countries with democracy, where we send ourselves off to die for no good reason other than to propel the special interests of massive economic ,political and military industrial machines. 

And now there going after healthcare, public services and public goods, lobbyists for privatization slowly eroding public infrastructure, propelled into the undefended walls of public opinion with the Ayn rand type ideology that seems to seep so easily into political life, probably because it makes there jobs easier and there ruthless ambition more so justified. 

And then there is the information streams that turn the public into a passive audience who are absent minded from the factual reality of things, seeing no benefit in the alienating work of figuring out exactly what is going on and what do do about it. 

And we always try to fix it in the same fashion, expecting different results, the definition of insanity fitting for a society that fails to see the wood from the trees.

The LDs had, in particular, prided themselves on their internal democracy but - in the end - it has proven to be vulnerable to the oldest trick in the book: Control of the agenda.  At the last conference there was a concerted effort to bring a motion discussing the single most important issue of the hour in the form of the economy but the whole effort descended into farce with Clegg loyalists handing out leaflets at the door and informing what remains of ordinary party activists that a 'bunch of Trots' were trying to embarrass the party.

Krugman has made much of the confidence fairy but there's another mystical beast bounding about in the form of the credibility gnome; the currency of what's acceptable to the meta-party is described in terms of credibility - this or that notion is or is not credible.  What they seem to mean by that is that it doesn't pass the dinner-party test set by the kind of people who make up the leadership of the parties and who socialise with one another.

I don't really get the thing about English food being bad - we have lots of nice food like traditional breakfast, sunday roast, christmas pudding etc. I don't see how that's in anyway inferior to schnitzel etc. (which is also awesome).

I agree, there are some brilliant English recipes, but no one seems to know how to cook the damn stuff though. So what you usual get is some pale imitation of a once great dish. Thankfully the quality of food has increased significantly in the last decade or so, but we're still a long way behind places like France. 

As for privatization (or as in the case of railways, private firms from the start), there are pro's and con's to it. If you look at the railway network, it was the private sector who drove the creation of the network and did so because there was money to be made in selling the service. Under public ownership the railways largely declined. 

The best approach is when the private and public sectors work together, as we see with the internet. It was public investment that created it originally, but private sector investment which made it what it is today. This is why I can sit here in NYC working on a server in Holland whilst chatting to a guy in the UK.

We've got more pubs and churches than any sensible person might need, including 12th century pubs and churches from the 5th Century onwards. We've got a really disappointingly broken castle (free), and a massive cathedral (usually costs but you can get in free on Sundays after a certain time).

We've got medieval monks' gardens right in the middle of town, a small but pretty river. About twelve million students, and a pub for each of them. Buskers, free music in pubs, open mic nights (a very professional one at The Ballroom, Orange Street on Wednesday). We've got a large and ugly modern theatre, lots of restaurants. You can drink locally-brewed beer and cider (that's the alcoholic type of cider). It's a small place but perfectly formed.

From Canterbury up the river to Ashford - or the other way round - is a lovely walk along the river and through the woods, with rail stations every couple of miles so you can skip bits.

Just north of Canterbury are some beautiful woods all the way to Whitstable, which is not without it's charms in an understated sort of way.

You can have a monstrously good time in Brighton, which is pretty much set up to give London a fun weekend - also they have a new football stadium and a reasonable mid-level team - not so popular that it's impossible to get tickets, but good enough that you'll probably see a decent game. There are a few Banksys in Brighton but iirc the best known one on the Albert is now a replica, with the original somewhere safer. You can, if you bring enough money, buy a Banksy print in the North Laines.

London of course: there's a very fast train from Ashford into town. There's a bit of everything in London. Go see a few bands - up to you which. Babyshambles are touring this summer and they are enormously good fun.

I'd definitely take the time to visit at least one place that's really old - I mean thousands of years. Stonehenge is a bit disappointing, but in the same area is Avebury - a stone circle complex so large there's a whole village inside it. Unlike Stonehenge it's free, and there are no fences so you can go right up to the stones, sit on them etc. Everyone's fine with that.

(*Edit - I just realised you said September so ignore this, but Henley is a pretty little town to visit)* If you're in the UK in the first week of July, Henley Regatta is a very odd event.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; What do we attribute his drastic drop in form this season from his past?

Different system and style of play. With the higher line and fullbacks being pushed higher, Skrtel was asked to cover far more ground than under Kenny, where Steve Clarke set the team up much deeper, more compact, and less proactive in defending. Skrtel's never been particularly comfortable with venturing too far from the edge of the 18-yard box, and hasn't adapted well to the need to cover more ground, or to being more proactive in defending. There's also the possibility that while he's a decent enough passer of the ball, he's not entirely comfortable with playing out from the back, especially when put under pressure.

There's also the fact that Rodgers has decided that he wants certain players in his first XI to exert greater leadership on the pitch, which was part of the reason Carragher got the nod to replace Skrtel in January, and kept his spot since. Skrtel had a big chance to show his leadership ability against Oldham, but struggled badly individually in that game, nevermind marshalling the rest of his back four. 

&gt; Is it too much to want him to find some of that old form considering his age and the fact that we desperately could use it?

The trouble is, CB isn't a position where you'd want to risk 'rehabilitating' a player back into form over a few months; nor can Skrtel regain his form by being played slightly out of position, like Rodgers did with Enrique. And even if we do that, will he be able to provide the leadership skills required? 

It's also worth considering that amongst Liverpool players that aren't essential, he's probably the one most likely to command a good fee (now that Carroll's gone). That's money that could be put to good use in replacing him, not to mention the fact that whoever we sign will be on lower wages than him. 

It's a reasonable enough wish for Skrtel to stay and force his way back, but OP's article didn't do a good job of rationally explaining it. ",0,1372255270,null,0,false,0,caqkk56,t3_1h3mgm,t1_caqkk56,t1_caqkaqh,null,1430677529,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

&gt;I'm sure I'm not the only one that would be uneasy about being clinically assessed by an untrained individual, who relies on a computer system.

You're not being clinically diagnosed though. At no point in the process is the computer system positively identifying something.

It's a process of falsification which for me as a sciencey person is the glorious master race of triage.

&gt;Many people, including health care professionals believe that this service is a failure

I think thats a fair point for the way it was setup initially. no-one knew what they were doing and frankly that was to be expected. Like ANY new system. But it's all about the bigger picture, and one persons grumbles are never a clear indication of failure. Tell me about all the people you and I know NOTHING about that have been helped because they never had to go to A&amp;E or never had to write in about how their husband died because there was no service available to assess them.

Compared to NHS direct... a man with a stick is better.

All three factions of the business party are in favour of parceling out the welfare state to their benefactors, and once out of office they are richly rewarded for it. Look into how well Tony and Cherie Blair are doing, the latter is making a lot of money from private healthcare after her husband made the NHS financially unsustainable through privatisation, which is being used as 'proof' of the inefficiencies of state heathcare. Obviously this has no basis in fact, but the idea that state run healthcare is inherently inefficient is hammered every day in the media and as a consequence the idea becomes common sensical. 

Same thing happened with trains, the state subsidises the railways a lot more now than when they were nationalised and the parts of the railways that the government had to re-nationalise because of private sector inefficiencies are the only part of the railways that are making any money. Guess what's going to happen with health? Think that it will be any different? You might think that this shows that the system isn't working and that something went wrong. It didn't, the system is working fine because privatisation isn't about efficiency it's about wealth transfer from the tax payer to the rich.

The two are not comparable. 999 is there to dispatch an emergency service. NHS 111 is there to give people access to health care when the situation is not quite 999 worthy.

&gt;You're not being clinically diagnosed though. At no point in the process is the computer system positively identifying something.

Who mentioned being clinically diagnosed? I specifically said clinically assessed. 

&gt;But it's all about the bigger picture, and one persons grumbles are never a clear indication of failure. 

Quite right and I would never suggest otherwise. However NHS bosses stated, in May, that the system was still fragile. 

&gt;Tell me about all the people you and I know NOTHING about that have been helped because they never had to go to A&amp;E or never had to write in about how their husband died because there was no service available to assess them.

I don't doubt that some people have received an adequate or better service. 

&gt;Compared to NHS direct... a man with a stick is better.

I can't compare because I've never had to use the 111 system. I can say that I've never had a problem when using NHS Direct and have used that service several times.

&gt;every likes to moan about the NHS despite when it works.

Indeed they do. Having worked for the NHS within a hospital, I know to some degree problems that exist. I moan when it doesn't work. In this instance, the 111 number is filling up A&amp;E departments unnecessarily. 

I shall allow you to continue your AMA in peace now.

It's a bit of a con, really - in the 90s 0845 really meant local rate and 0870 really meant national rate (since phone calls back then were charged based on distance). In the mid 2000s BT finally abolished the last tariffs that did that and they ended up costing more to call.

The story so far for others like me:

Trenton Oldfield swam across the Thames river during the annual Oxford vs Cambridge boat race, stopping the race and forcing a restart which some argue allowed Cambridge to win, even though Oxford was ahead the first time around (Sorry, can't help it, I'm from Oxford).

His reasons for his actions have changed multiple times, sometimes about colonialism and then about gas chambers, and finally about elitism.

He was arrested and convicted for a public order offence. This included a fine, 6 months jail time, and obviously a criminal record.

Trenton has lived in the UK for 10 years and is now married to a British citizen. He is in the UK under a Tier 1 visa for ""highly skilled, self-employed migrants"" which does not require sponsorship but has points requirements based on age, income, experience etc.

He has been refused a renewal of his visa, meaning that when his current visa expires, he will be forced to leave the country. If he doesn't go willingly, then yes, he can be deported forcefully, like any other illegal immigrant.

My question:

If he was here for 10 years already, how has he not become a naturalised British citizen? Or at least got permanent residence?",0,1372259526,null,0,false,0,caqlzi0,t3_1h3x3j,t1_caqlzi0,t3_1h3x3j,null,1430676784,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,WheresMyDragons,swans2002,Swansea Born &amp; Bred,"[SwansFC](https://twitter.com/swansfc) - Independent Swansea account that mainly posts links to articles related to us.  Good game updates during the season also.

[The Swansea Way](https://twitter.com/TheSwanseaWay) - They write a blog that's worth reading, also post articles etc.

[Swansea City FC](https://twitter.com/SwansOfficial) - Not forgetting of course, our official Twitter account.

[Leigh Dineen](https://twitter.com/leighdineen) - Leigh Dineen is Swansea's vice chairman and uses twitter a lot.  He answers a lot of fans questions and sometimes breaks Swansea news first.  Well worth the follow for any Swansea fan.

[Chris Wathan](https://twitter.com/ChrisWathan) - Chris is a football correspondent for a couple of Welsh newspapers.  Handy to follow especially this time of year as he'll often be the first to link us to certain players.

[Phil Cadden](https://twitter.com/pjcadden) - Phil covers both Cardiff and Swansea, given that they're in the Premier League this year, you can probably expect a little more Cardiff news from him than before.  Cardiff fans are convinced he's biased towards us, but given the fact he's an open Man Utd fan, I've found his opinions to be quite fair.  He posts some great info for us.

[Matthew Phillips](https://twitter.com/matt_the_jack) - Okay, every Swansea fan should follow this guy.  He's a Swansea season ticket holder that never misses a home or away game.  His current record of consecutive games is in the hundreds.  He also follows Wales home and away, too.  His knowledge on Swansea is exceptional.  Has occasionally appeared on radio and local news to talk about the club.  Slowly making his way through all the stadiums in the UK, a true football fan.

(Overtly or otherwise, he says with a sinister ellipsis...)

If that's true, I suspect it's equally inevitable that there's a regular oscillation between controlling parties. And, therefore, that (unless we change our loyalties regularly) everyone will spend a good proportion of their time paying taxes to a government they didn't vote for. 

Going back to OP's question (sorry) it's a simple fact of our system that party politics, if it's not entirely artificially orchestrated, is going to be about maneuvering for power advantage, rather than debating issues or (heaven forbid) collaborating to develop good solutions to problems.

If it was any other industry that ruined people's lives or used illegal methods (eg phone tapping) or morally dubious practices (eg spitting on people so they react then using that photo image to further a story) then Government wouldn't hesitate to impose regulation. 

However, because ""the press must be free"" then certain elements within the industry can do whatever they like, knowing that the Government will hesitate to impose regulations that appear to curtail ""press freedom"". They can also use that Government fear to ignore the will of Parliament, which is obviously antidemocratic because Parliament is (in theory) the voice of the people.

Lib Dems don't us to renew trident which is why they'll never get my vote. Not updating trident leaves us open to direct invasion and people these days aren't different from the people in 1945.

Politics is genuinely boring. People who say 'politics is everything', are right in saying that but when politicians act in the belief of a political ideology, or people debate amongst themselves in accordance to where they sit on the political spectrum, this is something that DOES NOT RESONATE WITH THE COMMON MAN! 

I actually began to think a few months ago we should abolish the NHS as an organisation. We should not be hit by further inflation from borrowing, because everything gets more expensive and our quality of life genuinely suffers from that. I began to think that people should just look after themselves, probably because I spend too time much reading comments here I disagree with.

Then I changed my mind. Why should people die or not get treatment because of our finances being fucked at the moment? A citizens health is more important than their wealth, nobody should die because they can't afford healthcare. I don't give a fuck about anything anybody says in regard to this, people should not die because they're poor, end of.

But, and this is where I go into downvote alley, we should not provide anything to any other countries if it does not benefit the citizens of the UK. East Europeans are only as entitled to Indians to live here in my mind. They're both foreign countries but India has 1.5billion people, the UK only 65million. We cannot provide for everybody and putting your family, community, and country before others is not a wrong way to think. We're more culturally akin to the USA, Australia and Canada than we are to Poland. I feel closer to them, interact more on xbox live and in work with people from these places. 

Immigration is stupidly high and we should be more selective, able to decide who we want and who we don't, and able to draw up free trade with any country we want. We should be able to deport utter scumbags like Abu Hanza and stop being a fucking laughing stock of a country.

Business should be easier to conduct, EU laws are worrying for our financial sector and it is a precursor to a united states of Europe, which if we were a state under a federal government we would slash our quality of life, be reliant on the Euro and Germany bailing us out if theres another global crisis like in 2008.

This is why I support UKip, I'm not happy with the tories being too coward to change anything significantly and I'm not happy with labour who get nothing done! Lets increase our quality of life, defence forces, entrepreneurship and get people proud of the UK again!

Over 2,500,000 copies were printed, although the poster was distributed only in limited numbers, and never saw public display.[5]

The idea is that if a potential client sees our number on a website, in a phonebook, etc, then they won't immediately discount our services because of distance between us and them.

All our clients are corporations, not members of the public, and we don't make any money off people using the 0845 line or putting people on hold. We have very low volumes of traffic, with only two phone lines into the office, so even if we did charge for hold, we would never get the opportunity to make any money off of it.

Does it make any difference? Probably not, as our address is clearly visible in most places you'll find the number, in addition to our regular 01*** numbers, but the 0845 number is included in the business phone contract, so we might as well use it.

They make up the bulk of the changes over the last few years.

&gt;The rise of islam in the UK?

I guess a lot of these people entered as asylum seekers, because it is incredibly difficult to get entry to Britain. Or perhaps they got in with the old regulations which allowed Indians to move over, and then allowed family members to move as well.

For example, my girlfriend is Colombian and she can't even visit Britain without having to have an interview and pay a fair amount of money to get an entry visa - even just for a holiday. Meanwhile, even if we got married (which probably won't happen), immigration here would require me to earn over £19k post-tax (which I just about do), and me to visit Colombia, etc.

There is an argument to be made for convictions of the conspiracy to commit crimes, but this generally involves actual (provable) preparation to break the law rather than mere participation in an organised, legal protest.",0,1372268442,null,0,false,0,caqpfmf,t3_1h3bz1,t1_caqpfmf,t1_caqm925,null,1430675159,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"&gt;Eh? When was he ever known as a tactician? His previous teams were known for playing open, attacking football. Bullshit.

I am quoting the article. Did you even read it?

&gt;No he wasn't, he was playing as a nominal number 10 (as he had started doing the previous season under Di Matteo) with the front three rotating positions as time went on.

Mata started as a winger, Oscar played the middle. Mata drifted to the center, the same with Hazard. Except, Mata struggled tracking back, leaving the wings open. 

&gt;He barely rotated the squad because he knew that he was a dead man walking. 

Just an excuse. Maybe if he rotated his squad and not let them get burnt out, they might have won a game in a months span and there would be no reason to sack him.

&gt;&gt;The defense was a complete mess.
&gt;Agreed on this, it was shambolic. Marginally better under Benitez. Marginally.

Marginally? Under RDM Chelsea gave up 1.5 goals per game. Under Benitez 1 goal. And it's pretty hard not to give up a goal with the amount of dumb penalties they gave up. I would say a 33% improvement is huge.

&gt;&gt;David Luiz running around like a headless chicken.
&gt;Did you watch him in midfield under Benitez? Headless chicken. Zero tactical awareness, but he scored the occasional wonder goal, which must have meant that he played really well, yeah?

I'd rather have him running around like a headless chicken in the midfield, than as a CB. Under RDM, Luiz was on the way out as he was starting to get the labeled as being unpredictable. Benitez changed that. Oh, the reason why Luiz started to play in midfield is because Benitez had no choice. Romeu was injured and Mikel was with Nigeria for ACON. He literally had nobody to play with as a DM.

&gt;Azpi and Moses were brought in late on under Di Matteo - lest it be forgotten that they were both signed quite late. 

If he can start Oscar seemingly every game with the limited time he had, he can find time for azpi and moses. Under Benitez, Azpi started almost right away and moses finally got some game time. Are you telling me that RDM couldnt find room for azpi and moses for 2 months and yet Benitez could in less than a week?

&gt;No-one believes that Di Matteo was the answer for Chelsea. He wasn't. He wasn't good enough.

Are you serious? The amount of circle jerk RDM got made it seem like he was the second coming of jesus. 

&gt;That so many of you are willing to throw him under the bus and praise fucking Benitez to the hilt shows what pathetic, fickle wankers you are.

Who's throwing him under the bus? We are discussing an article that chronicles his managerial history with Chelsea. This article made it seem like he was unjustly sacked as he was doing a great job. This is clearly not true.

In other news here is the local council refusing to condemn the people who did the grafitti.

Shillings and two shillings, together with their same-sized 5p and 10p coin equivalents, co-existed in circulation as valid currency until the early 1990s. In theory this included coins dating back to 1816; in practice the oldest were dated 1947 when these values stopped containing silver. The coins were withdrawn when smaller 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 1990 and 1992 respectively.
The face value of Maundy money coins was maintained, effectively increasing all their face values by a factor of 2.4, as the coins continued to be legal tender as new pence.[12] The numismatic value of each coin, though, greatly exceeds face value.

A few years ago, I got home and i went downstairs to watch some tv, but my mom already was watching it. She was watching doctor who, and it was the episode ""The Shakespeare Code"". I don't remember what it was, but something intrigued me to continue watching it. I didn't watch another episode until a about a year later when I saw ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"". All of those episodes I really loved, even to this day, but for some reason I didn't get hooked. It wasn't until the episodes ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Day of the Moon"" were the episodes that finally brought me into the series. It took me a total of 4 years to convert me to the show,  but now i am a devoted fan to Doctor Who, including Classic Who. I've even watched the Doctor Who movie. I absolutely love the show, I can't wait to see the 50th (I trust Moffat to make it feel like it's celebrating the last 50 years of doctor who and looking ahead as well, even if no one from the classic era is coming back [though that does make me a little sad]. He was a fan of the classic who, so i trust him to do something spectacular and to give a huge nod to the classic.

Half the Lib Dems voted against the bill defyingthe instructions of their leader compared to no (or almost no) Conservatives who were all in favour of the bill. 

The Lib Dems agreed to officially support the policy and they deserve some retribution for that but the conclusion is not that the architects of the bill are better. Although this is a trite, Mark Corrigan-esque analogy, it's like saying the leaders of Vichy France are cowards for collaborating with the Nazis so  maybe Hitler will have a better knack for governing.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I'm wondering if the IPSO MORI data includes the the attitudes after the coalition took over. The figures all seem to stop at 2010. A rise in Tory support in and before 2010 is understandable given we were coming to the end of almost 2 decades of Labour leadership and were in the depths of an economic crisis blamed squarely on Labour by the Conservatives. I'm sure the reason young people began to associate with the Tories more after 2005 was because they saw Cameron as a bit more their generation. Compare him to Michael Howard or IDS or even William Hague Cameron is, by comparison, young and interesting...AND HE HAS HAIR! 

This was a huge change in image and I'm sure it played well with traditionally minded kids (or I should say kids of traditionally minded parents). You'd expect to see a jump in 2005 increasing steadily until 2010 and the student fees decision and then a drop in support broadly in line with the polling data for adults. Data post the election does not seem to be included however. 

In fact what the data does seem to show is that each generation moved away from the Pre-War generation's attitudes on welfare and politics like Gen Y is doing. The baby boomers did the same, Gen X did the same and Gen Y has done the same. In fact there seems to have been less of a difference between Gen Y and Gen X than between Gen X and the Boomers on the issue of welfare. There was a time in 2005/2006 when Gen Y was more generous in welfare than Gen X, something that has never happened before according to the graph. Given also that Gen Y is almost identical to the others (Pre-War is an exception) in terms of the NHS you could suggest that the move to the right has slowed with Gen Y from it's traditional rate. In terms of political parties, the report admits:

&gt;'Previous analysis suggests that as well as a generational effect, lifecycle effects may be important too, as it takes some time for political affiliation to “crystallise” among young adults.'

In other words young people don't have a party affiliation because they've been voting for a shorter time and have had less time to find a party they like. There have only been 5 elections since Gen Y started to vote (4 of which were won by Labour...admittedly New Labour but Labour nonetheless) and both parties have changed.

For clarity, I should have said something like ""As an adult man who *now* understands some of the intended and unintended innuendo in Doctor Who, and as a gay man who may not react to some of the more recent romantic angles as many heterosexual viewers do..."" but that felt like too much information.

I understand: I'm not part of the target male audience for Doctor Who. I don't get aroused by Leila in her loincloth outfit as many of my straight friends said they did in Classic Who. And though I can appreciate the beautiful romantic nature of the Doctor's relationship with Rose and the Pond's relationship. I am not brought to tears in the same way some of my straight friends are; I agree though that both of those plot lines are powerfully written and supremely well performed.

So not being part of the target audience, I do not find myself being able to literally feel a part of those romantic plot lines as I could in a show like Six Feet Under or a movie like Brokeback Mountain. That's not to put down what Doctor Who has done (Captain Jack is a great personality to have around, but he's not going to have a relationship on the show). Doctor Who is just not a show that can be all things to all people. No problem; I appreciate it for what it is and don't consider it any kind of failure that there isn't a gay Doctor or something.

But why'd I mention ""gay"" at all? Because I do think if I were heterosexual, I'd have picked David Tenant as my favorite Doctor. He'd be the one I would most ""put myself in the shoes of"". I love his acting, but it is Eccleston's take on the character that I really feel like I ""get"" from inside out. I just wish his run on the show were longer, but I'm glad I have what's there.

He can score essentially any type of goal, and can create chances for himself.

His play for Uruguay (including his current run in the Confederations Cup) is not a great representation of his usual play, as the presence of Forlan and Cavani means he's often shifted out to the left. In addition, the service for the Uruguay midfield is pretty awful. Taking these two facts together, it's not surprising that he scores less for the national team.

""Ok they spend a good proportion of time doing both.

But like I said, the episodes that are aired on TV are just a fraction of what adventures the TARDIS trio go through, many more get written in official books, comics, and audio, or those that aren't mentioned at all, so that means their have probably been many more months/years of dropping on and off.""

Also in The Hungry Earth (series 5) we see Amy and Rory waving at their future selves in the year 2020, there's no reason why this event no longer happens, so I think it's safe to assume it is around the year 2020 before they get zapped back.",0,1372279696,null,0,false,0,caqu1rk,t3_1h33a0,t1_caqu1rk,t1_caqk3g6,null,1430672911,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Look at the tax you pay then look at the billions spunked on cross rail, the military the NHS, the police, fire and education services provided.

Do you pay for that? How much tax must you pay!?

Theres not a a job here or there, there are tons of bus driver jobs in London, we have taken on 1300 in a year, network rail just had a recruitment event.

It is not a free class here or there, it is an absolute fuckton of money and resources. In this town the unemployed underclass can get their GCSEs in maths and english and IT free, then CLAIT and some microsoft shit, or an forklift truck license or their PTS, track induction and drug and alcohol test, FREE! That is a lot of money.

I have been to two job fairs in colchester town hall and the volunteer fair in the last 3 months and both times there have been an absurdly low number of people come in, despite the fact that the jobcentre next door is chock a block with the great unwashed getting their free cash, they didnt even bother their arse to pop their head in the door and get a free pen and a booklet on level crossing safety.

In what way are they superior to me? They dont participate in the community garden, or volunteer at the cat shelter or drive the elderly to coffee mornings or come to the free classes at the marriage centre, in fact everysingle person I know who volunteers or goes tonight classes is employed. Every single one.

Maybe they are just short of time.

If you are a student you get a the first 8 weeks for 50% off, if not the prices are still reasonable. You only pay for the weeks you actually use but you have to pay a certain amount up front. For example, I'll be using it for 4 months and 2 weeks, they charge per 4 weeks but in the end I'll get the 2 weeks I didn't use back. Once you check in you need to sign some forms and insurance/deposit forms and it's all pretty much settled. The boxes are individually alarmed. You need an access code to be able to call the elevator that takes you to the floor your boxes are on, this also disables the alarm, and then you still need your padlock key to actually open your box. They sell padlocks there, they're pretty cheap and really heavy-duty. Once you leave, you alarm your box again and it's all safe. For a 4,5 month period I'll probably end up paying about 250 pounds, pretty reasonable for a box big enough for a couple of big boxes, a bike and a lot more stuff. It's a 25 sqft one, but the ceiling is really quite high (2,5m? a bit more maybe).

We can't look at him as a player who's going to be coming in and contributing at that level right away - we'll be lucky if he develops into a player as good as a current Spain regular at all. He's coming in as a promising squad player, and relative to players like Juan Mata or Oscar, his price probably reflects roughly where he's' at at the moment. He's promising and clearly has talent, but I don't think any of us has seen enough of him even at Segunda level to really predict how well he'll do.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;Tax is essentially legalised theft

I hate seeing this bullshit statement everywhere (or at least on the internet). Theft implies dishonesty and an intention not to return the items stolen. If we gave money away and saw no money spend on publicly maintained areas, the roads were left broken, the bins were left uncollected, doctors were nowhere to be seen, the police didn't answer the phone, the army stood down, the parks overgrew, the roads and beaches and lakes grew dirty, trains stopped running, buses stopped working, teachers disappeared, then and only then do we come to theft. You get all that money back in a myriad of ways. It provides an efficient system in which you can live your life easily. It's not radical or unfair; it's how we've organised our countries for centuries. If paying your taxes makes you want to shoot people like it does Adele the I guess the idea of educating children, healing sick people or paying your parent's or grandparent's pension should do the same because that's where a shit tonne of tax money is spent. I can understand not wanting to pay defence money for an army but the majority of the budget is widely held to be a good idea. Why lament paying it then if what it's spent on is good stuff? Do you not want an educated, healthy, clean, safe country? I understand you yourself may not think this but I've had many a heated argument elsewhere with people who are adamant taxes are the devils work.  

Further to that you do not get 50% taken away unless your earning so much that most of your earnings come under the 50% bracket. The first 32,000 you make, whoever you are gets taxed at 20%, anything more up until 150,000 is taxed at 40%. Only the extra over 150,000 is taxed at the highest rate which is not 50% any more, the top rate is 45% from this tax year on. 

If you earn a £200,000 salary your actual effective rate is 42%. Remember bonuses are not included here. If your making £500,000 in your salary your effective rate is still 'only' 45%. That's a lot but only those making over half a million a year are actually paying an average of 45%, the highest rate, across their whole tax bill. 

[The calculator I used is here.](http://www.listentotaxman.com/index.php)

Besides, the idea that you own the money you pay in taxes in the first place is silly TBH. It's illegal not to give it and it's 'taken' before it's even in your possession. In reality it's just your employer paying a contribution to society in proportion to the money you earn. That's not really a political statement that's just what happens. It never really becomes your money in the first place as it's never in your possession nor is it owed to you contractually as only your post-tax salary is owed to you contractually. If you can show that your company values your work at your before tax salary then great but I think most companies are aware people pay tax and thus ensure their after tax pay is the value of their work. You earn your after tax pay not your taxes. Or at least that's one way of looking at it.
