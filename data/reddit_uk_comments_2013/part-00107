As it stands, your tax money is funding the policing of drug related acquisitive crime, of which there is a lot, and there is a good chance that you may have even been a direct victim. I would happily pay a few quid more on my taxes if it meant that I wouldn't be a victim of theft, especially if that was offset by a reduced need for policing.

The problem is that if someone doesn't want to quit, they won't quit. You can push them all you want, but you're just going to push them back to the black market if they don't actually want to quit. If they're buying on the black market then that means we're back to square one?

The most important thing we can do is to increase our ability to spy on these people so that they feel under threat and scared of what they say or do *at all times*.  This usually results in people abandoning what they currently believe and to follow whatever the newspapers and government tell them to believe.  

This should go hand in hand with racial/cultural profiling and anyone who slightly fits the bill should be treated as a dangerous, violent, irrational hate filled monster who at any moment will blow everyone around him to smithereens (as such armed police should do regular 'random' searches).  This provides reassurance that they are valued and trusted members of society.

The second most important thing we can do is to arm foreign ~~extremists~~ rebels and freedom fighters with our advanced military equipment so that they can fight and over throw the leaders/regimes of countries that aren't doing as their told any longer.  Failing that we'll have to invade and occupy those countries for a decade or so, making sure we cause as much chaos as possible initially, commit lots of atrocities to get them on our side and then invite all of our companies in to provide expertise (we'll have them paid a nice sum for their troubles of course).

You know you're right, we could have had a perfect season. That would have been lovely. Benitez could have won the league cup, fa cup, CWC europa league and secured second in the prem but that simply wasn't realistic. 

The CWC was disappointing but tbh it's only marginally more valuable than the super cup or the community shield, it's never been a big deal for European clubs. The league cup was disappointing, we lost due to two individual errors that were unfortunate and a very well organised Swansea side. The FA cup we knocked out United and then were beaten by City, who were simply the better team and deserved to win. Their squad is stronger than ours right now.

Only a few months ago our season was falling apart at the seams and now it has become a very positive one and yet you're barely satisfied. The truth is that we had a better season than 19 out of the 20 clubs in the Premier League and yet Chelsea fans like you somehow feel like we ""deserve"" more. Despite the fact that our squad, beyond the first 11 is actually the weakest it's been in years. 

You know that this is the reason that everyone hates Chelsea fans right? This deluded attitude that we have to win every single trophy every season. And even when we have a more successful season than everyone except Man Utd you're still not satisfied. 

Benitez came in and was BOOED by his own fans at home. Fans who'd rather make their stupid point known than actually SUPPORT their club. He had a fucking hard job and yes, he made some mistakes, and yes he made some strange decisions but, in the end, he got the results when it mattered and deserves a LOT of credit for it. 

All of this not even including the fact that I have already stated in my previous justification of my point that we played a 69 game season, possibly the longest, or certainly one of the longest, in premier league history and still peaked at the key part of the season.

Get real. We had a successful season, especially compared to the clubs around us and, however much you don't like the guy, we have Benitez to thank for it.",0,1369916746,null,0,false,0,ca8r4z7,t3_1ezsmh,t1_ca8r4z7,t1_ca7itoc,null,1430985530,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"There are more things to life than pure economics, it might be cheap and easy, but it doesn't automatically make it a good thing to do from a social point of view. As for the idea that if people don't want to quit then they won't quit, that is true. Which is why you need to have an easy path to quitting, one which is there to help people get clean and stay clean, plus help them rebuild their lives after this. But you also need to make it much harder to stay addicted to heroin, which is why you need to go after the illegal trade far more aggressively. 

&gt; Your argument seems to be a mix of you disagreeing because you don't like it, and you disagreeing because the public won't like it, but don't forget you are a member of the public. I presume you vote and to throw it out as a proposition because other people won't vote for it seems like a great way for society to never make any progress at all. 

I disagree purely because I think there should be a goal of getting people clean, not simply maintaining peoples addictions because it's cheaper. And I think a lot of people would also disagree because they would have problems with simply funding addiction rather than actively trying to reduce addiction. 

&gt; At one point a majority of the population supported slavery, but you better believe I'd have been in the booth voting against it whether 90% of other voters disagreed or not, because it was not a rational policy.

A common misconception. Had you been alive at the time you would have been brought up in an entirely different culture and would have held entirely different views on the subject of slavery. So while you think it's a bad thing now, a Borax who was born in Georgia around 1840 would have likely believed it was entirely moral.

true,ManusDei,lfc68,,"&gt;Rodgers hasn't proven himself in the market yet, as Borini and Allen have both flopped so far (relative to their price tags).

You don't think Sturridge and Coutinho have at the very least balanced this out?  I really think using the word ""flop"" in relation to those two is being way too harsh at this point in their careers. Allen certainly showed he can be worth his price tag early in the season. I agree he needs to do more and keep that form up, but the signs are definitely there.  Borini at the very least will put in all the work you could hope for and its not like his price tag was really all that high anyways (we aren't talking Carroll money here or anything even close).  Plus he was really unlucky with those injuries (as was Allen's that he was playing with for some time).

Coutinho (and i am genuinely not trying to use hyperbole here) could wind up being one of the biggest steals and best signings we have seen in a long time. He is making massive steps towards that status and he hasn't even had a full season yet.  His potential alone may make up for several transfer market overvaluations.

Of course, the government, UKIP, and certain newspapers will spin this story as 'EU wants us to pay bloody foreigns dole and give them our jobs', however this is much more about fairness.

Our wage structure has been based around getting benefits. In a lot of areas, minimum wage isn't enough to live on, meaning that people have to be subsidised by child benefits, or working tax credits in order to survive. 

Now, from the sounds of things, the government want to stop EU nationals claiming these things. This puts them at a distinct disadvantage to the local British population, whereas we wouldn't have a similar disadvantage in other EU countries. 

Of course, the government will fight this, and use the retoric I said early, so nobody wins in the case at the end of the day.

Well this certain seems to say that it's irrelevant and not a factor at all: 

&gt;Asking whether genetic traits could lead to certain socio-economic backgrounds, is like asking what the colour blue tastes like.

especially the part that says ""could lead"". If you recognize that genetic traits could tend to lead certain socio-economic levels, then yes I agree, you'll find that has always been my argument. It certainly hasn't been that genes *always* lead to certain socio-economic status, which would be completely nonsensical.

Which generalization would that be? or are you referring to someone else's arguments?  All of what I said refers to tendencies(both real or possible ones), which is hardly generalizing. Also, I said certain genes, which does not imply all of ""sub-Saharan Africans"", even if it would happen to be mostly or only held by them.

Chances of finding a player that's of similar quality to Suarez would be slim to none without being able to offer the Champion's League and to a lesser extent domestic league/cup trophy contention.

Although, I've been thinking about this a little bit.  Dzeko seems to be available.  He knows the EPL and he's got a great goalscoring record in England.  Watching him play for City, he's able to link up well with Silva/Nasri/Milner/Aguero quite well.

The American comedy sensibility doesn't produce the types of comedians that would do well in that scenario. usually if they're good at improvising, they won't be the most high-brow (think: a panel with 4 Johnny Vegases), or if they ARE smart and not so good at improvising, they'll appear as boring to the American audience. Smart folks like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Brian Williams, and Demetri Martin would make good panelists if they weren't so busy with what they already had going on. 

most likely it'd get picked up by PBS a la ""Downton"", and it'd have a format like WWDTM.

The role of Alan would likely be the most difficult to fill i think, because someone willing to step into such a self-deprecating role would be hard to find among the pool of recognizable talent. It's just not the American style.

Bullshit. There's little to no morality in most religions, and what there is is contradictory at best. Even if there was, religious ""morality"" is just deferring to authority without giving reason or logic behind the rules. ""It's bad because god says so!""

""I'm god and I love every one of you all unconditionally as my children, but I'm going to kill every last one of you motherfuckers in a global flood. Enjoy the swim!"" is hardly a good moral tale.

What happens when you base your morality on a religious framework, and those kids later go on to realise that all that god crap was a lie? Everything else taught in association with that religion loses credibility too. ""Well I was taught the only reason not to steal was because god would put me in hell, and there's no hell, so let's go looting!""

Its much less than I thought too, but of course the claimed figure is pretty much bollocks.

As for example I bet the figure was obtained by including the cost of buying the equipment (e.g a tank) and then it's operating cost, this is only valid if the tank is lost as a result of battle. as even without any war, soldiers and equipment are still required and paid for.

Calculating the actual cost is a nightmare and very complex, you can inflate or reduce the value almost at a whim depending on what you consider ""a cost"".

All it takes is a new submarine to be commissioned to replace an old one, in the timeframe of the war (10 years) and you can claim £1bn in costs for ""the war"", when actually without a war the cost would be exactly the same.

only quick an easy way of a general cost is ""total of battle losses"" and ""increase in duty"" expenses (i.e increased man power costs/payments)

&gt;CCTV helps massively in the resolving of crime. It helps identify the criminals, and sometimes is the only evidence available. It's a massively helpful too for the police.

Evidence?

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I despise this modern trend for arbitrarily spitting out cash numbers as if they mean something. Because, I mean, everybody in Britain knows £37bn is a lot of money right?... or is it.

£37bn for a war that lasted 12 years equates to 24% of the NHS budget for just 1 year, which in turn only represents about 7% of Government spending. Infact, of the £8 Trillion spent by out government during that 12 year period, the cost of the war in Afghanistan represents just 0.46% of all expenditure.

Put it another way, your average person paying 20% tax rate spends just 0.1p out of every £1 they earn towards the war in afghanistan.

**To be clear:** I'm not for a moment implying the war has been a financial sucess... I'm pointing out that arbitrarily casting figures to demonstrate the war in Afghanistan was wrong fails to prove anything.

If you want to evaluate the war for its financial sucess you have to ask the questions:

* Were the intended objectives accomplished - and were they worth the cost? (and this will still be hotly debated long after we are all dead and gone)
* Could the same have been achieved more cost effectively and if so, how? (this is a big question for the MOD at the moment about how they plan for and aquire equiptment)

If anything, the numbers I showed above probably demonstrate one thing... of all the merits and drawbacks of the war in Afghanistan, contrary to popular belief the cost is actually fairly inconsequential. If you want an example of a financially devastating war, you need only look back to the last 2 world wars. When troops pull out of Afghanistan at the end of next year, spare a thought for the people of Britain in 1945, who at the end of that war were so bankrupt they still had to endure another 9 years of food rationing.

That's why economies to this day rely so much on war and military just to achieve anything, and why the vast majority of inventions arised from a military desire. Especially in the US more than almost anywhere.

Now one would argue that this war economy is just welfare benefits for middle class suburban folk, but you'll never get the media or even the people admitting that. 

Let's all instead focus on that one guy who is cheating the system out of a few thousand quid, whilst the government, defence corporations, big banks and media rob us blind with billions.

And the grey?  I knew someone who moved there and within a week they found it soooo depressing"".  Well to me, 5 months of snow and ice and worrying about slipping or having a car accident is far, far worse than a bit of rain.

Altidore

Howard and Guzan are a toss up right now, no real idea who should be our number 1. 


Timmy Chandler finally got capped, but JK seems to like Cameron in the RB spot (I don't). Gonzalez seems to be entrenched as our CB of the future, but were still looking for who we will partner with him.  I have little idea who we plan on playing at left back. Beasley has been there a lot but he is 31. Fabian Johnson might be the plan, but he also seems to be a capable LM, which is my other question mark. 

Donovan is probably our best player, Klinsmann needs to get the fuck over himself and call him in. Zusi is alright, but not near where Donovan is. Bradley - Jones seems to be our best CM pairing, though Stu Holden should get a look once he's full fit.  Left mid is a mystery to me. EJ gets thrown out there a bit, Brek Shea looks to be on JK's good side, so it may end up being him. Fabian Johnson played there well for his club this year from what I hear, so if Beasley plays LB for the foreseeable future, we may see Johnson in the midfield. 

Dempsey is odd to place on a lineup. He's not a line leading striker, but he's not really an attacking mid. He plays that second striker type role, making late runs, dropping deep to get in involved, as all that shit. We need a good striker ahead of him, whether that ends up being Jozy, Herc, Boyd, or EJ.

It's really interesting and there are fantastic opportunities for travel, both for fieldwork and conferences, though the hours are long, and the pay is very poor given my level of qualification (pay and contract length are the only reasons that I would look to leave to be honest).

I had always been interested in sciences, so did biology, chemistry, maths and IT A-levels (my physics teacher was a dick so didn't want to pick that), and after a really awesome work experience placement in an agricultural lab, was MAFF at the time, then DEFRA, now something else), I decided that biological research was what I wanted to do.

I wasn't sure what branch I was really interested in so I did a straight biology degree (the first year is split evenly into microbiology, plants and animals), and decided that plants was what I liked best, so only did the minimum requirements of the other subjects and packed the rest of my course with plant modules. During the summers in my degree I applied for summer jobs at loads of different laboratories to build up my practical experience, and ending up working in a hospital pathology department (nothing to do with my interests but a good experience of how labs work). I worked my ass off in my degree and was actually able to publish some work, and finished with a first and started applying for PhDs - there are loads advertised on sites like findaphd.com, jobs.ac.uk and individual university websites.
     I took a 4 year funded PhD at a good university in my field (most PhDs are either 3 or 4 years of funding), and really enjoyed it. Worked hard, published more papers and was lucky to speak at a few conferences - at this level science rapidly becomes about networking and making connections. When I finished there was more work that we could do and my supervisor was keen to keep me on, but we didn't have funding for a full post-doctoral position, so I made the choice to stay on in a project that I really like but on less money than I could get elsewhere (typically 27-30K for young post-docs).

Beyond the academic qualifications, there's not too much to getting into this kind of work, just lots of hard work, keep publishing and speaking at conferences. The hours can be killer, but it's rewarding and mentally stimulating. If I had my choice again I'd probably go into engineering rather than science as the job prospects and pay are better, but we do at least get huge academic freedom to pursue our own challenges and interests.

For many subjects though (including many of the Physics courses I studied at university) the answer is obviously no.

My second piece of advice would be that if you haven't taken the optimal route so far, there is still ample time to adapt, learn and change. Do __not__ fall into the Sunk Cost Fallacy where you feel that because you've already invested a lot of time/resources into a thing you should continue doing it so as not to lose your 'investment'.

First point, definitely; second point, a bit, though it's harsh and smacks of victim blaming.

&gt;The UK voted no to a restructure of the voting system which would've provided better proportional representation not to mention a huge chunk of the population that can't even be arsed to vote. 

Speaking for myself: I don't vote, I won't endorse a corrupt system, it's not remotely a question of apathy.  Although I no longer live in the UK I'm still politically active there by proxy, and there are far more effective ways to change society than to vote.  AV was a shit alternative voting system.  I could possibly have seen some merit in supporting PR, albeit all forms of representative democracy are broken, added to which focussing on political democracy whilst completely ignoring economic democracy is total bullshit.  Most people spend most of their lives serving as minions, serfs at best - slaves at worst, in utterly autocratic dictatorships (corporations).

&gt;Therefore if you were a muslim militant looking for someone to convict as the perpetrators of crime in the middle east you could well argue the UK public are valid targets.

I take the point, I don't agree, though there are apologists for our governments who probably _do_ come close to being legitimate targets for those inclined to follow the path of violence.

&gt;Corporations are allowed to reign corruption because our elected officials are happy to take ""lobbyists"" (corruption) money. These are people we elect into power. 

Agreed, although again I think there's a bit of victim blaming here.

I'm looking to buy a house (well, a masionette/flat) at the end of my current tenancy around this time next year, hopefully using the governments new 5% mortgage deposit scheme.

After 8 years of university I've got about £50K of debt split between student loans and professional training loans from commercial banks. However, salaries in medicine rise very quickly, so next year my take home should be closer to £40-45K and for the 3 years after that about £50-55K. 

Consultancy usually takes about 10-15 years to reach. The minimum salary for a consultant is £74K and most earn between £75 and £100K. I'd say this is about fair for the work involved - it's selfless hard effort through school and then university, followed by long hours and anti-social shifts on the job, in an emotionally intense working enviornment.

My mortgage is £755 per month, and I overpay the maximum of £500 per month, which means I spend £1255 a month on the mortgage. Overpaying means I get to pay the mortgage off early, plus it counts as an insurance policy if something went wrong, meaning I can use the money in the ""bank"" to stop paying the mortgage for a while. I currently have overpayed by £5000 in the first 10 months (wasn't allowed to overpay in the first month of the mortgage).

While that sounds good, I'm supporting my gf and our daughter, and the gf earns only £9k a year, so as a household we're only on around the £50k mark. 

My plan is to overpay for at least another 2 years, by which point we will have around 26% equity in the property, and then I'm going to try to remortgage at a lower interest rate.

Overpaying like this means we have knocked off 4 years of the mortgage in the first 11 months of paying it, so we're on the right track.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The term ""choosing"" is important here. Drugs like heroin and methamphetamine are highly addictive, and remove the users ability to choose over time, where as things like MDMA or cannabis don't have that same addictive quality. Even alcohol is quite addictive. So any rational drugs policy reform would have to take this into account. And I don't think it should be the first option either, you should be given multiple chances to work with health professionals and support groups to overcome your addiction, but ultimately there is a point where sectioning an addict would be a rational and moral thing to do, especially if you were unable to take care of yourself, you were involved in crime or you neglected responsibility towards your family. 

So I don't think it's going to drive people to the black market if there are easily accessible and properly funded treatment programs which include shooting galleries and medical heroin, which will help you overcome your addiction, help you rebuild your life and won't leave you stigmatized by a criminal record.  But that isn't going to work for everyone and in some cases sectioning might well be the best choice. 

I think where we differ is that you hold the view that everyone will take the rational choice if it's on offer to them, where as I hold the view that in some cases people are not capable of taking rational choices when it comes to addiction, and that in these cases the best option is to walk the person to the correct choice even if it's against their will. We have a precedent in place for this when people have mental health issues that leave them unable to opt into treatment and I take the view that suffering from a self-inflicted crystal meth addiction is no different to suffering from schizophrenia.

Yes, absolutely - seems the OP has no problem going where she wants to, but when it comes to a DHS assessment, that's suddenly ""destroying all the progress she's made"".

Seems like an excuse more than a valid reason.

&gt; worrying whether the assessor is going to be some ignorant cunt with views like yours

You mean asking awkward questions like how can an agoraphobic depressive manage quite well in a restaurant full of people, but can't manage a 1-on-1 interview ? Those kind of cunt questions ?

You see, here's the thing. People with these conditions are not in a constant state ... there are good times and bad times. You've said it yourself. But seemingly anyone daring to ASK if they are in a good place or a bad place are blamed for ASKING !

It's like asking anyone how they are feeling, and getting the response ""Well I *was* fine, but since you asked I'm feeling fucking terrible"". It's nonsense. If you are getting help for a specific condition, and then apparently that condition ONLY manifests itself when challenged ... no-one couldn't be blamed for being suspicious.

You are not entitled to a free-ride for life, you are entitled to help IF you need it. And in that case, continued assessments to see if you STILL need help are perfectly reasonable. And it's hardly onerous ... no one is being asked to report every day, it's ONCE in 4 months ffs.

          Howard/Guzan

Chandler - Gonzalez - ? - Johnson

           Bradley - ?

Donovan/Zusi - Stu Holden - Dempsey
 
            Altidore

Howard is still number 1, but Guzan has been making a pretty good argument for himself.  I'd be happy with either of them in goal.

I've been impressed with Besler's few performances and he seems pretty good next to Gonzo, but I haven't seen him play other than for the national team.  I'm not sold on Goodson, he is usually decent but makes big mistakes.  Cameron did well at CB too, he definitely shouldn't be on the right.  I dream of an alternate reality where our U20 coach didn't piss off Subotic and he still plays for us.

I wish Cherundolo were a little younger because he has always been fantastic for us.  He is still chugging away but he is 34 and will inevitably start to decline.  Chandler still needs to prove himself, especially after being so flaky, but I'm not sure there is a better option on the right.

DM is a tough one.  Jones seems to have locked the position down, but I really don't like him.  He gets way too many cards and makes stupid decisions with the ball.  Danny Williams looked good when he was the only DM (Jurgen has a habit of playing 3 at once).  I hope Beckershit never puts on a USMNT shirt again.  Cameron could probably do very well in that spot.

Bradley needs to be in the team, nothing else to say.

Donovan is still better than Zusi, but Zusi is the future.  Amazing on set pieces, which for us is huge since we usually don't get many chances.  Zusi is more of a traditional winger who puts in some great crosses.  Good to have opposite of Dempsey who likes to drift inside.  Johnson behind Dempsey is nice to keep the width since he is so good going forward.

Holden probably shouldn't be in that lineup yet, but I can't resist.  I think a lot of people talk him up too much (almost making him seem like the one piece that will let the US win a World Cup), but if he can return to his pre injury form he's one of our best.  We've been missing a good creative spark in the midfield, and he can provide that.

I love Altidore, I think he is going to turn out very well for us.  Its a shame he had so many appearances when he wasn't playing for a club because it has turned a lot of people against him.  It has also made his stats look pretty terrible, with 13 goals in 50 some appearances.  If he doesn't start scoring people are going to call for his head, but if Jurgen is patient with him (and if the team around him can start creating chances) he will be fantastic.",0,1369927658,null,0,false,0,ca8u6vu,t3_1faxhl,t1_ca8u6vu,t1_ca8nhlh,null,1430984092,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Management responsibility 3 years

Deputy headteacher 4 years

Headteacher seems like forever...


Find out you enjoy the job first, that you're good at it. Then see if you can remain good enough to do it and have the capacity to take on extra duties. THEN look for management positions. There are more middle leadership positions in secondary and they pay better than primary but fewer opportunities for headships.

Don't get promotions for money - the extra hours/stress, etc is not worth the extra cash alone. Do it to increase your influence, because by making others better at their jobs there is a greater net gain for children.

The amount of 'written' work is less than a teacher. I rarely take work home to complete. The amount of 'thinking' work is increased massively. You *never* switch off. Many nights you will lie awake trying to solve an issue in your mind. The book stops with you as a head and so every decision you make must be the right one. Nobody comes and asks the headteacher for his opinion on menial things - only the important ones (important to them at least).

Also, on thevday you become a headteacher you suddenly have to think about the friends you hang out with, the clothes you wear (all the time) the jokes you tell, even the jokes you *hear*. You're in the public eye and ridiculous as it seems, some (sad) people watch your every move, listen to every comment and cannot wait for you to slip up.

Google Translation from Spanish:

&gt; The French writer Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac fun should be remembered as author of science fiction stories and perhaps also as prophet.

&gt; His two novels about travel to the Moon and the Sun (which are printed in the same volume) were published posthumously in 1656 and 1662, respectively. In them, a few years after Galileo recanted before the Inquisition, Cyrano describing the orbit of the Earth and other planets around the Sun and the weak gravitational field of the Moon , and proposed, occurring seven interplanetary travel methods, that of the rocket propulsion . He also claimed, three hundred years before Erich von Daniken , the gods and mythological creatures that abound in the history of the Earth are actually space travelers abroad, in this case people of the Moon (although originating from the Sun) that could change shape at will.",0,1369929875,null,0,false,0,ca8uzi4,t3_1fc4g8,t1_ca8uzi4,t3_1fc4g8,null,1430983717,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3
true,http440,null,null,"Yes, but the way all social care is paid in the UK comes down to government policy unless you are very wealthy. Now when you are at the point when you need the support of someone like me to ensure that you are fed, have drinks, entertained and kept clean and dry how much do you want that person to be earing? 

There is a direct correlation with quality of care and how much it costs, for example if you have soiled yourself and need help with getting clean to treat a person with respect, dignity and (as I always do) gently means it takes longer than roughly rubbing them over with a damp cloth whilst you chat about what you did last night to your mate. 

That extra time means that you need more staff and thus a higher running cost for your unit/ward/home so how much the government budgets for services like mine and my wages is directly comparable to the quality of care that you, as a consumer, will receive.

* FY2 basic is £28K, take home is ~£30-38K
* CT1-CT2 basic is £30K, take home ~£30-45K
* ST3-ST7 basic is around £35-40K, take home ~£35-60K
* Consultant basic is £74K, take home can be anywhere from £74-100K, with awards that can bolt it up higher usually late on in their career.

Junior grades can't really 'locum' in the true sense of the word (and most would struggle to find free hours to squeeze in extra shifts) but they can do additional bank work if they find the time to increase pay. Specialist grades can locum and depending on speciality this can be a significant money earner. FY1 and FY2 doctors may also complete a legal document called a cremation certificate (filled out when someone dies in hospital and the family want a cremation) for which they get about £80 each time - it depends on their speciality and the area,  but around ~10 cremation certificates over the course of a year is probably pretty normal.

Australia (ya know, the country that got the no.1 spot for almost everything in the 2013 OECD life index  http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/55555555555) has a mandatory voting system. Whereby everyone at voting age has to vote. 

Jullian Gillard makes the case for compulsory voting (essentially if there is voter apathy elections then become reliant on highly active vocal minorities that don't necessarily have the best interests of everyone at heart). I genuinely think we wouldn't have a conservative government if compulsory voting was in the UK. 

&gt;Compulsory voting has helped Australia remain out of the hands of ""small highly motivated minorities"" and should never be undermined according to Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

&gt;IN an exclusive interview with the Inner West Courier  Ms Gillard was asked by the Burwood Youth Advisory Group, through the Courier, if she would consider lowering the age of voting to 16.

&gt;She said if the voting age was lowered, it would have to be on a compulsory voting basis.

&gt;""I know there are some who say you could have a kind of opt-in arrangement for young people, so if you're interested in politics, if you're between 16 and 18 you could vote if you chose to- I don't agree with that,"" Ms Gillard said.

&gt;In her response Ms Gillard made reference to the voluntary voting system in place in the United States and how it had blocked ``rational'' gun laws from being put in place.

""?Compulsory voting is a precious, precious thing and it makes our politics, the politics of the mainstream,"" Ms Gillard said.

?""If you ask yourself the question how come? Well in the US they can't have rational gun laws, a big explanation of that is voluntary voting where small highly motivated minorities can distort a whole political debate,"" she said.

?She made note of former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard's 1996 gun control reforms.

&gt;""The reason we have good gun laws here, Prime Minister Howard showed a lot of guts no doubt about that, but our politics is about the politics of the mainstream and we should never do anything that undermines that.""

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Damn, I forgot to add the footnote. If you argue that it is not a choice (which the government currently does) then surely you cannot blame them for being addicted and it is therefore quite reasonable to prescribe heroin?

I don't disagree with prescribing heroin, where I would disagree is if this is just given to them, I would only allow the prescription of heroin as part of a managed program designed to get the addict clean.

&gt; Why would anyone sign up to a program which could well end up with them being sectioned?

The aim is not to section people who sign up and stick with the program, the aim is to section people who refuse to sign up or who cannot rationally make the choice themselves.

&gt; I do agree that addicts will not simply make the rational choice, but my issue is that humans will be in charge and humans are very fallible. Who gets to draw the lines and where will they get drawn? 

Who get's to draw the lines anywhere if you take that view? Who get's to decide if it was rape or it was murder? It's our society, we get to make the rules. They might not be perfect but that is why we don't set them in stone, and we allow them to be revised, modified, repealed or strengthened as we see fit.

&gt; Can I be sectioned because I don't want to ""get clean"" from amphetamine?

Something I'll point out is that you'll get a ton of different answers from many people as to the ""best languages to learn"".

Me, I decided to look at what jobs around my area required. Almost *all* of them, wanted C#. So that is what I went with. There is absolutely no point, at least in the beginning, in dealing and learning a language that is not used by any companies in your area. You would spend all your time with that language and cannot use it in the commercial world. Almost *all* of them used SQL Server, and nowadays a lot in my area are requiring SQL Azure and Azure-based experience. So I went for that.

I was originally told by a number of people to go for something like Python or Ruby - what's the use when no company seems to use it? Once I have a job yeah, why not, it's another language to learn, but the point is to get a job to begin with!

I'll also point out that I would be able to earn more if I moved jobs. Having been in this job since 18, I can see that jobs with bigger companies give more salary, but that is not the only thing I'm after.

This was my first programming job, and I did not try and go for the bigger companies. I went for startups. Why? They want labour as cheap as possible. They want someone who can do the job, obviously, but they want someone within their budget. Remember they are burning investor money, they want good value for their money. They wanted developers at cheap prices. I wanted experience to put on my CV.

This company is also in an easy location for me. I could go get a job with someone else with more money, but they'd be the other side of Bristol. I'd spend the extra cash I earn each month just getting to the damn place.

Money, is only one part of the job. I also love the culture of a startup. No shirts and ties and deadlines. Very relaxed. It has worked out quite well. I get along with everyone here really well, so why bother?

How I approached it programming? I got a GoogleCode account and made some projects. It was public, it was a way that potential employers can see my code that I write. I made tools that I never really used. However, the point is not whether you ""finish"" a project or how ""far"" you get with it, but it's more your coding style. If they can see that you coded some awesome API, it helps. It *really* helps.

I want to also say that people with a CS degree are also not guaranteed to get a job, but these are the type of people you are up against. So to win the edge, you need to have a portfolio. You will find a lot of uni students *don't* have this, or at least have obscure uni projects.

Think of some hobby projects. Even just replicating a software you use already. I use Evernote heavily. However, as part of a hobby I made a clone. It doesn't need to be pretty, but it needs to be functional.

As for how long - hard to say, unless you can devote some time to it, you only do it when you get a chance and free time. However, I started 'learning' C# in my free time between college. Considering you try to balance college, going out, friends, family, girlfriends etc, it took some real effort to fit in a tutorial or so.",0,1369931619,null,0,false,0,ca8vm6s,t3_1fbxzd,t1_ca8vm6s,t1_ca8uu8j,null,1430983420,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Once you get a cycle of ugly going, there's no easy way of breaking out of it. Ugly women, nobody wants to fuck them, hence they get stuck with ugly men, and the two produce even uglier kids, who in turn repeat the cycle. Alas, England. 

This is why you guys loved Princess Dianna so much, she was pretty, even by our standards. She was like a big shiny diamond in a big heap of coal. You could all live vicariously through her loveliness. Even though she married that inbred, melon headed derp, she helped out by producing some kids that you didn't have to tie steaks around their necks to get even the dogs to play with them.

After looking at the research cited (Doran &amp; Zimmerman 2009), you are right to say that the 97% figure is a bit misleading. It's not 97% of climate scientists, it's 97% of *climatologists who are active researchers on climate change*. The figure for all active climate scientists looks to be closer to 90-92%. The figure you quote of ""1 in 5 disagree"", I'm assuming refers to the 82% agreement when you include non-publishers and non-climate scientists (including geologists, paleontologists, hydrologists, etc). You're wrong to suggest this means 1 in 5 disagree, though, as a large portion of those not agreeing will have answered ""Don't know"", indicating their not being experts in the subject.

You can take issue with the fact that the 97% figure is based on only 77 respondants, but the fact of the matter is that those 77 are the most expert in this particular field.

I agree that it's a fairly poor study though and a small survey like this doesn't really provide much more than a nice soundbite. Better evidence comes from the [Oreskes (2004)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686.full) study which analysed every paper published on climate change between 1993 and 2003 and showed that not a single paper rejected the position that global warming is man caused. 75% of the papers agreed with the man-caused position while 25% made no comment either way.",0,1369932960,null,0,false,0,ca8w45o,t3_1fa4de,t1_ca8w45o,t1_ca8hu34,null,1430983185,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Besides which, you're arguing the semantics of what can be considered ""employment"" and ""pay"" and employing a blanket statement of feudalist structure? Strawman much?

And I think the lady doth protest too much. Check out the Reed website sometime. It tells you how many people applied for every single job. Seriously, go do it. I'll wait.



Done it? No? Go fucking do it then!

Since I doubt you will, spoiler alert, regular bottom-rung jobs tend to go for a couple hundred applicants apiece. This system at the very least gives people the chance to prove that they can work. It forces the employer to see them as people, rather than just names on a .doc file. You can wax lyrical about how nobody should do what you think they shouldn't all you like, its easier to convince an employer to hire you if you are seen to be capable of working well. That's the entire basis of the ""its easier to find work when you have a job"" logic.

And there IS a ritual you need to go through to be worth being paid for your time. That ritual is called work. You cannot expect payment without work. You cannot demand payment for work you have not done. I wish you'd stop acting like the world owes you a fucking wage purely because you think you're all that. If you're willing to find someone to pay you now for work you'll do later (or never) then more power to you, but the rest of us mere mortals have to do something called ""earn"" our pay. That means time, effort, energy, sweat, dedication, attention to detail and elbow grease per work day or per paid hour. We are entitled to nothing. We earn everything. If you are unprepared to accept such a trade of energy and effort for money then I will gladly help you find a bridge to live under, because there's no way you can seriously hold this philosophy AND any kind of gainful employment. You are paid at the end of the month for the work you have done during that month. This is evidenced by the dates on your paychecks. You are not paid at the end of the month for the work you will do over the course of the next month, or every paycheck ever would be pre-dated by one month.",0,1369933155,null,0,false,0,ca8w6rr,t3_1f9ayq,t1_ca8w6rr,t1_ca8p5o4,null,1430983151,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

* Stokes Croft - probably the hippest place to live now, though half of it is still a shithole, and the other half full of wankers who came because the Independent's style section told them to. Still, a good night out.

* Jamaica Street / Dove Street - a hole plugged with council flats. Includes the homeless shelter where the drunks shack up, and a relative hotspot for crime.

* St. Paul's - not for the naive, but probably not as dangerous as people think it is. Cheap housing and pretty central, at least.

* Picton Street / Montpellier - cheap, full of hippies and dub music. More Stokes Crofty than Stokes Croft these days.

* Cotham - up the hill to the west, and a very nice place too. Great views over the city, nice Victorian and Georgian houses, pretty pricey for rent.

* St. Andrew's - on the hills to the east, also very nice. More of a family area close to the park (lovely park, especially in the summer), but lots of student lets too. Pretty cramped for parking though.

* Ashley Down - next to St. Andrew's, with slightly cheaper rent, some newer housing, and generally easier to park. Centred around the City of Bristol college campus, so lots of students.

* Bishopston - around the part of Glos Rd where the independent shops are. Not sure what the rent is like, but with the location probably quite high.

* Redland - west of Bishopston, on the way to Clifton. Something halfway between the two in style, some very nice and expensive property.

* Horfield - has Southmead hospital and the Horfield leisure centre. Fairly cheap housing for a bit further out of the city (with the mainline down Glos Rd).

* Filton - to the north-east of Glos Rd, which turns into Filton Rd as you go north. Newer and cheaper 1930s housing, not a terrible area but a bit boring.

Same way drug addicts are often found now. The police will pick up people for other crimes and identify that they have a substance abuse issue. At this stage every effort would be made to get them into a treatment program. If you look at how people are sectioned for mental health problems they can have a 72hr hold put on them, which for an addict would be used to get them into contact with health workers who can asses and advise, rather than being release on bail and expecting social services to figure out the rest. This means that a heroin addict who is arrested for shop lifting is immediately put into the care of medial professionals and the whole process of getting them clean can start hours after their arrest, rather than at some vague point in the future. 

And you would also need walk in centers and GP's for everyone else, so everyone would be very clear on what is on offer.

&gt; It's a bit different with drugs though, because there are a lot of people in power who believe all drugs are fatally dangerous, addictive and immoral. Just look at our current laws. Shrooms are Class A and methamphetamine is Class B.

No.

&gt; to the revival efforts of Russell T. Davies

OK...so you like RTD:

&gt;Now, he is two-dimensional, detached, violent, and has even been seen committing premeditated murder for the sake of revenge. 

So RTD's idea of him killing ALL OF HIS KIND is perfectly OK with you? I'm assuming this ""premeditated murder"" was the murder of Solomon the Trader? All I can say is...1)NOT written by Moffat. 2)He was a disturbing character that had murdered thousands of people, and the Doctor still gave him a chance. What was it that 10 said under RTD? ""No Second Chances."" right before he murdered the Sycorax leader. I don't see how this murder was for revenge. Nor do I see how, despite this single thing, he changed that much.

He just had to get rid of the Time Lords again from the RTD era. We could liken him to 9 in Dalek.

And being violent? Has this guy EVER seen Classic? Because #3 karate-chopping through guards isn't violent at all.

&gt;-The presentation of female characters on the show has raised serious concerns among feminists and women in general. Many feelings have been hurt. **Thousands of women have spoken up to express their upset, and Steven Moffat has dismissed them very rudely in the public sphere.**

Proof of this? Source?

&gt;-Excessive liberties have been taken with the Doctor Who universe and its continuity, to the point of dramatically rewriting both Classic Who and the Russell T. Davies revival. 

So RTD decided it was a good idea to make it so that Gallifrey is destroyed and all the Time Lords are dead, and that's ok? What's the ""excessive liberty"" with continuity that was taken?

&gt; fans feel that 

SOME fans. Or, pushing it, MOST fans. But don't assume you are speaking for ALL fans, because I find that insulting. No one speaks for me but me, or (at a stretch) an online poll that I have taken part in.

&gt;Fans feel that the show's overarching plots, which are under Moffat's direction, are convoluted, poorly written, and presented in a hamfisted way.

....This is opposed to over-arching plots such as 2 words that were randomly placed in each episode that took no effort at all to think of?

&gt;However, we urge the BBC not to mistake this commercial success for creative success.

If people do not like the show THAT much, they do not buy it. They do not rent it. They do not get BBC America. The fact that it is growing so much, must surely be something to consider.

Like SilentMobius, I find it annoying that people who are against a petition can vote.

Moffat is going to leave Doctor Who, just like every single producer before him. He's already said he's closer to the end than the start. What I see is a group of selfish spoilt people who can't be patient enough to let people who do enjoy it reach the end and Moffat to tidy up and finish all of his plot threads.

Within the next 3 years our household income should reach £100k.

Bought a small 2-bed house in 2007 for £172k (in a nice town).  Aiming to sell it for £175k and buy a £400k place next year.

But... we're pretty frugal.  Two kids (5 and 1) so not been abroad on holiday for 5 years.  We spent several years paying mortgage, medical school fees and full-time childcare (approx. £10k a year at nursery) on my £35k income so we learned to budget effectively.  One car which is ten years old (Renault Scenic).  No Sky, no iPads, TV is an old Sony 32"" CRT, basic mobile phone package, weekends camping rather than flying abroad.

Our spending patterns didn't change when my wife started working which is why we've saved a fair bit over the last 18 months.

Computer Science if a vague topic and covers a wide range of subjects. It depends on what sort of IT job your after. I know that there's demand for people with virtualization experience, as well network related topics, such as network administration, SAN engineers, and security engineers (i.e. firewalls). If you are looking at doing software development, then there a number of vacancies around, though competition for those spots is higher as your often competing with graduates. If you don't have that much experience in the industry, or find it difficult to get a job, then I would recommend jobs such as ""Application support engineer"" as a stepping stone. While these jobs don't require you to have a computer science degree it really does help if you do have one. Also an easy stepping stone is QA\tester jobs for software development firms, again, having that degree really helps.

With regards to accommodation, I pay £575 for a 3 bed house in Cwmbran, and house share with a mate. I wouldn't recommend the trains to Cardiff from here though, they are far too infrequent. You may want to consider Barry, which is quite close to Cardiff.

true,volar92,null,null,"Well,

When in the late 80's and the beginning of the 90's Belgium had an extremely good team (Well, good for a small country like us). In 1986 Belgium made it to the semi finals of the world cup. Which is our best result yet.

I wasn't even born back then. But people still speak of ""that golden era"". When I was a kid, I remember our last major tournament, the world cup in 2002. We played extremely well against Brazil (who would later win the tournament). But a refferee decided our goal was not given (Which was a faulty decision). After the tournament even Brazil said Belgium was their toughest opponent in the whole tournament.

Trivia: The guy who's goal against Brazil didn't count was Marc Wilmots, Our current coach. It is often said that he is going to Brazil to take revenge on Brazil ""It is written in the stars"" as they say.

After 2002 that generation slowly became older , and the newer generation just wasn't on the same level. Belgium quickly fell down on the rankings. We dropped from 16th until about 70th on the world ranking I think.

Meanwhile us Belgians couldn't really root for our team in major tournaments anymore, and there was a lot of negativity surrounding the national team. Everyone made jokes about how bad they were.

I remember rooting for Holland in 2010 because they are our neighbour country and we share the same language. But it just didn't feel the same. I have to admit we felt some jalousy for our neighbour country who made it to the finals of the world cup while we didn't even qualify.

Meanwhile in the 2009-2010 period, people started talking about a new ""golden generation"". Kompany made his transfer to Manchester City, Van Buyten played decently at Bayern Munich. In 2011 we hired a new coach. his job was to qualify us for the European Cup of 2012.

But unfortunatly, we didn't make it due to many rookie mistakes, giving away lots of points in the last minutes. To be fair, we were in a group with Germany, but even then, we should have gotten second place over turkey.

Once more a major tournament took place without the Belgians, but the belief started growing. Last summer Eden Hazard transfered to Chelsea. Courtois won the UEFA cup with Atletico. As you probably have noticed, this is a new, modern generation. One of the key factors of this success is extremely good youth scouting in Belgium and giving poor kids the chance to play football.

Benteke for example, grew up as a poor boy in Brussels.

The trainer who joined in 2011, promising to qualify us for the eurocup had failed. But everybody still loved him. Until now his biggest accomplishment is making the Belgians love their team again. Between 2006-2008 we played matches in near empty stadiums but thanks to the belief in our new generation the national team got hot again.

Unfortunately that trainer was spotted by a top club in Belgium. He joined them and left the national team. This was last year. The assistent trainer became our new trainer. Marc Wilmots. 

This guy LIVES for the national team. He used to be our captain in our older glory period. He is extremely passionate and very open with our players. He started building a team instead of individual top players. 

The real turning point was last summer. The first 2 matches under Marc Wilmots were average (lost 1-0 from England and equalized 2-2 against Montenegro i believe, those were friendlies).

But the most important thing was, people started caring again. We saw Hazard joining Chelsea, and our players making a big name for themselves in the Premier League. Then last august, we played a friendly against Holland.

For us Belgians, it's special to play against Holland, we were kinda jealous of their performance in the last years. But that night. Belgium won a game again. Even though it was just a friendly, it was the start of a positive momentum! It was also the debut of Christian Benteke for the belgians I believe.

The rest is history, we are playing quite well in our group now sharing the first place with Croatia, we only conceded one goal so far.

Most people that are not from Belgium consider us as ""the dark horse"", ""the giant that is waking up"". But we are very careful! Our main goal and dream is to qualify for Brazil. We know that not qualifying for Brazil might crush our dreams and hopes once again. This generation HAS to do it!

I love the fact that people all over the world know us now. I feel somewhat proud when I see a post about a Belgian player on the /r/soccer frontpage. We are a tiny country after all! Any support is welcome.

Anyway, this reply is probably way too long.. I guess I am somewhat passionate about our team ;)

Start by shifting blocks of code around, try and replicate other sites' layout by shifting elements.  Wordpress has a great community and documentation, which is why it's a great place to start working on CMSs.  I started with WP about six years ago, now I develop for Magento, ModX, Drupal and develop custom web apps.  ModX is a good second step.  Stay the fuck away from Magento and Drupal until you're confident with PHP.

Really, it isn't as difficult as it looks. There's a learning curve, of course, and it's a little daunting until you find the one tutoral that makes it all click into place for you.

There are a *lot* of books on the subject, but honestly I've never learned anything computer related from a book, it's just a ridiculous medium for the topic.  My advice is to play with the backend of it until you're comfortable with what it means by blocks, sidebars and so forth, and then try building a theme.

Also, the default themes it ships with, and off-the-shelf themes, are incredibly complicated because they have to support all features.  When you're developing a theme for one specific website, about 60% of features aren't used, so you don't have to support them.  What you end up with often doesn't look so different from a flat HTML file.  Of course, as you get better, you'll learn to use those features to do some pretty goddamn cool stuff, but that's what distinguishes a Wordpress developer from a *great* Wordpress developer.",0,1369936048,null,0,1369936262,0,ca8x9te,t3_1fbxzd,t1_ca8x9te,t1_ca8vrfo,null,1430982568,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So to me, while it's an emotional line for Tennant, it's a line that in many ways should be despicable for the Doctor to say - it's like the final nail in the coffin for 10, signalling the arrival of 11 as *absolutely necessary*.

It's different from prison in the same way that a secure unit or hospital where people who admitted by the courts under the Mental Health Act are sent is different from a prison. It is not a punitive corrections institute, it is a medical facility that specializes in substance abuse and addiction.

And just like the majority of people with mental health issues don't need to be put in a secure unit, the majority of people with substance abuse issues wouldn't need this type of treatment.

&gt; What you seem to be proposing is a form of decriminalisation of addictive drugs and regulation(?) of others, but with the jail we have now replaced with some sort of rehab-jail for repeat offenders?

Not entirely. Decriminalization combined with treating substance abuse and addiction as medical problems, and giving courts the ability to force people into treatment programs in a similar manner as they can currently force mentally ill people into treatment programs.

Daleks - Overplayed? Maybe. But they have gotten goofy - I'd love some truly twisted genocidal Daleks for a change.

Neil Gaiman can stay on writing. Also - where is the Steven Moffat who wrote Empty Child/DR Dances - Girl In The Fireplace - Blink etc...I want THAT guy writing again... And quit trying to hook the Doctor up with some tail - the dude is 1100+ yrs old and has had children, grandchildren etc - he doesn't NEED a love story to go along with everything else. His inaccessibility and alien-ness was part of the charm. 

I'd love to see The Doctor take on a male companion more in keeping with The Brigadier.  Rory kept getting shit on (and should have stayed on - sans Amy - oooh drama) - Jack is a little too loose - Craig Owens was a heftier Rory -

The Doctor needs a Man around for a bit who is stalwart, principled. Grim even. Would do some good to balance the too-much frivolity. 

Also - The Master is great and all - but I like where John Simm left the character - how about (drumroll) The Meddling Monk!!! 

The First Doctor sent him off in a randomly materializing TARDIS from season two (1964). A rumor flew around a couple yrs ago indicating Patrick Stewart might grace the show as a long lost and vehemently vengeful Monk. THAT would be awesome....

Also - I can't stand the control room interior - it looks like a carousel - and i just cant take it seriously. Those things on the walls look like targets at a carnival spray n play.

While going through security a gooner security agent(2 strikes) noticed my Spurs jacket and asked me if I started the rumor at WHL the day before.

I'm on £18.1K, which is **ok** for up North.

I actually quite like my job. I've helped a few well known journalists / TV presenters with their IT issues, so that's sometimes nice.

However, I really don't want to be there forever (in the same position, anyway).

I know C# .Net, but I'm self taught. My dream is to get in to a junior programming position. I'd switch for the same pay I'm on now, just to build up experience. It seems hard finding development positions that don't depend on other experience I don't have or technologies I don't know, or positions that will allow me to learn these things on the job.

All I want to do now is programming.

I rent, for £550 a month. For that me and my girlfriend get a 3 bedroom house, front and back gardens and a detached garage in a nice area.

We have virtually no savings. My girlfriend has more savings than me, but we keep our money separate, so that doesn't make any difference to myself.

I own a motorcycle on finance (after paying off my 125, I upgraded). Council tax, utility bills (particularly energy) are pretty high, so we don't have a huge amount to ourselves that isn't used on daily food / living costs such as petrol, lunch at work, etc.

It was luck that they had just reopened their old lab and wanted some ~~victims~~ eager young graduates to take it on.

The problem is that it's a bit of a niche area; jobs are few and far between. However, many people in this area are nearing retirement age so if you're still interested by the time you graduate, there's a good chance that companies will start recruiting. Actually, my company is currently recruiting for that very reason...

Topics that are useful for lightning are electromagnetism and basic electronics. Those are the two basic things you need, but having an appreciation for mechanics, stress, thermal physics and hydrodynamics will be useful in this area. If you have computer simulation skills, that's good too, but also doing practical stuff and having an appreciation for engineering is a good help. 

I'm not saying you need all this stuff, this is more of a flavour for the sorts of topics you might need to brush by. :)

keep an eye on the career parts of companies such as Airbus, BAE, EADS, AgustaWestland, QinetiQ, Cobham... Brain's failed me; i'm sure there's a bunch of others in the UK...

After reading many of the posts on this thread I know that some of the highest earners do roles that I have done in the past, in fact I think one may work in the same office I did a few years ago. 

I'm exceptional at what I do and I love it. I get offers for very well paid roles in a number of sectors all the time, I still write code and like creating websites and I get invites that people that work within the IT sector would give their left nut for.  I also have Email address that they would give the other one for, I apologise for any perceived misogyny please substitute ovaries if that is more appropriate. 

But money means very little to me and that is all working IT (or other sectors I have worked in) means to me, to me a good day is being the only person on the planet that can get a severally disabled person to eat and communicate, with several the people that I support I’m that only one in their lives that can ensure this. 
Another example of a good day for me is a day that people felt they could talk rather than harm themselves or the many that I have helped from poverty to employment (people with mental health problem face 80% unemployment in the UK).  

My society deems what I do has little to no value but it is the most complicated thing I have ever encountered and I love it, I’d love it more if I got paid a nice wage and could restructure the sector as it is a joke right now. But I’ll just be satisfied with the knowledge that I have had a positive impact on the lives of some of the most challenged people on the planet, very few people can honestly say that. 

But it is okay to pay me a very low wage as what I do isn’t important right?

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"Well, as per usual ibpants, I find myself agreeing with you on most of that. 

I'm a little apprehensive about brining in all of these older players from south america, but it could be a great way to sign some quality back up players for not a lot of money. 

I actually wouldn't mind getting Isco and Reus (if we could afford it) just because Isco plays primarily as a center attacking mid or a left midfielder, while Reus is better employed as part of the forward line, either as a winger or a center forward, which are both positions we could end up needing someone in for 4-3-3. Plus, we all saw the final, he's downright amazing.  

I'd add that I really hope to see Guidetti get some starts next year. Cavani will (if he comes) be an adequate replacement for both Tevez and Dzeko. He's got the skill and tenacity of the former, with the speed and height of the latter, but he can't play every game, nor can Aguero, and Guidetti's the only other option we have. It sounds like he's really got potential, and I could see him coming out of nowhere to become a tar player from us the same way Nasty has this year.

This is getting to be an expensive list, and we haven't even factored in a new defensive midfielder. We desperately need one, and I'm not convince Fernandinho is right for the Job. We've already got Toure in his role, and like you said, Rodewell is better back up for Yaya than he is for Barry. It's such a shame we couldn't sign Martinez last year, he would have been perfect. I doubt we'll be able to sign a player of that quality this year, especially if we intend to do a lot in the other areas mentioned, but I wouldn't mind buying a promising looking young player who could serve as Gaz Baz's understudy.

First *Backup*    
Barry *Garcia*  (Holding)  
Yaya *Rodwell* (Box to Box)

They've done a few good things (recent signings are good, transfer committee showing promise etc) but there are a few serious doubts I still have with them. 

The first is that I'm still not sure what their intentions are, it seems to me that they want to get us backing the top 4, get the planning permission for the stadium expansion and then sell the club. They've made it clear that they won't put their money in, so what are their plans to be succesful on the pitch whilst funding expansion? It seems like they have a new plan every season.

The second problem is Ian Ayre, although it looks like he's about to be replaced, he's Hicks &amp; Gilette's man that they've had in charge for too long, he's signed off bad transfers, rubs other clubs the wrong way and let being liverpool happen. 

Third, Ayre's been the only boardmember based in Liverpool, that breakdown in communication between him and the rest has lead to situations like last Augusts deadline day, which ruined our season.

I have many plans for freshers week to encourage straight allies to be involved with the association. I hope to increase the number of those who are know as not being LGBTQ and are heavily involved in the association. This will mean that someone who is unsure won't feel worried about outing themselves. It's not going to be easy to get more straight allies involved, but it's definitely worth a go. Something like cross-society events would be good.

One thing I find at the moment which isn't particularly welcoming, is the general meetings. We have a meeting each week but its far too formal. Most people don't say a thing, and it's not really an atmosphere conducive to introducing yourself to new people. I want to make meetings friendlier, and change the venue to somewhere a bit more chilled. I know one of the JCR's or societies has their meetings in county bar, but we have to provide a safe space. Somewhere like Pendle TV room could be good, its quite tucked away except for the people playing pool and it's not like we would have a massive rainbow arrow on the door. If people don't feel comfortable talking to those who have been through what they are scared of, they are going to struggle a lot trying to talk to someone without the knowledge base and personal experiences.

Also I will be working with the welfare officers in each college to be better at helping individuals who are questioning. (its very scary) I will be doing office hours and will be working hard to make myself as easy to contact anonymously and either talk online anonymously or privately face to face. People claim office hours don't work but in actual fact they do in a way, they advertise willingness to talk and help. I doubt people would stick to the assigned hours but I'm pretty flexible, it's important that people know that there is someone to talk to when they are ready.

I like my job, it has good prospects (first time I've been able to say this). In 6-7 years I should be on an above average wage (maybe not for someone over 40 but average overall for adults).

I work a few days in retail in my spare time which gives me some handy beer money but not much (don't do much extra work). I mostly do it cause I enjoy the change/job.

I do get a Pension but only just started it so by the time I retire I'll need something else to top it up (god knows what - savings?).

Some savings (towards house but only about £7k but constantly adding to it... slowly - I've always managed to save somehow). No debt beyond student loans.

I'm starting OU in Oct so wage isn't likely to rise any time soon and I'll do the retail work much less. I live in London but don't earn a London wage (job is out of LDN so travel costs loads - mostly petrol).

I'm partially reliant on my GFs wage to live and eat. Somewhat pathetic I think (should be able to stand on my own two feet). Luckily shes amazing and generous. If we split up I'd be seriously in debt very soon (and very upset!).

I don't expect many people to read this mini-novel, but for those of you that do, I tip my hat and I hope you find something interesting from the perspective of someone who's followed the owners for over a decade.

1) **FSG *will* spend money**. I feel like at times Liverpool fans have been nervous that Liverpool will become less and less attractive because FSG is stingy, but I'm telling you that this is not the case. They are simply very patient and will not spend if the price is not right. They will overspend on occasion if they are really in love with a player, they simply will not grossly overpay as we've seen with some bidding wars (even on a small scale with players like Vergard Forren a few months back).

Here's an example: about 3 years ago there was a bidding war for baseball player Mark Texiera, an all star 1st baseman. It was basically only the Red Sox and the Yankees (read: Manchester United) who could afford him, and the price got so high that Henry finally said, ""He's incredibly valuable, but this is too much and we will get the same quality for 2/3 the price next year.""

Sure enough, the next season Adrian Gonzalez emerged as just as good of a first baseman as Texiera, and the Red Sox were able to get him for a relative bargain since the Yankees had already filled the position for a hefty price the year before.

So FSG is very calculating and patient, but I want to reassure Liverpool fans that yes, John Henry is rich as hell and will absolutely spend when the time is right. He may not be Arab Oil rich, but I mean, last year he got injured [taking a tumble on his megayacht.](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/09/30/red-sox-owner-john-henry-injured-on-yacht/) 

**Be aware, however, that sometimes these buying strategies are multi-year plans, which really pay off but can be hard to swallow for fans who always want a quick fix.** But I absolutely assure you, FSG *wants* to spend enough money to compete at the top of the league. Mediocrity is completely unacceptable in the long run for them.


2) As you've seen this year, FSG is **obsessed with youth** and spotting talent very early. This can sometimes be a fault, because they'll give long contracts to young talent which doesn't always pan out. This pays off when you strike gold, because now you have the player in your pocket, but sometimes they overvalue players before they're proven.

However, it's not a youth *only* policy as I've seen thrown around in discussions here sometimes. They do have a sense of locker room chemistry and balancing energy with experience. I think we'll see some of that in this long transfer window. My wet dream is that they're secretly positioning for Alonso's glorious return to Anfield, but there's been no mention of it and his position is not an immediate need, so I'm trying to not get my hopes up.

3) At the same time, FSG is determined to **keep the talent they have** and **pay extra to make sure club icons don't retire anywhere else.** I've seen this year after year at the Red Sox. They will pay a beloved player more than he is worth to stay. They are *very* aware of a team's brand and which players fans are paying good money to see play and buy kits for. I actually also think this international brand factor leads FSG to favor international players in new marktets when evaluating two similar players. However, they like to have a core ""hometown"" player base. In other words Scouser player &gt; international talent &gt; random white footballer when evaluating talent. You will never see Liverpool do what QPR did this year.

On this note, FSG also is very hesitant to sell talent to rivals. When they do unload an expensive player, it is only because they think he is being massively over-evaluated by everyone else, and if they do decide to dump an expensive player, it is almost never to a competitor in the league unless they really think they're handing them a dud. 

I want to emphasize, however, that **FSG's first reaction is to always keep the talent you have**. For example, if they value Suarez at 45 mil, they will not let him go for 50.

4) **FSG is very stat-oriented.** They brought a lot of innovation to baseball by looking at new ways to evaluate a player's impact on both sides of the ball.

I actually believe that football has some work to do in this regard. Scoring is so difficult - it either takes a string of brilliant play or a massive error - that it's hard to just look at goals as a measure of a player's worth. You've seen clubs start to really value ""chances created"" and other such metrics, and I think FSG will continue to innovate here and spot talent where others don't. We can already see how wrong Chelsea was about Sturridge and how wrong Inter was about Coutinho's worth.

5) **FSG runs financially sound operations**. Perhaps this should have been #1 or #2, they are so committed to this. Debt is toxic and it kills clubs in the long run (especially with FFP looming). FSG is always about long term dominance. They crave dynasties, and debt is not a part of that unless you're a Saudi Arabian prince like some of these other clowns. As far as I'm concerned, FSG has done a shockingly good job in turning the club's finances around.

6) FSG also does have a **strong sense of tradition.** They completely renovated historic Fenway Park (built 1912, not quite as old as Anfield) and the fans are *very* pleased with the work. They kept the spirit of the stadium in tact while making it accessible to more supporters. For example, they will never ever bulldoze the Kop or move the Shankly gates an inch to the left or right.

7) How long will FSG stick around? Honestly, I have no idea. FSG really enjoys owning sports franchises, but it's unclear whether it will translate into a long term passion. They certainly do take it seriously and they want to win. We'll have to wait and see, but I'm a Liverpool supporter for life regardless.

As for qualifications, well that's a tough one as jobs are so few and far between, and they have to be filled according to the need. The science route is get a degree in physics or equivalent (understanding electromagnetism is a big plus): this is great for modelling and consultation. The engineering route is probably electrical and/or electronic engineering: good for running experiments and making sure the generators work as expected. However we also have mechanical and workshop-skilled engineers because of the test rigs we have to bespoke make and because of the size of the equipment and generators we use and have to maintain. Having a mixture of skills is great, but most important is understanding electricity and having a healthy respect for it. You can't be too careful in this line of work...

Because to me that's what I want from my club, to be successful, but to be a good experience to have (ie, how good is it to go to matches, and how we do in competitions)

On the pitch, we're not that much further forward than where we were 3 years ago. Whilst I really like Brendan Rodgers and some of the football we've played this season has been great, and things look good for the future, but that's been the case for a number of seasons with no actual progression. I hope that changes next season, but the owners football plans are inconsistent. When they first came in they were happy to talk about their football naivety, now they talk about it like they're the guiding lights. If FSG are all about promoting youth, why were we willing to throw in Jordan Henderson into the Clint Dempsey deal last August, only for Henderson to reject it. They keep on ripping up the plan and starting again, hiring and firing people. We could see 4 first team players leave this summer and some people aren't batting an eyelid. 

Secondly the club has done fuck all to help fans. Season ticket prices keep going up, this year the date of renewal was moved forward a month, causing people who save year round for their ticket to potentially miss out. Spirit of Shankly discussed that issue with Ian Ayre, but they did it anyway, because it prices out fans who don't spend much at the game. I could go on...

The US wouldn't dare stop supporting Israel because they know the Christian backlash at home (and the Jewish lobby) would cripple the country if not destroy it. The EU toes the line of the US and lots of people here enjoy the idea of Zionism and Israel being another proxy crusader state.

I'm 22, £36k, mobile software developer. Take home is just shy of £2300 a month.

Contribution to mortgage and bills = £450 /month
(mortgage is £350 a month plus bills on top. Myself and my gf contribute towards these costs. I contribute £450, she contributes £300 due to the difference in pay. Our costs are less than £750 a month, so we usually have a bit left over to save).

I have no idea where the rest of it goes. I don't have a car, I pay every other week's shopping bill and I try to save a heap of it as well. I try to set aside £500 from each pay check.

I currently have about £5k in a savings account, £10k in a ""high interest"" ISA (high being about 4% haha... tough times), plus the deposit I put down on my flat was £25k.

It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"".

true,politicalcritic,,Birmingham,"First of all, welcome to the shithole I call home! Aston hall isn't worth visiting, there are plenty of tours of Villa's ground for sale on www.avfc.co.uk

As for Brum itself, some areas are sketchy. Aston isn't the nicest area but as long as you aren't out very late at night (10pm-2am) it isn't bad. Other tips are be careful where you admit you're a villa fan, we like tourists but football is a big thing in Brum. If you said it for example in a pub in Small Heath it may not go down to well. 

In Brum the bullring is worth a visit and the Mailbox or Broad street is good for food. If you want pubs near Villa's ground there is the Witton arms and Aston Hotel but I'm not sure of their opening times etc. Visiting Stratford is a good bet! Lots of culture! 

Edit: Adding more! Also depending on when you're going Villa are playing some pre-season matches in July, if you're in Brum around July 17-31st it's well worth going to a few games. Another thing a lot of tourists do is wear football shirts around town, personally I don't recommend this as it's kind of asking for trouble unless it's a United shirt or Arsenal etc. 

The trains here also do a regular trip to London for cheap so don't feel confined to Brum, as a whole Birmingham isn't the best for tourism and areas like Aston, Smallheath, Sollihull, Handsworth it's best to keep near the city center and not go wandering, but we are an alright lot. We have a good theatre called the Hippodrome too if you're into that. 

If you want advice for going to the ground I advise going from Birmingham new street station by train to the Witton road stop, you can see the ground from the stop and it's basically two roads away.

Alternatively, he could thrive under Pellegrini, he seems to have the same sort of grandfatherly relationship with players that Wenger has, and I think that could be good for Nasri. He's also got an advantage over Isco in that he can play opposite Silva. Isco generally plays on the left, and drops in to the center when needed, like Silva, or plays in the center from the start. But we tend to play Yaya in the center, with attacking mids to either side of them, and I don't see that changing under 4-3-3, which creates a problem. We could play with Silva as part of the attacking line, I seem to recall him playing allright in that role for Spain (although it was definitely better when there was a striker in the middle), but that would take a spot away from Reus, who also plays on that side.

I have been to many ATOS exams and yes I was declared fit for work which was patently ridiculous. In the last two weeks alone I have been in the hospital on 7 different days. I have also won my appeal against ATOS, as I made it very clear in my appeal that I knew how they are meant to mark things and that they wouldn't win a tribunal - something which many people in my position are simply not mentally well enough (or maybe even intelligent enough - no disrespect) to do.

However the Government also changed the law last year making it so that you can only claim Contribution Based Incapacity Benefit for a year, so even though they now recognize I am not fit for work, I still don't get any money, despite being extremely ill.

true,thetechguyv,null,null,"&gt; Yes I've heard things like you describe before: bag means you can carry stuff. Dressing yourself means you can concentrate for long periods? That kind of thing.

Indeed, you have to remember when attending these things they are not there to help you. They are in fact paid a bonus everytime they kick someone off illness related benefits. So most of them bend over backwards to do just that.

I am 'lucky' that in my case my illness is very visible, most assessors would take one look at me and realize they wouldn't get away with it and let me through. Last time the guy decided despite my many doctor notes, treatments, hospital dates and obvious illness that I didn't score any points. Despite still 'recognizing' that I was indeed sick.

&gt;How come you knew how they are meant to mark things?

The government have a clear public document of the criteria necessary to score the various points needed in the various categories etc to be declared not fit for work. Now ofc ATOS are paid to interpret this as harshly as possibly, whilst the government doesn't want it known that is how it is interpreted, so the public document is much looser in the way it describes the scoring. However if you can clearly satisfy the language of the public document (which is what the tribunals use when assessing), then ATOS will back off.

What they mainly rely on is people not knowing how to appeal properly (the provide practically no information on appeals, in fact when I had to appeal they sent me the appeal information for Jobseekers Allowance and no forms to fill in - had to go to the jobcentre and get that seperately), they also undertrain staff at Jobcentres meaning they basically don't know anything of real value and so it goes on. 

It is saving money, but not enough, and there are certainly other areas that could be leveraged to save money instead of this. The Tories don't care whether we die, and it's not just those of us who are already sick, watch what they're trying to do to the NHS.",0,1369954721,null,0,false,0,ca94aiy,t3_1fbza2,t1_ca94aiy,t1_ca942m1,null,1430979248,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;It's a massive waste when you consider that around four million tonnes of this food is perfectly alright to eat - fresh, tasty, and well within its sell-by-date.

The prospect isn't entirely realistic, but there were rumors about a Manchester City bid a month ago. He might be willing to transfer, but the problem would be him transferring to a non-CL team. Plus between Gotze and the possibility of Lewandowski being sold, Dortmund probably isn't looking for any more cash. I'd bet money it won't happen, but it is what I'd like.

In terms of realistic replacement? We'd split the cash several ways and spend 20m or less on a striker. If BR has faith in Sturridge, he might pick up a young player. Benteke has proven himself as worthy of a starting role on most teams. Steven Fletcher would be a good complement to Sturridge. Heung-Min Son ( 20yo Hamburger SV striker) has been linked to a lot of Premiere League Clubs. Benteke won't stay at Aston Villa if they remain where they are, Fletcher as well, and Son would be a lateral move (Hamburger finished 7th as well).

Great from that pure business side but not so much for trophy starved fans. Unfortunately, despite all of FSG's positives, I see them as viewing our club in a similar, business first kind of way, and I think they'd also be content with the also-ran position as long as our ""brand"" is appealing and we're generating our own revenue stream. I know a lot of people are holding out hope that FFP will work to our advantage in this respect, but I think the richer clubs will easily sidestep it tbh. The difference between running a club sustainably and simply piling cash in is that, unfortunately, the piles of cash will win you trophies more often than not.

http://your.asda.com/sustainability-food-waste

&gt;  In the UK, we use the following hierarchy to manage our waste:

&gt; * We try to minimise any waste – for example by reducing to-clear foods close to their expiry date in stores  
&gt; * If food cannot be sold, we offer it where possible to those in need by donating to charities  
&gt; * We send bakery waste to be converted into animal feed for livestock. Out of date chicken and raw meat products are processed into pet food and our chicken fat and cooking oil is converted into biodiesel  
&gt; * If these options are not available, we recover energy from food waste through anaerobic digestion or incineration

http://www.tescoplc.com/index.asp?pageid=596

&gt; All the bread and bakery waste from our stores, whether they are Supermarket or Locals is returned daily on the stores' returning delivery vehicles, consolidated in our regional distribution centres and sent to be processed into animal feed to support our farming industry.

&gt; The remaining food waste from both our supermarkets and locals is collected and sent to anaerobic digesters. In Scotland the remaining food waste is collected from store and sent back to an Anaerobic Digestion plant in Cumbernauld. In England and Wales it is collected by Biffa and sent to The Poplars, Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, a relatively new anaerobic digestion facility which opened in June last year, and is thought to be the biggest in the UK. It will process up to 120,000 tonnes of food waste from homes and businesses every year to produce enough renewable energy to power 10,000 homes and a soil improver that can be used in the same way as compost.

On multiple occasions, Moffat has said sexist, misogynistic, and once or twice ableist things and according to most (though I've not actually watched the newest season so I can't say personally) he's run the show into the ground since he's been in the lead. Between the generic characters (i.e. River and Amy are basically clones of each other, Clara has a similar backstory, etc.) and their disturbing focus on /only/ the doctor (both clara and amy were obsessed from their childhood, River was literally raised to know him and only him) it's rather bothersome. Not to mention upsettingly creepy that he's being so interested in the lives of young children so suddenly. Not that he's a pedophile but it's just odd. 

As far as him saying things, he's been rude to fans, basically outright stated that he hired Karen because she's sexy, has put himself on a pedestal for supporting gay/bi rights via characters that were in the show for one episode or their sexuality wasn't even acknowledged. Some might even say he only said they were to get out of a poor situation in the eyes of the fans.

It doesn't help that his treatment of fans in general is poor. On twitter he insulted a dyslexic fan, telling them to get spell check and when told about their dyslexia he didn't apologize or acknowledge it in any way. He's repeatedly acted like a 10 year old when someone criticizes anything he's said or anything in either of his shows and refused to treat his fans with any respect when he's corrected.

Yes, Team Fortress 2.

Got into it in July 2011 when I traded up to what seemed like a free Skyrim preorder. 

I buy items (usually entire backpacks from players leaving the game, other cheap stuff, or just cheaper 'currency' items) and resell them individually for higher prices.

I sell for me; no real team as such (there's some people whom I trade with regularly for stuff though). 

For pure money in one go, I think it was $360. For items+cash, about $600. Most I spent in one go was about $1500 (got a $1700 transaction lined up hopefully for tomorrow).

Not sure what you mean by business model. I buy stuff, sort it, sell it on?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I just want him gone now. I'd rather use that money to buy two or three young players with exceptional talent and great potential. As great a player as he is there's a massive downside. With players like Suarez, Messi, Ronaldo, the other 10 players on the pitch can become overshadowed and complacent. When Suarez is playing other's don't get the opportunity to perform to the best of the their ability because their first instinct is 'Where's Suarez and how can I get the ball to him.'  It's only natural when you have a player as good as he is. But, would you call Suarez a team player? I certainly wouldn't. 

It's not a coincidence that since his latest suspension our performances as a *team* have massively improved. Instead of Suarez trying to win it by himself we've had standout performances from three or four players in some games. I'm definitely trying to put a positive spin on him leaving, but I'm also speaking the truth. With Suarez gone it gives room (literally, seeing as Suarez tends to go wherever the ball is) for other players to shine. 

If the team had fallen off after Luis' ban I might be shitting myself right now. But it was the *exact* opposite. Arguably we played some of our best football of the season. I know you can say 'Well the teams we played were shit,' but that's nothing new. There's 13 shit teams in the league that we should always be destroying. 

Think of it this way. Would you rather one of the best players in the world winning games for us single handedly, or 15-17 quality players that play as a unit, as a team, that win games because the *team* has performed well, not just a single player? 

Suarez is a genius, but 'He's irreplaceable' are words that have been uttered for generations in football, and as we've seen time and time again, it almost certainly always turns out not to be true.

The next Liverpool star is already out there.

&gt;As proof, the authors point to the fact that the title character has never been played by a black or Asian actor

If this isn't a stretch for proof, I don't know what is. There have been only 11 actors total who have played the Doctor in the official canon (going off of the TV programme, I'm not well-verse in the novels/comics).By an unspoken rule, they must be British (or at least have one type of a British English accent), so they can't just be any actor.

The number of high-profile British actors who were minorities from 1963 until the early 1980s is probably not a significant number, due to the barriers faced by minority actors, but also because Britain was largely a 'white' country until after the Second World War. Immigration from newly-independent India didn't start until after its independence in 1947, nor from the Commonwealth African countries until the 1960s ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_1922#Post-war_immigration)). Racism and difficulties for minorities in a newly-multiethnic country is more a comment on that country as a whole instead of a single TV show. The BBC of the early 1960s was not in the business of breaking racial barriers, because nobody else was. William Hartnell was an already well-known actor and a draw for the new show.
 
&gt;The book, which is set for release in July, also derides the show's historical use of white actors to play ethnic characters, the portrayal of primitive people as savages and an inappropriately ""slapstick"" take on Hitler in a 2011 episode.

This first part is a decent point. Blackface or whatever was used (I haven't watched Classic Who) is not acceptable, and the BBC could have tried to use minority extras. It may be the case that this was the norm in British broadcasting in the 60s-80s, so there needs to be context as to whether it happened elsewhere. It doesn't excuse the show for doing it, however.

The article doesn't specify which stories the book refers to when it talks about 'primitive people', so I don't know what to say about that.

But this last point about the 'slapstick' in 'Let's Kill Hitler' is stupid. The author is trying to argue that any representation of Adolf Hitler *outside* that of a maniacal killer and dictator is unacceptable? *Fuck that noise.* Hitler was a person, a truly awful and despicable person, but he was a PERSON. That means he had a personality and was not a robot capable of only evil. Including a story that visited 1930s Berlin was probably a questionable move on Moffat's part, because he likely just did it for pizzazz. But having **ONE** extended scene where Hitler is shoved into a closet *isn't* any sort of justification or revision of WWII or the horrors of the Holocaust. It was a single scene. There was no jab-in-the-ribs ""hey Hitler how ya doin'"" going on. The characters were horrified by his presence, and Rory almost shot him. Representing a historical figure in a show that deals with time-travel IS NOT UNACCEPTABLE.

Another article....he's away from the club and this always happen when he's on international duty. Don't think it's any more likely he'll leave now than it was 2 months ago or even 6 months ago.

Either way I'm not having this shit and the club shouldn't either. The club has the player contracted, has all the power and unless someone stumps up a straight £40m minimum they won't even talk to them. Even if he's unhappy I think they'll tell him to suck it up for another year minimum, he already owes them for sticking by him and I don't think FSG are the kind to be pushed around. Don't see it happening, it just isn't practical or logical for a deal to be made this summer for either buying or selling clubs when it'll be much cheaper and less tricky in a years time.

I don't buy into this attitude of him saying he wants to leave and being simply allowed to, even if it is for a big fee. He SIGNED a contract and as a professional is the property of the club. Knowing his personality of loving to play I doubt he would refuse to play at all if we simply told him 'sorry mate, not this summer'. We need to put our foot down and tell him quite simply 'no', which is well within our rights.

Nor do I buy the attitude of if he doesn't want to be here then good riddance, nobody is bigger than the club. In the modern day they're all just mercenaries, he is too valuable a commodity to be sold because of silly words like this.

As I walked up to my daughters I twiddled the first set of lights and nothing happened.  I criss crossed the seafront and perfected it.  From then on for about two weeks (there was a technique, honestly, I'm not making this up) EVERY set of lights changed instantly.  I used to stand to the side to check it was instant (as obviously the first change would be the orange light to the traffic).  EVERY FUCKING TIME.  This could not have been a coincidence.  My daughter and I saw our future as Masters of the Universe.  Once, hilariously I did the ""thing"" straight after the lights had gone green for the traffic and you could actually see the drivers looking puzzled at the brevity of the green lights.

Then one day I started to worry that I might inadvertently cause an accident.  I needn't have worried.  It has NEVER worked since.  So, either it was an actual thing, or it was the most massive two week long series of coincidences, or it was ""the power of attraction"" and my increasing lack of conviction destroyed my powerful brain-rays.

The Financial Times Guide to Investing is a great starting read, chunky but fairly digestible and quite through. new editions are necessary tho, it goes over the basics and more of a variety of instruments. Some of its not really relevant but i think its worth the read if you are looking for a starting point into finance investing.

Eventually technical or fundamental analysis can be interesting, most people tend to immediately like the look of one. I looked into technical, charts and indicators, Elder Alexander is a great starter author on that. My flatmate is a business analyst and loves fundamental, he has given me a few brilliant tips. but i'm just not that interested, i would rather look into say more commodities or play with some more leverage

The Tories however granted them their wish genie-style, and left the party with absolutely nothing to show for their time in partial power that will benefit them in future elections. It absolutely wasn't a power-grab, because it was plainly obvious that the Lib Dems were going to get a couple of pre-agreed things brought up, and for the rest of it they were there to make up the numbers.

Do I think they made the right choice? With hindsight, obviously not, they should have refused all coalitions. Being in power is a poisoned chalice right now in this economy, and it's impossible to get through a term without building up a lot of resentment and anger from the public. If they had held off, they wouldn't be getting scapegoated at all, and they would be innocent of everything that has gone wrong in the last few years. They could then have made a go of it when things turn around.

That being said, I think at the time they made the best decision they could. Voting reform is the only way an outside party is going to get a look in these days, Lib Dems included. With the reform, an election like the last one would see the Lib Dems actually having a position of fair power in a coalition.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"Great question. There's certainly been a learning curve (last summer's transfer window was a total disaster, we'll see if this year is an overreaction to that late summer stress), but I will say this:

I don't think that FSG expected to have *this* much to learn in their second sport. They were already used to spending these sums of money, they were used to the media being total sharks (Boston writers are as bloodthirsty and unreliable as the s*n), and they are used to running an organization from the top down (the Red Sox run a complete system from single-A all the way to the majors, and teach their players to play a certain way, just like Rodgers aims to do from the academy upwards)

Here's what I don't think they expected:

1) Getting sniped all the time on the talent they're scouting. They're used to bidding wars, but between 3 teams, not a dozen on an international scale.

2) Opponents operating on *that* much debt. In baseball every owner is at least trying to turn a profit. Over here it seems like there are some owners who simply don't give a shit about blowing tens of millions of pounds, and that's a bit of a wake-up call. In baseball it's basically just the Yankees who have that luxury.

3) That initial backlash to not having enough troops on the ground in the city of Liverpool itself. FSG would probably say, ""What's the big deal? We're running a business here and putting people in charge who we think will put us in a position to win."" I think those events taught FSG a lot about the fan base and they gained a lot of respect for the supporters. If only one thing came out of it, it's that FSG wanted to make very sure that transfer window fiasco never happened again.

FSG learns and adapts very quickly, though, and I wouldn't peg them as quitters. I don't think they'll leave the league without having made a serious effort at achieving Liverpool's (and their own) high standards for success. I think they saw these first three years as a learning period while they turned the club's finances around. Now they will expect success.

I'm not so sure how much longer Ian Ayre will last. FSG likes to give coaches and administrators a fair shot to keep their jobs when they take over. Last summer they let go of Carroll with the *firm* expectation that Dempsey was a done deal. We'll see if Ayre has done enough in that fantastic January window to save his job.",0,1369967551,null,0,false,0,ca98jlo,t3_1fcpu6,t1_ca98jlo,t1_ca97v4h,null,1430977245,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,Greyfeld,angel,Weeping Angel,"I actually wrote up something to explain this bit in another thread last week. Let me dig it up...

Ah, here we go.

&gt;I felt like 10's rant at Wilf and his overall raging against his inevitable death was all part of the previous several episodes, where the weight of a lot of different things just sort of pulled him in every direction at once.

&gt;He was in pain over losing another companion (and probably in the worst way possible, from his point of view) and struggling to decide if he should continue alone. He let the stress of that problem go to his head, pushing him to break a fixed point in time in Waters of Mars so he could at least save somebody. When his failure slapped him in the face, he immediately got called to approach the time of his own death. 

&gt;Then after a hopeless and bitter struggle to stave off the leaders of his race, which was a shock in and of itself since he had thought all of that was locked away in the past, a ray of sunshine peaks through the turbulent storm clouds. That tiny sliver of hope, shining in his eyes, telling him that he doesn't have to die afterall. He laughs. A hopeful chuckle, overflowing with relief.

&gt;**Knock Knock Knock Knock**

&gt;*No...*

&gt;**Knock Knock Knock Knock**

&gt;*You've got to be kidding me....*

&gt;And he looks up. At Wilf, behind the glass. And it hits him. *It was the old man. It was always the old man. This old man who had no part of the story, who had no part in saving the world, of turning back the darkness; this is the reason he's here. The only reason. He's here to make sure that I die.*

&gt;In that moment, the universe has been so unfair that it can only be a conspiracy. The universe must have some sort of grudge, that this unimportant man - this useless man - be the hand of his destruction. Well, he doesn't have to play by those rules. He can turn around and walk away. He can live. He's important. He can save more worlds, he can save more lives! There's still so much to do and to see!! It would be so easy, to just turn and walk away...

&gt;But no... that's not who he is. He is the Doctor. He is promised to save life, to preserve it. Even this one useless man. Even if it's the last life he'll ever save. Even if it means his death.

&gt;And so he walks through the glass and presses the button. The button the universe has prepared for him. It's not fair, and it shouldn't end this way.

&gt;But it does. Because he is the Doctor.",0,1369968872,null,0,false,0,ca9908m,t3_1fc0lr,t1_ca9908m,t1_ca8x0jj,null,1430977027,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

There's a scene where he talks to her as a child, but he doesn't know it's her, theoretically. As for Amy, I think I'd almost have preferred it if he had taken her with him when she was little. Would have changed the story significantly, and been a real departure for the show, and probably lost a few viewers, but worth it, I think.

Can't say as I've listened to or read much about what Moffat has said outside of his official capacity, in things like Confidential or the like, so I'm not sure I've heard much misogyny or anti-LGBT leanings.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This gets asked on /r/gallifrey all the time so I'll give the basic breakdown

1. Overcomplicated plot or the Kudzu plot.
A Kudzu plot or in my mind ""the Lost plot"", is a plot that has grown really large and complex. Any attempt to answer to plot raises more questions or does not completely wrap up the plot. Further growing the plot, is the fact that every time a answer is attempted, the writer introduces more mystery. As the plot grow, fans get frustrated once they realize that the plot will never be wrapped up. Moffat's big Kudzu plot is the who is River Song which tied into what are causing the cracks which led to Amy's baby which now ties into what is the name of the Doctor and finally who is John Hurt playing? Many questions about the plot is still not answered like who blew up the Tardis? How did they blow up the Tardis? What happened to Madame Kovarian? What did River do in between regenerating into Mels and meeting Amy? How did River find out the Doctor's name? What happened in the Singing Towers? 
2. Overhyping. Moffat has this habit of getting really, really excited about episodes. This is reinforced by the half-season arc which raises expectations, the shorts released before episodes and the constant reminders to mysteries which leads to high expectations for season finales. When the episodes don't deliver, fans are disappointed. Do it enough and fans get frustrated. When Moffat initially wrote under RTD, fans didn't have as high expectations. Blink was touted as the first Doctor lite show and fans didn't know what to think. They expected little and were blown out of the water by a very good plot. This also ties into the Kudzu plot where many fans wanted to see say the adventure where River learns the Doctor's name or the singing towers but which probably will never happen. 
3. Female companions. I'm not going state whether Steven Moffat is sexist. That is a separate thing. What is true that the Moffat-era female companions are rather same-y, variations on a theme, one not necessarily liked by the plurality of the fanbase. They are all white, sexually aggressive, self-confident and bold to the point of recklessness. They are not exactly the same but similar enough that many fans do notice. 
4. Lack to two-parters. The lack of two-parters limits stories and messes with the pacing of episodes leading to stories that push too much plot into too little time and limiting the complexity of plots. The Silver Nightmare is a good example where Neil Gaiman by his own admission had to cut 15 minutes out of his story. Many people have stated that episodes feel too rushed with Clara and the Doctor talking really fast all the time. It also makes some episodes feel like they have a rushed conclusion.

Look at the threads we had here the other day [[1](http://ww.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1f9iq0/how_are_you_finding_life_in_the_uk), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1f9zjh/those_of_you_looking_to_emigrate_from_the_uk_is/)].

Things may not be perfect elsewhere, but an British ex-pat living in China doesn't have the same emotional investment if the Chinese government does something stupid. When that happens, you can just shrug your shoulders and say ""oh, they're crazy over here, the world's a crazy place"". 

Stay away and enjoy Britain through rose-tinted glasses. Honestly, it's much better that way.

&gt; …  the justification is typically revealing. … Which is to say that she was arrested because of potential Muslim violence. This Muslim felony rule is being used to go after people who “provoke” Muslim violence.

Uh, no, ""consideration for further offences being committed by the individual or others"" means that other people would have stared chanting ""go back to your own country"" if the officers present had been seen not to act.

Maybe people would have started throwing things at the mosque's worshippers or started rioting - a stretch, perhaps, but no more so than the blogger's assumption that she was arrested to save her from muslim violence!

Furthermore, the original letter from the plod super states:

[*""every time a officer places handcuffs on an individual, they have to take into account the person's age, physical state, demeanour and actions. They have to be able to account for the decision to apply handcuffs. If a person is calm and compliant on arrest they would not be handcuffed, but where they assault an officer, handcuffs will be applied until the person is compliant or at the police station where they will be removed.""*](http://i.imgur.com/42zekG5.jpg)

Now I have known cops lie about this stuff, but we can't draw conclusions of that from the letter. 

I can only guess why she was arrested, but I doubt if anyone arrested of a public order offence ever things they did anything wrong. It's the nature of it - you get into an altercation with someone because he wronged you, pushed in the queue or something, next thing you know you're in a shouting match, and when the cops are called they refuse to take your side. Who ever thinks they deserve to be handcuffed and held against their will?

Unfortunately we live in an era in which there is a strongly divided dissensus about what this woman did - some will argue that one should be able to yell whatever one likes in the street, others will say that ""go back to your own country"" is inherently a kind of racial harassment which should not be allowed. If this lady wants to challenge that in court she has every right, but part of the process is being arrested.

Hey, recently i've come to terms with the fact a lot of these subs are forgetting how satire works. Is this post still satirical?

The issue is a lot of these in satire form are not funny, and pretty much make 0 sense. But in the actual extremist sense it's easily something a fuck-nuts crazy nationalist would do. And actually do quite often. A week ago you guys had a massive list of ""British inventions."" Now all of these only touched English hands for maybe a quarter of a second, so it's possible it was a jock at how extremists slam that around just like how 'Merica mocked extremists act like we won WW2 alone. But if you actually read the comments, it sounds like a lot of people are taking this shit at face value and aren't joking at all.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"This post is truly awful, and I think you typically post good stuff, so I find it surprising.

First off, FSG bought the club at the beginning of October in 2010. It is now (for simplicity) June 1, 2013. It's been 2 years and 7 months. They've owned the club for 2.5 seasons and you are upset we haven't yet seen back-to-back years of progress? That's pretty damn unrealistic for new owners and 2 brand new managers to have immediate success, wouldn't you say?

With regards to the stadium, if you want real progress, start campaigning the LFC city council and the Anfield neighborhood property owners. FSG had to depend on so many things going right to renovate Anfield instead of move to Stanley Park. Personally, I am okay waiting a few extra years if it means LFC stays at the greatest venue in English football. 

Plus, it would be so dumb to secure financing now, not 3 years in to a serious rebuilding project, to build a stadium. Arsenal was crippled by the burden of building the Emirates and only now, through very savvy development of Highbury and very expensive tickets, are getting to where they are financially stable. For a club that had RVP, Fabregas, Nasri, and Song (among others) they could weather the storm of financial weakness for a few seasons (and partially by selling those 4 listed for very good sums and buying just well enough with part of the money gained).

As for youth, as many have pointed out, including the top rated post on this comments section, FSG is *not* just about youth. They buy youth players predominantly, but they try to mix in high-performing players regardless of age, along with talented veterans who gel well with the squad. And anyway, we bought a 23 yo Suarez, a 21 yo Henderson, 23 yo Carroll, 25 yo Adam in two windows, which were judged to be largely poor together. Carroll, Adam, and Downing--and even Henderson, yet--were not successful buys, but it has nothing to do with youth. Further, they added Borini, Allen, Coutinho, and Coates and they were all very young (and I don't feel like looking up their exact ages on my phone). They are focusing on young players, but paying £4 million + Henderson for Dempsey isn't a bad move because Henderson is younger, or even because we bought him for £16 million. It's a bad move because Dempsey isn't worth it.

As for your total fears of who we lose this summer, surely you can see it is extremely unfair to get pissy about what FSG did to LFC in the summer of 2013 on May 31, right? FSG don't want to sell Suarez, that much is clear, and anyone else who leaves will be down to Brendan. It's important to realize that having most of the control was a stipulation of BR moving here. He turned down the job initially when finding out we wanted a DoF and outright said he works best when he's in control. We changed structure and came back to him with the job and he accepted. If we end up in the shit (Ramsay &lt;3 ) this summer with players being sold, it will mostly be BR's fault, not FSG's. There's simply no way I'm buying that FSG or Ayre are going to sell a player BR wants to keep and who isn't forcing a move.

He signed players that he knew because it was his first transfer window as the new Liverpool manager and that's what managers do - they often try and sign players they trust and know to do a good job. Look at Mourinho, he signed Carvalho when he went to Madrid, and later signed Essien. 

Granted, Rodgers' ex-player signings haven't panned out amazingly, but Allen had a good start to the season and Borini, whilst not lighting the world on fire, has shown promising signs, and been very unlucky with his injuries.

The difference in cuts between the two main parties were really quite small, so while people berate Tory cuts as evil, and might justify Labour cuts as necessary -- there is no doubt that in terms of actual government spending, the difference would be negligible.

However, I think the public would be deeply cynical about the politicians in charge -- especially as was recently revealed that Gordon Brown was refusing to step down as Prime Minister in a Lib-Lab pact.

Research shows that the overwhelming majority of murderers and rapists use these to gain access to their victims. Anyone caught using a road in any way is clearly a predator-to-be and needs to be pre-emptively locked up until we can find the resources to destroy these devil's highways.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Although, like older Britons, they do not think much of mass immigration, they are tired of politicians banging on about it. 

Which is ironic given that politicians tried for so long to ignore public sentiment. This is just the normal political grinder. The only reason we are hearing pro-immigration sentiments is because anti-immigration has become a political topic. Same way suddenly so many people are pro-European after decades of being in a Eurosceptic echo chamber.

&gt; One change would help. If 18- to 24-year-olds voted as reliably as the over-65s, it would mean almost 2m more ballots, and politicians would have to pay attention. For the sake of freedom, the young should hurry to the polling station.

This is to misunderstand the problem. Young people don't avoid the polling stations because they don't care. They don't vote because Labour and the Tories are run by 55 year olds that think like the people they are opposed to. Those parties won't change their views because 2m people started voting. They might alter the rhetoric to fight for those votes but they wouldn't change a single policy.

No the youth have to infiltrate and steal the parties in order to be heard. Which takes decades. Which is why their voting tendency increases as they get older. More of the people in the parties come to represent them 20 years later.

Politics in this country is only incidentally driven by voting. If you aren't at the heart of the big parties you don't really have a say. At least that is how it will be while it is so hard to put new parties into government. It is easier in say Germany where the Pirate Party now sit in government. New parties can quickly gain proportional traction. There is no need to steal the incumbent parties and change their views from within.

The ideal that ""if only the youth voted"" is nonsense. It would take monumental political activism to make those votes matter.",0,1369990564,null,0,1369991073,0,ca9dy0b,t3_1fe5tb,t1_ca9dy0b,t3_1fe5tb,null,1430974917,76,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,76

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"The problems with this approach are 

1. that it assumes without definitive evidence a causal link between viewing child porn and attacks on children. That link may exist, and a demand for material probably fuels the production of that stuff, but...

2. it also conflates child porn with every other kind of porn and presumes that they are all equally bad, possibly because in someone's mind they are all lumped together in the category of ""*Things I dislike*"". In some countries and in some states, porn of all kinds is illegal, but in some states it is quite legal though restricted to adults, just like alcohol. Some people dislike the idea of drinking alcohol and would like to see it banned everywhere. Does that mean it should be?

3. the proposed technical solutions, like banning certain keywords, are doomed to fail, and will hurt legitimate businesses.
Prudish parents might be offended by what turns up in a search for ""cute pussies"", but defaulting to safe search (I believe Google already does this) will not prevent people enabling unfiltered results.
Go further and ban that search phrase just because it has unsavoury connotations and you will also annoy legitimate cat enthusiasts.

It might well be true that some child porn is lurking under the phrase ""teenage sex"", but that term probably covers much legitimate material too, and the producers of it would be harmed by banning the keywords.

Ban all the search terms we think are associated with child porn, and within weeks people who produce it and consume it will start using other phrases.
I dunno, how about: ""Fresh fruit"", ""Recent graduates"", ""New entries"". Ban those phrases, and you also hurt grocers, employment agencies and music sales. And the same material will show up again within weeks under other search terms.

Banning domain names and IP addresses too, will only mean the same material pops up somewhere else. ""The internet regards censorship as damage and routes around it"".

The only sure way to resolve this is to go after the producers who, in the case of child porn, are directly involved in the abuse anyway.
That's not easy – it requires international co-operation by governments and legal agencies – but continually talking about technical solutions just avoids the real problem.

FY1s can do additional bank work (i.e. extra shifts in the SAME hospital trust where they are employed, usually as holiday cover). If you had an unbanded 8-5 job like psych or public health you could potentially, but your standard medicine/surgery FY1 wouldn't have the hours to fit it in.

SHOs and Registrars can do locum work (i.e. extra shifts in any trust that are not part of a training programme). But again a banded SpR with on call commitments would struggle to find the time. Some people do a full year of just locum work. It used to be quite profitable (or alternatively you could earn okay amounts doing fewer shifts for some work:life balance).

When you choose your speciality though remember at that stage you're only looking at 7-9 years to getting a CCT. So there is a school of thought that says you shouldn't choose it based on your on calls/working patterns as a SpR... because really thats only going to be ~7 years out of ~35, so most will be at the consultant grade. A pretty good example of that is probably the medical registrar who has pretty awful working patterns, but a few years later as a consultant rheumatologist they can potentially work fairly standard hours, mostly in the OPD. Of course the reality is a bit more complicated because around the middle grade SpR time is when most people start to find themselves waylaid with children and other real-life commitments.

The Doctor now has known all three of these women since they were kids and had sexual energy thrown at him by all three. It's boring right now even with the the complex plot additives. I loved the 9/10 years because even though there were cheesy elements or outright annoying ones (like the aliens wearing people as a disguise) they were still great stories. I've been finding the 11 stories quite boring in the sense that everything works out and the episodes just seems to be too short to cover everything that comes up in them. I also have been findig them a little bit too geered towards a young audience. I agree with the doctor obsession  that people have mentioned and the over use of River. This is just how I've been feeling about doctor who. I don't feel as excited about as I once did. I miss Tennant and Eccleson (sp sorry) because those years with them were still complex stories while bein enjoyable. Also I would still like to know what happened to the Doctors daughter. Clara has been almost hyped through the show and then her climax (plot wise) is that she has been around helpin the doctor for all eternity. I call lazy writing.

2.5 years of training every player on the squad to play around Suarez, Lucas and Gerrard, you can't recreate that with one signing.

That is also why it makes financial sense to offer large contract renewals to players who work out, because the alternate is to spray 4 or 5 deals across new signings and hoping after a year that one will work out (and he will want a new larger contract in that case anyway).

Dortmund are the exception, not the rule. They have been very fortuitous (of their own making) but have also had bad signings and have had to ramp up their wages to turnover ratio. If Dortmund were capable of offering Gotze or Lewandowski the money that Bayern are giving them then you bet your ass they would have. You are not only losing the output of that player, but you are giving it to an opponent, which means your replacement needs to be even *better*.

You can't bend over to tapping up so easily, if one club gets away with it then others will as well. Liverpool need to be very firm on Suarez staying, there is very little upside to selling him on.

I think Real Madrid's play here is to sign him for cheap, something like 30m euro plus a player. I think their main target is Bale, and they don't have the funds for two 60M euro signings.

So taking a medicine after it's expiry date, at *best* you're looking at a dose under what it was designed to deliver. For something like ibuprofen, that's obviously not a huge deal. For antibiotics however, this could be a bigger deal with the onset of resistance and whatnot. The degradation of the API could be to something not so nice for your body, which would lead to another issue - for instance aspirin degrades in the presence of water to salicyclic acid. Some people leave a dispersal-able tablet of aspirin in water, forget about it, take it the next day and then complain of not feeling quite right - probably because degradation has occurred.

As for a more *worse* case scenario, obviously more dangerous breakdown products could be formed from certain drugs, can't quite think of anything off the top of my head though right now.

true,Missing_Link,lfc12,,"It is very simple. Transfers represent one of the biggest and definitely one of the most volatile income/expenditures in the football industry. Managing that volatility correctly is the ONLY WAY to grow to the next level in the medium term. Yes, winning trophies brings fans and then income but this takes many years to develop and reap sustainable rewards.

A simplified example to illustrate this:

You have a squad of 20 players and the total value in your estimation is £200m. So, the average 'quality' of your players is £10m. This is one of the strongest predictors of how successful the team will be.

Your operating profits allow an injection of £20m per year. In a perfect world, your squad should be 'improving' by 10%. Of course there are many variables but I would argue that just about the biggest is transfer market volatility. So you need to have a model that objectively evaluates 'worth'.

If you spot a Coutinho, that your model estimates to be worth £20m and you can get him for £10m then you have gained £10m in value (turning your 10% improvement into 15%). Similarly, if your model says Suarez is 'worth' £40m and you are offered £50m. It has to be considered for the overall benefit.

Be in a +£20m gain situation for your dealings in the window and instead of improving your average 'quality' to £11m, you have increased it to £12m. (+20%!)

Of course mistakes can be made but that allows refining of the model. Only through doing this consistently can your £200m squad become a £300m squad and still be financially sustainable.

This is why paying £35m for Carroll was especially disasterous. We 'lost' £20m in overall 'value' at least through that transaction, meaning the benefit of income injected into transfers was lost instantly and we (at best) were standing still instead of progressing.",0,1369997735,null,0,1369998063,0,ca9esq0,t3_1fe67a,t1_ca9esq0,t3_1fe67a,null,1430974671,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

There are several drugs that are proscribed on an 'as needed' basis, or 'for emergencies'; depending on the specific condition.

It is know at the time of prescription that much of them will not get used - but it's a trade off to give someone tools to self manage, rather than requiring intervention of a medical professional at every problem.  It can cost less, and be much more liberating, to give someone a buffer stock than continuously monitor.


Secondly, that service (at least at the pharmacies that I know) also accepts OTC medication.  Indeed, that's how I've used it - to dispose of half a sheet (4 or 5 tablets) of opiate based pain relief (left overs from post-operative medication), and a larger pile of out of date paracetamol (from a clear out round the house).

**EU-US free trade deal**: In light of the recent EU horse meat scandal where we can expect our food supplies to be intercepted by Polish and Italian mafia and given that the US are reknowned for having their food saturated in corn starch, corn powder and corn syrup as this is their biggest export which has resulted in Americans severely suffereing from allergies/lactose intolerance (and is why they aren't as common here) on top of Americas, quite frankly, barbaric farming attitudes - don't you think this will undermine ethical farming in Britain where we have a decent, ethical and high standard of farming?

I live in a close with a bit of green space. There's only one road in or out, and it's often choked by parked cars. It's brilliant for kids. They can play out on their bikes or run around. It would be very difficult for a predator to snatch them, and they are less at risk from the infinitely more likely danger of being run over. All we need now is a speed bump at the end of the road and I'll be happy.

If we had more walkable communities then life for kids would be better and safer. But sadly the car fetish in the UK makes that unlikely.

The original satirical members leave, and the population has only serious people left. The subs pretty much changed forever at that point. 

I daren't visit it, but a common reddit story on this kind of thing is /r/niggers - started off as a joke (tasteless, and not particularly humourous, but I can see where other people would find it funny I suppose) but it attracted the wrong crowd, and now it's more or less a Klan meeting. 

A similar thing has happened with /r/cringepics, too, and I eventually unsubbed. It started out as watching somebody facebook message a girl, awkwardly ask her out, she says no, then the guys mum chimes in saying how good of a catch her son is and how she should reconsider, for example. The idea was you cringe *on behalf* of the guy, and feel sorry for him. Nowadays it's just 'Some fat guy put a picture of himself on facebook, lets all bully this neckbeard lel' circlejerks. 

Another point, /r/funny is no longer funny. 

I think that's just how Reddit works. Subreddits can be seen as a metaphor for Stars. They burn brighter and brighter (getting more and more subs) until they burn too bright (number of people who will alter the subreddits 'culture' reaches a critical mass) then it starts to burn up (original subs leave) and it becomes a black hole (only the later subs are left, and the subreddit is changed.)

The World Wars, expecially World War 2, didn't just end when peace was signed. America was still occupying Japan until 1951, 12 years after the war started. The Western and Eastern powers had soldiers stationed all over Germany until practically the end of the Soviet Union, 1990, 51 years after the start of the Second World War. 

Plus, the World Wars were totally different. They were wars between two highly developed countries, with many of the soldiers fighting for their countries rather than ideologies, and mainly fought through open warfare. Afghanistan was different, seeing that it is a less developed country, the soldiers are fighting for ideologies (so they won't give up easily), and they fought mainly through guerilla warfare.

They didn't take on their parents attitudes - while many might not support gay marriage, they are still tolerant - certainly very few would want to criminalise homosexuality.

IMO the whole thing is a clusterfuck. If someone's got a physical disability then it should be about handholding them back into work, not pulling out the support from underneath them.

As far as mental health is concerned it's a mess because doctors don't have the resources for certain kinds of treatment, so the best thing they can do is sign patients on the sick and hope that, relieved of the pressure of work, they'll recover naturally in their own time (or at least not deteriorate). So a lack of resources in the NHS is loading costs onto the benefits system - instead of paying a year's intensive therapy for those that need it, we're paying for several years' of rent &amp;c.

Until now his biggest accomplishment is making the Belgians love their team again. Between 2006-2008 we played matches in near empty stadiums but thanks to the belief in our new generation the national team got hot again.

Unfortunately that trainer was spotted by a top club in Belgium. He joined them and left the national team. This was last year. The assistent trainer became our new trainer. Marc Wilmots. 


Seriously? I hate Leekens with a passion. I really think he was about the worst possible choice for the RD. He seems so have no social skills (fighting with his players all the time), can't seem judge how good a player is, terrible tactics, terrible ego, etc.


When Leekens was elected to coach i was sure we weren't going to qualify. The day he became the new Brugge coach, all my friends who were Bruges fans instantly stopped going. He got fired after running that into the ground after half a year.

Some tidbits about his half year coaching job at Bruges:

* Went from #1 to about #7 in the league and losing against the bottom teams.

* It took +5 games of the fans chanting player names (Vasquez &amp; Bacca) before he finally let them play. These players were 2 of the best in the entire league and Bacca easily became the topscorer in the league. Benching those players was just retarded.

* Constant injuries. Most players seemed to blame it on bad training regimens.


Honestly, i can keep ranting for hours about this guy. It is NOT a coincidence that the Belgian team went from about #50 when Leekens was in charge to about #12 now.

A feminist working within these definitions and calling for a ban on ""pornography"" therefore is not trying to ban all pictures of naked people, but rather pictures of naked people that include an exploitative element.  Calling for this has a large numbers of problems, but it isn't quite as extreme as literally trying to ban people from looking at all pictures of naked people.

Best example as when we had one guy who had collected large monthly scripts of insulin amongst other things for years die and his daughter returned all of his medication, inside a cardboard box were over 100 boxes of expensive insulin.  

I doubt he used much if any of it for whatever reason and never told his doctor as such, quite how he lasted as long as he did is beyond me however.  

There was also a popular image doing the rounds at pharmacies of a pharmacist holding a large beaker stuffed with viagra prior to crushing and disposal, all from one patient who had diligently collected his prescription every single month, popped all the pills out of their packaging and then did nothing with besides collect them.

The scale of wastage is amazing and when expensive brand name pharmaceuticals are in use the money wasted is ridiculous.  It is however the unfortunate side effect of providing people with pharmaceuticals at little to no cost to them, many (most) people have no concept of the true cost of those little pills and vials they collect.

Given that this is averaged out of the whole country, it's a meaningless statistic. Someone on a decent salary does not a have a low quality of life.

&gt; lower salaries

This really depends. It's not like each country has a salary coefficient that determines how much your skills are worth. For many graduate-level positions, yes, American make more on average, but there are plenty of very well paid jobs in the UK.

The NHS is still free at the point of care. In America, medical bankruptcy is a real thing. And you don't have to be poor for it to happen to you. You've just gotta wish you're lucky (or rich).

I wouldn't mind leaving the UK as well at some point, but it's not all doom and gloom as you make out.

true,iamPause,lfc68,,"I agree with you 100%. The club, hell, every organized sport anymore, is a business. No more, no less. Every single person involved is involved to make money. You think Rodgers would have come to us if we didn't offer him a good salary? You think Luiz is going to stay if we don't give him good wages?  Are the refs there out of the kindness of the hearts?  Do you think Warrior/Adadias/Nike just give their services away to make kits?

I could go on and on but the fact of the matter is that every single person there, and I mean everybody from the custodial staff to the trainers to the players and all the way up to the owners, is there to pad their pockets. Sure, what the players/coaches do there may be their passion, but it is also their **job**.

&gt;Our football club being a well run business and winning trophies are not mutually exclusive. 

This is 100% correct. Just as with any other business, accolades help your business grow. Trophies are just a cherry, though. Getting to the CL gives us a multitude of financial opportunities.  It gives us the obvious income from the games, ticket sales, monetary rewards for placing, etc. On top of that we get further exposure in other countries that may not know/care about the club which allows us the chance to make more money by selling merchandise and tickets.

And, we become a more desirable club to play for. This means more players may be willing to come to our club for *lower* wages.  But why lower wages? Because then the next time they move clubs they can be a CL/EPL/etc. winning player, which allows them to ask for more wages.

true,iamPause,lfc68,,"I'm a numbers guy, so here is how I look at it:

Yes, LS scored 30 goals, 23 in the PL.  But for the first half of the season, who else did we have as a goal scorer? Let's not kid ourselves and say Stevie is as good as ever, because he just isn't. He is great, don't get me wrong, but he is past his prime and we need to accept that.

In January we got Daniel Sturrige. Suarez scored 23 PL goals with an entire season. DS was our number two performer with 11 (1 more than SG), and he had half as many games as Suarez, so if we look at a goals per game average, they are nearly level.

The new owners are rightfully treating this like a Moneyball situation.  So we lose Suarez and his 23 goals for a reported 46 million. That is January panic mode Torres/Carroll money. I am confident that with that amount of money we can either go out and buy a replacement **or** (more likely/fingers crossed) we can go out and buy two 15 goal players.

I know I'd like to see more options up front, and having that depth will help greatly. Especially if we go down and need someone strong to come in in the 2nd half because, again, we need to face reality and admit that we don't really have the players on the bench to mount a 2nd half comeback. We have no ""super sub.""

Losing Suarez is going to be a hit, but it won't kill us because NESV won't make the same mistake that was made with Carroll.  If Suarez goes, I have faith that the player(s) we get as a replacement will only make the team stronger in the long run.

I just hope we make these moves quickly so that the players can all get the chance to become acquainted with each other in the pre-season.

true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","A few years ago one of my job roles was 'Internet Police' for the local authority I was working for.  This was for access to the internet by council PCs which included those in the library for use by the public.  We used at the time some pretty slick software that did a number of clever things based on keywords, domains and an early version of 'cloud sourcing' (When a software admin like me added a site/keyword/keyphrase to the blacklist it was reported back to the vendor who then pushed updates out to other clients etc).  It was one of the best solutions on the market at time but at best was about 50% effective in stopping access to porn of any sort and that was when I did nothing but sit and watch the admin console.  

We had a known paedophile who used to come in and use the library systems.  His favourite method of getting around the blocks would be to search for things like 'non-nude teens' and use the libraries policy of 'no nudity' against us.  For every site I blocked access there would still be another several thousand left on altavista/google for him to get his fix from.   Having to sit and watch a Citrix session of him browsing away looking at toddlers in bikinis and shorts on the beach for police evidence made me physically sick, and I mean that in a 'someone watch this screen whilst I go vomit in the toilet' way.  

Add to this options like Tor and it's pretty unstoppable.  The paedo filth is out there and is likely never going to go away.  If  you want it bad enough you are going to be able to find it unless you live in a cave in upper bumfuckistan with no access to the outside world.    

If you think people like Mark Bridger, and the thought of abused kids doesn't outrage me you are very very wrong.  

As far as solutions go I honestly have no idea.  How do you stop someone who is likely to have hidden his/her obsession for years?  You can't deal with it if you don't know about it.  A blanket ban of Porn is not the answer there will always *always* be ways and means of getting around search and domain blocks and it pushes the worst of it further underground.

According [to this site](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats4.htm) nearly 84% of the UK's population is online.  I'll take a conservative guess that at least 25% of those look at porn online on a semi-regular basis, lets round it 13 million people.  How many of those 13 million are paedophiles and how many are lusty teenagers, lonely singles and bored married couples?  Do you ban something for the majority because of abuse by a minority?  You could apply the same argument to football and football hooliganism.

Sharia is a legal tradition for a new faith that grew up as it's own political entity thus never having the typical secular tensions. Sharia as a result is religious law but it's not the same as *the* religion and is largely open to interpretation. Because Islam was as much state as it was religion parts of that state, in this case tradition of it's laws, survived the fall of the state as part of a distributed culture.  

Which is a confusing idea I grant but the upshot is that Sharia is not really the same thing as Islam while at the same time not really being the same as the secular law we are used to. Point being that idea that muslims are less muslim for not following sharia law is more the result of extremist propaganda than an actual fact of the faith.

And, it seemed to me that the reason for their noncommittal goodbyes was to ease the pain of having to actually say 'goodbye'.  I think she said 'Spoilers' for two reasons.  Well, three if we consider that Moffat has to always have her say her signature line.  But the two which serve the story are fairly obvious to me.  First, she said, 'I was mentally linked with Clara, if she's really dead, how can I still be here?' Well, 'Spoilers' meant that Clara wasn't really dead.  River was giving The Doctor that final push he needed to go forward with his plan and leave her behind.  The second reason was, as previously mentioned, to soften the blow of the final goodbye.  Remember she asked him to say his final goodbye as if he would see her again, she was doing the same for him.  They know it's over, that's why it was so painful.  If she comes back, it severely cheapens that moment.  It makes that moment mean absolutely nothing, in fact.  She may not 'want' to die, but she knows she's dead and she has to accept that fact.

It seems he was just lobbying for interests on behalf of a country, Fiji, which by the way is a British Protectorate and so you can understand why they might want some representation within the British government, as we speak on their behalf in places like the UN (they only have a UN mission, not country status).

What do we not do? Carpet bomb the house to get rid of fleas. Guess what? Opt-in (as advocated by that stupid bitch Mensch) is the carpet bomb and the start of moral censorship on the internet.

CP and its consumers isn't tracked down by law enforcement because it's immoral (which it is anyway) but because it's illegal. It's illegal because it emotionally damages children, not because you are offended by it. 

Moral guardians love to portray incidents like this recent one as a sign of an epidemic. The fact that the murder of a five year old is so horrifying and newsworthy is a sign that it's the exact opposite, an anomaly. We do not and should not legislate based on anomalies.

&gt;**""Removing the images is by far the best way to prevent people from seeing them. It also prevents the victimisation of the abused children.”**

&gt;The IWF work closely with over 100 companies worldwide in the online industry in to remove and disrupt access to criminal images and videos.

Read the Wikipedia article. Specifically notice  the communications officer who 'mislaid' the order from  Cressida Dick  with instruction that they could allow Menezes to ""run on to Tube as [he was] not carrying anything."" 

Or in other words the police's later statements asserting he was a suicide bomber suspect are false. In fact a lot of what the police said after the incident was concluded to be 'incorrect' and supposition. 

Other irregularities that come to mind, is the use of a verbal warning ""Police, Stop or I'll shoot"" never occurred.
Menezes was sitting down and was physically removed from his seat and thrown on the floor, and then shot.
The CCTV footage for the entire incident which consisted of 3 lobby cameras and 4 platform cameras were cited as non-functioning despite Tubeline engineers stating the cameras were in full working order that day.

Episode 5: The Doctor is summoned to a portal to what the Doctor describes as “The Dark Dimension”, and they are soon caught up in a mystery. Clara and the Doctor learn more about humanity in a conflict with Whispermen. The Daily Mail complains bitterly that this episode exposes the show’s “gay agenda”. Bonnie Tyler has a cameo part.

true,Haurian,England,Kent - '10 XJ6 Diversion,"Short answer: Your local motorcycle training schools should offer a short 30m-1h taster session. CBT lets you ride on the road unsupervised, and is a day-long course.

Looooooooooong answer:
Ok. First off, your car licence means diddly squat when it comes to riding bikes, with one exception: You can ride mopeds (50cc, max 30mph by law) without L-plates after you complete your CBT.

With that out the way, onto the process for gaining your motorcycle licence, should you wish to.

As I mentioned above, you can elect to do a taster session first. As you say you've never ridden a bike before, it certainly would be an idea to do one before your CBT, as you should be able to pick up the basics about controlling a bike, which means a bit less to worry about when it comes to the CBT.

The CBT itself technically isn't a test. The abbreviation stands for Compulsory Basic Training - it's training you must undertake before you are allowed to ride on the road unsupervised. Since it's not really a test, you also technically can't fail - you'll just be told you need more training. Note that it's fairly rare for that to happen, it's only if you're really struggling or you run out of time.  
It takes the form of a full-day course. The morning is split between classroom teaching on the rules of the road and safety gear; and off-road practical training. By off-road, here we mean ""off the public highway"", not on some dirt track. Pretty much all schools have the use of a smallish pad for this - think the size of a 5-a-side football pitch. Once the instructor is happy with your control of the bike, he'll take you out on the road under one-way radio instruction. To complete the CBT, you must undertake 2 hours of road riding, with the instructor happy that you are riding in a safe manner. That's pretty much all there is to it.

Once you've got your CBT, you can now ride a 125 on your provisional entitlement. There are a couple restrictions: you must display L-plates at all times, you cannot carry pillions, you cannot use Motorways (dual carriageways are fine), and your 125 can have a maximum of 15 hp. This is fine for a while, but isn't ideal long-term. For a start, the CBT must be retaken every 2 years until gain a full licence.

Should you wish to progress to a full licence, there are 3 tests you must complete: the motorcycle theory test, and both modules of the motorcycle practical test. There is no minimum period between completing your CBT and taking your practical tests. Before we go too much further, we should discuss the various licence types available.  
First off is AM - Mopeds only. Only 16-year-olds who want to carry pillions need complete this, mopeds aren't allowed on motorways under any circumstances.  
Second is A1. This has the same cc/power restrictions as the provisional licence, but you're allowed to carry pillions and use motorways. It's the only test you're able to take if you're 17 or 18, and, like the AM, is only of benefit if you *need* to use motorways or carry pillions.  
Third, we have the A2. If you're over 19 but under 24, this is what you'll be looking at. There is no cc restriction, but you have a maximum power allowance of 35kW(~47bhp). You may restrict more powerful bikes to that value, but only if their original power does not exceed 70kW(~93bhp). This allows you to ride a bike with plenty of power for everyday riding, while not allowing the 600/1000cc Race Replicas.  
Finally, we have the unrestricted A category. As you might guess, this allows you to ride any motorcycle with no restrictions. This test can be taken as Direct Access (DAS) if you're over 24, otherwise you must hold a A2 licence for 2 years before you can take the tests.

The Theory test is easy enough, it's very similar to what you'd have done for your car licence. However, there are a number of questions which are motorcycle-specific, so familiarising yourself with these is recommended. This can be completed at any time, but like the CBT, is valid for 2 years, in which time you must pass both practical tests. If you cannot for whatever reason, both the theory and Mod1 (if passed) must be retaken. The theory test need not be taken again if upgrading a licence (e.g. A1 to A2, or A2 to A).

Onto the practical tests then. This is split into two modules, imaginatively named Module 1 and Module 2. Mod1 consists of a number of manoeuvres taken on an off-road testing centre, including a U-turn, figure-of-8 and emergency stop.  
Module 2 is an observed road ride, of around half an hour to 45 minutes. In this, you will need to perform a couple manoeuvres not possible on the off-road test pad (hill start and angle start), but for the most part is just about riding safely. There is a section of independent riding (if you took your car test recently, it's much the same), but the focus is primarily on the safety of your riding, not following instructions. You cannot be faulted for not following instructions, providing you do so safely, as it's entirely possible you are unable to hear them. The examiner may get slightly annoyed if you ignore him excessively, though.",0,1370012151,null,0,false,0,ca9i0ov,t3_1feka1,t1_ca9i0ov,t3_1feka1,null,1430972751,9,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,9

Feels harsh as I didn't access any patient or business data, but at the end of the day I was an idiot and did access files I shouldn't have, so I have to deal with that and rebuild some semblance of a reputation. I don't think it likely that I can get back into an IT role any time soon...

JUST IN CASE there's someone on here in the Portsmouth area looking for an IT guy and willing to give a guy who screwed up a chance:

I agree, but it is very, very hard to calculate the effect a player has just by being on the pitch. How many of Luis' second season goals came because of Sturridge? We just don't know, but what we can calculate are things like assists; Luis has 6, Sturridge has 5.  If we combine goals per game with assists per game, this puts Sturridge far, far ahead of Luis.

Granted, we can break this down and say that Sturridge's assists came because of Luis (I don't know how many of those were to Suarez) but still, that's an interesting statistic to take note of.

Suarez is a great player. His ball control is fantastic and he has a killer instinct and that is great, but imho I'd rather have consistency. I want a team that can score from anywhere near the box and doesn't have to rely on one player beating 4 defenders with 3 nutmegs to score.

They don't care individually what you think. But they do care what you and the 2 million other 18-24 year olds (once you turn 18) think. But *only* if they expect that you will turn out for the vote.

Just look at the lib dems. They were languishing in obscurity but they managed to make there way into a coalition thanks *at least in part* to their popularity with young people and students as well as lots of other people being completely sick of labour and conservatives.

Lib dems aren't so popular now, and labour and the conservatives are no more popular, so who knows, in the next elections, even more small parties can come to the fore. This may include parties that you and I hate, like UKIP, but I still applaud the fact that we aren't stuck with only two or three invincible parties.

Every time we as the young voters manage to push a new party to prominence, they may (even probably) will disappoint us but so what? We'll vote in another one next time! We may go through 10 shitty parties and candidates before we find a good one, but there is still a chance we will find that good one.

If we give up hope and stop voting, then nothing will change. The same parties will do the same thing ad infinitum. If we vote, things may stay the same but there's a chance, no matter how small, that we can find someone better. Isn't it worth taking a few minutes of our lives to vote? Just for that small chance?

I'm typing rather a lot and it may seem a pointless waste of time.

true,thashicray,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"This article aside I do believe the almost entirely uncontrolled access to the vast amounts of pornography over the internet is a huge issue. Over masturbation leads to an inability to be intimate and confirmation of inane fantasies that would seldom happen and thus contribute to watching more porn upon seeing there are few people out there who wish to fulfill them.

I could go on about the over reliance of certain people into this virtually deviant world but the point is there are those out there who can reach a decent, happy medium in their indulgences. But because certain problems like this are very personal those who do suffer do not wish to seek help on the most part they continue to suffer.

It sounds rather like a gargantuan first world problem but I would say there needs to be a certain amount of regulation in the face of the vast amounts of and varieties of this internet pornography colossus. Violent pornography is an issue but the ease had by those who would prefer to engage with virtual pleasure rather than physical even in the soft core sense of it, will still be considered by myself as an issue.

""You're taking away our rights!"", well, it seems that if we cannot control ourselves and from a young age are witness to this XXX plethora then what will this do to future generations? There was a wonderful book on the subject: Men, Women and children by Chad Kultgen which touches upon the issue of 'over masturbation.'

Having had a close friend, who rather reluctantly came out with this problem to me the other day has made me think rather deeply about this particular issue and what will happen with the next couple of decades because of it. He was embaressed and it seemed (without my knowledge) felt he had wasted a signification portion his life on the internet looking at this crud instead of going out and meeting girls or even interacting with people. ""First it was because it was easy and then it became hard to avoid, it was the only place I felt confident"" were his words.

Looking at pictures of doner kebabs, they seem to look a lot like what we would just refer to offhand as a pita, though the vertical spit isn't a part of the experience. In my city (it's different across the country) we enjoy pizza, cheeseburgers or a burrito to round out the night. Mornings are usually met with a large breakfast or a massive (and cheap) Filipino buffet. Recently we tried to combine the burger and the pizza into one meal, though it has a distinct Frankenstein vibe to it and everyone is a bit nervous to try it out.

Second of all, the first half of the season suarez was the ONLY dependable striker we had.  Borini did next to nothing then got broke his toe, came back and dislocated his shoulder.  Not to mention Borinis only goal in the league came against a piss poor newcastle. And when suarez couldnt play, what happened?  We played Jonjo Shelvey up front.

So without suarez, no striker would have scored a goal in the league until sturridge came in. Which was partly the club's fault in not brining in other strikers, but no way in hell would we had done nearly as well thise season without him those first 20 games.

Also, saying you're proud of it is essentially saying that you thought it was a good thing. 

It's fine to be proud that we *have* a long and interesting history unlike some countries, it's fine to admire what was required to build and maintain such an empire and the achievements of the heroes that fought in it. However, to say that you are proud of the Empire means that you agree with it or thought it was a good thing. 

I'm by no means ashamed of the British Empire, and I really do admire what went into building it, there were some heroic battles and huge social, economic and logistical issues that were overcome, a massive feat!

I never said they wouldn't have to borrow money -- that after all is the big mistake that a lot of people make about deficit reduction -- they forget that we are still borrowing more, not less.

I most certainly am aware of that.

The expectation I put, which was totally different is that Labour would be borrowing more to fund spending on top of existing plans, but I am worried that they haven't costed whether such increased borrowing can be repaid through the expected increased economic output.

If you borrow £100 billion to spend on things, but it generates a long term net economic gain of just £75 billion -- then that was a bad idea.

It's like when Ed Balls calls for a cut in VAT. Which would be a great idea if he can also show that a £20 billion reduction in direct VAT revenues is offset by higher tax revenues elsewhere.

&gt;Internet pornography is sometimes abusive and often violent

No shit Sherlock. Is this what passes as decent journalism these days? It's on par with stating some car accidents end in death. Or alcohol sometimes makes people think they're harder than they actually are.

The ""A sunny side to smut"" link that they refer to states

&gt;The most common concern about pornography is that it indirectly hurts women by encouraging sexism, 

It directly hurts me when I realise that the plumber has a bigger length of pipe than I have. That doesn't make it a bad thing. 

Anyway back to this fine specimen of crafted language
 
&gt;But there is strong evidence that at the very least it is addictive, can normalise violence, and at the same time diminishes sympathy for its victims.

Strong evidence that porn is addictive? Seriously? Really? Honestly? Next they'll be telling us that drugs are bad kids. 

Diminishes sympathy for its victims? They're ACTING. Why should anybody feel any sympathy for anybody that CHOOSES OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL TO GET THEIR KIT OFF AND SHAG ON CAMERA?????

&gt;David Cameron has taken a keen interest

I bet he has the dirty fecker. I dread to think who's the plug and who's the socket between him and Nick.

&gt;seems reluctant to lead

Ah, there's our answer. He's the socket. 

&gt;A law banning extreme porn was introduced in 2009, 

There we go. Extreme porn is banned. Thus diminishing the modicum of respect that article could have gained from even the most ardent Diana loving Guardian reader.

&gt;Meanwhile, the market sinks lower and lower, from the glumly predictable announcement this week of a porn app for Google Glass, 

A company that has no connection to porn provides people the ability to get hold of porn and that's somehow an indication that the market for porn is sinking lower?

&gt;to a ""revenge porn"" site where stolen images of women were posted and the victims required to pay to get them removed. 

Oh please. Images of MEN and women were not stolen. They were sent via email, text message, carrier pigeon and post. People just decided to share them. 

&gt;But there are ways of introducing a de facto bar – for example, preventing UK credit cards being used on such porn sites. 

Never heard of Paypal? 

&gt;But the misery of the April Jones case should spur a revival of the effort.

Only the lowest journalist could heartlessly use and abuse the death of a child in order to try and justify banning abusive porn.
