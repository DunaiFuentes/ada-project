I asked why say it? What purpose does it serve for you? Why say something that is only hurting the family of the dead person, why is your random want to complain overriding the feelings of a bereaved family?

Calling someone selfish for killing themselves like that is like calling someone an asshole for dying of cancer. It's an illness, the reason they are so selfish is that their illness causes their thinking to change. They can't control it. If you want to be the guy or girl who calls a sick person selfish for being sick, for no reason other to have a whinge, then go for it.

As for all of your other examples:

- Corrupt politicians? Not relevant as something can be done about corruption. Calling someone selfish does not prevent others from doing the same thing as there is no rational thought involved.

- Why does the media print articles about paedophiles? Because the media in general reports on crime to inform the public about who has done what. Paedophiles are a potential future danger, a dead person isn't.

- Why do I need to point out suicidal people aren't thinking rationally? To try and changes the attitudes of people like you who talk about it as though it is some sort of rational choice and not a symptom of their illness over which they have no control.

None of your examples are equivalent because they either serve a purpose (information) or relate to things which can be changed.

(Maybe fresh, unworldly Americans, I dunno.)

Most faith-based orgs are there to show, demonstrate and build relationships through helping people. (Cause if you care, you help.) So for example, my wife's a doctor and I'm a techie - so we worked at a desert hospital, where I tried to fix stuff and she tried to fix people.

It's hard to articulate ""how Christian or not it is"", because I really think it's so far removed from our concepts here of what that means. In our case in west Africa, it was saturated in faith but more by doing than by talking. It perhaps depends if, like us, you're working in a majority non-Christian country or not.

FWIW, we had folk come out and visit us who weren't Christian, and seemed to get on just fine. No-one's going to hold you down and feather you until you confess...

You might find some organisations might quietly warn you about going out with them if you're not Christian - for your own comfort, as much as those you'd be working with. Kinda depends where you're going/how explicit the ministry is. But if you're open-minded it might not be an issue for you.

I guess you haven't actually read my post, then.

&gt; I asked why say it? What purpose does it serve for you? 

I mention this forum of comments and opinion because the question you ask there could apply to any of it. You don't know me. You will probably never meet me. So why say these things to me? What purpose does it serve you? Why has *anyone* posted in this thread? 

&gt; Why say something that is only hurting the family of the dead person, why is your random want to complain overriding the feelings of a bereaved family?

Are the family of the dead person here in this thread? Am I seeking them out and saying it to them personally, as though I have some personal vendetta against the deceased and them? 

No. 

&gt; Calling someone selfish for killing themselves like that is like calling someone an asshole for dying of cancer. 

It's really not though, is it. A person can die of cancer without drawing others into their death. Their family and friends are of course affected - but it ends there. Public suicide by vehicle is different in this way. 

You do raise one good point; I wonder if there has been a study into why people choose certain methods for their suicide. Some use poison, others a gun, others a moving train or car. I wonder how they decide which is most appropriate - is it pre-meditated, instinctive or crazed? 

&gt; Corrupt politicians? Not relevant as something can be done about corruption. 

True, but complaining about it here does nothing. 

&gt; Paedophiles are a potential future danger, a dead person isn't.

And yet in the act of killing themselves, a suicidal person might scar a train driver or other bystanders for life. You don't seem to care about that, though. 

I appreciate - again - that you may have been touched by this subject. You speak passionately of it. But your concern clearly begins and ends with the suicidal person and their immediate relatives. What you constantly overlook are all the other people - possibly in the hundreds or thousands - who might also be affected by the act.

&gt;It's really not though, is it. A person can die of cancer without drawing others into their death. Their family and friends are of course affected - but it ends there. Public suicide by vehicle is different in this way.

It is really though. Dying of cancer is one of the symptoms of cancer. Having an altered thought pattern is a major symptom of depression - a person who may the least selfish person of all time could still kill themselves in this way. Would they deserve to have the label of ""selfish"" attached to them for succumbing to a symptom of the illness they have? Forget who it affects, do you agree or not that the selfishness could at least be partly if not wholly attributed to their illness? And if you do agree, do you think it is fair to assign that personality trait to someone who killed themself?

&gt;And yet in the act of killing themselves, a suicidal person might scar a train driver or other bystanders for life. You don't seem to care about that, though.

It is so frustrating when someone purposely misses your point to try and make theirs. This doesn't even refer to my point. Reporting on paedophiles serves a public purpose as it publicises that person X is a paedophile, reporting that suicidal people are selfish does what exactly? The paedophile may reoffend so learning about them is useful. The dead person is dead.

&gt;But your concern clearly begins and ends with the suicidal person and their immediate relatives.

Again more proof you just aren't interested in my point. You claim to care about the victims, but what purpose or benefit to the other people involved does it have to label the person so sick they killed themselves selfish? None. Why not show some compassion for the family, and for the ill person whose sickness causes them to make decisions they certainly wouldn't make normally? Why is it hurtful to the other victims to say what I am saying? It is emotive language designed to try and make me seem uncaring, but when thought about is actually completely pointless to the debate.

I would also like to say I am frankly insulted by your complete straw man attack that I don't care about the other victims. It is a false argument you made up to try and make me seem unreasonable. If you can find where I have said this, please post it, otherwise please apologise and admit your mistake. There is a difference between saying that something does not help the victims and is therefore pointless, and saying that the victims deserve no sympathy.

If the state don't defend private property from rioters, and don't have any legal and financial responsibility for the private property lost, how can they maintain the prohibition on private individuals, companies and insurers forming their own police force, rather than having to rely on security officers who can only call a police force that doesn't come to help?

I know the distinction between regular criminal damages and criminal damage in a riot may seem spurious to some, but I would disagree.

C. S. Forester's, Hornblower novels and Patrick O'Brian's, Aubry/Maturin series (remember the movie, ""Master and Commander?"") are incomparable examples of RN history during the Napoleonic period. 

I heartily recommend them to you if you enjoy accurate historical novels. Plenty of adventure and wonderful slice-of-life settings. Both authors relied heavily upon the RN's archive of logs, journals, and report, and official letters, as well as first hand accounts in memoirs and autobiographies.

If you're a fan of audio books, I recommend the Patrick Tull's narration of the Aubry/Maturin novels. There's another fellow who has done the set, but I find his characterizations more fitting to an episode of Wodehouse Playhouse or ""You Rang M'Lord?""

true,[deleted],null,null,"A good sample of answers already, but I'll add mine. When I was in a bank myself, I was an IT contractor (not a permanent employee). I was self-employed, and charged accordingly (£450 per day - the lowest rate for an inexperienced contractor). A lot of money, but as soon as they need to downsize, the contractors get the boot. You are paid to be highly expendable, and my contract was only for 6 months (then the contract would be terminated).

So high compensation, but very low job security. As it turned out, they extended me for another 6 months, and wanted more, but I left to go permanent elsewhere.

My job was fairly dull. I worked 9-5. When I got in, the permanent staff were all there. They were there when I left. I was discouraged from working extra hours (overtime rate on £450 per day gets expensive for the people paying it) though I did once go in at 3am on a Sunday morning to help out the Japanese office with a test of a system I had been working on.

The permanent staff worked much longer hours and got paid less - not a *lot* less, it must be said - because their bonuses were *amazing* if they put in the hours. 

When you hear of massive City bonuses (""Bank X pay out £80 million in bonuseses!!eleven!!shock!!one!!"") remember that's *all* employee bonuses. All of them. They work there, and they work those long hours *for the bonus*. They don't get paid overtime. It's the *bonus* (and most places will factor in the hours you worked when calculating your share).

That includes the lowest salaried jobs, probably - junior secretaries and so forth. If they get paid (say) £20k a year (almost enough to live on in London) and then get a £10k bonus at year-end, they are comfortable. Add up 1,000 secretaries and you've just accounted for 1,000,000 of that bonus pot. Then the more senior staff and so forth.

At the top the bonuses *are* massive for some individuals, but the news never tell you about those thousand secretaries and everyone in between, who have worked 70-hour weeks all year.

My friends who worked as permanent staff all had similar stories: long hours, poor social life, but good money. Some stayed with it, others left to do nicer but lower-paid jobs.

Shouting is not unheard of (but never happened to me), and politics is a massive element of the job there if you get senior. To the extent that major IT projects will fail (or so I hear) because each head of (the multiple and independent) IT departments insist that their favourite design is best, so nobody will ever sign off the design of anyone else - lest *they* get the bonus.

I've seen some seriously poor IT in these places (I still work in the sector, just not at a bank). Shockingly poor. But you can't fix the issues. Oh, no. Because that would be too political.

My favourite story was from a (female) friend. She was criticised by her boss for ""not being political enough"" and that she should ""not be so feminine, but more ruthless"".  Anyway, she saw his boss in the canteen (funny how she went for lunch the same time he did), and she mentioned it in passing, and how she thought her performance spoke for itself and she didn't really have time for any bullshit, and his comments had vaguely annoyed her. Perhaps they could even be construed as sexist. But obviously, she would never hold it against the company, where she quite liked working. Just that guy and his ""way"". *sigh*.  Then she dropped the subject.  All off the record, naturally. Just casual chit-chat.

That afternoon, as she saw her boss walk out of his boss' office looking quite stunned, she smiled sweetly, and said: ""was that political enough for you?""

He never mentioned politics to her again. Just admired how smoothly her department seemed to get the job done when other departments seemed to hit these mysterious barriers...",0,1379007104,null,0,false,0,cc6zavl,t3_1m8i59,t1_cc6zavl,t1_cc6t4ro,null,1429487867,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

There are no buses, job centre will send you to compete against those in the local town and the jobs in the local village seem to go family members and their friends in the pubs etcetera due to nepotism.

&gt; nor do I have any sympathy for Southern Rail and their 'rolling stock issues'

Many TOCs have rolling stock issues. They lease their rolling stock, which is allocated by the DfT and there's only a certain amount of it and some is out of shape, due to not building enough in years go by. Everyone's trying to play catch up but with railway use still growing that's a steep hill to climb. There's also the question of money. Network Rail has to upgrade the network to accomodate more trains. To do this quicker would cost more money and I think it's fair to say most people would prefer fares didn't go up even more.

&gt; for a company that is turning over £100 million profit

Do you have a source for that? For info, TOCs only make 3% profit on income after all costs.

&gt; buses being a pretty simple answer

Fair point but I don't know if they can just magic up dozens of busses and then navigate through traffic quicker than to just have you wait an hour. Unless they lease busses and put them permenantly on standby, which means costs/fares increase.

&gt; walls between track and platform akin to the ones we see on the tube

Putting aside the butt ugliness, that would cost and in my view would be mostly pointless. If people are determined (for want of a better word) enough then they'll use a bridge, level crossing or any track access instead.

true,rhiscott21,null,null,"I tend not to post on Reddit but I do feel like I should add my bit here because my job is assessing homeless applications for a UK local authority, so I essentially live and breathe all things housing-related. I interview over 2500 applicants each year, and would estimate that I go through 6 months of bank statements of around 1000 of those people, meaning I have an excellent idea about what people spend their money on. 

There are many comments on this thread which are excellent and insightful, and then there are the usual which appear to be made by people that have never worked in this area or have a friend of a friend who has told them lots of stories about the feckless. 

The Telegraph article is slightly confusing in that it seems to suggest that the reason for this increase in evictions is purely related to increasing levels of rent arrears. 

We have seen a huge increase in the number of people/ households we get approaching as facing homelessness, and it has been particularly noticeable in the past month or so, but what I can safely say is that the majority of people are NOT evicted for rent arrears, even following the bedroom tax. Most people desperately fight to keep a roof over their head, and understand that the rent comes before luxuries. 

The reason evictions are going up at the moment (and landlords and agencies are telling us this themselves) is because they are exceptionally anxious about the benefit changes that are coming, and most believe that Universal Credit will be put in place come October (it was supposed to be, it won't). This is despite the fact that 7/10 housing benefits claimants are in employment. What does that tell you about wages in this country compared to living costs? 

It will soon be almost impossible for housing benefit to be paid direct to them, pretty much the only bargaining tool we have at the moment for them to actually take on HB claimants.  

When somebody makes a homeless application, the likelihood is they won't get helped because they have to pass five 'tests' as it were:

-Eligible, Homeless, Priority Need, Not intentionally homeless, and have a local connection. 

Most will fall at the priority need hurdle, and some are found intentionally homeless. We investigate and tear into every aspect of their life, leaving no stone unturned in case we dare help somebody who doesn't pass these tests. 

Most people we get coming in are NOT homeless through any fault of their own. I cannot say this loudly enough. They're just unlucky enough to have been evicted or have lost their accommodation, and don't have the funds to find somewhere else. It is terrifying how easily somebody can become street homeless, with no safety net to catch them. I've seen it happen to people from every background. 

To those who honestly believe these situations are usually avoidable, please, let me give you just a few scenarios that I came across just today alone (I appreciate this is lengthy, apologies).

-Chap 1. Was living in a studio flat costing £600pcm (lower than average for our area). This was entirely affordable while he was working. He was made redundant, went onto job seeker's allowance, and found that he would only get a maximum of £290pcm in housing benefit. He used all of the savings he had to ensure that he didn't fall into rent arrears while he desperately looked for somewhere else, but then didn't have the £1000+ sum that most landlords or agencies want round here before they will allow you to move in. He fell into rent arrears anyway because very few agencies or landlords will touch you if you're on housing benefit, and so he was evicted. He wasn't a priority need, and he'll be sleeping on the street tonight, where he was last night, because the only shelter in our area has had it's funding removed entirely and has closed. He has no friends who are able to take him in, and his family don't have the room to accommodate him either. 

-Woman 1. Took a retraining order out against her ex-partner who threatened to murder their child when she ended their relationship. He, to put it in no uncertain terms, kicked the shit out of her, and yet SHE is the one who has to leave everything she has and flee out of area, only to live in a dump of a B&amp;B because there are no suitable refuge spaces available. Her child was supposed to start primary school this week. 

-Chap 2. Has serious mental health problems after long periods of childhood sexual abuse whilst in care as a child. Can no longer live independently because his depression is so bad that he is too frightened to get out of the house, but has just about been coping. Adult social care say he is not high need enough for them because he can toilet and shower himself. He has had three suicide attempts in the past month. Landlord is evicting him because he can get more rent for the (complete shit hole) of a property from somebody who is in work. This is the landlord who owns and makes an absolute killing from the 15 properties he owns in out area. 

-Woman 2. Has lived in her private rented house for three years and loves it there. the landlord says she has been an excellent tenant, but they want their daughter to move into the house now that she has finished university. 

Of course, you'll always get idiots who spend their money on drugs, on booze, or Sky TV, but then you never do hear about the ones who rely on food banks just to feed their child because the only landlord who would take them on charges them £250+ over the housing benefit rate. Or those who live in a rural area and have to spend £20 a week out of their pittance JSA just to get to the JobCentre or to town to look for work/ attend interviews. Or those who who have never been taught to manage their lives or finances properly, and rather than being offered help to start doing it are instead sneered at by people who were fortunate enough to be taught these often taken for granted skills. 

I do see these people, and as I said, I analyse their bank statements. 

Please believe me when I say that things are horrific at the moment- I have never seen so many unhappy, unwell, and fucking exhausted people coming in. They are tired of everything, tired of life, and things are set to get worse. 

I always say that there are three things that stop a person ending up on the street:

-Savings, which is dependent on having been able to get settled period of work.

-Good friends and family support networks with space to accommodate you. No prizes for understanding why for many people, this isn't an option or a reality. 

-A job, which not only means that you at least have a bit of income coming in and an agency is more likely to take you on, if you can afford the extortionate fees of course.

This generation gets its information from the internet, which has a massive number of sources of varying quality and respectability, but the information you get from that mechanism is obviously going to be much more inclusive of everything that is going on, as oppose to the very easily controlled content of TV.

As far as i understand it, that's all that's going on.  If you get your information from a closed system with its own interests, your going to naturally 'become' part of that narrowed mindset.

If you look at his build, he's a pretty underweight guy as far as premier league CB's go. Take the price we paid into consideration as well, we didn't buy Ilori to ride the pine behind our more experienced CB's. 

If you look in his past he's been a striker as a youth, moved back to a midfield role, and eventually broke into a few starts for Lisbon as a central defender.

Given his closing speed (rumored to be faster than Nani and CR7 clocked at Lisbon), arial ability, experience defending, and that he looks comfortable on the ball (on YouTube) I think he may be cover for Lucas. 

Two more things for the nay-sayers. One, Joe Allen was never brought in to be cover for Lucas as a DM.

I'd just like to point out that there are *many* experts in education, and they are pulling in a variety of directions. Educational theories are just that - theories, in the layman's sense of the word. There is very little hard science in education, and the results of studies can be very easily corrupted.

The biggest problem with young kids right now is that many are entering school **without being able to talk**. This is a new thing, this is not propaganda and it is a serious problem. The main idea as to the cause is the amount of internet usage keeping parents messaging friends rather than verbally communicating with their toddlers, but the exact cause isn't secured. Many schools are now having to teach these kids to communicate, which is generally a new issue as I said and prevents anything else being worked on before this is achieved.

So what I'm saying is, don't assume the truth from the headline. I'm not saying Gove is right or wrong because I don't know, I'm but a teacher in training, but it's not a black and white issue and we don't know what other expert advice he is hearing.

true,straordinaria,null,null,"I was with ClickLet for a year (2011-12.) We had some issues - I would probably use them again if the flat was nice enough, but my three flatmates said they wouldn't.

A few things to keep an eye on: they were awful at giving us advance notice on viewings (and then had the audacity to send an email asking us to clean up when they were showing the flat!), and took a chunk out of the deposit without justification - the agent had even said at the exit inspection that we shouldn't have any problems. An extract from our emails to them after moving out:

&gt; *""The stains on the hall carpet were marked on the inventory upon our arrival in the flat and it was indicated in the inventory that the hallway carpet was in a poor condition.  Under no circumstances is this something which we should be billed for - if anything, the carpet should have been cleaned prior to our moving in the flat!*

&gt; *In regards to the replacement of the lightbulbs, I was not aware that there were lightbulbs in the hallway needing replaced but object to the charge of £14.00 for four lightbulbs.  As I'm sure you are aware, the spotlight bulbs which were required for the hallway can be purchased for as little as £1 per bulb in ASDA (I have just checked) and therefore oppose being charged more than £4 for the four.  I won't even touch upon the fact that your cleaning company charge £45 an hour for some light cleaning.*

&gt; *What I perhaps object most to, however, is that fact that your agency have the cheek to charge £25 for your ""time"" when the deposit took over 30 days to be returned to us, as opposed to the 14 days stated in the contract.  Your communication with us was appalling (as it was throughout the tenancy); recently I recall even reading an email to one of the other tenants in which you complain about the lack of communication between tenants.  As far as I was aware, the job of the letting agency was to keep all of the tenants informed as well as the landlord.  It is simply not feasible for the four of us (who are now living separately) to forward details of every communication we receive from you between us.""*

true,rzam,lfc68,,"As a lot of you have pointed out, he definitely looks to have the raw athleticism to play in that role, but I think it's really premature to speculate at all about where he'll play and how he'll play there until we've actually seen him in action. People think DMs and CBs are interchangeable, but the fact is that's just not the case and it depends on the player. Mascherano and Busquets, for example, have the raw strength to cope at the back (and the experience playing there at different stages in their careers, not to mention that they also play for a team and in a league that stylistic allows them to fulfill that role). Lucas, meanwhile, doesn't look like the kind of player who would really excel if we placed him back there, and almost certainly not in the Premier League -- his defensive attributes lie mainly in his timing and anticipation, while he's no weakling he's certainly not Agger or Toure in terms of strength, and in terms of experience he actually started out as an attacking midfielder at Gremio. Ilori certainly looks a very versatile player, and I can't wait to see him play, but I think we should be patient -- he's only 20, looks quite light physically, and most importantly has never played as a CB in England. 

The Anfield Wrap guys have pointed this out when talking about Coates: CB is a very difficult position for a young player to play. First, there's a much slimmer margin for error -- if Raheem Sterling or Jordan Ibe make a mistake in the final third (like misplacing a pass or failing to pick out an obvious one), we'll all groan, chalk it up to growing pains and move on. If Ilori or Andre Wisdom are playing CB though, and they make a mistake and give the ball away in our own half, it could very likely be the difference in the match's outcome. The position demands tons of experience to fully grasp, which is why Sakho is so valuable (having played so much at his age) and why you often don't see CBs come into their own until their mid-to-late 20s; players need games, and circumstances very often don't provide young defenders with the patience or opportunities required to grow into the position. The only quality young CB in England I can think of who's getting regular first team action *in his natural position* is Matija Nastasic at Man City, and he looks to be a hell of a player and the exception rather than the rule (even Phil Jones can't break the Ferdinand-Vidic partnership at United).

I see Ilori as one for the future, along with the likes of Suso, Teixeira, Sterling, Ibe, Alberto and Wisdom. Hopefully he comes along well enough to factor into the squad this season -- as Sterling, Ibe, Alberto and Wisdom have -- but we know Rodgers has a passion for developing young players and, especially when you factor in a 21 year old Coutinho, we look to have a very, very, very promising crop of them for the future (in the case of Suso and Teixeira in particular, you only hope they come along well enough to actually factor and don't drift off into Loan Purgatory like Dani Pacheco). That being said, we're deep enough at the back to allow the kid a couple months to get used to the club and the pace/physicality of the English game, and should not expect so much from him so soon -- and that includes throwing him straight into the engine room as a defensive midfielder in the Premier League, one of the most challenging roles a player could have.

That being said, I think your chart (and this thread at large) highlights **a more interesting discussion to be had: the merits at large of the squad at our disposal.** The transfer window is (thankfully) a memory, we've brought in eight new players, we've taken ~~12 out of the opening 12~~ 9 out of the opening 9 points and the guys we have now are the guys we're going to war with (at least until January) in our quest to bring Champions League football back to Anfield. **What do you think about *squad* we have? Where, and how, do you think they'll play within the formations and tactics that Rodgers and his staff have implemented (or look to implement)? Where do you think we still need to strengthen, in order for this side to reach its full potential?**",0,1379014067,null,0,1379086536,0,cc71zhr,t3_1m9bwi,t1_cc71zhr,t3_1m9bwi,null,1429486544,20,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,20

true,voilavoila,null,null,"Part 2:

At first I was wary about this level of involvement with management. I had been used to talking with Dad when he was assistant manager at West Ham and remember him coming home on a few occasions telling stories of players trying to tell him and Harry their job. 

‘We had that so-and-so in the office today,’ he would say, ‘telling us we should buy this player and that player. Who the fuck does he think he is?’ 

I seem to remember Paolo Di Canio’s name being mentioned a lot in these conversations. This was a very different culture from what we were used to – maybe Paolo was accustomed to it but for John and me, being asked to give an opinion on everything was completely new. 

Team food also changed. We had been accustomed to a strict diet of pasta, salad, fish, and chicken with nothing sweet or ‘unhealthy’ – now we had all of those things but also cookies for dessert and even Coca-Cola. Players appreciate being treated as adults, and Mourinho gives you the option: you can take the right route or the wrong route – but if you take the wrong route, he will know about it and there will be repercussions. 

Some people chose to see how far they could push him. Hernan Crespo failed to turn up on time for the first day’s training despite the fact Mourinho had called him to assure him that he was first-choice striker. A deal was quickly agreed to send him on loan to AC Milan. Everyone was well aware of what had happened. A line had been drawn and above it was an important message: Don’t mess with the manager. Those who crossed the line found their career at Chelsea short-lived. Veron and Mutu were two other high-profile signings from the previous year who didn’t survive. Seba went on loan to Inter Milan and never came back while Adrian was already well on his way to going off the rails. 

Ironically, Mourinho had decided to get rid of him until Crespo pissed him off and so Mutu was granted a reprieve. He had arrived as part of the Abramovich revolution and seemed like a decent lad even though sometimes he had that ‘can’t be bothered’ attitude about him. In the first few games of the 2003/04 season he looked very impressive, showing an ability to score goals with either foot. He had a bit of front about him as well, a cheek which came through in the presence of people he wanted to impress or get attention from. The most obvious was Mr Abramovich. When he came into the dressing room after games most players were respectful and friendly towards the owner of the club. Mutu behaved differently. 

‘Ah boss, boss!!’ he would shout as soon as he saw him. 

‘How’s that yacht sailing? I mean yachts,’ and he would laugh loudly until he saw Mr Abramovich break into a smile. Quite often Mutu would usher Mr Abramovich into a corner where they would chat more quietly. I have no idea what they talked about but it seemed friendly enough. This was shortly after the buy out of the club and I think the new owner enjoyed being treated like one of the boys though I could tell from the way he looked at Mutu that he knew exactly what was going on. Quite often Mutu would bring up the subject of bonuses for the players and Roman would smile at him even though it was a bit embarassing. 

I’m sure he had rarely come across anyone like Mutu before, or at least anyone like him that he directly employed. It was hardly the most subtle way to ask for a raise but to Mutu it was all part of a big act. He loved that – he was an extrovert who was rarely content if he wasn’t the focus of attention. Despite his fooling around, Mutu was also a clever politician when it came to selecting the people he would befriend. 

I didn’t talk to him much but Mutu certainly made a point of singling out the players he felt had influence. Marcel, JT, and Franco were people I would often see him chatting with about the team, the way we were playing, and so on. He was cute that way. When he won Romania’s Player of the Year there was a private plane to ferry him to Bucharest for the ceremony and he invited Marcel, JT, and Mario Melchiot along for the night out. It was interesting to see him work the dressing room. We had a couple of team outings and Mutu would turn up in his urban terrorist gear wearing enough chains around his neck to give most gangsta rappers a run for their rhyme-gotten gains. It didn’t stop there. He was happy to find a podium or posing post in the club where he could watch everyone around him watch him. I stayed near the relative sanity of the bar chatting with a few mates but before you knew it Mutu, smoking a big cigar, had taken over a table and was surrounded by women. ‘Lamps! Lamps! Come to the table,’ he shouted over. I just thought, ‘This lad knows how to live.’ It’s fair to say Adrian liked to party. I didn’t think much of it then because he was still new at Chelsea and playing well. There was nothing to suggest he wouldn’t be a valuable addition to the squad, but then his form dropped quite quickly and the goals dried up. Then he was injured and only appeared very irregularly in the team. During that time Mutu’s social life began to get out of hand. He seemed drawn to excess – it was evident in the way he behaved around people – and the story of his two cars is a good illustration of his careless attitude when it came to his reputation. 

He bought two Porsche 911s when he signed for the club – a blue one he used to come to training in during the week, and a black one which he preferred for weekends. 

Unfortunately, his apartment in Chelsea Harbour only came with one parking space and so he took to parking the one he wasn’t using on a yellow line outside, knowing it would be impounded. At the end of the week, he would give one of the trainee pros the four hundred quid or so needed to get his car out of the pound and bring it back to Chelsea Harbour. This went on for a few weeks before someone at the club got wind of it and told Mutu to sort it out before it became a story for the tabloids. When a high-profile footballer is behaving like that it’s only a matter of time before they will make the headlines. Mutu was a scandal waiting to happen. 

Scott Parker lived near Mutu at Chelsea Harbour for a while. Scottie is the ultimate professional – never late and always well prepared – but on occasion he would travel to Harlington with Mutu. One morning he bumped into Mutu as he was coming out of the lift in their building. Mutu looked rough and had obviously enjoyed a good night – so good, he was just getting in. He begged Scottie to wait for him while he got changed into his training gear. Scottie agreed as long as he was straight back down and amazingly Mutu appeared and the two of them made it on time. 

It wasn’t the first time Mutu had come straight from a night out to the training ground. The lads started noticing that he would manage half a session or less and then complain that he felt a muscle strain or another minor injury. He’d head into the dressing room struggling from a lack of energy and nothing else. 

I had seen it before with Mark Bosnich who had drifted out of the team and lost interest in training and playing. He started hanging around with a certain crowd in a particular social scene and had changed as a person. I had always got on well with Bozo but it got to the stage when I didn’t recognize the one-time happy-go-lucky guy who used to give me a lift to training when I first signed. I never knew for sure that he was doing cocaine and never actually saw him take drugs, but when you come in from training and find your reserve goalie fast asleep on the massage table fully dressed you realize something is wrong. He wasn’t knackered from exercise and it got so bad that I even remember having a conversation with Ranieri while Bozo snored in the background. 

It was the same with Mutu in that I didn’t know for sure he was using cocaine. I had heard a couple of rumours about it and noticed he was becoming more and more erratic. It was obvious that he was more interested in playing the field than playing on it. His mood became changeable – one day he would look very rough and blank you; the next he would be fine and as boisterous as ever. When the story leaked that he had tested positive for cocaine I wasn’t exactly shocked. I have no idea what the extent of his involvement with drugs was but what was clear to anyone was that his hectic social life was impacting on his ability to play football and I wasn’t sorry to see him leave the club. 

We didn’t miss him. Mourinho had impressed on us from the beginning his decision to change the basic formation from 4-4-2 to 4-3-2-1. He wanted to break the lines up and make the team more fluid. It was actually more of a diamond to start with but the system evolved to the point where I moved from the front of the diamond to the left side of the midfield three. The pressure built steadily leading up to the first league match of the season against Manchester United – even more than in the first season of Mr Abramovich’s ownership. Now we had a ‘special’ manager and more new players and the expectation had increased in line with the spending. Seven new signings – Drogba, Carvalho, Ferreira, Kezman, Robben, Tiago, and Cech had arrived for a cool £82 million.",0,1379015651,null,0,false,0,cc72jnm,t3_1m9mce,t1_cc72jnm,t3_1m9mce,null,1429486283,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12

Not bad for one summer.

Just for good measure the media had dubbed the contest a managers’ rematch because of the Champions League tie the previous season in which Mourinho’s Porto had eliminated United at Old Trafford, causing something of a disagreement between our new boss and Sir Alex Ferguson. 

Mourinho called a team meeting the day before the match. We had already discussed our tactics and were very well drilled on what to expect and what was expected from us. But the boss had a more important message to convey. ‘You will read in the press and hear in the media me saying that I don’t expect us to win the league in my first season,’ he said. ‘I want you to be very clear that I have said this only to keep the pressure off all of us. I also want you to know that I do expect us to win the Premiership this season. I know that we will. We are winners and winning is all that matters. I don’t want to be second or third. We want to win this league and we will.’ 

I felt myself draw a sharp breath – no more of the Ranieri method of focus on performance and improve on last season. Winning was everything – new manager, new Chelsea. It was just what we needed. United came to the Bridge to take the wind from our sails but they didn’t succeed. 

It wasn’t pretty but we won the match thanks to a goal from Eidur. I didn’t play particularly well and the diamond didn’t function properly. We stayed strong though and defended sternly as a team and that was the direction Mourinho wanted us to take. We’d done a lot of work on defending as a unit and it paid off in that first game. He was cute enough to realize that he couldn’t turn us into a fluid attacking unit in seven weeks so instead he made us hard to beat. In fact we had defeated one of our title rivals at the first time of asking. It was calculating and it was brilliant and that was the way we started the campaign until the fourth game when Coley came in and added a bit more flair. 

Robben and Duff were both injured from pre-season and we would have to wait until November before we saw the new formation in full glorious flow. Until then we got a lot of stick in the press for being boring and defensive but the manager never remarked on it to us – he didn’t care. I was concerned about my own form though. Mourinho had invested a lot of faith in me and I didn’t feel I was justifying it over the first two games. 

A couple of days after the victory at Crystal Palace in the third match he took me aside and told me that he liked the way I had run the midfield – the Prozone statistics had shown that I was involved in all four of the top passing partnerships in the match. That is what he wanted from me – industry and involvement. I scored my first goal in the next match against Southampton and we were undefeated until we went to Manchester City on 16 October. 

People were already asking if we could emulate Arsenal and go the whole season unbeaten. The answer was no. Nicolas Anelka scored from a penalty and we lost the match by a single goal. That was it. The bubble had burst and now it would revert to same old Chelsea and collapse. Not a chance. 

Losing was a new experience under Mourinho and I wondered what reaction it would provoke in him. The answer was simple: none. He told us straight after the game that we had done enough to win it twice, that we should not be downbeat. It was unrealistic to expect not to suffer one defeat. ‘Just make sure it doesn’t happen again.’ He smiled as he said it and we understood. 

Far from being the beginning of our demise defeat became the catalyst for our most impressive spell of the campaign. The diamond had evolved to the more familiar 4-3-3 and Robben started to wreak havoc among opposition defences, having returned to the team after injury. Drogba was a powerful presence at the point of attack and I was running through from midfield to support and scoring more. We embarked on a goal spree which saw us score forty-seven times in our next twenty-one outings – not bad for a boring defensive team! Our momentum saw our points total soar and the manager sensed that he was now managing his team – he had won our hearts and minds. 

A new confidence enveloped the squad and when Mourinho gave an instruction it was carried out as second nature. People began to notice that occasionally he would send a sub on with handwritten notes which would be given to me or John. There was no big secret – the note might contain instructions about who should be marked at corners or how better we could use our formation. Sometimes it would be much more blunt, carrying only the message: ‘WIN.’ 

We knew what he wanted because we wanted the same. We were five points ahead of Arsenal when we travelled to Highbury on 12 December. They had been leading the Premiership at one stage but had their unbeaten run ended by Manchester United and then lost their way a bit. Mourinho cleverly transferred the pressure to them when he stated before the match that we needed only a draw. As always, we went there looking for victory. 

Lads like JT, Eidur, and I who had been at Chelsea a while were sick of losing to Arsenal in the league. None of us had ever beaten them and Chelsea had failed to in fourteen years of trying. I was tired of feeling that we had been the best team in those derby matches but never had much to show for it. This contest would throw up little more joy for Chelsea in that respect as we were twice down at Highbury but came back to draw the match. Thierry Henry scored both though the second was a hotly disputed free-kick which he had taken quickly to beat Petr Cech who was still arranging our defence. JT and Eidur struck back for a ‘moral victory’ but more important was that for the first time we began to get the Premiership trophy in our sights. So too did the manager who from then on regularly pointed out how far ahead we would be if we won this game or that game. He used the building of a lead to motivate us to put more space between ourselves and our rivals. 

We kept winning. In the past when we had to get a victory to stay ahead we would fail, but not now. Over the Christmas period, when we traditionally slipped up, we put together an impressive sequence of results: Portsmouth away, 2-0; Liverpool away, 1-0; Middlesbrough at home, 2-0. We were reaching perfection. 

The Premiership was not the only competition where we were on a roll. January saw us take on Manchester United in the semi-final of the Carling Cup which people had mistakenly believed we would have been happy to sacrifice for other honours – not so with Mourinho in charge. The first leg at our place was high tempo and hard work. It ended goalless but the aftermath was not without incident as our manager told the press he had seen Sir Alex Ferguson berating referee Neale Barry in the tunnel at half-time. Mourinho then pointed out that the second half had been riddled with free-kicks (most of them in United’s favour). ‘It was whistle and whistle, fault and fault, cheat and cheat,’ and not for the first time his words were scrutinized and inevitably used as a rod to beat him. He was charged with improper conduct by the FA and then fined £5,000. 

The controversy merely fuelled our motivation in the return leg at Old Trafford but I had been aware for a while of the changing mood in the media towards Mourinho. I put it down to the fact that we kept winning games and some people were desperate to see us lose a few just to see how the manager would cope. But he kept his cool and ensured that none of the external pressure on him ever found its way into the dressing room. 

We were still in the hunt for every competition we had entered and there had been a lot of headlines referring to a possible ‘grand slam’. It wasn’t something any of us had even considered. We hadn’t secured our first trophy yet, never mind four of them, and that was the kind of distraction we could do without. 

I never gave it a thought even after I collected Didier’s layoff at Old Trafford and swept a left-foot shot into the net to put us ahead in the Carling Cup return leg. After all of the furore surrounding the first game, it was a sweet moment for us. United, though, are still the benchmark for everyone in English football and there was no chance of them giving up. Ryan Giggs replied with a great finish to level it but we weren’t finished yet. Duffa caused panic in their defence with five minutes left when he whipped in a free-kick and we may have been a little fortunate that it found the net. I couldn’t have cared less – you can be the best team in the world but you won’t win without a bit of luck. We were in the final – the first of the season, our first under Mourinho, and the first for Mr Abramovich. All we had to do now was beat Liverpool. 

My previous experience of Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium was very mixed. The FA Cup Final in 2002 in which we lost to Arsenal was a huge disappointment, though I took some satisfaction from the way I had battled with Vieira and the fact that we had made that stage in my first season with Chelsea. We checked in to the St David’s Bay Hotel and John pointed out that it was the same one we had used for the match with Arsenal. He did this, of course, because he is superstitious. 

A lot of players are afflicted by this strange condition and I am not totally immune though my good luck habits don’t extend much beyond wearing the same watch for the next match after a victory. JT is different. In fact, he’s unique when it comes to the lengths he will go to in order to re-create the exact conditions required to keep lady luck on his side – from keeping the same seats on the bus to using the same urinal in the dressing room at Stamford Bridge; from pre-match meals to counting lamp posts to parking spaces.",0,1379016175,null,0,false,0,cc72r4w,t3_1m9mce,t1_cc72r4w,t3_1m9mce,null,1429486187,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

I dreaded the effect staying in the hotel might have on John, given that he had woken up with vertigo the morning of the 2002 FA Cup Final and only made the bench. I checked his balance first thing the next morning – perfect; a good omen already. It didn’t last into the match though – within the first minute we were a goal down. We threw everything at Liverpool but nothing worked except a cruel twist of fate. Stevie Gerrard flicked the ball into his own net from a free-kick and the match went to extra-time. 

Eidur played alongside Claude Makelele and me in midfield and was excellent. People call him versatile but in fact he is just a very good footballer. He was the player who impressed me most when I first joined Chelsea. I was in awe of how natural he was with a ball at his feet and how sharply he turned thought into action on the pitch. He was outstanding in that final and when Didi poked a shot under Dudek to put us ahead I thought it was all over. However, there was more drama left, as they equalized and then Eidur’s shot was spilled to Kezman who swept it home. 

The memory of lifting the Carling Cup is sweet and my winner’s medal is precious. We celebrated like you would expect for a team which had won their first trophy under a new manager though my favourite moment of the party was Roman lifting the Carling Cup at dinner to drink champagne from it. We all cheered and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a broader smile on a man. I was content. I had left West Ham for Chelsea to win things and now after four years I had achieved my first and definitely not the last. 

The Champions League was a competition which we felt very strongly about. For most of us, there was a nagging sense of unfinished business after the way we had lost to Monaco the year before. Barcelona was not the ideal draw for the first knockout stage and not just because they were the most exciting team in Europe. Ronaldinho’s skills would be hard to contain though not as difficult to cope with as the demand for tickets in my house. All of Elen’s relations are Barca fans and we were expecting a full house as well as a mini-family section at the Bridge for the second leg. The first match, however, produced a controversy the likes of which I have never been involved in. 

It was as fierce a contest on the pitch as the build-up to it had suggested: bragging rights and the odd insult had been tossed back and forth and each side jostled for advantage. Once again we benefited from an own goal which saw us take a lead into half-time. Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard seemed incensed by some of the refereeing and by the time I reached our dressing room there was clearly something very wrong. 

Some of our coaching staff were shouting while others were pointing to the Barca dressing room accusingly. Mourinho ushered all of us inside and gave his summary of what we needed to do to stay ahead. It was calm enough when we left for the pitch but all hell broke loose when Didi was sent off within ten minutes of the re-start. He had already been wound up by the antics of Marquez and Puyol – big strong guys – who had been falling too easily in the first half and then protesting that he should be booked. Now it was the turn of their keeper to play up after Didi’s innocuous challenge in a 50/50 situation. Barca players surrounded referee Anders Frisk and sure enough Didi was red carded. They scored twice to win 2-1. After the match I was told that some of our staff had seen Rijkaard approach Frisk in an area which was reserved for match officials only. Mourinho refused to speak at the post-match press conference and what ensued felt like a war waged on Chelsea by UEFA and the media.

The club protested that Rijkaard had attempted to influence the referee at half-time and pointed out that Didi had been sent off shortly after play resumed. UEFA were quick to deny the allegation though Frisk later admitted that he had to ask Rijkaard to leave a restricted area during the break, saying it was neither the place nor the moment to discuss the match. The situation spiralled out of control when Frisk then announced his retirement from refereeing, claiming he had received threats to himself and his family. UEFA’s media chief William Gaillard popped up in the English media more times than Tony Blair as he slagged off Mourinho and Chelsea while another UEFA official, Volker Roth, labelled our manager ‘an enemy of football’. It was a full-scale crusade against us. I was dumbfounded. I couldn’t believe that people in positions of responsibility would wilfully inflame the situation in such an unnecessary way. 

Just as damaging was the way the English media fanned the campaign. I could never imagine the press in Spain or Italy siding with UEFA against one of their major clubs. It would have been nice if people had defended us but no one was even prepared to entertain the idea that we had a genuine grievance. 

To say we were fired up for the second game is an understatement. That simmering sense of injustice is one reason why we exploded out of the blocks and were three up after twenty-six minutes. After everything that had gone before, it felt like we were in dreamland. A minute later Ronaldinho brought us firmly back to earth with a penalty before reality kicked us even harder when he scored a magnificent second. What had been billed as the most competitive meeting of the season was beginning to look like a free-for-all. For all our audacity though, scoring three against Barca meant nothing because we were out on away goals at that point. It took JT to stretch his full height and strength to head a dramatic winner in the final minutes to get us into the quarter-final and strike a blow for natural justice. We were delirious – well I was along with everyone at Chelsea though there were a few long Catalan faces around our house that night. Elen’s wasn’t one of them – she is Chelsea now and supports me ahead of her hometown club. 

We had progressed but at a price. Mourinho was banned from the technical area for the tie against Bayern Munich because of his comments about Rijkaard and Frisk but if UEFA’s intention was to smack us back into line then they had another thing coming. We were more determined than ever to fly in the face of the establishment and Bayern were as much a part of the ruling classes as any club in Europe. 

The match at the Bridge is one of the best I played that season. We were all fired up for it. The manager gave his pre-match talk the night before the game but he didn’t use the situation to try to motivate us. He didn’t need to. Speculation about where Mourinho would watch the action from threatened to turn our biggest game of the season into a circus of photographers balancing on the back of motorcycles. It degenerated further when a conspiracy theory was hatched shortly after kick-off that Rui Faria was concealing some kind of communication device under a woolly hat. Why not just go the whole hog and claim that Mourinho himself was hiding under there? 

The truth is that the boss didn’t need to be on the bench or even in the stand. When we are on the pitch he is always with us – in every move we make and every kick we take. We knew he was watching somewhere and hopefully he liked what he saw. We were a bit stuck at 1-1 and slightly concerned at having conceded an away goal. However, a chance fell slightly behind me but I managed to dig it out from twenty yards and beat Oliver Kahn to regain the lead. Nice one – but I wasn’t finished yet. 

Maka flighted a pass towards me and as I tracked the flight of the ball I realized it was a fraction too high to take on my chest. The angle wasn’t great and I could sense a defender was closing me down. I had a choice: either I attempt an overhead kick or I allow it to drop over my shoulder and on to my left foot – probably two of the most difficult moves to execute in football though an easy way of making a complete tit of yourself. I opted for the second and caught the ball beautifully on the volley to smash it into the net – not bad for my ‘weaker’ foot. It’s one of my favourite goals for Chelsea and though I don’t normally keep boots I have reserved a special place at home for the pair I wore that night. The game finished 4-2 and we went on to battle to an aggregate victory in Munich to make the semi-final for the second year in a row. 

http://www.metacafe.com/watch/175234/frank_lampard_scores_an_awesome_goal/

It was quite an achievement. Even the media had begun to pay us some grudging respect though I have to say that the relationship between us and the press is not all bad. We stayed in Munich the night of the match and a couple of lads from the papers joined the players for a beer afterwards. They were buying. Cheers Dan. 

Having been knocked out of the FA Cup at Newcastle in February meant we had a week to prepare to play Arsenal at home in the Premiership. Victory would put us fourteen points ahead with five games to play and while the title wouldn’t be ours mathematically it would be a fitting way to celebrate its inevitability. It wasn’t to be. A goalless draw left us needing six points and all of a sudden the manager could add astrology to his impressive list of talents. Earlier in the campaign he predicted that Chelsea would win the championship on 30 April when we would play away at Bolton. After we beat Fulham only Spurs could scupper his emerging rivalry with Russell Grant. Victory over Arsenal would hand us the title without kicking a ball and we all gathered in La Famiglia restaurant to watch their match.",0,1379017094,null,0,1379019539,0,cc733ys,t3_1m9mce,t1_cc733ys,t3_1m9mce,null,1429486019,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

The manager had decided we should spend the two nights before the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool in the Chelsea Village Hotel so it was a short hop on the Monday night. Roman brought some huge pots of the finest Russian caviar for us to eat. I love the stuff and was tucking in while most of the lads looked at me strangely. I reckon they were worth about five grand a pot and I was glad for the good food given how bland the game was. Arsenal were ahead for a while and then Robbie Keane had a header in the last few minutes. We all jumped up instinctively but I was quite relieved when it flashed past the post. I didn’t want to win the league in a restaurant on the Kings Road. I had waited all of my life for that moment and no amount of Russia’s finest caviar would have made up for missing out on being on the pitch and actually celebrating the victory as a football team.

I lay in bed thinking about what was ahead. In the next eight days we could clinch the Premiership and qualify for the Champions League final – again, not bad for a ‘boring team’ from west London! The first leg of the semi against Liverpool didn’t quite match the ties against Barca and Bayern in terms of goals though the ‘Battle of Britain’ was thrilling as a contest. The return leg was no less enervating. The crowd at Anfield is so vocal and intense that it feels like they are directly above the pitch screaming on top of you rather than filling its sides. Maybe we got caught in the moment because we allowed our guard to slip early and conceded the now infamous goal that never was. I have heard and read people say that Chelsea should stop whining about Garcia’s effort. That it doesn’t matter if the ball crossed the line or not because the referee gave a goal. Oh really? My reply is simple: If you had worked as hard as we had to reach that stage of the Champions League then you would feel a right to protest as well. 

In fact, if we had scored that ‘goal’ and not Liverpool I wonder how their players would have reacted. No differently I suspect. We did everything to try and redeem the situation – piled on pressure, players up front and tried everything we knew to break them down. 

When the ball fell to Eidur in the final minute within yards of the goal I thought we had them. One hit Eidur. One hit. His volley was true and it flashed across Dudek’s goal and Jamie Carragher got a touch on it at the far post to make sure it didn’t go in. The whistle sounded and I felt a surge of anger well up in me. To get to one semi-final and lose to Monaco the year before was unlucky. To be involved in another the following season seemed unjust. I tried to make sense of it. After all, they were struggling to qualify for the Champions League, while we were busy trying to wrap up Chelsea’s first league championship in 50 years. We had beaten Liverpool twice in the Premiership so why couldn’t we in Europe? No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t work it out. All I was certain of was how low I felt at the result. I hate losing. I really hate it. Conceding the title was not possible and in between the European matches we had a pressing date in Bolton and her name was destiny. 

As we travelled north I remembered some of the things that had been said to me in the previous weeks about winning the league. It seemed that everywhere I went I ran into Chelsea fans, all of whom were eager to let me know what the title meant to them. It had been fifty years since Chelsea won the league – fifty long years – and even though I had only been with the club for a fraction of that time I felt the same pent-up frustration as the fans about waiting any longer. I knew what it meant to them because of what it meant to me. 

We stayed at the Preston Marriott and the night before the game I threw the question out as I was sitting with John and Eidur chilling out: ‘Imagine what it would be like to score the goal that wins the league?’ We were silent as the thought drifted out there. I wasn’t trying to pre-empt anything but it was something I had thought about, dreamt about, for much of my life and this was the first time I had been in a position where it was a possibility. 

The journey from our hotel to the Reebok was full of nervous excitement. As always, I sat with JT, Eidur and Bill Blood and I blurted out the same question I had the night before. What would it be like? Come on! Come on! The adrenalin began to flow and when we arrived at the stadium we were all pumped and ready to go. You imagine you will be infallible in situations like that, that when the hand of fate beckons you towards glory, nothing can trip you up – that is until you go for the warm-up and find a pitch that looks like a cow field. Bolton are hard enough to play at home – a bad pitch in the freezing cold just complicates it. They carved out their normal game and Kevin Nolan was flicking things on and they made a couple of half chances. We barely responded in the first half – we seemed to be seizing up in the bitter wind and allowing our grip on history to slip. The half-time team talk was designed to breathe some fire back into us. We were expecting a bollocking but the manager’s anger was turned into a question. 

‘We are not playing well but we are not doing too badly,’ he said. ‘Why? I don’t understand. Keep it simple. Play the way you can and you will succeed. Before we had ninety minutes to win the league and now we have forty-five. Now go and do it!’ He was right. We hadn’t worked this hard or come this far to let ourselves down. I felt renewed energy in my legs and a surge of confidence similar to when the manager had told me I was the best player in the world. I heard his voice in my head: ‘You need to prove that and win trophies.’ Now was my chance. Now was our chance to prove we were the best.

Didi cushioned the ball across to me but Vincent Candela blocked my sight of goal. I looked up for options but no one was in space. To hell with it, I’ll have a go. I dropped my shoulder and got the half yard I needed for the angle to drive my shot past Jussi Jaaskelainen. Goal. Goal. Goal. Goal. Gooooaaaaaalllllll!!!!!!!!! 

I spun away and ran shouting with every pace. I made a bolt for our fans at the other side of the box. Mum and Dad couldn’t get tickets for the directors’ area and somewhere in the blue bedlam they were celebrating the same as me. The lads smothered me with hugs and I had to fight them off to see some daylight. This was it. This was what it felt like to be a winner. My heart was still pounding when minutes later I found myself in acres and acres of space. It was surreal – like a dream. I was just running – running like I would never get to the goal or the mass of blue and white who were standing on their toes behind it. I could see Ricky pushing on beside me, shouting for a pass. I pretended not to hear. I was determined to finish it off. Dad was sitting behind the goal and when I got to the edge of the box he was shouting ‘Shoot, shoot!’ I couldn’t hear him because another voice in my head was telling me I should go round Jaaskelainen and roll it in – not my normal type of finish but stylish and if you’re going to win the league then what better way to do it? It took a few seconds for the rest of the lads to catch me up but they got there soon enough. It’s hard to describe exactly what I felt just then – difficult because extreme emotions don’t fit into words very comfortably. 

Elation is too temporary – this was more substantial and I can still feel it now when I close my eyes and re-live that moment. Everything that came afterwards was fantastic. It was everything I imagined it to be and more. We soaked Roman with champagne then went back to the pitch and took him with us. There wasn’t a lot of sensible conversation between us. He had lived every minute of that season and he deserved to take his share of the credit. He hadn’t just pumped money in and sat back waiting for things to happen – he helped make it happen and he loved being out there with us. I looked around for the manager and saw him sitting quietly in the dugout. He phoned his family, spoke to his wife and children, and was happy to have shared part of the moment with them while the rest of us carried on like loonies on the pitch. Outside the stadium John and I got our heads out of the top of the bus to sing with the hundreds of fans who had waited to see us. We were among them and that was a special moment. I knew how important it was and it meant at least as much to them and maybe more. The celebration back at the hotel was very muted by comparison. 

We would play the second leg of the semi-final in the Champions League at Anfield on the Wednesday so we had a couple of beers with our dinner while it began to sink in that we were the Premiership champions. I was still buzzing with the adrenalin of the game and the goals but sat down with Eidur and we had a beer and watched the game on Match of the Day. I could hardly believe what I was watching. I could see myself on the screen – me, Eidur, John, Coley, big Pete, Ricky, Geremi, Tiago, Maka, Didi. I scored one, then another. 

It was like watching a dream – your own dream, there for everyone to see, and it was perfect, absolutely perfect. Losing to Liverpool three days later meant we failed by a whisker to make the European Cup Final for a second consecutive season. I hate losing. I really hate it. We had won two trophies though and in claiming the league we had proved ourselves to be the best team in England.

A couple of weeks later I picked up an individual prize when I was voted the Football Writers’ Association Player of the Year. It was a great honour and the evening was made all the more special because I was able to share it with my family and friends – the people who mean most to me, those who have changed my life and helped me to get to the point in my career that I had yearned for more than anything else. Jose Mourinho is part of that special group though unlike him I would never tout myself as the best player in the world. Among the best in England, yes. I think I have proven that.

The recession has almost nothing to do with benefits, and everything to do with financial mismanagement on behalf of the executive classes. 

It's a complete myth that its every irresponible JSA claiming chav on the corner's or single benefit claiming mother's fault that we've had to tighten our belts in recent years. But it's a very common scapegoat in our society because people use things like this to vent their frustration, to froth at the mouth talking about their tax money and the scroungers bleeding the UK dry, these people are usually the very same who bought some ridiculously overpriced 3 bedroom detached in some oversold middle class utopia on a variable rate mortgage without a penny down in 2005, on the basis that you can't lose with property and defaulted in 2007/8.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; I read your post, and again I read this one, and again you have not answered my simple question - face it, you don't have an answer. You don't have any reason to have to call out someone for being selfish for killing themselves, because you realise it serves no purpose.

Alright, I'll make it short and simple for you: I call out someone for being selfish for killing themselves *by throwing themselves in-front of a vehicle* because I find the culture of falling over ourselves to feel sorry for suicide cases whilst ignoring the knock on effect to be quite tiring. The blog post OP linked to is full of it with no further thought for anyone else affected by the actions of one person committing suicide. 

You might not respect it, but I hope it's clear enough. 

&gt;  A person who may the least selfish person of all time could still kill themselves in this way. Would they deserve to have the label of ""selfish"" attached to them for succumbing to a symptom of the illness they have?

To someone who only knows them for their selfish last act? Yes. 

&gt; Forget who it affects..

That's your problem, right there. 

&gt;  ...do you think it is fair to assign that personality trait to someone who killed themself?

*If they did it by throwing themselves infront of a vehicle, traumatising the operator of the vehicle, the clean up crew, anyone else who witnessed it... delaying (insert estimate here) who may have been on their way to work, a nice day out or rushing to hospital to be with a dying relative...* Yes. Yes I do. 

Your thoughts end with the deceased and their family. Again my argument - my reason for posting all this - is that their acts domino across others who have not been acknowledged.

&gt; It is so frustrating when someone purposely misses your point to try and make theirs. 

I agree.. but you know what? I made mine first today. You came along afterwards and replied to me - demanding your point be made. 

&gt; Again more proof you just aren't interested in my point.

I'm not obliged to be. 

&gt; You claim to care about the victims, but what purpose or benefit to the other people involved does it have to label the person so sick they killed themselves selfish? 

It acknowledges that others *were* affected - which is more than the blog article or you can manage. 

&gt; Why not show some compassion for the family, and for the ill person whose sickness causes them to make decisions they certainly wouldn't make normally? 

I acknowledged that suicide is tragic. If that wasn't a flowery enough statement for you, I apologise, but that's not why I'm here. 

&gt; I would also like to say I am frankly insulted by your complete straw man attack that I don't care about the other victims.

Again, I'm not obliged to care or be interested. You replied to me first. You felt the need to claim I have no point to make (I believe I've shown several times now that I have). My initial post recognises the tragedy of suicide and you've felt the need to imply that I don't recognise it - so do continue to talk of straw man attacks. 

I demand no apologies and expect none in return. This is Reddit - not the houses of parliament or some political hearing in which I'm running for an office position. You don't know me, I don't know you. Tomorrow is a new day and we can both forget this conversation entirely. For now however, I must again point out that this site is a place of comments and opinions and if you expect yours to be the only ones - or the only ones that matter - or the only ones that get recognised - you have much to learn about this site. 

In addition to my lack of need for apologies, I also don't see any benefit to continuing this. I've said my piece and some have agreed with it - some have not.

Unfortunately the response time data isn't included in the download... so the stat that I suspect is the most important isn't easily available.

But... eye'ng the chart of first pumper response times... there appears to be very little variation, cresting slightly in 2008 and then slightly curving down to 2011.

So... it seems that Boris hasn't set London on fire, and doesn't appear to be on a path to do so.

The challenge with statistics like these is that they require considerable explanation... and far too many folks have no interest in finding things out on their own.

Of course I'd not claim that all right wing people think everyone's defrauding the state, but there is a belief that far outstrips the DWP's own numbers, and IDS himself has been caught out again and again either misrepresenting figures or just outright lying to cast a darker image over claimants.

I do feel that they're trying to move public opinion away from those in need so they can make further cuts.

I should say I work with people looking for work, and my place is a food bank at the weekends, so I'm seeing the effects, and I'm not seeing people on benefits wasting handfuls of money then coming to claim a few days' basic rations.  Quite often people are in a terrible emotional state, and ashamed to have to ask.  I'm certainly not seeing the 'entitlement' that I've seen in some of these threads.

Again, I understand there's a minority who abuse any system, but we don't slash all car tyres because some people drive badly.

The recipe I got from GeneralFROSTY calls for 2 parts dark teal, one part black, and latex glaze. Everything is in latex and you use a lot more of the glaze than you do the color. it's also thinned with a little water. Experiment until you have the mix right, then mix up a big batch. Wipe on with sea sponge in thin layers. You're going for a random effect, which happens when things get dirty then washed off.

true,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"The most often reported result is that using a phone makes you 4 times as likely to have an accident. For the sake of argument, lets assume this is true.

At any given moment, what percentage of drivers are on the phone? Guestimate, 5% maybe? Actually I think it is less than that, but I'll err on the side of caution.

So if the number of calls increases by 7% after 9am, that 5% becomes 5.35%. In other words, an extra 0.35% of drivers now have 4 times as much risk of an accident. This corresponds to an expected increase in accident rates of about 1%

We are not expecting a massive spike in accidents after 9am, even if the existing prediction is correct, even if you are 4 times as likely to have an accident while on a phone. Just 1%.

So if driving after 9am is inherently a tiny bit safer, because people are less tired and generally in less of a hurry, then that could entirely mask the danger of using a phone.

Incidentally, although 1% extra accidents is difficult to detect when you aren't exactly comparing like with like, it is still a hell of a lot of accidents. A lot of insurance claims, minor injuries and quite a few more serious accidents.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In my case I had a Nexus One, and it suffered from the design flaw where the power button stops responding (because the flex cable that connects it to the motherboard eventually wears through and breaks).

The first time I needed it to be repaired I had to get the retailer involved because HTC wouldn't touch it - they thought it was a phone supplied by Vodafone Germany (they actually wanted me to call Vodafone DE to arrange a repair, despite not being a customer and in the UK), not the SIM free model I thought I was sold. It took weeks for it to be fixed. I had to pay for postage to France.

It broke a few months later, same problem, and I had to through the process again. This time the retailer / HTC service centre first tried to deny a repair because they said it was out of warranty - even though the stuff in the box said 2 years, and in any case UK and EU law are on my side. Then they changed their mind and claimed it had water damage - amazing considering it was always in a waterproof case.

So I just gave up with them (they wanted £50 to ship my broken phone back). I did buy an iPhone, mostly because I'd tried Android and wanted to try the other side. It's also nice to know that they are much easier to get something out of compared to HTC.

I know I'll never buy another HTC phone.

Pricing isn't a very good argument. It's very possible that Google is heavily subsidising / willing to take a hit on the Nexus line in order to prove a point, get product out, etc. There's a reason why the likes of the Galaxy S4 (as a flagship phone) are nowhere near the same price - the pricing is closer to the iPhone.

Apart from that, people of all ages are affected at the moment. We get plenty of people phoning up to sign off due to starting work, however, though a lot of these jobs are temporary and they're back claiming within a couple of months.

I'm okay ta. Muddling along. Bit pissed off with friends today, a) cancelling drinks for the second night in a row and b) not turning up for a job interview at my place.

However, I bought a nice new jacket and my new nail varnish looks good. Also, I've discovered the miracle that is taking makeup off with olive oil and my face is as soft as a baby's backside. Not that I make a habit of touching baby's backsides, you understand. On the downside, my face smells of food and I want to eat it. I also think I've found the perfect eyebrow shape for my face, after years of being ignorant about them. I might've also found the perfect red lipstick. Shame that my tummy is so bloated that I'm going to have to wear a black sack to work tomorrow as I dunno if I'll fit into any of my dresses. 

Other than that, it's all a bit meh really. I should be in Paris with a friend this weekend but can't afford it, so instead I'm going to stay in and watch films and pester the patrons of TRL. Oh balls, just looked at my calendar. My favourite club night is on Saturday. Poordom + massive bloated tummy = no dancing for GWNU. Unless someone wants to shout me some cash and immediate liposuction?

&gt;His response? 4 weeks of pills instead

They do that. I saw the doctor about anxiety a while ago and the first thing he did was offer me pills. When I politely declined he gave me a self assessment form to complete, which will eventually lead to CBT or some other form of talking. Also, bear in mind that pills take longer than a fortnight to have an effect, and what works for one person won't necessarily work for another. So you do have to give it a little while longer, but it's also important that someone close to you is aware you are taking them and is keeping a close eye on your general state of mind. You may not realise if you're getting worse, someone close to you will. 

This wine is really nice. Bartender, may I have some more please?

This led to people calling back hours later, justifiably angry that they'd been fobbed off while they or their partner/mother/baby suffered.

Understandably, after about a week of this I just had to quit - yet apparently to some, this means I just don't want to work.

Considering we're on the subject of unelected leaders, its rather funny that you should mention Gordon Brown?  He became Prime Minister by conspiring to remove the elected prime minister from power.  Following that he became PM by running for party leadership unopposed without facing a party vote to become party leader nor a vote by general election to become PM.  Cameron has more right to hold the position of Prime Minister than Brown ever did.

true,rzam,lfc68,,"Allow me to begin, using OP's depth chart above as a starting point.

As a diehard LFC supporter and tactical wonk, I've spent too many hours killing time at work by filling pages of my notebook with depth charts just like that one. I've done them in different formations and formats, using the players in the squad in different tactical formations that Rodgers has exhibited in his time at the club.

One of my favorite formats (and one of the easiest ways to deduce how deep a squad truly is) lines the team up **using one position per player.** That means that, rather than using Coutinho as, say, both a starting attacking midfielder *and* a backup left winger, you can only jot him down in one of those positions. Same for the likes of Suarez -- if you have him down as starting at second striker, you can't also have him as Sturridge's backup at the No. 9 position. Think of it as if we had to field two, separate first XIs from our available squad.

Now, obviously, this isn't how a real squad functions. But it's an informative way of looking at how deep the squad really is because, as Rodgers himself has said, an ideal squad would go two quality options deep in every position and then supplement those 22 players with further options -- preferably younger players who don't have to be in the reckoning for the first team, but who are there to get games when they're available or fill in during an injury crisis.

So, if you draw up a Liverpool side realistically, using all the players in the squad in multiple positions within the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1/4-2-1-2-1 that Rodgers prefers, you'd be hard pressed to get anything different than what we see above in OP's chart. I'd have Wisdom ahead of Kelly at RB, have Wisdom and Ilori as 3rd choice center backs, and also put Aspas as an option behind the striker (as he's played in the opening three PL games), but it's virtually the same.

But let's say you use the method I described, using each player in one position, and one position only, on the depth chart. I've come up with this:

**GK**
 Mignolet
- Jones

**RB**
 Johnson
- Wisdom
- Kelly

**CB**
 Toure
- Skrtel
- Ilori

**CB**
 Agger
- Sakho

**LB**
 Enrique
- Cissokho

**CM**
 Lucas
- ?

**CM**
 Gerrard
- Allen

**CAM**
 Coutinho
- Alberto

**RW**
 Henderson
- Sterling
- Ibe

**LW**
 Suarez
- Moses

**ST**
 Sturridge
- Aspas

This excludes Coates, who of course is out for virtually the entire year with a ligament tear. Players out on loan (Borini, Assaidi, Reina, etc.) are naturally excluded. Also left out are Flanagan, McLaughlin, Yesil, Sinclair, Morgan, and any other youth or reserve players who have yet to figure in the manager's squad plans. We're left with a 24-man squad of players who Rodgers has shown willingness to rely on against quality opposition, and who will actually factor in the squad this year.

So what does this perspective tell us? Well, the pickups of Sakho, Ilori and Moses on Deadline Day were critical to squad depth. If we had failed to land even one of Sakho or Ilori, we'd have been left with just an injury-prone Agger, a 32-year old Toure, an out-of-favor Skrtel and the inexperienced Wisdom/Kelly duo as our CB options. That is, quite simply, not ""top four"" depth. Now that Liverpool's added two young CBs, Skrtel's had a bit of a mini-renaissance with the United match and Kolo Toure has become a Merseyside folk hero almost overnight, the club has taken a position that constituted one of its biggest weaknesses and made it one of its greatest strengths. We have 10 players of quality at our disposal at the back now; unless we experience a major injury crisis of epic proportions, defensive depth won't be an issue this season. In fact, we actually have *too many defensive players* -- unless he's done enough to prove that Rodgers should give him a run in the first team, I'd be surprised if Skrtel isn't sold in January (or next summer at the latest). Likewise, Martin Kelly is coming off a major injury and needs games; either him or Wisdom should leave on loan in January, with the one remaining serving as cover for Glen Johnson (Wisdom will almost certainly fill in during Johnson's upcoming injury absence).

Moses, meanwhile, is just as important to the squad. All summer, we tried to sign the player who Rodgers said would ""bring that extra bit of quality in the final third."" You know the story; we failed in bids for Mkhitaryan, Costa and Willian (the first would have pushed Coutinho out wide almost exclusively, the second would played on the wing or backed up Sturridge up top, and the third would have started out wide for us). Moses is only in on loan, and he's not world-class by any stretch. He is, however, a quality player who will start a lot of games for us this year in a position that will feature either Suarez or Coutinho (depending on which plays centrally and which is shifted to the left), a converted central midfielder (albeit one who's playing out of his mind on the flank in Jordan Henderson) and two teenagers. He's a fast, physical athlete, technically sound and experienced in the English game. He'll give us a different look out on the wing; hopefully, he seizes this opportunity and proves the player who had all the top clubs tracking him at Crystal Palace.

Still, there are issues with the squad that the club failed to address this summer. Maybe they didn't have time, with all the resources tied up in failed bids for the aforementioned players and the efforts to bring in Sakho, Ilori and Moses. Maybe Rodgers and the club just didn't feel they needed addressing, happy with the squad they have for a season without European football. Whatever the case, there are needs -- particularly when you look at the **types** of players that we're missing. I've detailed these needs (there are three pressing ones) in my reply below, in order of priority:",0,1379026094,null,0,1379039084,0,cc76gvs,t3_1m9bwi,t1_cc76gvs,t1_cc71zhr,null,1429484452,24,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,24
true,rzam,lfc68,,"**1. Defensive Midfielder:** See that question mark? Yep, it ties into the point of this entire thread: we don't have a player who can fill in as a midfield anchor in the event that Lucas is forced to miss a match. There's the question of Ilori, but I've stated my case for not playing him there in my first comment above. There's also Joe Allen, who's capable in the role, but not nearly ideal. While Allen was one of the best ball winners in the Premier League last year (per [WhoScored.com](http://www.whoscored.com/Blog/nfjguoozpumzj-wg7xluca/Show/Player-Focus-Premier-Possession-Winners)), his traits better suit the deep-lying playmaker role that Gerrard currently occupies. I really rate Joe Allen, but injuries aside, I think the main issue with his tenure at the club has been the insistence on playing him out of position -- he's either filling in for Lucas as the deepest midfield player, or Rodgers has him playing as basically a no. 10 ahead of Gerrard and Lucas. Besides, the point of this exercise is squad depth, and with Henderson looking like a fixture on the right side, Liverpool have very little in terms of central midfield cover. In terms of defensive midfield options especially, we have no natural depth at the position -- which not only leaves us exposed if Lucas can't go for whatever reason, but also limits the sort of looks we're able put out on the field. You can't say Liverpool couldn't have used a defensive, midfield stopper on the bench to throw on when up 1-0 at Villa and looking to grind out a win. This is why I think we should bring back Momo Sissoko. But that's another argument altogether.

**2. Striker:** Let's pretend that Sturridge isn't carrying a injury that may or may not keep him out of the Swansea match and, with Suarez still suspended, we may have only Aspas to play up top and no strikers on the bench this Monday. Sure, you can do a whole lot worse than Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez as your first-choice strikers (I'm being incredibly cheeky right now, I'm fucking thrilled that we have those two). The fact remains that, if we field those two in our first-choice starting XI, we *only* have Iago Aspas as a supplemental option to throw on when in need of an attacking threat in the penalty area. This is why I question the decision to send Borini out on loan -- sure he needed games, but most top sides have at least four players capable of filling in the no. 9 position at their disposal, and at least two available to throw on as subs off the bench. Sending Borini out deprived us of that, and I dispute the notion that he wouldn't have gotten opportunities to develop over the course of a full season if he stayed at the club this year. And what have we seen from Aspas thus far? I'm a big fan and think he has a lot to offer, but just from the sort of game he's exhibited (plus the fact that he's 5'9"" and 150 lbs soaking wet), I question whether he'll be what we need when we're tied 1-1 at the Britannia, Sturridge is out or Suarez is suspended (because of course they are), and we need a physical player in the opposition box to poach a goal and get the win. Borini isn't Didier Drogba, but he's a crafty player in the box -- arguably the best part of his game is the ability to make the kinds of forward runs that free up space for the attacking players behind him. Aspas, for all his promise of being ""able to play anywhere up front"" (how often have we heard that?), has only featured as a second striker in the Premier League for us this season. He hasn't started out wide at all (very surprisingly) and had a run of games this preseason as the furthest player up the pitch, but that was against the likes of Valerenga and the Singapore XI, not Stoke away. I, for one, am eager to see how he does in such a role (and with squad depth as is, he'll definitely get the chance this season). But that doesn't take away the fact that we have only three strikers in the squad, and arguably only one ""true"" out-and-out no. 9 in Sturridge.

**3. Goalkeeper:** This is self-explanatory. Brad Jones, while a wonderful human being and serviceable Championship goalkeeper, is not a Premier League goalkeeper. Rodgers thinks so too, hence the loan bid for Shay Given that fell through. Let us pray for Simon Mignolet's fitness, at least through January, because I'll know I'll be sweating bullets if he's unable to go for us for whatever reason.

Yeah, I care about this shit too much, but don't we all? All that being said, I still feel really good about this squad and feel it'll only get better moving forward. The important thing is that all these needs concern squad depth only; as far as our first XI, the players who we'll depend on most over the course of the season, it's hard to be pessimistic about what we have. As someone put it, it's the first time in a long time that you look at this team and see quality in every position -- in fact, we've already proven that we're a formidable side *even without our best player.* And if (when) Suarez eventually leaves, I'll be looking forward to the prospect of us spending those funds to only further strengthen the squad. Then, we could quite possibly have a very, very, very good football team on our hands.

The time it takes for the pills also confuses me a little, part of the reason I'm reluctant is seeing that the pamphlet of the last medicine said a minimum of 2 weeks is required, and the doctor gave me 2 weeks' worth and wanted to see me after that. I don't see what kind of effect they'd have in 2 weeks if that is the bare minimum time they should be taken. :/

The logic of the doctor is clear though, because the pills could help much sooner than counselling, but I dunno...part not understanding quite how the medicine works and part just being reluctant to go on it because of risk of addiction/the horrible feelings of both mind and emotion/filling my body full of drugs. It's not something I'm totally adamant about though.

There is no matter more important to most suicides than that their attempt is successful.

In asking them to be ""more considerate of others"" you're requesting that they risk failure and end up in an even more miserable existence than the one they tried to escape - in a wheelchair or seriously damaged in some other way.

Suicides only choose to throw themselves under trains because they think it's likely to be the most effective / painless / quick method. 

For all you can say this is a method that is selfish, it only takes one person in a million to disagree with you, or just not care, and we'll see one suicide a week on our railways. So it's a pretty pointless statement.

true,k-dude,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"It doesn't set any precedent because both the law, and my argument in favour of it distinguish riots from normal criminal activities that clearly cannot always be stopped. This is perhaps the most important distinction to make. 

Not only are riots much worse than normal criminal activity in terms of their grand impacts on society, the rule of law and our democracy, they also can be entirely stopped by the police as a riot is a continued public prescence by an unruly group of easily identified people. An average shoplifter or criminal gang evades or bribes the law to not have to meet it. Rioters want to fight the police. It is the raison d'etre of being a rioter.

I share your concerns about internet cencorship and to an extent big businesses' power over government, but please do not equate that issue with this. This isn't a wacky ruling by a maverick lone judge. This is a law that was implemented a hundred years ago, because of a strong argument in favour of it that I think holds true today. This isn't about big businesses manipulating the parliamentary and legal process to get rich at the expense of the state. The vast majority of legal claims to money come from small business owners absolutely devestated by the riots, who have been struggling to survive and as the article said, the companies and individuals aren't even going to recoup their full losses.

Companies and citizens cannot be reaonably expected to make contigencies against riots. They cannot afford the insurance required or the cost of replacing goods, or the uncertainty and fear that the threat of them entails. And as I have already said, they legally cannot create a police or army required to stop them if the state fails to.

In regards to GP surgeries, they are private entities and use their own software, they are reluctant to let hospitals have remote access to these systems but it is improving.

Some areas have worked out remote access to GP surgery TPP SystmOne with the GPs, but you have to go through further roadblocks of getting NHS access cards &amp; PIN numbers, having to specifically ask patients permission to see more of their records when you already have access to all of their hospital records, or record the reason why you didn't ask for permission on the GP system.

true,hylianknight,smith,Smith,"Partly it's meta. Tennant was a huge deal, and he decided to leave with the changeover of show runners and the people responsible for reviving the whole show. So his regeneration gets to be very dramatic.

The other thing is that you have to understand regeneration isn't just a new body, it's a new series of quirks, personality, etc. In short, you're a different you. The best way I've thought about it is, you're a different person than you were 5 years ago. But the change has been so gradual you never notice in the moment. For Time Lords that change happens at a clearly delineated time, where the person you are changes to some extent moment to moment. 

Further there's a bit of fridge-brilliance going on. Besides the fact that any change in general is a much bigger deal before it than after it, 10 has a very unique perspective on regeneration.

Remember The Family of Blood episodes? He's already had the (fairly traumatic) experience of changing from the Doctor to John Smith and back. So he has some notion of what exactly he's facing in that he remember how despite the fact that John Smith was still him, he stopped be himself. While that change wasn't the same as regeneration (i.e. the memory part is a huge deal), it colors his perspective and he's fearful of it. 

Finally, the doctor has had an over millennia long life-span over 11 faces. While I almost get the sense that 11 right now would be more ready for a change after all he's been through the last couple centuries, 10 got a whopping 4 years if we're accepting his self-reported age as the truth. So on top of that experience during Family of Blood, 10 seemed to  be genuinely enjoying this particular regeneration, and I think the notion that his time was up so quickly was hard to deal with because, quite frankly, he wasn't ready to say goodbye. 

So there's my way-to-involved theory. ",0,1379036828,null,0,1379037018,0,cc7a8y7,t3_1m5yfv,t1_cc7a8y7,t3_1m5yfv,null,1429482595,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

But at the time of this post the only regeneration I had experienced was Nine's and they made a big deal about Rose finally accepting he was the same man - so I didn't get it.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"First just to correct and question some things:

&gt;so many countries are fracturing

They are? The only two I can think of that are in any way serious are Scotland and Catalonia both of which have decades of history behind them. Their presence in the news right now is not new or particularly meaningful. Were Germany to split into it's original states and Rome declare independence from Italy I think that claim might be more valid. 

&gt;many of whom are pretty frosty towards the British

Again, is this really true? On what are you basing this? I assume you wouldn't be basing it off pre-modern history where we fought each other to the ends of the earth because naturally this is hugely unlikely to have any effect on other Europeans opinions of us now; if it does affect their opinion they are being quite pathetic and need to try harder to understand modern politics. Instead you must be basing this on recent history in which we have become strong military allies with most of Europe, we have avoided any war within the EU, in which large scale tourism and international workers have become a norm and in which thousands of students travel to other European countries to study. Incidentally many students choose to study here because they have, rightly, a high regard for our universities. I don't really see frosty relations between us and other EU countries, more the biggest revolution in friendliness and co-operation both in governments and among citizens the like of which were unseen in all of the history of the European continent until now.

&gt;relegate ourselves to a backwater...We will have virtually no power...like Greece or Hungary

This is simply not the case. Members of the European parliament represent a broadly similar number of people each. Thus the bigger your population the more people you have representing you. [We have 73 MEPs](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/crosstable.html) along with Italy, France has 74 and Germany has 99. Greece by comparison has 22 as does Hungary. Thus we have more members of the European Parliament than both countries you mentioned put together. Our MEPs have over 3 times more voting power together then either. The same is true of the council of ministers where our domestic MPs get to vote. [We have 29 votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union#Voting_system), Greece and Hungary have 12 each. I'm not picking on these examples for any other reason than you mentioned them but we are among the top 4 most influential nations in the EU because we have a large population. It's simply not true that we will have no influence. 

&gt;to veto our laws

I assume you don't mean our domestic laws made by parliament because that would also be wrong. No single nation or group of nations can force us to drop any law we make. The European Court of Justice however can fine us lots of money for breaches of EU law but this is not a representative of any one nation or group of nations but every member state including us and is manned by judges from here and around the EU who decide if European law has been breached. As I said above we have lots of influence in the making of these laws at EU level so not much gets past without us being OK with it. 

If you want to go and retire in the south of France you can with no significant barriers. If the French government stops you because of your nationality then the ECJ will force the French government to backtrack and allow you to stay. No doubt our government fully supports British citizens who wish to move, live or work in the rest of the EU as is their right and will support the ECJ in ruling on these things. If you want the positive aspects of the EU (which I will get to) you need a body of judges to make sure everyone respects your rights as a European. The UK may be on the bad end of this sometimes but this does not hurt you - it is only meant to ensure you are treated the same way as any other EU citizen is in their own country anywhere in Europe and other Europeans are treated like you. No discrimination based on nationality of an EU country in other words.

Importantly, if there is **no overlap** between the proposed law and European law then **under no circumstances can any person, body, court or other institution of any kind from the EU veto a domestic law made in Westminster. No exceptions.**

&gt;Norway...[is] not at the whims of the unelected EU executive

Again incorrect. If Norway wishes to interact with the EU's single market in any way[ it must adopt the EU laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_%E2%80%93_European_Union_relations#European_Economic_Area) in that area or it can't trade freely. Thus Norway has adopted most EU laws to do with trade just like we have. However they don't get to vote on what new laws are made because they are not members. If they want to trade with the EU they must abide by the laws we, the members, voted for. Were we to leave the EU but join the EEA not many of our laws would change and we would continue to have to adopt EU laws having had no say in what they are. Same is true of any country that wants to trade freely with no trade barriers with the EU. 

&gt;I would like to know why people are so keen on EU integration

OK so - the positive parts of the EU as I see them. 

* The ability to travel around our beautiful continent with no significant restrictions (visas, strict preferential treatment of natives etc).
* The ability to live, study or retire anywhere in the EU with no significant restrictions
* The ability to work or start a business anywhere in the EU with no significant restrictions based on nationality (starting companies can vary in difficulty but will be the same where ever you are from in the EU). The EU provides not just free trade but a single market so most rules should be the same.
* The ability to receive and provide services to and from people in other EU states with no significant restrictions improving competition and lowering prices for me, the consumer. UK competition law is hugely affected by European rules and the EU has encouraged the abolition of monopolies in Europe which corrupt the point of any capitalist system. 
* Benefiting from the EU's commitment to: eradicating discrimination whether racial, sexist or otherwise, the environment including pollution and climate change, and product safety. Incidental, the very important Consumer Protection Act (1987) was outlined in Brussels before being enforced. Look for the [CE symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_mark) on things you buy things to know it meets basic safety standards.
* Benefiting from the European Arrest Warrant meaning criminals from the EU can be arrested here and deported immediately with no complex extradition process. It also means British criminals can be arrested if they flee the country and face justice here (remember one of the 21/7 attempted bombers was arrested in Rome on the basis of a EAW). We also benefit from [EuroPol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europol), greater co-operation between national police forces and the co-operation of UK and French militaries possibly also with nuclear deterrents. 

These are reasons to stay in the EU but many of them are not fully complete yet. You may have seen in the news that the EU wants to abolish roaming fees when in the EU because until that happens people are treated worse when they go to another country. The service industries in many countries including the UK are still very disintegrated and lacking international competition. If the EU stays as it is the common market will never be completed. 

Economic integration on the scale now necessary in the Eurozone is an entirely different ball game and not one many people in the UK want to play, even people who like the idea of a co-operating Europe. However that is a Eurozone problem. No doubt it has not escaped your attention that we are not in the Eurozone and thus it is less of a concern for us. It may have knock on effects but they can be dealt with when they come. We don't have any real obligations to support the Eurozone though it would help us financially if it succeeds.

I beg your pardon?

&gt;cancelled plans always leave a unique feeling of distress (too melodramatic a word, I feel, but I haven't the will to get a thesaurus so it will have to do) don't they though

Hmm, not really, not distress as such, just a bit peeved to get a cancellation pretty late in the day again.

&gt;Is this the same friend who you mentioned the other day about constantly flaking out?

No, I haven't been in touch with her since. This friend is over from the States. We were in Dublin last weekend. May not see him for another five years, shrug. Then again he's obsessed with England so it wouldn't surprise me if he's back within a year or two. No, I have no desire to visit the States. 

&gt;Taking it off with olive oil? So what...you just fill up a pan and dunk your face in? 

HAHAHA, NO. You pour some from a drizzler onto a cotton wool pad. Normal cosmetics usually leave my skin feeling far too dry. 

&gt;What is this eyebrow shape?

A bit bushier and far longer than they currently are. It seems I've been overplucking them for years. It's killing me growing them out, I just want to attack them with tweezers as I've conditioned myself to. So for now I have to fill them in as much as I can with an eyebrow pencil, then use wax on them to keep them in place and wait for them to slowly grow. It's a right ballache being a woman you know. So many things to pluck, wax, paint and exfoliate. If you're curious to know how much of a ballache, pop your head into /r/MakeupAddiction from time to time. The money and time spent by some of those ladies is extraordinary.

&gt;Quite an embarrassment of mine is I have been known to ask my female friends if they may tidy up my brows with a pair of tweezers and the delicate feminine touch. They just seem a bit untidy.

I think it's marvellous that you'd ask. I can't stand monobrows. 

&gt;A friend, eh? ;) right

The same friend who's over from the States, who, last time I saw him, was definitely still gay.

&gt;right, I'm gonna settle this once and for all, women and habitual bloating: what's going on there? Is it just the, er, period stuff?

Yeah, usually mid-cycle water retention. It's pretty normal. You can take pills if you want but I don't take pills unless there's no other option. My stupid period was three and a half weeks late this time (see above re: anxiety) so it's even worse than usual this week. I may also have an allergy to something in bread and probably eat too much of it, but I'm not giving bread up. It's just an absolute bugger how it always seems to coincide with this club night. Well, it stopped, but now by being late it has synched again. I'm taking it as a sign that I'm *never* meant to get together with the only man I'm attracted to at the moment who always goes. 

&gt;That's a good point, I'd not really thought of it like that before, thank you.

It's not your job to know that, it's the doctor's to tell you. Tsk. As someone has mentioned elsewhere in here, CBT would be the best thing (well, preferable - but there are other things, therapy, group therapy, and I'm sure others I'm not aware of), but the waiting lists can be hideous. I know someone who was off the rails depressed and still had to wait six months. That said, it will vary drastically from region to region, so you could be fine and be seen within a month. The pills calmed him down in the meantime.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; In asking them to be ""more considerate of others"" you're requesting that they risk failure and end up in an even more miserable existence than the one they tried to escape - in a wheelchair or seriously damaged in some other way.

That's where you're wrong. If someone truly feels a need to take their own life then I wish them every success - they are clearly troubled enough to feel it is the only recourse and if that line of thought can't be changed, forcing a continued life must be a torturous idea for them. 

However.. 

Any alternative I mention or suggest is one that would be 100% successful. I am not saying ""find something that *might* work"" but ""find something that *will* work"". 

...just don't make it something that affects so many others who - let's face it - don't deserve that trauma. 

&gt; If you cared about suicide on our railways then you'd ask your MP to give suicides a method which was more effective, painless, quick and legal.

One of my other comments here (lost amongst all the conversation, no doubt) mentions my interest in the case of Terry Pratchett - a man suffering from Alzheimer's who is campaigning for the right to legally end his life when he chooses. I strongly support his and others 'right to die' campaigns - though typically those featured in these campaigns have been disabled or diseased in such a way that their quality of life has declined past an acceptable level - not suicidal people in the 'depressed' sense of the term. 

Unfortunately T.P and those like him are not seeing success despite the support of folks like myself (who really have no personal case in favour of a right to die, I am fortunately not disabled in any fashion - but believe someone should have that right). His only recourse at this stage is to seek support from clinics like Dignitas but I believe the current state of play is that anyone assisting him in travelling there would also be arrested under UK law. 

Suffice it to say, I believe in providing every care in either convincing a suicidal person in the value of living on - or in assisting them in a dignified, painless and comfortable death if that is their true desire.

He tops the [Parliamentary nepotism league](http://politicalscrapbook.net/2010/08/somerset-tory-ian-liddell-grainger-tops-parliamentary-nepotism-league/). He gets in because of FPtP. No-one votes Labour here, only Lib Dem or Conservative. As Lib Dems have been weak, the vote will be divided and the Tories here will stay in power again. I'll leave you here his recent comments on people against the badger full: [""I thought most of them were in the habit of lying in bed until the pubs open, or until the postman arrives with the benefit cheque (or do such things get paid straight into their accounts these days?) “Either way, since they are all malingerers and scroungers there is no real incentive to leap out of bed as soon as the dawn chorus strikes up.""](http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/news/somerset_news/10670763.Ian_Liddell_Grainger_defends__scrounger__attack_on_badger_supporters/?ref=twtrec). Because being anti-cull makes you a scrounger, apparently.The situation is the south west is woeful, and it always has been when it comes to privatisations. Train service, what train service? Our lines are the most poorly maintained in the country, the ominous 'buses replace trains at...' is a staple of our news broadcasts - and this is after it was already decimated by the branch line full.We are a forgotten former bastion of mining, and of course that all went under Thatcher. Youngsters have to move away from their childhood towns and villages, not only because there is very little skilled work available, but because the council housing sell-off - coupled with the second lowest average salaries in the UK (first is Midlands where cost of living is significantly less), means young people simply can't afford to live here.The buses are awful. Mine rarely turns up on time, others barely turn up at all. And it costs £5.80 to get into the county town and back (18 miles away), after services were again reduced in 2012 - and I wasn't even at the last stop.When I studied my A-Levels, the nearest school wasn't a few minutes away, it was at least an hour, and that place was unbelievably shitty, so more chose to take the bus to the county town, 75 minutes by bus, 15 minutes walking, to get to school. My former school in the local town is set to be shut down despite good results and having over 100 pupils, and being in demand, so children at the age of 11 will be sent an hour on the bus each way each day to get to a school of 2000.So yes, after all this a few of us here are just a little wary that the exact same thing will happen all over again.",0,1379059523,null,0,false,0,cc7gd53,t3_1m8pm0,t1_cc7gd53,t1_cc771q2,null,1429479742,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I... I don't think that's true. The government are doing their absolute best to keep this bubble at critical mass. 

The help to buy scheme and the way house allowance works both artificially inflate the value of houses. 

Help to buy is allowing people who can't really afford to buy, to buy. 

Housing allowance basically means that any investor can see a return based entirely on what the government pay in an area. 

If the government have said they'll pay up to £1000pcm for a 2 bed flat in a certain area then the minimum price for a 2 bed flat in that area is then effectively set. 

For example, at £1000 housing allowance, 5% mortgage, 10% profit margin for the BTLer, a house is worth £216,000 minimum.

HURRAH! Glad you've seen sense, once the eyebrows begin to look unnatural is when you've gone too far imo. Just stay strong, nouser, it's for the greater good! I've seen some beautiful women do ridiculous things to their eyebrows, a friend once gave herself eyebrows about the size of the average baby's.

&gt;it's a right ballache being a woman...

I'm sure it is, but I shan't go looking for proof as it would probably induce a nosebleed. I'm happy just thinking ""Blimey, women do a lot"". In contrast I've just got a very suspiciously placed tub of moisturiser on my bedside table that I barely use.

&gt;I can't stand monobrows

If I had one, I'd be distraught. My eyebrows are very much a duo, but just quite a messy duo that irked me a little once I'd noticed.

I see, thank you for the information. :) I suppose this varies from woman to woman but to what extent does the bloating (I'm starting to hate the word) go to? With you on the bread issue, I think I eat way too much of it but it's difficult to think of snack foods which aren't carbs or sweets, so I end up eating regular peanut butter or condiment sandwiches. Going to the club would be a much too literal take on ""blood on the dance floor"" but good luck with that fellow!

What happened with your anxiety stuff? Sorry I haven't asked sooner.

&gt;It's not your job to know that...

I will, I mean I don't really interact with anyone in person beyond base pleasantries, if that, from day-to-day so I don't think they'd notice anything even with being aware. Though I am fairly open with these sorts of things, and find it difficult to conceal moods so the people I regularly talk to would still be able to notice I reckon.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"I am from County Durham but I moved south after university. I recently was offered a great engineering job, excellent for my career, about 25% more pay than I'd expect here in the Midlands with extra benefits.

The catch is I have to live in Middlesbrough. I grew up in the North, I know Middlesbrough is a shit-hole. I don't think that a company can EVER entice me to move to the areas where £40k houses are freely available, I know what is there because that's where I grew up.

There is no incentive because these areas get no money and no investment. There is nothing for me in Middlesbrough except a lower cost of living. It is vastly simplifying a serious problem to say ""just move to the north"".

I saw a 3-bedroom Bungalow in my hometown of Stanley for £32,000 a few months ago, but it's a dying town because there is no industry, no money spent and the only people who live there either have been there for 70 years or have no real future prospects beyond becoming a supervisor at Asda.

It's a sad state of affairs for my home region, but until there is some reason to move North, the North-south wealth disparity is only going to get worse.

Personally I think that most of the North-east needs to centralise its population, having so many small towns all a few miles away from each other leads to god-forsaken hell-holes and 1960s urban blight. How you accomplish that I have no idea.

What degree will you be getting in university? Depending on what field you go into, it'll mean the difference between working for 3-5 years in the US or getting your masters and working for 5-10 years in the US before even looking for work abroad.

The way that it would work is that you'd have to get a job offer before moving to the UK. You can't go to the UK to look for work else you'll be kicked out and barred from entry for a few years. In order to get a job offer, if your profession isn't on the [shortage occupation list](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf), the employer will have to prove that there is no one else in the EU that can fill that job before they even look for foreign applicants. And with there being such high unemployment in the EU, that's a tall order to fill, and usually means it's a very specialised job. Therefore, you're looking to want to have a masters and 5-10 years work experience in your field from working in the US. If your profession is on the shortage list, they don't have to prove that there's no one else in the EU, but you should still have a few years work experience because you'll be competing with everyone around the world who will be applying to that job. Also, if it's a field like nurse, doctor, teacher, or the like, you have to make sure that you're qualified to do your job over here.

If you can successfully get a job offer, you can apply for a Tier 2 visa and hopefully there will be no bumps and you meet the other requirements (no major criminal convictions in the past 5 years, $1,500 in savings, the job pays you enough), you'll get the visa. It can last as long as the employer wants it to last, up to a maximum of 3 years. During your visa, you can only work in that job. You cannot get a second part time job as a waiter or bartender or something like that. At the end of your visa, your employer can either renew it or you'll have to look for work. You have 14 days after your visa expires before you have to return to the US.

To get citizenship, you have to have been living in the UK for 5 years straight, with no more than 450 days (about 15 months) away from the UK during those 5 years. You have to pass a test called ""Life in the UK,"" and you have to prove that you intend to stay in the UK.",0,1379064167,null,0,false,0,cc7gwyw,t3_1mal1f,t1_cc7gwyw,t3_1mal1f,null,1429479484,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

In addition, the department reported a **59 percent decrease in officers' use of force** – this with only half the force wearing cameras.](http://news.yahoo.com/body-cams-n-y-c-police-check-stop-220520538.html)",0,1379064716,null,0,false,0,cc7gz0t,t3_1ma11a,t1_cc7gz0t,t1_cc7gcu8,null,1429479458,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The point I was making is that this study does not show otherwise.

Even if driving while using the phone is actually 4 times more risky than average, a 7% increase in calls is not going to cause mayhem on the roads. It might lead to 1% more accidents. That could easily be masked by other variables.

The study tells us nothing, one way or the other.

The amount people (not on benefit) are willing to pay to rent is determined by their earnings, not by what the government tells them is the rental rate in their area. If the council set a high rate, then people will refuse to pay it and go elsewhere. Plenty of landlords would prefer to drop their price than have people on housing benefit. Essentially the rental rates in an area are set by the jobs in the vicinity.

I would be very surprised to find out that the local councils are setting their maximum housing allowances and not monitoring the situation.

edit: just to give you an idea. The maximum for a 2 bedroom house in my area is £507.68. Very few houses in my area have been available to rent at that rate for about 10 years.

3-0 Liverpool

A lot of people go on about Swansea because they play nice passing football but I really don't think they're much better than when Rodgers left. 

They're a well balanced, organised side between both penalty areas but seriously lack penetration going forward (besides Michu who can't be relied on for everything) and not particularly commanding at the back. That's why they were able to completely dominate the game against Man United and lose 4-1. 

We can pass it around midfield better than they can, we can dog out a result better than they can, we can defend and attack better than they can. They have Jonjo Shelvey, we have Steven Gerrard. 

3-0 Liverpool. Then Rodgers can do a lap of honour with his Manager of the Month award and flip the bird to the Swansea fans.",0,1379067060,null,0,false,0,cc7h8wi,t3_1mb16p,t1_cc7h8wi,t3_1mb16p,null,1429479258,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

&gt;  Why should a Polish person be allowed into this country but somebody from India (a country that was under British influence for hundreds of years) be kept out?

I don't think /u/African88 was advocating that an Indian _should_ be kept out. You said that. I don't know where you got that idea from.

&gt; What you are basically advocating is a one world government where we are all under the tyranny of a central government reigning over billions of people.

First, the redditor was arguing for just fewer and larger governments. Second, what makes you thnk a single government would be any more tyrannical than a current national government?

&gt; How can you advocate having a relationship with Russia and then criticise the United States?

I think it was more a criticism of the power imbalance.


&gt; &gt;  *I like the idea of the military safety a Europe-wide alliance brings*

&gt; Does it make us safe? Or does it make us get involved in even more wars because we would basically be a superpower.

Perhaps it makes war between member states less likely.

&gt; I feel like rising living standards, education and technology are changing this more than being part of the EU.

Me too. But being part of the EU makes it easier, I think, to trade with other EU member states; and that helps our economy and helps us to raise living standards.

&gt; If you done away with borders and let anybody into this country you'd quickly realise how important borders are lol.

There's that ""lol"" again. You seem to use it every time you make a point which seems so blindingly obvious to you that it should be obvious to everyone else, so that you don't have to justify it.

I happen to think too that borders are arbitrary and meaningless; that's to say, I don't see any difference between the people on one side and those on the other. I don't think I'm special because I'm from one nation and various other people are from another. They are convenient administrative boundaries, but the nationalism and jingoism associated with them make me feel sick.

Just try to imagine a world where there _were_ no borders, where nobody gave a damn about national sovereignty; where nobody gave a damn about who was in what country and who went where. Where people from the Southern hemisphere could go live in the North just as easily as people from the North of England can go live in the South. How bad would that be really?

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"I think the other factor is the government commitment to getting the borrowing requirement down.  Any capital investment financed through loans would show up on the government accounts, and the coalition is doing everything it can to get the borrowing numbers down.  Even if it could be demonstrated that capital investment would be profitable and pay back over the medium term, if it's still in the red by 2015 then it won't be considered regardless of the benefits.

Ideally, a government owned public body would never have to borrow from a commercial bank, because the government can raise money much more cheaply through the sale of bonds and gilts.  However, when the government is ideologically opposed to this, privatization becomes one of the only ways left to generate funds for investment.

The other factor to consider is unpopularity of using capital investment to replace labour, especially in the postal industry where the Communication Workers Union is very militant.  Capital investment would mean job cuts that would be fought against tooth and nail by the unions and whilst the Royal Mail is under government control that will just mean drops in productivity, wasted money and disruption.  If the Royal Mail is privatized and opened out to competition, extensive disruption will just bring in competition who operate a tougher line against unions.

It already had escalated, by the police! If the thug who wasn't even affecting an arrest wanted a ""word"" he should have walked alongside not aggressing into physical space and if he was to be detained give the verbal order: ""you are under arrest for X"".

Arresting someone for resisting arrest is not a legitimate arrest and you tell me why.

On a side note: why should I allow anyone especially a police officer to put me into a submissive position with no witnesses around in a dark setting? I would have defended myself as well if a policeman thrust his hands towards my throat because that **is the rational thing to do**, to ""[**deflect**] and escape"" (no strikes were made against the aggressor so ""fight"" is an unfair description), but then again that's just me, I didn't pass obedience training and I don't see the police has being a special class of person.

This article seriously misses what the debate is really about. The reason people don't want to build on the green belt is because they want to keep house prices up. The belt in an excuse.

It's hard to argue with this because you've jumped straight to the conclusion, but I can say that adversarial law and current court setup is largely an arbitrary logic and there are many forms the game could take.

The establishment created an expensive system that favoured the rich, even down to the ability to settle out of court, a bribery not available to the poor defendant or a defendant pursued by a spiteful state actor. Another point should be that there exists a legal code so obtuse that even seasoned specialists cannot understand it. If this was a democracy a reasonable layman should be able to have a fair shot at arguing.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"For years I've wanted to live in a high rise building. I originally looked at Beetham Tower in Manchester (the one pictured in this article) but the quality is pretty terrible for the price. Outside of Manchester there's really no other high rise buildings (over 10 floors) unless you go ex-council, which is, uh, let's not go there. The only place to find real high rise is London and jesus fuck the prices are absolute insanity. I was looking at one building, Pan Peninsula, and unless you're spending £2500 per month the only option is a pokey studio flat. Pan Peninsula is incredible though, I was on the very edge of moving into one of the flats but came to my senses when realising 3 years rent there would be enough to buy myself a house in the north. 

I've lived in smaller apartment buildings (a 4 floor and a 3 floor both built in the previous 5 years of living there) and in houses, although yes apartments are very different to living in houses, as long as they're well built there's no real downsides and quite a few upsides. As someone in the comments mentions building upwards in 4 or 5 story buildings would be a suitable solution that works all over the country. I think part of the apprehension people have towards apartments is the idea that they're paper thin walls that don't give you the freedom to fuck at 2am without your neighbours complaining: that might have been true 30 years ago when our parents were around but nowadays it's fine. I lived in a building built in 2007 (aforementioned 4 floor) for 18 months and I only ever heard my neighbours once, well except for the times they knocked on my door to hand me parcels or mention something. Nice people.

If apartments are built and were fairly priced then young people will start moving into them and discovering, oh hey this is actually pretty great. Sounds perfectly reasonable for young people to start out living in apartments and then once they've decided to move forward with their life (and get married or have kids) they can move into a house with a garden and whatnot. Eventually we're going to have to accept that there's no more room for houses, no time like the present!

Spend some time looking at the high density new build housing that is popping up at the moment, I'd take a nice apartment over that any day.

In Cambridge central, I'd give (yet) another vote to Curry Queen - shame they're soooooooo popular, that sometimes we've had to rush when the food's arrived on a busy night, just to make the last train home (before we lived more locally). The Curry Garden on Mill Road is ok, but the staff know they're in a prime Friday/Saturday night post-pub location, and do tend to hover around tables rushing you for your orders.

This would be my top 11 in order of importance, I would argue that our most important player could certainly be Eto'o, as if he can still perform at the top level, his goals will make the difference between CFC being a strong team of title contenders to having the strongest team (on paper) in the league. 

Although we have a wealth of attacking midfield options, I still believe that this could be a defining season for Eden Hazard, and if he can make the step up another level under Mourinho he will be extremely important to our season. The depth of our squad in other attacking midfield options (Mata, Oscar, Schurrle, Willian etc.) means that in my opinion no one individual will define our season, and we could probably get by despite a long term injury to one of them.

Obviously Cech will be crucial to Chelsea's title hopes, of course along with a solid pairing in central defence, in which John Terry seems set to be first choice again under Jose. A good season for Ramires and/or Lampard will also be vital in linking defence to attack.

IMO we have an extremely strong squad on paper, and Eto'o could be the addition which makes the all important difference, however in the words of the late, great Brian Clough, however good your team looks on paper, matches are played on grass....",0,1379072660,null,0,1379072926,0,cc7hyyc,t3_1m6yhn,t1_cc7hyyc,t3_1m6yhn,null,1429478920,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"Firstly It doesn't come out of your personal pocket for Christ's sake. That's a wrong headed way of looking at it from the off... all that clichéd rhetoric does is raise the emotional stakes involved. You are taxed on your ""excess income"", the tax we have is a tax on earning not on being a citizen. Your money isn't taken off you, rather you capacity to earn is penalised beyond a certain point. Someone who has never earnt, and never paid tax, is equally entitled to benefits, it's not a pay in then take out system.

Secondly the question of whether people ""can"" work is another bad question to ask. It's quite clear that ""can"" work means nothing specific here and attempting to delineate who ""can"" work is a waste of time. If there were a huge market in something trivial like remembering the alphabet then everyone with a functioning memory ""can"" work, then again if you're on a an asteroid floating through space nobody ""can"" work. If you ask a Tory their definition of ""can work"" they'll tell you everyone who doesn't qualify for disability or any other other exceptional benefit ""can"" work.

What people who agree with this sentiment need to understand is that JSA isn't there merely as a convenience for good hard working people who are temporarily between jobs. It is the backbone of our welfare state and and acts as a buffer from homelessness and complete deprivation for so many people who don't qualify for other benefits. To be obvious, what if the reason you can't work is because you're simply a 19 year old poorly educated kid dragged up by neglective parents and not even Asda will give you a job? Where is the benefit for social dysfunction? 

Ah but of course in the mind of right wingers utter poverty is what these people need to set them right, right? This completely perverse fantasy that all most the dysfunctional members of society need is the sensation of having absolutely no money put the fear of God in them, and they'll suddenly buck their ideas up and fly right...

It's absurd, putting the onus on personal responsibility just harms many people. It's the equivalent of trying to cure someone's depression by shouting at them. In the old days society looked after ""their own"" through institutions at least, as patronising as they were, with a tacit acknowledgement that not everyone was cut out for a competitive lifestyle, now suddenly unless you're physically/mentally disabled to the point you can be verified by a private agency you are told to work, or at least be subject to a humiliating never ending charade of courses and back to work programmes that will cost you half your paltry benefit to attend. 

What's even funnier is that there obviously aren't enough jobs right now to go around, especially once you've eliminated the non-jobs which are just exploitation of free lancers like door to door sales. The system is built so that the bottom functioning 10% are always going to struggle regardless of whether they classify as ""deserving"" in some fashion.  Right wingers somehow believe that if we take away the ""undeservers"" most minimal level of benefits they'll not only find work, but they'll innovate whole new sections of the economy that will provide the extra jobs need to employ them.

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"If your employer is game, a salary exchange pension might be a good scheme to look at. Typically pension contributions come out of your net salary (after tax and national insurance), and then the tax is ""matched"" at the rate you paid (so it's equivalent to only paying national insurance).  

With salary exchange pensions, your employer draws up a new contract where your wage is reduced by an amount (say 10%), and they deposit that amount as an employer contribution to your pension. The difference is that now you're not paying national insurance or student loans contributions based on that 10%, and, possibly more important when it comes to proposing this, your employer doesn't pay national insurance contributions on that 10% either.  

Downside is your wage goes down, so if you're on a barrier for a mortgage or similar you might want to think carefully (my mortgage accepted my real gross, but some may not). I think the schemes cost money too (but these are typically covered by the employer using the savings they've made on NI contributions, it only takes a few members before they make a profit).

The ceremony its self will be as dull as most religious ceremonies, except chunks of it will be in Hebrew, which sounds like someone trying to get some phlegm out of their throat. That said, it's probably vaguely interesting if only for the alienness of it all. You will have to wear a yarmulke (pronounced approximately ya-mool-ka) (skull cap) but that should be provided, and it may even be a special commemorative one with the names of the bride and groom on that you can keep. Depending on the synagogue, men and women may be separated, and kids usually go with the women (apparently during regular services it's not uncommon for the young kids to bring toys and just muck about, but that probably won't happen (much) at a wedding). I imagine that wouldn't be the case if you were a single dad though, but I don't really know. 

The after party should be a blast! Good food, lots of drink and more vaguely anti-semitic jokes being made by Jews than you can shake a stick at (probably wisest not to make any yourself though... but Jewish humour tends to the self-deprecating)! I have seen Rabbis Cossack dancing, beard sweeping the floor, and a shot of vodka in each hand! (okay it was only one rabbi, and only once, but still - it was an image that stuck with me!) 

Klezmer. It's a type of music. You will not get it out of your head for days. It's really upbeat and bouncy and track Letterbocks posted is a fine example (for a given meaning of ""fine""). The dancing goes in circle with the outer rings moving slowly and the inner rings moving faster. IIRC there will be one ring of men and one one of women, and at some point the bride and groom will be hoisted into the air on chairs in the centre of these rings and paraded around the room. 

If you actually want to know more about Judaism, find a rabbi at the party and get talking (and probably drinking). Judaism is a non-messianic religion (you theoretically have to be born into it, but that can be stretched under the right circumstances) so there's little danger of attempting to convert you, and rabbi means teacher more than priest. They tend to be interesting people. Bear in mind though the old adage that if you get two Jews conversing you will get at least three opinions - it seems to hold true for rabbis at least!

When done well- it results in children who are social, adaptable &amp; can problem solve independently, as well as covering all the curriculum areas- including literacy &amp; numeracy. 

Gove &amp; Truss (education ministers) have said this approach seems too chaotic, and would prefer to see more formal. Which would involve more teacher led, large group instruction. ""Today children we are all doing this...""  Lots more sitting quietly &amp; listening to an adult. So the adults would be making most of the decisions about what resources are used, what, when &amp; how. 

This approach can be handy if you really need to teach a specific piece of information in a limited time (e.g how to use an inhaler) 

The difficulty with this approach is it limits the scope of what can be learnt at any one time, it promotes one specific way of doing things (the teacher) assumes all children are working on the same level at the same time. And doesn't really promote children's own ability to make decisions or learn social skills as well as play.

It can also cause some children to become risk adverse- for example:
If you have paper, pens, paint available in a free play preschool- on any given day children will use those resources for writing, painting a picture of their family, a picture of their recent trip to the park. So the resources are providing an outlet to experiment with equipment and express their own ideas, as well as develop a wide range of skills . A skilled adult would be able to scaffold learning, gradually teaching them how to form their letters and use phonetic knowledge to write words. Because it is gradual &amp; led by the child, they develop intrinsic motivation &amp; build skills slowly and in a way that is relevant to them. 

Compare this approach to ""Today we are going to be drawing cats.""
If a child isn't particularly interested in cats or drawing at that time- they could develop a lack of interest/confidence. If the teacher is also showing how to draw the cat it will also effect that child's creativity. So they might learn a specific way of drawing a cat- but is that really a helpful skill? Especially when compared to what can be learnt in the above example?

It is a lot more complex than that, but essentially one approach is teaching HOW to think &amp; the other is WHAT to think. ",0,1379076531,null,0,1379089163,0,cc7ioun,t3_1m8ffy,t1_cc7ioun,t1_cc6vbt1,null,1429478587,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; The establishment created an expensive system

It evolved to become that. Law is complicated and full of important but really boring little details. The only way to encourage people to spend five years learning this crap is to offer them lots of money. You need to also pay for lots of skilled clerks etc to ensure that procedures are properly followed. If procedures are not followed then the innocent get jailed while the guilty can walk free. 

I work in IT, some parts are cool and fun, some are uber-boring. The dull banking jobs pay the most while ""fun"" things like games pay the least. 

&gt; even down to the ability to settle out of court

Not this argument again :-(. It's the same one as the arbitration debate.

You seem to reject the establishment, something that's basically not compatible with what you just said. Either the government holds jurisdiction over ALL disputes or it doesn't. If it doesn't (which I think you'll agree is the case) then out-of-court settlements are necessary. 

Everything is an out of court settlement. If you agree with me on *any* points here then we just made one. A world where *everything* is settled via a court would be a complete dystopia. Want a discount on a car price? See you in court. Want to negotiate a pay rise? Better phone your lawyer! Mobile phone contract renewal? Break out the summons. 

&gt; Another point should be that there exists a legal code so obtuse that even seasoned specialists cannot understand it. 

Law is complicated because it needs to be. Each case is unique and you simply cannot codify generic laws that make sense in all cases. 

Take a serious crime like murder, on the face of it it's wrong, right? What about self-defence? Where is the line drawn there, at what point can you say you were facing a ""deadly threat""? And of assisted suicide, is that murder? What about an accident that led to a death, is it murder if there was negligence? What if the negligence was intentional to save money as opposed to human error?

Nothing is ever simple. If you do not codify this stuff in law then it leaves judges open to interpret them and they tend to have a pretty shitty record in that respect, particularly for modern technology crimes where 60+ year old judges still struggle to set the clock on their 1990s VHS recorder.

So they're using powers under the terrorism act which allows them to detain people *without reasonable suspicion* of being related to terrorism. Why is that even in the act? Given that only 37 people were then charged with terrorism-related offenses, and 667 were later detained under *other* powers (Why not those first? Maybe because they require reasonable suspicion?), surely that implies that the terrorism act is too broad, and the power should be shifted elsewhere?

Government spending has a multiplier effect attached to it, some spending is efficient and some not, but wealth begets wealth, as London proves.

&gt;If anything generous public sector terms may have sucked people away from riskier private enterprise.

It used to be the case that working in the public sector meant lower salary, better pension. Then private sector wages started to fall and the public sector ended up looking 'lavish' in comparison in both pay and pension.

On the other hand, if youve got some nice big farmers field on the edge of a little village in green belt. No previous shit to consider, farmer wants to sell his land for big monies, local councils are receptive to nice new developments (bigger tax base, more people spending their money locally, more housing)

The whole thing was explaining why that whilst that statement true in a sense it's not a useful line of thought. Saying ""everyone who is able to should work"" is no more helpful than saying ""in a perfectly just society no willfully wicked deed goes unpunished"". Everyone agrees work is good, nobody disagrees with the idea of work being beneficial, and therefore nobody will disagree with that the premise ""everyone who can work should"" (at least at some point in their lives).

But that is nothing to do with reality. Firstly people's capacities are not fixed in stone.  There is no demarcating line regarding what level of capacity constitutes ""able to work"", in fact it's impossible for such a thing to exist. Nor do we have the medical or psychiatric resources to evaluate people in such a fine tuned manner as to know precisely what their capacities are in a reliable way anyway. Some people are just not functioning well, despite not reaching the criteria to be considered mentally or physically unwell, and we need JSA as a buffer for these people. Your belief that long term claimants who don't meet these criteria for being considered mentally or physically incapable for looking after themselves, are therefore defaultly capable of looking after themselves financially and are therefore undeserving is mythos, it's a scale of capacity and not an is or is not question.

""Personal responsibility helps people take control of their own lives."" This is nothing more than your, and many other people's opinion. To assert it as a fact is childishly absurd. Just because many people find an onus on personal responsibility has helped them achieve greater self-control means absolutely nothing  when you're talking about other people's reactions.

My point is the job wouldn't be nearly as lucrative if they weren't trying to offset the sacrifice of having to live in an undesirable place - and it's not working for them, I know they are desperate for competent people who do my job, but they can't entice anyone. The job IS great, but the sacrifice is far too much.

I intended to stop at your first faulty assumption and presumed the rest was going to be as bad. I was right but I guess that makes me a masochist. Dullness isn't proportionate to pay, pay is proportionate to what rich people deem important/lucrative/protective. If the market dictates anything and &lt;1% of the population controls the vast bulk of the wealth, the market will serve that set of interests.

&gt; Not this argument again :-(. It's the same one as the arbitration debate.

No it's not. Beginning criminal proceedings is not the same as haggling over a car. Especially if it is the state bringing the accusations. Settlements can be an escape from precedents. The likelihood of a settlement increases with the size of the defendants bank account, and conversely settlement is decreasingly likely when the well-resourced are spiteful, perhaps seeking revenge or sending a message.

&gt; Law is complicated because it needs to be. 

The law is complicated because it is **made** to be. Corporate law can be quickly thrown out by dissolving corporate personhood. Drug laws? Bye, bye. Much traffic law can disappear by annulling ""careless driving"" and ""dangerous driving"" by falling back on ABH, GBH and negligence. Law is complicated because state-like constructs like to reference ultimate authorities and ultimate objectifications, so in lieu of God or a monarchy (although that still is divined in the UK preposterously) the one true model of reality must exist in prose.

The law is essentially, after the good parts like ""do no harm"", an increasing complex of edge cases designed by the rich to inhibit the poor or make legal the unethical.

&gt; If you do not codify this stuff in law then it leaves judges open to interpret them

That's precisely what happens anyway. [Judges can't even distinguish a two tonne battering ram as a weapon.](http://beyondthekerb.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/what-the-law-told-us-this-week-no-4/) (Notice that is a four parter.)

And if they can pay it, then it's not too expensive. It might cost more than you like, but in that case you're welcome to buy some land, get planning permission, and build a home of your own.

If house prices were high enough that people were being priced out of the market, some landlords wouldn't be able to get tennants. In which case, they'd lower their prices. It's not economically possible for a significant portion of housing to be too expensive if the people letting are doing it to earn money.

Renting isn't as cheap as it gets, unless you have no savings to put down on the mortgage. You can make a few hundred quid PCM renting out a house on mortgage- people do it all the time, it's how retired teachers end up with a 400 property empire and 20 million pounds worth of debt to pay off. If you're working full time on minimum wage then maybe you can't afford that or the rent- but that's why housing benefits exist.

1) Break up plays - more through reading the game and interceptions.

Lucas is great because not only can he read plays and intercept passes, but his *standing* tackle is one of the best in the league.

2) And just as important, if not more important... he needs to be very comfortable on the ball.  Players who were brought up as CBs, I would imagine a lot less have that sort of comfort and skill on the ball than a natural midfielder.  Of course there are exceptions (Agger) but if the DM can't handle holding the ball and recycling it while being challenged in the midfield, that's going to cause some goals

How to fight, how to be a doorman etc are not things you learn on those courses.  You sorta either already knew the former or better get knowing quickly and the latter you pick up on the job.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; Dullness isn't proportionate to pay, pay is proportionate to what rich people deem important/lucrative/protective. 

You say that and yet you think you have the right to be condescending to me? lulz. [This](http://blogg.passagen.se/skoga/resource/rikpic.jpg) is the picture of you I have in my mind. 

Pay is primarily driven by the availability of the workforce. If you can do something that requires a rare skill then you get more. It's cyclic, so high pay will attract people to various professions which results in a negative feedback loop. Occasionally the whole job market becomes saturated and the pay drops to regular levels. 

Take nursing. It's a hugely important job that requires many years of formal training and job placement before becoming qualified. But they get paid a pittance because there isn't a shortage of them. As such a valued role in society there is no shortage of people wanting to do it. 

I'm not saying this is ""right"", it's just how it is. The ""rich people"" pay the least possible for every single job. Every single penny is begrudgingly given, they don't shell out a fortune for lawyers because they see them as rich kindred spirits. 

&gt; No it's not. Beginning criminal proceedings is not the same as haggling over a car. 

Criminal proceedings are not settled out of court so your argument makes no sense. I'm not sure of the specifics in England but here in Scotland prosecutions are brought by the Procurator Fiscal, the police don't even have a say in what gets called. We don't get to ""press charges"" in the UK and shops have little real input into whether ""all shoplifters will be prosecuted"". 

&gt; The law is complicated because it is made to be. Corporate law can be quickly thrown out by dissolving corporate personhood.

While I agree that corporate personhood is retarded if you think that's the extent of corporate law then you just aren't thinking it through. Example: insider trading. At what point does ""inside information"" breach our laws? We need to be specific on these things or CEOs would take the piss even more than they do today as shading dealing would only expose them to potentially favourable judges and their expensive lawyers. ""I misinterpreted the rules"" as the recent American saying goes. 

&gt;  Much traffic law can disappear by annulling ""careless driving"" and ""dangerous driving"" by falling back on ABH, GBH and negligence. 

But we still need to define what is ""negligent"" for a driver. As it stands tuning the radio is legal while using a phone is not. I don't fully agree with that but the fact that it's written down in law means that we as a society can make a decision on it and change it to meet our needs. 

&gt; Law is complicated because state-like constructs like to reference ultimate authorities and ultimate objectifications,

Do you buy into the ""freeman"" thing by any chance? Capital letters etc etc?

&gt; That's precisely what happens anyway. Judges can't even distinguish a two tonne battering ram as a weapon.

It wasn't a weapon, there was no intent, or ""[mens rea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea)"" for it to be considered a crime of violence. By all means argue that negligence like this should be more severely punished but don't imply that there was a deliberate intent to harm. Again, we have detailed laws that differentiate between these two crimes for a good reason. Deliberately using a car as a weapon is a far more serious crime. 

&gt; I'd rather start with the rule that everything is subjective and the law is just a model of reality—a rule of thumb

That's exactly what we did and this is where we got to. It's imperfect but it's best system available. New things happen that weren't codified in law and judges make a fool of themselves. Appeals happen and lawmakers seek to refine the law so that future cases become based on a mix of past-precedents and reasoned debate.

The only viable alternative is to lock a bunch of people in a room and have them clearly define every possible scenario before they happen. That's pretty much the opposite to what you are arguing for.

Law is complicated because it needs to be. We should not be contemplating locking up people for ten years on a whim. ",0,1379081967,null,0,false,0,cc7k525,t3_1m9u43,t1_cc7k525,t1_cc7jhig,null,1429477908,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

i've dealt with this kind of thing before, as the person who creates something and it is missold and repackaged (not fonts). It is easier to deal with it privately than make a song and dance - which is all this is imo.

no one gives two shits about his font or his work, no-one in their right mind would think that he morally vetos what message or design his font is to be used for everytime someone 'licence' it, especially when all he will see is the occasional paypal from fontsRus or whoever is kiting the font for sale.

As an aside if you are willing to say you'd rather not see ugly / obnoxious people then what right have you to complain when anyone here takes issue with anyone seeking to hide their face - having grown up in a culture where this practice is frowned upon? 

Speaking of imposing on a culture... we're still in the United Kingdom, the last time I checked.

I agree with their diagnosis of the problem, not necessarily their solution. I'm sure if they had the money they could find a lawyer capable of exploiting some legal grey area, or pay enough and change the law entirely. I'm not sure how much I'm joking there...

true,Letterbocks,null,/u/petersutcliffe was here 2k15,"Hey Tophatjester. Good luck with the getting help for your depression. I guess I'll inform the answer to your question with a bit of relevant info about meself. I'm 30 now, and basically have spent the latter half of my 20s struggling with some fairly profound mental health issues. It had kinda always been this festering dysphoria with life, fitting in and generally making headway in the world which I'd felt since a teen. At the time I put it down to teenage angst, being far too invested in 'the big picture' and being a 'sensitive soul' to explain why I was so bitter and apathetic about the whole life thing....

My late teens and twenties were a total hedonistic blur, as I masked and avoided this sense of bleakness, inability to fit in and make sense of the world with enough drinking and drugging to make anyone's liver squeal in horror. 

Eventually having fucked up so much and so badly that my career was fucked, job,car, flat and SO lost and after my self harm and my abuse issues were totally out of control I sought or was impelled to seek help. 

Thereafter, I still had a bunch of rocky stuff to cope with, my MH was worsening still and I had a few episodes of psychosis and a couple of fully legit ending myself attempts. It was not an easy time for me or my family....

(ok, don't worry this is where things get less miserable!) 

So fast forward to about 2 years ago, I finally got a GP who I was comfortable with, who was prepared to offer counsel frequently and with an open mind and I finally got a diagnosis that made sense and got put on some medication that seemed to work (at least in the eyes of others - I still felt completely bonkers and now just felt tired all the time and gained a fair few lbs - so I looked normal human weight rather than junkie size!)...I think i've been on the meds about two years now, and have gone from being totally dysfunctional to working regularly in a volunteering position, doing placements and courses to get me back into work and slowly becoming the employable, smart motherfucker I know I can be.

How am I? I'm still pretty much a depressive personality, I still despair at humanity, I still struggle often to indulge in light conversation when my mind is full of stormy clouds, I still go up and down like a whore's drawers and I still am a pretty naughty boy. HOWEVER, I've not self-harmed in almost 2 years and the thought of that is incredibly alien to me now, as is suicide. I have flashes of clarity often where I realise I am being a productive, confident and assertive person now and then and secretly I brim with pride. Not because I think I've got it all sorted now - I haven't and I don't know if I ever will, but I'm trying and that effort doesn't feel completely futile all the time.

I don't know why I spilled this big ramble to you mate, and I'm not sure how much I'll agree with it upon re-reading, tomorrow, in a week or in a month. I guess I just wanted to offer insight into another dude who has struggled with depression/MH issues so you know it happens to lots of us, and it's shit, and we shouldn't be ashamed to talk about it.

On that note, if you ever need a friendly ear about that sorta stuff, or just a friendly ear to explicitly NOT talk about that sorta stuff you can shoot me a PM anytime.

Treat yourself kindly, dude. The universe smiles back at you when ya do (sometimes!)

Seriously?!? There isn't a massive difference between wearing a balaclava or hoodie (I'm assuming in a threatening way, I've never been thrown off-campus for wearing a hoodie) and wearing the clothes that you wear at home, you've worn for most of your life, and the clothes that you feel most comfortable in.  
  
Policies forcing women not to wear a veil are discriminatory because they breed social isolation. They make people feel unwelcome and give closet racists and bigots a reason to pick on people.  
  
Also, this is not a feminist issue. Many Muslim women feel more empowered wearing the veil because of the level of objectification in Western culture, which I think most people agree is a bad thing. It's not just about men ""hiding their women"" from the world, but often a conscious, personal decision to wear a veil, and often a very hard one to make.

Yes, and the synergy is not exactly perfect - as keeps being shown. I have no problem with other cultures. I have a problem with other cultures getting preferential treatment. 

Suppose  50,000 civilian British people moved to Pakistan and demanded we be allowed to do what we like - and to bring our own law with us. Do you think it would go down well? Do you think the indigenous population would view it as 'fair' if the government of Pakistan allowed it? 

&gt; nobody under the age of 50 cares much about Christianity. 

Wow, sweeping generalizations ahoy, Batman! 

I'm not Christian. I was actually put off Christianity when I was at school. But a vast majority of the country does rate itself as Christian. The next largest majority is non-religious people. It's certainly not Islam. Again, why would the majority of people be glad to see the preferential treatment of a minority who demand that everyone else concede to what they want? That does not make sense. 

There's a difference between making room for others and what they believe... coexistence... and having to bend and shrink your own principles in the name of multiculturalism and inclusiveness. 

&gt; And next time you're on your way to a fancy dress party be grateful that we live in a country that doesn't care what you put over your own face.

The next time I try and wear my pumpkin-head mask to a business meeting, into a bank or to collect children from a school with it - and demand to be taken seriously - I'll let you know how that goes. Or we could insist that burqas only be worn to fancy dress parties - that would make it even.

true,smaclver,null,null,"Yeah of course, even the best defences concede chances and occasionally concede goals. That's why you need a good goalkeeper, and a focused one too. 

When Mignolet signed for us a lot of people wrote about how he had a great save % but would he be able to maintain that focus in a team that doesn't concede a chance every 42 seconds like Sunderland do. I never really saw that happening though, I read up about how he behaves on and off the pitch (one story being that when he signed for Sunderland they asked him what colour he wanted his company car in, he responded by asking where he and his girlfriend could study for their History degrees).

He's clearly a very focused individual, so when we make those mistakes (like the Agger penalty, or the Benteke chance where Agger cleared poorly then got caught under the ball) he's been there, focused and ready to bail him out. In hindsight it's easy to say that all he had to do for the Stoke pen was remember the research the GK coach had (almost certainly) given him on Walters aiming his penalties bottom left. But imagine the pressures that come with your Anfield debut and how easy it is to forget, or doubt the information you've been given in that situation. Ultimately he made the right decision and was rewarded for it. 

Sometimes you concede chances just because what the opponent does is too good. Take the late Van Persie chance last Sunday (our defence got sucked in, VP span in behind and I think Hernandez threaded a great ball through). Maybe it was just luck but I can't help think that Van Persie would've stroked that in comfortably on a good day.

&gt;""When he was a young player, he was the No.9 so he can play in the central striking role or can move. In any one of those top four positions, he's comfortable.""

I've made a point of whether Liverpool have adequate options at striker; with Borini out on loan, we have only Sturridge, Suarez and Aspas. While that may look good on paper, consider that, with Suarez suspended and Sturridge a match-day decision for Swansea, we could very well start Aspas at the 9 and have no other natural options on the bench. You also have to consider the kinds of players they are (Sturridge is the only ""true"" out-and-out no.9, capable of reliably and consistently poaching goals in the box, that we have), and whether the sort of looks we're able to throw out on the field are limited. In any case, a first XI featuring Suarez and Sturridge would leave only Aspas on the bench to throw on if we need a goal.

My question is this: I haven't seen very much of Moses, but do you think he's a viable option as the furthest player up the pitch? Rodgers says it's a role he's familiar with, but that seems to hearken back to Moses' youth days. I certainly think it's a position that could use more options, and Moses does appear to be the sort of physical player who can cope up there, but have any of you seen him do it?",0,1379087110,null,0,1379087785,0,cc7lvnh,t3_1mbj38,t1_cc7lvnh,t3_1mbj38,null,1429477096,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

I merely suggested that is might not be right thing to stress for everyone who is on JSA by trying to force them off it as they are currently.. so so much for your *scholarly articles*. 

Also I'm completely sure that if the authors of mental health rehabilitation articles knew you were quoting them for social policy they'd tell you you're a fucking crank anyway.

What is the definition of misogyny? I've genuinely become quite confused recently about its actual definition, perhaps spurred on a bit by this song.

The video is undoubtedly sexist. But, depending on your definition of misogyny, it is or isn't.

I've always understood the traditional definition of misogyny to be 'the hatred of women' - of which I don't believe this video to be. However, most people using the term 'misogyny' nowadays use it in a context of 'prejudice against women' rather than a hatred of them. In that case, the video (and song) quite probably is misogynist.

Murder isn't a problem because the vast majority of humans are not murderers. 

Corrupt police are not a problem because the vast majority of police are not corrupt.

You live in Hertfordshire. I live in Birmingham - where this college is based and where you'll find the greatest cultural diversity in the country. 

On my road there are two shops - one run by a Muslim and the other not. If you buy alcohol from the non-Muslim shop and carry it into the Muslim run shop to buy some dinner before going home - it will be commented on.

Mignolet; Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Enrique; Gerrard, Lucas; Henderson, Coutinho, Moses; Aspas

My reasoning: I really think we should refrain from overworking Sturridge. His fitness record over the course of his career is far from spotless, and we've already seen issues crop up this season. Muscle injuries are really tricky, and I really don't think we should risk further aggravating this thigh problem, especially with Suarez out for a few more matches. Swansea has nowhere near the most physical back line we'll see this year -- probably the least physical we've seen thus far, actually -- and I really think Aspas should be given an opportunity to show what he can do at the 9, which is where he played for Celta most of last year. Sturridge wasn't even training today; even if he's good for Monday, I say we keep him on the bench. If we need him, we can throw him on in the second half. Of course Brendan will know what's best for both the team and the player, but I think we've been relying on him far too heavily so far.

Other than that, I doubt Moses will need any time to settle; if he does, Sterling can certainly play on the left. With Aspas up top, Coutinho is free to play behind him centrally in his preferred position. And Hendo can keep doing what he's been doing on the right.

If you want people running government that are in any way the equal of those in the private sector, you have to go for private sector levels of pay. If you decided you could do just as good a job as your CEO, and therefore he can receive the same pay you do, you're a) going to lose him and b) get someone rubbish in place.

You can argue the moral point over people working for people and not money, but the above can be see at any local council/ hospital/ etc. - why do you think they have to bring in contractors to get stuff done, or done properly? It's (primarily) because if they pay the wages they should, they then have to pay the other stupidly-low-paid-staff the same, which they can't afford because of their own rules.

Why do you think doctors (for another example) aren't paid the same as nurses? I mean, they all work hard, don't they? Why do private doctors get paid so much more? They're all just doctors after all, aren't they?

What about presenters/ actors at the BBC? Do you think they'll get the same quality if they insist on paying a lot less than those presenters/ actors will get from Sky or what have you?

There are plenty of other examples, but my original post was pointing out that private sector bosses tend to have expenses (and wages) that are a lot, lot higher than MP's.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Yes it was, read the comment above mine.

Repeating your interpretation doesn't move anything forward. Spending every single penny you earn before finding out you can't pay your rent doesn't somehow make it a good idea to do so.

&gt;The person above was implying that no matter how you spent your money before you became unemployed, that activity becomes state subsidised the moment you start claiming benefits.

Not to me. To me, he was illustrating that blowing what little money you have when you are working doesn't mean that it's a valid option because the state will carry you once you're out of work, because 'why didn't you save money when you had it' then becomes a valid question.

&gt;If you want to argue their idiotic position, please do so with them.

Making your reply utterly pointless. The 'I'm right, this discussion is ended' ploy still doesn't work, even after all these years...but never mind, you're demonstrably only here to repeat your opinion instead of have a discussion.

Have a great weekend :-)

I trust the club regarding KDB. I trust them letting Moses go, I never really thought he'd be more than a Geremi at our club. He's plus points are largely the same as Willians so he'd be used similarly tactically which doesn't really change KDB's role in the squad.

As for the supercup game, Jose said that he wanted pace and that's why KDB didn't play, hence the starting lineup.

As for agreeing with your opinion, I don't, I think it's far too premature to be making guesses like this. If Oscar gets injured or Mata gets injured he'll probably get a string of starts as well as just rotation. The only areas of the squad I'm worried about are DM and ST.

What I fail to see is why cost cutting measures aren't implemented with regard to travel, accomodation, staffing etc. As highlighted, costs have increased significantly since the scandal came about, suggesting no one really gives a shit that they're all doing so on the back of taxpayers.

Are you being serious?

They **are** isolated! 

&gt; They make people feel unwelcome

People wearing the Burkha should be made to feel unwelcome. When you cover your entire face, you are not welcome to the majority of people that do not.

&gt; Many Muslim women feel more empowered wearing the veil because of the level of objectification in Western culture

Empowered? I'm sure being almost completely ignored by any non-Muslim is incredibly empowering. 

They feel empowered because of the view some Muslim men have toward women. They are subjected to this shit, so dressing like a human postbox gives them some self-esteem in their otherwise shameful lives.

&gt;  It's not just about men ""hiding their women"" from the world

Yes it is. It's always about men projecting their view onto women. This is the case in most societies, but especially prevalent within Middle Eastern cultures.

&gt; but often a conscious, personal decision to wear a veil, and often a very hard one to make.

Well let's make it easier for them, and ban the face veil from public buildings.

true,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"As I said, I'm a student so I haven't been out on the front, so I'm going off of what my lecturers have said (who it is worth noting are not what you would call Gove supporters), as well as some early stage reading. I'm also in Wales, so what I say may not be applicable in London.

The difficulties with outdoor education have been a combination of available space and staff resistance. Many schools are just not equipped with spaces suitable for the project, so to get out there and do it the administration is much more of a nightmare, and thus less frequent. Meanwhile, many staff struggle to cope with poor weather, themselves not wishing to get wet but also worried about the reactions of parents if kids go home with wet socks and the like (which would apparently be a non-issue in much of Scandinavia). Also, letting kids manage their own risk, particularly at a young age, is somewhat of a culture shock for some staff, with parental reactions again feared. **I'm not saying that the system is a failure**, simply that early studies have shown wildly different results from Scandinavia, particularly when it comes to the teaching itself.

As for the school-start issue... Perhaps the figures are different in England than to Wales (well I know they are as I've seen them, but I don't know how they translate as relative problems), but the basic communication issues at school-entering age are something that are a massive problem that are being talked about in Education research. Perhaps this is something that *can* be worked on even with 'informal' schooling, but there is still seen to be a need for basic literacy and numeracy within this early timeframe, as I said before because without these skills, it is very difficult to develop other areas of the curriculum without them.

Am I simply passing on the beliefs of my lecturers at this point? Almost certainly, because my real-world experience is limited to about 2 weeks of volunteer work before my course started, and I've hardly scratched the surface of the literature. That being said, Wales now has replaced KS1 with a 'Foundation Phase' from 3 to 7, which perhaps has 'informalised' early years already. 'Learning through play' is a key slogan of this new system.

I'll agree that I've heard no support for Gove, anything but from my lecturers so far.

I know people like to claim it's a hard sport to get into, but the absolute worst case most difficult thing you have to do is join a shooting club. Membership to a shooting club allows you to apply to add all sorts of fun rifles to your certificate that you otherwise can't really justify.

Under the section *What is the background to this?*, they state;
&gt;""A significant proportion of students and the wider population hold dangerous victim-blaming views about women who experience rape and sexual violence...  Following sexual violence on or near campus, our institutions and the police are still telling women to change their behaviour - i.e. do not walk alone, get a taxi etc.""

which, as an individual point in that list, sounds a lot to me like the vilification of common sense, i.e.

 ""I shouldn't have to lock my car doors, thieves shouldn't steal cars.""

What EUSA are trying to do is laudable, but I think their approach to the problem will not make any difference to society as a whole and instead makes EUSA look ridiculous.  

I'd be interested to know whether EUSA maintains a list of banned songs (and texts) - or whether this was a spur of the moment decision by some official that's being backed up on principle by Kirsty Haigh.  

Let's apply the same idea uniformly across university life - that misogynistic cultural products are to be banned from all university premises - then surely there are some works of philosophers and social scientists that should not be studied at university, because that course material *'enables rape culture'* and offends people.

Also the veil is more complex than that, I'm sorry. It's not just because middle eastern cultures are sexist, though many are. Often it is about a rejection of western ideals of beauty and the sexualization of women. Now I'm not denying it can indeed be used as a method of domestic abuse, but there are strong single women who wear veils too, even those well separated from their communities. It can't all be put down to ingrained abuse, when there are strong, independent women wearing veils every day proving this wrong.

Guess what the score of the game will be in a reply to this comment.

I will post the winner(s) in the Post-Match Thread.

If you get the score right, you get a point. I'll make a league throughout the season.

I couldn't speak for all white collar workers but as I wear a suit to work - I can answer that I don't feel oppressed. Furthermore my colleagues and anyone I interact with personally whilst representing my business can see my face. 

Stop and think for a moment about how much can be conveyed with a facial gesture. When someone is being dishonest, it's their eyes that often give them away. If you want to see someone's true intentions, you don't look at their hands or at their feet - you look at their face. 

Therefore your comparison of the wearing of a suit and covering ones entire face is inappropriate. 

&gt; Show me where Sharia law is being practiced in the UK.

Did you not read the link I posted? 

&gt; I lived in Erdington as recently as 6 months ago. There were at least a couple Muslim owned shops selling booze on my road.

Congratulations, my first hand experience from *right now* says differently however. 

&gt; but it doesn't help anybody to force them based on your personal preferences.

Quite the contrary, it helps me and other cases - it helps huge swathes of people. 

Examples? You only have to look at the historical mistreatment of minority groups: black slaves, women who were not allowed the vote, victims of being stoned to death (still practised in some cultures today, for some reason we accept this). 

There are *plenty* of people who could be helped and *have been helped* because someone forced their personal preferences. ",0,1379094343,null,0,false,0,cc7oip9,t3_1mbafd,t1_cc7oip9,t1_cc7mekg,null,1429475865,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Search for 'flair' and from three months ago you'll find some screen shots. 

&gt;Good call to not get in touch I'd say, I knew a lass who seemed to decide whether or not meeting up was feasible an hour or two before the arranged time to meet. I think my record with her was a run of 4 consecutive no-shows, which is a pity because 2 more and I got a toaster

Wtf? I hope you dumped her (friendship) arse. I don't get the toaster reference.

&gt;HURRAH! Glad you've seen sense, once the eyebrows begin to look unnatural is when you've gone too far imo. Just stay strong, nouser, it's for the greater good! I've seen some beautiful women do ridiculous things to their eyebrows, a friend once gave herself eyebrows about the size of the average baby's.

The trouble is, even though my hair is now a really dark shitty blonde, my eyebrows have always been quite light. But I suppose they've darkened over time. Now, I've never quite had bitch brows, but I'm slowly learning the art of growing them out AND filling them in. It just seems to make your face a bit more complete. Honestly: I'm really shit at being a girl. I was always a tom-boy. I resented having to use handbags until I was in my mid twenties. I have a LOT of lost girly time to catch up on. I also massively over plucked them on the morning of my wedding and couldn't bear to look at the photographs after that. The makeup lady really told me off, but she didn't do anything to bloody fix them.

&gt;In contrast I've just got a very suspiciously placed tub of moisturiser on my bedside table that I barely use.

Oh aye? Is it Clinique? I'm sure if you searched hard enough you could find a man who uses Clinque as man funtime lube. 

&gt;I doubt that's much of a hurdle for you.

He's been gay for 12 years and I don't find him attractive. Only 5ft 8 you see. 

&gt;I suppose this varies from woman to woman but to what extent does the bloating (I'm starting to hate the word) go to?

With me, it's the difference between having a relatively flat tummy to looking six months pregnant. I can put on and also lose half a stone in weight in the space of a week. 

&gt;Going to the club would be a much too literal take on ""blood on the dance floor"" but good luck with that fellow!

We discussed blood earlier. Pah, I don't think anything's ever going to happen, it's been going on for well over a year. Also, we have mutual friends and those types of setups are often messy/awkward. Also, he's 5ft 7. OH JUST SHUT UP! I'm sure you have your types too, tsk. 

&gt;What happened with your anxiety stuff? Sorry I haven't asked sooner.

Getting the form back to them filled me with so much anxiety (fax us!) that I got stressed to near boiling point and threw it in a drawer. It has sat there since. I still have to deal with it at some point because I cope terribly when things are bad. Lash out at those undeserving, repeat old bad habits, etc. Still, could be worse. I have a friend who's on pills for anxiety because he kept punching walls in his own house. Now that his life has settled down a bit, he's fine. That's what I need really: things to settle down a bit. Too many areas of uncertainty, and as I'm a bit of a control freak, that's never going to go down well.

&gt;give yourself a hug from me.

Give yourself a hug back.

The Doctor was fighting in the war, which would imply that at the very least he has a full new set of 12 regenerations (addition to the 11+ he's already used). If what I remember is right, and they simply lifted the restrictions on regeneration, instead of just giving more of them, and that lift was supposed to last for the duration of the war, then the Doctor, who escaped the war (though the war goes on inside the time lock, right?) would return to having his genetic number of regenerations (500?) instead of the limited 12.",0,1379097613,null,0,false,0,cc7pp5v,t3_1m8sb6,t1_cc7pp5v,t3_1m8sb6,null,1429475244,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
