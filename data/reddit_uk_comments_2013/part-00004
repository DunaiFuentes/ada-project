Honestly I found it hard to take anything written after this seriously, I think objectivity is something that should always be strived for, but even more so on an issue as important as the potential/literal abuse of children.  As an example it seems quite plausible to me that the demonisation of paedophiles drives them underground and less likely to seek treatment/therapy and therefore more likely abuse children. If the hysteria around paedophilia is actually making children *less* safe then surely its indefensible but we can't know unless we're objective about the issue.

&gt;This is a plea for tolerance to be shown towards something that is utterly undeserving of tolerance.

Why pay 150k per week on a player who is injured 1/3 of the time when you can split that 150k per week amongst 2-3 young + talented players. IIRC, Mata is currently making 55-60k per week.

Then when Churchill had to blow up the French ships during The Battle of France to stop them falling into the hands of the Germans, we got blamed and made out as if France would've won otherwise. Even after WWII, France were going to supply Argentina with more Exocet missiles. Then the food and drink comparisons, etc.

There are just different levels of illegality. From full on piracy up to legal ownership (but violating the T&amp;Cs).    

The easiest way is to use a VPN. You connect to a server located in the US and can then use sites like Hulu, Netflix (US), CBS, etc. There are many companies offering this and you can roll your own with something like AWS if know how.    

You can also buy iTunes (US) gift cards, set up an iTunes (US) store account, and then buy things without even needing to use a VPN. You just open iTunes, select the TV show and hit buy. It is as simple as that.    

But you need a reliable source of gift cards (and companies selling gift cards often use stolen credit cards to buy them, it is a form of money laundering, so be careful - your account might get suspended).

true,JimmerUK,null,null,"Yep, I was trying to figure out how they costed the £80k but the only reference appears to be ""The cost of running the government car, which is largely used by Burns, is more than £300 a day.""

So at five days a week at £300 a day it comes out as £78000. 

But he's using it for commuting only. 

His house is just under an hour from Liverpool Street Station, according to Google Maps, let's double that to overcompensate for traffic and it comes to 1h45m. Double it again to account for his return journey home and you have 3h30m. 

Let's assume Burns works 9-5, an eight hour day. The car would therefore have to be operated for at least eleven and a half hours, let's round that up to twelve hours for argument's sake. The car costs £300 a day to run.  

So, we've deduced he uses the car for less than a quarter of the time it's available,  29% in fact. 

29% of £78000 is £22620, and that's massively overcompensated.

A yearly season ticket from Chelmsford to London is £3540. A yearly travel card is £4472. Total train cost: £8012. 

So he's not ""costing the taxpayer £80,000"", he's only ""costing the taxpayer"" £14,500. Considerably less. 

Let's also take into account that he doesn't claim for a second home in London, which he's entitled to, and this whole thing doesn't look so bad at all. 

Why would the DofT have two pool cars if no one should be allowed to use them?

I do wish the media wouldn't treat everyone like idiots and actually told us the facts rather than sensationalising *every god damn thing*. 

**EDIT:** Also, let's assume the trains and road traffic are running at optimum. The optimum car journey is about an hour. The total journey by public transport is about an hour too. However, in the car he's working a full hour (supposedly), on the train he could only work for the 35m journey between Chelmsford and Liverpool Street, as working and trying to travel the tube and buses is not feasible. 

So travelling by public transport would in fact lose him an hour a day. 

Let's carry on assuming he only works 9-5, eight hours a day. That's 2080 hours a year. He earns £98,740 a year, which works out at £47.50 an hour. £47.50 an hour, lost every working day is a cost of £12,350. 

So, if we wanted to be really pedantic, he's only really costing the taxpayer £2150. ",0,1357558928,null,0,1357559827,0,c7sjzme,t3_1641l5,t1_c7sjzme,t1_c7sjq4h,null,1430883312,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,charliedouglas123,null,null,"For those wondering he used the car 154 times in ""less than a year"".

Let's say that whenever he used it he went both to and from work with it so that is 77 trips in a 365 day period (let's make it easy for the numbers).

That's him using the car 22% of the time (if the car was used solely for him on those days). This is a cost of **£17,600** for him to get to work and back on those 77 days or **£230 a day**. If the car was used more on those days then that goes down.

Don't get me wrong, it's shocking that the Transport Minister is using the car when there is a far cheaper (and quicker?) option available but it isn't as bad as the articles are trying to make out.

I think your maths is slightly off though, you're dividing the total cost of the car over 77 days but he doesn't use the car all day only to commute. 

Using my hourly figures and the fact that he used the car 154 times we can look at a more realistic figure than the £80k everyone's been fooled believing. 

154 journeys, either to or from his home would take an estimated 1h45m each. That's a total of 269h30m. We'll round that up to 270. 

In my other post I estimated that the car would be run for 12 hours, at a cost of £300, or £25 an hour. 

So he's only costing the taxpayer £6750. Considerably less than £80,000.

I know it's easy to step back and say: ""look at this hypocrisy"" but there is a definite difference between being slapped on the face and slapped on the backside.

Being slapped on the backside has a cultural connotation of a mentor disciplining someone to correct undesired behaviour.

Slapping someone on the face is an act of aggression intended especially to humiliate the target, it is an emotional response of anger.

The difference is in the intent.

There was a long and thought provoking post on Reddit about why slapping is so powerful and far less likely results in escalated violence than say, punching. I wish I could find it, it was far more eloquent than I could be.

I'd like to remove my personal opinion on whether slapping backside/smacking/corporal punishment is acceptable and just say that a great amount of people DO think it is good discipline

The fact of living in any sort of community with others (in this case, a country) means you have to accept a majority opinion defines the law and morality of that community.

TL;DR - Slapping the backside is for discipline, slapping the face is an emotional angry action. **some** people see one as acceptable discipline (controversial), the other is never acceptable and child abuse.",0,1357562864,null,0,false,0,c7skghy,t3_1645mv,t1_c7skghy,t1_c7sjwsv,null,1430883542,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

There are of course handfuls of idiots, just like in any country, who truly hate just about any foreign country out there but it's a very British thing to throw insults and jibes around without any hard feeling meant at all.

And add to that the hundreds of years of real rivalry in the past as two of the major players in Europe and the colonial era, and our very intertwined past, it gives us plenty of material to use in this banter.

If there really was a genuine national hatred it would make itself very apparent in all dealings with each other.

I've been to France several times and aside from a few arsy Parisians, who I can understand being a bit curt as it's pretty much the same in any city with a lot of tourism (it's their home and people wandering around with tourism pamplets and speaking broken French from phrasebooks is only going to make getting home from work more of a chore), I've never been treated unkindly there. I sincerely doubt that any French people who visit the UK would experience anything worse than a bit of lighthearted ribbing, and that only once you get off the beaten tourist tracks (outside the centre of London). We're only separated by a few miles of sea, we get plenty of people from France working, studying and visiting so it's not as though meeting someone French, or a Francophone from any other country, is an oddity.

I don't know how any reasonable, sensible adult can accept that it is correct to hit a child in punishment/anger and yet at the same time reinforce the **fact** to that same child, that hitting others is wrong, not accepted in society, and illegal.

There are so so so many other options for controlling a situation where a child is misbehaving. 

Yes, it could be argued that a quick, easy control mechanism is negative reinforcement - i.e. ""Little Jimmy, if you run into the road I'll whollop your backside"" but countless studies have demonstrated that this is a short-sighted and weak approach that will not positively adjust behaviour in the long-term.

I suspect there will be many replies from people who were ""whacked"" ""spanked"" or otherwise subject to physical punishments as children, and claim to be well-adjusted, decent adults. Fine.

Frank Lampard is an absolute stalwart Chelsea legend who has shown nothing but commitment and passion for the club on the field since his debut in 2001.  That he has upset the management in negotiating his worth is his business and who would not try and negotiate the best terms in his position?

As for Drogba, he never wanted to play for Chelsea and admitted this in his 2008 biography (published in French)

He goes as far to admit that he was disgusted to sign for Chelsea.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  I'm sorry but I disagree with you there. Modern diesel engines are far more complex than their petrol counterparts. And far more expensive when they go wrong.

No they're not. 

&gt;  They may have no spark plugs, but what about higher pressure injectors, diesel particle filters, 

Petrol  have high pressure injectors and catalytic converters with oxygen sensors. In addition they also have coil packs which diesels don't have.

&gt; Exhaust gas recirculation systems, dual mass flywheels,

So do petrol cars.

&gt; increased torque on clutch and gearbox components, 

They always have but that just requires stronger bearings etc. It isn't a problem as plenty of petrol powered turbocharged cars have proven.

&gt;  and almost always turbocharged.

All of Fords petrol Ecoboost cars are supercharged. How the fuck do you think Fords 1.0L  petrol engine manages to move a Ford Focus at any speed other than glacial? Virtually all petrol cars will be supercharged or turbocharged within a few years in order to allow manufacturers to produce ever more fuel efficient low emission cars with usable performance.

You obviously have no clue how a turbocharger works if you think it adds any level of complexity.

&gt;  However there are a lot of drivers who go out, buy a diesel because of the tax band, drive 3/4 of a mile to the shops twice a week, and complain that the DPF is clogged up after just 9 months of ownership.

He had been there for around 10 weeks before amazingly becoming manager and it was common knowledge that the dressing room was internally running itself. As for Scolari, he openly criticised Drogba from the beginning and requested his sale, it's not like Didier was stubbornly holding on to some tenuous grasp of his own self worth. He also didn't hold the club to ransom over a new deal, even Peter Kenyon makes this distinction when discussing the biggest personalities in the dressing room. The difference with Lampard is that he has become less loyal over time, first with the Inter mess and now this. While he didn't have the easiest beginnings, neither did Ashley Cole for that matter, he became a legend to the fans while in the background playing the hierarchy to suit his own ends. Did you see Didier complaining to the press when a £50m striker came in, when said striker was given game after game despite no results? He got on with it and led the charge to glory.

As of right now your kick starter has £0. This suggests to potential investors that noone, not even the friends or relatives of the people involved, or the people involved themselves regard it worth of support.

As a self promotion I would put £10 of your own money in the kickstarter pot. I know you're going to say 'we invested our own time and effort, and we have invested financially already to the tune of x pounds', but as a potential investor, it just seems a bit off.

Also, you may want to correct the minor typo ""Risk's"" should not have a possessive apostrophe.

I'd try and add another kickstarter offer at the 5 or 10 level. I think you're much more likely to get smaller donations. Think about how Louis CK managed to be successful with his internet venture.

It's the kind of cleaning Barca recieved ( and they lost their biggest icon then) before they emerged as one of the greatest sides of all time. 


On a side note, just wanted your thoughts, do you think Benitez is doing a good job? Honestly speaking, I think he's really been doing some phenomenal work in the short period of time since he's taken over (although QPR and West Ham weren't the finest matches for viewing). I wouldn't mind if Benitez stuck in the long term, I've always admired him (from afar) especially for his Valencia days.

Taken from the book's wiki page:


&gt; The United Kingdom branch of Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, stopped selling copies of the book after receiving legal letters from the Church of Scientology; booksellers Waterstone's and W H Smith also received the legal letter, and Borders Books may have also been ""warned off"" selling the book.....

&gt;Customers that had previously placed orders for The Complex with Amazon.co.uk were informed that the book is no longer available. Individuals that already ordered the book were sent an email from Amazon.co.uk that The Complex had been ""removed from sale for legal reasons"".
 By November 12, 2008 there was no trace of the book's listing on Amazon.co.uk, though the prior entry was visible in a cache of the page on Google. According to The Bookseller, Amazon.co.uk stated: ""Unfortunately, we have had to withdraw The Complex by John Duignan in the UK because we received a specific allegation that a passage in the book is defamatory regarding an individual named in the book. In circumstances such as these, UK law gives us no choice but to remove the title from our catalogue.""

So, a very similar situation to the one facing the release of Going Clear later this month.

true,shackleton1,eng-kent,Kent,"British nationalism isn't good. Like I said, I have a pretty low opinion of nationalism. British nationalists oppose the EU. Personally, I'm of the can't we all just get along school of thought. It's my belief that the world should be uniting. Rekindling a national divide is a step backwards into the 19th century, and that's the only reason that the UK is better than its constituent nations.

The delineation between ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism is quite fuzzy. In my opinion, the latter is usually a cover for the former. For example, American nationalists are technically civic nationalists because there is no American ethnicity. That doesn't make American exceptionalism any less repulsive. You know who else are civic nationalists? Conservatives.

The SNP will welcome outsiders right up until the point where the outsiders start to outnumber them, as is the case with the English. When they perceive that their Scottish society is threatened, they will oppose the perceived threat. Immigration isn't a problem at the moment because 1) they have bigger independence fish to fry and 2) they don't want to scare people by saying they are anti-immigration. It's a bit like the Conservatives saying they won't cut the NHS. But make no mistake, as other comments complaining about English immigration in this thread clearly demonstrate, when the time comes they will get down to the business of preserving what they see as a true Scottish society.

The only upside I can see is that splitting up the UK does have the potential to nip the problem in the blood. Then the problem might, conceivably, be resolved and we could all get along in a post uk way. It might be a sort of letting off of steam.

It is much of a muchness really. From where i am i feel closer to the action and like it like that, but the fact that i am so low down means I cannot see action on the opposite side of the pitch. I cant tell if some off sides are off side as the players are all in the way etc.

In my mind the second level is probably the best view, so both me and you lose out on some of the benefits each of us gets from where we are sat! If you see what i mean?

Where you are you can see more of the whole game and so should be able to see how the team is shaped and how the formation is working. Ample opportunity to see what players are doing off the ball. You will see when the ref and linesmen get it wrong as you get a 'top down' view of the match. You also get a fantastic view of the stands below you (opposite and to the side, you cannot see the people in 225 or 125 as your directly above them of course!) and that in itself is great especially for your first game. You will see how full the place is and will see how many blue scarves and wotnot are being waved around.

Atmosphere-wise I am not too pleased with it this season, but then it is going to be a full house and so there will be atmosphere around.

(additionally, there's no need to ask me questions like I'm your labrador my friend) From a government who got into office by declaring that ""we're in this together"", shouldn't they as a fundamental base of their philosophy be seen to be amongst and interacting with the voting public?

I've seen various arguments stating that a car is needed by senior ministers so that they can work in peace and quiet, but (and forgive me, I'm not really versed in London geography to the degree that I can estimate journey times with any degree of certainty) wouldn't it be far, *far* more economic and PR friendly to be reserving a seat along with the rest of the commuters and living like the people you happen to be serving in the name of?

Your highest hurdle will be to convince a company that you have adequate knowledge of British/EU hiring requirements.  I'd recommend you contact employment agencies to see what's out there and what qualifications are required of you.  If an employer wants you badly enough, they may pay for at least a part of your CIPD or other qualifications.  www.reed.co.uk and totaljobs might be a start.  Just browse the sites and see what jobs are listed in your field, then contact the listed recruitment agency to get the more specialised advice you need.

Also, London has a stable job market, but the cost of living is insane.  Be open to places outside London.  Plenty of companies have their HR function based outside the M25.

One quick question for you (and something I have been wondering for a little while): when Lamps / Terry / Cole leave the club, who do you see taking over as leaders in the team (with regards to captaincy especially)?

Losing the trio would hurt the talent we have in the side, but we can replace talent-- I'm not so sure looking at our side from the outside that we have any clear-cut leaders aside from those three, though. We have looked lost at times when our backs are against the wall and none of them are on the pitch.

I think the problem with the format at the moment is that it gets tiring after a while. I've only seen episode one, but the constant 'no-one is really his mate' joke can run its course quickly. Might be worth building a secondary character (eg George?) just to relieve some of the tension, or have a different reaction from peripheral characters. It'd be nice to know that Nathan did have some real friends. Equally, if the webseries was cut down to a 22min episode it might feel tighter.

I see that you have built on this in the trailer with introduction of the CEO (a little young perhaps for this role?), however it felt like that character needed a little more work somehow, although maybe that was just the trailer.

Potentially ignorant question: won't the C4 viewers want to see the backstory here? Picking up after a webseries seems odd, but then what do I know.

I travel a lot, 99% of the time by myself and it is comforting to have something that remains constant in your life no matter what else is temporary, for me that is Chelsea Football Club and the game itself in a broader sense. I've watched us play from all corners of the globe and been able to establish a rapport with strangers over nothing more complex than a common love of Blue. I'm not an emotional man truth be told, but I'll never forget being in tears hugging my mum as we watched 'that penalty' roll in.

I love when people crave knowledge, intellectual curiosity has got me far and it's a trait I look for and is common amongst my best friends. Here we have every conceivable opinion and it broadens one's horizons to be exposed to a different system of thought. Also, if I can do my bit to improve the understanding of Chelsea fans then it's only right I do so. It gives me a chance to escape the realities of high-pressure decisions, 20 hour days and countless nights alone in a soulless hotel room, as thousands of strangers come together to talk about a shared passion that doesn't discriminate between prince or pauper.

My other theory is that Sahin simply underestimated the physicality of the English game or that he just isn't adapting or enjoying life in England/Merseyside. 

I was extremely impressed with his performance in the FA Cup match against West Brom and he has also done well in the two Europa League matches he took part in against Young Boys and Anzhi. For these 3 matches he played in the DM role which is predominately occupied by Lucas when fit who is a much bigger character to the side and also technically on par with Sahin, although they do differ in many ways.

I guess time will tell us what is really going on but I highly doubt that there is an appearance cap in which we have to payout if he hits, either way he's being wasted and should definitely be getting more game time when Lucas needs to be rested or we come up against weaker opposition and can rotate.",0,1357579215,null,0,false,0,c7snz6q,t3_164gam,t1_c7snz6q,t3_164gam,null,1430885320,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

This is where I get off the train. I would say that players must try their best *within the rules* of the game to make their team win. Exploiting the rules line Hindes did is one thing, but *violating* them is another. As handballs (and diving) are explicitly against the rules, using these techniques is not ""exploiting the rules"" any more than robbing a bank is ""exploiting the law."" The proper word is not *exploiting*, it's *violating*.

Now, I agree that players *will* continue to do it, and I certainly wouldn't want to undo the AC Milan comeback, but at the same time, wouldn't it be nice if these guys were classy enough to put the rules and the spirit of the game ahead of their own interests? If that happened it would have perhaps undone some historic Liverpool victories, but imagine what other victories we might have had if other teams were also doing the same thing and all of the illegal/cheat goals scored against LFC were also discounted...

Now, obviously there's a bit of a Prisoner's Dilemma here, so that will likely never happen.

Players are always ""cheating"" - defenders put their arms up even when they know a player isn't offside, both teams claim the throw every time a ball goes out of play, and everyone has a handful of someone's shirt when a corner's being taken.

If you credit him with the disorganised defence, then he must take credit for the slick attacking trio as well. Also, FSW has changed nothing when it comes to the shape and structure of the defence.

In my opinion, the disorganised defence card was overplayed. There were crucial errors made by individual players that lead to negative results. And the dice was always loaded against RDM since he got the job. 

Basically he got shafted. I'm not blind, it was fairly obvious that RDM didn't have the capabilities of a top manager. The decision was probably right in the long run.

I am of the firm opinion that the lad should be given a run out in the team, alternating with Ba, starting next season. He has shown that he is top quality, in terms of minutes-per-goal, and I've watched every WBA match this season to track his progress. He is physical, holds up play, but also offers individual moments of brilliance (overhead kicks, sensational cross-field assists, etc). For me he's the real deal.

The animals that we call ""rabbits"" or ""bunnies"" used to be called ""coneys"" in English, but it was pronounced to rhyme with ""money""/""honey"". Because of the sound of the word, some people started to use it as a slang term for female genitalia. Others were uncomfortable with this association - just as some people will avoid the word ""pussy"" nowadays - and found ways to avoid it. One approach was to rhyme ""coney"" with ""stony"", which survives today as an alternative name for rabbits and in the place name ""Coney Island"". An even more successful approach was to refer to adult coneys by the name of their young: rabbits. A third approach was simply to change the sound at the front of the word, hence ""bunny"".  

Essentially, the word ""bunny"" exists because the word it derived from sounded a bit too much like ""cunt"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"Which is precisely my point; the figure is far more likely to be accurate *because* it's a part of a car pool. You're not even beginning to factor in the amount of staff and maintenence that will go *into* keeping said car running on a 24 hour basis should anyone in government need it. Your assertion is that it merely costs £300 because the engine is switched off, and no one's paying attention when the Minister for transport is using his car - quite the contrary is true, and shows an almost complete lack of understanding of how the civil service and many other branches of government think - in short, your view of how much is being spent is naive and simplistic to say the least. Your assumption is based upon the idea that these cars are the same cars you or I would take when we call a cab...This is not the case. Most cars within government have some form of security attached to them in varying gradients from bulletproof glass to bombproof casing and air filtration in the event of biowarfare...They are often watched vigilantly, and maintained to a high standard. Additionally, the chauffeur, while not security services, will more than likely be highly trained for civil service purposes, and employed solely *by* the civil service...In your rather limited mindset, do you *really* think things like this are so cheap?

Ergo, the principle of cost becomes (and pardon me, because we're talking about a potential £80k here) irrelevant, and becomes a question of misappropriation; the question of whether the minister should be using his position to demand a chauffeur driven car is questionable to say the least; there is no clear need for heightened security in the case of a minister such as the transport minister.",0,1357586838,null,0,1357587163,0,c7sqd96,t3_1641l5,t1_c7sqd96,t1_c7sq5nd,null,1430886465,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;You're not even beginning to factor in the amount of staff and maintenence that will go into keeping said car running on a 24 hour basis

The cost is £300 a day. That's not my figure. It's from the article that you appear not to have read. It's in the third paragraph: ""The cost of running the government car, which is largely used by Burns, is more than £300 a day.""

&gt;Your assertation is that it merely costs £300 because the engine is switched off, and no one's paying attention when the Minister for transport is using his car 

I didn't make any such assertion. I'm using the £300 *running costs* figure quoted from the article. You've either not read any of my comments or completely missed the point. 

&gt;our assumption is based upon the idea that these cars are the same cars you or I would take when we call a cab

It is. It's a bog-standard Toyota Avensis. 

&gt;...do you really think things like this are so cheap?

No. I think that it all costs £300 a day, as quoted in the article. 

&gt;the question of whether the minister should be using his position to demand a chauffeur driven car is questionable to say the least

However, it's not a question I've attempted, in any comment, to actually answer. 

Before you reply again, might I suggest a few things:

* Read the article. 
* Read my comments. 
* Understand the article and the comments.

To give you a brief run-down: The car costs £300 a day, whether it's used or not, by the minister or someone else. It doesn't matter. It costs £300 a day, which works out as £78,000 a year (which is where the rounded up £80k comes from). 

Just to remind you, that's not my figure, it's the figure quoted all over the article including the headline.

The point is... he doesn't use the car all day! He uses it for a finite time each day, the rest of the time it's available for other people to use. So, let's say he uses it for a quarter of a day, that means he's only costing the taxpayer £20k, not £80k.  

However, that's a very basic account of his use of the car. He doesn't use it for quarter of a day, he uses it for less.

Ok so let's say Drogba, Lampard, Terry stayed and they're on the bench for the 2013-2014 season. Disregard FFP for now, that's a 400k a week bench with players who would take longer to regain full fitness when they're injured. That 400K a week can also pay the wages of 6 Matas.

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"&gt;The way I see it is that if I needed an emergency service, I'd want people to do what they could to let an emergency vehicle through as fast as possible, so I try and do the same. Of course, as safe as possible.

Virtually everyone is the same as you on that one, and we really do appreciate it. Obviously you get some people who think a fire engine can sneak through an unrealistically small gap, but such is life. Fire engine drivers used to stop right in the bumper of rows of traffic, blue lights and wailers blaring, scaring people into moving, some still do. If they move into dangers way, it's the appliance drivers fault, and they get in trouble for it, and they are driving o their own licence, not a special one. We are supposed to stay back, knock off the audibles and approach the red light slowly, giving the traffic chance to see us and move if the choose to, but not making it appear as if they must move. Also forcing people to mount the curb caused problems. People would do it when they did not have to, then their lawyer would call the fire service and get new alloys for the 'curbing' that the fire service caused. It worked. A lot. Not so much anymore.

&gt;Out of interest, say you are approaching an island and the front row of cars goes onto the island to make space for you. In doing so, someone on the island hits one of these people (small accident not a massive one). Would you have to stop as you would if you were directly involved, or do you carry on to the emergency?

It's a difficult one. All the rules are based around us being 'involved' in the incident. It honestly probably depends what emergency we are on our way to. In all cases, I would like to think that we would stop and make sure they are okay, but head off at the earliest opportunity, leaving our contact details for possible witness statements, if they are needed.

If we are actually involved we are required to stop, and stay with the vehicles. That said if we were on the way to a persons trapped/reported incident, I would probably ignore that rule if the occupants of the other vehicles are okay. Only the officer in charge of the truck can make that call though, their job will rest on it. We might have to argue that decision in front of a judge and jury.

2.1 tackles &amp; 1.9 interceptions per game suggest otherwise. It's not as high as Allen &amp; Lucas, but it's higher than Gerrard, so if Gerrard can play the deeper role why can't Sahin?

His problem is that he's not been given an extended run in his preferred position. I wonder whether Rodgers brought him in thinking he could be used as a #10 - Rodgers has recently said we need one, we went for Gylfi Sigurdsson, and IMO the #10 spot is now the weakest area of our first XI unless Gerrard gets put there (which I don't think will happen under Rodgers).

If Rodgers brought him in wanting to use him as a #10, and has now realised that he's not effective enough there, then I can see why Sahin might be leaving; there's too much competition for the two deeper roles, and if Sahin's not in our first team then his wages are excessive.

true,jund23,logo,,"It is a bit weird but not too big a problem. There are other factors at play too, we have been in the stadium for ... what 9 years? A few years back there was a lot more singing where I was sat, and banter, I sit in 105. It was like people had finally gotten used to each other and were letting go more, joining in more. 

Two years ago the club set up the family stand, this I think affected the atmosphere quite a bit and will do for a while yet. People got all moved around, families up rooted and moved to the family stand for the cheaper kids tickets, meanwhile people moved in the opposite direction to get away from the kids. This happened all over the stadium and so weakened some social groups that had formed. 

I remember a fan behind me, about ten rows back. He had one of the loudest voices I had ever heard and would crack us all up with hilarious put downs of the opposition, or officials. He moved and it has been quieter since, he used to get people going, in good humour too.

Only when you get continuity of groups of fans, who grow familiar with each other over time, do you get people really going for it and singing and chanting. Especially us Brits, we are naturally shy and need the comfort of familiar faces before we will sing in public !

Plus we have a bigger crowd now, some of which have only recently started coming regularly. That affects the atmosphere.

I have noticed some people moan more and whinge more near me, but then that behaviour annoys me and so perhaps I notice it more than I should. It can be odd though, especially if we don't get going from the start, people shouting at Barry to do more or shouting Mancinis got it all wrong etc. It is some kind of weird human nature though, once you taste success you become used to it and your expectations grow. You demand more gratification, so it's only natural really.

It's mad, it's not that long ago we were struggling in the third tier, and now we are champions of england. People will still grumble!

 Us Brits do love a good moan though!

true,gavin19,,Belfast,"The problem I have is that often when people refer to 'dodgy areas', they don't mean shitty/deprived ones, what they really mean are either Protestant *or* Catholic areas. Like you mentioned Shankill/Sandy Row (west and south respectively by the way).

A lot of this is perception. People are often paranoid about other places because their own bigotry makes them think they are especially at risk. Whenever someone says to me, I wouldn't go to x/y/z, that's a flag to me.

Just today I had someone mention that they felt uncomfortable walking down a certain street in Belfast and they thought they were being stared at when they did so. This didn't make any sense to me until I realised that they connected that place with the 'enemy' and that they had this twisted perception that they 'knew' somehow.

I walk from Protest &gt; Catholic &gt; Protestant &gt; Catholic areas every day. The only time I feel aware is crossing from C &gt; P, or vice versa, in the event that someone/people might see me coming from a particular area and take 'offence'. I don't feel any more at risk in either place, nor should anyone else.

&gt; especially at night

I think this pretty much goes for anywhere, any country.

There's also stuff like stand up comedy shows you can get food at in Nottingham. Glee club (no nowt to do with the bollocks show), jongleurs, just the tonic all do good quality stand up (my favourite being the first one).

I agree the Trip is fab but the royal children has got bollocks in recent years. The salutation is still alright for ales and what not. Also worth checking out is the hand and heart on derby road. seriously great ""British"" food with some fab local ales and the ""is it legal, maybe not actually but no-one is noticing are they"" smoking area up top.
walkabout YES early doors but post 7pm on the weekend is chavsville. the approach opposite is slightly less dire and shows sport. 

totally agree with Mansfield road, a grand experience top-to-bottom, starting at the peacock and maybe finishing at the Grosvenor.

the bowling alley is good fun and you can buy booze there.

hotel wise the premier inn on goldsmith street tends to be cheap in july-times past cos all the students have pissed off home and its near trent uni which is near town.

another vague idea if you've a lot of time is doing a tram pub crawl, specially again if you like your ales.
if you fancy a scutty time that's vaguely alternative go for rock shitty on a Saturday night, if you don't pull then you're a chav or a mutant. 

Cornerhouse is good but pricey well worth a visit actually, make sure you do for at least one drink is saltwater, its a great view of the skyline and in summer they do a great outdoor thing with palmtrees and shit. only drawback is its pricey. slug and lettuce and revolution downstairs are alright as well but be prepared for a ludicrously severe dress code on the latter. 

good outdoor drinking places in the summer are the trip, the castle (just up from the trip) and the waterfront (although be prepared for mornic chavism and shrieking sluts if you choose friday or saturdays also do NOT eat in via fossa unless you want jizz in your cheap 4oz burger).

If you want more scutty then by all means do baa bar (although it does sometimes close when the students piss off) and cucamaras. Just don't blame me if you get stabbed.

think thats it.

Best things: Food!  You can find good food from practically every corner of the earth for every budget.  There's everything from £2-3 snacks to full Michelin starred restaurants. Also, from my experience, the city is a fairly safe place to be. I've not encountered many problems in my 29 years here.

Bad things: Nightlife..lacks the integration of other cities.  There's plenty of options, but all segregated into different places over the city centre.  E.g. Broad St, Digbeth, The Arcadian, Hurst St.  

Also public transport is just baaad.  Buses are frequently late, dirty and expensive.  (Correct change only!)  and local trains, especially the cross city line also have issues with punctuality and reliability.

I don't

No.

No. And now you're starting to sound a little bit mental.

Yes...not really. It's another no.

&gt;How about history?

I think it's often interesting.

No. And now you're starting to sound fully mental.

* ""France In Denial"": About your politians refusing to take the economic actions needed. http://www.economist.com/node/21551478

* ""What France Needs"": Industrial Union problems in France are similar to those Britain faced in the 1970's, which Margret Thatcher saw too in quite a brutal manner. http://www.economist.com/node/8080753

* ""France Faces the Future"": The country's politicians need to level with the French people on the need to embrace change. http://www.economist.com/node/6744226

&gt;she could still technically have people killed

Since the magna carta, we have attempted to hold the monarch to the rule of law (to varying degrees of success). Capital punishment is illegal under the European Convention and the Treaty of Lisbon - so no, lizzie cant have people killed.

&gt;throw the govt out

The power of the monarch to disband the government was removed in 2011 under the [fixed term parliaments act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011). 

&gt;I'm not aware of anything out of the ordinary that she's ever done. (Diana aside of course :))

The problem with diana is that the queens reaction was completely in line with royal protocol and convention - its just that protocol was out of step with the (presumed) feeling of the nation

The exercises of royal prerogative (the queens power) when not done on the advice of the prime minister would spark a constitutional crisis - the queen has never done this. 

There is however one incident in which the queen used her power in an unexpected way. The queen has the power to appoint a government. By convention she gives this power to the MP who can command parliament, inviting him/her to become the Prime Minister. For practical reasons this is the leader of the largest party.

Except that the conservative party didn't have much of a leadership selection  procedure, they assumed that the monarch would select the de-facto leader to become PM, they would then be rubber-stamped as leader of the party.

In 1957 after the PM resigned the queen had to choose a new PM. On the advice of Churchill and others, she appointed [Harold Macmillan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan#Prime_Minister_.281957.E2.80.931963.29). Most observers were expecting her to pick Rab Butler. In 1965 the Tories formalised their leadership selection procedure, taking the decision away from the queen.

For an example of what happens when a sitting monarch uses their power in opposition to parliaments wishes - see the [glorious revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution) ",0,1357598284,null,0,1357598561,0,c7su8ur,t3_16565b,t1_c7su8ur,t3_16565b,null,1430888275,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,thornbrook,present,Frank Lampard,"No offence to your buddies from the board/Executive club, but this thread has pretty much confirmed for me that we have the wrong kind of people in charge - I've completely lost faith in them over the past 3-4 years in particular.

The hypocrisy of talking about making decisions like these based on ""money being better spent elsewhere"" is downright laughable given our recent spending history.

The board has continuously made themselves look like boobs, particularly after the firing of Ancelotti.

The fact you mention in this thread that Ray Wilkins' departure was almost certainly motivated due to an affair with a board members wife - is pretty damning evidence that our board is more than capable of making decisions based on personal spite, rather that business sense or the clubs best interest.

I don't think I'm wrong about that.

I have no doubt that behind the scenes, these players (especially Cole), aren't as squeaky clean as they portray in public - and would no doubt have dirty hands when it comes to their contract negotiations - its the nature of the beast. I don't think it makes it ""OK"" that 'everyone else does it', but its certainly something most clubs these days would already have experience with.

The value of players like Lampard, Cole, Terry, etc. goes far beyond their contribution on the pitch.

They are the kind of players who 5-10 years down the track, starlets from England, Brazil, Spain, etc. should be signing for our club saying ""I grew up watching John Terry, he spent his whole career here, left an amazing legacy - he is the reason I've always wanted to play for Chelsea"" etc.

We need to keep players like them, as long as their contributions are to standard - because of the value they add to the culture/history/aura of the club. Not to mention the mentoring/leadership aspect they bring for younger/newer players.

Noone except heartless mercenaries will want to play for us in 5-10 years if our current board members remain, and continue making AWFUL decisions like they have been for years.",0,1357599230,null,0,1357599763,0,c7suk64,t3_1649ur,t1_c7suk64,t3_1649ur,null,1430888434,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"No offence taken, many decisions have been rightly derided, the departure of Ancelotti probably being the most contentious. Our recent spending history is a complex issue, on one hand you have the Roman indulgence; Torres, on the other you have great prospects who are on reasonable wages and have a strong resale value; Mata, Hazard, Oscar, Lukaku, Moses to name a few. Not to say we want to be a selling club, but it's nice to have players who aren't perpetually depreciating assets. Lampard has been discussed ad nauseum, nobody is privy to the contract talks but he has angered people at the club over the years and that may cost him, assuming a workable contract was ever realistic. Ashley Cole clearly has his issues but I believe this departure is out of our hands, if the player really wants to leave we can't force him to stay. 

John Terry is different again, while he continues to be the leader on the pitch and greatly improves the team, he just has too much baggage. The various scandals have really damaged the club's reputation, the club to their credit stuck by their man more than anybody thought they would. The heartless decision making you're talking about would have seen him dealt with much more severely elsewhere, but it has taken it's toll on his standing. As far as people are concerned, our captain is a racist who sleeps around with team-mates partners. People who care will know better but it's obvious most of the general football community will always believe the worst about him

It's the nature of the beast, if I was to be honest I would say that I believe the trophies we've won and the rise in club stature will attract more starlets than the individual contributions of some of our legends. Obviously there are certain exceptions, Didier has made us a giant in Africa and it wouldn't surprise me if we reap the benefits of that in a few years time, Lukaku chose Chelsea mainly because of Didier though he was also a Chelsea fan because of our cosmopolitan late 90s team, to add credence to both of our points of view

I don't doubt that if Lampard wanted to retire at the end of the season then some effort would have been made to keep him on in a coaching role, same with Didier. They want to continue playing though and perhaps what they want is something we can't offer. Terry has 18 months left and we shall see what happens towards the end of his deal.

true,Gettingworst,num26,,"I'm not sure many people get AVB's play style. He wants to play 4-3-3 with a high defensive line. It's true that he had to compromise and use the 4-4-2 system because we missing that deep lying playmaker in midfield. 

AVB's prefered way of the midfield is a defensive midfield, a deep lying playmaker and a box to box midfield. Obviously, Sandro will fill the defensive role with Moutinho as the playmaker and have Dembele going box to box. Because we're lacking that playmaker in the middle, we're having to use Dembele in that role right now and let's be honest, while Dembele is great at the short passing game, he lacks that vision of a true deep lying midfield and that's why we haven't had much luck early in the season when we were playing 4-3-3. 
As the 3 up front, Defoe will be the striker through the middle with Bale and Lennon as wide support strikers. One of them will revert to cutting inside while the other stay wide depends on where the play area is. Our full backs will help support the wide forwards or squeeze the midfield when we get overrun with the 3 midfield tucking in and give room for the full backs to push forward and be more expansive in attack. We already have most of the players at the club to play AVB's preferred style, just missing that link in the middle and Moutinho is the perfect guy for that. 

I really hope we can get Moutinho at Spurs, if not this window then maybe next season and really watch how AVB play his preferred 4-3-3.

true,vinnyalghul,null,null,"I had a thought about this the other day while watching this episode, for some reason it's those last lines about asking The Doctor to visit a young Amy that made me think something wasn't all quite right with the way they went out. 

I understand that now that The Doctor read it in the book it's supposedly set, and that whole time period is all wibbly wobbly and anti-Tardis but still...

We all know how The Doctor tells young Amy the stories in her sleep so that she'll remember The Doctor and bring him back after the whole Pandorica thing happens, but what's stopping him from doing that again with, this time, The Doctor bringing Amy back?

Young Amy won't have read her future yet, so it won't be set in stone, but will subconsciously know to be able to hand what happens with her and Rory in the future, just like she was able to subconsciously remember The Doctor. Her future won't be set in stone since she doesn't know about it yet, so she'll have the power to change it without even thinking twice about it. To make up for the loss of losing Amy, The Doctor goes back and teaches Amy to rectify what happened without her even knowing. The way her and Rory went out felt too distant and rushed, I can't help but think there's something bigger at work here. 

So obviously there may be holes to this, but I thought there was something not quite right with how they went out.

As with the East Stand development, we were promised by Ken Bates that these businesses would add to our income streams and make the club more sustainable, yet in five years since administration it appears that all they are doing is racking up additional costs and taking investment away from the field of play. We would be keen to understand when these businesses will start to repay their past debts and start contributing to the football club.

Conclusion

Despite certain questionable management decisions by Ken Bates and Shaun Harvey during the last five years we still feel that, beneath it all, GFH Capital have inherited a club that can be turned around into a successful and sustainably profitable one, with investment in the team and cost cutting in the right areas. There are significant challenges facing the new ownership in the immediate future and big decisions will need to be made regarding the viability of some of these historic investment decisions. GFH Capital will also need to be prepared to invest cash in the short term into areas that have been badly neglected, not least the playing squad. The legacy of spending £17.7m on building projects that have yet to bring any benefit, and have been a drain on the club’s playing resources, will not be easy to shake off.

The advice of Rob Wilson after the last accounts still rings true: the club need to encourage the loyal fan base back to Elland Road by investing in the team and engaging with the fans, which in turn will help them to sell more tickets, attract better sponsorship, and hopefully get us back to a place in the Premier League.

true,DaveMcElfatrick,,Coleraine,"I think the problem with a lot of Loyalists is that they readily align themselves with Protestantism, and vice versa- names like the ""Bally*****(whatever) Protestant Boys"", various Protestant fraternities such as the Order, whatever. Protestants tend to be more vocal in aligning their religion of birth to their political beliefs. Peter Robinson speaks of speaking on behalf of ""the Protestant people"", stuff like that. It's ingrained in the community. You don't see many Republican fraternities define themselves as the ""Catholic Boys"", or whatever. Even the GAA has it's cup named after a Protestant. 

I feel many Protestants in Northern Ireland need to learn to define themselves personally, rather than readily subscribe to an age-old ideology laid out for them. More Catholics in the north are now quite happy to describe themselves as Northern Irish, for example, rather than strictly Irish. Loyalists are, as a whole, more stubborn, harking back to hundreds of years for their philosophy. Conveniently, they skip over large chunks of history that define them as an Irish people, too; the unity of many Protestants against the crown in the 1798 uprising, the Ascendency's involvement in keeping the Irish language alive in the 1800s, etc. Carson, the loyalist hero, was a proud Irishman. He loved his country, despaired at partition and spoke Irish. If only more Protestants broke convention and actually embraced their Irishness, too- we'd be in a much more pleasant Northern Ireland.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; For most people, swearing at a police officer is enough to get you an appearance before a magistrate.

There's a difference between calling someone a fucking asshole (cunt, pig whatever) and using the word *fucking* as an adjective / for empahsis. *I'm having a fucking bad day, alright?*

One of these uses is directed, the other is merely an expression of stress. 

I've had some shitty experiences with cops, but I think that most would just overlook *""I thought you lot were supposed to be fucking helping us""* because by that stage the perpetrator is walking away from the confrontation and the situation is diffusing itself.

Admittedly I'm white and well-spoken, but I disagree that ""swearing at a police officer is enough to get you an appearance before a magistrate"". In fact, it's more likely to get you an £80 fixed penalty fine with no judicial oversight, but I'm doubtful of that, too, in the case of this ""fucking helping us"" wording. 

I hate to be defending cops as much as I hate defending a tory. But in this case we're better off looking at *what actually happened*, which is that the police officers present appear to have lied and falsified their reports - perjury, in essence. I can tell you, from experience, that this is quite common, and IMO it is much more serious.

Er, a protestant IRA man? Is that the best you can do? Didn't help his churchmen much in his home village...

Why is that even an issue? It's self-evident, in the same way the GAA get blessed by parish priests. They are intertwined. You obviously have a problem with one or the other and attempt to cheapen both. Poor effort son.

&gt;Protestants tend to be more vocal in aligning their religion of birth to their political beliefs.

Utterly subjective. We had an (ex?)SDLP man say he preferred the DUP's theories not so long ago because they were more pro-Catholic. See what you want to see. Pick out who you want to. You're only showing your own bias.

&gt;Many Protestants in Northern Ireland need to learn to define themselves personally, rather than readily subscribe to an age-old ideology laid out for them.

&gt;Many Catholics in the north are now quite happy to describe themselves as Northern Irish, for example, rather than strictly Irish. I feel as a whole, they are more progressive.

Prods=bad, Catholics=good. No proof, no facts, no evidence. Just conjecture; hot air. This is real base stuff. A normal subreddit would downvote it to where it belongs, but the nat-whoring on here won't stand for it.

Show me a Catholic loyalist hero. Not to prove any point I'm making, I'm simply asking objectively.

&gt;Why is that even an issue? It's self-evident, in the same way the GAA get blessed by parish priests. They are intertwined. You obviously have a problem with one or the other and attempt to cheapen both. Poor effort son.

I didn't say I thought the GAA was an absolute blessing, either. You're giving me a straw-man argument here.

&gt;Utterly subjective. We had an (ex?)SDLP man say he preferred the DUP's theories not so long ago because they were more pro-Catholic. See what you want to see. Pick out who you want to. You're only showing your own bias.

 A rather meek example, in contrast to say, [this.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F9CM-qcNX8M/T0P9jRaYc_I/AAAAAAAAA4M/AHQ0YyW8ClU/s1600/paisley1969.gif) Might I refer to [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Northern-Protestants-Unsettled-Susan-McKay/dp/0856407712) for more of an insight to what I'm talking about. Reading it only solidified what I was already aware of from being raised in a staunchly loyalist town.

&gt;Prods=bad, Catholics=good. No proof, no facts, no evidence. Just conjecture; hot air. This is real base stuff. A normal subreddit would downvote it to where it belongs, but the nat-whoring on here won't stand for it.

You mentioned GAA first, I pointed out they, as the largest of the Irish nationalist cultural organisations, have a heavy Catholic emphasis. So your assertion that loyalism asserts some kind of uncommon emphasis on religion is factually incorrect. It's equivalent. You're blinkered.

The census where a lot of Roman Catholics emphasised they were not separatist? That was hardly news, it's a long term trend and it logically flows that if they are happy with the status quo then they are content to label themselves Northern Irish. Equivalent with large numbers of Protestants in the Republic. A large proportion of Northern Irish protestants are also comfortable to label themselves Northern Irish. Long may both trends continue.

true,OKsoIneedAnAccount,lfc12,,"I think the most important thing, that seems to have passed most, if not all journalists by, is that the referee actually saw the handball and deemed it to be allowed according to the rules. 

From FIFA's Rules of the game:
&gt;Handling the ball involves a deliberate act of a player making contact with the ball with his hand or arm. The referee must take the following into consideration:
&gt;
&gt;• the movement of the hand towards the ball (not the ball towards the hand)
&gt;
&gt;• the distance between the opponent and the ball (unexpected ball)
&gt;
&gt;• **the position of the hand does not necessarily mean that there is an infringement**

So in other words, the rules of the game were applied to the situation by the referee, and the goal was allowed. One might add that the referee was very consistent in these type of events, there were 2 or 3 penalty shouts from Mansfield as well that were clear cases of ""ball moving towards then hand"". This of course only makes Mansfield feel more robbed, but at the end of the day the referee was consistent.

This means, that even if Suarez had gone to the referee and said ""Sir, it was a handball"", the referee would very likely still let the goal stand. 

While I personally think that Suarez' goal should be disallowed, if ALL referees interpreted the rules this way we would not have to see situations like the penalty that was awarded following Joe Allen's handball at Upton Park.

Honestly, winning is everything in football. World Cup/Euro games always turn ugly and show this very well. When Portugal held Spain to extra time in the Euro 2012 Semi's (or Quarter's, can't quite remember), everyone was going down during extra time at *any sort of contact*, or even no contact at all, especially if their team didn't have possession/the opposition has a promising attack.The referee can't do anything about it, he has to stop the play if a player is down for a while. And he can't card anyone either, because it's really difficult to tell if he really got hit or not.

Netherlands against Spain in the WC2010 was not a pleasant match either, De Jong planted his foot right into Xabi and got only a yellow for it. Should he have gone to the referee and said 'Please send me off, it should have been a red. It's in the rules that that's a clear red card.'? Of course not. People can talk about class and all that, but all that 'class' comes in when player's are off the pitch. On the pitch, you want to win, no matter through what means. No team will accept a ""classy loss"" over a controversial win.

David Moyes can 'show class' by saying how Suarez's disallowed goal should have been a goal, but there's no way he's not smiling on the inside, happy that he took something away from the game.

&gt;You mentioned GAA first, I pointed out they, as the largest of the Irish nationalist cultural organisations, have a heavy Catholic emphasis. So your assertion that loyalism asserts some kind of uncommon emphasis on religion is factually incorrect. It's equivalent. You're blinkered.

I do think that more Protestants should indulge in the GAA. I feel many are just not interested, or may be put off by their former exclusion of the security forces. I do know a good few Protestants play these days though, including police members.

I see no real difference. Take a look at any mural in any loyalist estate while you're at it.

Head over to the Mortgage and debt-free forums at moneysavingexpert. A default will have a significant impact on your ability to get a mortgage. There are a lot of members that are brokers over there and will give you much better advice. You cant simply ""cancel out"" something like a default. With 4 years it'll ""look better"" than if it happened within the last 12 months but so long as it is on your file it will cause you problems getting a mortgage. I'd bet the advice you'll receive is to find an independent mortgage broker in 4 years time and hand them copies of your credit file. They'll be able to tell you right away who will flat out refuse you with a default on your file so you don't waste your time.

1. **Stevan Jovetic** Fiorentina  
    Fiorentina just signed Rossi, which could mean Jovetic might come at a cheaper price, but only later on. He is good, and I believe could do well in the EPL given time. At age 23, he has room to improve. Verdict: Unlikely, what with Rossi's injury record.
2. **Leandro Damiao** Internacional  
    Everyone knows about this by now, most are excited by the prospect, but I'm still on the fence, teetering toward him. Nevertheless, I'm interested to see Damiao have a go in the EPL. [HP18 has swayed my opinion a little on the player.](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1624r8/tottenham_hotspur_to_bid_15m_for_leandro_damiao/c7s5y90?context=3) Strangely enough with information I was aware of, go figure. My only gripe is the price. Verdict: Most likely---according to the press---if we are to sign a striker, it will be him.
3. **Ricky van Wolfswinkel** Sporting CP  
    The name, wow, love it. Like Jovetic, Ricky is 23, and a very accurate finisher, although he doesn't score that many if you look at his stats. Verdict: Unlikely, considering how poorly Sporting are doing that they'll wish to lose him.
4. **David Villa** Barcelona  
    There is a possibility, and I think it is higher than getting Llorente. Considering his price tag (cheap for a player like him), his age (the Levy resale value), and his injury record, I doubt it. It would be great to unleash his finishing ability on the league, dressed in lillywhite, though. Verdict: Could happen as a stop-gap measure, but why would he choose us? We can't offer stupid wages, nor UCL this season.
5. **Seydou Doumbia** CSKA Moscow  
    Not a prolific striker, yet he does possess great ball control, speed, and has good awareness.
6. **Dame N'Doye** FC Lokomotiv Moscow  
    Only just signed in the summer, so I doubt it. Stranger transfers have happened, see: Fryers. According to Senegalese fans, he is considered better---in terms of overall potential skill and talent----than both Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse. Take that how you will.
7. **Llorente** Athletic Bilbao  
    Rumors abound that he is on his way to Juventus, but there is not enough concrete information on it (probably delusion on my part). Would love to have him, however it is highly unlikly. High wages, lack of match fitness, and I think he might actually want to go to Juve.
8. **Wilfried Bony** Vitesse  
    I don't rate this guy, although I also have only seen him play once. He is having a stellar year at Vitesse scoring 20 goals in 20 games, plus three assists. I doubt they'd be willing to sell him, unless the buyer is willing to pay inflated prices, considering his current season.

So, finally, I want Jovetic, but will be more than happy with Damiao. The most important point is that we need a striker this window, or else we might have a few problem if Defoe and Ade (after ACN) either struggles for form or gets injured. I hate to even think what would happen if they both went down.",0,1357636246,null,0,false,0,c7t53pt,t3_165sks,t1_c7t53pt,t1_c7t1j95,null,1430893532,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

There's some easy ways to save pubs.  Stop the ridiculous 2% above inflation tax rises for one.

It is understood that the five-year deal signed by the Belgian in 2011 allows him to leave Goodison Park if Everton receive a bid of £22 million or more from a Champions League club. Chelsea were able to take advantage of such a buyout clause in Demba Ba’s contract with Newcastle United to sign the Senegal striker last week and will use similar tactics in an attempt to recruit Fellaini.

So there is no evidence of specific health hazards, BUT we *think* that users of cannabis are time wasters who can't be bothered with work.

Lettering by hand would look better but only if done well, believe me I've seen some AWFUL examples of both. Essentially they just need to give their speech bubbles some attention, fonted ones can look just fine if composed correctly. The main issues here are the sizing/placement and the line quality. 

OP's friend should do a quick google search as there are plenty of good tutorials out there to get you started. 

General comments to OP's friend too. Very good work, if you're looking to improve I'd look at getting your proportions better (anatomy is something we all need to brush up on) and looking a bit more into perspective. Also try your hand at some colouring tutorials, it's amazing how much more depth you can get out of a piece if coloured really well.

That and line quality. I'm guessing these were inked by hand and scanned?

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; His problem is he's the 4th or 5th best midfielder on the squad.

Agree to disagree.

&gt; He is nearly immobile. He needs to be surrounded with high energy, pacey players..which we really don't have at the moment.

I'd say calling him ""immobile"" is harsh - IMO he's more mobile than Alonso. And we have 3 high energy, pacey players - Lucas, Allen and Henderson all cover a lot of ground.

&gt; He's a lazy defender, and doesn't hustle like we need him to. He's similar to a Pirlo/Xavi player. Great at controlling a match.

Again, I don't think he's lazy at all; Gerrard's been much lazier at times this season. Also, Xavi's not lazy - none of the Barca players are.

&gt; His loss of possession rate is astounding, yet his minutes per tackle rate is less than Lucas, Allen and Gerrard.

It's not great, but IMO that's a combination of two things: 

1. being played out of position as an attacking midfielder; he'd have a better pass completion rate playing deeper, where the players we're comparing him with have been playing.

2. Playing most/all of his appearances very early in the season, when everybody's pass completion (except Joe Allen coz he's Joe fuckin' Allen) was lower while people adjusted to the style of play.

The minutes per tackle rate is a good point, and I can see why that suggests he's lazy; I'd say it's more like Raul Meireles, where he only goes for tackles he has some confidence he can win. That doesn't mean he doesn't press - Meireles was box-to-box despite not tackling frequently, and Sahin gets a good number of interceptions.

&gt; I honestly believe roles switched after he was signed. Rodgers went into the season banking on Gerrard being the #10, but quickly realized he no longer has the legs for it. I think his ideal midfield was going to be Lucas, Allen/Sahin, Gerrard. Once he realized Gerrard's role needed to be deeper, he was faced with a massive dilemma.

Agree with you here - so based on that, despite all of my considerations to your points, it makes sense for Sahin to leave if he's not going to be a regular first XI starter - he'd be too expensive a backup option. It'll just be a shame, and a waste of a good player.

&gt; I disagree on our #10 status. I actually think it's the only position where we have a truly world class player - Suarez. 

Assuming he plays there (though I want him there). We'll have to wait and see how Rodgers plays it. Equally, we really won't know until the end of the next window, because Rodgers may play Suarez as a #10 for the rest of this season and then go buy a #10 in the summer anyway and put Suarez on the flanks.

We have won 4 league titles and 2 F.A. cups (an annual English tournament consisting of the 4 top leagues in England.) and we have been playing in the top flight of English football for a record 109 seasons. We were probably at our best in the mid 1980's when we won the league twice, won the F.A. Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup.

Our big rivals are Liverpool, probably one of the biggest rivalries in English football, it's a great experience to watch the Merseyside Derby.

It seems loyalists in that context are feeling like the DUP is increasingly not representing them, with the issue of the flag becoming a symbol for that. We are all seeing a move to more radical parties (UKIP as an example) and in Northern Ireland that inherently comes along with the question of being unionist or republican and in this case we are seeing an expression of loyalist discontent with the unionist parties. I think we will increasingly see that dived become more pronounced and the terms less interchangeable than they have been over the next few years.

Well, we do agree to an extent - I'm not saying any of the knock-on effects you describe won't happen, but when a child's weight goes down to 3 stone, and SS don't notice (or consider this an alarm), then they're failing. *Why* they're failing becomes a seperate issue (funding, etc.) - but then we're still back to the 'gov. fined me for speeding, therefore my kids have no shoes' blame-game. And like it or not, fines are the quickest way to ensure people comply (speed cameras, for example, have done far more than any number of expensive celebrity-starring 'don't speed' TV ads, just as on-the-spot fines for seat-belt wearing did a lot more than Saville's 'clunk-click').

Nobody, for example, worries about finances when things go badly and they insist on a 'full public enquiry' that they'll never pay for themselves, despite all the costs you list being just as relevant.

What we *don't* agree on is your the suggestion that any time a baby dies due to wrongly-administered drugs (etc.), then the associated family demanding compensation is purely down to get-rich-quick motives, which is both laughable and insulting.

The demonisation of the working class is partly to blame, but also the dilution of culture and the lowering of Britain's status in the world to the point where you are considered either a crypto-racist or an ignoramus for showing any patriotic feeling. Just look at us - swimming in downvotes for adding our opinions to the discussion, it's like we're just on the outside and the only opinions that are accepted here are ones that essentially say 'I don't care about the flag, because I'm intellectually above such things so I can't comprehend them, only chavs care about these things, lol'. It's as if being a patriot requires objective justification - if we aren't the most powerful country in the world or we aren't world leaders in something then it's pointless to be patriotic.

true,loveandmoney,1986,,"Thanks for an interesting read. I've got a few questions I'd love to hear your take on.

Firstly, your portrayal of Lampard as a greedy mercenary goes against almost every other piece of evidence. Even at a club such as ours which attracts much ire from other supporters and the media, Lampard is seen as a decent bloke. I've never heard him say anything to make me doubt his integrity. The business with him and Inter Milan was just after he lost his mum and was unsure whether he wanted to stay in London amid all that entailed. I accept that the upshot was a healthy new contract, but that's how football now works, the best players get the best contracts from those willing to stump up the money and they have agents to make that happen.

Yes Lampard was part of the resistance to AVB's ways but he knew what was best for the club and that was certainly not the managerial techniques of AVB. You could argue that without Lampard, we would have continued to ostracize our best players, playing naively and would never have won the champions league, in that sense, he did as much as anyone to cement that prize.

My question is whether to your knowledge it is all about the money, or do Chelsea want Lampard out full stop, no one year contract, no salary cut? 

And while I have your ear I feel obliged to ask about Di Matteo. Was his sacking purely results based? It seemed to me that Benitez had been in the picture for a while and the fact he replaced RDM so quickly only adds to my suspicion that Benitez and his agent had been moving towards this end for a long time. Did Roman truly just never believe RDM was a capable manager? And did he truly not know or care about the fans feelings on the matter?

People should be rewarded and encouraged to be good parents. After all, todays children are tomorrows tax payers. And you definitely want middle class people to be incentivised to have kids, because their children will probably end up paying more tax than poorer kids. Especially while there are a bunch of rich boys running things who only want wealth redistributed ""upwards"".   

Those rich enough already should be opting out if they feel they have enough. Not spending money they don't need on Holidays like the millionaire Boris Johnson. I know it is an old saw, but there are more unclaimed benefits than there are fraudulent claims. And tax avoidance and evasion cost way more than the total benefit bill. Despite what this government and our media tell us .

The majority of the benefit bill is, by my understanding, pensions anyway, so cutting the rest is just salami slicing.   

Until we regard parenting as a serious occupation and not just something that happens when you aren't at work, kids, and our perception of them, will continue to be rubbish.

He also said that the big guys quickly put the little guys out of business through vicious tendering techniques. Basically they drive the price so low that only the biggest can survive, then they mop up the remaining business. A lot of work is done for free, in exchange for providing other work that pays well. e.g. the bathroom is free as long as they can do the heating, because heating products have higher margins.

My advice, from what I've heard, is to be an emergency ONLY plumber. Be the one who people call when the shit hits the fan, floor, wall, sink, wherever. Don't bother taking calls for anything less, pass the business on to other plumbers - this will help you form a network. 

You charge high, but you do the work that no-one else wants to do - 24/7/365 *no matter what*. People in pain will pay whatever it takes to make the pain go away. Be there for them and you'll build a good word-of-mouth relationship with your customer base.

In Canada I earnt 50k which is considered a *graduate* salary. With 50k I could have 3k after tax at end of the month with 700 on all inc rent and the rest for food, savings and eating out. So let me repeat that's $2300 dollars left over after rent and my only expenses would be food. 

Earn 22k in the UK which amounts to 1300 after tax, 425 on rent, 100 council tax a month, £35 on gas and electric, however much the water. In short that's £710 pounds left yet the purchasing power (when in canada and the uk) is almost parity (when in canada you can buy what you could for the most part with 1 dollar) and the cost of living is awful.

true,custerc,null,null,"&gt;Hindes violated the rules. The rule states clearly that you are allowed a restart if you accidentally crashed. He intentionally crashed. That's not exploiting the rules, that's violating the rules. Plain and simple.

Then the British team should be disqualified and stripped of their gold medals. It's really not that complicated. 

&gt;I really don't know if you've watched Neville's take on diving. Here's one video if it, there's another floating around somewhere where he goes off in another minor rant.

Did watch it, find it to be a very uncompelling argument. ""Everyone is doing it"" is a terrible justification for doing *anything*, whether it's in a sport or just in life generally. And if diving is the only way to get the right call from the officials, that is a *reffing issue* that the league needs to address, not an excuse to break the rules whenever it seems potentially advantageous to do so. 

&gt;Honestly, winning is everything in football [...] people can talk about class and all that, but all that 'class' comes in when player's are off the pitch. On the pitch, you want to win, no matter through what means. No team will accept a ""classy loss"" over a controversial win.

But if players stopped cheating, every team's wins and losses would be roughly the same in the end. Liverpool has lost as many, if not more, matches as the result of cheating and dishonesty than they've won. So if we imagine a world in which the players didn't actively try to cheat, the wins and losses would even out similarly. The only real difference would be that cheating teams would win a bit less; would that be such a shame? (Maybe in an environment where cheating was not considered acceptable, they'd consider it inspiration to actually improve their form.)

I realize that seems unfathomable, but let's take a look at diving in professional hockey. I think this is a great example because diving is, if anything, *more* advantageous in hockey than it is in soccer, as it can draw a penalty that gives your team a one man advantage for 2-5 minutes (which, in a 5-on-5 game that only lasts 60 minutes, is huge). Yet hockey, even at the highest Olympic and professional levels, does *not* have a major problem with diving. Sure, it happens every now and then, but it's not frequent and certainly nowhere near the levels that it reaches in professional soccer. 

So, do professional hockey players value winning less? I doubt it. Their jobs are just as dependent on their performances as any other professional athlete. The reason they don't dive much, I think, is that it isn't considered ""part of the game"" the way it is now in soccer. When a hockey player dives, they are ridiculed. No one goes on TV to talk about about how ""any forward would have done it"" and ""everyone is just looking to give their team an advantage, it's part of the game.""

Interestingly, though, for a long time professional hockey DID have a problem with endemic fighting; also a rule violation. Why? I suspect in large part because that WAS widely considered to be ""part of the game,"" and there were pundits on TV talking about how fighting was OK even though it was against the rules because it's ""just a part of the game"" and ""everyone does it."" (Although this might be hard to buy, fighting was also considered a way to give your team an advantage in some situations, and plenty of players would swear by its effectiveness I'm sure).

Over the past decade or so, the NHL has been rebranding, made some rule and emphasis changes, and has been working to eliminate the culture of fighting being acceptable, with some success. Fighting isn't entirely gone, of course, but it's less common, and you hear it defended less as legitimate. Frankly, the sport is better off for it. I don't see *any* reason why something similar couldn't happen in professional soccer.

&gt;It would be nice if we had all the players in the world following the rule book closely, but rules are there to be exploited, violated, broken, whatever. As long as rules exist in this world, they will be exploited, violated.

Should the violators not be punished, though? Is it acceptable to do *anything* to gain an advantage, so long as you can get away with it? That is a terrible lesson for any sport to be teaching, and moreover, I find it hard to believe you would consider this acceptable if someone used this justification to cheat you out of money at cards (for example). Nor, I suspect, are many Liverpool fans talking about how ""rules are there to be exploited"" when we're on the *losing* side of an incident like this.

Rules are there to be **followed**. When you violate them to give yourself an advantage, that is **cheating**. The fact that it *is* considered widely acceptable does not mean that it *should be*.

(I'm not sure Suarez hit the ball with his hand on purpose, so I'm not saying what he did is necessarily cheating. But everything in that Neville video is cheating; he may shy away from using that term but I'm not sure why because violating the rules intentionally to gain an advantage is basically the textbook definition of the word cheating).",0,1357656125,null,0,1357656990,0,c7t7uhz,t3_162aup,t1_c7t7uhz,t1_c7t3kv5,null,1430894827,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

And no I'm not talking about the minority of Unionists/Teenagers who go out and riot. I'm talking about the position of the majority of unionists who favour peaceful protest and intelligent debate. The problem is less about the flag coming down and more to do with an increasing political correctness coming from Nationalist parties. The flag coming down was a spark in fuse that has been ready for the past few years. The view is, that why correct something that isn't offensive. There had been no riots, public disagreements or protests made by nationalists beforehand. And since it is ""just a flag"" as many people would say, then why get offended in the first place? And shortly after the flag came down, Sinn Fein made a move/suggestion to rename the Royal Victoria Hospital. Where does it stop?

Don't get me wrong, I vote Alliance and I think the flag coming down was good because I quite frankly don't want to see either Tricolour or Union Flag anywhere because I think it's just stupid. But Sinn Fein's being seen as the 'big cuddly, liberal, pro-equality teddy bear' really worries me.

If the image is already bigger than the required size, you can usually just crop it and shrink it. In most cases, the image will be too small. 

With this image, I used photoshop, but you can also use gimp. I expanded the canvas to the required size. I then just used the selection tools to copy/paste sections of the background, lining them up and getting everything to flow and not be staggered in any way. This was fine for the specific image because it's a playmat, and the extended borders look rather nice. 

I merged all my layers and then zoomed to 100%. At this point I cleaned up some of the worst artifacts. I did not vectorize, although that would have been ideal.

Now I can see that you're creative, fairly technical and able to function in an office / customer facing environment. All good selling points. You could even be a recruitment consultant if you were interested in sales / phone based work! 

A word to the wise - I wouldn't put your complete CV online in a place you're not trusting of. That might be overly paranoid of me but I wouldn't particularly want all my details / work history / home address / contact details there for all to see. Perhaps clear that contact info. off and then you could post it? 

Your next step is of course to market yourself out appropriately. This does depend on the kind of work you want or are applying to. There's no sense boasting of your creative abilities when it comes to applying to work in a bar - because they'll be more interested in someone who can pour a pint / deal with customers in a fast moving environment. 
 
On the flip side - if you were looking at an internship in video production, they won't be so interested in your office typing abilities and ability to pour a pint. You have to tailor your ""attack"" to suit the ""target"". 

I hope all this helps, give me a shout if you need help (I can see other folks have offered the same - it's quite heart warming really). Together hopefully we can help you find something.

&gt;    That it meet the needs of everyone

&gt;    That it be free at the point of delivery

&gt;    That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay

Based on that, it would seem that there is no moral perogative for richer people to opt out of NHS care- you shouldn't be disbarred from something which prides itself on equal access because you are better off any more than because you are less well off, it would be oxymoronic. I'm not sure such a mission statement existed for child benefit.

Besides, it's not like there is a parallel private alternative. I don't think there are any private A and E departments for example. 

As a personal aside, it gets my goat people talking about the 'burden' on the NHS. Not a critism of OP in particular, it's common parlance in the media. But honestly, people using NHS facilities are not a 'burden' all the time, they are using the facilities that are set up to treat them.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Mancini strikes me as the type of manager that will play people when he thinks that they are the best option.  The question is should he be introducing players sooner than when are entirely ready?  In comfortable cup matches I think the answer is yes, and he's shown something of a willingness to do that in the FA cup, but you can see from the squad on Saturday that he isn't prepared to risk losing out on silverware at the expense of giving youth  players a run out.

Mancini isn't under pressure from us, the fans, but the press have their own narrative and if they push it enough it tends to sway the more suggestible and become reality.  Mancini is trying to do what is best for the club one match at a time and it's difficult to fault that approach, and I think that's what he needs to do until the doubters are silenced.  
Fergie and Wenger can afford to put more trust in youth because their positions are largely beyond reproach.  Mancini isn't perceived in that way yet.

""They have been so understanding with my situation.
They understand that when I play I am playing on glass knees and glass ankles. It is a bit of a struggle.
They know I am at the end but they also know the predicament they are in. It is a major predicament.

Not only do you omit the boundary commission that co-opted counties into Northern Ireland that did not opt in of their own volition but you also the strategies of Stormont that deprived the nationalist community of voting rights. Unless of course by 'their own volition' you meant something other than the people of Northern Ireland.

The main parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic and the UK have no problem with those who Identify as British being British. We all agreed on that in 1998. We also agreed that is not the only identity to consider and that has been working quite nicely for the most part.

&gt;The yellow headlights were introduced in France in 1936. Ever the military strategists, yellow lights were required of vehicles in France so that they could be distinguished from white-lit German invaders. Of course, during the war, the yellow lights just made the shooting and blowing up easier for the Nazis.

&gt;The French kept the yellow headlights after the war. The official reason was that the yellow lights gave off less glare, which was sort of true but only when it was foggy.

I have concerns that his passing is not incisive enough to feed whoever we have playing at striker but I could see him being used in a very similar manner as Fellaini is at Everton: get the ball to him upfield as a target man and allow him to use his strength to lay the ball off or beat a man on the dribble.

When you start up running a business, there's lots of things you have to do that you don't have to even think about as an employee. Every single thing you have to do is essentially a gold-plated opportunity to get it totally wrong - and you'll do that dozens of times in your first 18-24 months.

Every thing you get wrong will cost you money. Some of those things are obvious - eg. making a mistake in a customer's home and having to fix it at your own expense, some are less obvious (eg. making a mistake in a customer's home, bodging the fix and the customer later realises what you've done and makes sure they recommend their friends go to anyone **but** you). It's unusual for a single mistake to sink a business - usually what happens is you run out of money and you run out of people prepared to extend you credit (ie. lend you money) first.

**Excerpt:**  
&gt;In 1936, the French for tactical reasons wanted a way to identify the registration nationality of vehicles at night. However, they did not want to reduce roadway safety, and wanted in fact to improve it if possible.
So, they figured to remove the blue from the output spectrum of their vehicles' front lamps.

I'm not quite sure what they meant by 'tactical' there, but that's the nearest they got to anything approaching a military explanation. 

I also found this old [Top Gear episode from 1990](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vArQgTQVYcw#t=44s), in which a Frenchman from the lighting industry discusses the topic and makes no mention of there being a military motive.

Summertown's one of the nicer (and most expensive) areas of Oxford.  Good bus routes in to town, and plenty of shops in Summertown itself.  I've been here for 6 years, and the rent has increased by around £50 each year.

I'm not sure where you're moving from (elsewhere in the UK, or from overseas), but there may be a few ""hidden"" expenses to watch out for: utility bills, council tax, etc.

I'd advise against using Finders Keepers.  They manage the property I rent, and are really terrible. It usually takes weeks of nagging to get anything fixed, and they are quite rude and inflexible with any requests. They clearly consider the land owner to be their only customer, and treat the tenant as just a mark to be fleeced. Expect £100+ fees for simply printing out the rental agreement, etc.

The only reason I haven't switched is that I really like the property I'm in (one perk is that the neighbouring flats are rarely all occupied, so the environment is very peaceful), and from what I've heard, most other letting agents are not much better than Finders Keepers.

The major power of the one ring is corruption. It corrupts its owner. Over time the corruption becomes so great that the creature becomes a slave to Sauron. The invisibility part of the ring is just a side effect. It's the bait in the trap. A useful thing to make people want to wear it and therefore fall prey to it. An episode could deal with the Doctor fighting the corruption or even dealing with a corrupted ring wraith version of his future self. 

Consider also that there is some argument that the Tardis itself is a powerful being that is alive. If that is so, the Tardis could be written as coveting the ring as well.  In that scenario you could have a Tardis that tried to stop the Doctor from leaving with the ring on, and certainly wouldn't let the doctor move to a place where it could be destroyed. 

The doctor's companions, of course, are useful in the same way Frodo is. Their lack of power is their power. 

Quite to the contrary of the comic, this could be an amazing thing to watch/read. Hell, they could even do it on Doctor Who itself with another corrupting artifact that followed the same bait and trap logic as the one ring. I'd love it.

**Edit:** I realised after I wrote that that I had slightly conflated the powers of the one ring with the powers of the rings it controls. The one ring corrupts and the one ring conspires to return to Sauron (although it sure does a poor job at that since it makes the user covet it above all other things as well) but it doesn't make the wearer subject to Sauron. That was an error on my part.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Has the author of that article even been to their local pub lately? The sheer number of them that are terrible is astounding.

Just taking my own local as an example: You walk the steps to a warm, welcoming glow. As you cross the threshold, a number of things strike you:

 - The carpet which sticks to your shoes.
 - The odd smell which you can't quite place.
 - The walls that are heavily stained with nicotine despite the fact that smoking was banned about five years ago.
 - The ceiling which has been painted a tasteful shade of faeces brown - probably in an attempt to cover the fact that it looked even worse - making the place feel dark and dingy.
 - The alcoholic propping up the bar and the chavs on the pool table are pretty much the only customers.
 - The light fittings that are falling off the walls, in some cases exposing bare wires.
 - The woodchip wallpaper that has adopted an unusual texture. You recognise this texture from your digs back when you were a student - the plaster behind the wallpaper has completely gone and the wallpaper is basically holding the wall together.

Gingerly, you walk across to the bar. Every eye (all nine of them) follows you as you cross the room. You can see three beer taps and a couple of hand pumps that have a thick layer of dust coating them. Mercifully, you recognise the beer taps, but there's something odd about the design that you can't quite figure out. You'll realise it in about twenty minutes or so - they're of a design you haven't seen in fifteen years or more.

You ask if they offer food. ""Yeah"", comes the sullen reply, ""but we stop serving at half seven"". You check your watch; it's 7:15. Deciding you'll just have to order quickly, you take a menu (which you're not offered), order a beer and a packet of crisps to keep you going, and retreat to a table to study the menu. The beer costs the same as four cans from the local supermarket, but there's not much you can do about that as it's already been poured.

A table's easy to find. Chairs that are all the same height, rather less so. This isn't an attempt to furnish the pub in a sort of shabby-chic style though - it's simply the result of chairs that have been used and abused for a couple of decades and when broken, replaced with whatever was available at the time.

The menu's been printed and laminated a long time ago, by the look of things. The laminate is covered in spots of grease, it's separating and the paper within is discoloured. The food itself is fairly standard pub fare - burgers, fish and chips and maybe a microwaved lasagne is on offer.

As you munch through your crisps (idly noting the best before date is some time in mid-2012), you decide to chance a burger. Checking your watch, you spot it's 7:25. Aware of the need to get a move on before the kitchen closes, you head to the bar to place your order.

The woman behind the bar is far too busy being chatted up by the alcoholic propping it up to notice you. After several minutes of failing to get her attention from a distance, you approach directly and ask if you can order food.

""Nah"", comes the reply, ""Kitchen's closed"". You check your watch; it's 7:29. There's clearly not much point in explaining that the kitchen wouldn't be closed if she paid attention to customers - and besides, by now you're starting to wonder if this is actually a blessing in disguise. You return to your table to finish your beer.

On finishing your beer, you head to the gents for a quick pee before leaving. Between the yellowing grout, the faint smell of urine and the tracing-paper loo roll you thought they'd stopped making years ago, this toilet clearly hasn't seen so much as a lick of paint since Thatcher was Prime Minister. You do your business and head to the sink to wash your hands. At the sink, you note the absence of soap, a hole in the sink where the hot tap is supposed to go and an empty paper towel dispenser. You rinse your hands and shake off the worst of the water. 

Hungry and disappointed, you leave, vowing never to return.",0,1357668089,null,0,1357668413,0,c7tb4zl,t3_1668x6,t1_c7tb4zl,t3_1668x6,null,1430896453,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

true,georgestroke,null,null,"My contribution based on what's below. Plus a few corrections.

1. FA Cup isn't limited to the top 4 leagues in English footy; it also includes non-league sides in the Conferences. It's massive. The League Cup is limited to League sides (top 4 tiers).

2. Many of the managers of the tops clubs -- I'm looking at you Sir Alex and Brendan Rodgers -- will make up bullshit excuses for their players when they are at fault and commit horrible fouls. Rodgers has been defending Suarez's [stamps](http://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/49930-The-Suarez-Stamps-Mirallas-amp-Distin) all year long with excuse after excuse. When Fellaini headbutted Shawcross, right after the game Moyes came out and said he should be punished and deserves what he gets. Such honestly and candour is lacking in the premiership and lots of managers defend their players no matter what. Moyes did the club proud though in the Fellaini incident. 

3. Read the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.) page for information about past history, etc. A lot is down below. As said, Neville Southall was a great keeper.

4. Some Evertonians use the term RS (Red Shite) to refer to Liverpool when discussing them in online forums. Their supporters are Kopites (there is a section in Anfield known as the Kop end). You'll see these terms a lot on the forums such as grandoldteam.com or nsno.co.uk ([Nil Satis Nisi Optimum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nil_Satis_Nisi_Optimum) being the club slogan). Go check them out.

5. Our chairman is Bill Kenwright. Many supporters don't like him and a vocal group called the Blue Union organize protests against his decisions. Basically he is untruthful to fans about future plans for the club and isn't completely honest. Many think he is trying to hold out and looking for overseas investors to take over the club.... but that he simply wants to much. Many are angry he won't use his own money to invest in the club to buy more players. The club has a debt of £46 million so it's hard to buy players like the other clubs do. The annual report just came out and the numbers weren't too good. Comb the net for [more on that.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/9779302/Everton-agree-new-deals-for-Phil-Jagielka-and-Leon-Osman-as-they-reveal-losses-rose-to-9million-last-season.html)

6. Leighton Baines is one of the best left backs in the world. Don't let people tell you otherwise.

7. Learn these two songs:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXpplGmA9Tc

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5t842UuBlw

8. The RS have tended to get the better of us in recent Merseyside Derbies. But a few memorable victories have been had by us. There was the Gosling Derby in 2009 in which he came on as a sub and scored in extra time to win against the RS. That was a FA Cup 4th round replay (the first game was a draw so they played again). Another one that sticks out for me was the 3-0 drubbing we gave the RS in 2006-07. [Here's the full list of fixtures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby#Full_list_of_results)

9. Suarez is a bellend.

10. Jelavic and Kevin Mirallas were amazing signings from last year. Both are bossing it right now but Jels is in a bit of a drought. Fellaini has proven to be worth the money we paid for him from Liege.... and Bainsey of course is just excellent.

---Johnson--Skrtel--Agger----Downing

-----------------Lucas----------------

---------Gerrard------Sahin-----------

Sterling-----------------------Suarez

----------------Sturridge--------------

Suarez will move to the left and face off against Rafael, someone who is decent at defending, but will definitely got caught off guard by someone like Suarez. Sterling will be tricky for Evra and will occupy him in the backfield.

I see Lucas and Gerrard changing roles during the match if they line up this way. Lucas will dominante the midfield and give more defensive support in the middle of the field instead of sitting just in front of the defense. Sahin will be able to dish the ball out to the Tri S's and try to work the ball into the box from there. 

Johnson is also vital in interacting with Sterling. Johnson can provide the attacking back up and be the out option should Sterling get caught in an awkward position. 

Sturridge obviously has the pace and would be good to get him in the game. 

The rest is pretty much self-explanatory. 

Edit: Sorry for posting this twice. To the person who commented on the doubled post ""I cannot see Suarez not playing center-forward"", I say this. I fully think that we will either see a rotation or a complete position change for Suarez. I think that he will be playing more on the left side, but will act as a link between the midfield and the forward options. He will be cutting in from the left leaving space for Enrique to overlap while Agger, Skrtel, and Lucas provide cover.

Tom Bombadil is unaffected by the ring, but Galadriel and Gandalf are very clear that the ring would corrupt them.  All you need to know is that it's well within a writer's prerogative to make the Doctor subject to it's charms. That's where the better story is. The doctor is much more of a Gandalf than a Bombadil. He cares. He has power and tries to use his power to do good. That is precisely what the ring would use against him. Hell, the one ring type of curse could be the sort of temptation that turns the Doctor into a character like the Valeyard (his already corrupted future self). The ring convinces him that he needs more regenerations so he can keep doing more good and the end justifies the means etc.  

Since the core power of the one ring in its lore is its ability to corrupt even the most powerful, and there is nothing in the Doctor's lore to suggest an immunity to corruption, I'd say it's more reasonable than not that the one ring would tempt the Doctor.
