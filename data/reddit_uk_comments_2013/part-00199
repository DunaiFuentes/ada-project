true,87red,null,null,"Whilst they may offer longer term security, 5 year fixes often have hefty fees and higher rates compared to shorter fixes.  Factor these fees into any calculations you make.  You might be better off finding a market leading 2-year fixed deal, then once the initial deal is over look at the 2 or 3 year fix.  By that time you might have paid off enough to be in a lower LTV band, enabling you to get a better deal.  My circumstances will be different to yours, but my initial 2 year mortgage deal was 3.49% 85% (LTV), now 2.79% (75% LTV) for the next 2 years, with only a £199 valuation fee for the original deal.

As Verochio has mentioned, this will give you more flexibility and not commit you for such a long period of time.  A lot can happen in 5 years and you don't want to be stung with early repayment charges.  HSBC's website says that ..""for Fixed or Discount Rate mortgages, customers making overpayments [..] will incur an ERC. An ERC will also apply where the customer repays, by any other method, the whole or part of their mortgage, over and above their standard monthly payment, during the fixed or discount rate period. The ERC will be 1% of the amount overpaid or repaid early multiplied by the number of years remaining of the fixed or discount rate period, reducing daily. 

For example: A customer paying off their full mortgage of GBP 100,000, who has 18 months (547 days) remaining on their fixed rate period. The ERC would be: £100,000 x 1% divided by 365 x 547 days = £1,498.63""

Accommodation is at the point that it is oversubscribed thus the only way to ensure that a person gets a place is to section them, this is a very big step and people that would just have been accommodated for short period are now sectioned. This is a very big step that have a lot of legal implications (and costs). 

The lack of accommodation means that patents may well be hours away from their support services, in one example a gentleman that I know is presently placed a two hour drive away from his mental health nurse. The nurse has to support too many people to be able to take a half a day just to drive up and see this one person so he is presently out of contact with his own support service.

Mental health is a growing problem and governmental support for anything but acute services have been cut back to nothing, this costs us all more money. Mental health problems need not be a life long illness if the person is treated and supported but present policy is to ignore this issue.

I happen to agree with a lot of his points. I'm an ex dependant alcoholic and trying to get help in the UK is very difficult. I'd been drinking for years and it was coming to a head a few years ago, I was drinking a lot and knew I had an issue ( anyway, it's a long story ) but I eventually got help through [WDP ( Westminster Drug and alcohol project ) ](http://www.wdp-drugs.org.uk/  ) but in order to get help I really had to prove I was an alcoholic and attend session after session to even get through the door. I reckon even with WDP's help it would have taken me at least another year to get anywhere near rehab. 

Put it this way, I was drinking dusk till dawn 3 to 4 bottles of wine a day with a bottle of rum chaser, I was a real fucking out of control mess. Proper dependant alcoholic. 


But... I got lucky ( if you can even call it lucky ) my girl took me to A&amp;E as I was getting chest pains and having major panic attacks so they ran an ECG and decided I wasn't having a heart attack. They were about to send me home when the doctor who ran the A&amp;E happened to walk past the booth I was in and asked me what the issue was. My girl told him I was an out of control alcoholic  and all the issues I was having and he, on the spot, decided to keep me in and detox me on librium over the course of a week or two. 

FTR this *never* happens on the NHS, I was very lucky. 

Anyway, the first 48hours they stuck me in this terminal cancer ward as it was the only bed they could find, it was fucking scary in that room  so I had a walk around. People hours from death ( two people died the first night I was there )  surrounded by their grieving immediate family and I had ( I dunno what you'd call it ) an epiphany. I realised that I could still turn this around, I wasn't like these people, I had a choice. Like that film says I guess: Live or die. 

So I did it. With the help of a Librium detox, on a drip, having my  blood pressure and heart rate constantly monitored ( it was through the roof,  Stage 2 Hypertensive ) I stopped drinking and I haven't drank since. 

As I said though, I was very lucky to get that kind of treatment on the NHS and in most cases that's all it takes, a week or two being monitored, away from booze and you break the cycle. 

Also because I'd been detoxed I was moved up the ladder with WDP from someone still an alcoholic or drug addict to someone who's stopped. That's when you get the proper care, completely different building, completely different world, a sea of calm because they now see you as someone taking your shit seriously. 

**TL;DR** So what my point here? Well yeah, in this country it's too difficult to get help if you're an alcoholic, you basically have to be right on the edge and sometimes once people get to that stage it's just too late, you can't come back. 

And also, I start my own training as a drug and alcohol mentor and counsellor in December, I intend to put my knowledge of this back into the system and try and change it as much as I can, because it's not right that we have such a massive culture of heavy drinking which leads people into all sorts of trouble yet it's so difficult trying to find help once you're there. 

FTR: I don't believe in minimum pricing or any of that other bullshit either, but I do believe that alcoholic drinks manufacturers should be made to return a minimal share of their profits back into centres like WDP

So it can work, but you've got to bear with it. For a long time I felt like they were simply waiting for me to give up.

If you have an acute need where you present a threat to yourself, others or property then you will receive urgent and intensive support as this is simple the path of lest harm. 

The problem arises with people that have none acute long term issues, those that have very real and ongoing mental health issues that are not acute but no less life devastating that fall into the cracks and just don’t get out. 

I helped create a programme (initially funded by the NHS mental health trust and county council) that addressed this issue then the cuts happened, as it is a self-funding model it managed to survive the cuts by having a structure that allowed it to come under the wing of a local charity but the development stopped at that point as the charity simply lacks the vision to move forward. 

Now my own mental illness, lack of support and poor environment has now defeated me, I know longer have an interest in trying to develop myself or improve the lives of others but, to me, the answers are rather simple but our present culture  simply does not allow for progression on this central issue.

Yes community based care is the pathway forward for health care, however with mental health you need a provision to get people out of their environment to a place of safety with the ability to support then 24/7. I have needed that a few times and the lack of provision at present means that people with issues that would benefit from short time away simply do not get it, thus they fail to escape what may well be a negative environment. This is not unlike just having a 'time out' to help you get your life back on track. The present lack of provision means that people simple are stuck within a downward spiral that a community mental health nurse vising simply fails to resolve. 

The services that helped me where those that got me out of the house and socialising with others, this is a big part of the rehabilitation of people with long term mental health issue. I used to run a number of classes and groups that made real positive differences to people with long term mental health problems (and helped me the most) but those provisions have now gone. The only one left in my area is a peer led support group that is outstanding. 

Mental health, to me, is not just dealing with acute symptoms but in fact trying to support the person to make real life changes to ensure that they never again walk this path at present that provision is simply not there, I wanted to help develop that but unfortunately I would have needed that to progress.

true,CA3080,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 by the Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu in Berlin, Germany.[3] He named the compound phenylisopropylamine. It was one of a series of compounds related to the plant derivative ephedrine, which had been isolated from the plant Ma-Huang (Ephedra) that same year by Nagayoshi Nagai.[4] No pharmacological use was found for amphetamine until 1927, when pioneer psychopharmacologist Gordon Alles resynthesized and tested it on himself, in search of an artificial replacement for ephedrine. From 1933 or 1934 Smith, Kline and French began selling the volatile base form of the drug as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine, useful as a decongestant but readily usable for other purposes.[5] One of the first attempts at using amphetamine in a scientific study was done by M. H. Nathanson, a Los Angeles physician, in 1935. He studied the subjective effects of amphetamine in 55 hospital workers who were each given 20 mg of Benzedrine. The two most commonly reported drug effects were ""a sense of well being and a feeling of exhilaration"" and ""lessened fatigue in reaction to work"".[6] During World War II amphetamine was extensively used to combat fatigue and increase alertness in soldiers. After decades of reported abuse, the FDA banned Benzedrine inhalers, and limited amphetamine to prescription use in 1965, but non-medical use remained common.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Part of the problem the NHS has (aside from resources) is that it's still mainly run on a model of mental health that thinks it knows more than it actually does. This is the medical model (so one that treats mental health as a physical pathology or disease) and while the treatments it offers help some people some of the time, there are huge gaping holes in both it's knowledge and utility. That's not to say that the medical model is useless or that any other model holds definitive answers - none of them do - but the problem arises from the fact that it assumes we know far more than we actually do. 

For example:

1. We still have no idea what consciousness really is.

2. Many of the medical model's touchstones are riddled with chicken and egg problems. Look at the bio-medical explanation for many of the disorders we encounter. They all hinge on changes in brain chemistry and on the face of it, there is some validity to this: If you look at the levels of neurotransmitters in certain disorders and you'll find distinct differences from the everyday brain. However, we still have no idea if these chemical changes are causing the disorder of if the disorder is causing the changes. Now that may sound like a minor quibble but the implications are huge on a very fundamental level.

3. You know all those fMRI scans (those pretty pictures that show brain activity) that are wheeled out on the news with headlines such as 'Brain area for empathy located'? Yeah, take those with a massive pinch of salt. What they actually show is where blood flows to in the brain when you put someone in a tube and ask them abstract questions in a an artificial environment.

4. Its treatments can be harsher than the underlying condition. If you've ever spent time with someone whose anti-psychotics are not working as they should you'll know what I'm talking about.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not totally poo-pooing the medical model here because it can and does save lives but in terms of the NHS it is still the one with the most sway and it has the effect of sidelining more imaginative and often useful approaches.

However, resources are the big one and yes, you do have to be screamingly mad for something to be done. This is because the resources have never been there and ultimately you are going to spend those resources on stopping people from hurting/killing themselves before you spend them on recovery. As there is so little to go around, I'd say about 85% of the NHS are directed towards that end. This is nothing new.... It's been the 'normal' for mental health since I started out working in it over 10 years ago but it is getting worse. The part in the article that mentioned that there were no beds at all *in the entire country* shows just how bad it is and this will get worse (it's very rare these days that I'm truly shocked by MH revelations but that one is shocking). Demand is going up, way way beyond the capacity to supply appropriate help and it won't be long before we start hearing some really grizzly stories in the press (not that there's been a lack of grizzly stories.... it's just that they don't make for good copy unless there's some 'mad axeman' angle to it).

This is really bad news because the one thing that does seem to help people recover is time - time with people who have time themselves to explore all the approaches available and to think in non-doctrinal and imaginative way. However, time costs money and as is clear, money is something MH services have very little of.

We all know what gylfi can't do:
- he can't or won't beat his man on the outside very often. He will almost always look to cut inside. 
- he isn't creative enough to play at 10. 
- he won't stun anyone with pace. 
- can't really cross with his left foot. Has done it before, but with limited success.

However, his plusses far outweigh those negatives. His positional sense is generally very good. His discipline on the field in terms of sticking to his role is excellent, especially considering LW is not his favoured position. He can strike a ball as well as any midfielder in the league. He will score a lot of goals this season. He is industrious, and always gives everything for the team. 

I also agree with OP that his link up play with the rest of the team is good, and It would appear that he plays well with both lewis and eriksen in the centre. 

One thing I would say is that siggy suffered having naughton behind him instead of rose against Cardiff. Not just because naughton got caught so often, but because as a right footer he was generally passing away from gylfi, leaving the Icelander a little stranded. And even then siggurdson struck the bar so hard he burst the ball! 

**tl;dr   siggurdson over chadli as first choice LW for now. Chadli needs to improve to shift the Icelander.**

As I understand it the Scottish government has no objection to the Royal Navy operating out of Scottish ports and in Scottish waters, I don't even think they are all that concerned about Nuclear *powered* submarines it is more the placement of one of the largest stockpiles of the most destructive weapons known to man 25 miles from our largest population centre that concerns them, can't say I disagree with them on that.

Obviously it would take some time to outfit either Portsmouth or Devon to carry Trident so I can see there being some sort of deal in which Trident will continue to be stationed in Scotland until other arrangements can be made (with a deadline obviously), if the Scottish government does also want to remove nuclear submarines from our waters then Devon can easily be used, as the re basing of the attack subs from Devon to Faslane wont be complete until 2017 so it's a ""simple"" matter of reversing that process.

With the relocation to Portsmouth (I understand that that is the most seriously considered option) you could see a shift in the politics of Trident, It's easy to say that they are necessary weapons when they are 400 miles away, It's a little more worrying when they're 50 (or even in the case of Devon 150) miles away and you know in the event of a nuclear war that the area you live will be blanketed first",0,1379934756,null,0,false,0,ccdq9p5,t3_1mx5vp,t1_ccdq9p5,t1_ccdpwn8,null,1429371614,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Truth is the economy is in the toilet in both France and the UK (more so France) - especially with your (assuming) lack of French ability. 

I'll be honest - I quite like the climate in the UK. It's cool so you're not hot all the time but almost every Aussie I ever met hated the climate in the UK and I must admit if you're used to sun the perpetual greyness can be god damned exhausting (took me a while to adjust after being abroad for a few years).
 
The rental market - again we can't help with a hint of where you're going. In london it's fucking horrendous. It's less horrendous in other cities and if you're coming here on a menial wage I would advise against London. You can visit relatively easy for weekend getaways at some point and experience london and avoid the daily grind of having your face in someones arm pit on the tube and spending half an hour on the tube to get anywhere.
 
4500 is enough to set yourself up in most cities. 

For reference I pay £850 rent in Bristol, + 100 for council tax, bills are around £120 so for a nice 2 bed house with 2 lounges I'm paying £1070 a month. For a two bed flat you can be paying anything between 500-900 depending on how far/close to the city you want to be. Remember to add £100 for council tax (an arbitrary tax we created during WW2 then kept after it).

Out of interest where is your gf from in France? We're moving to Lyon next sept

&gt;vs Chelsea

                  Lloris

    Walker - Dawson - Kaboul - Vertonghen

       Paulinho - Sandro - Eriksen

        Lamela - Soldado - Siggurdson

Granted that, I think starters vs Villa should include Naughton, Chiriches, Dembele, Holtby and Townsend. Given Lamela is still quite fresh, I think he can play a fair few minutes in both matches and Villa time will help him settle.

          Dembele - ? - Holtby

I think subs should be used to rest Walker / Dawson at about the 60th minute. Ideally Defoe is fit but not sure how he is tracking, also need a true DM but I don't think Sandro would handle 90 mins in both games, so not yet sure who to play.

EDIT: Adebayor tweeted he is in training. Would like to see him start against Villa with Kane off of the bench.

So Google is kinda scary because if you use their ecosystem, they know pretty much everything about you and have built their revenue system on being able to do that better than anyone else.

But Tesco and the like know everything you buy.  I remember reading a story about someone who worked for a US retailer, who had a very angry complaint from a parent, their daughter had been sent customised marketing information for someone who was pregnant, the girl was only 17.  It turned out that her shopping habbits had changed, not enough that she herself realised it, but enough that the modelling used was able to accurately predict that she was up the duff.

The likes of the clubcard system they know your mood, your health, your sexual activities any shameful problems will probably be also highly available.

And now they are trying to get you more involved, outside of the store.  Their On-Demand TV service is free, because they can show you far more relevant adverts than google.  If you watch an advert for new superhealthy oatychocolate bar fat slab, you might not click it on youtube, but if you did buy it in your next shop, Tesco will know.  They can really accurately model your conversion, plus they know precisely what you do buy?  Always buy generic brand frozen pizza?  Prepare for endless adverts about the better quality fresh, finest ones.  Oh and guess what, you'll even get a 50p off voucher too!

Its fun to sculpt things and paint them, you learn a lot about balancing colour and get to play with dangerous chemicals (I air brush floor polish, as its the best varnish I've ever found). And er.. at the end you feel like you've achieved something and hold a little dude in your hand you can pose like an action figure you didn't just spend 30 hours working on..

Its an interesting hobby where slicing part of your thumb off is considered a rite of passage not an accident. If you haven't drawn blood you're just not experienced enough is how it goes.

Its also very Zen like, you spend a good 5+ hours just clipping parts off a sprue and cleaning them up, putting them together as the 10 page instructions dictate. Then filling in gaps and fixing nicks, before sitting down to paint them either with an airbrush (lots of fun) or a normal brush. Neither of which takes a lot of attention (occasionally it does), but requires you to keep your shit steady and be careful. So its the perfect amount of chilled out and focus to give you a clear head, while not being empty headed and going down that shitty over thinking place you get when you're bored.

I would call that my main ""hobby"", even though I do other stuff more. It feels like something I do as a hobby instead of just ""general life stuff"".

Would I recommend it to others? Possibly. But it depends what you're into, the UK scene is mostly military based and airfix kits are shite but every where. Unless you want to pay 2-3 times the mark up the best way to get kits is to buy from Japan and wait 2 weeks.

In an ideal world, we could do whatever we want and be totally responsible for ourselves, but obviously that doesn't happen. It's why we have high taxes - otherwise I could just save more money myself for a rainy day and never need benefits or government pension schemes. But the government reduce your freedom (by taxing you) because many people wouldn't be responsible. I should be allowed to drive drunk, because if I don't cause an accident then it was totally fine. I should be able to shoot a gun into a crowd of people, as long as it doesn't injure anybody or damage personal property. That would be ultimate personal freedom but obviously there's a balance between the two somewhere, and with drugs the vast majority of countries say that the balance is legal and regulated alcohol and keeping other drugs illegal to discourage use.

I didn't suggest that we should prohibit alcohol. Obviously that wouldn't work, not to mention that it's already heavily legislated. I'm just making the point that legalisation doesn't magically solve all problems in the way that many people claim it would. It's perfectly possible to abuse legal drugs, and for that abuse to cause problems to the country as a whole. So as far as I can see, legalisation doesn't really solve any of the problems that we currently have with drug abuse.

Notices you've started buying less biscuits, chocolate and crisps?  Your new more healthy diet might mean buying less profitable lines.  Time to see lots of adverts every time you watch, reminding you to consume that product you bought earlier.

It is often accepted its a good idea to restrict advertising of things that are addictive / unhealthy.  Cigs and Junk Food for instance.  But what about something that isn't really best for you, but you have a weakness for?

When they know nothing about you, they can't really be that decisive to try and make you buy something.

For fucks sake. Stop spending money on shit, especially when it doesn't actually solve the root cause of the problem.

I don't want to be a dependent, sucking on the government tits for help paying rent, getting money for my kids, getting help with childcare and everything else. Just let people earn a decent living and they will happily pay for those things themselves when they need them.

The great thing about shooting is that it can be as relaxed or as intense as you want, it's highly social (you can go with mates, join a team etc.) and like any good sport it has infinite potential for talking bollocks, as it's full of strange terminology and techniques. 

It can be pricey but it really doesn't have to be - you don't have to own a shotgun license to shoot, and shooting grounds usually offer deals to groups. The sense of satisfaction when you hit a difficult clay dead on and it explodes into dust is hard to beat.

Once you get into it and get yourself to a decent standard, there's huge room for variation and playing to your strengths and preferences, as there are several official disciplines. Some focus more on speed, others endurance and consistency, and others on your adaptability to shoot unpredictable targets.

Finally, guns are just fucking fun, and the smell of cordite/gunpowder is enough to get you addicted to shooting by itself.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I've been thinking about a 4-4-2 as well, but I don't think Lucas/Gerrard can play as the middle 2.  Neither of them has much mobility to offer and we'd need at least one of them going box to box.  Henderson becomes the perfect candidate for this as he'll run for days with no problem.  Maybe Gerrard goes on the right with freedom to drift?  With Toure/Wisdom at right back there won't be much attacking instinct coming from there so it would be reasonable cover for Gerrard if he moves inside or doesn't recover well once or twice.  

The thing that makes this formation a really attractive option for me is that Suarez likes to drop a bit deep to get the ball and set things in motion. At times the way he does this is very similar to the way that Wayne Rooney plays when he's partnered with RVP.  United has any 2 of Fellaini, Carrick, Anderson, Cleverly sitting in behind their 2 forwards and none of those players have a particularly outstanding attacking mindset or ability.  Rooney bridges the gap between them extremely well, in combination with their fast and tricky wingers.  We have some pacey wingers of our own now in Moses and Sterling, an absolutely world class second forward in Suarez, a front man who can hold the line and play with the ball at his feet in Sturridge, and an intelligent midfield duo in whoever gets the nod between Lucas, Henderson, Gerrard, and Allen.  It sucks to be drawing comparisons to United but we have a set of players who could make really good use of this kind of setup in Coutinho's absence.  I'm not sure if this is something that can be executed well enough to carry the day against a powerhouse like United seeing as how we'll have had very little time to train it, but it's fun to think about.

If BR does decide to keep things the same then he has to play Suarez in Coutinho's normal position.  He's the only other player with a reasonably similar skill set and ability on the ball to play there.  He'll be far more direct and aggressive going forward than Coutinho, but he'll make a great outlet and starting point for springing fast transitions.  It's a bit of a shame to pull him further away from the goal but I'm sure he'll figure out how to get involved in the scoring pretty much immediately.",0,1379944165,null,0,false,0,ccdry57,t3_1my4es,t1_ccdry57,t1_ccdppzr,null,1429370830,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

Coutinho is in a similar role to Rooney/Kagawa. Most of our creativity comes from them.

I too doubt our ability to play a strict 4-4-2. All that matters in my eyes is getting the best out of Suarez. If he gets enough of the ball he will create chances, he will get us up the pitch and score goals. Sturridge can stretch defences with his pace. If the opposition drops deep to stop Sturridge being played in by Suarez then we don't look weak in central midfield because they can push up without being pressed.

Apparently they are rather fond of the idea, the only significant objection is from UK politicians. It doesn't answer the question of strategic access to the G-I-UK gap, but I wonder if the nuclear 'boomers' really need that anyway - they're supposed to be providing deterrence from far away offshore, and only coming back to port at the start and end of routine patrols, surely?  
I understand why attack subs need somewhere like Faslane to quickly deploy military force into that gap, but ideally, it shouldn't matter where the missile boats are (they aren't called 'intercontinental' rockets for nothing).

There's always Northern Ireland - except that'd create ten times the shitstorm. 

I suggest the Falklands. The logistics will be impossible, but the Argentinians will get hilariously angry; the islanders should support it; since only 2,000 people live there, the coastline is full of underused natural harbours on solid geology; it is remote in the event of a major accident.

Don't cycle on the pavement/sidewalks. 98% of the time it's illegal, and on those bits where it's not, most pedestrians don't realise and will step out in front of you more regularly than they do on the roads.

Most taxis aren't out to get you, but there's definitely a percentage that are. Again, just be more aware.

true,fourth_floor,null,null,"That only makes it worse. So where do you want to begin, with the transfers in the early 80s or the 90s? Liverpool broke the british transfer record in 1995 with Stan Collymore - £8.5m. On a per revenue football inflation basis, that is much greater than the City transfers and today is about the equivalent of spending £100m on a player (revenue then was £20m a season - we spent 50% of revenue on one player). 

Going back further signing Dalglish was the equivalent of double Andy Carroll - and Liverpool FC broke the transfer record again. £440,000 doesn't sound like a lot today, but when you consider at the same time that entire top division football clubs were being bought and sold for a little more than that it puts it into perspective. The Dalglish transfer was also heavily criticized for being excessive. 

Fact is that every big or ambitious club has been through periods where they invest heavily. You can't grow a club any other way. Fans today have a selective memory because previously the sums were a lot smaller - football wasn't growing nearly as quickly as it is today (football clubs have doubled in size twice in only the past 10 years). 

So while £8M for Collymore, £15m for Shearer, £1.5M for Cantona, the same for Keane, £440,000 for Dalglish etc. don't sound like 'big' transfers the fact is that when you normalize these sums based on revenue each of these transfers is much, much larger than modern transfers (more money goes into wages today).

The irony here is that it was Liverpool, United and Newcastle who have made some of the largest financial investments in football history in order to get big yet it is the fans of these clubs who today complain about City, Chelsea - even though their spending is less, comparatively.",0,1379946576,null,0,false,0,ccdski2,t3_1l4837,t1_ccdski2,t1_ccdguhu,null,1429370470,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

This, combined with the fact that they take a long time to take effect and often require the dose increasing several times before they do, means that it can take a *long* time to get the right medication at the right dose. Please don't give up though, they can be very effective for some people (while I have not had much luck myself, I have a friend who swears by fluoxetine, it has helped him a lot).   

In the mean time, keep bugging your doctor for additional treatment, try to make them understand that it is seriously affecting your life; I know this is easier said than done but it is worth persevering with. If you find that your GP is not listening, or you find them difficult to talk to, then you are well within your rights to ask to see someone else; try looking at your local practices website and see if any of the Doctors listed specialise in mental health, if they don't then try to find one who is easy to talk to (personally I find women easier to express my feelings to, male doctors intimidate me for some reason). Another good trick is to write down your problems before you go and take the list in with you. This helps a lot when trying to express yourself if you are anything like me and go to pieces when asked to talk about stuff.    

Anyway, it can take a while but they should be able to offer you some sort of therapy (CBT usually) and if that doesn't work you can be passed on to a specialist mental health team. This is where I am now but it took me a long time to get here and I've been through pretty much every antidepressant in the book on the way here. If there's one thing I've learned though it's that you do have to keep pushing to get anywhere because the service is so limited.

So these adverts that constantly remind us about McDonalds? They're ensuring that everybody in the country is familiar with McDonalds and is more familiar with that than any of their competitors. So if given a choice between McDonalds and Fast Food X, absent any other strong preferences many people will choose McDonalds purely because of the deluge of advertising and branding that they have experienced over their lives.

It worked too. Walcott was put through for two one-on-one's that Lloris reacted very well to, whereas Tottenham were frustrated and lacked creativity for much of the match.

One thing Siggy possesses is a clinical finish in the box that is not matched by Chadli.  This was evidenced in the game last week as he took that intricate pass from Eriksen and swiftly dispatched it without a wind up into the right side of the goal.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think with Siggy the issue is a little like Dempsey last season in that he isn't naturally suited to play on the wing in our system. Chadli and Lennon are carrying knocks.  I personally would have liked to have seen Lamela and Andros on the pitch together on the wings but we went with Siggy and asked him to play out on the left.

Both Dempsey and Siggy are more naturally suited to sit in behind the striker as the most advanced midfielder, last season Bale sat in that role for a portion of the season and forced Dempsey and Siggy out on the left (Siggy was stronger in that role than Dempsey last season in my opinion) this season Eriksen plays in that slot and serves as our most creative player on the pitch.  Means we can't put Siggy in that advanced CAM slot and are going to be forced to put him into a role that isn't natural for him.

I think we can really get some good play from Siggy, but when he is on the left we have to accept that he is more of a band-aid than a true solution for that position, i think when Chadli is healthy we will see him back on the left with Siggy moving back to the bench.

One of the reasons for having these laws (there are similar ones for race, gender, and religion, I think) is that the judicial system has a history of discriminating against certain groups of people.  For example, it used to be that if you attacked a gay guy, you would claim that you were so disgusted by his gayness that you were rendered temporarily insane, and the judge would give you a reduced sentence.  I don't think members of the armed forces are in danger of being discriminated against in this way.

Another reason is that hate crimes contribute to oppression and intimidation of a class of people - if you feel that soldiers are oppressed, you can always quit (or not join up in the first place) - you can't exactly change your race, gender, disabilities, or sexual orientation (and most devoutly religious people would say they can't change their religion).",0,1379958569,null,0,false,0,ccdwe0q,t3_1my9u9,t1_ccdwe0q,t1_ccdqifi,null,1429368688,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Research by the RAC Foundation suggests drivers aged 75 and over make up 6% of all licence holders but account for just 4.3% of all deaths and serious injuries. By contrast, drivers aged 16-20 make up just 2.5% of all drivers but 13% of those killed and seriously injured.

How do the figures look when you normalise for miles driven? For insurance purposes raw numbers are all that matter. If you want to talk about objective safety though you need to normalise for actual miles done on the road.

It might easily be the case that elderly drivers drive about 10th of the miles of the average driver. In which case a 30% drop in accidents looks less impressive. There might still be a case for extra testing if particular sets of drivers are more likely to create problems per mile driven. For instance it is pretty hard to actually get rid of general accidents on a motorway. If somebody is doing 100k miles a year they are going to have some close calls occasionally and you aren't going to fix it by further education. If somebody is hitting a much higher accident/mile ratio on small mileage it is likely they are actually doing something wrong. Testing and education might well help fix it (or at least disqualify those that really shouldn't be on the road).

Regardless it is 100% pointless to even have this debate until driving figures are routinely normalised for journey miles rather than weird ""percentage of road users"".",0,1379959167,null,0,1379959393,0,ccdwlon,t3_1mywci,t1_ccdwlon,t3_1mywci,null,1429368588,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

A gimlet is my girlfriend's favourite drink- 3 shots of dryish gin (Hendrick's would be fine but it's just as good with cheaper stuff imo), 1 shot of lime juice and some sugar to taste, stirred over ice and then strained. If you can find celery bitters anywhere a couple of drops change the flavour completely and make it a bit earthier.

I love a negroni, myself- you can play around with the volumes of each ingredient but it's basically equal parts gin, Campari and vermouth (as sweet or dry as you like it). Stir them in a glass with ice and pop a twist a slice of orange peel over it, then dump it in the glass. Brilliant for a hangover, that one.

Hendrick's is quite nice for a French 75, too- it's a shot of gin, a half shot of lemon juice and a half shot of gomme or just caster sugar (couple of teaspoons should do the job), mixed over ice and then strained into a glass that's then topped up with champagne/prosecco/cava/meths. Well, maybe not meths. Might just be a Scottish thing.

The life sentence he has recieved will govern his life until he dies. He will be subject to strict conditions, and can be recalled to jail at any point, without further trial or sentence. It could not be called anything other than a life sentence, because that it precisely how long it lasts.

That's what a life sentence means. It has essentially nothing to do with the specific term of imprisonment, which is often handled at an entirely different time.

I appreciate it is referred to wrongly by media agencies as ""jailed for life"", and that is frankly wrong and misleading of them. Its a frustrating convention that is somewhat irreseponsible and bad for public confidence in justice. However the life sentence has never referred to a period in prison, nor was it ever intended too. Indeed historically the terms of imprisonment served were shorter than they are today.

There are lots of sentences which involve no time in custody whatsoever. They are still sentences. An 18 month community order is an 18 month sentence, despite not involving even a moment in jail.

I wish I hadn't bothered.  
The instructions are... shall we say... not quite grammatically correct, almost to the point of uselessness.  
I have never been able to get the clock set on the damned thing. Apparently you write the time and date in a specific text file on the SD card, then turn on the camera and it resets the internal clock to whatever is in the text file. But no, no matter which encoding I save the text file as, it's still the year 2000 as far as the camera knows. If you were trying to show this in court as evidence, the opposing barrister is going to get this thrown out in about 5 seconds. Also, you have to guess what time in the camera's boot sequence it will read the file so that you can make it at least plausibly accurate.  
Let's say you worked around these limitations somehow. And good for you! What happens if someone walks out in front of you at night? You're stuffed. The black light LEDs will illuminate nothing more distant than their own reflection in the windshield glass. The camera will barely see a brake light at night, let alone a number plate.  
And then there's reliability.  
Often the camera will freeze when starting up, and you'll have to find a paper clip to push the reset switch. And if you do that, you just lost your camera resolution and frame rate settings.

exactly how much job seekers allowance budget could be replaced by the subsidisation we give the royal family?

What about the amount given to oil and gas drilling in the north sea as 'subsidies' but then that's all 'worth it' and 'we'll get it back'.

How about the reinstatement of ema and decent training of young people instead of ten days of running and jumping in a shiny new stadium that was stretched out for three years poorly?

I remember talking to a man who turned out to be an ex stockbroker about this country's economy, he said the problem is that they pay people too much on benefits and that's the problem with country's finances (from the mouth of a fucking banker!).

Paulinho's goal was a tap in. A beautiful backheel, but a tap in nonetheless. How about Soldado? If tap ins are so easy, why hasn't he put his chances away? In reality, a goal is a goal. Who cares how it's scored?

&gt; Plus I recall him missing some sitters vs crystal palace

You contradict yourself here. Why do you bother to put him down for missing ""sitters"" when you just implied yourself that a tap in doesn't count? 

You take things out of context to try and make Gylfi look bad when in reality he's not. I don't know what he ever did to you to make you so obsessed with arguing that he's shit, but it's tiring.

Of course he's my favorite player, but I can objectively look at things while it seems to me that you fail to do so. I know I exaggerate how good he is a lot of the time, just because I love him. He's not the best player we have for sure but he is not the worst. He's one of the most technically gifted players we have and if you don't see that, you're blind. I can say that he has his shortcomings and can sometimes be a detriment to the squad (especially with keeping his width, but he did better yesterday so that complaint from me is gone). But if we put the facts together, he's scored 40% of our league goals, he's come close to scoring numerous times to have the post, crossbar, or god-mode keeper deny him, and as he's shown on national duty, he can be deadly on set pieces.

I'd say that I look forward to Gylfi proving you wrong this season, but I know that even if he scored 15+ goals and got 15+ assists you would still be arguing against him.

Did you have an offer to get an 8.0 and miss that offer? Or did you never apply, and were planning to apply in this round using the results you just got? Note that the deadline for applications for October 2014 entry is 15 October *2013*, so unless you are preparing to have a personal statement ready, have your application on UCAS online, and your current grades are good enough to get you a conditional offer; you won't be applying until next year, so you won't be getting in until *2015*. You do still have 3 weeks to get your application prepared if you haven't already (and bare in mind you'll need to go for interview in December).

Anyway, I'm going to be honest, I have no idea what the course for the Dutch diploma is like for Maths and Economics. However it would be very easy for you to find past papers and course specifications for English exam-boards so you can found out what our exams are like. Just go onto any exam-board's website (popular exam-boards include AQA, Edexcel and OCR) and these documents should be quite easy to find. You should use these to gauge just how much work you will need to do to align yourself with the standards they expect for Cambridge. I do expect that you'll find you have already learnt most of what you need to, and that you shouldn't find it too difficult to self-teach the rest of the stuff this year.

I personally have done an A-level in Maths (Edexcel), and an AS-level in Economics (OCR). Both of these subjects are modular, meaning that there are different topics you can choose (to an extent). You'll have to make yourself comfortable with exactly how your chosen exam-board does things, as although the content is similar board to board, it is spread out differently between modules. This does give you some flexibility in lining up the Dutch diploma with the A-level exam-board it is most like.

Also, don't forget you need to apply (and pay) for the exams once you've decided on your exam-board and modules! Best of luck with your application :)",0,1379963286,null,0,1379963474,0,ccdy2uv,t3_1mz3c0,t1_ccdy2uv,t3_1mz3c0,null,1429367899,1,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,1

Having lived in UAE for sometime this is most likely due to the lazy dubai police being retarded but it is rather unusual that it's taken this long, although Dubai police literally do as they wish and no one, no matter how powerful will stop them (unless someone has connections to one of the royal families). As for consular assistance, the British embassy in Abu Dhabi routinely gives no fucks when it comes to assisting citizens in trouble in the UAE. They know how messed up the legal system is and don't want to risk relations with the Emiratis by making individual cases an issue.

true,soothfast,eng-dorset,Dorset - Who's afear'd!,"I have some experience here.  My mother was very ill last year with depression and the care she had locally was bloody awful.  Not that the care wasn't there - it was getting her to the right people.  First of all she had to go through her GP who was next to utterly useless.  Why is it that if you go to the GP with say a serious kidney issue (as an example) you are referred straight to hospital to see a specialist.  But with a mental health condition the GP seems to think that no referring is necessary and they will deal with it.  When they haven't a clue how to.  So my poor mother just got worse and worse with her GP chopping and changing her tablets willy nilly and mum getting sicker and sicker.  To cut a very long story short we personally rang local NHS residential places for mental health patients in desperation as the GP kept fobbing us of. We told them the state she was in. Turned out that her local area had a specialist mental health nurse for people of retirement age.  The GP NOT ONCE gave us any indication that such a person existed in her local area.  Got in touch with the nurse immediately.  Later that DAY she was around and a few days later mum was in hospital.  The GP was pretty angry that we had ""gone behind his back"" but we were desperate and at our wits end.  The fact he seemingly had no idea that a nurse specialising in mental health worked in his own local area beggared belief.  All the weeks my mum had to suffer.  It was uttery disgusting.  I wanted to complain buy my dad refused not wanting to ""rock the boat with the GP any more than we had done already"". But that's his generation for you and he was adamant.  

She is much better now I am glad to say, and now we have a contact to ring that doesn't involve the useless doctor's surgery.  The care she got in the end was very good but getting to that point was soul destroying.

He hasnt got a chance to tap-in............

&gt; Why do you bother to put him down for missing ""sitters"" when you just implied yourself that a tap in doesn't count?

Theres a difference between a sitter and a tap-in

&gt; You take things out of context to try and make Gylfi look bad when in reality he's not..  but I can objectively look at things while it seems to me that you fail to do so

According to whoscored statistics hes been our tenth best performer.... according to squawka hes our 11th best performer per game..... Is that objective and in context enough for you?? Also hes created the least chances and made the least key passes per game of any other of our attacking players

And neither of those websites are factoring in the two legs vs dinamo where he was outrageously poor

&gt; I can say that he has his shortcomings and can sometimes be a detriment to the squad (especially with keeping his width, but he did better yesterday so that complaint from me is gone

WOW now i realy kno you are not seeing things straight... did you not see how much a vacuum of creativity the left side of the pitch was?? the ball would go there and then go straight back to a CM player.. Our team shape was poor yesterday as our attacks almost always revolved(same in the norwich game aswell) around a townsend, eriksen and walker triangle due to siggy not fitting the position

&gt; he's come close to scoring numerous times to have the post, crossbar, or god-mode keeper deny him

excuses

&gt; I'd say that I look forward to Gylfi proving you wrong this season

Hes proved me right every time hes played on the wing imo... The two dinamo legs... against tromso, yesterday and even against norwich where other than the two goals he did nothing, the ball would go to the leftside of the pitch and then immediately return to the centre.. theres no penetration and it makes us predictable..  its not his fault, its because hes playing out of position

&gt; but I know that even if he scored 15+ goals and got 15+ assists you would still be arguing against him

he got 3 goals and 4 assists in 33 pl apps last season so id hold my breath on that

In the end of the day i think that you are completely misunderstanding what i am saying!!... i think he is a very good player,not once have i said otherwise! i just think that he is poor on the wing and that often him being on the wing comes as a detriment to the overall fluency of our performances

I geuninely am enjoying debate so pls respnd

I think we would have sold him to Madrid if they came in early enough with a decent offer.  Our option was stand firm, or sell him to Arsenal for way less than what he was worth to us.  

Suarez has been a pain every season for different reasons, but we knew that when we bought him. He forced his way out of one club into Ajax and got a heavy ban for biting with Ajax.  ",0,1379965326,null,0,false,0,ccdyuqp,t3_1myk4b,t1_ccdyuqp,t1_ccdvpoh,null,1429367538,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I very much doubt it is familiarity. I have been using Android devices for years, longer than I had my iPad. It's not true that 'Not a single review has mentioned it being slow at all', The Verge said it stuttered when scrolling.

My point was really about the smoothness of the browser. Everything else is smooth on the N7, as smooth as my iPad 3, but the browser experience is not nearly as nice. On the iPad I could load up a complex webpage like The Guardian or BBC News and just zip up and down with very little lag, tracking my finger perfectly. Zooming was just as instant and natural.

I think it being just shy of 63% is very impressive given where it was a few decades ago. I've worked on outreach programs for Cambridge and the one thing I hear time and time again is ""I just don't think it's for me"". The brightest state school pupils are being put off because it is articles like these that shape their opinion of Oxbridge. The problem is not the University. The problem is the Oxbridge myth and the sensationalism every negative story is treated with. For every exaggerated and embellished horror story there are hundreds of tales of academic and personal fulfilment. If you're right for Oxbridge they don't care where you're from or what school you went to. The biggest barrier to underprivileged kids not getting in is them not applying in the first place, and articles like these are a primary cause.

Right now, our best line to put behind Soldado is probably Sigurdsson-Eriksen-Lamela, with there being cases for Townsend, Chadli and Lennon to be used on the wings. Players like Holtby don't necessarily need much consistency to keep their form up, but it's obvious that Siggy does and we saw that last year when he was used out wide consistently and played well. It's also worth having Siggy in over Townsend because Townsend will take 10 shots with 6 being blocked, 2 into the stands and 2 straight at the keeper; while Siggy will take three and you'd think that he'll stop hitting the frame of the goal at some point.

The question I would ask is how significant were Mata's 'failings' compared to what he brought to the team? Not very, I don't think. Were other players/ squad strength more responsible for our shortcomings? Almost definitely.

That is why I find the treatment of Mata so baffling. It seems there must be a reason beyond pure footballing terms. There must be an element of Mourinho saying to the squad: 'you aren't having all your way, and I'll show you that by taking the best player last year and sitting him the stands'. There must be more to it, because on a simply footballing basis, we have seen with our own eyes the evidence of what Mata gives us.

We play Tottenham on Saturday; who remembers Mata's performance in that game last year? Who actually thinks we would be weaker as a team if he played number 10 against Spurs?

true,R4tb3lly,lfc68,,"Lol I am not sure where you got the idea I was angry, he made a comment, and I made a comment that was thorough and explained itself. And actually with my avid viewership, including his debut and him becoming the youngest player to captain a Ligue 1 side team, I have scene that his technique is actually quite good. He has an immense passing range, a great first touch, and great vision when it comes to quick counter attacks out the back. 

Up until 2011 when PSG was bought by the QIA, Sahko's place was never in question. Then Kombouaré got sacked and Ancellotti came in. After a couple shaky performances later on in 2012 Carlo stripped him of the captaincy and benched him. He preferred Biševac and Alex to Sahko, and their own Sporting Director called him ""overweight"", yes Leonardo thinks Sahko is overweight. 

The reason PSG let him go is because they had there eye on a different squad they wanted, yes he is a baby of PSG, but the owners are not the ones who were there raising him. Just because they so readily acquired another class defender doesn't prove anything about Sahko's quality. Benitez was more than ready to sign Gareth Barry and sit Alonso, but surely Alonso was not playing like shite, actually quite the opposite. You bring in new people with new ideas, especially people like owners of the club, a coach with different philosophies, and a director to run your transfers and some players become less important. Danny failed at Chelsea and look at him now. 

These 'weak points' that you are putting out are obvious transitional changes necessary for the EPL. Like I said, I have followed him his whole career, and if you as well have done that, then there is no way you can say he lacks technique, that's one of the reasons Rodger's acquired him. 

All in all no one is angry, you may have perceived my text as an attack but I like to thoroughly respond and it was misinterpreted as malicious, when it was me disagreeing with someone and explaining my opinion.

Explain what I get from trying to explain what you are trying to not admit? Explain what you are adding to this? Yes let me give you lots of info so you can nitpick some non salient tangent. What are you trying to achieve here? You have no idea what it takes to change people, and you have no reason to prioritize the most undeserving over their victims for this treatment, the biggest slap in the face you could dream up and the most dysfunctional repulsive way you could organize society.

Explain what you think happens when criminals leave early. To the victims, to ordinary people trying to get by the right way? Who would want to participate in a society that taxes good members and rewards pernicious members?

Your answer doesn't answer my answer, you are merely saying words.
It is false economy to not imprison / expel people who are a malicious drain on society. It renders social contracts meaningless. If police protected one town better than another, house prices would adjust, people would move, nobody wants what you are offering, even you would move, it is only your lack of power that protects you from your own nonsensical ideas. The main drive of human endeavor is toward peace and prosperity, we make money so we can first feed ourselves then raise kids in safety. Given that there is a food surplus that leaves the second for our incomes to go toward - not that it needs to be expensive.

The Mexican model. Put them in a building with guards to stop them leaving, refuse to assist in the rest. Big walls, food heating and beds. It's not that expensive.

Beyond that what we can do is unlimited, they have given up the option of societies protection.
The real question is what is cheaper, separating criminals from society or not - given that for them to be arrested they have to have shown a desire to steal (literally or metaphorically) from society. Why go through the expense of having a police force at all if you are then going to make them pointless by not removing the criminals they spend their time tracking down. Why make money the right way if there is little punishment for making it the wrong way.

*""This is something potentially astonishing about how life could be lived and the limitations on human freedom""*

Potentially, could, maybe, might ... yada yada. And the moon *could* be made of cheese, but it isn't.

The entire article is one long round of supposition and postulating, with not one damn piece of hard evidence to support it save the word of a ""whistleblower"" who is merely confirming things we've always suspected was happening since the 50s and quite frankly didn't care two hoots about it.

When Wikileaks obtained classified stuff, they just released it and let the world decide for themselves what is important. Snowden simply set up (a presumably) very lucrative and exclusive deal with the Guardian, and let them *exclusively* ""tell us what to think"". I'm fucking tired of it. The very publication that compares diplomatic relations aka spying to mind-control, is exercising the exact same mind-control on a population dumb enough to lap it up. ""Believe us, we only tell the truth, we don't have an agenda"".

*""All sorts of people around the world are questioning what America is doing,"" said Rusbridger. ""The president keeps saying: well we don't spy on our people. [But] that's not much comfort if you are German.""*

Countries have ALWAYS spied on each other, countries have ALWAYS tried to steal industrial and state secrets, this is nothing new. And as the Germans apparently were able to access the same databases when it suited them, what exactly is the problem?

*""The Guardian editor rebuffed criticism from the Obama administration that the newspaper was drip-feeding the stories in order to get the most from them. ""Well, the president has never worked in a newsroom,"" he said.""*

Criticize Obama for his broken promises, but he's bang on with this comment. The Guardian aren't doing this ""for the good of the people"" - they have ONE motive in mind and one only - pageviews / newspaper sales. They've been milking this thing for months, building up to each new ""revelation"" with all the hype and promotion of a damn presidential campaign.

That's a false equivalence though. Have you taken a job where the actual job description requires you to live in one place and work in another on a permanent basis? That is quite different to a job which moves you away from home for a month or two, this is where they have to maintain two homes as they spend 50-50 time between them, for 5 years minimum and most MPs hope for longer.

Many MPs quite literally have to have two homes hundreds of miles apart as they are required both in their constituency and parliament, it's not like other jobs where they send you abroad for 6 months (and any private company will offer flights back home to visit family - keeping people happy is a major component of business) and put you up. On top of that, jobs where people spend large amounts of time away from home are generally well rewarded.

While I agree with many of your other points, kicking it off with something as misleading as that is a bit pointless. I'd rather not have stressed people with shitty personal and family lives running the country to be honest. Paying for someone's kids to visit their parents, who by their job definition have to stay away from home for around 6 months a year, does not seem like a completely unfair proposal.

&gt;They have an office and the staff within it to pay for as well as the expenses of living in a second home?

Office and staff wages are paid for by Parliament, not the MP. See:

&gt;**Office Costs (Previously CORE &amp; GAE)**
This covers the basic costs of having an office: rent,
business rates, utilities and day-to-day running
costs, including office equipment, various services, basic security, and non-political communication costs.
Constituency surgery venue hire is included here too.


&gt;**Staffing Expenditure**
The main elements of this are
the salary, national insurance and pension costs of MPs’ staff.
There is also provision for some bought-in services, pooled research services and the travel and lunch expenses of interns or volunteers.

true,ambivalentatheist,null,null,"The face he is presenting, (and who knows from afar if face presenters present their real faces in any given case), is not one that lacks self awareness, it's just one which is coming at this whole issue from a very different angle to the angle it's being come at by libertarian script kiddies and wannabe bolsheviks. He is starting at the premise, perhaps because it is a premise _his_ (not the guardian online's, even though that is his platform) audience implicitly accept, that the governments of ""the West"" for lack of a better term, are not evil, are trying to do good, but are misguidedly in the process building a machine that if fascists or other nerrdowells took over could then turn to evil. Greenwald attacks from the front ""the government _is_ evil, look what it is doing"". Rusbridger attacks gently from behind ""well of course we all know we're good fine upstanding chaps, but what if bad people managed to take over!"".

Now realistically it's not that great of an argument, what it boils down to is ""we must be powerless because someone might take control of the tools that make us powerful and use it against us"" as though people can't just make their own tools to turn against us if they feel like doing so. It's more nuanced than that because it suggests there is something special about new technology that is particularly corruptible, as if nuclear bombs and other modern wonders were not equally if not more so.

Now that isn't to say there is not a great argument in there, lets say that state level surveillance power in the age of the internet is something particularly corruptible, maybe that is an argument for international treaties being drawn up, agreements being made and so on as to when and how these kind of things can be used. But when we made treaties about nuclear bombs we did so knowing they can kill millions in one stroke, the reality is that internet surveillance is not even on the same kind of page as things like that and it is doubtful that anyone in the international community is going to push for weighty control - because they have little to fear and much to gain and in reality the internet is a bit of a leveller, even bit players and non state actors can brute force their way into doing some cool ops against their opponents - no-one really wants to stop that game because no-one has really suffered any serious consequences. Indeed the main beneficiary of any kind of control are a) maybe non state actors because international control doesn't apply to them BUT it could come coupled with new domestic controls on their actions that make it a much harsher environment for them, indeed this may be a requirement for effective control given the level of outsourcing in that field and b) the USA, and the main effect of this recent hysteria has been to shut down international plans for developing international legal frameworks to cover these issues.

And on a domestic level, people are worried about the suppression of dissent, but the internet is a pretty new thing. It's not like people can't do like the Taliban and (shock horror) talk to people in person about their insurrectionary plans if they want to. The reality is the internet has facilitated not suppressed dissent, surveillance or no surveillance, and it continues to do so. What panic you see is fear of an absolutely tiny step back in response to the giant leap we just took forward.

I'm at risk of outing myself here but I was working on a project to create a simple banking facility back in the very early days of mobile phones (it would have been text based, and this was even before text messaging took off in the late 90s). The company abandoned it as it was absolutely, utterly, without a shred of doubt IMPOSSIBLE to do ANYTHING securely over a mobile phone full stop. Never mind banking. I left this industry then and thought nothing of it, but years later when phones got internet access I was really quite shocked to see little to no warning about how insecure mobiles are, and using them for banking transactions in particular I knew was not possible security-wise. I always wondered why there had been such an about-face regarding mobiles and private data.

I think it's probably down to Pochettino's playing style. Poch likes the team to press very high up the pitch (best example being at Anfield). As one of the attacking mids, but also the one that drifts around the pitch probably the most, Adam does a lot of pressing. He's starting every game because he has the creativity of someone like Gaston, but his pressing is much better. Then, as the last 20 minutes comes round either his pressing or his creativity suffers, therefore another attacking mid will come one (Gaston, Davis, or JWP).

It's a bit frustrating because in quite a few games he's been our main creative threat, and when he goes off we've looked less threatening. We still haven't scored from open play in the league this season so the creative balance of our midfield still isn't quite right. However, the plan worked pretty well against Liverpool. High pressing for 70 minutes, he got the assist for the goal (corner), then JWP came on who is slightly better at keeping the ball, but had the fresh legs to keep pressing, and we held out for the result.

Hope that helps.",0,1380022016,null,0,false,0,ccedyip,t3_1n0qcs,t1_ccedyip,t3_1n0qcs,null,1429360422,12,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,12

Naturally for many reasons he is.

&gt; as he is supposed to hold the government to account.

Not really this one though. He is supposed to edit the guardian, to what end is basically up to the Trust that owns the guardian not your sense of morality. Specifically their aims are:

1. To secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a **quality national newspaper** ... **without party affiliation**; remaining **faithful to its liberal tradition** (note not anti-state, just plain liberal); as a **profit-seeking enterprise managed in an efficient and cost-effective manner**.

2. All other activities should be consistent with the central objective. The Company which the Trust owns should: be managed to ensure profits are available to further the central objective; not invest in activities which conflict with the values and principles of the Trust.

3.The values and principles of the Trust should be upheld throughout the Group. The Trust declares a subsidiary interest in promoting the causes of freedom in the press and liberal journalism, both in Britain and elsewhere.

those values and principles are:

&gt;Among the many well known lines are the assertions that ‘Comment is free, but facts are sacred’, that newspapers have ‘a moral as well as a material existence’ and that ‘the voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard’.

&gt;The essential qualities that Scott believed should form the character of a newspaper are reflected in the contemporary values of the Scott Trust and GMG.

&gt;The qualities he described are: honesty; cleanness (today interpreted as integrity); courage; fairness; and a sense of duty to the reader and the community

Yes, but that couldn't happen without huge consequences to a newly - Independent Scotland.
 It's not like the oil revenues would be 'left over spending money' that could just used to pay off debt. 

Don't forget that **even including a geographic share of oil revenues, Scotland currently spends significantly more than it earns.**

 And that's before Yes! Scotland's post- Independence commitment to; increase public spending, reduce taxes, buy back the Royal Mail, reverse the pension age increase, reverse the bedroom tax, establish a sovereign Oil Fund...oh, and 'eradicate poverty'. Not to mention the fact that our costs to service the huge national debt would be significantly higher (as a new nation with no 'credit history' and no control over the currency we're using) - and not counting the huge one-off costs of actually setting up a new nation and everything that comes with that.

For us (newly Independent Scotland), the numbers don't add up as it is - never mind using all our oil revenue to pay off the National debt.

Er... OK, a little too much like the Biblical analogies you'd hear from right-wing US politicians for my liking, but so be it.

Wait, isn't he blind? And he's dictating that we shouldn't watch porn?

But it gets much worse:

&gt;""I think we have a job in this country, in a civilised, free, open democracy, to protect ourselves from the most bestial activities and from dangers that would undermine a civilised nation.""

&gt;**Drawing a parallel with Germany before the rise of the Nazis, he suggested a loose moral climate had fed the paranoia and fear that had allowed Adolf Hitler to flourish.**

&gt;""In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Berlin came as near as dammit to Sodom and Gomorrah. There was a disintegration of what you might call any kind of social order.

&gt;""People fed on that - they fed people's fears of it. They encouraged their paranoia. They developed hate about people who had differences, who were minorities.

&gt;""There always has had to be some balance, in terms of the freedom of what we want to do, for ourselves and the mutual respect and the duty we owe to each other in a collective society. I think getting it right is the strength of a democracy.""

When one user submits a lot of links in a short period it can drown out other users posts. They will often then decide not to post any more as their links are not getting votes/comments. 

This creates a problem as the subreddit can then become dominated by a few ""power submitters"" who can then act to shape the feel and culture of the subreddit though their posts (eg only posting pro conservative links), this then creates a feedback loop where new users see the majority of the content is biased in one direction and so submit like minded posts.

The second problem is that once your subreddit becomes reliant on these power submitters for content you become neutered in your ability to effectively moderate them. If they turn against you they can cause a witch hunt due to their name recognition in the subreddit, or they can simply stop submitting and so cause your subreddit to suddenly become devoid of new content for several days or weeks until the other users start to become confident in submitting content again.

Finally, it can act to make your subreddit a passive rather than active place.

It echos my own thoughts on how we've been playing. And I am equally as confused as to why. As far as I can see the team is pretty much exactly the same as last year, just had a bit more time to gel, yet Rodgers is setting them up to play a completely different style of football to the way they were playing last year, which is completely baffling and extremely worrying. If you look at our form from when we signed Sturridge and Coutinho, combined with how we played, then you would say add a couple of decent back ups, keep Suarez and have a real go at the top four.

But since the season has started I can only really recall the opening half hour v Stoke and the first half against Villa where we have played anything even remotely like we did at the end of last season. Yet we have the same players. I dont get it. It looks as if Rodgers is trying to set his teams up to grind out results, which is all well and good for the big games, but when you are steam-rolling the lesser teams like we were a couple of months ago, it makes no sense to change the set up of the team.

Last year we were a mid-table team playing lovely expansive football, with lots of promise coming in to this season, its a bit concerning to actually see us *play* like a mid-table team right now.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; A newly independent Scotland, on the other hand, is promising to increase public spending and reduce taxes. It would be economic madness to attempt to do all the things they are committing to (although I suspect most of these promises would soon be broken once the economic reality of Independence sinks in).

As you know, the referendum is not a vote for a particular party.

There are elections in 2016 and who governs Scotland, and what policies they pursue, is something we'll decide then. The public spending you refer to is an SNP commitment, but I'm sure other parties will have other policies. I hope so anyway - sadly none of them are willing to discuss it.

But it's worth considering that independence would almost certainly reduce spending in some areas as well. Both with one-off costs (Scotland's share of renewing Trident will be about £1.6bn), or annually (Scotland's share of the MoD budget is about £3.5bn, from which it receives about £2bn in spending).

Public policy would definitely change. While that may involve public spending commitments it would also bring the ability to address some long-standing problems that are clearly a financial drain. Eg, Scotland spends about £3bn dealing with alcohol abuse in Scotland per year (the same as England and Wales combined), yet is currently unable to use alcohol duty to defray some of those costs.",0,1380029225,null,0,false,0,ccef9v2,t3_1n0scq,t1_ccef9v2,t1_ccef2nb,null,1429359796,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

It worked amazingly well vs. weaker teams, but was disjointed against more quality opposition as the forwards became isolated. In that scenario, Lucas isn't doing as much because longer passes are being played.


In 2013, Gerrard does seem to rotate into the DM slot anyway as we do patient buildup. This means that Lucas is in a more advanced role, even if only for 1-2 possessions at a time. Lucas really offers nothing in that setting - especially not compared to how well Henderson and Allen excel in that role. Gerrard also only had about 4 goals from open play in the league last season - as glorious as they were, that's not really enough justification for having him roam around the box in the middle of buildup. Instead, Gerrard could roam around *late* in build up and offer the same thing (meaning he is the last person to join the attacking buildup, similar to how Lucas will find himself there, but with nothing to do).


Lucas would still have a role, but it may be at the 60' mark when we take off a forward to settle possession. Similarly, Allen could come on for Gerrard to accomplish the same thing. Its not what anyone wants to hear, but the majority of Gerrard's heroics in 2013 have been defensive: pure boss tackle on Welbeck, amazing tracking back on Benteke, 2-3 goal line clearances etc.

true,patrick888,null,null,"&gt; at the same time you've argued time and again that the laborers are all free, happy and well paid. 

I have never denied that the workers ought to be paid more and there are problems with their working conditions. There are huge improvements to be made. I simply disagree that they can be classed as slaves, or that they are worse off in UAE than they would have been at home. I am a huge advocate for improvements to their working conditions and employee rights.

&gt; I lived in both AD and Dubs for a number of years and only due to my employer being who he was i was not arrested for a multitude of ""crimes"", crimes that included documenting a stay in a labor camp, speaking to laborers in the street, and once i was even threatened with being charged as a spy as i was taking pictures of the dead body of a worker who had fallen from a building due to heat exhaustion. 

I have done all those things (apart from taking a photo of a dead body - surely the objections were based around it being disrespectful, no?) and never had a problem. I chat to labourers daily, why would anyone mind?

&gt;  all the rape cases where the woman is charged with premarital sex is generally proof enough for most people that inherently the system is flawed and is unsympathetic at the most inopportune time. 

There have been about 4 cases, which is of course 4 too many, but they get repeated so many times, people think there have been hundreds. Anyway one problem is that the tabloid press report that the women are ""jailed for being raped"", when in actual fact they are jailed because in each case they have confessed to consensual sex outside of marriage (or some other crime) at the same time and the police are obliged to prosecute if they hear a confession. Utterly insensitive, of course, and I agree that the way Dubai police handle rape cases must change.

My own opinion, for what it's worth, is that there are two possibilities. First, the TARDIS scanner cycles back and forth between showing Gallifrey and not showing it, in the same way it showed the positive/negative pregnancy scan of Amy in (I think) Day of the Moon. Both Doctors can see it flipping back and forth, and there is a danger to the timelines because Classic Doctor now has future knowledge that he shouldn't have (namely, the Gallifrey will be destroyed at some point).

Second, the same TARDIS scanner simultaneously shows different things for each Doctor. Young Doctor sees Gallifrey right where it's supposed to be, plain as day, but Old Doctor sees nothing (or floating rubble, or whatever is left of the place). The timelines are safe unless the Doctors specifically have a conversation about their different perceptions... and presumably Old Doctor would know better than to do that.",0,1380032229,null,0,false,0,ccefvza,t3_1mzcqs,t1_ccefvza,t3_1mzcqs,null,1429359509,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

With that in mind, Lamela and Townsend would be better options.

I think there was a decent argument to play him behind sturridge on saturday, but Suarez coming back changes the dynamic completely. Suarez and Gerrard (when playing at the top of midfield) like to get into similar positions but do completely different things with the ball.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"Problem with our current midfield is the personnel. Rodgers wants to play a 4-3-3 with a holding midfielder and 2 central midfielders in front of him. We already have those two central midfielders in Allen and Coutinho/Henderson. 

The problem here are Lucas and Gerrard. While Lucas is a terrific defensive midfielder, he is not adapting well to Rodgers system and tactics. Rodgers wants Lucas to play like Busquets but Lucas can't play like Busquets. I remember when Rodgers first joined the club and Lucas was still sidelined, the staff took him to several games and showed him plenty of videos about how he should play. A pure defensive midfielder is not needed in Rodgers system since the ball is won through pressuring the opposition and not allowing them any space to run in midfield where a typical defensive midfielder is required to disposes the players with the penetrating runs. 
Lucas, however, is more of a destroyer and would blend in perfectly in a team that doesn't emphasize on passing and pressuring so much.

Now onto Gerrard: it seems as if he doesn't have the legs anymore to play a box-to-box midfielder role and just further up the pitch. He also isn't the fastest on the ball but can pick out brilliant passes when left alone. This is not what Rodgers wants in his system. He wants a fast passer, somebody who links the defense and offense in the blink of an eye. Somebody who is compact and finds space and a pass even when put under pressure. We already have that player in Allen. The problem here is that Gerrard is still a greater player but if he can't play in the advanced midfield role i.e. be the third part of a midfield trio of Lucas-Allen-Gerrard, then technically, he has no place in Rodgers system. So Rodgers, for the time being, wants to draw out everything that is still possible with Gerrard by shifting to a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-5-1 where ideally the 3 men in front of Lucas and Gerrard are protecting them and giving Gerrard enough time on the ball. But, as we have seen against Swansea and Southampton, this doesn't work anymore when the opposition presses relentlessly. But Rodgers can't drop Gerrard because... well... it's Gerrard. 

What I wrote may now seem a bit chaotic so TL:DR: Lucas isn't the ideal defensive midfielder that Rodgers wants, Lucas-Gerrard doesn't work under pressure, Lucas-Allen-Gerrard would work if Gerrard were young again, Lucas-Allen-Henderson/Coutinho would be our best bet currently in my opinion but Rodgers won't drop Gerrard.

I'd disagree there.  How would *you* like being accused of rape?  Sure it's more preferable than being raped, but it is still damaging.  Now to the Average Joe it may not hurt much, but imagine being someone in the public eye, or a community leader, or holding a high position in a business -- won't *that* affect your normal, everyday life?

One needs only to look at Michael Jackson to see the devastating effects of false allegations on someone's career (arguably one of the most famous people at the time).  For a more recent example, Michael Le Vell of Coronation Street: 

&gt; In September 2011, Le Vell was accused of a sexual offence, which he strenuously denied. [...] ITV announced that Le Vell would not be appearing in Coronation Street ""pending the outcome of legal proceedings"".

That's *two years* of him being dropped from the show, simply due to a false allegation.

I mean, I do partly agree with you that being raped is a lot more damaging, but being accused of being a rapist hurts, too.  Sure my brother came in and told me: ""Did you hear about that raping bastard in Coronation Street?""  That poor fella's reputation is down the shitter.

&gt; It would make real rape victims more hesitant to report their attacks, and rape is under-reported as it is.

Yeah, I never thought of that, actually, and that's a very good point to've made.

A) won't be relied on defensively and can conervse his energy

B) can help transition from defense to attack

C) creativity will be a big boost in the attack


It helps hendo immensely in that he doesnt have to be all over the pitch all the time covering the flanks and the middle.

lucas will be helped in that he wont have to worry about his holding partner bombing forward and will always have an outlet pass.

when coutinho/allen are available gerrard can go back to playing a bit deeper and we can have a solid rotation of lucas/gerrard/hendo/allen for those 2 spots.  we can't be afraid to sub lucas/gerrard if they're absolutely gassed either.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;It's interest &amp; relevance is highly subjective

Most of my posts generated a good amount of discussion, that'd make me think that they were mostly interesting and relevant.  Why wouldn't mods just let the voting system take care of posts that are either not relevant or not interesting?

&gt;its a small sub so that sounds like flooding from one user.

/r/unitedkingdom has an average of 47 posts per day according to stattit.com, so I can see why it might appear to be ""flooding"" the subreddit.  But consider that to view an average day's worth of /r/unitedkingdom content you only have to change page once.  I was just trying to add more content and discussion to the subreddit.

&gt;If that user genuinely has enough time to find that volume of interesting content i suspect they could be doing more productive things with their time!!

I did sign up for one of the free FutureLearn courses so I have something to do while I've nothing to do at work, but it doesn't start until November 18th.

true,ctc23,lfc68,,"I think a lot of the possession problems fall on Gerrard and Lucas. Like the author says, teams are learning that if you pressure our back line they can force turnovers. It's up to those two to provide outlets when they fall under pressure.

Coutinho is more the type to dribble out of pressure or take a risk with a forward pass, and while those are things we definitely need to find a replacement for, I don't think Luis Alberto for Aspas is the sole solution to our problems. We definitely need to find more stability in build up and possession play if we want to see better results.",0,1380036487,null,0,false,0,cceh6fo,t3_1n0yj3,t1_cceh6fo,t3_1n0yj3,null,1429358907,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6
