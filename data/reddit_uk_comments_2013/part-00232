Fact is we have some world class and [b] young [/b] attacking midfield players.  If KDB cannot get not the team, what makes you think Piazon can?

Piazon is way over rated because he is young, expensive and Brazilian.  Watching his youth matches, totally underwhelm by his skills.  If he was any good, and he will have to be to get a chance to play in our most stacked dept, he would have gone on loan to a better team.

Nevermind the people in front of Piazon, I think there are a few with a better chance behind him.  e.g.  Traore.

In fact, I am willing to bet Piazon wont make it at Chelsea.

Well, fair enough.

It is a bit disappointing that we'll have to wait a while for the next series of *Doctor Who*, but so what? For me, there are simply *other things to do*. There'll be other things to watch. And I don't doubt that Series 8 will be well worth the wait. 

That said, I'm going to enjoy the show returning to a more regular broadcast schedule. I don't doubt that there are conditions and circumstances precluding a more standard, fixed schedule for *Doctor Who*, many of which are beyond the purview of those of us who don't work in the BBC.

There's another reason why I don't mind the lengthy gaps between *Doctor Who* series, and that's because past precedent has shown too much of *Doctor Who* to be a bad thing. I mean, the classic series was on the air for 26 straight years, and it didn't take 26 years for people to simply become tired of the show. True, there were many other mitigating circumstances - changes within the BBC, John Nathan-Turner enacting many sweeping changes, the controversial characterization of Colin Baker's Doctor, industrial action, budget cuts, the growing popularity and better production values of other TV shows, such as *Star Trek: The Next Generation* - but I think one of the key factors in the decline of *Doctor Who* in the late 80s was simply viewer fatigue. Too much of a good thing can still be deleterious.

That's why I strongly liked the BBC resting the show in 2009. *Doctor Who* had gone from strength to strength since its return, and for a show of that size and scope, a brief rest after four very popular years would serve not only to prepare the transition to a new era (and allowed David Tennant to honor his commitments to the Royal Shakespeare Society), but also to give the viewers a chance to catch their breath, and appreciate *Doctor Who* anew when it returned. 

Similarly, if rumors are to be believed and speculation is proved accurate, the last three years of the show have all been leading and building towards the 50th anniversary. Additionally, the BBC and other programming entities are going into *Doctor Who* celebratory overdrive, with retrospective programs, documentaries, interviews, etc. I'm sure it would have been a blast to have had nothing but *Doctor Who* on all the time, but I'm sure that it will be even *more* of a blast to see ""The Day of the Doctor"" after such a long period has elapsed since ""The Name of the Doctor"", than if we simply went from one episode to the other, with only a minimal break. sometimes, less is very much more.

Also, I think the prolonged break until Series 8 serves another purpose. The next two installments of *Doctor Who* will be pivotal moments in the show - one, the celebration of 50 years of the show's history and future; and two, the departure of Matt Smith. As an audience, we will need a break after all that. You can't have peak after peak after peak without a few plateaus. I'm sure we won't be able to wait for the debut of the new doctor in 2014, but that's precisely the point: we're *supposed* to be chomping at the bit. a good performer always knows to make his audience wait, and to make them want more. If you simply give them what they want, they become complacent, burned out, and simply move on to other things that interest them more. That, I believe, is one of the reasons why the classic series fell by the wayside. The staggering of the last few years of broadcast schedules have been frustrated, undeniably, but I believe that they were done out of necessity, and to preserve some of the novelty and hype. Simply rolling out predictable scheduling would have simply made people become bored with the show. As it is now, the wait is rabid, and I'll wager you that audience numbers for the next three episodes - ""The Day of the Doctor"", the Christmas special and the opening episode of series 8 - will be through the roof. Not simply because these will be big episodes within the show itself, but because we, as the audience, will be eagerly looking forward to them.

I have to say, that wasn't tiresome in the least. A **good discussion** on *Doctor Who* is always a treat. This is a very unique show were talking about, one that literally spans generations, and one on the cusp of an event that most TV shows can't even imagine.. To be able to talk about the show in general in such detail and length is not something that we can do for other TV shows. In some ways, *Doctor Who* is a vast Rorschach, ultimately telling us more about ourselves than simple science fantasy stories. 

So, yes, **this was very edifying**. I've always fancied myself a bit of a scholar on *Doctor Who*. True, it doesn't really have any practical applications, and I don't think it would ever pay the bills, but given the medium, it's hard for me to wax on a topic on which I feel somewhat qualified. I've been following the show for a long time, and I've read many things about the production, creation and conceptualizations of the respective eras of *Doctor Who*, but it's rare to find myself in a situation that calls for more than a simple question and answer format. It's quite possible that the impending celebration of the show's 50th anniversary brings out the *Doctor Who* academic in me. As I said, I've been watching the classic series a lot, and I have the trivia event in a couple of weeks, so I am especially keyed into all things *Doctor Who* right now, more so than usual. The opportunity to flex my *Doctor Who* muscles, as it were, was quite rewarding. I highly doubt anyone will read all this, especially so deep into the thread, but I have to admit, this was a **fascinating tangent**, and a **very entertaining exercise** in rhetoric.

However, I think that sleeping with post pubescent people who have thrown themselves at you is very different from coercing pre pubescent children to have sex with you. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand that the law needs to have an arbitrary line drawn and that knowingly crossing that line from a much older age is not ideal by any means. 

It is one of those examples of law being largely divorced from morality. After all, a 16 year old having sex with a 15 year old consensually is illegal. There are some 16 year olds who are still pre pubescent. There are others who are fully developed physically. There are 16 year olds who have a child's mindset and there are 16 year olds who have more mature mindsets than many adults.

In moral terms it is the individuals that are having sex that are important, rather than the arbitrary line that is drawn by the state. 

That being said, if you are under 25, I am not having sex with you.  ",0,1383383814,null,0,false,0,cd50jqv,t3_1ppg6s,t1_cd50jqv,t1_cd509ee,null,1428890570,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Lloris
Walker-Daws-Vlad-Vert

I've put a / for Sandro and Dembele because they're both in good form but their place in the team depends on opposition.


By the end of the year I expect this to be our best XI

Lloris
Walker-Daws-Vert-Rose
Sandro/Dembele-Paulinho 
Lamela-Eriksen-Townsend
Soldado

I don't expect a huge deal of change, but as Eriksen and Lamela find their feet they'll more than likely make their way into the team, of course it also depends on the performances of players like Lennon, Chandli, Holtby and Siggy, and Capoue in the midfield could displace Sandro/Dembele.

F1 Hybrids are important because the children plants are incredibly consistent with each other, which is very important in large-scale farming.

The fact that F1s between different species tend to be sterile is more a convenient side effect. If seed producers were to move away from F1s, we would have *very* different produce than what we are used to, and you wouldn't have rows and rows of identical cabbages and carrots.

Farmers also don't necessarily *want* a plant that seeds itself. With a lot of crops, the yield can be ruined if the crop goes to seed.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"Sounds like a good arguement FOR genetically modified crops. The problem with traditional selective breeding is it takes a shit ton of time to whittle out the undesirable traits of crops. It's literally down to chance that you will end up with what you want, so even with perfect luck you're talking at least a few generations of crops before you have the perfect specimen.

With genetic modification it's just a question of finding the right gene, once you find it then there's a good chance that you will be able to put that gene in to a genetically diverse population. And since the vast majority of species share a significant amount of genetic material, there's a good chance that you can use said gene with any closely (and perhaps distantly) related crops.

Instead of having 1 banana tree, you'd potentially have dozens on the grounds that after finding the genes you like you can just repeat the process tens, hundreds, thousands of times and create an extremely diverse population.

Will companies create such genetic variety of their own volition, probably not, creating more than a single crop will cost more time and money doing R&amp;D and thus not making profits. Does that mean that legislation cannot be put in place regarding only accepting GM products from sustainable sources (i.e. diverse crops thus less liability that the place we're importing from will have similar issues to the banana virus).",0,1383392593,null,0,false,0,cd51imy,t3_1ppw3y,t1_cd51imy,t1_cd50wp3,null,1428890046,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; Why would they vote for another party that also wanted to go to war. That would make no sense as a form of protest.

But if feeling were that strong, a party would have represented it. There's no such thing as a politican that doesn't capitalise on public feeling.

&gt;What's China got to do with anything?

They're trying a system that's more akin to what you're suggesting. But rather than address or change their system's problems, regardless of corruption, they're parading party officials in court and making examples of them (whether guilty or not) to appease the population (or so they hope). Would they not be exploring your suggestion, as it would be easier to migrate to than for, say, us?

&gt;Which means what exactly? A country doesn't have needs, nor wants. 

Oh please. You may as well ask what someone means by 'what is best for the family' and then complain that each member is unique. I'm not going to give details on prioritising and other obvious issues. You give an example of Aberdeen/ London, but then we're back to everyone generally voting for themselves and the same result happening - but worse, without the amount of information a minister has to make use of (unless you expect every individual to take on board the same amount of information for every decision as a minister does, which then takes us back to people not wanting to do this).

&gt;Those financial services pretty much brought the global economy to ruin and what have been the consequences for their owners? Basically, nothing.

That doesn't really make any difference (and there have been lots of consequences for lots of owners, unless you don't count shareholders as owners). And yes, a lot of that is from London, but so what? You've got to provide an industry for other areas to concentrate on if you want to avoid finance (or at least keep it to London) - and the Goverment cannot just create industries...which is what you'd need in place already for any socialism idea (assuming people wanted it) to be implemented. Industry can be encouraged, but that's a different ball game.

&gt; So why not cut out the councillor who could quite easily reject the idea because his rich mate paid him a bribe to do so?

Most MP's don't do this. It's funny - when someone on reddit mentions a family-of-ten on the dole, it's immediately dismissed as a tiny percentage and therefore not representative of the whole...but politicians and the police? Well.....can you give figures of how many MP's/ Police have taken illegal bribes as a percentage of the whole, or done somethign similarly illegal? (Taking the piss on their expenses isn't really large-scale enough).

&gt;No, the councillor basically tells workers to implement the idea.

I have to say, I have some insider knowledge here because I currently work with councillors and while I don't really have any affinity or antagonism towards them, that statement is akin to saying that IT bods have an easy job because they 'simply type stuff and it works.'

&gt;How can there be any real change from them though, if they refuse to let go of these systems which are failing society so badly?

I think it's a case of evolution rather than an abrupt change - for example, I'd be happier if lobbying was more restricted in terms of what a councillor is actually allowed to do in the name of a corporation once it's established that they're being lobbied. The corps would still get to lobby, but we wouldn't have to worry so much about the MP then doing stuff on their behalf to the detriment of their constituents. There's obviously a lot more to it than that, but remember the Government is currently trying to *encourage* business, and there are plenty of other countries offering good incentives to base there, which is why some of our tax loopholes have become so outrageous.

But how do we create more industry? Many other countries in the world don't have to worry about pesky stuff like employment rights (or, at least, to the level we do) and can therefore manufacture at rates we can't possibly hope to match...and this won't change until either we accept lower wages, or the other countries are forced to raise theirs.

&gt;Forced by capitalists who have shaped the economy in order to exploit other peoples labour.

Nothing that hasn't been going on for many, many years. And as long as people's living standards/ lifespans keep going up, nobody overall is going to complain.

&gt;Forced by capitalists who brought the global economy crashing down. 

Again, this has happened several times before, and most people survivied. If you want a revolution, this isn't going to be it.

&gt;Forced by capitalists who take MPs aboard their yachts and then get fascist, corporate friendly laws passed.

And I read about a family-of-ten on benefits the other day. It's a disgrace. :-)

That was two comments ago, before you decided you weren't going to.

&gt;I'm going to just assume they are all scum.

Well, I say a family-of-ten on benefits in the paper the other day, so I'm just going to assume that they're all scrougers. See how well that attitude works out?

&gt;Since one bad apple does indeed spoil the whole bunch. 

So, following that logic, the entire country are criminals. What was that you were saying about talking rubbish?

&gt;Rotten crop right there. 

Suggesting they aren't all rotten is not the same as suggesting none of them are.

&gt;I'm curious how you think in a police force that you imagine, such a thing could happen.

Several ways, I imagine. They could have been prompted, they could have just decided they didn't like him (so lets fuck him over, etc.). But that's why we go twice as strong on the police that *do* go bad as regular people - they've been given a position of trust and authority, and so they're going to automatically be in more trouble for abusing that.

&gt; If I worked in an honest police force I'd never even suggest such action for fear of being reported and sacked.

I think that's how it works generally - unless you can provide statistics to show it's the norm.

&gt;No, I was pointing out you were making a rather silly comparison. 

Avoiding the larger point it is, then.

I have little reason to be sure that Piazon is an inferior player to someone like KdB. At around Piazon's age, Mata was deemed not good enough for Madrid and sent to Valencia, who were at that point a mid table team. 

Last year they had so much faith in Piazon that they sent him on loan to a Champions League club. That did turn out less than ideal, so this year he is somewhere that the club has more control. 

I would put Bertrand Traore in exactly the same boat. They have both looked highly talented when I have seen them play, but it will be a few years before anyone can know anything about them for sure.

The author's themselves acknowledge this, and it is clear that there is far more at work here than just the comparison between home ownership and unemployment rates. Owning a home does indeed put people off from looking further afield for a job unless they are being paid enough to buy another house or rent a place at the same time as owning a place, but the same can also be applied to couples where one partner already has a job, or other similar familial concerns. Furthermore it is clear that there are several other factors at play in unemployment that have a much more meaningful impact that whether or not you own your own home. he uses Germany and Switzerland as counterpoints to Spain, but fails to mention that those countries economies are based upon entirely different things.

Plotting these and just trying to find a linear trend gives an R^2 value of 0.112 i.e. there isn't even a correlation worth talking about. R^2 values range from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation).

Hell, you don't even need to go that far ... just looking at exceptions like Singapore with 90.1% home ownership and a mere 1.9% unemployment (the lowest in the table) and Macedonia with 95% home ownership and a massive 28.8% unemployment (the highest in the table excepting Nepal) debunks the whole thing.

Unemployment and Home Ownership are obviously both affected by government policy and financial ~~status~~ ""health"" of the country as a whole. That does NOT mean to say Unemployment and Home Ownership demonstrate a cause-effect relationship in themselves.

I wouldn't be happy with ""any government"" deciding, but I do think these decisions should be taken by parliament in accordance with democratic means, as I think most policy decisions should be taken. Will those decisions always be right? No. But I think it is a better way to run society than any alternative.

I also reject the idea that men should not be involved in the abortion debate. Just as I think civilians should be able to have input into military matters and non-victims of crime should be able to have input into criminal justice matters. 

As I mentioned in my post, I am pro-choice. But I do think us pro-choicers need to appreciate where the other side is coming from. If you genuinely believe the unborn is a human person, then clearly the issue is much more complex than just about ""women's bodies"". It is a difficult issue I believe when personhood begins: some would say conception, some would say birth, and many would say at some point in the middle, due to issues of sentience, viability etc. My personal view is when sentience becomes possible, after activity begins in the cerebral cortex, and that's where I'd argue for abortion to be allowed before and banned afterwards. However, if a society, through its democratic institutions, decides that an unborn child deserve rights and protections before that stage, I think it's entirely legitimate for them to decide to do that. 

On this matter, as with many others, I think people need to acknowledge the arguments of the other side and deal with them. The sort of politics that just states one's own way of looking at it ever more loudly, and castigating the other side as idiotic, immoral etc is very unhelpful.

The man can score from some of the most impossible angles but I've yet to see him create his own chances in his entire time in La Liga, and his shots are not that powerful. Either we utilize our creative talent to unlock Soldado, find him a striking partner much in the same way of Suarez and Sturridge, or continue this inefficient strategy of having every midfielder having a speculative crack at goal from a distance. 

It's nice to have options from Siggy, Lennon, Townsend, Eriksen, Chadli (when he finds his form) and Lamela (also when he finds his form), but our low scoring numbers speak for themselves. We need to have Soldado scoring or we will falter against the big teams.

Yes it does. You said the result of making this comment offline would be assault, which you agree is unjust. People should be free from unjust consequences to their actions.

&gt; Just because they're said online doesn't mean that they have any less impact than if they were said in person.

Being called a ""cunt"" on here by a stranger is less threatening than being called a ""cunt"" by a stranger in the real world.

However, I do agree that online bullying can be horrific and I support police intervention where death threats, threatening behaviour or harrassment is being made online.

&gt; If you antagonise someone who's threatening you with a knife, you're going to get stabbed.

I shouldn't be threatened by a knife wielding maniac in the first place.

&gt; That's the point, for every other aspect of society there are consequences to our actions **(whether just or unjust)**, why should it be any different online?

Well many online actions which people would consider morally reprehensible do have consequences.

You cannot claim there should be unjust consequences for people. It makes no sense. You are literally asking why people should have the freedom to say/do things that others dislike (despite being well within the law to do so).",0,1383408814,null,0,false,0,cd552rb,t3_1pqw5m,t1_cd552rb,t1_cd54jsh,null,1428888385,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Assuming we line up as we did vs. WBA and they line up as they usually do (4-2-3-1) the pitch should look something like [this.](http://gyazo.com/f0a54df3a1c53fd491fc6cb9fb470b9f.png)

With these two lineups the game will become essentially 8 1v1 battles with 2 free men a side. Ours being Sakho and Toure in defence (who'll help cope with Ozil and Giroud), theirs being Gibbs and Sagna.

This is important because the weakness of 3-5-2 is that you can be overloaded on the wings when the opposition push their fullbacks forwards.

However it's not as simple as Arsenal being able to dominate us by throwing their fullback forwards. If they do that the game will look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/8eczDUk.png), leaving Suarez and Sturridge 2v2 with Mertesacker and Koscielny. I think we know who wins there.

Therefore Arsenal have to be smart about it to exploit this weakness. If they were to attack with just Sagna for example, then Cissokho can push up into midfield to pressure him and Sakho can come across to the left back position to cover, making the pitch look like [this](http://gyazo.com/e77a8985668866379c055819d460b508.png). 

If we were using 3-4-1-2, then Arsenal would then be able to switch it and exploit the space left in front of Johnson. However, since we changed to a midfield with Lucas behind Gerrard and Henderson, we cover the pitch better and they could cover this space whilst we recover our shape. 

Tl;dr: Arsenal will struggle to exploit their extra men outwide without exposing themselves to Sturridge and Suarez on the counter. Therefore the key to the game will be in who wins their 1v1 battles (ie is our midfield mobile enough, can Lucas defend zonally against Giroud and Ozil etc) rather than through differences in the two systems.",0,1383409116,null,0,false,0,cd55673,t3_1pr35o,t1_cd55673,t3_1pr35o,null,1428888341,43,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,43

The brainwashing wasn't easily reversed - she lived an entire life with Amy, who loved the Doctor (as opposed to the unknown amount of time she was with the Silence, in which they taught her to hate the Doctor). She clearly developed mixed feelings, and then she met the Doctor himself.

Only once or twice do they say it's back to front, they almost always say it's  just in the wrong order. River never said the Doctor's first kiss was River's last (that I can remember). When she got upset after realizing that it was the Doctor's first time kissing her, I interpreted it as her realizing that they could never truly share a moment because they were both at such different times in their relationship.

The Doctor also breaks out and into places all the time. Why can't River? They do eventually pardon her when the Doctor tries to remove himself from history, but it's not like he's removing himself from reality - there was a point at which she killed him, and then records of him were erased.

Unless you've created the .torrent, or it's ridiculously popular, with a tonne of seeds, odds are that if you download, for example Season 1 of Breaking Bad, you're subsequently going to upload at least a very small part of it back - as you continue to download the blocks you need, you're uploading the blocks you already have to other users.

If it's an ""official"" torrent; say for example a song / piece of software, that was originally uploaded by the copyright holder, with the intent of distributing it for free, via BitTorrent, then it doesn't really matter. If anything seeding the torrent should be encouraged.

true,bebobobo,null,null,"By being exposed to the vortex for billions of years is how they became time lords. If just being conceived in the vortex makes a Time Lord then literally anyone can do it and become a Time Lord because time travel is possible without a Tardis. 

The universe was reset. Amy grew up with her parents and never met the Doctor and the Doctor never even existed even to Amy. The only way River existed was because of the Doctor traveling with Amy. The reason why Amy ended up remembering the Doctor was because River gave her the Tardis journal which should not of been possible.

She hated the Doctor the moment she started interacting with him. Her parents were dying and the only person that could save them was the Doctor and River was just letting them die. She doesn't even change her mind in attempt to save her parents, she changes her mind to save the Doctor solely because of what was whispered to her. 

Amy explicitly states that their timelines are back to front and when the Doctor kisses River for the first time she states that it was her last kiss from the Doctor. 

River is suppose to be in a maximum security prison so breaking out all the time and then willingly going back in makes absolutely no sense. Also there was literally no point to River spending time in prison if the Doctor was just able to erase himself from history &amp; records. It's even more unbelievable that she spends time in prison &amp; then the prison looks into the records and decides that the person they sentenced her for killing never existed so they just let her go. 

River was about to strike the Doctor and then he grabbed her arm and stopped her. This is after we have seen things walk through her; if she was really a hologram then her arm should have passed through the Doctor's hand. Not to mention that she is supposed to be mindlinked to Clara only, but then again that doesn't make sense either.

This I very strongly disagree with. People should be able to criticize laws they do not agree with. 

On a personal level, this saddens me as another situation where religion is holding back common sense. I draw this as a parallel to homosexuality in Pakistan (my home country) being illegal for religious reasons. Although it's even more sad that Ireland is a developed country whereas Pakistan is still pretty backwards. I should have the ability to criticize the Pakistani's government's laws. People in the UK should have the ability to criticize Ireland's laws. IMO, there's absolutely no reason why ""Ireland should choose for itself what its abortion laws are without being hectored by the British government foreign charities"".

The Second World war cost us our colonies, our Empire, our prestige, our pride. Look at the UK today, if you wave a flag you're a racist. We aren't taught about the glorious Empire in schools, instead we learn about medicine through time and the only time the Empire is mentioned is during Black History Month, which focuses wholly on the negative things we did. If we had kept the colonies and remained an Imperial power, this would not be the case.

We had ships enough to fight a large Imperial power (Nazi Germany), we had men left over from conscription, and I'm sure that if we conceded our portion of Germany over to the Yanks then they would have given us the money to keep India. We COULD have held it. India was the big spark that started other independence movements, if we had kept India we wouldn't have lost the rest, and if they DID revolt then India was making us enough money to fund ventures to put down the revolters! 

Giving up India was one of the most monumental mistakes this country's government has ever made.

[This song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXpplGmA9Tc) and [this little ditty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5t842UuBlw) are the big ones to know. 

The nickname ""The Toffees"" probably stems from a toffee shop in Everton village from back when Everton moved to Goodison Park. Nowadays, Everton mints are thrown into the crowd by a Toffee Lady. 

We're also known as ""The School of Science"" because of our traditionally technical and beautiful style of play. 

Dixie Dean set the record for most goals in a season in 1927-28, a record which still stands today.

Our club motto is ""Nil Satis Nisi Optimum,"" which means ""Nothing but the best is good enough."" Supporters care quite a bit about it, and there was a great deal of controversy when it didn't appear on the badge this year. We often abbreviate it as NSNO, and use it as a sign-off on message boards and such.

*“I’d break every bone in my body for any club I play for but I’d die for Everton.”* - Dave Hickson. Just about sums up how much passion people feel for our club.

In most cases, it's infringing in the course of business that's a criminal offence. However, communicating a work to the public can be a crime even outside business. This is only if the copyright holder has been prejudiced and the accused person knew or should have known that that the work was copyrighted.

Otherwise, the copyright holder can sue the person or people who infringe their copyright. They can sue for any relief that they could get if someone breached another property right. That includes an injunction/interdict to stop them and damages. Damages are recompense for loss, so are based on the loss caused by the infringement.

The only reason Ivanovic wasn't in that starting XI was because he was also selected a lot at centre back, so arguably he would be the favoured to play. 
I agree with most of the comments that Lampard's passing has gone downhill. It is compounded when he is playing together with Ramires, who also struggles to make simple passes at times.

[Some companies have developed methods of recording IP addresses which connect to any particular BitTorrent swarm](http://torrentfreak.com/riaa-mpaa-copyright-warnings-facts-and-fiction-090328/). This works by connecting to the swarm, and simply seeing which IPs connect to you. These IP addresses, along with timestamps and the cooperation of ISPs, can be used to identify the account holder for any particular connection to the Internet.

Technically speaking, they can't be used to identify a human being. IPv4 addresses usually only identify a connection. So if you have 4 people in a house, it wouldn't be possible to know who did it with this information only.

IP**v6** addresses, in contrast to v4 ones, are sometimes device-specific, meaning all the devices in your house have their own IPv6 address (there is no NAT).

edit: The ability for people to see IPs of a torrent swarm can be combatted by using a VPN or an anonymisation service like I2P (I2P has its own self-contained BitTorrent network). Some people may be interested in doing this for purely privacy reasons, not just circumvention of the law.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Maths graduate here and I agree with you entirely.

My university Maths exams often start with ""Define X"" or "" State X Theorem"". There's a reason for that and that reason is that you can't make any progress if you have to keep looking things up all the time.

&gt; The first year of a Maths course is essentially discarding most stuff you learned at GCSE and A-level.

What?

&gt; There is already far too much focus on simply recalling formulae in school maths and the suggestion to increase this is both irresponsible and foolish. Is it better to be able to simply recall formulae and algorithms for a few exams before forgetting it as you'll never use it again? Or, is it better to teach children critical thinking skills which they'll be able to use for problem solving in later life? I understand why teachers teach maths in this way because it does achieve better grades but we end up with less capable people.

You've misidentified the problem. The problem is that the applications of the formulae in exams are too simple and that isn't solved by providing students with a comprehensive formula booklet (or made worse by taking it away).

Why the hell is agger not playing. The other CBs are doing ok but you just can't drop your clearly best CB.

Enrique is better than Cissokho, don't know why he's not in the team.

true,junnies,null,null,"The difference between us and Arsenal today was really clear. They have a world-class midfield whilst we have a decent one. I don't like to say this but Lucas hasn't been good enough for us this season and he was near-useless against Arsenal. Gerrard isn't nearly athletic enough but he does consistently offer game-winning quality in terms of ball distribution. Henderson/Coutinho are both still too raw; one is technically deficient and the other lacks physicality.

Our chances in top 4 may lie in purchasing a truly top-class defensive midfielder with the necessary athleticism to compete. 

That said, i'm pleased with Brendan Rodger's change in tactics and substitutions. On hindsight, we shouldn't have attempted 3-5-2 without Johnson/Enrique and we probably should have packed the midfield against Arsenal to squash out space and time. Rodgers picked up on that in the second half but unfortunately it was too little too late. 

I believe Arsenal's first team is truly world-class. Their back four snuffed out the SAS whilst Giroud has moulded his playstyle to fit perfectly into Arsenal's. Its no shame losing to them, but hopefully we'll pick up on the main lesson of the game which is that we need a better midfield.

We lost away to the league leaders, and i havent seen arsenal play that well for a while. They're deserved leaders at the moment. We actually didnt play too poorly we had a few chances here and there and both their goals required a touch of class from their goal scorers.

Most of our players were actually pretty good, you cant expect to be making the kinda clear cut chances that we did last week against a side like Arsenal. You only really get one or two half chances and neither Suarez/Sturridge could do much today (not to mention a few poor final balls/crosses). Mertesacker and Koz were absolutely boss today.

I hate complaining about formations being wrong in hindsight. But yes it seemed that the moment we lost Johnson there should have been a change in formation. 3-5-2 requires damn good wingbacks and Cissoko and Flanagan are not. Flanagan actually did pretty well (1 mistake near the end of the first half) some good hustle and runs, but his finish at the other end of the pitch was not up to scratch. Cissokho, well he had a shocker, and thats 2 goals now where some lazy defending has cost us. Also rubbish in attack, cant wait for Enrique to get back. The defence is not something you should be using your subs on unless there is an injury, its an admittance that you picked poorly and you lose any tactical changes you could make by subbing a mid or a forward. I think Hendo ended up as our right back at the end (mind you he had some amazing crosses coming in at the end of the game).

Rodgers was betting that a system that was working for both defensive discipline and getting the best out of the strikers would outplay the midfield maestros that are Arsenal. We definitely lost that bet. The Gunners were spectacular for parts of that game.

Honestly tho, equal 2nd after 10 games. I would have taken that at the beginning of the situation. We'll regroup for Fulham at Home, which should be much easier. Hopefully Cissokho doesnt get another game and  Agger gets back in (for Toure maybe... he had his 1st poor game).",0,1383421999,null,0,false,0,cd59jhw,t3_1prjh1,t1_cd59jhw,t3_1prjh1,null,1428886230,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I would think the fact that this isn't working very well would be obvious due to not having a clean sheet in the last seven premier league games, the majority of which were played with that formation. It takes away a midfielder leaving a massive gap between midfield and strikers. The wing back position is, I believe, intended to push the pace on the wings in order to get in behind the defense and play dangerous crosses in behind. That hasn't been overly lucrative looking at the style of most of Liverpool's recent goals. Also taking into account that I don't think Toure has been quite up to snuff of late and doesn't necessarily add much to the center that Skrtel and Sakho couldn't do themselves I don't see a point in unceremoniously cramming all three into the middle.

Just an extra point, I like the halftime substitution but pushing arguably the best center back in the squad out onto the left and leaving in Flanagan who hasn't played a premier league game in 18 Months seems like a mistake. Especially compounded by the fact that Toure's second half was poor. Of the two, neither of which was having an impressive game, I would like to see that a player with something around 100 top level games under his belt in the last 4 or 5 years would be utilized instead of a player with 12 total premier league appearances.

The midfield is indeed a problem but I honestly believe that at least partially comes down to the fact the the 3-5-2 with the available midfield players leaves too large a gap, both literally and creatively, for the opposing midfield to work with

tl;dr: Not a great performance, I think 3-5-2 is wrong.

Just because the goal doesn't directly come from an obvious failing of the back three doesn't mean it doesn't have an effect. So for example having three big strong center backs would generally be considered a perk on set pieces over another smaller midfield but that hasn't happened. Cabaye's long range effort was a wonderful shot but is there not some question in the fact that he's running one on one with a center back with no midfield cover? with only Lucas being able to actually devote to defensive duties it leaves a gap where someone like Cabaye or Ramsey will pounce. I think it's important to note that playing with three center backs the way Liverpool have doesn't really do much more than split the defensive duty generally split between two players between two leaving the wings as vulnerable as they would be with two in the middle.

Abortion does not kill babies. Abortion is termination *before* the embryo would be able to live outside the womb. A ten week old embryo is incapable of doing pretty much any of the processes necessary for life in the world, if it were born it would die instantly. The mother is ceasing its development. before it becomes a viable human.

&gt;whim: a sudden desire or change of mind, especially one that is unusual or unexplained

Abortion is not a decision taken lightly by many (possibly any) women, and it is not unexplainable at all. If you ask any woman who's had an abortion, I'm sure they would be able to give you multiple reasons why they did it, some of which could be not wanting to put another child into the care system, not having the means to raise it themselves, the embryo having an already-diagnosed illness that would result in extremely poor quality of life and early mortality, it being conceived through rape and a lot more.

Word.

I think none of us expected Cissokho to dominate in the Premiership, but I have to say I'm disappointed that we don't get more out of his speed and strength. Anyhoo, today we basically played a wide formation against a compact Arsenal which is bound to cause us trouble, especially when our wide men (Ciss and Flanno) are the weakest players on the field. Makes it impossible for us to keep possession where we want it.

I think Rodgers chose to stick with formation despite available manpower today, which was a mistake. If your current gameplan is reliant on Flanno and Ciss, you should rethink. Either Moses and Hendo out wide if you insist on 3-5-2, or a more traditional back four with Kolo and Agger, and then Hendo and Cou on the flanks.",0,1383425654,null,0,1383426649,0,cd5atd3,t3_1prjh1,t1_cd5atd3,t1_cd5al6r,null,1428885636,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Cissokho somehow lets Sagna beat him to the ball when his only job was to track his run. Skrtel and Toure's positioning is fine to deal with Giroud but they're taken out the game as the ball is pulled back behind them. Then you have to question why Lucas and Flanagan aren't reaching the loose ball first when they've been running back for 40 yards clearly behind Cazorla and Ozil (I think it's him at least). Skrtel does his best to get in the way of the rebound but you can't blame him, it was luck of the rebound that the ball came to Cazorla after hitting the post. You can't blame Sakho either when he's coming back, when you get out of position you cover someone else's position until you regain the ball or it goes out, as there's nobody goalside of him you can't expect him to sprint back to get back into the defensive line.

* Take bus number 146 from Bromley South station to Downe. There is a bus every hour either way, it takes about 25 minutes, and the last bus is after 11pm.

Bromley South is in zone 5, and the 146 is a London bus route, so you can use your Oyster card or Travelcard. Make sure you don't miss your stop, and if you're using Oyster, don't forget to make sure you touch in and out at the train stations, even if the gates are open!

One final word of warning: on weekends, some railways and Tube lines are often closed for repair/improvement work.

Unpopular though this may be, yes. Of course the semen comes from the chap, and of course the views and wishes of all involved should be heard, but I still have to defend a woman's right to do what SHE wants in the end. After all, she's in for 9 months of gestation and a baby she possibly doesn't want.

&gt;Do you not think that my partner's heath and wellbeing (and that of any potential child) would not be of the utmost importance to me?

And I LOVE that YOU think that way - it's unlikely that my rabid feminism would be directed at you anyway. You're clearly not the sort of person to up and go because you just can't cope. The reason I say it's a women's issue is because of the times when it's become HER problem far outweigh the times when it's a committed (or even casual) relationship, and it's HER that can't cope, but HE wants a child.

And you're right, it's not SOLELY a women's issue. There are SO many variables to take into consideration - very few of which, I believe, are anything to do with a government. My take on it is rather like a relationship - one person's happy as a pig in shit, but the other one wants out. Is that relationship going to survive? Don't think so. Does the government care? Nope. Should they legislate so that the happy person can continue to be happy while the unhappy one must soldier on and accept their fate? Not any more. I'm sorry, that's a very simplistic simile.

true,naturenet,eng-wight,Isle of Wight,"Local authority parks manager here. 

There are two things here that are relevant. The first is that people love suing councils. They seriously do. And when they win damages and/or costs, that money doesn't come from some insurance fund (well, for this sort of claim not usually). It actually comes from the funds that would otherwise be used to provide services. Here are some real examples that I can assure you are all too typical. http://childinjuries.co.uk/category/playground-accidents/

The second is that there are no longer any staff left to check parks and provide professional opinions on things like tree safety. They have almost all been made redundant or simply left. And by almost all, I mean that - in one authority I am aware of, the professional permanent parks department is down to one part-time officer for an entire county. The rest of the work is undertaken by external contractors, or in many cases is no longer undertaken. You can imagine how much time that gives that officer to give individual attention to any one site.

The combination of these two factors means that a cautious approach is essential, but it's difficult to actually deliver without the means to do so. 

My imaginary scenario to explain OP's case is that for lack of anybody qualified to say the park is safe, the contractors can only cover their backs and wait until somebody gets around to looking at it - meanwhile that person is already being asked to look at another 50 sites all around the area, hence the delay.",0,1383432520,null,0,false,0,cd5d59w,t3_1prb2p,t1_cd5d59w,t3_1prb2p,null,1428884548,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31

Absolutely, I agree with you 100%. It just seemed like there was a suggestion that if you are a male, then it's not a pressing issue and that it should be of no concern to a male.

&gt; The reason I say it's a women's issue is because of the times when it's become HER problem far outweigh the times when it's a committed (or even casual) relationship, and it's HER that can't cope, but HE wants a child

*nods*

&gt; And you're right, it's not SOLELY a women's issue. There are SO many variables to take into consideration - very few of which, I believe, are anything to do with a government. My take on it is rather like a relationship - one person's happy as a pig in shit, but the other one wants out. Is that relationship going to survive? Don't think so. Does the government care? Nope. Should they legislate so that the happy person can continue to be happy while the unhappy one must soldier on and accept their fate? Not any more. I'm sorry, that's a very simplistic simile.

Woah, that's not what I'm suggesting either, not for a second.

I'm just saying that men are affected by unwanted pregnancy too, and the emotional impact on the man is every bit as real and hurtful as it is for the woman.

NOBODY should be telling a woman what she can and cannot do with her body and that includes the father of the foetus; I'm just saying that men are affected too, even if they don't have a say in the eventual outcome.",0,1383433071,null,0,false,0,cd5dbxg,t3_1pqqah,t1_cd5dbxg,t1_cd5d0d3,null,1428884463,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Made some excellent tackles, and was very strong in the air.  Didn't fuck up with the ball too much, unless my memory is off.

A 6 for Coutinho is also too low.  What the hell guys?  He came in and really made no mistakes besides that poorly conceived 35-yard shot.  He sent out a number of threatening balls that Suarridge were half a yard off of a scoring chance from.

5.5 for Flanno is harsh.  Thought he did his job well.

Everton are in between. They are good enough to attack us and give us a game, but on paper we are better than them. They won't be content to park the bus, and the more aggressive and open playstyle might give us the space we need to actually work our attacks.

All people saying it ""hadn't taken place yet"", are *half*-right, *depending*. There have actually been **two** Time Wars. The new series just refuses to admit the first one actually ""happened"". One may have undone the other.

Nobody knows, the people who wrote each of the Wars don't care enough to talk to the other.

Then again, the new series also has the Doctor losing at least 53 years of his life (the Seventh Doctor started out 953 years old, not 900); and the story of the ""human Doctor"" (*Human Nature*) as played by the Tenth was [originally a book for the **Seventh** Doctor](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na38.htm). And Sarah Jane met the Eighth Doctor before meeting the Tenth. And Gallifrey was **destroyed** before it was ""locked away in a time bubble"", with Rassilon forever dead and entombed, not come-back-to-run-the-War.

You really want to know the rest?

Backstory:

After the Classic series ended on TV in 1989, it continued in book, Audio-play and comic forms.

The first series of books were published by Virgin; then they lost the licence and it went to the BBC books range.

The telemovie came out in 1996, introducing the Eighth Doctor (as played by Paul McGann; there's some photo evidence to suggest that maybe John Hurt is playing an older Eighth Doctor); and the BBC books continued with him.

The Eighth Doctor's run, [as contributed to by the author Lawrence Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_War), introduced (lots, but specially) two new ideas:

1) the idea of a new bunch of ""baddies"" (post-modern ""baddies"", not **actually** *evil*) called ""Faction Paradox"". The Doctor stumbled onto an auction of a super-weapon to a bunch of aliens (including Daleks). [The super-weapon? Happened to be his own, final **corpse**](http://www.drwhoguide.com/whobbc06.htm).

2) A Time War. And a big one. The Daleks had nothing to do with it, the idea of the Daleks being a part of the War was a *joke*.

The enemy as faced by Gallifrey and the Time Lords was pretty much incomprehensible; all you could call them was ""The Enemy"". They weren't a race, they were a *different history* - maybe one that had no Time Lords in it, as far as we know. And worse, Gallifrey never actually **lived** the War. It was *coming*. It was in their **future** - a future they weren't supposed to know about, if they'd followed their own rules. Instead, they bent the hell out of the rules, preparing for this future war. In fact, it was Classic companion Romana who was President of the Time Lord Council and ""War Queen"".

There's controversy as to how this all ended. Lawrence Miles and fans of the Faction dispute the badly written novel that ended it, [*The Ancestor Cell*](http://www.drwhoguide.com/whobbc36.htm). But in it, the only way the Doctor could save the universe from the War was... well, was to **blow up** Gallifrey. None of this wussy ""lock it in a time bubble"", but flat-out **blew it up**.

None of this suited Russell T. Davies. **So he ignored it**.

Was it ""Classic Who""? Depends. It was pre-Ninth Doctor, so ""yes it was"". It happened in books that Davies ignored and **flatly contradicted**. So, did it (fictionally) ""happen"" at all? ""Maybe not"".

Who the hell knows? Davies has flat out said he would leave it to the fans to work out the unifying theories.


Your second question: how did the Doctor have a grand-daughter?

The first Doctor was on the run from the Time Lords, exiled, with his ""grand-daughter"" Susan - the first Companion. Never explained adequately in the series. But in the post-first-TV-series Virgin books, most of the mysteries of the Doctor's existence were finally settled in a book called [*Lungbarrow*](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na60.htm).

""Lungbarrow"" was the name of the Doctor's House (home / family affiliation). The ebook used to be available on the BBC website. If you can't find it, PM me.

Gallifrey's modern society was founded by three - Rassilon, Omega and ""the Other"". For various historical reasons, Gallifrey was sterile - no children born; happened as Rassilon successfully took control of Gallifrey. That's why Rassilon funded research into **regeneration** and instituted population control of a sort. Rassilon's society, even back then, was not ideal for everyone. Hence, ""the Other"", refusing to be a part of it, threw himself into one of the Looms (Gallifreyan-new-baby/person making device). Large amounts of the Other's DNA/biodata rewove itself into the Gallifreyan who would become the Doctor.

(Once again, the new series screws over the old - the new series shows us the young boy Master and the Doctor tells us stories of being children. Then again, the Eighth Doctor movie also tells us stories of the Doctor being a child with his father and **his human mother**, making the Doctor **half-human**. And no, that was never explained **either**.)

The Other's grand-daughter, *Susan*, was left alone, in a time of civil unrest (outright rebellion?).

In the ""future"", the Doctor stole his TARDIS, helped by the [Hand Of Omega](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_7h.htm) (and once again, the new series screwed over the old history - the episode with Clara helping the first Doctor, we see Susan getting into a TARDIS first). The TARDIS, boosted by the Hand, broke Gallifrey's rules and barriers, going back into *Gallifrey's own history*.

Into Gallifrey's Rassilon-age past, the Doctor emerged. Susan found and recognised ~~the Doctor~~ her grandfather, the Other's DNA/biodata as a part of the Doctor.

Hence, ""the Doctor's grand-daughter"" - Susan.

If you're confused, it's because the writers step all over each other, don't give a damn about previous continuity and leave it to the fans to suck up the confusion. Sorry.

If it helps, there are ways to think about it: parallel universes. Or *spawned* universes. The Eighth Doctor novel *The Ancestor Cell* has the TARDIS trying to split universes (kinda the way the Master turned the TARDIS into a *Paradox Engine*). One universe has the Doctor as we know him. Another universe has the Doctor as an agent of *Faction Paradox* - and the Faction are struggling to survive.

Feel free to think that a third universe exists now - one where the ""earlier"" Time War (*ha-ha*) had an event which **undid** the Time War with the Enemy and the Faction... and with that old ""Classic series"" universe #1, the ""new universe"" #2 with the Faction and **without the Doctor**... there's now a **third** universe - with the Doctor, but with a spawned, forked history where the Time War happened **again** and **differently**... inheriting **some** but ***not all*** of the old #1 universe.

:Extra Ramblings:  
Regarding your link about the Oxford Dictionary, it is interesting but also worrying that the word is defined as a ""law"" term there. The snarky side of me would say, ""A better place for it to go would be in the Urban Dictionary.""

It is also the start of a slippery slope.

Recently there was a UK reddit post saying ""[UK Police Orders Registrars to Suspend Domains of Major Torrent Sites][dodge]"".

[dodge]: https://pay.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1o1x7b/uk_police_orders_registrars_to_suspend_domains_of/

""Torrents"", the technology known as ""torrent"" and ""torrenting"" are not illegal.  
[(Here's Moby saying it better than I can do via Imgur)][moby].
[moby]: http://imgur.com/Hwbvvjv

I wonder one day if it would be defined in the Oxford Dictionary as an illegal activity. Would it be regarded as one because it is there (in the dictionary)? (My argument goes for ""intellectual property"", is it now regarded as a ""law"" term because it is there)?

What about ""encryption""?
I wonder if we will ever have ""see: Cyber Crime"" quote added to its terminology.

A person does not have to look in media far to see that label being added to it already.

Anyway, I ramble, but my message is that I really hope that we, as people of the UK, must not fall to the psychological ""priming"" that is happening with a lot of legal (and possibly complex) technology because if we do, we are only going to limit and ""hurt"" ourselves.

Also, my question to you (and anyone reading) is, as you say, ""the law doesn't define the English language."", so then, what does?

1st Doctor: *An Unearthly Child*. *The Daleks*. *The Edge Of Destruction* if you want a TARDIS-centric, more-psychological thriller. *The Time Meddler* if you want to see the first other Time Lord. *The Dalek Invasion Of Earth* to see the first companion leave (and that the Earth is still doomed to be invaded by the Daleks). And maybe *The Tenth Planet*.

2nd Doctor: *The Mind Robber* (it'll help you cope with all the contradictions in later episodes/series). *The War Games*.

3rd Doctor: *Inferno* if you want your first parallel universe. *The Mind Of Evil* if you want the first episode of the Master. *The Time Warrior* for the first Sontarans and the first Sarah Jane. *The Three Doctors*. *Planet Of The Spiders*.

4th Doctor: *The Deadly Assassin* to see Gallifrey. *Genesis Of The Daleks* to see the ""first salvo"" in the Time Lords' war against the Daleks. *Warriors Gate*, *The Keeper Of Traken* and *Logopolis* to see regeneration, e-Space, the Master taking a new body and general awesomeness.

(If you want more History-of-Gallifrey, add *The Brain Of Morbius*, *The Invasion Of Time* to see the Doctor as President of the High Council of Time Lords; *The Ribos Operation*, *The Pirate Planet* and *The Armageddon Factor* if you want to see the introduction of Romana, another Time Lord called Drax and three-sixths of the Key-To-Time series. *Destiny Of The Daleks* if you want to see the Dalek-Movellan War and the recovery of Davros. **Shada** for more Gallifreyan history. And not the Eighth Doctor remake, either.)

5th Doctor: *Castrovalva* 'cause awesome SF concepts. *Mawdryn Undead* to see the Brigadier in a role that Ian should've been in. *The Five Doctors* 'cause duh. *Caves Of Androzani* for Master and regeneration.

**Edit**: whoopsie. Should've added *Arc Of Infinity*, you get to see Gallifrey, the Doctor becoming President ***again*** and Omega, after his first appearance in *The Three Doctors*.

6th Doctor: *The Two Doctors*, *The Ultimate Foe* to see the future-semi-Doctor Valeyard.

7th Doctor: *Remembrance Of The Daleks* or your life is meaningless. *Silver Nemesis*. *The Greatest Show In The Galaxy* to understand the scale the Doctor now plays in. *Battlefield* to realise that the Doctor will be Merlin. *Survival*.

8th Doctor: well, it's not like you have a lot of choice. Are you open to audios and novels instead of TV?

'cause if you are, there's just **so much awesomeness** that the old TV series could never cover due to budget constraints - and the new series will never cover, simply because they're written for a less mature, advanced audience.

If you're going old-to-new, throw in the 3rd Doctor's *Spearhead From Space* - for the Autons who appeared in the first 2005 episode *Rose*. Also *The Silurians* to see where the hell Vastra comes from.

And would, finally, suggest the spin-offs. *Torchwood*. And then, my personal super-favourite spin-off (I just did a Halloween costume for it), ***Faction Paradox***.

The Faction got its start in the between-series novels, got spun off into its own universe with barely a mention of the Doctor, and certainly not by name - he's only ever referred to as the **Evil Renegade**, the Time Lords are the **Great Houses**, TARDISes are sentient, talking, walking **timeships**.

Unfortunately, one unlucky person has to 'win'. But they still get their benefits so it's fine; even if they are working 40 hours for £56.80 per week. Although, they still have to be actively looking for and applying to jobs, just because it might not work out.

The new apprentice may be overjoyed with their newfound job security. However, they managed to overlook just how expendable they are. I mean, how many other people went for that interview? Would the company hesitate for even a second to replace them if they complained or even if the company had a bad quarter?

The final milestone: the one year mark. Their apprenticeship has passed that point, which means the government requires them to pay you a normal wage. But will they?

My reading of ""Only trademark, patenting and copyright exists"" is that intellectual property doesn't exist. On reflection, maybe that's not the intent - ""in law"" was just unstated.

&gt; defined as a ""law"" term there

They used the word ""law"". Maybe being related to the law isn't meant to be the same as being a legal term. It'd be nice if they could avoid that confusion, but there are clearly plenty of words that somehow relate to the law but aren't legal terms, and plenty of other similar classification-pedanting issues.

&gt; UK Police Orders Registrars to Suspend Domains of Major Torrent Sites

Yes, I saw the story.

When Orwell described ""newspeak"" as a tool for oppression and control in 1984, I think he was very perceptive, even though I don't think linguistic control really makes ideas unthinkable - as Pinker points out, if you've ever had an idea you couldn't put into words, you've proved that the right words aren't necessary to have an idea.

To that extent I agree with you, but I don't think being authoritarian about language is any defense from abuses of authority - I think it just means whoever's doing it is trying to be an abusive authority themselves.

&gt; the law doesn't define the English language."", so then, what does

Everyone and no-one - the language evolves through people using it, and agreeing that what they're using is that language. Some languages have formal authorities, but even they lose fights against reality quite regularly.

&gt; As a follow-up to your answer, do you think ""torrent"" would be added to the Oxford dictionary? What do you think the definition of ""torrent"" will be?

The word ""torrent"" is already there, of course - just not with the new meaning. If I were compiling a dictionary, I would base it on how I observe language being used, of course - dictionary compilers are supposed to do observe and record.

In the short term I'd say torrent is a technology for sharing files over the internet. That the core technology is based on peer-to-peer networking, but there's an ecosystem around that, giving ""torrent"" a slightly wider meaning. And I might say that copyright infringement is commonplace within that ecosystem, depending on how many words of description were permitted beyond the core definition.

In years to come - torrenting is so common, the word could easily generalise, maybe to mean peer-to-peer file sharing in general - similar to ""hoover"" now meaning any vacuum cleaner. And honestly, copyright infringement is such a commonplace part of torrenting that if the word evolves to refer to piracy you can't automatically blame the copyright industry and authorities - peoples perceptions react to what's there, you don't get to dictate an interpretation, particularly in the face of the blatant reality.

BTW - It bugs me that torrent sites are being blocked. I have a bunch of retro programming books I've scanned that I'd like to share - copyright infringement yes, but I doubt anyone cares. I'm not anti-torrent, but that doesn't mean I'll lie about the reality of torrents. Sure, torrenting itself isn't illegal, but the vast majority of torrents *are*. And I know about all those legal rulings about VHS recorders, and the difference between civil and criminal law and blah blah blah - that still doesn't mean I have to pretend torrents are all nice and blameless.

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"&gt;My university Maths exams often start with ""Define X"" or "" State X Theorem"". There's a reason for that and that reason is that you can't make any progress if you have to keep looking things up all the time.

Who knows, maybe I'm an exception to the rule, but i find it incredibly useful to look things up all the time and not be bothered about remembering them. Do I remember Weierstrass's Theorem of Complex Analysis? No, of course not. Am I able to look it up? Yes.

In terms of the actual exams, I never said testing massively improved in university. As I recall though, ""Define X"" questions were only worth one or two marks whereas application or proof was worth much more (granted they would often use the definition/theorem/formula at some point).

To explain the discarding business, all I can do is ask how you were taught in your first year? For me there was an awful lot of reevaluation but I guess your school maths may have been taught with better rigour?

&gt;You've misidentified the problem. The problem is that the applications of the formulae in exams are too simple and that isn't solved by providing students with a comprehensive formula booklet (or made worse by taking it away).

Clearly, giving people formula booklets is never going to have much significance. Those who know what they're doing probably know the formula anyway and those who don't, often won't know how to apply it. However, a formula reference book does bring an exam slightly closer to real life and slightly further from an arbitrary test.

Furhter, one of the biggest problems as far as I can see is that the teaching of maths in schools (among other subjects) is done too much by rote and Gove wants it to be increasingly so. IMO it is of far greater benefit to know why you solve a problem in the way you do than the solving in itself. You learn a lot more about how to tackle other difficulties and obstacles.",0,1383444909,null,0,false,0,cd5heed,t3_1poglp,t1_cd5heed,t1_cd58n42,null,1428882543,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"&gt;why don't they include the Christmas special as the first episode of a season? I mean its critical and usually the best ones, so why don't they go and call it ""episode 1"" or something?

Because they're produced independently of the season, meaning they don't belong to a season at all. The actual first and last episodes of each season are designed as first and last episodes, so if you consider a Christmas special the first episode of a series, then you have two episodes that function as first episodes right in a row.

&gt;Also, if you buy the DVD/Blu ray collection, do they include the Christmas special or just the regular season?

They include the Christmas special, but only in the complete sets. This only really applies to Series 6 and 7 - Complete Series 6 contains the 2010 Christmas special, but Series 6 Part 1 does not; Complete Series 7 contains the 2011 and 2012 Christmas specials, but Series 7 Part 1 and Part 2 do not. The other seasons weren't split, so they only have the complete sets, which contain the Christmas specials.

&gt; Alsoooo, those specials after season 4, those 4 episodes that stretched for 2 years, how do I search those up? Do they count as season 4.5? Or what? How do I look them up?

They're considered the 2009 Specials (though it's really the 2008-2010 Specials, as *The Next Doctor* was Christmas 2008 and *The End of Time, Part Two* was New Year's Day 2010).

Most apparent, ""GNU/Linux"" vs ""Linux"". It's far more practical to just call it ""Linux"" and recognise that most desktop distros have significant components from GNU. But they just have to be bitchy about it - ""disapproving"" of certain operating systems instead of trying to work with them. Oh, and all [this silliness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Richard_Stallman_by_gisleh_01.jpg).*

The way I treat the two names is like we treat names for animals. Animal species have scientific names, and normal, conventional names. When I talk to people, I will call Linux desktop distros ""Linux"". When I write technical pieces about Linux and GNU/Linux, or where any distinction really needs to be made, I will refer to it as ""GNU/Linux"" (not that I have written any yet).

But yes, I recognise that the FSF and Richard Stallman play a role of pressure group in the entire software development community. The net effect of all the opinions in the open source community (incl. Torvalds, Schneier, etc) create something that I like. And it's also important to recognise that [the usage of words and language *might* actually affect entire cultures](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21518574).

To both people, I'd suggest using more neutral lingo, words which both sides of the 'spectrum' can identify with, and which everyone can use, no matter how technically inclined they are or aren't, and no matter how much they agree or disagree with IP legislation.

 Because as much as in principle it is a good thing to be loyal to the manager, what good will the loyalty do the club? His style and decision making are, I believe; not what is costing us points this season, but what is costing us style. Style and attitude. 
 Of course the players need to take some responsibility, Alan Shearer had a lovely time pointing that out on MOTD today. And to be honest, the score is harsh. Yes we were played off the pitch, but had we kept a clean sheet until half time (i know, i know) then 3-0 FT at the Etihad is about right. Trouble is we are in the business of collapsing these days, and that is why I think Hughton needs to go.

 Does anyone else remember how under Lambert if we got beaten one week hed not accept it and the next game wed at least make a bloody good go of winning. This year I just think we approach every game in the same pragmatic (read ""boring"") manner.

What they need is an option for the interested but feckless for the car to be tuned for your current circuit at the touch of a button, so you're just instantly in at least the ballpark for the proper tuning. Albeit that doesn't account for driving styles!

true,mitchiesue,smith,Smith,"I'm not sure which random women you're talking about because the old woman Eleven has really has as close to romantic as he can get relationship with is River (you can't even say he has one with the TARDIS, because it's more of a comfortable husband/wife thing), and autistic? Really? But like you said in another comment, it's subjective. For me, the Eleventh provides the more ""alien"" character. The Doctor shouldn't be relatable like one of the human characters, because he's not a human character. Maybe that's where you see autistic-like behavior, but I see it as him not knowing the humanistic ways to act. As for bad writing, Moffatt may not have a perfect record. There are some episodes from his show running era that fell flat, but overall, there is more continuity and flow than anything RTD produced. The singularly stellar episodes to come out of Davies' years with Tennant were Midnight and maybe Waters of Mars, and those two were his most simplistic in terms of the ""big bad"". Davies sacrificed good story-telling for super emotional sap, whereas Moffatt could show great emotion without going over the top, and provide interesting and compelling stories. He does provide a more ""fairy tale"" approach, but that is a great throwback to television of old. And, for me at least, that is how I like it.",0,1383455426,null,0,false,0,cd5kpf7,t3_1ppfxh,t1_cd5kpf7,t1_cd5gwrx,null,1428881000,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I like the RAF badge with the Eagle and Crown, as opposed to an RAF monogram.

Unfortunately most of these are not designed for really walking with, as they are much shorter, and may not support much weight.

I got a Vortex Manipulator from Thinkgeek, although I am a little disappointed in it. It's mostly rubber and plastic that doesn't bend very well. The wrist band is also of the same material, and the buckle is plastic. Fortunately, the band is easily taken out and replaced, so I will grab something that bends better and is longer (barely goes around my wrist).

Renting is generally your best bet but can be a little expensive because it's peak demand. If your taking the cars or bikes consider renting further a field. Depending how many additional days you are staying renting in southern Ireland is often cheaper and nicer for a holiday. If you're just there for the Sat obv it's worth being near the track.

There is a lot of talk of it being either expanded to two days or having the option to run completely on Sunday rather than Sat if the weather is bad. So when you're booking itd be worth having a plan for that. 

Another thing I'd mention is grandstand seats. Normally I'm not interested but the one at the NW200 offer a lot. You get sat right on the start line and get the view of the podium and big screen.

true,devineman,logo,,"There's a long story to this but the short answer is that I don't really rate him as a manager of City.

I think he was appointed for bad reasons, I think he has no chance to build anything, I absolutely don't think he understands the nature of Premier League football and he shows this on almost every away day, and I think some of his decisions are extremely questionable and show a lack of long term thinking.

I wrote this a few days back that sums it up for me:

&gt;Winners win trophies. Losers talk about how holistic their youth development policies are. 

One of the most fucked up things about modern football culture is the media driven belief that you can be a good manager without winning trophies and a bad one whilst doing so.

His decision to drop Hart is pretty far up there for me as one of those decisions that make me think he's working for the next year rather than next 5 years.  

He decided to succomb to media pressure and drop a goalkeeper against a team who has the least amount of attacking threat in the entire league.  Hart could have played that game and the chance of a mistake was about the same chance as if I was in net.  

The decision to drop him wasn't based on tactical nouse or a worry about the result, it was because Hart lacks confidence.

Goalkeeping is an enormously specialised position.  I'm not in the habit of saying that we shouldn't drop City players because of form as anybody who has read my take on Dzeko or Nasri would tell you.  But outfield and goalkeeping are different and need to be treated as such.  

Joe Hart is a great talent, I'm not sure anybody really doubts this.  He has room for improvement sure, but he is in the top echelons of goalkeepers as far as his ability is concerned.  His problem is one of confidence.

I can't really describe how important it is to be mentally confident for a professional footballer.  It's why they have so many pre-match superstitions and rituals, it's not because they're all insane, it's because it is mentally cleansing for people to perform a ritual then walk out there knowing that they are absolutely ready for the match.  

Sir Bobby Robson once told a story about Gazza when he was on England duty.  Gazza was looking a bit nervous and fidgeting with his shorts in the dressing room.  Sir Bobby went over to him and asked him if everything was alright and he complained that his shorts were too tight and he couldn't run in them properly.  Calling the kit man over, Sir Bobby took off Gazza's shorts, walked behind a screen, wrapped the same shorts in plastic then came and presented them to him again.  This time Gazza thought that the shorts fitted perfectly, went out and had a fine game.  The point here is that if Gazza wouldn't have ""changed"" his shorts, he would have played extremely poorly as he felt that something was ""wrong"" and those are the types of things that kill your performance levels.  

Joe Hart is unhappy with his goalkeeping coach.  It's that simple.  He wants to work with Dave Watson.  Unsurprisingly, he wants to work with Watson probably not because he thinks he is the best coach in the world and that everybody else is inferior but because he worked with him at Birmingham and has put his time there on a pedestal mentally where everything went really well for him.  He psychologically is trying to recreate a comfort level for himself so he has no distractions.  Despite any technical reason that Hart or his media leakers may bring up with Watson, he wants him for the same reason that Gazza wanted his ""new"" shorts; because otherwise he's too concerned with it and doesn't focus.

And therein lies the problem; dropping him solves nothing.  Clean sheets and saves are what give keepers confidence, not this idea of ""well that will inspire him to work harder!"".  Goalkeepers are not strikers, Hart doesn't need to work hard because he's already good enough, he needs to get his mind together and that just takes time.  It takes even more time if he's sat on the bench and his manager publicly drops him and shows no faith in him.

And by faith, this is the important thing.  Playing Hart doesn't show that Pellegrini has faith to keep a clean sheet, playing Hart shows that Pellegrini has faith in him to turn his problems around and that the team ethic of ""win as a team, lose as a team"" has some bearing.

But my Pellegrini problems started before Hart and have as much to do with Soriano and what Pellegrini represents to City as much as Pellegrini the man.  I don't personally believe that Pellegrini is doing what is in the best interests of City and instead is doing what is in the best interests of himself and his job.  Playing a full team in the Carling Cup after lauding his youth policy all summer?!

We've had about 120,000 of those types of managers in the last 20 years at City and it never ends well.  ",0,1383478854,null,0,false,0,cd5okwu,t3_1posvl,t1_cd5okwu,t1_cd4mxfc,null,1428879122,7,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7

As for inflation, it didn't rise when the minimum wage was introduced, the cost of living is higher in Australia due to the cost of imports, being at the arse end of the planet has disadvantages. 

The fact is, as the minimum wage drops below inflation, we become poorer as a nation. We buy less goods, we generate less tax while asking for more help. 

Paying a nation below a living wage isn't sustainable long term, the problem has to be addressed or we face severe social &amp;amp;amp; financial problems.

true,theinspectorst,null,null,"At the serious risk of downvotes, I'm going to try to state the counter-argument. I'm conscious that you just never hear this stated.

The worst sort of unemployment is long-term unemployment. Not only because it sucks massively to be out of work for 12 months plus, but also because the longer you've been out of work, the less likely it is that you'll *ever* get a job again - and after 12 months your odds become really slim.

This is partly because prospective employers know that the longer someone has been out of work, the more their workplace skills will atrophy. It's also because if you've been out of work for that long, a lot of prospective employers will assume that you've gone to dozens of other interviews during that time and that those employers found some problem - and they may decide it's not worth their time to interview you now when they've got 10 or 20 other applicants for the job already.

All this means that long-term unemployment becomes self-sustaining, but often due to no fault of the unemployed themselves.

The first priority of a good government policy on unemployment should therefore be to prevent people going 12 months (or any prolonged period) without any work experience to show for it on their CV - i.e. to show future employers that they are hireable. That's why they want people to work while receiving Jobseeker's Allowance after a certain amount of time, so they're able to put it on their CV and name an employer as a reference on their next job application. And then the second priority should be to find ways of coaxing employers to take a chance on the long-term unemployed - which is where ideas like 'try before you hire' come from. 

Tl; dr - My point is that these sorts of workfare programmes are rooted in an understanding of how private employers make hiring decisions, how long-term unemployment takes hold and how to prevent it.",0,1383479546,null,0,false,0,cd5onwn,t3_1ps05h,t1_cd5onwn,t3_1ps05h,null,1428879083,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Moving on, when this bill actually passes, Parliament will listen to advisors, who recommend putting some effort in, and building a stable system, and will then promptly opt for the cheapest option from a private company, which will then break down within 2 weeks due to the private company not actually having any staff due to a lack of proper research, requiring expensive repairs using the government administrative system, which could have done the whole thing for half the price anyway, ultimately costing far more than budgeted and taking a few extra years to implement.

In addition there are millions of people in part time work also looking for full time positions and millions more in full time positions looking for a better job.

According to the last ONS release, there are 900k people unemployed (and seeking employment) for more than 12 months. That's nearly enough to fill all the vacancies in the country twice over. I believe work experience should be offered and readily available through the jobcentre for those that want it but I don't think it should be forced upon claimants as an employer is just going to get unwilling staff.

Having been on mandatory courses as well as workfare programmes, the majority of people are there because they are mandated to be. Instead of mandating people that don't want to attend, high quality education/experience/opportunities should be available to those that want it.

There are not enough jobs for everyone and the bottom 3% of our workforce is not going to get a look in, either because they don't want to, or because they have the wrong attributes. It might be a little brutal, but I'd say leave them alone, give them enough to survive and leave a ladder they're free to climb whenever they choose... but stop trying to push people up it.",0,1383485150,null,0,false,0,cd5pimv,t3_1ps05h,t1_cd5pimv,t1_cd5onwn,null,1428878684,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Do you even understand why IP laws exist? They are there to protect the owners of IP so that others don't profit from their honest work. Despite what you think they are fair.

If IP laws didn't exist then Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema would have gone broke because the first cinema to buy rights to play their film would just break the contract and pirate it to sell cheap in HD.

Just… follow my train of thought here:

A large percentage of the public don't like the fact that benefit claimants get 'something for nothing'. Let's ignore the fact that claimants who have previously worked have already paid into 'the system' and imagine, for now, that the world really is—as the tabloids would have you believe—split into 'strivers' and 'skivers'.

Benefits are paid by the government. One could argue—and many do—that benefits are technically paid by the strivers, but let's assume (for now) that the issue of whether or not taxation is—as the libertarians would argue—theft is a separate issue. If we are to believe that all money should be earned, the 'skivers' are surely then indebted to the government. Not Poundland.

If I withdraw £56.80 from an ATM using my credit card, I owe my bank £56.80. I cannot clear my debt by donating £56.80 to Poundland.

Since the 'strivers' vs. 'skivers' rhetoric relies on the fact that work is of value, the government is effectively subsidising Poundland. If the 'strivers' are paying the government in taxes, and the government is paying the 'skivers' in benefits, and the 'skivers' are paying Poundland in labour, the only party which is getting anything for free is Poundland.",0,1383487403,null,0,false,0,cd5pz61,t3_1ps05h,t1_cd5pz61,t1_cd5nok4,null,1428878470,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

[Their probable source](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html#.UnZf8Pn0G1U) (I remember the article too)

To quote the QI page:

&gt; However, there is a theory that Alice is not a widely imaginative children’s fantasy after all – it is a bitter, satirical attack on Victorian mathematics.

Literary theories, in the absence of the author's own confirmation or denial, are much more like what creationists think theory mean when they say ""evolution is only a theory"", not the scientific theories somebody like yourself is around every day.  The author's intention cannot be proven after their death, which is why Shakespearian scholars still have jobs.

Bayley certainly makes a convincing argument towards the scenes that were added when Carroll, or Dodgson, if you prefer, was expanding his story for publication as a full novel, not ""the entire thing"", and she may well be right. However, she does also limit her mathematical interpretation principally to those later additions, not the original frame of the story.

This is the problem with QI; to get viewers, they often present questionable theories as facts, or overstate their importance.  I daresay Bayley's closing paragraph would be used in support of this:

&gt; I would venture that without Dodgson's fierce satire aimed at his colleagues, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland would never have become famous, and Lewis Carroll would not be remembered as the unrivalled master of nonsense fiction.

Because as you and I both know, no author ever overstates the importance of their own or pet theories, and the generations of children who have loved Carroll's work are fully versed in the rise and fall of euclidean mathematics.

true,Lilday,England,[Red XJ6N],"Alright I'm no mechanic, but I've played around with multiple bikes and never had an issue.

- Search google for a PDF of the ER6N workshop manual.

- Haynes manuals can be OK *sometimes*, but I wouldn't spend the £ on one unless you really want one.

- Youtube is great for videos. Simply searching ""remove motorcycle rear wheel"" will do the trick. Might even find an ER6N video.

---

That said, hopefully this helps:

- Put the bike on a paddock stand.

- The rear wheel is held on by a spindle. Just think of it as a really long bolt that goes through the wheel.

- One end of this will look like a bolt head. (usually on the right of the bike [opposite side to the sprocket]). The other end is a nut, identify this by seeing the thread sticking out. You can't really get it wrong.

- Loosen the nut, NOT the bolt side. Usually somewhere between 17mm &amp; 21mm IIRC.

- Your rear wheel is now loose. Don't fucking ride the bike! haha

- Once the nut is off, tap the spindle back through the wheel. It'll pull all the way out and your wheel will drop down.

- Keep an eye out for any spacers. A good way to make sure stuff stays in its proper place: If you remove something from the left of the bike, put it on the floor on the left of the bike. Same for the right. That way you don't mix up any spacers.

- Now the rear wheel is free, don't go near the rear brake pedal. Squashing the pads together now can be a pain in the ass to fix.

- Now is a good time to remove the sprocket carrier (it will just pop off the wheel) and clean it up. Also clean the brake calipers if you fancy it.

- Your wheel is removed and ready to take to a tire-fitter.

---

If you wanna fit the tire yourself:

- Remove the valve cap

- Remove the valve so the tire is completely flat (it probably is already)

- Search youtube for methods of motorcycle tire bead breaking. I personally would take it to a shop because it is a pain in the ass most of the time.

- Search youtube for the zip-tie method of removing tires. It is actually pretty cool.

- Use the same method to fit the new tire (check rotation arrows)

- Once the tire is on, pump it up to the correct PSI. You should hear it pop twice as the tire beads fit into position.

---

Re-fitting

- pop the sprocket carrier back on if you removed it

- Good idea to grease up the spindle...multi-purpose grease should do it

- make sure any spacers are in the right place

- Put the rear wheel in place and slide the spindle through. Don't tighten it up yet

- adjust your chain

- Probably best to use a torque wrench (using the manual) to torque up the rear wheel spindle to the correct torque.",0,1383490750,null,0,1383490961,0,cd5qtx8,t3_1prswr,t1_cd5qtx8,t3_1prswr,null,1428878073,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

I can think of two obvious legal issues with targeting ads in a public place. Violation of privacy and defamation.

If the ads are targeted, other people can draw inferences from which adverts are targeted at you. When those inferences are correct, that can tell people things we don't want known. And sometimes the targeting will get it wrong, telling people things that simply aren't true.

I can't think how this could lead to someone being mistaken for a paedophile and murdered by a mob, but it'll probably happen. When millions of people are getting targeted ads in public nationwide, bizarre flukes will happen every day.

He comes back to us where he is never going to make the squad and gets sent out on loan again.  so instead of being 26 years old and a important player for a team in a lower league (San Jose) he is 26 and bouncing around trying to find somewhere to play regularly.",0,1383491170,null,0,false,0,cd5qyah,t3_1pss5t,t1_cd5qyah,t1_cd5mqoe,null,1428878015,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

The first sub of Dembele for Sandro was not the right call.  I think it would have been wise to sub off Paulinho.  Sandro was motm for me.  This was evident as soon as Sandro was off the field.  Our team looked weak and Dembele was invisible.

Secondly, if we play inverted wingers, we should be playing two attacking midfielders rather than Soldado.  He does not get the service with Townsend on the right and Lennon on the right.  Both players cut inside and allow for people to get into the box and crowd the ball out.  We need an out and out winger who is going to run the line and put a ball into the box, rather than cutting back inside.

Holtby was good.  Putting Everton under a lot of pressure, but he seemed like he didn't want to put a through ball in or anything like that.

true,WillSpur,flair2,,"My thoughts:

- Eriksen should have been on a lot sooner. He looked bright the moment he came on.

- Content with a draw, but SO frustrated yet again we don't capitalise on all the pressure and possession.

- We are still struggling to feed players in the box and it's time for Eriksen to be getting regular Premier League football, he looked good when he came on. 

- Sandro and Jan were stand out performers, so much so that when Sandro was subbed off we lost that bit of composure in front of the back four.

- I understand Jan prefers CB, but seeing how well Vlad (and Kaboul) have performed recently, I wouldn't mind seeing him become our regular LB. It really does complete our back four and he is excellent going forward. Todays performance had echoes of how he played against United at Old Trafford last season. 

- Vlad is still looking solid, great buy for us so far. 

- We should not be starting Defoe, he is too similar to Soldado in that he is only as good as the service he receives. He got his chance after his Europa performances and didn't take it. 

- Defensively we are excellent still.

- Lennon doesn't provide much on the left, he should remain an alternative/rotation for Townsend on the right. 

- I'm failing to see how the coaching staff cannot see how badly we run out of ideas when we reach the opponents box. Get the boys working on that incisive forward passing (again...see Eriksen). Seriously, we are 10 games into this problem repeating itself now.

- ...that said we do perform a lot better away from home, teams come at us and it lets us express ourselves more. But the goal scoring is still an issue. ",0,1383492973,null,0,1383495742,0,cd5ribv,t3_1pt7oi,t1_cd5ribv,t3_1pt7oi,null,1428877755,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Simple answer for you, don't watch the new show if you don't like what's happening. I fail to see how River, Jenny and meta 10th are retcons though. River was met during 10's lifetime, and they got married during 11th's. That is not taking anything from the past and changing it. Jenny and meta 10th are created from the Doctor himself, so again, not changing anything in the past, so it is not a retcon.

Have you even watched the new show? There really isn't much retconning at all. You sound like you just read something and said ""omfg the entire new series must be FULL of retcons! fuck the new show!"". It's a show about time travel. Everything is going to be messed up at some point, and you aren't going to like everything because guess what, it's about time travel. Dropped that vase? Go back in time to stop you from ever dropping it. That is how time travel has always worked in movies/TV. That is how it works in Doctor Who. Moffat probably tries his hardest to please classic fans, but sometimes it's hard because it's a show about time travel. You can't please EVERYONE with time travel because something is bound to change at some point.

There is always going to be plotholes with time travel. Things that are all ""why can't he go stop that in the TARDIS?"". That is what you need to deal with when you watch this show. But please, stop using retcon if you don't know what it means because nothing you listed can be considered retcon. Here is the definition: Retroactive continuity, or retcon for short,[1] is the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work. I fail to see how Jenny, River, or meta 10th. I fail to see at any point it was said the Doctor couldn't A. get married (River). B. create an entire person out of his hand (meta 10th) and C. Have someone created from his DNA (Jenny). These were never previously established facts that he COULDN'T do all of this.

Now, on to them dropping the 12 regenerations. First, right now it is very messed up with the Hurt-Doctor. We aren't even sure if 11 is 11, and 12 is going to be 12. So right now the 12 regeneration limit is the least of our worries. Rest assured it has been thought about for awhile by Moffat on how to get around it. Because do you REALLY want the show to just stop? We probably don't even know all the details on the 12 regeneration limit. It could be the time lords used to kill each other if they were going to regenerate into a 13th incarnation. We don't know. 

Now, if you can please list what you ACTUALLY think is retconned, that would be fine, and I will try to help you understand why it was retconned if it actually was, why it is possibly GOOD for the show, and why you need to sit back and relax, and realize that it is a show about time travel. Nothing is going to be 100% all the time, and sometimes you DO need to retcon, because it is very hard to think up explanations for EVERYTHING. But again, I don't understand what you think is retconned outside of what you listed. Please explain.

Paulinho looked tired today, Dembele should have *started* over him, not come in later as a sub for the wrong person. Dembele should have subbed for Paulinho, if anything.

WE NEED TO TRY REAL WINGERS. Enough with this inverted winger shit, I think we average ~1 cross per game, which is dismal and plays a huge role in Soldado being isolated I think. I'm not saying it's a solution, but it's worth a fucking shot. Lennon plays well but he's so much better as a RW, but Townsend's got that spot on lock. Best (uninjured) LW options right now are Siggy and Lamela.

Soldado looked either tired, bored, or maybe injured (based on some faces he was making at one point). In either case, whenever we're hovering around the inside of the box, there's been zero movement inside the box. Zero movement into space. It's unacceptable for a striker and he cannot complain about not getting service whenever he does not put himself in a position that invites it.

AVB should have made the decision to pull Lloris off. He was clearly dazed, and I think even unconscious for a few seconds. Player's always going to want to stay on, but sometimes you need to step in and do what's best for him even if he doesn't agree.

AVB and the squad need to figure out what's going on on offense. We can't keep having these amazing spells dominating other teams with ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. It's frustrating as hell, for both fans and players, and surely must be demoralizing to head into the locker room at halftime knowing all that effort went for nothing.

Holtby, Sandro, and Vert looked really great. Everyone else was generally solid. Soldado was honestly our weak link in the game, basically playing with 10 men until he learns how to get involved in linkup play better.

The problem is Soldado has a limited area where he is effective; the penalty box. Once we get to the final third, we pass the ball around because we don't know what to do, that gives the opposition more time to set-up their defense, and us not knowing what to do is made that much worse.

Pros: Point away at Stoke = a success. Ward-Prowse had some great balls in today. Boruc made the best save of the game. And it could have been 2 for Saints as at least one of the handballs should have been called (especially the second one).

Con: I didn't like how little they used the left side of the field. Shaw didn't really get an opportunity to break and I thought that because of that the attack was a little predictable.

2) Completely agree, Sandro coming was a huge negative impact for us, we looked to have lost all forward movement once we pulled him off the pitch.

3) Completely agree.  We still look to have no clue what to do once we hit the final third.  Matter of fact it looks like the entire squad stops at the 18yd mark.  No one moves. We don't even seem to get the overlapping runs from Walker/Jan as they seem to even turn inside.  I know the lads have been asked to take shots but we aren't taking the right types of shots that can cause opportunities.  Townsend takes booming shots that race high or curve into  the goalie, we want to take shots that make the goalie parry the ball or the defense to move, we don't seem to do this.

We seem completely unwilling to put a cross into the box, i'm not saying that you put a cross into the box every time but there is no shame in putting a cross in and allowing Soldado, Paulinho etc to make something happen on the other end, it also forces the defense to react instead of sitting right in front of our players and cutting off the attack.  The crosses don't have to be high arching lobs, look at the cross that Everton had against us...straight across the goal mouth, nothing came out of it but it was a better opportunity than we had all day.

4) like i said, i will take a result at Goodison any time we can get it, but the poor play of the team in the second half is a concern as we move forward and we need to figure something out that can at least create some scoring opportunities, forget goals at this point i will settle for us creating quality chances just to start.",0,1383494340,null,0,false,0,cd5rycm,t3_1pt7uw,t1_cd5rycm,t3_1pt7uw,null,1428877548,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Its like we just stop moving when we hit the 18 yard mark and start moving sideways, Soldado was standing in the middle at the 18yd mark and waiting, Paulinho and Holtby were passing between each other, Lennon wasn't moving and Townsend was only looking to move inside.

We need to start moving forward, since we are not taking the types of outside shots that cause the defense to move and the goalie to parry the ball we aren't creating chances from the outside chances, we need, NEED to start driving on the outside and opening up more space.  A few more crosses wouldn't hurt, if nothing else it causes the defenders to react and make a play which can cause mistakes which can lead to chances.

true,JohnMulroy,flair5,,"Here are my thoughts....

Lloris: Typical game from the frenchist. He played well and theres nothing to complain about. Did however take a serious hit. Was worried he would not be able to play. 

Walker: He was okay, made his runs, defended decently, Its the typical walker performance we are used to.

Chiriches: Great game. Made some fantastic tackles and was considered ""the weak link"" by the commentators. I think he proved them wrong.

Dawson: Captain played well. Defended the steam train pretty well and made some good strategic fouls without getting booked.

Verts: Great game, he is such a footballer its unbelievable. So composed and so comfortable. HOWEVER, if Coleman (i think) went down im pretty sure we would be having a different discussion.

Townsend: Played well, looked the most threatening on the wings, but he needs to get more connected with Bobby.

Paulinho: He had a good match. Good effort and maybe a little bit leggy from the hull game. 

Sandro: Strait up BEAST. Made Lukaku look like a little winger the way he was bodying him. And he doesnt even flinch when he gets kicked in the chest. Defensively bossed the pitch and somewhat controlled the tempo.

Holtby: Terrier performance from the eager man. He pressured well and controlled his possession well. Would have liked him to connect better with soldado. 

Lennon: Okay game from lennon. He was fast down the wings but lacked a final attacking ball to penetrate. Would have much rather seen lamela on the pitch.

Bobby Soldier: Ohhh poor soldado. I feel so much for him. He needs to get his service. He feels completely disconnected from the match. If we dont provide the service, we are just wasting him up there.

Siggy: Good sub performance from him he had a good shot and offers a good threat from midfield. 

Eriksen: Came on late, would have liked him to start. I think we need the creativity to unlock the defenses. had one good flick when he came on and had a blocked volley Thats all i saw. 

Dembele: Virtually non existant. Did not even see him touch the ball.

Overall: I thought we just lacked that killing blow in the final third. We need to have someone break, beat a man,  and make a pass to bobby or put a good shot on goal. Teams now, will start noticing this. We just keep us passing infront of their box and we cant break them down. I think eriksen needs to start becoming out talisman in midfield. He is the key in my opinion. Holtby is great but he doesnt have the class to cut through a defense with a single pass or touch. Lamela also needs to start getting involved more. The quicker he gets back to his roma form the better. Lennon just isnt dynamic enough anymore. He has the pace and thats it. He didnt show the ability to beat a man and come in to the play or put in some good service. Finally, We just need to give some service to bobby. He is our striker and main poacher. Give him the opportunity to score and he will score. Thats what he is good at.

true,DiscoPopShop,null,null,"Not a Tottenham fan but i'll chime in with my 2 cents:

A lot of people are angry or disappointed with AVB over 3 decisions and I'll start by addressing those. 

1) Lennon starting on the left (ahead of Gylfi/Lamela). The reason for this is obvious. AVB likes to put emphasis on quick transitions, especially when away at Everton who normally keep the ball and have a relatively slow build up. This didn't happen in the first half (for reasons I'll get onto later) and Everton were in fact poor at keeping the ball so Lennon was left in an unfamiliar position without the space he'd have in a counter attack.

2) Holtby over Eriksen. Simple, Holtby works harder while pressing, much harder. This could be a very big reason why Everton struggled to keep the ball (I also believe Lukaku was told to harass Chiriches through the Everton DM's and CB's playing long balls but he was having none of it, MOTM IMO). People say Sandro coming off made Spurs weak in the middle but I think Eriksen coming on for Holtby is the biggest reason Everton dominated from then on.

3) Sandro off for Dembele. This can only be because of fitness, and there's nothing you can do about it. AVB doesn't want relapse and for him to be out for the season, so he brings on Dembele who is a more than capable replacement. 

I'm not saying AVB is infallible but he didn't do much wrong here. 1 point is a good result.

Rubbish. They get £3500 to buy food, pay for light, heating, water and maybe pay a little towards the rent. Their council tax is paid as is the majority of their rent so that £3500 is far from paying for everything.

I did make a mistake on my line there about JSA, but you've pretty much corrected me there.

Really tho, outside of Daily Mail Land, how many people on welfare are lording it up in mansions?  It's by no means a 'free home' it's getting most of your rent paid, you don't get to keep it, also something like 90% of HB claims were from working people last year.

I'm simply saying that considering how we're capping just about everything the poor get from the state, how about capping the amounts MPs can get for certain things to a reasonable level.

Lastly ""So why is it OK for one person to effectively have an unlimited amount of rent paid for by the taxpayer with nothing expected in return"" is just a terrible piece of work, firstly you're limited massively by the bedroom tax, because if you get hit by it, you're losing heating and food money, yet can't afford to move house, even if there was suitable accommodation nearby to move to.  Also, 'nothing expected in return' just shows how well the right wing propaganda by the press has sunk in, the vast majority of people have worked and paid into the system, myself included, and are getting by on the bare minimum until we find work again.

Really irritates me how many people think anyone on any kind of benefits is worthless and has never contributed anything to the public purse.

As you say, it can cost more if you're not well insulated, have an inefficient boiler etc, perhaps we need to get more publicity for the schemes which get people cheap insulation and the like.

One idea is that the long term unemployed need some recent work experience to help them find work. Just having some recent experience to talk about in interviews helps them.

In this case they're not being trialled by companies. The companies are providing an experience gaining service to them and the taxpayer in exchange for free labour. In this model, companies ""trialling"" as many people as possible without offering them jobs could be considered a good thing.
