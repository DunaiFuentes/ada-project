Unfortunately it's quite expensive and time-consuming for a company to sponsor a non-EU applicant's work visa, and this company has obviously decided it's not prepared to go through the hassle.

There's no such thing any more as a generic ""work visa"" where you can come to the UK and start looking for work. Some student visas will permit you to do part-time work, but you have to be enrolled on a course of at least a year in length and it wouldn't be easy to convert that into a work visa if you were offered a full-time position.

Your best bet is to have an in-demand skillset (i.e. something from [the shortage occupation list (PDF)](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf)) and then once you find a job i'ts relatively straightforward for the company to obtain your visa.

Sure, there are a few outfits that are particularly memorable, because they're what they wore in a particularly popular episode, but even then, it's still usually plain clothes.  As a result, most people, even avid Doctor Who fans, won't make the connection that you're actually cosplaying and not just wearing regular old clothes, unless they have some kind of context that would trigger them to associate what you're wearing with Doctor Who.

Tom Baker had the longest run as the Doctor, last for seven years from [1974 to 1981](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker). He was also the first moderately young Doctor and the most eccentric certainly. His distinctive playing of the role seemed to have set a new par for the course for the show. It is definitive that he left his mark on the Who universe, and for these reasons he definitely could be the trademark Doctor; the one that people will see and identify as the Doctor (or to some, ""that Doctor Who guy if the reference is distant,""). I think it is also important to take the grain of salt that classic Who and the reboot have become sort of two shows with a monstrous positive synergy. Unfortunately even if considered separately as its own show, I don't think Eccleston-Tennant-Smith have a real ringer for who gets to represent the reboot. Tennant is seemingly the most likely choice, but I'd say there's enough dissent to arguably leave it undecided. (I'll source this fact on being a college age student who frequently discusses Doctor Who with others who began watching the show at the reboot;  thus they are relative experts on who should of just those three represent it,)

I also have been cruising this subreddit for long enough to know that the Doctor has become symbolic to a lot of people and their favorite Doctor reflects a certain era of their lives; this probably is the one they most associate with Doctor Who, possibly because of good memories during the time or just simply falling in love with the show.

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK first of all you are applying your views of Belfast to the whole order, this is completely ludicrous! We had 18 main demonstrations on Friday and only Belfast county had any problems, and they weren't even the main parade, so your looking at around 5% a very small number (and that's only of the parades on the twelfth).

Belfast is its own little world the Orange there isn't the problem the other elements from the communities that perpetuate the sectarianism there, which does spill into the lodges there. The eleventh night is a bigger deal up there because the likes of the UVF and UDA can do their own thing. 

You may ask why doesn't Grand Lodge of Ireland do something about Belfast? Well its a fraternal society of equals, quite unlike most others in that it is run from the ground up, there is very little Grand Lodge can do within the current structure.

The biggest issue with parades arose with Drumcree, at the time there was still some Protestants living there but by the end of it they had all been pit out. The official policy at the time was not to talk to the 'community' groups because it was believed they were Sinn Fein run, (you have Adams quoted as saying, ""these community groups didn't happen by accident,"" which didn't help the case, not to mention members of Portadown district Orange had lost limbs from a bomb planted by a prominent member of the group, meant that they wouldn't want to anyway) the whole issue was a major shot in the foot on our part and policy has know changed. It could be said that Sinn Fein invented the issue with parades, Drumcree made it real. They made a whole festival of the matter which was vastly inappropriate for a church service and a lot of good men left over it and a lot of numptys joined, who subsequently left after finding out its not all what they thought.

One of the biggest issues we have to deal with is PR, most people don't see anything of us until July, and then all the focus is on the trouble in Belfast. There is no word of the charity work that the Orange does the rest of the year, particularly with widows and orphans

The largest single group with the most casualties during the troubles was the Orange Order! That's more than either the RUC or army, for a non combatant group that is quite substantial, many of these victims were in neither the RUC or army. This is the biggest reason for the policy of no official talks between the OO and SF.

There is no Orange doctrine that does anything but condemns sectarianism, a trait which is grounds to prevent advancement within the order,  however it has a religious basis, which is bible based, and as such disagrees with the teaching of non-reformed faiths. Converts to Protestantism are allowed to join, although the membership form is poorly worded.

Last year ( the year before there was a Black parade) the twelfth was in Newry, (why? It is Newry District's turn every 7 years or so) the council decided it didn't want the main parade in the town centre (other parades from local lodges get to with their own annual feeders without any bother), yet despite this the council asked a band to come into the city centre to play so that people would be attracted in to the shops. Thousands of pounds were made by stalls and there was no bother in a town that is 90% Catholic.

I understand your point though about it being an anti-twelfth, but it was never on the same scale, whereas St. Patrick's day has been used/seen as such in some areas. A few (maybe 8) years ago one of the groups that does community work in Newry was asked to help organise the St. Patrick's day parade in Newry, (it was Protestant run, if any one knew how to run a parade it was them, bar of course asking the Orange) the one stipulation was that there was to be no Tricolours in the procession, (its off putting for Protestants and the day becomes more about Ireland and less about the saint who founded the Celtic Church) the Sinn Fein band decided it needn't worry about the stipulation and carried one anyway, the flag is barely 100 years old what has it to do with a man that never went further south than Newry? This carry on went on for two or three years before the group stopped helping. 

Again it's not all places, my father has played Lambegs in Omagh and Armagh (who even handed out little St Patrick's saltieres, I'm not sure if they still do) and then there is Cormeen Rising sons of William Flute Band who have a parade every year as well, which apparently is quite big, so big they had to change locations to Armagh city a few years back.

At the same time, who can blame people for trying to get an advantage in such a brutal and uncaring society? This is the attitude we're conditioned to have. To have what's considered a decent standard of living and reputation in the civilised world we have to force our kids to stand on the heads of their fellows in the hope they might join the tiny minority of the world's population who enjoy the maximum benefits of a rapacious industrial machine. 

The truly ambitious will strive to have their progeny join the ranks of capitalism's capos who will feel entitled to whip the rest of us into compliance because, having worked so hard to get where they are today, feel they ""deserve"" their privileged situation. 

To get into the ranks of the elites requires slavish devotion to achieving the highest exam results and excelling at several extra-curricular activities. The lives of candidates is so packed full with the need to compete against their fellows they have no time to develop their characters. These poor kids then appear as the sociopathic drones who operate our state, legal, commercial and financial systems. 

Poor fuckers. 

The parents think they are doing their best for the kids since they likely followed a similar path or want their kids to  ""do better"" than them because all that matters in life is the advancement of social status and economic power. 

For the proportion of kids for whom this type of path is a predilection, it's all hunky-dory. For the rest, it is probably an exhausting experience that makes their eventual rendering into sociopaths even more worrying.

This being reddit, I'd like to contend this if I may. In my opinion, it is only [editorised](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/editorialize) if it changes the meaning - of the article. 

Sometimes, news sites are rather poor at headlines - this one for instance fails to explain the issue, and just says ""conflict"", but not what it is over. I think it is reasonable, in situations like that, to add to the headline.

Equally, when a headline says something like ""Home office upset about leak"" if posting to a non-UK subreddit, it is ok to clarify the nation involved.

To be honest, I acknowledge this title isn't ideal, I think I'd prefer if I'd used **Leaked letter shows ISPs and government at war - Government wants porn block by default** - though I guess this may not appease you.

true,Thetonn,null,null,"The best example of this would be alternate curriculum. There are a great number of subjects which are largely dying out in state schools which can be an integral part of a child's education for their chosen career path. The best example of this is classics, whereby unless you want to hire private tutors or send your kids to language schools in the summer it is almost impossible to get children to the adequate standard of Latin and Greek required to actually study the stuff in its original language. The result is that state kids at university are massively impinged compared to the privately educated students. Consequently, for purely academic reasons, sending kids to do that subject is it is what they love is in no way elitist.

The same applies to modern languages. Particularly ones outside the box.

Finally on this, there is special needs. It is important to remember the majority of people who don't do well at school have some kind of learning difficulty or health problem which harms their education.

Done properly and by targeting the right ones, private schools through relentless targeting, focus. Drive and expertise can ensure these children achieve their full potential.

No. If they suspect you're coming just to work you would not make it past border control. An employer also is required to see proof of your eligibility to work in the UK even for British people which a non-working student visa will not have. Any working student visa will have a part time limitation. They get fined £10,000 per person caught working who isn't allowed to. 

If you get caught you get arrested, deported, your passport stamped as such which causes problems getting into other countries and you're banned from entering the UK for 10 years.

There is nothing stopping you from applying for the job.

Which on the face of last week wouldn't be too stupid; I've seen almost every episode of the apprentice and still enjoy the show, but find the latest series verging on the pointless. It's no longer about being an apprentice, but being the investment opportunity for Sugar, which rather makes a mockery of the format. Last weeks episode saw two guys who were pretty decent apprentice candidates booted because their investment idea was terrible/not remotely going to work under the terms Sugar was looking for. He even said he'd offer one a job, but the business idea he had just wasn't good enough. So essentially now the show is a much longer Dragons den, where you have to go through weeks of potentially irrelevant tasks before you're allowed to pitch an idea that may be so bad you're booted regardless of your success at the tasks.

Had Jordon or Neil been 'in the den' they'd have been dealt with in a quick 3 minute segment at best: 'Also trying his luck was Jordan who wanted £250,000 for 15%. - Let's get this right you don't actually own this business?'

* Surrounded by beautiful countryside and quaint villages.  
  
* Home to the fantastic National Media Museum which has seven floors of galleries with permanent exhibitions focusing on photography, television, animation, video gaming, the internet. It was recently voted the best indoor attraction in Yorkshire by the public, and it is one of the most visited museums in the north of England. 
  
* The Hugely popular City Park - A new multi award winning public space in the heart of the city featuring a mirror pool - the UK's largest water feature with over 100 fountains. Many free festivals and events are also held here.  
  
* Building work on a new shopping centre is to start this year to compliment the existing shopping areas we already have - The Kirkgate Shopping Centre and Forster Square Shopping Park.   

* 4 cinemas in the city centre, including Yorkshire's only IMAX and 1 of only 2 Cinerama's in the world (The Pictureville).  

* Bradford is the UK's curry capital, plenty of top restaurants within the city.   
* Bradford was designated as the world's first UNESCO City of Film. The title was awarded because of the city's rich film heritage. 

* The Alhambra Theatre is one of the most renowned theatre's in the north, and attracts the best shows. Next year the Alhambra will be the only stop in Yorkshire for the UK tour of The Lion King.

true,JaiBhambra,flair5,,"I think when he came in January people thought he'd have a direct impact on the team right from the get go. I know he's a player with great potential but never expected immediate fireworks. Part of me thinks that as he often came off the bench he was trying too hard to impress, a little flick here a little flick there. And some options he made in the game were perhaps not great as there was an eagerness about him.

That being said, his buzz is something that really excites me about Holtby. Despite often being regarded as an attacking player he does really look to get stuck in defence wise, tracking back and putting in some tackles. He's definitely got some spunk to him.

Competition is likely to be an issue. I think that he's most effective in the midfield 3 in a 4-3-3, equalled also by his natural #10 position. But Bale's got that free role which often means other good #10 style players have been forced wide (Sig &amp; Holtby). And due to Bale's playing in the middle we found Holtby playing often on the left, especially before the West Ham game. He drifted in a lot, and caused quite a narrowness about the team. After Sig came on against West Ham he impressed on the left, with good showings against Arsenal, and meant Holtby didn't really come in there again.

In my opinion his best games were against City, lovely ball to Defoe, and Everton. He recycled possession well, and looked to keep the ball in the attacking third. The competition in that 4-3-3 will be undoubtedly tough. I think many people have placed Dembele/Sandro/Paulinho as the sort of primary 3. However, Carroll/Holtby/Parker/Livermore/Huddlestone will all be rotated depending on calender, opposition, injuries and suspension. Though I'm quite sure Huddlestone will probably not be a Spurs player come September, and Livermore will potentially have a premier league loan (if not, his playing time will still be very limited). I think even with this competition we'll be seeing a lot more Holtby in the midfield 3, he's already stated that he feels he's most effective there. 

As for Holtby #10, for when we do play 4-2-3-1, I think it'll be tough. He'll likely be behind the pecking order for many, even with injuries it'll be tough. Townsend will likely have a breakout Spurs season and will be needed for natural width should Lennon be unavailable (or even ousting Lennon, very likely imo). Bale/Sig/Dempsey/Lennon/Townsend will limit his opportunities in the #10 position. 

I think that with a pre-season and less expectation he'll have a solid season for us this year. And we'll expect to see him in a midfield 3 more than as a #10 as there'll be more opportunities. I expect he'll do quite well this season. My two cents. ",0,1373884299,null,0,false,0,cb2yuxx,t3_1ibxob,t1_cb2yuxx,t3_1ibxob,null,1430462460,21,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,21

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;What are the best/worst aspects of his game?

His enthusiasm. Holtby just will not stop probing between opposition defensive lines and his one touch link up play is a serious threat as he can aid in a very speedy transition from defence to attack. 

When transitioning from attack to defence however, Holtby's enthusiasm bites him as it is perhaps a bit over the top causing him to commit a large number of fouls. I suspect that this is just teething problems as he settles into a new league and they will disappear over time.

&gt;How is Holtby best utilized (if you were building a team around him, how would it look)?

The way spurs lined up last season didn't favour Holtby. He likes a striker target in front of him (Huntelaar), and pacey wingers out wide (Germany). With Bale occupying a more central role Holtby typically came on in the back end of games with someone like Dempsey out wide to aim for and Ade/Defoe up front his options weren't grand and they stunted him.

If I was building a team around Holtby it would look like this.

--------------Lloris

Walker - Kaboul - Vertonghen - BAE

--------Sandro - Dembele

----Lennon - Holtby - Bale

Kiessling/Soldado/Jovetic/Benteke

My reasoning is that Sandro/Dembele were quickest at breaking down opposition in the midfield last season and could feed Holtby who in turn could quickly knock the ball forward to some wonderful targets. This would be an unbelievable squad on the counter and in a sustained attack Dembele could push forward to aid Holtby in creation.


&gt;How does Holtby rank against his current competition - Dempsey, Carroll, Ceballos, Siggy, Bale etc?

I would say Carroll/Holtby/Siggy (in no order) have the most promise and thus should demand game time based on that. Also, Bale/Siggy/Holtby are the 'best' players (my opinion) from the lot and should get game time based on that. I would say rankings for next season would be Bale-&gt;Holtby-&gt;Siggy-&gt;Carroll-&gt;Dempsey-&gt;Ceballos. I rate Siggy higher than Holtby as a player currently but actually like him out on the left, where I favour Holtby in the middle.

&gt;What would you like to see happen with Holtby next season, and into the future?

I imagine AVB will have a number of formations in mind that he can switch to in game to unlock opposing defences - this should mean that in EPL games Holtby gets some decent game time. Furthermore he should be playing 90 mins in almost every cup game in order to make his stand for a starting position. Ideally he performs when given minutes in cups and can fight his way into the first team. ",0,1373884770,null,0,false,0,cb2ywyr,t3_1ibxob,t1_cb2ywyr,t3_1ibxob,null,1430462433,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Regarding the healthcare system, the National Health Service is funded through taxation and.  As a result, it's free at the point of care, with a small fee (around £8) for prescriptions in England, though this fee is waived if you have certain long-term conditions.  The NHS is the responsibility of the Department of Health and its Secretary of State, currently Jeremy Hunt, MP.

The main gatekeepers of NHS care are general practitioners (GPs), physicians working in primary care.  In addition to diagnosing and treating illnesses themselves, they are the main route of referral for hospital specialists (such as cardiology, orthopaedics, etc.) and for further investigations (X-rays, scans, scope tests and the like).  There is a greater political impetus to blur the lines between primary and secondary (hospital-based) care, but this is currently the standard.

Unlike other doctors working in the NHS, GPs are independent contractors.  They receive a lump sum to their practice, which goes towards nurses, clerical staff, premises, in addition to their own salaries.  They receive more from the NHS depending on how well they meet certain targets (there are a lot but it's things like the number of patients with chronic conditions receiving regular reviews and how well their patients' blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar are controlled).

In emergencies, anyone can visit a hospital's Emergency Department ( formerly Accident &amp; Emergency, formerly Casualty) to receive treatment and hospital admission if required.  Ambulance services are also run by the NHS and, unlike the US, are separate from the Fire Service.

There is a private healthcare sector in the UK, with private insurance an option for those with the resources.  The advantages are seen as shorter waiting lists for operations (the NHS target states that all operations must occur within 18 weeks).  Recent legislation (the Health and Social Care Act) has opened up services to bidding from the private sector, leading to concerns that they will cherry-pick profitable services like elective operations.

That's probably as much as I can explain without getting to the trivial or the overtly political.  Also, bear in mind that recent changes to NHS administration could lead to the NHS changing drastically in the near future, or chugging along like it has for the last 65 years.

I haven't found a viable alternative way of renting yet but we're always on the lookout.

The only remedy I suggest is that once you are in the house, try to find out your landlord and get to know them personally -they've also paid atrocious fees to the Estate Agent and if you've been a good tenant and they are happy with you, at the end of 12 months they may be happy to go into a contract directly with you and quit the Agents.

After 12 months anyway, the actual contract runs out and you go into a periodic rolling tenancy that doesn't require an Estate Agent at all. This is where the real rip-off is, because the Agent comes round again wanting you to sign a new agreement with fees - you can tell them to sod off - that's what I've done for 6 years so far- however I've always agreed to sign a new contract where they've agreed to cancel the fees.

In general, it's a big cost to a landlord to go without a tenant for a month whilst advertising for a new one, it's beneficial to both for a good, paying tenant to stay. So this can be used as leverage against an Estate Agent that wants to double/triple/quadruple tap you for fees for work (lol) that they've already done.

There's nowhere in that sentence or the rest of what I said that implies it couldn't last *purely* because of a money issue. It says that in the long term, the situation we were in at the time was unworkable.

*That* means I would've needed to find a higher paying job, a cheaper place to live, make other concessions elsewhere etc. - and all because of the assumption that a couple sharing accommodation are entirely financially interchangeable - rather than it being a personal responsibility.

What is little interesting about all this, is the direct misinformation they're attempting to spread about them not being fascist or racist, but then claim that Antifa are the Fascists for not allowing them to spread their views of hate in a democratic society, while going around and attacking different races. The irony is they attempt to use Democracy in their favour, but would remove it soon as they got any power through the BNP or other such parties! 

Also the placing of Poppies on WW2 memorials, attempting to show condolence to the men who died fighting Fascism. I think these are nothing more then smoke screens for their agenda. 

There are now groups which even have gone to the extent to actually use completely phrases, such as 'National Culturists' [1], with the attempt to not use words which invoke racist ideas. They have links to the BNP who are attempting very similar actions. 

But there are more then enough links between the EDL and Fascists. It's like the former racist skinhead groups.

Apologies for going off on a bit of tangent, just these groups do worry some what.

In the end I wasmore proud of myself for choosing not to work for that shit. Anyone who judges or calls everyone on benefits a scrounger yadda yadda is naive and completely ignorant IMO.

Yes, some people take advantage, yes, some people on benefits do nothing but drink and drugs etc.. But not all. But so what? It doesn't affect me personally, people can do what they like as long as they don't hurt others, to judge them makes a much worse person IMO.

But yeah, back to the main point, there's no incentive to work. Working tax credits got cut to the point of a minimum wage job not being topped up, so there's really nothing egging people on to work for that big 50p per hour.

Stupid system, stupid stereotypes.

No it can't, as with any process like this there is always going to be some risk. Can the risk be mitigated so it is almost impossible for anything to go wrong? Yes. There are far more complex, more dangerous processes that have been running for years with nothing going wrong. Mitigating risk is the basis of the chemical industry and if we only allowed things that were 100 per cent not going to fail and do damage then we wouldn't be living in the modern world. The fact is that fracking is more than safe enough as a process, and every indpendent body has said it's OK as long as there are enough regulations reigning companies in.

Proper engineering is designed to fail, there are multiple redundant systems. In only the most extreme scenarios will something go badly wrong if the system is well designed and run (regulation).

The main danger is leaking of fracking fluid through the well casing, what is going to happen in 100 years is nothing, it's a non-problem. 

Climate changed is a different completely argument, I'm talking about the safety of fracking itself.

The concrete and steel piping does not need to be intact forever, it needs to stay intact whilst the fracking is occurring at least, ideally it needs to last for the duration of the well lifespan. Concrete longevity is not a mystery and is easy to predict (I'm not a civie, that's about the limits of my knowledge).

&gt;radio active chemicals brought to the surface

Short-lived isotopes, a non-problem. We use them daily in medical examinations and testing for cracks in piping (including drinking water pipes).

Justice for a victim has significant economic cost, opportunity cost, it is harmful to mental health, to long term social interaction. It is tiring, harmful and stressful.

Retribution is the exchange for this. We agree not just to stop it happening to someone else and to make the dependent into a better person, but that what they did was horrible and necessitates punishment.

Rape victims are only likely to come forward if those accused are going to be punished. Historic child abuse cases are also traumatic and require the belief that the person responsible for all that hurt will be punished,

If not, it is far simpler. Quicker. And easier to just form a mob and murder them.

It worked, and he's never looked outward since.

Back near the start of his term, one of the back benchers asked Cameron about gaming tax breaks (which had been talked about by both parties before the elections), and he did say that it wasn't the time to give out tax breaks. 

Then, this year, the Tories announced that they would indeed be following through with tax breaks, giving a 25% tax break after April 1st 2013. 

However, it was delayed after the European Commission failed the approve the plan, saying there was ""no obvious market failure"" that needed to be addressed. [BBC article about it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22185476)

However, this is a load of rubbish, because movies already have tax breaks, and France, who is within the EU have tax breaks for video games, as well as practically every country who is a major producer of video games.

No, you misunderstand. We aren't talking about the risk of causing harm, we are talking about the inevitable harm done by process.

&gt; Can the risk be mitigated so it is almost impossible for anything to go wrong? Yes. 

No, because by process it is harmful and estimates suggest 0.5 to 1% of lines drilled will fail in some way and when there are thousands of lines drilled that's not going to be an insignificant amount. The process is a side effect, but you can bet the side effects the industry acknowledge as hypothetical will be  a reality.

You are selfish and short sighted. 85% of the toxic hydraulic fluid remains tapped in the ground.

&gt; Climate changed is a different completely argument, I'm talking about the safety of fracking itself.

The safety of fracking is the subject and pretending that the undeniable exacerbatory effects on CO2 emissions is irrelevant is special pleading if not a cowardly dodge.

&gt; Fracking operations are by their very nature **short-lived affairs**, the actual fracking only takes a few days. Most of the time is spent removing the gas. It can be repeated multiple times though.

Excellent slime ball sanitised spin, something I would expect from a lobbyist. You are reducing a 40 year affair down to days, as if the window of risk operates only within this deliberately myopic framing. It's like saying a dental crown is the two minutes it takes for the prosthetic to be cemented in place, ignoring the painful injections around your gum, the drilling, and the likely 24-48 hours of discomfort afterwards.

My perspective is a little warped because I'm a mid-twenties young singleton. The government does little in the way of tax breaks/credits/etc to make my life easier. 

Forgive how bitter this sounds (I don't intend it to be, I'm curious more than anything) but I pay quite considerably sums of money to the government in taxes, duties and the such like.

My Dad's mate is good friends with Steven; they often catch up and play golf, and live close in Liverpool. Having heard of our holiday to the UK, he organised a meet, which was incredible. I'll try to sum it up.

He apologised for being 5-10 minutes late; he said ""in England you can't plan anything because of the weather, so if a good day appears everyone goes mental saying BARBECUE!"". He sat down and we talked a bit about the teams upcoming trip to Australia. He said they often do trips to the US and Asia, and this time they sat the team down and said ""we have a surprise"". Everyone was expecting the usual, but then they told them of Australia and everyone was very excited.

Steven told me it will be his first 90 minutes after his surgery. Talking about fitness, Gerrard mentioned playing more last season than ever in his career. He said he'll be signing a one year extension tomorrow (now today). He also said Luis will meet the team there in Melbourne after 3 weeks break. This led to me inquiring his opinion on the situation, and he said he's not convinced he'll stay. He did speak however of his desire for him to stay, as he's key to our Top 4 ambitions. He said the club want to keep him, but they're waiting to see what decision Luis makes. 

I asked his thoughts on the squad and he said CBs are probably sorted; ""I like Toure"". Also that it's not worth selling Skrtel as a replacement will be about 20m which we can't afford or attract. He just needs his confidence back. He said we need a magician on the wing, and if Suarez leaves then one in the middle too. He said we hope to make two big signings in the next 3-5 weeks.

You said 85 per cent comes back to the surface? You obviously don't know what you're talking about, the aim is to return as much fluid to the surface. But that's not relevant anyway, the fluid stays far beneath any aquifers and as stated in the Royal Society report the geology of Britain means any fluid that did leak is not going to be able to flow into any aquifers. 

&gt;The safety of fracking is the subject and pretending that the undeniable exacerbatory effects on CO2 emissions is irrelevant is special pleading if not a cowardly dodge.

We shouldn't be finding new sources of fossil fuels I agree, but that's not relevant to the debate about safety of fracking.

Yay I'm a shill, you've called me that before which is hilarious, different subject though. I'm just sick of the poor science that gets repeated around the fracking debate, it's far too emotional. You've not really demonstrated any knowledge of the process or the industry. Frankly you don't know what you're talking about.

Analogies aside that frack itself does only last a few days, then it's like dealing with a normal gas well. Both engineering practices are mature (fracking has been done-not on such a large scale-for close to a hundred years). 

I am here to refute the poor science around this debate, I am backed up by leading experts who are part of independent panels who have been commissioned by the UK government to investigate fracking.

&gt;In 2001 among every 1000 women aged 15-44 years there were around 70 conceptions; in 2009 there were just over 80.

Well in England the pregnancy rate for females under-18 is 40.5/1000, of which, 49.7% end in abortion. Which give us a birth rate of ~ 20/1000 for under 18s.

Also the under-16 pregnancy rate is 7.8/1000 females, of which, 61.8% lead to abortion, leaving us with 4.8/1000 births.

The type of people that are liable to form mobs are always unhappy with sentencing. Proposals I have heard on the subject from the uninformed:

* Lock them up in one big cell and poke them with pointed sticks through the bars.
* Bring back hanging. I'd pull the lever myself.

Given that the punishments that these geniuses propose will never be adopted by any sane regime and given that their response to the present state of prison is grumbling that it's like a hotel, they've got play-stations in there and everything rather than to form up into lynch mobs as you suggest I think it unlikely that anything more than the deprivation of liberty need be required for the retributive aspect to be satisfied.",0,1373899331,null,0,false,0,cb31sf3,t3_1ic0qx,t1_cb31sf3,t1_cb319o9,null,1430461083,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"I don't think Liverpool have any interest in Alderweirald or Eriksen at this point - if we go for them, it'll be as back-ups. Not necessarily bad ones, but not first-choices.

Any of the other 3 would be great additions, but they all have/will have alternatives to play in the CL, so it's an uphill battle to convince any of them to come here. 

**Edit** Some people don't seem to like this, so I'll elaborate: 

If Alderweirald were amongst our top choices, we'd have moved for him by now. Ajax has already accepted an offer from Norwich and (I think?) one from Leverkusen, so he's on the market and would already at least be in talks with us if we were serious about getting him. Same with Eriksen, it's been over a week since the Mkhitaryan deal died, so we'd have made a move by now, we'd want them on tour if they were near the top of our list. The point I made when our interest was initially talked about is that he'd be very good at maintaining possession in the higher areas, more so than the options we already have, and that's something that can be a massive asset in a system with quick forwards and a lot of players attacking, bringing midfielders and full-backs into the attack. I've since heard that he has problems with his attitude, several people who know the player better than I do have said he hasn't developed as much as he should have because he doesn't work hard enough, and Liverpool apparently aren't convinced he has the right mentality. Would still be an asset, but not one we're prioritising. That's my logic for those two.

For the other 3, Bernard apparently is likely to move to Porto, and while that might not be a certainty it's still a club that will offer him CL football, Portuguese titles and a country where he speaks the language, which is more than we can offer him. Shaqiri is currently at the best team in the world, I don't think Pep would sell him because he seemingly has all the qualities to be a Guardiola player and if he is sold, he'll have opportunities at other clubs currently better than us. I don't know if Higuain still wants to leave Madrid (depends on things behind the scenes) but he'll also have better suitors than us in Italy and England. So there's two players there who are likely to go to CL teams if they leave their clubs, two whom we haven't moved for even though we've been acting quickly in the market and one whom other clubs have made offers for. Doesn't mean none of them will end up at Anfield, but they're not players I'd be expecting to see play for us next season.

[Here's a route](http://goo.gl/maps/OFVkU) I threw together quickly in google maps, presuming you don't want to sit on the M4/M25 for a couple hours. At roughly 6 hours driving, you'll need to leave early and won't arrive until fairly late, especially if you want to stop off along the way. There is decent coastal scenery along the Sussex coast. You may want to stop off at the [Seven Sisters](http://www.sevensisters.org.uk/)/[Beachy Head](http://www.beachyhead.org.uk/), which are possibly nicer (and certainly whiter!) than the White Cliffs of Dover. That route will also take you over Romney Marsh, which is quite nice in it's own way.

As for Dover, you should at least consider checking out [Dover Castle](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/dover-castle/). It has a lot of history, from the Roman lighthouse and Saxon church, past the medieval castle right up to the Second World War tunnels. If you're into shipping, you can watch the ferries and [cruise ships](http://www.doverport.co.uk/?page=Cruises) from the castle grounds (the Admiralty Lookout comes to mind) or alternatively from the [White Cliffs National Trust site](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/white-cliffs-dover/). They have a visitor centre there, and if you want you can take the 4-mile round trip walk to the South Foreland Lighthouse.  
Staying more in Dover itself, there's the [Dover Museum](http://www.dovermuseum.co.uk/) with Bronze-Age boat and the [Roman Painted House](http://theromanpaintedhouse.co.uk/) in the town centre.

You could feasibly take the train direct from Dover, although it doesn't save any time and the car hire places are far more convenient at Ashford International. Note that there is no direct train from Ashford to Heathrow. London termini available from Ashford are St. Pancras (high-speed), Charing Cross/Waterloo East or Victoria depending on route taken. From there, you can either take the tube direct to Heathrow (allow an hour from St. Pancras on the Piccadilly Line) or get yourself to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"Not purely on statistics, no; but I think that solid evidence should hold significantly more weight than what the public thinks, because normal people tend not to understand things as well as they think they do and tend to rely more on emotions and impressions than measurable data and evidence. Either better education about the issues is required - meaning the media will have to stop sensationalising everything - or the government should rely far more on evidence-based chance than it does. Or both, frankly.

Focus groups smacks of vote pandering. The government wants to do what will make them look good and help them at election time, so they get focus groups to tell them what the electorate wants - or think they want - instead of basing change on evidence, measurable data and reliable predictive models, because the latter won't always look good or get them votes.

I do agree the government needs to listen to people, but as I say, people can be ignorant and uninformed about some issues. The government needs to supply appropriate amounts of information, from an independent source, before conducting these focus groups. Focus groups are great for special interest issues - a friend of mine is having some success with using them for her PhD on coastal erosion on a particular stretch of the British coast, where the focus groups tell her what they've been told, what they think of the problem, what they believe the government is doing about it and what they think the government should be doing about it, as well as giving her information on how the coast has changed over, sometimes, a 60 year period since they've lived there. They have a special interest in that their houses are going to fall into the sea at some point and they're worthless now as it is because of that; their lives and livlihoods are at stake, so they have taken it upon themselves to find out what's going on.

But people without a special interest in the topic - people who have never claimed benefits talking about benefit cuts, or people who don't know any immigrants, much less experienced it themselves, parrotting whatever newspaper they read on the subject when they don't know how it effects people who are immigrants or who live in areas of high immigration or are hiring people and getting a lot of immigrant applicants.

That's why focus groups are not always useful: people can be asked their opinion on topics they don't know enough about to form a valid opinion, and this is taken as ""what the electorate thinks"" instead of ""what a white middle class woman thinks of education for disadvantaged city-centre kids"" or whatever.

Actually, that would be great!  Think what things could happen if the NHS IT stuff was open source.  I say this as mostly a Microsoft platform developer shop.

&gt;But the point is they make less of a loss, meaning they don't have to have as much money in the first place, meaning we can have more companies making video games. It's exactly the same with movies.

You don't pay any tax on losses.  They are losses.

&gt;And they all make money, which is the main thing the government cares about.

Wait, so games make money?  Or losses?  The tax reduction only matters if they make profits.

So lets use a really good real world example, crowdsourcing.  There is a game by a certain nameless search giant, which involves people playing live against each other.  They enter 'tags' that describe the picture.  The more common and faster your tags come in, the higher your score.

Obviously this is just how they can get better Image search functionality.

Should that be taxed less?  I mean people use it for fun?  At what point should the tax be lower, for the whole search operation, or just the matching game?  What if the two are the same codebase, running on shared infrastructure.

NS2 has a bunch of non-game features, they have a little SDK.  Should they be taxed for that?

Giving some companies breaks but not others, it's a lot of shit.  If they said its about arts contributing to society, I could kind of see how they justify the lobbying/nepotism.

true,Yurilovescats,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"I'm in the same boat as you in terms of current circumstances, but my view is shaped by my upbringing. My parents divorced and lost a heap-load of cash on a combination of lawyers and having to sell a new house in a collapsing market. My mum, sister and I lived on benefits for about a year and a half while she re-trained. During that time she got a lot of support from the community (a church she'd been a member of for 15 years) who gave her free baby-sitting, clothes and other support. Once she re-trained they also gave her her first job (working as a secretary at the church). 

As it was, we lived in one of the most expensive parts of the country (Surrey) so would probably have been moved away to a cheaper place had the government been allowed to. Not only would that mean my mum wouldn't have got all the support she received, and probably have found it much harder to enter the work force and come off benefits, but I dread to think what would have happened to my sister and I. We were both fairly emotionally vulnerable, and took comfort from our childhood friends - if we'd lost that I don't know what would have happened. Certainly, as it was, we both got good grades at school and went to top universities and are now both tax-payers (she especially is in the higher brackets!) - I could easily imagine being forced to move to a strange place would have negatively affected our grades, lessening our chances to become top-end tax payers in the future.

Now, I understand that this is how benefits are supposed to work, and there are plenty of counter-examples of people who abuse they system.

Sometimes it's hard to appreciate that there's places in this country other than London. You can live in Norwich, Ipswich, Chelmsford, Watford, Slough, MK etc. for a quarter of the price and easily commute into London (if you insist that's where all the jobs are). 

Coupled with not smoking, drinking and generally pissing money up the wall on overpriced designer clothing and the latest technology and you can afford a flat in London. Your current  iPhone 3 works fine, do you really need the latest £500 iPhone? Probably not.. and yet people fork out for them and wonder why they're broke. £7.00 a day on cigarettes, good use of money. Could I make my own lunch? Nah, not bothered – spend £10 a day on Itsu and Pret instead. Again, copious waste of money.

I'm 23 and with a friend I’ve just got the keys to an ex local authority flat 10 minutes from London Bridge. It's in a proper state as it was rented by people who didn't care about it but the price reflected that and I'm doing it up by myself. Bit by bit. It's the indignant self-entitlement when people belief they deserve better without really trying that I hate. I'm surrounded by people at work in heaps of debt and balancing credit cards despite earning more than me and yet they feel sorry for themselves about not being able to afford housing.

&gt;""the US is different from the UK so none of their problems apply because regulated it's perfectly safe""

It **is** different though. Literally, the geology in the UK is different so many of the problems they have with fracture propagation just cannot physically happen here. Combine that with a culture being against heavy regulation and you have the clusterfuck that is American fracking.

&gt;transportation of toxic hydraulic fluid, this will be by truck, so all trucks, all exchanges of fluid, all returned fluid have to not fail—this is not just about a simplistic turning off of a tap once everything is done,

If you actually bothered to look this up you'd find that only a non-toxic fluid can be used in the UK. 

&gt;In the UK, the EA have set out that the only additives that will be permitted are polycrylamide, hydrochloric acid and a biocide. A permit must be obtained under Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 (EPR)/ Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2011. If the activity poses an unacceptable risk to the environment, authorisation will be withheld. It is for the EA/SEPA to decide whether groundwater is present and whether a groundwater activity is taking or will take place; each proposal will be assessed on a site-by-site basis.

Polycylamide is non-toxic and HCL and biocides are regularly used in cooling loops, which are very leaky and pump water vapour (alongside said biocide and HCL) into the atmosphere and have been for years. 

&gt;the clean up process which is different from each well, some evaporate the the water, some hide it in dumps, some put it into rivers or out to sea. I and many people consider this harm by process—the process is a side effect.

Again regulation. It is far far stricter in the UK, the fluid will have to be treated before disposal as per the EA's already strict rules on effluent compositions. 

&gt;You are a random internet pundit suffering intellectual supremacy with no sources or facts accusing me of being ignorant whilst wishing away your opponents argument.

Let's get some sources (which you haven't used). First we have the royal society report.

http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/

Which can be summed up as it's safe with plenty of regulation, fracture propagation is not going to happen, water usage is already managed by the EA but any disposal of waste would need further regulations.

Next lets get a report from the Chartered Institution of Water and
Environmental Management (closer to my specialty).

http://www.ciwem.org.uk/policy-and-international/policy-position-statements/hydraulic-fracturing-%28fracking%29-of-shale-in-the-uk.aspx

The report comes to similar conclusions. Most industry bodies that could be involved in this have also reported the same things. Fracking is safe as long as it's heavily regulated.

&gt;There are two ""people"" on here that are shill like that I have noticed and called out—/u/bragzor[2] [3] [4] and yourself

Well yes, he apparently disagreed with you about Assange, as lots of other people do. But yes he's probably a shill...

&gt;Again you are being sleazy, ""normal"" invokes a sense of safety but we should both know that ""normal"" gas wells are heavily polluting directly and indirectly. This normal gas well just happens to be in the North's back gardens. 

But they're not, gas wells are sealed contained processes, they don't pollute directly or indirectly. In fact any reasonable debate has nothing to do with the removal of the gas because that is frankly the easiest safest part of the whole operation.

The short answer is, there isn't one under the present system.  Since the 2008 collapse, the rate of concentration of wealth has actually accelerated.  Without debt jubilees and radical rethinking about the distribution of rewards, inequality will inevitably increase and violent social breakdown is highly likely in the longer term.  Add to that that the Western middle class is on a long slow decline because of the transfer of technology and skills to the developing world, where the profits have become massively artificially inflated for transnationals by investment of Western taxpayers' money (and this hasn't been all good news for developing nations, as a lot of that investment has been by way of war, destabilisation, regime change, undermining of economies and progressive governments, laying the groundwork for ""globalisation"" and ""free trade"", establishing punitive treaties and indentured servitude at a governmental level, breaking unions, changing labour laws, enclosing commons, seizing land etc. etc.).  They are also rapidly developing markets there, so they will have less dependence on Western markets going forward.

Sorry, that turned into  rant, back to your post!

&gt;at the moment when people are leaving education they enter limbo, it is amazing that an 18 year old is leaving school to go and work in ASDA at min wage, and that is maybe the best they will ever have now.

Yeah, see above, sadly retail and services provided in-country will be the lion's share of employment for most people, regardless of how skilled they become going forward.  There will be a small silver collared class, but it will shrink and the barriers to enter it will increase.  Much skilled work can be outsourced, and they are rolling out mass online education to service many of these niches.

&gt;all that investment made over the years has been rendered worthless, our economy and country is going to take years to come round the bend.

If it ever does.  There's certainly no reason to believe that it will in the medium term.

&gt;we should disavow debts, round up the people we can find who stole all the money and punish them.

Absolutely, but we will do neither without substantial political pressure and an organised left - which we currently don't have.

There's that meme again! And this time as a perfect tautology: ~""things are always safe if safely done"". Human error, financial cutting of corners, and corruption do not exist.

&gt; Let's get some sources (which you haven't used). First we have the royal society report.

In our exchange I was the first to offer a link. Now the Royal Society is a propaganda machine, the clue is in the name, and let's not forget who has the great mining rights in the UK.

&gt; If you actually bothered to look this up you'd find that only a non-toxic fluid can be used in the UK. 

It's sloppy indeed to quote a source and not name it. Remember what I said about honesty?

&gt; Combine that with a culture being against heavy regulation and you have the clusterfuck that is American fracking.

Have you seen the banking sector? Oh yes, you said elsewhere strict regulation only applies to engineering.

Biocide... bio... cide. Homo... homo.. cide. By definition and by process they are toxic.

Did you continue reading to the end?—fracking is unsafe:

* 6. The impacts on amenity are likely to be greater in the UK than other countries where fracking is common practice, as the proximity and density of populations relative to possible UK sites are greater. **Local Authorities should restrict or prevent development in areas of high value or sensitivity with regard to biodiversity, water resources and local communities.**

It's **unsafe**.

&gt; In fact any reasonable debate has nothing to do with the removal of the gas because that is frankly the easiest safest part of the whole operation.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"it depends what they want in its place tbh. Minimum wage is not the only way to skin the cost-of-living cat. Indeed some argue it is too slow to react to changes in the cost of living, hence the discussions emerging around a living wage. Germany, for example, has a system slightly similar to that the UK used to have, which is industry and region-specific minimum wages. This was largely due to the different cost of living between East and West, which is even larger than that between London and its orbit and the North.

For jobs not covered there is a 'moral' wage, which is quite fluid in its meaning but actually often helps courts apply upward pressure on organisations to pay well, although often it means jobs such as hairdressing fall through the cracks. The Social Democrats want Merkel to introduce a comprehensive minimum wage but may still apply it according to sector, much like the old UK system. However one reason why this system was abandoned in the UK was due to collapsing Trade Union support and membership, and the antagonistic rather than supportive relationship between central government and the Unions.

If they felt another system might better tackle issues of unemployment and make sure that people are getting a fairer living wage, then the argument is there to be made.

We do not need him to be good defensively. Maybe we were bad defensivtly because we only had 1 recognized CDM in our squad, Mikel. Lampard and Ramires are not defensive midfielders; both like to make runs forward and when we lose the ball we get fucked on the counter. That has nothing to do with Mata. Anyone who watches Chelsea know that Mata pull the strings in midfield and does a great job at it. It is obvious that Chelsea is lacking when he isn't on the pitch.

That's the point of regulation though, to stop cutting corners and corruption. It works in other sectors of the oil and gas industry, of the chemical industry, hell of everyday life, things like car manufacturing, food consumption, water treatment why wouldn't it work here? Why is fracking the only industry regulation it's not going to work in? 

&gt;Royal Society is a propaganda machine

Hahahaha. I can't believe you actually said that, do you know who the Royal Society are? It is probably the oldest, most prestigious scientific society in the world. If you cannot trust the Royal Society then you cannot trust any scientific or industrial body. 

&gt;It's sloppy indeed to quote a source and not name it. Remember what I said about honesty?

You could have googled the quote? But anyway. It's from [here].(http://www.ciwem.org.uk/policy-and-international/policy-position-statements/hydraulic-fracturing-%28fracking%29-of-shale-in-the-uk.aspx)

&gt;Have you seen the banking sector? Oh yes, you said elsewhere strict regulation only applies to engineering.

We're not talking about the banking sector we're talking about industry. They have nothing to do with each other and that is not at all a relevant point. 

&gt;Biocides

They are already used in any industrial process were large amounts of warm water is present to stop things like legionnaires disease. Any large air conditioning system will have biocides in them, as will industrial cooling systems. They are also used in water treatment for maintenance. It's not a big deal.

That last point, it doesn't say it's unsafe. It says that it shouldn't be done in residential areas or near water sources. These are common restrictions for a lot of industrial processes. Anaerobic digestion (last thing I wrote a detailed report on) ,for example,  must take place at least 50 metres away from a water source and 500 metres away from any sites of special interest. It doesn't mean it's inherently unsafe it's just another part of mitigating risk.

Years of chemical engineering experience has taught us any industrial process should be sited away from people because, if the worst does happen and there is a leak or an explosion, the damage is minimised. It's all about risk management and hazard mitigation.

You're a fucking idiot. 

Okay, here's the rest:

If you have two central midfielders AND a ""number 10"" then that player shouldn't have to track back. The wingers have to because you're playing two central midfielders and no wide midfielders, so a winger that does not track back will leave your fullback exposed, often against two opposition players. Juan Mata is no winger, I agree. But the fact he isn't great at tracking back or defending works to his *advantage* in that he isn't tied up when the opposition have the ball and he can position himself to receive the ball where he can deal some damage to the opposing side. 

The idea that you need 11 players who can all press and harry the opposition is idealistic and really only Barca have done it to decent effect. We are not Barcelona. We don't want to be Barcelona.

If Mourinho moves to a 4-3-3, Juan will have a slightly lower impact than from the middle, but the defense will be helped by the 3 midfielders; wingers don't have to track back that often.

true,ViamnotacrookV,null,null,"&gt;The reason that he doesn't play for spains squad is that he does/can not track back effectively and most importantly he is either too slow or unwilling to press.

The reason he doesn't play for Spain is because Spain is pretty set in there ways. If they weren't Pedro would never start for them.

&gt;When he played as a #10 under rafa he made our pivot look horrible and if it wasn't for ramires covering so much ground it would have been worse.

When he played as a #10 under rafa our pivot was shit. It's not like if we put Oscar/Hazard/etc there suddenly our pivot would become better. 

I'd be willing to bet any amount that Mourinho will play the 4-3-3 with a 2-1 midfield trio, such as:

       Mata
    MvG    Oscar

Press and counter, which is what this trio offers. If we need defensive work, sub out Mata move Oscar up bring in Mikel. If we need to attack more, slide mata left move oscar up MvG plays in the CM role shifting to a 1-2 midfield trio. 

Note that this doesn't even include the possibility of bringing in Ramires if we need to stretch the field, or De Bruyne/Moses/etc.

We are a tool box team. Do we have a lot of attacking midfielders? Yes. Do they each do something differently? Yes. 

Do I trust that Mourinho has the tactical nous to figure how who is best for the team. Yes.

What Mata offers going forward in creativity and directness, I think, is worth far more than his defensive lacking.

&gt;Oscar is a huge talent and had to play on the wings a lot because of mata's horrible defense. 

See above note.

&gt;Lastly there's the money. Mata would probably fetch around 35-40 million euros at least

I'd add anywhere from 12-17m to that price tag.

&gt;I think his defensive inability is too large to ignore

I think his defensive inability at winning balls is too large to ignore, but the nice part of the 4-3-3, again see note above, is that if the wingers track back it's all about crowding out and pressure. Juan doesn't need to win balls if he can force errant passes.

Don't get me wrong, he's a great player, but he lacks the fluidity that our team calls for, and would displace a very talented young striker in the form of Daniel Sturridge who is much better suited to our system because of his versatility. Again, I am in favor of more depth at striker, but not at the sake of getting an overpriced player who isn't ideal for the system.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"Prepare for a swear-fest. 

I had a really shitty dream last night, a recurring one which seems to arise in certain situations, and therefore I woke up in a foul mood. 

Waking up at 5.30am was fun after getting to sleep at 1.30am. 

I then wore a favourite dress to work but managed to cover it with stupid water marks by using Fabreeze on it just before I left.  Apparently I didn’t get the girl memo which says you’re not allowed to get this fabric wet. 

Stupid hold-ups did nothing of the sort and I was about half an inch away from being extremely humiliated when I went out at lunchtime. 

The woman that I share an office with irritated the hell out of me: here’s the dress convo with my boss ‘oh, but it doesn’t look bad, in fact it looks like a design feature of the dress’, office-lady ‘oh no, it really doesn’t, it looks like someone has just splashed you all over with something.’ Well, no shit. Later on she asked me what a rash was behind my ear. It’s not a fucking rash, it’s my skin, I have sensitive skin, sometimes it itches and I get barely noticeable red marks, unless you’re closely scrutinising me, which she does, seemingly all the time, as I can’t even look at a dress without her commenting ‘oh, you’re looking at Reiss?.’  And then she did something so terribly insensitive this afternoon that it beggars belief, and I’m fuming with her. 

She then proceeded to throw around a billion questions at not one but two work colleagues of ours during ‘friendly’ chats, which suggests to me that she’s not the kind-hearted person I had originally thought, she’s just fucking nosy. The way she shoots them off is quite incredible really. 

I’m nearly out of Mac and the new one hasn’t arrived yet. Can’t wait to see what office lady (let’s call her OL from now) has to say about my face if I have to resort to my cheap emergency backup.  She’s already said ‘I haven’t seen you do any touch-ups today, have you just given up?.’ My god, just how much do you watch me woman? 

There are children playing right outside my front door.  Why? 

My office was hotter than satan’s nutsack.

There were no nice dresses to buy on the way home to alleviate my foul mood. 

I’ve just had a text from my most recent ex, who I told never to contact me again back in April. It’s made me simultaneously sad and angry. 

Now let’s look at the good things. 

The clouds were really pretty today.

It seems my friend completely forgot about the outdoor play we were meant to be at, so I got away with that, phew. 

After melting at home for a week I’ve just realised a heater I bought in deepest winter also has a fan function on it, so even though it costs a fortune to run, I am no longer melting in my flat, and mornings will be easier as a result.

People still liked the (stained) dress and a dry cleaner may be able to make it all better. 

My boss is forever adorable.

My lovely colleague really liked her gifts and appreciated the thoughtfulness. 

I have booze and The Red Lion.

It is a reference to the Hannibal Lectar books, movies and the new Tv show. 

In the new Tv show (which by the way is the best new show on Tv) Will Graham is a character who is haunted by antlers and a moose but mainly antlers, he sees them everywhere. It is his fear (+spoiler) that has manifested itself into that animal because there is a cannibal on the loose (Hannibal Lectar) who just so happens to be his psychiatrist and no one knows it. Some murders also happen around the antlers and episodes end with Hannibal consuming humans and cooking them for unsuspecting people who enjoy it and praise him for his talents (Like Suarez who plays great football and is admired yet has this dark secret).

So for someone who watches the show, movies or has read the books it is like a matching storyline. 

- Will Graham is Ivanovic, haunted by a cannibal who has manifested himself into an animal with antlers (who later turns out to be the cannibal) Ivanovic is making antlers in this picture.

- Hazard is Suarez. The cannibal people admire at times but he has a dark dark secret that he likes to eat humans. Hazard also makes the Suarez face in the picture further confirming this.

- Suarez is a talented guy in his field who is out in the open and is popular/undoubtedly good but no one knows his secret that his future is that mask and a jail.

&gt;The implementation of the JSA itself was seen as a response to the case of Binyam Mohammed, a British citizen who was detained at the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay for years without trial.

&gt;**Under the new regime, courts no longer have these powers and the government will effectively be in a position to ensure that material considered secret will remain so.** In any case in which it is deemed that national security will be adversely affected, the courts will be able to legitimise the withholding of that information by the government from the public.

You can dilute ID into different specialties. For example some can specialise in furniture, gardening, automotive, etc. I would like to specialise in automotive design though I'd be more than content working for Sony. 

Industrial design also lends itself to art in a physical form medium. They can create timeless icons or art installations. You may be familiar with [Philippe Starcks juicer](http://common.csnstores.com/common/products/AAS/AAS1030_a.jpg) or [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich's Barcelona chair.](http://uncrate.com/p/barcelona-chair.jpg).

One of my favourite aspects of ID is design emotion or also known as design psychology. This is designing the attachment you have to a product. One of the most obvious being Apple products. Every light you see, every hue, finish, line, curve, material, noise and duration was designed so you love it. Colours have a deep psychology that companies use to reinforce their logo. I don't get to use it at all with my current job, I'm closer to an engineer than ID thought I am still designing stuff. Everything I do is for use internal and doesn't need to take into consideration appearance or human factors really. Form follows function.

Hope this was somewhat interesting!  

Edit: I should also mention that ID people need to have a keen eye for dimensions and so on. Spot things that people normally miss. I noticed my contacts had changed thickness by 0.2 and changed from the tiniest change from blue.

&gt;They don't have a clue what they're talking about

Precisely why when the assistant was hovering around, I told her I did not require any assistance, then went PC to PC and mentally chalked up the specs against the other computers and chose what best suited my needs.

&gt;and if anything goes wrong, their customer service completely sucks arse.

I've been fixing my own computers since I was 11, apart from catastrophic hardware failures, I've sorted everything out myself. So nerr.

true,Swooshington,1953,,"Depends on the fitness of some players. I believe Essien can really do a job as a holding midfielder, and even if he isn't as dynamic as he was before or has lost some pace, let the guy just sit. He is still able to throw around a crunching tackle now and then, and would provide a brilliant option in a 4-5-1. Combine him with Ramires, who does have the engine and dynamic edge and can burst from midfield, or Oscar/de Bruyne, whose range of passing would tear teams apart, or Mikel, who can hold and break up play, realistically we would have a midfield that can take any game by the scruff of the neck. Also I think he would be a better defensive midfielder than Mikel, so if we play a 4-3-3 Essien would allow more freedom for the other two that are paired in there with him.

Either way, in each position we have a brilliant pairing that offer either attacking or defensive options and would allow us to sit and grind, or go for the jugular.

Have you seen how many people die each year? 2k dead, 20k seriously injured, 300k injured in total—the car despite all the regulation is unsafe.

&gt;  food consumption

Horse burger anyone? Pesticide sandwich? Here have some obesity on toast! Your style of argument is poor to dishonest. Regulation is apparently needed to make this unsafe operation safe, but I'm not allowed to cite the many examples regulation fails because we are ""talking about industry"". Regulation is very often lobbied away, like weight and speed restrictions on HGVs. Also I'll quote myself from earlier: human error and corruption.

&gt; [During fracking operations direct emissions of gas can come from the wells, as well as the emissions from the large number of on-site diesel powered engines required during the drilling and operation of shale gas wells [xxvii]. These emissions combined with other natural (biogenic) and anthropogenic emissions in the region can together form ozone, other photochemical oxidants, and particles in the atmosphere. High concentrations of ozone and other oxidants in the atmosphere near the ground are of concern because of the adverse effects on human health and damage to vegetation, while particles impact on human health [xxviii]. There are few studies on the quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced from fracking which have the ability to create photochemical smog under certain conditions. Also, if these are later flared then this will increase NOx emissions. More research is needed here.](http://www.ciwem.org.uk/policy-and-international/policy-position-statements/hydraulic-fracturing-%28fracking%29-of-shale-in-the-uk.aspx)

So, we are going to burn a hell of a lot of fossil fuels to get fossil fuels out of the ground, and the parts of the UK that have suffered the greatest damage due to industry are yet again being depreciated for short term gain, but fuck it, let's get fracking! My ultimate position, and it's the correct position, is that we don't know the long term effects of fracking and it is totally wrong to say there is no risk—there will be harm and you want to haggle over how much. We do know it is only a short term gain (at best and the net output is dubious as at least one other redditor has posted) and a project too big to fail.

I don't have direct experience with the EU, but I've incorporated a business in the US--I literally signed one piece of paper with my partners and it was done.

Canada's taking steps to build up their Vancouver startup industry by reforming their immigration policies to allow for business founders to more easily bring in foreign talent, and reforming laws domestically to make it easier to found and get investment for businesses. Maybe this is the reason for the flight of EU founders and developers to Silicon Valley rather than the Silicon Roundabout? Again, I'm not sure about the specifics of doing business in the UK, but, working and Silicon Valley and seeing all the EU devs/studios who've come over here, I can't help but think some sort of startup promotion would be beneficial for Europe to compete with the States in the tech industry.",0,1373918216,null,0,false,0,cb38svt,t3_1ic20n,t1_cb38svt,t1_cb30aqk,null,1430457762,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For example Arsenal are like a money making machine where you sell your good players and try to operate on a profit. Plus they are paying off their debt which is boosting their market value. This does not mean they have more fans or they are a more popular club but it just means that financial value wise they are above Chelsea. This is also down to their success previously which is just starting to go downwards (value wise) while Chelsea's success will only just start to translate onto this list now. You don't get a value boost the day you win a trophy, it takes a long time.

United, Madrid and Barcelona are clubs who have the global fan base which far exceeds most clubs hence the value.

Chelsea, City, PSG etcetera are business wise not good and this is a business value list not a club popularity or success list. We spend a lot of money, get a lot of debt built up which all causes the value to go down. 

This list is not a representative of clubs operating successfully on the pitch, as long as you are successful you will keep climbing it which we are doing very rapidly, only hindered by our own spending. This is more of a representative of how much the impact of their financial activity is having on the club's name. 

I don't care where we are at the forbes list as long as we keep winning.

Make sure you try to use examples and experiences where you've used certain skills - ie working in a team, computer work, deadlines, and what you've gained from those experiences. 

When I was 16, I got my first job in a little high street shop to bring in some money while I was doing my A-levels. If you can bag yourself a job now, you'll find it a lot easier to get easy work after A-levels and during the uni holidays due to your experience in a working environment and organizing yourself. During my university holidays, I picked up supermarket work really easily with my pre-uni work experience; these places are good for young people to work for as the hours are generally pretty flexible and there's usually extra hours going if you put yourself forward. They'll also likely take you back year after year too.

The holidays are quite a long stretch of time, so don't waste it. You've got the rest of your life to sit around and do nothing, so do something productive and it'll pay off in the long run :)

Voluntary work in hospital (library, chatting with elderly)

Dog walking

So he's not that good anymore... This team will be challenging for the PL and CL titles, and he simply isn't good enough now to start for a team with such aspirations.

&gt;Goals are quite important, you know.

Sure, but Chelsea have plenty of other players who can score or assist, and now that most of them have had a year to gel with each other and in the PL, Lampard scoring won't (or at least shouldn't) be as important in that regard anymore.

&gt;When has he ever been fast?

True, but he seems even slower now. He takes a second longer to make decisions, and it hinders his ability to track back and mark attackers properly.

&gt;Erm, what? Absolute bullshit. Your answer to this perceived poor distribution, by the way, is Ramires? I don't really know what to say to that.

He does tend to randomly give the ball away every once in a while in an attempt to get the ball forward. The reason I like Ramires even though he does the same is because of his speed. He can get back and defend easily and also leak out for counterattacks while Mikel stays back.

&gt;But beyond that, I'm not surprised to see the sentiment of writing off our best ever player on here, largely on nebulous and unquantifiable grounds - spouting the same lazy cliches and received wisdom that get parroted around here ad infinitum.

Well I don't know what him being Chelsea's best ever player has to do with next season, and he's certainly not the best anymore.

As for the cash; yes, this cut could save the government £110 million (although that's an upper bound, the actual saving could be significantly less). But then why not put the caps at £100/£200 and save even more, or abolish them completely? Because those benefits exist for a reason.

Perhaps there are better ways to save that money, or collect more to balance that - as noted elsewhere, this is between 1% and 0.1% of the savings made by increasing the retirement age by 1 year.

The recent top rate tax cut alone cost hundreds of millions of pounds. The latest G4S contracting mess suggests they defrauded the treasury out of some £50m.

1. Unfortunately I didn't ask anything about Rodgers, I should have but as I said earlier was sort of in shock!

2. He said he hopes to play til he's 35 (he signed on today until 35) and said he potentially has 1 or 2 trophies in that time. He did say however that Luis is crucial to that - if we lose him, we are knocked back 3-4 years in that regard which almost puts it out of the picture for a player of his age.

3. He was funny. He said ""some days I'll walk in here and it's full of Liverpool fans, wanting photos, conversations and signatures. Other days I could walk in here and it's full of Everton supporters all looking at me like ""f**k off!"""" He also said that some people see him around the area a fair bit, and joked that they say ""pfft, you again!"", which I highly doubt!

Round my way, which is of course the only area I'm interested in, rental yields are around 3.5 to 5% (with 5 being very rare).  You may think ""not bad considering what I get in a building society"", but even these numbers are misleading as they're based on a fully-let 12-month year.  Once you take, void periods, repairs, agency fees, the opportunity cost of landlord's equity and the landlords time, it really doesn't add up.

Renting works out to be only 50% to 66% the cost of owning a similar property (based on currently available mortgages).

So why is this worse than the bull or bear visions?

Well if the bear vision had come to fruition and there'd been a crash circa 2005 (which, to be fair, there was a real risk of) then it'd be over and done with by now.  The bull vision is that somehow the 10%/year is inevitable in the long-term is viable, this would be nice if true as there'd never be a risk of negative equity for people stretching to afford a home.

However, things didn't crash in 2005; and 10%/year on average is impossible without inflation approaching a similar number.  Let's not forget that the current house prices indexes are showing 1.5-2% year-on-year growth (which is below inflation); and that's despite: record low interest rates, and a government programme of subsidy of mortgages... all that and we only get 2% growth... that's not a good sign despite how many times the Six O'Clock News says it's ""sign of recovery"", it's simply filling a corpse with adrenaline.

So instead we have this stalemate of stubbornly high inflation, but low growth.  It's easy to dismiss inflation, but it makes any kind of real saving difficult, which is bad for anyone who plans on not dying before retirement age... in twenty, thirty, forty years time there's going to be half the population over 65 with no (or very small) pension.  It's not going to be a happy time.  They'll have to make ends meet by selling-up, which of course will put a lid on house prices.

So to summarise: we're (by which I mean the whole economy) fucked regardless.  And all of it, ALL OF IT, is due to people clinging on to this house prices = wealth myth.",0,1373922847,null,0,false,0,cb3an5m,t3_1icp50,t1_cb3an5m,t1_cb35ywf,null,1430456895,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"£350 is a lot. But welfare spending has been decreasing as a percentage of GDP, and increasing below the rate of inflation for a few years now, so the various benefits are already being cut; and given how dramatic these have been in some areas, one has to assume that those few people getting £350 a week must be doing so for a reason (whatever that is).

The pension age is currently being increased by 1 year, from 65-66. That's happening by 2020, so I'm not sure that counts as ""several times."" Further increases to 67 and 68 are planned in 2034-36 and 2044-46 respectively. The biggest recent change in state pension age has been for women, which is being equalised with men (60-65), but that's been going on since the mid-90s, and is part of an inequality/discrimination thing, rather than public-spending cuts drive.

As an aside, pension spending has been increasing (in absolute terms, compared with inflation, and as a percentage of GDP) since the mid-2000s.

Yes, thousands (more like millions) have lost jobs and had pay cuts over the last few years. But it doesn't seem that the Government is doing anything to help that (if anything, making it worse); the promise of cuts avoiding a recession was proved to be a lie, and (with the exception of 2012-13) we've seen public spending increases year on year (and predicted through till at least 2018). The Government seems to be spending more and more, but with less of it going to poorer people (wealth inequality increasing, both in terms of age and actual wealth). These cuts aren't necessary, or about fairness, but are ideological on the part of the Government - shifting money from one set of people to another...

But anyway, as mentioned, people on benefits are not immune to the ""reality"" that many other people are facing (again, not everyone - the median income of people over 65 has gone up 10-12% since 2008; some people are doing very well for themselves) - cuts are already happening and have been for several years.

But this isn't a cut, this is a cap. And again, if people are hitting this cap, there must be a reason for it - somehow the various existing metrics for calculating benefits (even after the cuts) say these people should be getting £350+. Maybe that means the metric is broken, but surely the solution to that is to fix the metric, rather than simply impose an arbitrary cap?

As for being better, I'm reasonably certain that most people receiving benefits don't get to put the money into their bank accounts and spend it on luxuries any more than working folk do with their income (although... most people on benefits *are* working folk) - many benefits end up going straight to a third party (such as a landlord).",0,1373923071,null,0,false,0,cb3aqap,t3_1iblbh,t1_cb3aqap,t1_cb39h84,null,1430456853,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Imson,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Im not effected by this cap, but I am effect by a lot of the other changes that have been made. I already had to spend a lot of my savings on moving from a 1 bed flat due to the cut backs in housing benefit. I don't drive and I used to live in the city center for the easy access to public transport. I now live in a shit hole with limited choice about where I can work. 

In principle, im not against the idea of adding controls like the ones this cap is meant to enforce. Stoping couples from popping out endless numbers of children at the expense of the tax payer for example. That would be great. But wouldn't there be more specific controls to stop that? Rather than a blanket attack across the whole benefit system? Consider those that live in areas like London, what are they going to do about this cap? Their housing costs are much higher and if you ask me (which you didn't) I think this cap has much more to do with that than anything else. It already be established that this cap wont save any real money (less than 1/10 of a percent from the budget?).

And if that doesn't concern you let me tell you something else. Job seekers are asked to use the Job Centers (JC) own website to look for jobs, which records and monitors what they do. They are also asked to give advisers at the JC to access to their history. This isn't part of the agreement, but they try to force it on to you and most people don't know their rights so they get away with it. But they are still trying to get it written into the job seekers agreement that you must use this and you must give them access to your data (illegal but they are still trying). Now, I worked at a JC that was trialing electric signing pads (Where a computer verifies you signature).... Are you starting to see a pattern form? 

A computer takes your signature - verifies who you are - checks you job search - decides weather you should receive your benefit or not. No human interaction. But what about the advisers, the people that help you look for jobs and help people write CVs? Well, that's already covered... private companies. Yes they already have them in place, currently being used for job seekers that have been claiming for a year or more. Currently. 

They treat people like utter shit, their only goal is to get you in to a job. They get paid for each person that finds a job while on their books. So they cherry pick people that are easy to get jobs for. Anyone else and they don't want to know you.

I only know this because i worked for the CJ while this was all going on.

....Shit, sorry for the rant.

Processes are inherently unsafe, most of them require high temperatures and pressures to work, it's the regulation and engineering that make them safe. Why you are OK with a chemical plant distilling hydrocarbons but not OK with fracking is just odd.

&gt;So, we are going to burn a hell of a lot of fossil fuels to get fossil fuels out of the ground

That's called flaring. Flaring happens everywhere that volatile hydrocarbons are present because it's cheaper, safer and more environmentally friendly to burn them rather than capture and store them. It happens anywhere hydrocarbons are used. 

Long term risks for fracking are neglible, it's the short term risks that are problematic but are easy to mitigate, it's when the actual fracking process is occuring (inputting and removing the fluid) is the main danger, which is mitigated by good well design and proper inspection. 

&gt; We do know it is only a short term gain (at best and the net output is dubious as at least one other redditor has posted) and a project too big to fail. I can only hope you live near one of these wells.

I agree with you, we shouldn't be searching for another source of fossil fuels and should be looking for other methods of energy production.

Having re-read your replies to me, as well as many you made in that thread, you have laughable replies which seem as more of an attack on one's footballing know-how, rather than actual statistical offerings. This is why I didn't reply in full. Merely because someone who doesn't rate Rooney over most of the England squad is fairly moronic IMO.

Your only actual point was that he is wasteful, which stats suggest otherwise. Back up your opinions with interesting analyses of the game, and I'll listen. Until then, you've been appropriately tagged.

These same issues have been rehashed more or less every year since the end of the troubles. This is actually relatively tame. As the riots and protests surrounding this issue precede the recession I don't think we can blame it at all.

Their problem is that they see themselves as under attack at every stage of the peace process. That every compromise involves the nationalists gaining ground and them losing ground. They're angry and frustrated. They compare today with how things used to be, and only see losses for themselves. 

Let's take the marches. Used to be they could march anywhere, play whatever songs they like, and generally act like as big a bunch of dicks as they liked. The RUC would enforce whatever they decided they wanted to do. The result was that for large parts of the country nationalists would be essentially under house arrest while the marches marched past their homes playing songs about the parts of the history of Ireland that the orange order likes. Now, the parades commission has to listen to both sides and tries to strike some reasonable balance of interests. A task that obvious results in nobody being really happy. Their rulings are pretty tame in my opinion, I would like to see them take much harsher steps. Right now they just ban the most offensive actions on the part of the orange order, and only in some areas where it might give extra offense. In the specific case of the ruling that angered the loyalists a few days ago, they were permitted to march down the road once, but not twice. A fairly reasonable compromise I would say, and insult they would say. They see this only as them losing ground, again.

They're not entirely wrong, they started with complete power and we started with none.

George III was in very poor physical and mental health for the latter part of his life, so George IV (his son, and heir) became regent. There was a big debate in parliament about this though, as some, including the Prime Minister, thought that Parliament had the right to decide who would be the regent. Any way, it was all formalised over the years and the Regency Act 1937 is still in force.

The main takeaway for proponents of JSA is that it allows more justice to be done. The Goverment has been known to not bring a case to trial for fear of disclosing evidence but CMP means that they don't have this fear anymore. It does of course fly in the face of the principles of natural justice but pragmatically it means more cases can be heard. My constitutional law professor gave the example of families of people killed in British controlled Iraq, the Al Rawi case (I think).

true,[deleted],null,null,"I like the idea, but as others have said, in reality it wouldn't work.

Personally I was kind of okay with ignoring their existence, but the official statement they released about the Twelfth was ridiculous.

First they claim that the violence in Woodvale was entirely the police's fault because they were only throwing stones at the police and the police used water cannons and plastic bullets ""without warning"" (which in itself, I doubt, but if they don't take the water cannon van hooking up to fire hydrants and the police preparing it to fire, including shouting about it as warning then whatever). Then, at the end, they basically bitch about the fact that the police had so many officers but couldn't control the violence. 

So they're annoyed at the police cracking down on violence (throwing stones and presumably the start of all that jumping on the landrovers and punching riot shields), but also claim the police aren't doing enough to stop it? That's just stupid. No, the police won't be perfect, but from all the footage I've seen of this weekend (PSNI or otherwise), they actually did a remarkably good job in a situation where they were having *bombs* thrown at them and had many officers injured.

Also, all the problems they have with the parades commission and calling for it to be eradicated and calling it ""vindictive republicanism"" is *ridiculous*. The whole point was to have a fair organisation that would try to help all parades go off peacefully without going through sensitive areas. They're still allowing them to march, just in areas they'll be welcomed and celebrated. But no, that's not okay because they don't like it and therefore it's nationalists ganging up and ""destroying British culture"".

I'm neither nationalist nor loyalist, and I've only got back to Belfast after four years in Scotland (and had two years in Dublin before that), but jesus, the OO just seem to be blaming whoever they can for stupid things and deciding that they're doing their jobs perfectly and no one else is.

true,drwormtmbg,flair5,,"Ok.  So, the basic idea was that I have no idea if either of our strikers are going to show up to any games this season, physically, or on the pitch, and we've only made one huge transfer in.  

I love Paulinho as a player, and am really excited to see him join our club, but I'm not sure that he offers all that much more creativity going forward than Moussa Dembélé.  Yet, I constantly see people here suggesting the extremely physical 4-3-3 with him, Moussa, and Sandro starting.  Which in some big games, especially against teams like Chelsea, I could see this working quite well.  However, I'm having trouble finding any creativity to break down a more defensive team, who will launch it over our midfield, like West Ham.

Until, one day I'm standing in the shower, drinking a beer after getting destroyed by my roommate in FIFA many times.  When it hit me.  Lewis Holtby is fast, has boundless amounts of energy, has great energy, and beautiful vision.  AVB should play him as a false 9, in front of the beautiful, beastly midfield.

I know that sounds ridiculous.  But, think about the space that he can create for Lennon and Bale to get in behind Lewis, as he circles the CB's, and drops lower than Moussa, with Moussa dribbling past confused midfielders.  

I woke up today, saw the Holtby thread, but was so excited I had to try it out on FIFA13.  It was extremely useful against the Chelsea and Arsenal, AI on semi-pro.  So, I tried it out online.  I'm haven't played much, in a while since my XBOX was OOC.  But, I won 4 straight games, won the lowest division and got promoted.

Anyways, AVB if you read this, try it out.  Maybe, just on the training ground, but if you try it in a real game, it will work, and then I want a job.",0,1373952522,null,0,false,0,cb3kvtw,t3_1ie78p,t1_cb3kvtw,t3_1ie78p,null,1430451994,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16

You've literally just made that up. I'm fairly certain the money helps. If Sturridge or Coutinho had received offers from CL sides, with higher wages, even though they might not have been playing regularly, do you think they'd have still joined?

&gt;Do you think Gareth Barry, James Milner, Carlos Tevez, Sergio Aguero, Joleon Lescott, Vincent Kompany and all the boys who went to Chelsea (I don't want to list their names too) just did it for the paycheck?

Yes and no, as it was obvious with the amount of spending power those clubs possessed that success was inevitable. LFC can't offer that.

Now if we were owned by billionaires then it would be a different story.

The use of closed material procedure (CMP) and special advocates brings the system in line with Article 6 Right to a fair trial of the ECHR. This has been the case since 2004 when suspected terrorists were subjected to indefinite detention without charge. When the Belmarsh case came to the European Court of Human Rights it suggested that the UK look at the Canadian model. This brought about special advocates whose use was upheld by Strasbourg in 2009 when the Belmarsh detainees appealed again.

What special advocates do is discuss with their party; receive the closed evidence and then are removed from any subsequent communication; attempt to move as much closed evidence into the open evidence by proving it to be in the public domain; and represent the party in closed session. Some of them have stated that they aren't effective but all the evidence says the opposite, for example the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, David Anderson QC.

It just doesn't seem too convincing to do something in secret (that just so happens to be in your favour), and them come forward and tell everyone ""It's working great for everyone else, too! Honest!""

&gt;It does of course fly in the face of the principles of natural justice but pragmatically it means more cases can be heard.

So... it allows more cases to be heard, because certain parties won't be so worried about needlessly disclosing information they'd rather keep a secret, in such a case where the charges don't stick?
