I almost tried to correct you but then had to actually take a moment and think about it and now I get it.

You get 12 regenerations in a regeneration cycle for 13 Doctors as Hartnell was born not regenerated. So Smith as the 13th ""Doctor"" regenerates an burns off the first regeneration of the new cycle leaving only 11 regenerations and Capaldi is the first of 12 new Doctors.

It's ""rape"" in all but legal definition. Quoting semantics does not strengthen your argument.

I am however somewhat dumbfounded by the article, since it repeats acts that I have been successfully convicting people for for a decade. ""Orders to prevent contact""? What, like restraining orders or court orders, or prevention from harassment orders, or family law act orders?

Utter fluff. A 75% conviction rate is phenomenally high. In fact, I'd say that once through the doors of the CPS, things err rather too far towards the presumption of guilt. I've seen it myself in uncontested cases.

What needs to be done is put support in place so that victims get meaningful help when they need it.

true,maitrevee,1986,Petr Cech,"45+2
Good combination by the Reds gets Agger in space but he can't pick out a man with his cross.

45+1
Sterling is penalised for pulling back Willian.

45
Rodgers will be glad to get his team in at half-time here as Luiz is penalised for a foul on Coutinho.

44
Johnson has a go from long range but his effort is well, well wide.

43
This half has absolutely flown by. Got a brief break in play as Sakho is down

41
Johnson finds Sterling whose centre is half cut out but falls to Allen who strikes it well but it's palmed away by Cech. Best opening for the visitors since they took the lead.

*Luiz puts the ball out so Hazard can receive treatment. The Belgian claims he caught an elbow to the face from Johnson - but at the worst it was a nudge with the arm. Still enough for the England full-back to pick up a caution though.*

36
Liverpool need to dig in here as they are in danger of being over-run. Willian, Oscar and Hazard have looked a threat every time they go forward.

*GOAL CHELSEA: Eto'o puts the Blues ahead from close range after good work by Oscar who gets a cross through Sakho's legs. Mignolet should have done better there. It was a tame shot.*

34
Great trickery by Hazard but he can't quite pick out a blue shirt in the area. The Belgian has been a handful in the first period.

33
Sterling finds space and tries to chip the giant Cech but his effort is tame and is easily gathered by the Chelsea keeper.

32
Oscar and Willian look to combine but Agger is alert to the danger.

*Ivanovic can't continue and makes way for Cole who will slot in at left back with Azpilicueta moving across to the right.*

29
Mistake by Henderson almost lets in Oscar but the midfielder tidies up his own error.

28
Ivanovic is back on - but is still grimacing.

27
Treatment for Ivanovic as the Serb overstretches in the challenge. Ashley Cole is warming up as this could be trouble for the big defender.

25
Great tackle by Cahill to deny Allen. He had to get that one right or it was a penalty and a red card.

24
Space opens up for Luiz after good work by Willian but the Brazilian skies his shot horribly high and wide.

21
Suarez is struggling to get a foothold in the game and hands possession to Luiz. Chelsea still bossing this contest.

19
Game being played at a frantic pace. Coutinho is felled by Luiz as Liverpool look to hit back.

*GOAL CHELSEA: Superb right-footed equaliser from Hazard as he gets the break of the ball from Oscar's misplaced pass and bends the ball beyond Mignolet. Can't say it's not deserved.*

Agger hands off Hazard at the expense of a free-kick. The makeshift left back may be in for a tricky afternoon.

15
Coutinho looks to find Suarez on the charge but Ivanovic is equal to the challenge.

14
Hazard is angry as he fails to get a corner with a reverse pass to Willian - but he's probably more cross he did not try a shot himself.

13
Coutinho looks to spring the Chelsea offside trap but is flagged. Looked a tight one.

12
What a save from Mignolet. Lampard lets fly from 25 yards with a dipping right-footer but the Liverpool keeper turns the ball over with his right arm at full stretch. Superb stuff.

11
Hazard goes down in the box but went to ground far too easily. Webb is having none of it - and neither is Sky Sports' Gary Neville who feels it was no foul. Mourinho is furious but there was minimal - if any - contact.

10
Oscar breaks forward but is crowded out by Skrtel and Agger.

9
Now Johnson is clipped by Willian as Liverpool look to play the ball across midfield.

7
Willian bundled over as Chelsea seek to get back into things quickly. Lampard floats in the free-kick which finds Cahill but he heads wide.

4
So nearly an immediate response as Hazard bears down on goal but Mignolet is alert to deny him.

*GOAL LIVERPOOL: Skrtel gets on the end of Coutinho's free-kick as Suarez gets the better of Ivanovic in a goalmouth scramble. What a start for the Reds.*

2
Early word for Eto'o from Howard Webb as he clatters into Jordan Henderson. Lucky to escape a yellow there.

1
And we're underway at Stamford Bridge. Agger starting at left back this afternoon. Interesting to see if Chelsea target the Dane.

true,bairy,null,null,"Over the last few months I've been touring birmingham parks, canals and walkways, mostly on the south of Birmingham.

The nicest ones, imo: Birmingham to University along the worcester canal, starting near Sealife Centre. About 2.5 miles, partly running alongside the railway. You can go all the way down to Kings Norton which is around 6-7 miles. Except for one spot between Five Ways and University, there isn't too much room to stop and draw.

Bournville Park. It's really small, but pretty nice. Not too busy. In that area I'm almost certain you'll be left alone to draw. 11 and 84 busses run along it.

Highbury Park, specifically the duck pond. 50 bus from town. Huge park that's got a fair few trees and a slight foresty area. Was practically deserted when I went in October. Duck pond has benches and plenty of space to draw. Kings Heath park is next to it, isn't quite as scenic but still has a couple of areas where you can perch down.

Lickey Hills is a great place to visit but hard to get to by bus. The 98 from city center will get you there. Jump off near Cofton Park. Now there are three hills - two physical hills. Beacon Hill is to the west and requires a 2 mile walk around Rose Hill to Monument Lane, but it's a slight incline around to the car park. The hill to the north west is Rednal hill and it's a very very sharp climb but in my opinion a much better view. Beacon hill has benches, Rednal Hill doesn't. If you go to Rednal hill, climb from Eachway Lane and descend that way too - don't descent any other side of the hill or you will fall over and break your face - I know from experience. Also Cofton Park is quite nice though nothing spectacular.

Pinfields Woods is south of Lickey Hills. It's some woods with some sharp inclines. There are a couple of clearings where you could sit and draw or paint. Best approach is Barnt Green Station then a 10 minute walk up a fairly steady and slightly steep incline. There's a visitor centre about a mile north in the woods.

Manor Park Farm is a hidden gem in the city. 61, 62, 64 down Bristol Road from city centre. It's mostly fields and stuff, but has a large very pretty pond. It also has a stream running through it.

Edgbaston reservoir is a very large area with decent views of the city centre buildings. It's not hugely varied, it is basically just a big plonk of water. But it might be worth a look while passing.

My last recommedation is a hill in Weoley Castle. Jervoise Road is at the top, Alwold Road is at the bottom. Follow Somery Road from the north down and straight up the hill. The views are spectacular and I'm pretty sure no one would care if you sat down and started drawing. No benches though.

You may find this map useful. It's got all bus routes around the city. Note that it includes busses from companies other than national express so make sure your pass is valid.

It's always bitter sweet, not knowing what's coming, and missing what you've lost.  Your first Doctor will always remain with you, kinda like a basic imprint of the show, it's kinda cool.  But as time goes on, you'll find trepidation of the 'next doctor' but also a kind of excitement to see what comes next.

It tends (at least for me) to cycle for each regeneration.  I wonder if the next will be as good as the last, hope for something different (because being different in this case is good, because there is less to compare to what you've known). 

Now, I simply decide that I'm going to give the next Doctor a chance, let them find themselves within the roll, and see how it goes.  So far, I haven't been disappointed. 

The emotional roller coaster, is still there, but consider it more of an epic change that allows a show, from which your favourite Doctor is a part of the foundation, to continue.

Secondly, plenty of people's approach to living on benefits, which should be changed.

Thirdly, EU immigration contributed to UK's economy. It's the immigration from outside of EU which is a problem (people coming from third world countries, where population there is just massive) but at the same time it is way higher than immigration from EU but that isn't a big deal for politicians, not sure why.

2. Their relationship quite seems like the same as the doctor and River. Maybe they talk about River in 3rd person, because they want to prevent to Clara find out (in that scene she was there). And the doctor also talks about his past selves mostly in 3rd person.
What makes you think that they played a charade when they were alone? They know each other sooo...

3. In NoTD she hinted that there is something odd, because how can River have a conection with Clara if the Doctor is gone? Rivers answer: Spoilers. Impliing that they will meet in some form in her future.
It is also possible that River/Tascha IS the mainframe and that body is just some android thing or something like that.

4. The hints that can be refuted are just to coincidental. 

Lem/Mel: Moffat already did something like this with her with the Melody/Song thing)

Psychopath: Why this exact word? in that situation they just could have said something else for the same thing, buit they decided to choose this, which is used many time before to describe River.

Piloting the Tardis: For her she said, it was always easy to fly the Tardis.....like River. Everyone else should have problems at least in the beginning.

What does? Your posts? BR's reason for playing Skrtel is his return to form. He is still far too error prone for me. If your argument held any weight you could maybe answer why Chelsea are doing dine with 2 right footed CB's, as are Man City, as are Arsenal.

Ade linked up very well up top.  Should have had a goal, but he earned the penalty.  Very good match overall from him.

Soldado played well enough.  Should have had one from open play, but hit it straight at the keeper.  Well taken penalty.

Lennon was very dangerous on the wing.  Terrorized the left back and put in some good balls.  Very nice finish on his goal.

Eriksen was also good.  drifted in dangerously and linked up very well with Ade.

Mousa and Paulinho I put together because they did such a good job of owning the midfield with help from Eriksen and Ade dropping deep.  Mousa's goal was very nice, and it was unfortunate Paulinho had to come off injured.

Defense was great as a unit.  Daws was solid, and Chiriches looked much more confident than he did last time out.  Fullbacks performed above expectations.  Naughton showed he's still a solid option at RB, and Zeki looked good in his full match at LB.

Hugo didn't have much to do, but did it well.

Capoue shored up the midfield well enough when he came on, but didn't really have much to do.

Lamela looked confident when on the pitch, wish he'd been able to play more than 20 minutes when we weren't looking for more goals for much of his time.

true,heyyo129,lfc99,,"Squad depth is clearly a massive problem. We need competition for Joe Allen's place, Glen Johnson's place and replacements pretty much everywhere for injuries.

Our left hand side was so weak today, with no-one there to rush in forward. Agger looked so uncomfortable doing that. As an LFC side, we like having two defenders who play like attacking wingers, Johnsons, Enriques and more recently Flannos. But there was no one on that left side today, especially after Smith was brought into the left putting Coutinho into the middle. There was no overlap after that.
It's all well and good having a world class player like Suarez up front, and when he got the ball, him, Sterling and Henderson did link up well showing signs of what we did against Citeh last week, but it just wasn't the same. This match was reminiscent of the Arsenal match in my eyes. Our team was on much better form, but we were restricted in terms of playing our full flowing game. Suarez couldn't find any space between the lines and the wingers, and Sterling especially couldn't make any room on the flanks.

We played well, and fought well, but we need to buy players in the two upcoming transfer windows to ensure that over the next two or three seasons, Rodgers can make a realistic challenge for the title. 

I never thought we could win the title, and I wasn't going to form that opinion until after we had played the two main title contenders, Citeh and Chelsea. Now that we have, I think we have to press for this fourth spot by filling in all the gaps in our weak bench.

true,Stratocaster89,lfcflame,,"Terrible terrible performance. 

We suffered from scoring so early, everyone switched off. 

* Rodgers got it wrong playing Agger lb when we have a LB on the bench. Even if Sissokho isnt that great, hes still a LB, and knows the role better than agger. This threw off the entire defence and we lost any sort of discipline. 
This then caused us headaches later on having to play Smith (who was completely out of his depth, and understandably so) mixing up the defence yet again. 

* Glen Johnson, theres no defending you anymore. You dont look arsed, and you're playing shite. He's okay in the middle of the pitch usually, but today he looked his usual(this season) shit self everywhere on the pitch.

* Lucas, very poor. caught out too many times, too many misplaced passes, and too little effort. 

* Hendo, did okay, always trying even if it wasnt coming off. 

* Allen, still think hes a waste of space. He's playing okay lately, but we dont need Allen on the pitch doing the same thing lucas is doing, minus the defensive work. The arguement that he's passing it on for others to do something more creative is bullshit. He's a waste of a player on the pitch when you've got lucas doing the same thing. We dont need two players simply recycling possession.

* Suarez, nothing to do. 
Sterling/ Coutinho, again not much to do, but often making the wrong decisions.



Howard webb. Very poor. Saw both Etoo incidents from 10 yards and made completely the wrong decision each time. Etoo shouldnt have been able to be subbed off, he should have been sent off in the 2nd minute, or in the 2nd half for the numerous fouls, and the penalty incident. Also think we should have had a pen for Terry basically pushing suarez with his arms to get to the ball. You cant do that. 

Summarising, if Rodgers starts Cissokho: when allen gets injured, we dont have to play Smith who was hopeless, we can throw on Alberto and not have to fuck with the formation when we're chasing the game away from home, and playing terribly anyway. 
Players werent up for it today, and the team selection was off.

Hats off to Chelsea though, they pressed hard all game and most of their players put a good shift in. They deserved it. However, if the decisions go our way, we could have easily won that game.

The reason I would choose Eto'o is simple: positioning. Of the three strikers we have, the one with the best positioning and poaching instincts is Eto'o.

In this sense, Eto'o gets to simply drift in and around the box waiting to make that run in case one of our attacking midfielders gets in the mood to pass/cross rather than shoot. 

IMHO, an out-and-out striker would simply confuse the current team in the final third. Do we assist, do we score?

 So we've lost away to two top teams. It's frustrating, because we could have got something from both games, bu it's not a disaster. We've got a run coming up which should see us get a good tun of points (15 from the next 5 is quite realistic), and we can get three points against Man City and Chelsea at home, especially with (hopefully) a fitter squad strengthened with a few new faces after the transfer window.

 The aim this season has always been for the top four, and we're still on course for that. Our title chances are not dead, either, and I don't think any of us would have complained about that at the start of the campaign.

 There are things that we need to work on, but I'm sure BR will address those over the coming weeks.

We definitely don't get confirmation that they have an affiliation with a specific god, I suppose I was just assuming that all religions are affiliated with some sort of gods or goddesses.  How do you imagine a technological afterlife?  I'm not sure I understand that.

I agree that they have a very flirtatious relationship which plays on the two being intellectually similar, but that doesn't necessarily mean River.  He's had other relationships in the past and I'd say it's safe to say he'd probably behave similarly if the other partner were exciting him in the same ways as River had, even if she weren't River.  But why would they need to hide her being River from Clara?  What would be the negative effect of Clara finding out?  Especially when The Doctor was at a point in his relationship with Clara where he was being very open with her.  She had, after all, seen moments from his entire time stream by this point.

I'm still of the opinion that the line, 'Spoilers', in *The Name of The Doctor* was simply River's way of saying a final goodbye without actually saying the words.  She knew how much The Doctor hates endings and her final gift to him was crafting a moment with each telling the other their last goodbyes in a way that made it sound like they were going to see each other again.  She actually demands The Doctor do that for her, then she returns the favor for him.  At least that's how I read that moment.  'Spoilers', was really goodbye.

I'm still not sold on the name similarity, it's odd, but not enough to sway me yet.  As for the use of the word 'psychopath', I do still think that's the strongest indication for a connection.  But, how else would The Doctor clinically describe a woman fighting her own inner madness?  It still seems like a stretch to me, especially considering Tasha's intellect and power (which clearly hints at an intense ambition).  As for the TARDIS, maybe that wasn't the first time Tasha had piloted it.

Lloris - Might as well have taken a nap back there

Naughton - Played well.  Definitely proved that he deserves a backup spot at RB

Dawson - Played well.  And he got a slight touch on that penalty shout.  The commentators sounded foolish saying that that should have been a penalty

Chirches - Great comeback game after that miserable performance on Thursday

Fryers - SCREW AVB for playing Vertonghen and Naughton over there.  Seriously.  Fryers looked very solid and were still dealing with Vertonghen's injury that he picked up playing out wide.  Fryers better be our backup from now on

Eriksen - Pretty mediocre performance.  His lack of consistency on free kicks is aggravating 

Paulinho - Where has this been all season?  Looked like a true brazilian out there and I don't think any of his flair cost us possession.  Hoping that his injury isn't serious and that he keeps playing like that

Dembele - Bossed the midfield.  That goal really begs the question why he doesn't shoot more.  He made that look effortless 

Lennon - He was wasteful at times, but his final product was great.  That goal was a beauty and he should have had an assist to Adebayor

Soldado - I'm kind of starting to lose hope with him.  Penalty was great and the ball he played into Adebayor was class, but man he just looks miserable at times.  Gets pushed off the ball easily and missed another sitter

Adebayor - Looked lively.  That missed opportunity was painful, but he looked good other than that

Capoue - Didn't have to do much, but I can't remember him making any mistakes

Lamela - He has to start.  Put him in the middle if you have to, but he needs to be on the field.  You can just tell he has the ability.  I know that sometimes he gives the ball away, but we need his creativity to break some of the stout defenses

Given Sherwood's decision to stick with a 4-4-2, we clearly needed a more defensive/harder working midfield pair, and Eriksen doesn't really fit that mould. Everyone here has been shouting for a Capoue - Eriksen midfield duo.

But by favouring Paulinho and Dembele in those central roles, we were more defensive, bullish and controlling, and we didn't miss out on some nice trickery from Eriksen, who was excellent, skipping about from the left side. He played the same role that Mata often did for Chelsea, or Cazorla does for Arsenal, popping up in danger zones and connecting the play well. He certainly compensated technically for Dembele and Paulinho's more brutish styles.

Adebayor as well was simply incredible at linking our midfield with our attack. He's so sharp when playing with his back to the goal, giving the ball out wide, or laying Eriksen off, even Lamela when he came on was given a few sharp moves from Ade. I was very impressed.

Points that are hinting against it:

1. Tasha mentions the ""new"" body of the Doctor.


And like I said in my other comment. All these hints can be explained in another way, but seeing the whole picture, it seems quite likely that she is River in some other form.

The thing against it could also be explained in some form later, just as the hints that lead to that theory

In the end i think the main problem us fans have is we create such great head canon for where we think the plot points are going, and when they turn out to be underwhelming next to our head canon then we get mad. It happens in everything e.g Doctor Who, Star Wars prequels etc. It happens.

Who knows maybe one day the most perfect writer/show runner will takeover and do everything right, but you can bet money someone, somewhere will still say there's plot holes, his writing ability is dropping and that he's the worst.

That's very fair of you.

The new manifesto is coming out soon (it's already overdue  but they seem to be holding onto the release date for maximum political expedience), however what they have been keen to do being a party trying to break into the big 3 status quo is to embrace the Internet.  In that sense they use video snap shots a great deal to explain perspectives and arguments, far more than any other party.  

They have a feed on what they feel relative articles,

Okay.  If I illegitimately crossed the line, misread, or misattributed unto yourself, **then I apologise.**  

I got 'it' that the EU Commission and the presidency of the Council had/has been pushing a bellicose line, especially on Syria.  **If you support the concept of the EU but not that particular aspect**, then that is fair enough - and I am sorry.  We might disagree broadly, but I shouldn't throw you under a figurative bus for the whole if you disagree with a certain aspect.

It remains that a certain element want to criticise or misrepresent a non 3rd party alternative to prevent another line of public debate, and encouraging others to jump on that narrative.  Not that I'm now accusing you of doing that, but for a long time any discussion of immigration was met by little more than accusations of either (a) racism, or, when (b) insular isolationism.  Neither is true, and it is a point that has now been forced (eventually) so that more parties are having to address it.

A subtle but important difference. Effectively the latter statement is a response to a claim, rather than a claim itself. The vast majority of atheists in the world are Weak, and probably describe themselves as ""agnostic atheists"" in any case.

Most people who describe themselves as agnostic, but eschew the term atheist, are actually atheists. If you answer the question ""Do you believe in a god or gods?"" with anything other than ""Yes"" then you are an atheist. That includes ""I don't know"" and ""We'll never be able to know"". Whether or not we'll ever know is where the (a)gnosticism comes in.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"MotM Hazard. For the first time, for me, in a while. 

Also for the first time, I found myself correctly predicting Jose's tactics - almost to the man. He still pulled a blinder with Luiz in midfield even after he had said he would never play him there. 

All three attacking mids played exactly as expected. Each of them tracked back and ensured that the supply to Suarez was cut off. Coutinho, Sterling and Henderson could never get a good through ball to Suarez and that is exactly what Jose wanted to do with Luiz in midfield. 

It is becoming increasingly clear that Jose will choose a counterattacking game and Mata will not be a part of his game as long as we don't have a disciplined defense. Only once our defense stops leaking goals from set plays and silly mistakes, is when Mata will be allowed to play a more expansive game. 

Brana going out means more of Azpi at RB, and it means more of Cole at LB. The former is good news, the latter is slightly worrisome. Cole vs Sterling was a butt-clenching match up with Sterling's pace winning against Cole most of the time. Thankfully, Willian kept tracking back and Mikel helped out in the second half, so that threat was mostly quelled. 

Eto'o did what was expected of him. Roamed in and around the box, got into poaching positions and kept the fullbacks occupied. 

Luiz unavailable for Southampton, Lamps injured by thankfully, Ramires is back. Rami + Mikel is likely, especially after Essien horror show in the reverse fixture. 

Webb was Webb, what else.

true,SwingYaGucciRag,lfc12,,"Thank you, I was about to make a post saying this. 

We just lost our last two games and yes, this is the first time under Rodgers that we've lost two PL matches in a row.

**BUT**

We lost to Manchester City at the Etihad where they have been simply unplayable this year, putting 3+ goals past everyone they've played at home with the exception of us and Hull City. We played a brilliant game and in the end, poor officiating and our inability to finish the chances we created meant we gave City the hardest test they've had at the Etihad all while missing Sturridge, Gerrard and Enrique.

And we just lost to Chelsea who are undefeated at home under Jose Mourinho. Yes, West Brom should have broken that record had it not been for the referees fucking them over but that's just a testament to the fact that your chances of beating Chelsea at home under Mourinho are so thin for more reasons than one. We were bossed out of the game for large periods but what do you expect against a Mourinho side at home once they've taken the lead? Once he's taken the lead, Mourinho gets his Tony Pulis on and that's just his play style. We were ravished with injuries and Brendan Rodgers isn't an idiot, no way he threw Brad Smith on (a 19 year old left back who's never played a first team game) at LW and expected him to make an impact. That's a way of telling the owners oi, look here, we need to make some fucking signings in January. Not to mention Webb didn't call a very clear penalty that would have tied the game. 

We have Hull at home next and you can bet we'll go into that match with the understanding that nothing short of a thumping is acceptable. The overreactions I've seen on some places (not here so much but especially Twitter) are unwarranted. Very winnable games at home coming up, we'll be back in the top four in no time, calm your tits ",0,1388341965,null,0,false,0,ceco3w5,t3_1tybo8,t1_ceco3w5,t3_1tybo8,null,1427943381,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

He was only on just over 20k a year and must have spent a good 6-7k on travel.  Now, £20k a year after tax is just under £16k a year.  Take the 6-7k off and you might as well get a job nearer home.  After seven years of this, he finally left.  £49k on travelling over seven years.  Crazy.

this will do a few things for you:

* ensure you like the area before going the full hog
* prove you are at an educational level to do it.
* make it a easier to then get in to uni if that's how you go

foundation years, are a way to easy in to the uni work load and worth considering but obviously adds to the time training.

foundation degrees are good and there are some uni's out there that have a lot of support for students that are older or coming from a weaker/less traditional starting point.

beware that they do effect how the unis mark the full degree and this can put more pressure on the final year, this will depend on each uni so find out.

id advise saving some cash up, to do really well you may need/want to put more hours in which will restrict hours you can work.

also get a part time job wile studying is advisable or get your dad to give you a pay rise as i work that out to £4ph for an 8 hour day which isnt helping you if you go back to education and have less time to work.

the loans and maintenance grants are available and should be taken out to make it easier. yes you pay them back (or some of it) but its like tax and yo will still be way better of then £32 a day, when you are working.

true,pick-a-spot,cnty-england,London,"It's not a surprise that more people in the UK would mean more jobs - more people consuming more goods and services. And these are jobs they are 'taking' in the longterm - jobs they have created with their presence! Thus immigration can have a net benefit for everyone. It is just near impossible to measure.

It would be nice if someone tried to measure this, it would be quite interesting and useful. Your data unfortunately is not an example of this and seems to be hand-picked and simplified to suit your agenda.

For example one problem arises if a higher proportion of immigrants are suited to one industry rather then others. You don't seem to hear middle class people complaining because the competition for 'their' jobs has not increased at the same rate as 'unskilled jobs'.

The working class with less transferable skills seem to be attributed to these complaints; The classic hillbillie southpark 'They jook arr jabzz' stereotype.
Probably because a much higher proportion of immigrants are willing to do their jobs for relatively less money and less complaints so it effects them a lot more then other parts of society.

Like everything there's a sweet spot;   unskilled migrants can enter the labour market and set a new decent equilibrium that employers and workers can both benefit from. too little or too much is a problem

Obviously your figures won't show this, it won't show income inequality increasing- it will just show a rise in GDP. Hurray GDP has increased I guess life is better for everyone.

Uncontrolled geographic immigration is also a negative. Constant tv clips of Slough being surprised by a sudden influx. Their public services can't cope. Schools are over crowded and now they need more specialist teachers to help new children learn english. Your figures don't measure the cost of that.

You also ignored the black market labour force. A Brit would probably report them immediately unless they paid well enough. 

The immigration Panorama documentary showed people building nicer homes back home from money earned in the UK. That is money being earned in the UK but being sent abroad instead of being spent here. How do you measure that? Heard of the money mulitplier effect. Well the UK is being cut out of that benefit.

I sound very anti- immigration but only to combat this silly post. There's pro's and con's, I don't know how they balance out....but don't post carefully selected figures in the guise of being neutral

**The league.**

Despite a few disappointing away games (See Villa et al) it's all going to plan pretty much. We're second, a point off top and scoring goals for fun. I thought we'd be top by now but that was before Arsenal and Liverpool decided they were bored with consistently disappointing their fans and nobody expected that to happen, not even their own fans. 


**The champions league.**

Personally it's been quite successful. Qualification, from a rather easy group in comparison to the previous two years I must stress, was expected. The home performance against Bayern made me hope somebody would knock them out in the last 16, so we could go on and win it and despite the 3-2 win on their turf I still feel the same. In respect of drawing Barcelona, it boils down to what happens in the home game, if we can keep a clean sheet and score a few then we should progress but keeping a clean sheet against Messi and co will prove difficult.

**The Capital One 'Nobody really cares about this until the semi finals' cup.**    

Well, what can I say we have dispatched of Wigan, Newcastle and Leicester with relative ease, scoring 10 and conceding 1 on the way to a semi final tie with West Ham and the prospect of a all Manchester final in February which will be nice.

**Conclusion**

All in all I'd say it's been 9/10 so far and if we sign a good centre back partner for Kompany in January I see us reigning the league crown we surrendered so easily last season, reaching the semi's of the champions league and may be a domestic cup to boot.

true,sweet_nothingz,SO,somalia,"I enjoyed both halves for different reasons; 1st half our closing down was immense, passing and possesion was top notch.Closing down especially from Oscar,Willian,Luiz and Azpi.

  Lamps and Luiz complimented each other very well in the middle of the park, long range passes from both were good for spreading play. Lamps' long range shots were good too.

 Hazard  was sublime today but I found Eto'o a bit quiet in the 1st half, apart from his near post goal he was absent from most build up play. Fair praise to getting the winner though. 

   The best football I've seen from us in terms of chemistry and control since maybe the Hull City game in August.

  With Mikel coming on we played more defensive and the game became scrappy, which was good for us since it meant less service to Suarez. Liverpool were at their most dangerous from set pieces and Sahko coming close was their best chance. 

 Willian's work defensive work rate was imense and hard to miss, needs a bit more going forward as a threat imo. Cech was solid when called upon to save,catch or punch. Which wasn't a lot due to a fantastic display by the defence today, all in all a great way to end the year.

Don't just hang out with Americans. So many of my American flatmates just hung out with other Americans and complained about all the things that they couldn't do/get that they could in America.

They claim they don't fit in with the Scottish/International people in Edinburgh but then they go back to America and act like they're some worldly cultured people for integrating into society abroad and it's such bullshit. Put yourself out there and try to experience everything. Try haggis, go to a ceilidh, try some REAL whisky!

Don't refer to people as Americans when you're not in America. A lot of American people call black people here ""African Americans"" - seriously don't do that. It comes off as narcissistic and rude.

You're welcome to share your customs with people in Edinburgh, as a lot of the people you meet will be happy to participate (for example, I'm American and I cooked Thanksgiving dinner and invited all my friends from around the world and everyone loved it!) but at the same time, try to integrate with other people's cultures.

true,grubbymitts,eu,"European Union ","You're too young to remember the ""Boom years"" from a financial point of view.  Basically, when New Labour got in in 1997 we were at the end of an awful recession due to Maggie's Conservative agenda, Reagan's Republican agenda and the ERM crash of 1992 ( [Norman Lamont giving his speech about the crisis - oh look who's in the background](http://i.imgur.com/f4F9EVu.jpg) ).  John Major tried, but he wasn't really ever going to be a strong enough leader to encourage growth, although there were seeds of recovery as we went into 95/96.

Then along came Tony Blair.  Taking over from an already strong position left by the last true Labour leader - John Smith (who died), he took Labour from a strong party that would have won the next election anyway to a behemoth that destroyed the Conservatives in one of the biggest landslide victories in UK history in May 1997.

With this new found ""Cool Britannia"", and New Labour's touchy feely approach to regulation and business the UK became a wonderful place to invest in.  We had peace in Northern Ireland (with the Good Friday agreement ratified in 1998), massive development of old industrial centres into new, funky places (Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Leeds, Belfast) the money flowed in.  Times were good.

Wages weren't though.

But, it didn't matter.  House prices were low.  Most people your age could afford a terraced house (mine cost me £30k in 1998) or, if you were to save up, a bigger house.  And if you needed anything, well there was LOADS OF CREDIT.

Credit was everywhere.  Celebrities endorsed loans.  The APR was really low.  And if you found yourself a bit too much in debt well, you could just get another loan to consolidate all those loans into one lower payment...and then start lending all over again!  It was easy, if you couldn't pay, you just extended the loan.  You paid a lot more, but it didn't matter.  You had that really cool DVD/VHS combo and 40inch CRT TV.  You could even secure your loan against your house.  It was okay, no one was going to take away your house.

Of course, people with an ounce of sense saw that this had happened before.  In the 80s we had easy credit.  Then a massive crash in the early 90s.  So, these people said no to loans and were laughed at because they didn't have the newest stuff.

Then came September 11th 2001.  Suddenly we were thrust in to a war in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq.  The UK wasn't as favoured any more.  Very little investment happened.  New Labour lost seats with every election.  Then came the credit crunch in 2008 and massive bail outs.

Suddenly the economy crashed.  Lenders wanted their money back and fast.  People lost jobs, houses.  Well, you know what happened next.  

So, you refuse to believe that people think that they can borrow and not have to pay it back?  You don't have to believe it - it was basically policy.

You're implying STEM people are more intelligent than liberal art people?  

&gt; then we as a country have failed where perfectly intelligent people  

Are Liberal Art people not intelligent? There are different kinds of intelligence, but that's another argument.   

Liberal Arts might struggle a bit more to land a career than STEM graduates, but that doesn't make Liberal Arts pointless and redundant.  

A lot of fields in STEM might be starting to have a  saturated job market, and that will only get worse if everyone followed the reddit mentality of ""STEM is the only thing that is worth studying."" If everyone at Uni did a STEM subject, it'd be harder to get a job in STEM than a Liberal Art field because there'd be thousands of graduates applying for the same jobs.  
   

I know people who after graduation can't get into their computer-related career because there are *hundreds* of Computer Science etc. graduates applying for the same job.  

Liberal Arts doesn't equal ""Lol no job"" and I'm sick of this elitism. It can be a struggle but a lot of people can make it. If a Liberal Arts graduate is still unemployed 5 years after graduating, that's their problem, it's not because their degree is useless.  

People like you also tend to forget that not everyone *can* do STEM. Not everyone has the mind to be able to be brilliant at the Sciences. Super-pro-STEM people also tend to see that as ""Well they're less intelligent then."" No. They're just different.

Lloris 7/10 , better communication with defensive line, helps that there has been continuity in the last few games for this to develop  
Naughton : Good RB cover, didnt try to do too much, knew his role/limitations 6.5/10  
Dawson : another solid performance, calm under pressure, not bothered aerially vs crouch, good game 6.5/10  
Chiriches : recovered from the boxing day fiasco, started plays from deep in half, made it up deep into Stoke's half infrequently, also wasnt reckless as previously 6.5/10  
Fryers : ditto re Naughton , less said about AVB choices @ LB the better 6.5/10  
Dembele: good work from him today re ball winning/distribution/positional play/went for goal, more forward than sideway passing under the prev regime, upgrade from holtby ,+1 for playing 90 mins  9.5/10  
Paulinho: looked good coming back from a 3 match suspension, ball winning, distribution, vision all above avg, +1 for flair, -1 for shooting 7.5/10    
Eriksen : given freedom to go forward at will, picked up the ball from deep , good playmaking, would be even better if he developed a quick burst of speed to outpace defenders &amp; the ability to clear the defensive wall on set pieces, could be a crucial issue later on in the season 7.5/10 (expected better from set plays as I am sure he did as well, area to improve identified)  
Lennon : also good work today, highlighted by the goal he scored, as his understanding grows with soldado/ade , bodes well for the future, presents a selection/formation issue with lamela/healthy townsend , 9/10  
Ade : wasnt marked as well in the last game, had more room, good interaction with soldado, eriksen , good work rate and intensity, made some good runs on and off the ball, always top-class when he wants to be,missed an ""easy"" chance to score 7.5/10  
Soldado : lets go good-bad-good : good, movement of the ball/link up play with ade: bad, still lacking that finish in open play; good, cool as ice from the penalty spot, gives me the hardest time to rate, if he scored from open play easily 9/10, he didnt so  7.5/10,   
capoue : solid play , better at def midfield than CB in PL, 6/10  
lamela : sublime touch, good vision, potential immense, gives more variety of options on wing than lennon, missed a chance at scoring (caught btw passing to Ade/shooting, a bit rusty from lack of quality first team play)  6.5/10  

ref 5/10 (inconsistent in handing out yellows or lack of it)  

TS/ spurs think tank : what was gratifying today was instead of predetermining a formation and fitting players into a system, it seems they said, okay, who are our best players and lets find a formation in which they can excel at their natural playing skillset, hence the lopsided formation, so today the availibility of the best players determined that formation, it gives confidence to the players, 9/10  

Next game vs Man Utd. will be a true test esp if rooney is fit (he will need to be man marked over the entire pitch instead of zonal marking), shut rooney down, we have a decent chance , as both walker and rose should be back.  
Spurs has a deep squad, esp since our younger players appear PL ready, its  going to be a problem for liverpool/everton/arsenal if not already  

TLDR: 3pts from 4th CL spot

We loaned out many of the players who contributed to the lack of determination in the squad and we freed up hundreds of thousands in wages.  The work rate of the team is greatly improved and we currently reside in a playoff spot.  Quite obviously, we still have problems but I enjoy watching this squad more than I did the squad of last year.

A much fairer figure to compare would be either percentage of GDP or amount per capita.

In terms of late-serving bars, you won't have much luck right in the centre of town. But if you are drinking in the centre of town you are doing it wrong! The best bars and pubs are all a bit further out. Places to drink after 11:

* The Maypole (off Jesus Lane)
* ADC bar
* The White Swan (Mill Road, great atmosphere)
* The Geldart. This is one of those places a friend takes you to after midnight, walking through lines of terraced houses that all look the same, and you have a great night with good beers and better whiskies. Then you can NEVER FIND IT AGAIN when sober. Protip: it's on Ainsworth Street. One of the best pubs in Cambridge, hands down.

Other great places to drink outside the centre of town:

*  Darwin bar (get your whiskey education here)
* Kingston Arms, Cambridge Blue, Alexandra Arms, Live and Let Live before the Mill Road bridge. The latter has hundreds of rums, if you are into that.
* The Empress after the bridge
* The Flying Pig on Hills Road
* St Radegund, Cambridge Brew House on King's Street
* 196 Mill Road (looks like a porn shop from the outside, actually an awesome cocktail bar. In the summer they have a bring your own table policy, they are so busy)
* The Elm Tree on Eden Street. Belgian beer heaven!

true,Cyphin,silence,Silence,"*EDITED TO INCLUDE 8 and War Doctor*
Starting with 8 until I finish the rest of the classic series.  Can't just skip over 6 and 7.

**8th Doctor**

Pros:  Full of charm and amnesia, this short-lived doctor is full of mystery.  Even though the writing for the movie in which he stared was less than spectacular, the story is sound and you really do get to know this very kindhearted doctor very well on a ""personal"" level.  It is later revealed that this doctor is willing to sacrifice anything to prove his kind-nature and good intentions.

Cons:  Very short story.  Outside of prose, he is only seen a couple of times and you get very little information about who he is.

**War Doctor**

Pros:  You get to see the wear and tear war has on a man after so many years.  The story does an excellent job of portraying a man defeated by the circumstances of his life.  Very passionate but very heartbroken he is striving very hard to determine what is right and wrong.

Cons:  While also a pro, the worn out and defeated disposition of this doctor can sometimes make you feel like you should have seen the circumstances leading to this broken down and beaten man.  With so little footage of his actual conflict in the time war, it leaves you wondering what lead to this broken man, which we only get to see for a very short time before he was going to use the Moment?

**9th Doctor**

Pros:  A bit of gritty realism carefully packaged in a layer of complexity and comedy.  Hints of a story of redemption.  Wonderful mind-opener to get you prepared for the concepts you need to accept to watch the rest of the show.

Cons: Often more willing to cross lines than other doctors.  Use of bombs and weapons of mass destruction, despite being a call-back to the War Doctor and his ending of the Time war, it still produces a less Doctory Doctor.  This Doctor only got one season, which seems very short.


**10th Doctor**

Pros:  Charisma, humor, Clever.  We first see the doctor get closer than the implied ""friendzone"".  We first see that sometimes, not even the Doctor saves the day for everyone.  First time we begin to see the doctor's dark side.  Individual episodes are almost always well written.

Cons: Overwhelming sense of pride sometimes makes him look uncaring and aloof.  End of his run becomes overly but understandably emotional.  Story Arcs are much simpler during his run, often not leaving many questions left to solve.

**11th Doctor**

Pros:  The man who breaks the rules.  Friendly, dedicated, and can craft words like a blacksmith shapes metal.  Often faced with the most dire and dangerous situations with a smile on his face.  Long story arcs made this doctor have a more complex story than previous Doctors.

Cons:  Even though I praised the story arcs and how they played out, I have to condemn the writing for a lot of the actual episodes.  The writing often made individual episodes either predictable or they had the ""eureka"" solution, where something that hasn't been part of the episode at all is suddenly in the episode to save the day. The childish disposition of the doctor, while sometime enjoyable, often makes him seem even more aloof and disingenuous as a Doctor.

**12th Doctor** so far...

I am, but not out of some fandom or because I'm living in Day Of The Body-Snatchers and the Daily Mail has taken me over.  What I provided was not to persuade you, or to flavour your political discontent 'purple'.  It is what they argue, and for you to make your own bloody mind up.  And more power to you.  

To jump the impartial shark a little bit, the idea of making your own mind up and decentralising power is somewhat a UKIP trumpet call; and if one looks into it, if power were to be taken from Brussels, to Westminster, and again full heartedly to county council levels, then whilst it would be the Conservatives in power then then (as it stands) the Liberal Democrats would be the dominant party of opposition at a local level!!!

Localism actually means more 4th, 5th, 6th, even 7th, and independents having more power locally.  

If you want a party/movement to be electable that can't break into the mainstream, then in many ways a party that breaks with the status quo (whether you agree or not with it) empowers that, especially if that political pathfinder is pushing for more localism which the Labour-Conservative-LiberalDemocrat backbenchers all push for.",0,1388349086,null,0,1388352235,0,cecr1ti,t3_1txc3u,t1_cecr1ti,t1_cecpa2p,null,1427941938,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I wrote a long reply to this but firefox crashed.  To summarise it though, I'm no expert either, but my understanding is that derivatives originated as a means to insure against risk - buyers and consumers of commodities who were concerned about fluctuating prices traded futures to hedge against these (thus hedge funds) - but the problem is that the vast majority of the trade in derivative markets today involves those with no direct interest in the underlying tangible goods, services, debt, or whatever.  And, as far as I'm aware, it's perfectly possible to stack derivatives so that an underlying tangible can be bet on by multiple people/organisations, in multiple manners, insured and then reinsured many times - all of which, historically, would have been illegitimate and illegal.  If you think of it on an individual level, it's obvious why - should I be able to insure my house multiple times?  Clearly not, otherwise it's obviously in my interests that it ""has an accident"".  Neither should a random stranger with no direct interest be able to insure my house.  

If you think back to the crisis, the failure of AIG and its bailout/socialisation of losses was a infamous example of the perils of the insurance/reinsurance aspect of derivatives, and it still has ongoing repercussions.  Some analyses of the Eurozone crisis similarly raise such issues, with the reason for Greece's harsh treatment (as well as the games played in Cyprus, and the ongoing quiet hysteria about the positions of Italy, Spain etc.) being tightly tied in to esoteric knowledge about the webs of insurance and reinsurance which would collapse a further raft of British, German and American banks with massive exposure were Greece to be allowed to choose the best solution for its own population.",0,1388350357,null,0,false,0,cecrlrg,t3_1tx6od,t1_cecrlrg,t1_cecpcth,null,1427941679,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Actually, my first was Matt Smith.  I know, I know, I'm a newbie. ;)  But I had never even heard of Doctor Who for some reason, and shortly after Matt Smith started I went to see my dad and he was glued to the screen.  Wouldn't even let me talk until the episode was over.  I was super confused.  I don't even know what episode it was, because at the time I had no idea what was going on, but I liked it.  It seemed really fun and exciting.  I forgot about it for a couple weeks after that until Netflix said ""hey, we think you would like this show here"" and I was like ""oh yeah, I did want to watch that.""  So I started from the beginning of the new series, and I just couldn't stop.  I watched the entire thing from 2005 through the end of Matt's first season in less than a week.  I'm pretty much obsessed with it now.  I've watched every episode and minsode of the current series multiple times, and a great deal of the Classic episodes, though no where near all of them.  There are a lot, and they are harder to track down.  But, yeah, Matt Smith.  Losing him on Christmas was SO hard.  When I watched Eccelston and Tenant regenerate, I already knew what I had to look forward to.  Sure, I cried, but I was comforted by the knowledge that I already knew Smith was awesome.  This was the first Doctor I lost in real-time.  Not knowing anything for sure about the future.  Amy was the first companion I lost in real-time, with the future undetermined.  I loved Amy so much, when she showed up on Christmas I just lost it.  Seriously, I cried like a baby.  Eleven will always be in my heart as my first Doctor.

true,blacksmithwolf,null,null,"I agree that no one holds a candle to martin when it comes to killing off characters but he has A LOT more characters than a series like harry potter which kind of makes a straight body count comparison misleading. 

A quick google search says that there are between 1200-1300 named characters in the first five books of ASOIAF so killing off hundreds barely makes a dent.  Harry Potter however has a much smaller cast of characters and a lot more of the attention is focused on the core cast with the side story characters getting no where near as much exposition which results in key character deaths having huge impact on the plot.

For example if you were to kill 30 people in the first 5 chapters of the next asoiaf book you could continue the story without a hitch. hell, he probably kills more than 30. however if you were to kill 30 named characters at the start of a random harry potter book you probably wouldnt have enough left to finish the story

While Martin will always be the king of axeing his character count other writers also make some pretty serious cuts to the roster but thanks to their more condensed list it doesnt add the same shock value when you look at it in pure numbers.

That's one of the main reasons I seem to have stopped cycling. 
But after setting up a cycling club, I realise that cycling seems to have it's unfair share of pretentious, arrogant and rude idiots and the majority of them seem to be commuters who lycra up on the way to and from work. 

Don't get me wrong, I wore lycra, very expensive gear and have a silly expensive bike.
And I had no issue with people who wore lycra and wanted to ride fast, whether thats on long, 100mile rides or simply getting home from work, if they like it then good for them! In fact it bemuses me when people do have a problem with them.

At the same time, I had no issue with the bloke getting to work, or the family out on a fun ride on a Sunday afternoon. 

Different people do different things with bikes, that's one of the great things about bike riding. 
But there are so many different little social circles, giving each other grief when it comes to cycling! Constantly judging each other, telling each other that they are the best group. It's pathetic.

We have a very young back line minus Dawson at the moment, and it takes the new players a lot longer to gel to a new league and team than any of us know. Selling your leading goal scorer and bringing in countless players unproven in the premier league has not always equated into imediate onslaughts of goals. Fact of the matter is we sold 21 goals in Bale. Benched Defoes 11 goals. Sold Clint dempseys 7 (I think most were against Utd and the rest weren't that great.) And snubbed Adebayors 5. After that we come to sigs, Vertonghen, and Lennon with 11 goals between them I think. All of which have played on and off due to injury or selection this season.

But I'm getting away from the point. Tottenham pretty much started from scratch this year with a new team. AVB benched players who had proven some worth, played some out of position, and failed to change up things that were not working. We did get mildly lucky with a few calls going our way, but lets not be too judgemental of our squad adapting to this league. Give them the rest of this year and an entire off season to work together before you lay that judgment. As they say Rome wasn't build in a day and neither was a good footballing club.

I am however criticizing the decision to put him on for 30 minutes while 1 down to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge... with Aspas and Alberto (2 players with first team experience, however limited, who are obviously at a much closer level to what the game was than Smith).  It was absolutely the wrong time to give a kid his first go in a game that we really could have used a point from.  I firmly believe that BR got this wrong, regardless of if the result would have changed or not should he have brought on a different player.

EDIT: I got ahead of myself.  Suarez didn't need room to move.  The problem today as far as Suarez was concerned was that we couldn't get players close enough to him to give him some support and service.  He was completely isolated for the vast majority of the game.  Couple that with him not really having his best match (his tough looked quite off to me today, had a hard time keeping the ball under control) and it was painful.  Alberto is a smart enough player to keep himself to the flank, or you let Coutinho stay out there and Alberto comes into the middle with fresh legs and instructions to press like his life depended on it.  It wasn't a matter of leaving that flank open either as he came on for Allen, a central midfielder.  We didn't have particularly huge problems on that side of the pitch anyway, Willian was much more dangerous coming from the right and Hazard eventually drifted towards the middle to get away from Agger, who played him quite well.  Smith was absolutely not the only option and his introduction did nothing to solve any of our problems in this match.  Again, this isn't a knock on Smith himself, but on BR making what I think was a poor choice in bringing him on.

For the love of god [book them in advance](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/). You can still get tickets for £29 return (I just checked), but if you leave it until the last minute that will go *way* up. You have to use them on the train you are booked on, but that shouldn't be a problem for you guys, as you have booked your hotel so you know when you will be travelling.

When you are in London, get an [Oyster card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do), if you are in town for 3 days, I would allow £25-30 for that. Might be worth asking your friend if (s)he knows someone who can lend you one.

Knock the £100 for your hotel off and that still leaves you with £340 to keep you busy, which should be plenty, especially if you aren't eating out much.

I can't be much use to you for London, but if you are into Museums/Galleries, there are plenty of excellent [free ones](http://www.timeout.com/london/museums/free-museums-in-london). They are all pretty standard for tourists, but they are popular for a reason. I would try and hit them up on Thursday or Friday when they will (hopefully) be quieter. If you are minded to you could easily kill all three of your days in London in these places without spending a penny on anything but your hotel, supermarket food, and booze.

I cant personally help you with pub/bar recommendations, but I might ask my dad if I speak to him later on and edit some in for you if I remember. If I forget, [the internet is your friend](http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-and-pubs/the-100-best-bars-and-pubs-in-london).

As for Preston and Manchester, it sound like your friend has these more under control, but If you like the outdoors, you could do a lot worse than a trip up to the Lake District. If you are feeling a bit more ambitious, you could maybe see if you can sneak a couple of days in Glasgow or Edinburgh.

You can't beat them up and they probably know this (so probably won't be scared even if you do have a baseball bat). They might very well give you lip and continue.

It may be a hassle, but maybe think of taking off some of the crucial levers, such as the gear lever or brake or clutch levers. If they can't operate it then it holds no value to them other than a bonfire, which is also possible. I know some bikes are easier to do this on than others, but it may help!

Other than this, as another poster said a massive ground anchor. You don't have to damage your property by drilling holes. You can go out to B&amp;Q and get quick setting concrete or post filler (the stuff you just have to add water to and is about 3 quid for a large bag) and a perishable container big enough to hold a decent amount.

2. Contact has to be significant enough where the player is thrown off balance. Suarez lifts his feet off the ground.

The Netherlands solved this problem decades ago and as a result, something like 70% of adults regularly ride a bike for local transport, with a corresponding decrease in traffic problems, obesity, air pollution, etc etc. Even if you don't want to ride a bike everybody wins - the roads are much quieter and safer, it's MUCH easier for those in wheelchairs to get about, children can play safely on the street. And when you do drive, less likely to be caught in traffic.
Millions of people in the UK would like to cycle to work or let kids ride to school, but sharing roads with cars terrifies them. £42bn is easily enough to build NL-style infrastructure all over the place, removing that problem. The crux of the issue is that they spend about £30 per person per annum on this part of the road network - we spend next to nothing on our shitty shared pavements.

* Get a CCTV camera so you can at least ID the youths. They're fairly cheap these days, and you can hide them in a lot of places.

* Consider bringing it inside if you live on the ground floor. I grew up in a tiny village that had a library that was really the spare room in a librarian's tiny house. Her son kept his motorbike there. It's odd, but it's not unheard of. Just deal with the space issues later.

* Move. Your theft insurance is probably higher just by living in Pilton

* I've seen bike owners with big thick canvas sheets they cover their bike with. Some are pretty secure and can be anchored like a tent. The extra hassle might make it not worth it, or it might make them curious. It's hard to tell. Openly piss on the sheet regularly to make them less curious. Only half joking.


Good luck, but if it's stressing you out this much, it's better to just get a rock solid insurance plan.

true,refcon,null,null,"The difference being that when Brown/Blair came into power it was during a period of strong economic growth they inherited from John Major. Osborne/Cameron on the other hand inherited a tepid economy, in a situation of global recession. 

Moreover the early Brown/Blair years also coincided with the late 1990's dot-com bubble which both fueled asset prices (boosting capital gains and stamp duty revenue) and company profits. This also had beneficial one off effects such as the immensely profitable auction of the 3g mobile spectrum, the mobile companies massively overbidding due to the large amounts of capital they were able to secure. 

They also enjoyed favourable headwinds from the liberalisation of the banking sector, primarily though the huge tax revenues generated by large banks/financial services based in London, moreover due to the debt fueled boom in house prices there was also a  continual increase in revenues generated from housing stamp duty. As we know now the economic growth in the Western world in the 2000's was very much a house of cards, still they were in power throughout what was known as 'The Great Moderation' where the business cycle looked as if it were defeated. 

Cameron on the other hand came into power when financial services had greatly reduced in size (thus diminishing tax revenue) and the housing boom stagnated. This adversely affects the deficit in 2 ways - the number of people working/companies earning profits falls which decreases tax revenues, at the same time the now unemployed people claim benefits increasing government spending. It is hardly surprising that this is reflected in a greater deficit.

The Labour government significantly increased government spending on the basis that there was a permanently larger tax base supplied by the city of London. When the city contracted it reduced the tax base, leaving the larger government spending without a means to fund itself - this inevitably led to larger deficits. 

I am not passing judgement on the wisdom of the austerity budgets, merely pointing out it is deeply unfair to compare 2010 with 1997.

Most of these kids do indeed think they're beyond reach. That is how they have gotten their number of stolen bikes into the 100's.

I've always been a big scifi nerd, and one day while watching the Next Generation on BBC America, Doctor Who came on immediately after.  I had always been intrigued by the commercials BBC played for the show, so I decided to give it a shot.  
The episode was The Doctors Wife.  While yes I had virtually no idea what was going on with the show.  (The whole talk of the Doctor doing something to his people and the Tardis being bigger on the inside really just confused me.)  But this was the perfect episode for me to start with in my opinion because of a few reasons:
1. Smith's performance instantly conveyed the clear regret he felt for his deed and the ways that he tried to make up for it.  Yeah, I didn't know what that regret was, but his acting made the emotion clear.  
2. The scenes with the Tardis (Idris) and the Doctor talking were brilliant.  Their argument was able to show a depth to each of the shows main ideas that I don't feel a lot of episodes show.  

So, after that episode, the Curse of the Black Spot was on next and I decided to watch that.  While I know a lot of people hate this episode, it was still a good way for me to ease into the show.  I really loved the way the show explained a lot of mystery that's always existed in human history.  
From there, I went on netflix and started just jumping around episode to episode, never watching any of them in order other than the ones that were either two parts or watching them as they aired in Series 6.  To me, that actually was better for me than watching them sequentially because most of the doctors adventures don't need to be exactly in order.

true,bb1289,null,null,"Manchester is a great city, its where I was dragged up, its home to one fantastic football team, and has a lot of industrial, urban charm to it. 

A place for sight seeing it is not (in my opinion) 

Will you have access to a car? If so, you have the luxury of some of the most interesting places in the UK on your doorstep.

Derbyshire is about 35 miles south of manchester (and currently where my mother lives) and it is incredibly beautiful. Its real countryside, has many tourists attractions and has a lot to do for someone who wants to venture of the well beaten track. 

There are obvious tourist attractions:

http://www.chatsworth.org/
http://www.haddonhall.co.uk/

And some less so. For example, there are a number of quaint little villages such as buxton, bakewell and eyam (a quite famous plague village) Just don't spend too much time there at night...the farmers like a fight (only half kidding).

There are a number of caves (such as blue john cavern), great hikes (mam tor, Monsall trail, Goyt valley), Some traditional pubs such as the ""bull i'th' thorn"" (It used to be a nice pub serving good grub - its been a long time since I have been, so no promises - it is also a bit ""out of the way)

But it really is a beautiful county.

East of Manchester you have Yorkshire which also has some incredible sites and things to do. 

Again, absoloutely fascinating county. Notable places are: 

Holmefirth, Leeds (though mostly for a night out in my experience) York, Harrogate (these two are a bit further away from manc), 

The above (other than leeds) are again, very quaint english towns. Holmfirth had a tv show filmed in it (last of the summer wine) and they really do have that old english appeal. There you can get a portion of fish and chips, eat it down by the river for example. York is a fantastic city, really intriguing. 

Leeds is a student town, never really saw the appeal other than the otley run, to be honest. BUt if you're up there may be worth a glance.

On the west side of manchester is the lake district. I'd love to tell you mroe, but sadly I've never been. I know its beautiful landscape, beautiful scenery, but never had the chance myself.

Chester is also quite a nice town (in the day) within old castle walls, nice layout, old time feel to it.

If you can go a bit further, you may want to carry on past chester to Conwy Castle. Thats a very interesting town.

As for the wider UK if you do end up getting the opportunity I would definitely reccomend:

Cornwall, Bristol, Salisbury (particularly the cathedral, less so stone henge); and parts of surrey and kent are beautiful as well.

In London (I live there currently) unfortuantely some of the best things to do involve eating and drinking. 

Borough market is a must if you are a foody. The south bank is a very pleasant walk. As for obscure sites, I can't help you a great deal. Working somewhere tends to mean you don't explore.

Maybe this will help: http://hidden-london.com/ or thisL http://www.shadyoldlady.com/theme.php?theme=Quirky

However, there is the ""serpentine"" which is a swimming lake, thats kind of obscure. The Huntarian museum is not in most guides; its basically the college of surgeons museum full of medical oddities.

Shame you're not spending a bit more time traveling, to be honest. If you have a car or access to a car you'll have a lot more fun.

If you do decide you want to see a football game (and there is a home one during your stay) I MAY be able to sort out tickets to see city. I say may because they issue individual cards which allow access to the stadium, and as I live in London physically getting the cards over there may be hard. However, I'm sure there is a way to get paper tickets sent your way. HAving said that, you may be able to go to the ground and get paper tickets yourself. Just have a look at the fixture list (if you're at all interested in football).

Hope this was helpful.

Having City and Chelsea in such a short span is no easy task, we were just a bit outplayed and unlucky at times. Shit happens, gotta move on.

As far as being realistic goes, I generally say every time the team got a new manager after Rafa, it would set the team back from being realistic sure fired top 4 contenders by about 1 1/2-2 1/2 seasons. If it's obvious, the team has been all over the place with the various managers in the past couple of seasons. There wasn't really a moment to build on pure consistency. 

I'd say we're in a better place with Rodgers but there is still work to be done. I also generally say that as long as a team doesn't rack up more than 8 or 9 losses and a high amount of draws, top 4 is definitely a possibility.

Celeb PaedoGeddon - Mostly still awaiting trail and sub judice. So other than the Saville JIbes, there's not actually much you can say about it.

Woolwich attacks - One of the ""Media"" events of the decade, never mind 2013, but still Sub Judice and so unmentionable apart from a tiny reference.

Other than that, 2013 has been a year of grinding shitness. Slowly dragging ourselves out of the mire, hoping for good news, clinging onto a royal birth like a helium balloon will drag us out of the quicksand, and ""major"" things like Snowdon, PRISM, Assange, Internet Filters and the creeping oppression of the state have all been so ubiquitous that you can't remember if they started this year or last.

There was definately less piss and vinegar in him, but lets not forget he's been doing this for 15 years now and you can't stay angry forever. I too was disappointed that things like Prism were effectively glossed over with a shrug and ""Meh, thought so"".

Shitpeas and Cunk were pointless. Lazily penned drivel, IMO. And I've never understood the little ""promo"" slots for the TV shows in Media wipe. I suppose it feels it has to sling some praise about amongst the shit, but now Brooker is making his own TV, it feels a bit media circle jerk.

1. Lots of atheists find religion (and vice versa) also, I believe it's COMPLETELY within the realm of possibilities that something as fundamental as religion and 'core tenets' could be changed by regeneration. Look at War Doctor and Valeyard.

2. You're forgetting River's consciousness being locked away from her body. Remember the logic when everyone on here was sure Clara was River. If she did regenerate, we don't know what the timeline is. ""river"" saw the doctor as 11 TONS of times. But we don't know where in The Doctor's time stream he has met Tasha before. She could have seem his as 5, 3, 9, and then 16 for all we know.

3. You're completely making assumptions here. First, we NEVER saw that river's body had ""decayed"". Also, we have NO evidence that regeneration is a gift of the body and not the mind. We've seen timelords in old serials die without regenerating plenty. (Deadly Assassin; Day of the Doctor). Their body didn't help them then.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"There are Youth access centres the nation over who provide specific information  for those in exactly your position. They will know pathways into education, and they will be very glad to deal with someone who is trying to plan their future.

For what it's worth, I too fucked up my A-Levels badly first time around, C,D X and U after year 1 (Yes, those last two are possible), so I spent the next 2 years working my arse off and ended up with a A's, B's and C's across 6 subjects, a total in points terms of about 5 A-Levels. That got me to Uni, I did a 4 year degree in 3 years and have never looked abck. However, Having completed your A-Levels I think there are probably better routes for you to take. Don't sweat it, no-one looks at A-Levels once you have a higher qualification, vocational or whatever.

My primary suggestion would be to sit down and think about what lead to you not achieving what you wanted to in your first attempt at A-LEvels. For me it was Drinking, Playstation, my first proper girlfriend, having a proper social circle af sixth form after years of bullying at secondary school, and a lack of hard work after aceing my GCSE's and thinking I could achieve without putting the effort in. Only you know what went ""wrong"" and why YOU let it slip. You can only blame lacklustre teaching, subject choice so much. You have to know in your own mind what needs to be addressed. The critical thing is that you rectify the problems BEFORE you find yourself with 4 hours teaching contact time in a city with 24/7 social life and total control over you own finances and schedule.

If you fucked up A-Levels due to poor self discipline, you'll doubly fuck up a degree unless your heart and soul are in the DEGREE, not the ""uni"" or the social life, or the clubs. Those things are brilliant, and important, but they're secondary to the reason you're at Uni - to become a specialist in a subject and to make yourself employable.

So, find a youth service who can signpost you to college/foundation course access. Look deep into your own soul, picture where you want to be in 5/10 years, and what will make you happy, and aim for that. You won't get there, life will get in the way, but you need a goal to move forwards. You might end up somewhere better, you just can't see if from where you are. Consider foundation courses, consider also apprenticeships and more hands on schemes. It may be that purely academic student life isn't for you.

Once you have that momentum, talk seriously to your dad. He will no doubt be worried that as a self employed man, he's raised a lazy labourer who can't achieve at school. He hasn't, but if you talk to him as an adult concerned for their future, it will put his mind at rest and prove to him that you do want to make a fist of it.

You say he ""makes a lot of money"". As a painter and decorator, I strongly doubt that, in real terms. He makes a living, I'm sure he works hard, but ""makes a lot of money"" is all relative. I think you need your horizons lifting. Go and speak to organisations who can help you achieve.

A quick google shows [The Base](http://www.hewett.org.uk/thebase.html) youth services in Norwich, and [City College](http://www.ccn.ac.uk/) offer further education and learning. I'm sure either of those would be able to point you to helpful resources if they can't offer them themselves. Find your local youth services and USE THEM TO HELP YOU MAKE DECISIONS. I wasn't paying 40% tax for the likes of you to ignore the services it paid for ;)

You don't hire Luis Van Gaal and stick him in the front office especially when you already have Baldini in the the DoF role. Which means you are bringing him in to be the manager and shape the way the club is set up moving forward.

Even if Sherwood does exceed the expectations of everyone and maintains the manager role there seems like there would be an odd dynamic that you would be forcing on everyone.  Think about Sherwood going into a meeting about transfers and sitting across the table is Levy, Baldini and Van Gaal.....what if they don't agree with the transfer?...Levy you can chalk up to him being the chairman, but if Van Gaal and Baldini don't believe in the transfer how the hell do you argue against to of the most respected names in European football?  Or what happens to Sherwood if he has a 4 game slide?

* You're giving them £9k a year, so they can pay more to teachers. Better teachers often equals better results. 

* They need to keep their ""excellence"". This is measured using qualifications - so they will push their pupils (for better or for worse) to higher levels of attainment. Similarly, they want to get more pupils into ""top"" universities.

**The Disadvantages**

* They can be very pushy - both the school and the parents. If little Johhny or Jane comes home and says they fucked up in a test - you're going to look at it differently if you've forked out thousands of £s. 

**My thoughts:**

Private schools get a bad rep. If you mention it to Joe Public, they immediately think of Eton. The average public school, including the one you mentioned, sets the bar a bit lower. But the extreme is what gets remembered. 

I have been in a long-term relationship with my partner since we were 16. She was in Private School, myself in state education. We both ended up at the same university, with very similar A-Levels &amp; GCSEs. However, she did study ""older"" subjects (including Latin and Ancient Greek). I know mates from state education who ended up in Oxbridge as top students, and people from the private school who didn't get in to uni at all... 

It is important that the money paid to enter one of those schools comes from the parent not the child - so isn't really a reflection on the kid so much as their parents (though, I'd be daft to pretend that it doesn't rub off!). A lot of private schools also offer bursaries to the cleverer kids, to try and boost their achievements.

* Where you live isn't nearly as important as WHO you live with. Get some good mates (either on your course or in your halls) and then sort out where.

* There are more houses than there are students. *But the good ones will sell first!*

* All letting agencies will rip you off. Be thorough as anything, and document **everything**. If you can get in touch with the landlord, that's normally quicker.

When you're looking around houses:

* Ask the current tenants if they've had any problems with the house OR letting agency. 

* Keep a note of what the letting agents/landlord promise, and then **check that it is in the contract**. 

* Get a copy of the contract a few days before you sign it. Your union may have someone who can look over it for you and point out potential headaches.

His link up play down the right was good for a player who hardly gets any game time there.

I actually liked Eriksen on the left though.  He came in a lot, but we've needed that fluid movement and interchanging of positions from our midfield all season.  It's something Liverpool, Chelsea, City and Arsenal all do very well with multiple attacking midfielders on the pitch at once.  With Adebayor and Soldado constantly dropping deep to get involved and Paulinho marauding forward, the Stoke players had a very hard time picking up our play.  This season we've been far too one-dimensional with either inverted wingers, or out and out wingers being relatively easy to mark and track.

His pass to Azpi for Eto'o's goal is an example of this. 

I feel that when we are playing at home and are playing a more attacking role it would be a good choice for him to sit in the deep lying playmaker role. He really can open up a game and I was a big advocate for when Rafa had his playing there last year.

Economically it does make sense. Its like making an investment. When you take out a mortgage or a loan you immediately go into the red. But you are given the potential to improve your lot long into the future.

The Rep of Ireland as it is is already paying for the north. That being the northern half of the island. It is way behind in infrastructure and investment. Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan all struggle economically due to being cut off from their natural population hinterlands (similar to border areas of the north). 

The Northern Ireland economy has run a deficit every year since 1931 and it most likely always will. Choosing to leech off another country is not a sound long term economic policy.

I'd definitley vote Yes to a United Ireland. Its long overdue and we will never see prosperity on this half of the island until we are rid of the border.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think they need to bring back the mystery. It seems 99% of where the Doctor goes he knows all about the locations, the people, their food, their gadgets, the bad guys, etc. That's why I love Midnight. The Doctor has no clue what the hell is going on. I'd like to see the Doctor get into a situation where he has no clue who the bad guys are, where they come from, or what they might be up to. 

I think with Capaldi they have a chance to bring back that mysterious aspect. To move away from the God-like Doctor who knows everything. Let's make him a bit flawed. He makes some mistakes, he's out of his element sometimes. Let's get back some drama and tension in the series.

As dpamac said: ""It's been too hero worshipy for too long.""


How many times has the Earth been attacked in the new series? Each time has been a bloody snooze fest.  There is no suspense. While the classic series wasn't perfect I miss some of those stories because I sat there with a stupid grin on my face thinking ""How in the HELL is the Doctor going to get out of this mess and save the day? It's impossible, he can't!"" And yet he always did. 

I don't get that feeling much anymore...what little threat has been posed to the Doctor is met by a ""Ah, let's use the sonic and have some grand speech about being a lonely time lord and that will pad out the ending.""

I think with Capaldi we might see a shift away from the companion flirting, the catchphrases, and the godlike Doctor stuff.  The Doctor is going to roughed up, he's going to be near failure often and just maybe...just maybe through last minute desperation he just happens to save the day. He's just someone who enjoys traveling and just so happens to get into trouble. He doesn't see himself as a hero or the savior of the universe, he's just the Doctor.

Firstly, the IWF doesn't try to filter anything as far as my reading can discern, though I'll admit to a degree of ignorance about the organisation (I read several things on its website which its wikipedia page contradicts, so if I'm incorrect about this then consider me open-minded) and according to it's wikipedia page it consists of...14 people. That would be 14 people being somehow equivalent to the muscle of several of the country's largest ISPs? Yeah, I think not. 

Besides, if the ""wall of text"" puts people off then that's their fault. You can lead a horse to water, et cetera.

As for the ""speculation"" I would argue that speculation is the conclusion of a point with no visible or valid reason. The reasons why I say what I have said are made clear. In addition, I have tried to highlight the most troubling aspects of this concept, such as the lack of oversight or parliamentary backing. Such as the obscurity, vagueness or inappropriate nature of some of the blocked subjects. Such as the simple and as-yet inadequately answered question as to ""Why?""

If that, to you, counts as speculation then I shall happily call myself Sir Speculator of St Mary Cray.

I didn't know anything about Mobile Internet Filters, so I googled the term and came up with a series of websites from a variety of companies, from Google to Apple, advertising the sale of such filters. So I added ""Labour"" into the search and was presented with a series of articles and editorials about Labour's fabulous failure to capitalise on Mr Cameron's web-obsession in relation to the filters we're discussing rather than the ones Labour, to quote, ""Pushed to have (with no parliamentary oversight.)

I'm not going to assume you're lying, but if you're aware of a good source of information or are aware of the formal name of these filters then I'd be happy to look them up and have a read.

Also, unrelated, but I find myself wishing that they had been called ""Mobile Internet Local Filers"" or something of the sort, purely so we could refer to them as ""milfs.""

If you don't have the patience for that, then Jon Pertwee is where to start; it's the first ones in color (although there is one episode that only exists in black and while) and much of the ongoing canon from later episodes first show up during the Pertwee era.  You'll miss Troughton's Doctor, but you'll get to see him again in The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, and The Two Doctors, so it's not a total loss.

However, Pertwee's Doctor is pretty hostile the first couple of seasons and constant stories with UNIT can get boring.  If you find you don't like him, you can skip to Tom Baker.  However, please keep in mind that that first season of Tom Baker's episodes are also not the best (but they get much, MUCH better!).

About.com *Definition: The act of kicking a ball when it is off the ground.*

From the Guardian *These are goals where the player manufactures the volley himself, having received either a flat pass or a bouncing one. The primest cuts are probably Paul Gascoigne against Scotland and Thierry Henry against Manchester United.*

None of these are very good sources obviously, but any quick internet search shows what a volley is.

If you flick the ball into the air, and hit it before it hits the ground that is a volley. There is nothing to say that it has to come from another player.

Personally I like to hop around. I'd recommend watching 1 story from each doctor and then deciding which doctors you enjoy the most and watch those stories and then by the point you finish those there is a good chance you'll want to know more so you find yourself more easily engrossed in the adventures of the doctors you initially found less magnetic.

Here are couple suggestions of eps to watch that are rather good in my opinion

First Doctor - An Unearthly Child (pilot ep, see how it all began, this doctor is not a nice guy at first), Keys to Marinus (one of my favorites)

Second Doctor - The Ice Warriors, Tomb of the Cybermen


Third Doctor - The Sea Devils, Planet of the Spiders

Fourth Doctor - The E-space trilogy (Full Circle, State of Decay, Warrior's Gate), well pretty much every Tom Baker serial was good in my opinion.

Fifth Doctor - The Five Doctors, Resurrection of the Daleks

Sixth Doctor- Mark of the Rani (Colin Baker had a short run and most of his eps are one long serial called Trial of a Timelord which is heavy timelord canon.)

Seventh Doctor - Paradise Towers, The Happiness Patrol (2 of my favorite stories)

Soldado's had a lot of chances which he hasn't capitalised on, Defoe hasn't had a run in the team and hasn't played with Adebayor. I think we need to give him a chance because at the moment, Soldado just can't hit the back of the net and we can't afford to waste opportunities against the likes of Arsenal and Man U in the coming days.

2. Paulinho was absolutely outstanding. I will admit, I've doubted him and I was pleased he was sent off against Liverpool to give us a chance to play others in the midfield, but his performance today was fantastic. His flair and his ability to beat players and create chances was something we hadn't really seen under AVB's less risky style of play, but I think Paulinho will thrive under Sherwood and I'm really excited by that.

3. Sort of touched on this above, but finishing is still an issue. I think this looks like it'll be less of a problem under Sherwood as we are creating some fantastic chances and a larger number of chances, but we still need to be putting more in the back of the net. Realistically, we should've won 5-0.

I didn't mean to suggest regeneration wasan automatic function of the body, just that it is (or seems to be) a function of the body. Like running.

I'm here because I follow some subs from countries I've visited or would like to visit, home-countries of cool people I've met here in America, places my students are from, languages I've tried to learn, places that just interest me for other reasons, etc. 

(I don't usually comment on those subs too much unless someone has a U.S.-related question I can help with, or something is related to current events/topics I'm actually reading about, and so hopefully I don't annoy people too much!) 

I find it very interesting &amp; informative to see what people in other parts of the world have to say about...well, life, events, whatever they're talking about? I may be a bit odd that way, for an American, maybe, maybe not--hopefully not!

Looks like I am a bit of an old lady here, too, so probably I'm closer in age to some of your Mums than I am to any of y'all :)

Being a librarian, I'm always happy to try and help anyone with any questions when I can, so anyone planning to travel, look for work, come to school, whatever, related to the U.S., feel free.

I'm pretty happy with my work. In five years I expect to be here doing pretty much the same (my parents are getting on in years and needing more help, so I can't really make any big moves that would take me too far away.)

River's mind gets uploaded to the Database. River's consciousness is gone. BUT, her body still regenerates after it dies from the overload. Then the body has regenerated into a new person but it's missing most of what makes River ""River"". 

But yeah, I think they gave River one final goodbye in The Name of The Doctor. And I think the intent is to move on. She was a great character, but the concept was a little too grand for what the show can do. The idea of someone that was with The Doctor in every regeneration and fell in love with him and adventured with all of his bodies is a great idea... but the show just can't honestly pull it off (for obvious reasons of actors getting old and dying and whatnot). I was a little against it originally but Kingston's performance made me love her episodes. I would love to see someone do something like an ongoing series of comic books starring River so that we could expand upon her and see her meeting ALL the doctor's and spending time with them all.

Personally I think it's *got* to be Jimmy Carr. It just fits with the information we have. It's a regular guest who is still on the show regularly, it's a guest who Stephen Fry says (something like) ""That person is good enough to not need it, but they insist.""

What really makes me think it's Jimmy? His personality. When he was on Top Gear, he got the best time record (since been broken, I believe) not really by his driving ability but by taking a chance and getting lucky (I know shit about cars, this is what I was told by various watchers of Top Gear). Jimmy Carr wants to be the best. On Top Gear, he really wanted to set the record. He's often chided for preparing material for shows that aren't supposed to be scripted, I think because he's actually not that great on his feet and is the kind of person to *always* have something to say prepared. For example, when he's insulted by a guest on QI (I forget which episode, I think the one where they talk about comic book characters that inspired real inventions) he kind of tries to play it off laughingly but he's obviously bothered, and after like 6 seconds pass he says ""I can't believe your mother told you that"" like he was obviously offended and bothered that he had nothing to say back.

He's always trying to be prepared, always trying new material or using old material and doesn't like to wing it, and is a right enough of an ass to actually insist on something like having the questions before the show. We know he doesn't mind cheating to get ahead behind closed doors.

The 9th Doctor claimed to be 900. This is the only time the Doctor ever claimed to be younger than before.

The 10th Doctor claimed to be 903, meaning 9's claim of 900 wasn't just rounding down his real age.

Ultimately, though, what formation and roles you use depends on what players you have available. I don't think we have a real left winger in the squad. Chadli and Townsend are the closest approximations, but Chadli is right footed and Townsend is more comfortable on the right.

I agree that West Brom gave us problems, but I don't think the lack of a left winger was the problem. Out of possession, a player like Eriksen or Gylfi can be asked to drop back and defend. The problem was our overly-attacking midfield 2. 

A more defensive midfielder like Capoue or Sandro (even Paulinho or Dembele could do this... Dembele has definitely taken over the LB position at times when the defender moves forward) can be asked to shuttle out to the left when the ""winger"" is in the middle of the pitch or further forward.

Humans might react to kill those Silence because they recognize them differently, as if they could tell if those particular breed were the ones to attack because they had killing intent, instead of the docile priests. If you want a really off the wall idea, it could be something as simple as a perfect match with what they saw on the moon landing footage- a Silent in a black suit. Ergo, ""kill the Silence who are wearing black suits""- these original Silents were wearing turtlenecks like high-collared priests, though if that really was the case, it'd be absolutely ridiculous.

And way back in ""Terror of the Autons"" the Third Doctor said that people try to resist hypnotic commands if they would cause a person to do something that defies their nature, when the Master brainwashed Jo and he had to snap her out of the trance. Subliminal commands, like ""YOU SHOULD KILL US ALL ON SIGHT"", are a form of hypnosis. So unless Clara is willing to kill, she wouldn't. She's very compassionate about life and cried for a good reason when she saw the three Doctors try to destroy Gallifrey.

true,ScalierLemon1,clara,Clara,"**8th Doctor**

Pros: Epic hair. Fought the Master in his first episode/movie. Became John Hurt upon regenerating. Wasn't in Love &amp; Monsters.

Cons: Very little screen time. 

**War Doctor**

Pros: Acted like an older man. Was believable as a veteran. Played by John Hurt. Wasn't in Love &amp; Monsters

Cons: Only one episode. Played by John Hurt, and didn't regenerate from something besides age killing him (John Hurt dies a lot in movies). Didn't have a cool companion.

**9th Doctor**

Pros: Played the war veteran pretty well. Picked up Jack as a companion. Likes bananas. Was all around Fantastic! Wasn't in Love &amp; Monsters.

Cons: Rose, I don't like Rose. 

**10th Doctor**

Pros: Lion King reference. Charismatic, energetic, and funny. Had one of my favorite companions, Donna

Cons: Got whiny in the Series 4 Specials. Was in Love &amp; Monsters. Blew up the TARDIS. Nearly killed Matt Smith.

**11th Doctor**

Pros: Energetic, funny. Good fashion sense. Bow tie. Had Rory and Clara as companions. Handles. His speeches, especially the one to Colonel Runaway. Generally good episodes. Wasn't in Love &amp; Monsters. 

Cons: Could be silly. Let's Kill Hitler had no killing of Hitler. Didn't genocide the Daleks once in his run, he destroyed an armada, but not the whole species. Lied to us about staying for Series 8. 

**12th Doctor**
Pros: KIDNEYS!

Cons: He doesn't like the color. Wasn't in Love &amp; Monsters.",0,1388391131,null,0,false,0,ced81am,t3_1tybgt,t1_ced81am,t3_1tybgt,null,1427933868,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,SuperMarioSkux,lfc68,,"As armadachamp said (not sure how to link a persons profile in), finding the talent for the right price is the problem. At the start of the season it was known that our squad was shallow in terms of experience. It is all and well having young players that are fresh out of the academy full of zest and fizz, that are willing to learn and run their hearts out but the experience is what we are lacking. The cool and calm head to keep everything in order come the last 20mins of a tough game like that at Chelsea and City in the last week. I know its hard finding that experience but for me you need to look at players who have played CL or Uefa League. If you are to stick to the transfer policy (which I fully agree with) you will struggle to find these old heads on young players and if you do they will be expensive young lads.

For me I think players along the lines of Fernando (Porto) is a good option. He has immense experience at this level and can hold a midfield together. The other obvious but expensive one is Matuidi, many players follow managers or other players (look at Alonso moving to Liverpool after speaking with Arteta). We should make a move on the back of the French tax move and the fact that Matuidi and Sakho are very close friends. The other DM I like the look of is Lars Bender at Leverkusen, a player of the future who is very good at the moment, I do admit that trying to pry him from a side that is 2nd in the Bundesliga will be very tough.

As for attacking players I honestly think we are only one player away, lots of people on the /r/LiverpoolFC seem to be obsessed with buying two or three new attacking players. I understand the need for a playmaker in the mould of Coutinho but is Suso not shaping into this mould. Coutinho had a similar run for Espanyol that Suso is for Almeria. I am a little confused as to the need for a new winger. I am aware that Moses is playing pretty average at the moment and that Aspas is looking to have a similar season to FabB (Bless him in recovery), I am concerned that Alberto has been used sparingly in a central role (in which he is his best), as he has looked good in the minutes he has had as a late sub (be it due to tired opposition legs). 

If I was to target anyone as an attacking player I would enquire about Griezmann (Sociedad), Shaqiri (FC Bayern, and I can imagine peoples eyes rolling already. But unless Robben leaves he isn't going to get a lot of game time. Is it not worth a short term loan as Bayern are playing similar style to us at LFC? plus the training with such an experienced side as that of Bayern), I would've said Lamela this time last season but AVB had done something to him, I have watched a little of Duricic at Benfica and I think he is raw talent, but obviously lacks experience.

As for the defenders, I don't think it is as upsetting as everyone is making out. The coming out party for Jon Flanagan will continue to go on for a while now. He is a perfect example of what the LFC academy can produce provided that lads can get in and do the work. I think people are getting carried away with the Skrtel talk. He is doing what he does best and he seems to crop up and score goals at crucial times. If you told me that my club had Agger, Skrtel, Sahko, and Kolo Toure to choose from I wouldn't say no. A wing back that can play both sides for cover would be nice. I would like to know what people think of Martin Olsson of Norwich or Nathaniel Clyne of Southampton? Both somewhat young, both had a season at the top?

If you had read this far I appreciate it. Just how I feel about the transfer window and how we need a little more experience but we don't want to pay through the teeth for it. Xabi would be the ideal experience for all the young spanish lads.

Much love from a Kiwi Red. xo

Lol, who else on that bench would do shit? I mean really, Alberto isn't the right choice for this game, Cissokho and Aspas are both shit players, and Rossiter might be a god, but I highly doubt he would be able to do much either.

The real issue is 0 squad depth. I've been saying this every fucking game, even with Gerrard back in the squad, we just are not good enough to be winning the premier league. We have a lot of inexperienced players, and we just don't have the subs/depth required to come on top in matches like this.

If we reverse the scores, who does Mourinho bring on? Mata, Schurrle? Yep. Who do we bring on? Even if Gerrard was back in Allen's spot, and Sturridge back in over Sterling, there is still no one that is good enough to come on and make a real difference. Sterling *can*, and he impressive for his age, but that means fuck all, we want and need points.

I would ditch Aspas and Cissokho ASAP, two players I would never like to see in red again. I guess the other issue is how shit our team is at shooting. I mean holy fuck, if Suarez or Sturridge have an off game, we are so fucked. Sterling/Coutinho/Henderson can only put away the easiest of chances, and while they have had some nice shots every now and then, Coutinho especially needs to be hitting the back of the net every couple of games.

* People's sense of humour
* The British stiff upper lip really is a thing. Germans get hysterical over the smallest things.
* British people are highly pragmatic problem solvers who deal with huge obstacles without batting an eye-lid. 
* Mid-range restaurants. In Germany, cheap restaurants are of very good quality, you can get a very good main course for €4.50, but it's difficult to spend that little big extra and get something extra special like you can in London.
* Technology. Britain is technologically advanced compared to Germany. Most places you can't even pay with debit card here for example. We don't have Netflix yet or anything like that either. We're very web-oriented in the UK, websites in Germany are awful with really bad usability and friendless issues.
* Huge supermarkets with massive selections. Due to all of the cultures that have come to the UK, you have the best supermarkets in the world with a wide selection of items from many different places. My local supermarket in Germany has 2 types of curry paste in tiny jars that cost €3,99 each. You can get almost everything in UK supermarkets. In Germany, the fruit and vegetable selection is of good quality but of limited types, you can't get even get butternut squash.
* The UK is very unbureaucratic, your tax return if you're self-employed is just one page. In Germany it's a fucking nightmare.
* NHS

Because of the events of ""The Day of The Doctor"" and the Time Lord's subsequent intervention in this episode, The Doctor's death on Trenzalore never happened. It's not the first time something ""set in stone"" was re-written, but it does leave several plot holes that are eating at me... especially when you consider:

[Spoiler Description](#s ""That the entire reason The Doctor and Clara are traveling together, is because he was searching for her, after her death in The Snowmen and Asylum of The Daleks. The only reason there were multiple versions of Clara all throughout the timeline... including the one who would tell the *~very first~* Doctor to take a different TARDIS than the one he was intending to at the start of his adventures... is because she entered The Doctor's Time Scar... which was present on Trenzalore, because he died trying to defend Christmas during his centuries of battle with invading forces. But, because he never died on Trenzalore, there was no Time Scar or dying TARDIS to house it... so how did Clara still end up at multiple points in The Doctor's timeline, if the very thing that allowed this all to happen... never did?"")

That's what's been bothering me.

And I must admit, it's not the conclusion to the Trenzalore story arc I was expecting... I really was never *~expecting~* The Doctor to actually ever die... but something just seems really... off... about how four years of this story got wrapped up with a simple Deus ex machina, in a one hour episode.

And that whole: ""Oh, hay guise, here's another regeneration cycle lol!"" thing was... kind of cheap, in a way, to solve Smith's incarnation being ""the final Doctor""... but, it's what we ended up with. I know full well the BBC would never let Doctor Who end... it's a massive cash cow for them, and a huge part of British television... but it still seemed like they were doing their best to make us think ""Oh no! The Doctor might really be finished!!!"" for the entire arc, only to pull a solution out of their hat in the final ten minutes.

true,doom_halo,null,null,"I'm a third year currently looking for my 4th year house, these are the things I'm looking for:

* Mould around windows. This is something that isn't normally the landlords fault; most mould is caused by tenants behaviour. But it can sometimes be a sign of other things ie airbricks being blocked up causing a lack of ventilation.

* Agency Fees - Sometimes it's better not to go through an agency to avoid these and contact landlords directly - our students union have their own agency that doesn't charge and all the landlords are accredited (although that doesn't mean much)

* ASK THE CURRENT TENANTS IF THEY ARE IN what they think about the landlord. What problems have they had (as almost everyone has some kind of problem), how long it took to be resolved, were there concerns about the quality of the repairs done? Are there outstanding issues that haven't been resolved?

* Rent cost: This one is pretty obvious. I have friends paying ~£85 a week which is pretty extortionate; I pay £67 a week and know people paying as low as £50 a week in exactly the same area. There's obviously some variation in quality, but don't go and sign for the first house you go and look around because you might see something better that costs less. Agencies can be very pushy, saying things like ""Oh, we've had 3 people look around this today and everyone really likes it, if you want it you better put the deposit down to keep it!"" Don't feel pressured, and keep a level head. Wherever you are, there're almost certainly more houses than there are students - I know people who've left it to two weeks before term starts and have had rent dropped to very low prices and had a 9 month contract to keep the cost down, and postgraduate students who don't go into halls have to find places on very short notice normally, so don't worry too much.

* See what other people say about the letting agencies - they will rip you off a bit because they are there to make a profit - the one I went with for my second year didn't charge admin fees but definitely skimped on carrying out work to an acceptable standard. If one does have a good reputation, it's probably fairly well deserved because you'll hear more about negative experiences people have had than the positive. 

* Houses from Letting Agencies - is the property managed by the landlord or the Letting Agency? Some houses will be owned by a landlord who pay the letting agency an amount of money to deal with complaints/problems.

* Private Halls - Depends on the cost. Some of them can be very expensive but you have the benefit of not having to deal with sorting out internet/bills as it's all included. You won't have them doing things like putting the cost up midway through the year either; I signed up for Sky Broadband in my house and within the first two months they added an extra £3.50 onto the bill. In the area I live, Virgin Media internet is awful, even on the higher cost packages, so that's one thing to consider, especially if you're big downloaders. Ask around! Also, you can guarantee at least a basic level of service if you're in one, landlords can be very unhelpful at times.

* Are any bills included? Some landlords will include water in the cost of the rent.

* Can you get no/discounted rent over summer? Seems to vary a lot by city, a lot of my friends pay nothing over summer but this is quite uncommon in the area I live in.

If you're by any chance at the University of Birmingham and are looking around in Selly Oak/Harborne then I can give you some more specific advice!

Edit: Also, make sure the people you've arranged to live with really are people you want to live with!

In my opinion, it cheapened the regeneration, and ruined the mood. They could have just as easily done all that bit in the first few minutes of ""The Eleventh Hour"" (and, yes, it still bothers me, even four years later). But I digress.

Capaldi's quick bit about his Kidneys wasn't too much, and didn't directly ruin the tone of Smith's departure. It was funny, without being forced... and even made me question *~why~* he didn't like the colour of his kidneys (and had me wondering if all those pink marshmallows might have somehow had an effect on him, because he's a Time Lord).

I still did a better job than plenty of politics and newspapers who usually don't mention any of this facts as they are the ones who want THEIR agenda filled. I obviously can't also put figures which can't be calculated easily - someone professional should do it but it seems they don't always do. 

I can also say that your post wasn't really objective either. Why? Look below at possible counter points:

* if jobs within certain industry are filled they may contribute towards development of those companies, subsequently increasing employment and paid taxes, nin;
* it's usually easier for Brits to go higher, mainly because they have ideal English language proficiency. A Brit plumber employee becomes employer, people become supervisors, managers or take courses and take better paid jobs. Don't forget that not lazy Brit will always be a better employee than an immigrant, especially that on those higher jobs there is a very strong force limiting number of people who can join it;
* What about good old competition? It is not about working for nothing. It's usually about working for little less, little better. Isn't it how companies fight with each other by better selection of workforce and offering higher standard of services? I bet plenty of people just are lazy to compete with immigrants and prefer moaning rather than investing in themselves and moving their asses;
* ""Sudden influx""? 1.5% max of total UK population increase in the period of 10 years. Is this such sudden from Eastern Europe?
* ""Services can't cope? Build more schools, build more clinics etc. If there are so many local children, their parents obviously pay Council Tax (more money to councils to expand). Building new schools means more jobs for local tradesman and local teachers. Even if they have to finish ""specialist"" course it takes what, 2 or 3 years for being a teacher? It's certainly not 10 or 20!
* Black market - you think that Brits will ALWAYS report? Wouldn't be so sure about this, especially knowing that so many Brits do benefits fraud (heard or read stories about ""disabled"" playing football and similar?). Black market may be still less but compare it without migration from outside of EU and illegal immigrants and you will see that if something UK should sort that problem first.

Certainly, [in the past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCrone_report) it was thought Scotland could do *very* well from independence. And, to an extent, this is still the case (there is, apparently, even more oil off the West coast.)

Scotland has the potential, with good governance and some luck, to still do very well with independence. If it left in 2014 it would lead to a period of 10-20 years of things being very economically ropey, but after this time things would settle down and the benefits start coming home.

Alternatively, if Scotland where to have a few decades where more and more powers where devolved, and problems that cropped up where dealt with, leading to full independence I feel the impact of this transitional period would be greatly reduced.

On the other hand, I also feel Scotland could well remain within the UK, but only with significant constitutional reform. This is, in fact, what most of the UK sorely needs. Personally, I would like to see a move to the American or German system of federalisation, with strong, devolved parliaments for the South of England, North of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; with a weak UK parliament above all dealing with nationwide issues, foreign relations, war and some taxes.

I live in a London borough which has changed very rapidly even over the past five years - a lot of people in their 20s and 30s with so-called ""professional jobs"" have moved in largely as lodgers and renters. They keep completely to themselves and I sometimes call them ""the identical people"" because, at least on what is visible from the outside, there is very little variation. I feel sorry for them because it is likely that they will always be rootless and never own a house, at least here, because of the now-astronomical prices.

It is dispiriting, on a run in the local park, not to have people make eye contact or nod as you pass them.

There were communal events, but they have largely died off although there are attempts to keep some going, and those that remain feel artificial and forced.

There is also some tension, which the local council in particular tries to play down, between the (on average relatively rich) newcomers and the (on average relatively poor) people who have been around for 10 or 20 years.

I found out recently that the turnover of people in my London borough is 36 per cent.

The graph on that page only goes as far as to 1971 (70s 4-6%, 80s 8-12%). I'm pretty sure going back 40 years is enough for any such comparison? Or maybe I should go back (looking now at other [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_Kingdom) ) to 1932 (unemployment 70%) or after II World War where it was very low but because of thousands of Brits killed in the war and parts of country ruined?

&gt;However it causes a massive unmet demand for housing that drove up the price of housing and in part lead to the crash.

Massive? Lead to the crash. I don't know why I bother replying to you. Massive being the most 1.5% of total UK population? And this lead to a crash, not WORLD's FUCKING CRISIS? Well done!

Had to check this.

When you put together the 2-parters and remember that she wasn't really in ""The Lodger"" for the most part, we can credit her with being in 26 stories.

Romana was only in 17, counting Shada, although I'm not sure it's a fair comparison since stories ran about twice as long on average back then.  Pretty much every story Romana was in was as long as a 2-parter from the new series (if not longer.)

Sarah Jane Smith was in 19, counting her guest appearances in the post-2005 show, but again, how do you compare any of the Amy stories to the whopping five times that Sarah was in a 6-part story?  Plus, if you count her spin-off (which did have occasional tie-ins to the DW plot), she definitely trumps all companions for the most screen time in-character.

But yeah, Amy's run was huge, as companions go.  Also, she gets to become the Doctor's mother-in-law.

EDIT:  Although you could argue that each major story arc in the new series is actually one story each.  Even if you penalize Romana the same way for the Key To Time and E-Space arcs, and do likewise with Sarah &amp; Harry trans-mat beaming back and forth to the same space station, Romana &amp; Sarah still jump to the lead if you do that.",0,1388403312,null,0,1388439020,0,ceda20w,t3_1tztdt,t1_ceda20w,t1_ced91pj,null,1427932925,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

This isn't an attack on cyclists, it's an effort to reinforce that cycling is safe and accessible, that it's not a dangerous pursuit only for the 'elite' cyclists.

&gt;1. How many cyclists are there in Great Britain?

&gt;- 43% of the population owns or has access to a bicycle.

&gt;- Around 8% of the population (3 million people) cycle 3 times a week or more, in total 34% of the population (20 million people) say they cycle once a year or more.

&gt;- According to the 2011 Census 762,334 people use a bicycle as the main form of transport for getting to work in England and Wales, up by 111,357 from 2001. In addition, another 50,000 or so use bikes as part of a longer journey.

&gt;2. Is cycle use increasing?

&gt;- The mileage cycled in the UK is up 20% over the last 15 years from 4 billion kms in 1998 to 5 billion kms in 2012.

&gt;- Cycle use increases have been higher in urban areas: in London cycle use on main roads over the 2012/13 financial year was 176% higher than in 2000.

Before you say I'm incorrect, try reading the fucking Student Loan and UK.Gov website.

[Here you go, directly from the Student Loans website, dumbass..](http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678784&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL)

&gt; You pay 9% of anything you earn over the threshold of £21,000 per year.

&gt;How to work out your monthly repayment amount

* Take away £21,000 from your annual salary before tax

* Work out 9% of the remainder

* Divide that figure by 12

* Round down to the nearest pound

&gt; For example, if you were earning £30,000 per year:

* 30,000 – 21,000 = 9,000

* 9% of 9,000 = 810

* 810 / 12 = 67.5

* Round down

* So your monthly student loan repayment would be £67.

And from the FAQ:

&gt; Normally any outstanding loan you have will be written off 30 years after it becomes eligible to be repaid.

But it won't, ultimately, and when they do I am very doubtful they will change for the better. In this case the short term is irrelevant, the long term is what matters. And so far the UK government, Better Together are failing entirely to either bring about or promise any beneficial change for the future. 

The point I'm making with China is that the UK government is either unable or *unwilling* to invest outside of London. The former is bad, the latter is nothing short of abysmal. In and of itself foreign investment is fine, it is *dependency* on foreign investment that I worry about.

&gt;We dont rely on the French for aircraft

We do, remember? We sold all the harriers to the US, now we need the French to man our aircraft carriers. Meaning we cannot go to war without them. I do not push for an efficient war machine, by any means, but it is a dangerous precedent. How long before we cannot even meet our defence need without foreign help.

What I want is simple. Self sufficiency. I want the UK to be able to pull its own poor, hungry and unemployed out of their current situation. Time and time again I have been severely disappointed, to the extent I come to regard this as a lost cause. So instead, I will settle for an independent Scotland. Small perhaps, maybe not relevant globally as in the past, but crucially better, richer and more confident then it is now.

I'm not interested in how things will stay the same, I want to hear how things will get better.

Yellow is attack, white is when defending. 
Henderson has the arrow there because Coutinho dont bother to defend. So it would be hard for agger to defend one on one as a CB. 

Coutinho would go to the red box where he could pass the ball to Sterling who would run the channels or Suarez. I was hoping that duo Suarez, Sterling would atract defenders and make space for each other so Coutinho could use his geniality.

The weakest link would be Alberto. He could do Allen job, he is more creative than him what is a + but Im not sure if he is strong enough to fight for balls.

Sure, you can argue that.

But why have Commission officials repeatedly given the same stance?

&gt;I didn't suggest that Scotland would get any special treatment, but you have to remember that even after an independence vote Scotland would still be part of the UK, and in the EU for a couple of years, so Scotland would be negotiating from within at that point, which is rather different from applying from without.

Sorry, I don't follow. You're saying that Scotland would not get special treatment, but that applying within would be different from applying externally?

Could you explain that a little more?

&gt;And the EU simply does not have a history of ejecting members or refusing membership, especially not to a a fairly well off country. 

This situation has never arisen before though.

Obviously at one point every toy is unusable because its to old. Now there are certain children who break their toys really fast even if they dont want that. Most of the times those children are really succesfull children and they put a lot of pressure on their toys.


There are really mature children in comparision to their succes. Like Manure. This child doesnt break his toys fast. Maybe it had this ability because of his father Ferguson who passed away sadly. Or Barca, because it has a big incestious family who watches out for their toys. 


But the glorious child CFC sadly for one reason or another breaks his toys fast. So what is the solution to this problem? It loans out their most promising young toys to other more calm children to let them become excellent toys. Yeah they would become exellent toys if CFC would have played with them too, but its to dangerous because at their young age they would break fast and CFC couldnt play anymore with them.

I am just a bit concerned that you have no idea how lucky you are. 

Most of us do not have this kind of deal. Most people if they are lucky enough to have a pension scheme at all, will be on a defined contributions scheme rather than the CARE one you are being moved to. We get no guarantees of our retirement income and just have wait and see what we can buy with our pot. 

Buying a retirement income of £30,000 a year  at 65 will cost us £500,000. At 55 that money gets us £25,000 a year. (Grabbed from Nationwide's annuity calculator). Did you consider this in your plans?

Retiring early is expensive. At 55 you are likely to live longer and will have paid less in. Is it a scam really?

true,java8888,null,null,"""Secondly, blame economy and rich employers, who don't wish to employ for more.""

The economy isn't a thing we can blame, it is the sum of parts. Aspects such as mass immigration contribute to that sum, which is why we consider it's benefit vs costs.

You're also suggesting that employers don't wish to pay more, which is incorrect as it suggests that wages are determined solely by the employers. In truth, employers are subject to the economy as well. If wages are going up around them, they too have to increase wages to retain staff. If wages are falling, it is possible that they will have to cut staffing costs in order to continue to sell the product/service at a competitive rate.

An influx of labour inevitably pushes down wages by providing greater competition for pay. However, an increased work force provides for greater business opportunity and lower wages enable more start ups. So, immigration pushes wages down in one sense, but increases opportunity and economic prosperity in another. The debate is, which side of the scale is heavier? 

""However, take into account that plenty of employers simply can't afford paying more""

That's completely subjective, in essence, you've made that up. Could be true, could not be. You can't build on sand, nor can you do the same with an argument.

We also need to consider whether what is good for the economy is always good for the people. Society is more complex than how much you earn and what you can buy. Though you'd be forgiven for not noticing this, as Politicians rarely seem to discuss anything but maximising money for the few.

Maybe the writers figure that was boring, or maybe they feel that the show is established enough that we don't need that from a companion anymore and they want to do something more interesting with the characters.

As far as the new era companions go, I like Wilf and Craig because they're just normal dudes. And even though Rose turned into Bad Wolf, she started out as just a normal girl trying to figure it out.

I know it happened with the old show as well, but I'm more familiar with new Who and it seems to be a trend. The Girl Who Waited, The Last Centurion, The Wrong-Time-Around-Wife, The Impossible Girl.

I've made it up? If I did then I can say that lowering wages by immigrants is made up and subjective as well. Why? Who decides what is decent earning for certain job? Why isn't it being looked from other points that maybe some expect to earn more than they should for certain job?

I don't understand what you're trying to say. If economy improves than in general unemployment goes down, government gets more money from people and spends them on public services provided.

For nearly a year in London: Lewis Holtby waiting at Tottenham in the League Permians for the big breakthrough

 
Bild am Sonntag: *Mr. Holtby , how would you sum after a year at Tottenham from?*

Lewis Holtby (23): *At the moment, for me it is sporting a constant up and down Despite the great competition and my relatively few games I have also achieved this season has nine assists and three goals. That's a good rate. However, I would often be in the starting from biting me and reluctant to keep coming back to the heated bench.*

Bild am Sonntag: *Louis van Gaal to become your coach ...*

Lewis Holtby: *I would have no problem if van Gaal comes. I've finally survived Felix Magath (laughs).*

Bild am Sonntag: *What else do you like about England?*

Lewis Holtby: *I play for a top club in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Recently we played in Fulham, as the guest cabin is 10 square meters in size, because you can hardly move.

true,millimole,null,null,"My heart says 'great' but my head says that it's a poor use of money. It's the answer to several wrong questions. The main issue is claimed to be capacity in and out of London - as Iomex has aid one partial solution is greater capacity trains (and the accompanying larger capacity stations), but better use, and upgrading of existing lines, such as the Midland Mainline, and Chiltern lines could also be used to deal with any capacity issues - if they really exist.

Equally HS2 is very much a London-centric project, which will do nothing for the regions, despite the politicians claims. It will make communion TO London easier, but will not help move business out to the West Midlands or the North. Drunk_online suggests improving regional lines in the north! but I would go further and say that some of the money could be better spent on several good quality East-West corridor lines (look how dire Norwich - Liverpool is).

Certainly the amount of freight being carried is a problem for the development of passenger capacity as Numnuts.... says, so better use of the railway as a 24 hour resource will be needed. I think the upgrade of the route west out of Felixtowe to the midlands has been a very positive move, and now it needs to be followed up,with doubling routes, or parrelel routes north-south. The anorak in me likes the idea of reviving the old Great Central route as freight route linked to HS1 - but realisticly I can't ever see it happening.

I don't think there is the political will to engage with the controversies surrounding the route of HS2; I don't think there is the long term vision to provide the capital to build HS2, and I don't think it's needed.

true,java8888,null,null,"I don't think we're disagreeing, I just think you're misunderstanding how the economy works - you cannot blame 'the economy'. The economy is just the outcome of a thousand big decisions and millions of little ones. When you choose to buy your weekly shop at Tescos rather than a local supermarket, it is a decision which impacts the economy, albeit in a minimal way. 

So, my first assertion is that your argument that we can blame the economy, as if it were some sort of being or a handful of decisions, is incorrect. It'd be like blaming the ocean for sinking a ship. 

Working regulations are part of the economy, as is immigration. That is why I wrote ""Aspects such as mass immigration contribute to that sum, which is why we consider it's benefit vs costs.""

I agree with your sentiment about tax avoidance, but that's a different issue to immigration and to wages. I'm sure there are times when they cross over, however, tax avoidance is largely so profit can be increased WITHOUT reducing wages. 

""Who decides what is decent earning for certain job?""

No-one and everyone. It's the same principle which runs along all consumables. In basic terms, it's what is the minimum they will work for vs what is everybody else paying? 

""I don't understand what you're trying to say""

What is good for the economy is not always what is good for the people. I wrote it like that to sound poetic, but it is flawed. Essentially, what I mean is, don't be mislead into believing that the economy is synonymous with business interests. 

Below are a few key points for food for thought, regarding immigration. I am not saying I believe them. The following supposes mass immigration, which includes a large number who work in the lower paying sectors.

Higher levels of immigration reduce wages for the lowest in society but increase profit margins at the top. This money is spread around the business class via shares which pay out in dividends. This money is then used to buy more property and invest in more businesses meaning the rich get richer, the poor get poorer. This is a problem when this divide converts into land ownership. When the upper/upper middle class own the properties and the lower / lower middle have to rent, we find ourselves in a difficult situation of, in all reality, class oppression, despite it not being intentional. 

The overall economic strength of the country may improve in terms of statistics. There may now be more jobs, more businesses and more money floating around. However, just because that money is floating, it doesn't mean everybody is getting some.

But it doesn't matter that only the richest get the profit because lower wages means greater purchasing power because services can be provided. So we all benefit. Lower wages are counter-balanced by lower costs.

Except we're not really seeing that. We're seeing the economic boom of a few large businesses take over entire sectors. Your gas, your electricity, your water, your phone contracts, your internet providers, your insurers, your grocers and so on. They are all controlled by a relatively small number of big businesses, which are in turn owned by even bigger businesses. The rise of the business leviathans means we find ourselves in a cage and we're told that if we want to get the key, we have to pay whatever price they demand.  

So cost of living is actually going up in areas, for reasons beyond immigration but wages are going down for the poorest, in part, because of immigration.

But it's not just about the money. Schools, Welfare and the NHS now need to be able to look after a massive spike in the economy. Your own statistics suggest 700,000 East Europeans stayed in the UK. That's a very large city which has sprung out of nowhere, all requiring food, education, housing etc. alongside the jobs which they need to pay for these things.

The natural thing for people going to a foreign country to do is seek comfort. So they do. I know I would. They seek areas which resemble home, whether this area reminds you of Poland, Pakistan, China or Spain. It doesn't matter, people get homesick and being in a community where home comforts are around mitigates that.

So little communities pop up, which are fine in themselves but become a little harder to integrate when instead of being little, they become all encompassing because the mass levels of migration means whole new communities can arrive within a short space of time. When you needn't learn English, when you don't need to interact with the English, you don't fully integrate with  England. 

The English spot this and feel threatened. The English misread the immigrant's desire to mitigate their homesickness and instead see it as a rejection of English ways. They begin to become spiteful towards them. The foreign community responds in likeness. 

We find ourselves with a problem.

In regards to Gatiss, he's written some amazing episodes. The Idiot's Lantern is one of my all time favourite episodes and Night Terrors was excellent! He's also a superb actor having played Professor Lazarus and Gantok in The Wedding of River Song. Imagine having a head writer who also casts himself! A bit self serving, I know, but Gatiss is awesome! He's also impeccably close to Moffat and totally proved himself writing An Adventure in Space and Time single handedly. If they happen to be looking for a new head writer any time soon, which I think they will be, Gatiss seems the perfect man for the job!

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Lucas is the only player nailed on for one of the deeper/holding spots.  The other three can fit into the other deeper spot or play the advanced role (which they've done all season when we play with 4 at the back).  The reason Henderson/Allen play that advanced role is because their defensive workrate allows them to press and pressure the ball in a way that someone like Coutinho/Alberto doesn't and this pressure is very important to the way we defend.  Otherwise we'd be seeing Coutinho through the middle all the time.  I also wouldn't call it a CAM really since defensively it doesn't work like one.  Whoever is playing there is generally still tasked with recovering deep to defend, they just sit higher up the pitch in possession and have a particular onus on making those long runs from deep to join in the transition play.  It's really more of an energetic box to box role with an emphasis on attacking.

We have bad depth in the CM positions.  When they're all fit we have 1 sub available to cover 3 positions.  Coutinho slides into the middle when we're chasing a lead and need to be more offensive, but that upsets our normal balance through the middle.  If Henderson or Gerrard end up unavailable for Hull then we have 2 fit CMs with no subs.

We aren't really playing with a central AM at this point even without Sturridge.  One player tends to be in a more advanced position, but he's hardly limited in his defensive duties (Henderson has been the one playing there and he's still running all up and down the pitch).  When we do play with a central AM (typically when playing with 3 at the back) we have reasonable depth with Coutinho, Alberto, and Aspas (more of a forward but BR hasn't been afraid to deploy him in a bit of a deeper role when Coutinho was out) available.

While we need to build HS2, we also need to upgrade the existing railway network - the electrification programme that is happening now is long overdue really. Lines like the Midland and Great Western should have been electrified decades ago really.

I think the arguments about capacity on the WCML are being framed wrongly. It's not about a train leaving London half full, it's about how many trains you can run on a route in a one hour period. Ideally HS2 will reduce the WCML to a freight and commuter railway if it is built.
