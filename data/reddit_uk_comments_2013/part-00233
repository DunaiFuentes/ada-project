 I do, however, think he should have a deeper role and dont think CAM is his position. He was too deep at times and left Soldado deserted in the box, especially if Paulinho couldn't get there. His work rate is important during these tough away games but Eriksen should always get the nod against teams who 'park the bus'.

I woud like to see Holtby, Paulinho and Eriksen as the midfield three during the home games gainst the likes of west brom, and stoke because the creatvity is more important in these games, whereas defending takes a back seat for long spells.

There's nothing ironic about the Stones playing there, or the BBC covering it - the kids are in smaller events that don't cost a mortgage payment for a ticket and they're not being televised by a state TV station.

He identifies there being no cultural movement since punk that's penetrated the mainstream consciousness, but we could argue about dance music culture (which the baby boom generation tried to legislate out of existence in the UK with anti-rave laws as it was happening if you remember). They'd say ""well, there's no political meaning behind dance music"" which is sort of dance music's entire point. 

But even then the politics of punk came out of a time when kids were able to seize power for themselves and actually effect the world they were living in - something that's increasingly difficult, and that IS because of the effects of the baby boom generation pulling the ladder up after themselves.

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Depends how you define 'taxing a house'. Any capital gains would be taxed, allowances are taxable, expenses are more complicated as they are supposed to represent expenditure that you otherwise wouldn't incur.

People don't (on the whole) object to an MP claiming for a cost he's incurred. The issue is when the expenses are seen as a 'top up' for an already high salary, and that the expenses being incurred are out of all proportion to what the ordinary man in the street would consider reasonable.

An MP should have his main home in his constituency. This he should be expected to maintain out of his salary, less a sensible amount for the bit he uses mainly or solely for his MPs work - just like anyone who works from home (although the employee/employer/self-employed/contractor analogy is tricky to maintain, but we'll run with it). An MP might also need an office/surgery, but he doesn't get to claim for that and a contribution to his home.

MPs also work in Westminster. That's a simple fact. It's unreasonable to expect them to commute outside of a certain distance. In which case, it is reasonable to maintain a base within striking distance of Westminster. This should be a modest one/two bed affair, rented from the state. If an MP wishes not to use that facility, then they pay the difference.

The story posted suggests that MPs are using the allowance to heat rambling piles in the country that should, by any measure, be funded out of their own pocket. 

tl;dr If MPs didn't take the piss, nobody would begrudge them their reasonably incurred expenses. But they have, so we do.",0,1383501436,null,0,false,0,cd5uhlz,t3_1pssxh,t1_cd5uhlz,t1_cd5tziz,null,1428876297,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Not sure why pulling Townsend would help us as he has consistently been one of our better players on the pitch (granted today was not a great performance),   I would prefer that we try Lamela or Townsend on the left over Gylfi as they are more rounded players but Gylfi has netted a few goals which is something considering how poor we have been scoring and creating chances.

The thing with our attack is that defenses are playing a very specific way and so far we have done nothing to convince anyone to change away from it.  Teams seem to have their left sided fullback leaving the inside path available, on the other side of the pitch the fullbacks are presenting the outside as an available choice and then they stack the middle.

The end result on this is that teams are willing to risk us taking shots from 20 yards out to take away the shots from 10 yards and they are offering the left side of the pitch in order to shore up the inside of the pitch.  Means that the middle of the pitch is crowded and congested which takes away opportunities unless you utilize your width.

For us, Gylfi isn't a natural winger and doesn't have the skillset to take advantage of the width on the left on his own, Lennon isn't suited to play on the left (not to mention Chadli has been plagued with injury and Lamela hasn't been settling) and we haven't had a left back who can help with that width.  Means we become very narrow on the left.  On the right it seems as if Walker has been making fewer overlapping runs and Townsend is taking the path of least resistance (as well as what is asked from an inverted winger) by cutting inside.  Means we are becoming very narrow on the right as well.

Basically teams have determined a way to make our attack stagnate due to our system and lack of personnel (due to health and form) to potentially take advantage of the defensive setup. Hopefully we will see Rose coming back and Lamela recapturing his form so that we can start to take advantage of what is in front of the attack.  

If we can start mixing more true wing play with inverted wing play and a true left back and left sided player (even inverted winger) if we can attack on the left it take pressure off the right and middle of the pitch and opens up the attack as a whole.",0,1383501507,null,0,false,0,cd5uijl,t3_1ptf39,t1_cd5uijl,t3_1ptf39,null,1428876285,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"The main thing you want to be looking at is the best rate you can get with a 5%, 10% and 15% mortgage. If you can get a mortgage where you can overpay without any penalties, then the interest rate difference is the only main thing to be concerned about.  

Then, say you can get a 5% mortgage at 5% deposit, and a 3% mortgage at 15% deposit, work out how much it will cost to have a 5% mortgage by adding  
- 2% (the difference) on 85% of the value of the property plus  
- 5% on 10% of the value of the property (as you'd be paying no interest on this if you were at a higher deposit).  

So the cost is (0.02 * 0.85) + (0.05 * 0.10) = 0.022, or 2.2% of the value of the property. Given that the difference in deposit is only 10%, you're needing that 10% to make that whole 2.2% itself to make it worthwhile, so multiply by 10, you need a 22% return in this case to make it worthwhile.   

To work out when it is worthwhile, take your expected return (12%), and subtract the interest rate for the lower deposit (so, 12% - 5% = 7%). Divide that by 10 (because that 10% deposit needs to cover the whole return) to get 0.7%. So if you'd get a 5% rate for a 5% deposit, the rate for the 15% deposit must be no lower than 4.3% to make the lower deposit a better prospect (on interest alone).

Both links, although referencing capital punishment cases and costs in the US, are probably the closest thing we can get to research in relation to any potential implementation of capital punishment here in the UK.

If there is significant evidence to show that capital punishment leads to even *one* case of wrongful execution, I cannot see why it should even be considered as an alternative to life imprisonment.

The Desmond Tutu quote at the end of the Question Time video (posted above) adds the third counter argument to introducing capital punishment: even in cases where a murderer may be convicted via a guilty plea and irrefutable evidence, a life for a life is revenge, not justice.

She was a good leader in that she kept the tory party ferociously in line and nearly a quarter of a century after she died there is yet to be a leader who has stepped out from her shadow. She showed immense nerve and backbone whether you think that is good or bad in her policies and in not backing down (giving the speech at the party conference in 1984 just after the Brighton hotel had been bombed by the IRA.). There wa a poll in the late 80s I remember seeing that while many people disliked her an equal number respected her.

As for her policies it depends where you stand to put it mildly. Was she driven by events or by ideology. Certainly the shuttiNg down of the mines had begun under labour as had the turning of grammar schools into comprehensives but the vivacity with which she sold off national infrastructure was alarming to many within her own party as well as without - former 'one nation' Tory leader Harold Macmillan likened it to 'selling off the family silver'. You could argue that investing in national infrastructure would have beggared the uk's spending yet also that it has left critical infrastructure in the hands of foreign governments and companies and has created monopolistic situations. The fact that succeeding governments continued these policies shows either that the uk has struggled to find alternate methods of funding or updating infrastructure or that tey are singularly narrow minded

Regardless of the policies the legacy has been quite prominent. Financial services are now one of our largest industries, which has provided a huge amount of tax income yet meant we suffered more than any nation in the last financial crisis due to a lack of regulation from governments of all stripes. Wealth continues to be unevenly distributed across the uk and her inability to 'get' Scotland was probably one of the greatest spurs to devolution and the Scottish independence movement. Any examination of her policies has to take this into account

As for her personally it depends who you read. She was a statesman of the old sort - she brought her own cutlery to downing street and when her son got lost at the Dakar rally she brought him home at her own expense. However she had an almost binary trust in authority tha led her to unequivocally support Reagan even though his administration started out ambivalent about the Falklands. Her trust of the police meant they supported her through the miners stokes but meant she didn't question their account of hillsborough which charitably could be said to not damning them in public but also could be said to let them get away with outright lies.

I've tried to be as neutral as possible but thatcher is a vey polarising figure especially north of Birmingham. What has surprised me is how much many people outside of the uk especially Europe respected her. Britain in the 70s was a mess with a three day working week power brownouts and millions of days lost to strikes. Whether this was more the fault of unions politicians or again a cos equine of global economics is by-the-by but many saw her actions as a necessary price to pay. Others thought it was far too harsh

It was conceived of as a learning device. When I was a kid in the 80s my parents bought me a 8bit micro. There was an idea that others would use it too but nobody did, it was just me. I taught myself programming on that thing and went on to build a career from it. We were far from rich and if it broke or something went wrong then it was a serious cost but in terms of the effect it had on others it didn't ultimately matter. Nobody else relied on it for anything. I'd get myself into situations and then get myself out of them and be all the wiser and more knowledgeable for it.  

A lot more families have a computer now because the internet drove home ownership beyond just the geeks and those who used them for work. A lot of kids still get to have computers of their own but very many don't. There's a family computer, and if the kid breaks it or causes problems then that has an effect on everyone else in the house. 

In schools and colleges too there's a conflict between a kid who wants to be able to do anything and the school that kinda wants to allow that but also has to know that the computers will be working at a certain time when a class scheduled to use them starts. 

The Pi is for those kids. It takes a minute or two to start from scratch, there are a plethora of operating systems available for it and every programming language you an imagine. There's very little an interested and motivated kid couldn't use it for.

Don't know about you but I'd be happy with that.
The goals will come, I'm very happy with the way the team is playing, we're slowly gelling and while we're doing that we're not conceding goals or losing many games. After the January window though if things are still like this then I will start to get a little concerned.

simon - feels as though he's invisible (the lack of confidence and ambition shows)

rudy - similar to nathan but focuses on how sometimes he is that (what he wants to be) and wants to separate the sides of him that he feels are dragging him back, personifying them

so based on that, mine would be one of 2 things

- either shape shifting, as per my fear that my body is not good enough

- but most likely it would something that affects others. as someone who used to deal with a lot of bullying nothing gets me more angry than seeing people belittling others, which means i often go out of my way to make the aggressor feel smaller and the victim feel better about themselves

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"There's nothing stopping a Hindu temple from inventing a Hindu design to use. The reason we have a Sikh one is because a Sikh temple designed it.  

The existing religious symbols are a bit problematic given that the main symbols of Hinduism are [this](http://static3.depositphotos.com/1001003/140/i/950/depositphotos_1403442-3D-Silver-Hinduism-Symbol.jpg) and the reverse swastika. 

Hindu nationalists have a troubled relationship with Indian-British relations in WWII as they had a closer relationship with [Germany]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indische_Legion). Indeed our Hindu regiments were mainly comprised of Nepalese Gurkhas rather than Indians. 

This is part of the reason why the British army recruited predominately from the minority Muslim and Sikh populations within India. These groups were often more happy to side with the British than with the Hindu majority when it came to internal conflicts and so they were easier to recruit. 

There were still plenty of Indian Hindu recruits, India being a huge country with a massive population, but they tended to be absorbed in to other regiments and aren't as commemorated in the UK or India. After Indian independence there was a stigma to having volunteered for the British, the same is true of Irish volunteers in WWI and WWII of whom there were many more than was spoken of at the time. 

Even today the Indian Army is about 25% Sikh even though they only make up 2% of the population, this is a legacy of the fact that the modern Indian Army is a continuation of the Army of the British Raj and recruits from the same population centres. 

The Gurkas have a long tradition of using the Poppy on the cross, not as a Christian symbol but as a symbol of membership of the armies of the Commonwealth.

[This link to Amnesty International](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/the-death-penalty-and-deterrence) displays research (conducted by the National Research Council) that shows that when asked ""do executions lower homicide rates?"" 88% said ""No"", 5% said ""Yes"" while 7% expressed no opinion.

Further research (on the same link) also shows that during a decrease in murder rates (per 100,000 people, from 1990-2010) across the US, states in which the death penalty was not enforced dropped at a similar rate and level as states where the death penalty was enforced.

[This article, from the Denver Post,](http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23374844/no-credible-evidence-whether-death-penalty-deters-experts) summarises in pretty good detail, the sides of both arguments and also details why the argument for or against capital punishment may be useless, if based upon a hope of it being a deterrent.

In relation to cost, [this link to a Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2011/09/22/death-and-taxes-the-real-cost-of-the-death-penalty/) weighs up the potential cost benefits of a system that does not seek the death penalty, with links to the numbers supplied as links within the piece.

[This link to Amnesty (again)](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-cost) summarises the potential savings (or the added cost of a system that seeks the death penalty) with links to the numbers within the page. (The link to the Kansas research is broken, however I have located it [here](http://www.kslpa.org/docs/reports/04pa03a.pdf) )

[The BBC published an article in 2011,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14402195) following a number of campaigns and high-profile calls to at least debate the possibility of a return for the death penalty.

Polls usually show a British public that favours a return slightly more than those who would oppose bringing back the death penalty, however these polls frequently reduce the argument to ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, rather than bringing about anything like a proper debate or discussion about the issues.

The only other thing I would add at this point, is that the US is the only developed, Western nation that still contains states that may implement the death penalty and I am not aware of any others that are seeking to bring it back.

**I would recommend them because:**

- Of the camaraderie.  Most of your fellow employees on the shop floor [fellow retail operatives and supervisors] are fantastic, and there's a real team spirit. Everyone's inclusive, friendly, and even though it's tiring, there's such an energy about the place.

- The customers. I know I mentioned them in the ""would not recommend"" section, but most of them are absolutely fantastic, and as long as you're not bad at telling a few jokes and keeping a smile on your face, you'll get a few fantastic compliments from them and will be remembered along the way.

In a situation like this the decision has to be made very quickly so it can be very rushed as there's an expectation from fans, the referee and broadcasters that the game should continue no matter what.  And Lloris was insistent he should continue, which can cloud the judgement even if you're aware he was not in the best state of mind to be making these decisions.

Season 6: the doctor gets killed and not killed, yay, paradox explodes all of time, but that's ok, paradoxes are cool. Plus, I was shocked and amazed that the doctor faked his own death. I totally didn't see that coming at all.

Season 7: the impossible girl is a result of the biggest paradox ever, apparently. But that's ok, paradoxes are cool.

I'm going to go out on a limb, and suggest that there may be a paradox involved in the special, and that season 8 will also end with an exciting paradox that blows up the universe again.

Apparently Moffat said we're all ""forgotten something"". Which I *hope* means we find out that wibbly-wobbly blew up the TARDIS way back in season 5m because we never go the identity of the voice of the bad guy, and John Hurt's Not-The-Doctor could be that guy, somehow, I suppose. But if it's ""time war"" as most people believe, well, um, I guess we're still not getting an answer.

I suspect that what we've actually forgotten is that Moffat can't write a solution for a problem, so inevitably resorts to ""it's a paradox, isn't that cool? moving on now...""

I'm a sucker for a time-travel paradox story. ""Blink"" was a fantastic example of the genre. But I can't take any ""Day of the Doctor"" speculation seriously unless it includes reference to the inevitable paradox.

&gt; I heard someone say that it could be about the time war. Personally I think that'd be great!

Personally, I don't think that the greatest writing team in all history could come up with something that lives up to the mythology that has been built up.

It's an obvious choice, and I hope that they do something great with it. But it's like a monster movie - showing the characters scared of the creature in the shadows works. Showing the guy in a latex mask with CGI effects tends to make it less of a frightening thing, and more of a problem to be solved.

Right now, we have ""I was there at the fall of Arcadia. Some day I may even come to terms with that."" Next month, we'll have ""we saw the CGI, but it's not like we had more than 10 minutes to get to know the affected characters"".

It took two episodes to show the Daleks and Cybermen invading London. How can a war between the Daleks and Time Lords really fit into a two-hour or less episode? Even if the special is ""about"" the time war, I don't know if they should be trying to show the entire thing.

Why play with 4 plus Lloris to stop one striker, when if we play 3back  with a more midfielders spread out across the park , it will generally not give the opponent wingbacks space/time  to move up (most of our defenders are faster than avg.). We have major issues scoring goals and agreed it isnt only for lack of opportunity, our conversion rate for chances seems low (I dont have actual figures, but having watched quite a number of games this season) because of either lack of accuracy or poor decision making, both of which can be worked on the training ground.  
To say that we are much better  off than expected this far into the season, I do not think is good enough, simply because our talent to produce is higher

Let's look at the middle of the pitch: the opposing team is double-teaming soldado in the middle and holtby/CAM is standing at the middle of the field, around 25 yds out. He was there to provide support in case our inverted winger wants to pass. Alongside him is paulinho, about 30 yards from the opposing goal. He is there to primarily crash the middle without leaving us exposed in the middle. The problem is that he was rarely in a position to take a pass and create a chance. When he crashed the box during a cross, he was usually *just* out of position. Lastly we have the opposite winger outside the top corner of the 18. He is rarely in a position to take a cross, and most crosses that went past soldado ended up goal kicks instead of good 0-range goals. I presume the opposite winger stays far from the action to provide support if the ball were to swing around. Sandro and the center backs are covering back for a counter attack.

Where does this leave us on any given attacking play? We have two players on the wing, 1 player in the box, 2 midfielders just outside the box, and a winger outside the box on the far side. We have 6 players attacking, but they are positioned to protect possession, not strike and score. On the other hand, they have 2 CBs and the opposite fullback in the box, and 3 or 4 midfielders covering the rest of their third. We are Soldado is effectively 3 on 1 and they have clogged up the shooting lanes with bodies. We can easily keep possession and swing it around, but that's a double edged sword. We have the other team all jammed up by their goal, and no amount of passing or creativity will make up for that. Slowing down the tempo makes it worse.

For me, the change we need is to see a bit more counterattack. If it is andros/siggy, soldado, and holtby making a run against their 4 defenders, no need to pass it back and let everyone catch up. Take a chance. The shooting lanes may be a bit more open and since everyone is all off balance and moving, there's a good chance of a pass slipping through and creating some Goaldados or Goaltbys or Sigoaldssons or Goalinhos or w/e. Hell, with his speed we could even see some Vertongoals. At the same time we could either put a second striker or give the alternate winger free reign to stay in the box and help soldado. We have no chance of scoring if we all hang out outside the box and aim blooters willy nilly.",0,1383520315,null,0,false,0,cd626tc,t3_1ptyfp,t1_cd626tc,t3_1ptyfp,null,1428872206,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Only if you're referring to the current novels' range like *The Eyeless* where apparently the Doctor refers to the destruction of Gallifrey. But let's be honest, he spent most of the series before *The End Of Time* lying to his assistants saying Gallifrey had been destroyed.

If you're referring to the between-series books (and I know you're not, but I wanna share the love here), the Time Lords preparing for the future (Davies-undone, the Enemy and Faction Paradox) War made **eight backups** of Gallifrey for a total of nine.

With AVB's system of playing inverted wing forwards it's crucial that we get width and service from our backs. IMO, this is one of the main reasons that we have struggled to score lately.

The other (and possibly most important) reason that we shouldn't do this is that I'm fairly certian that Vertonghen doesn't want to play left back. I believe that he passed up some bigger clubs to play for us specifically because he wanted to be a first choice center back. It's one thing to step up and help the team by playing there because of injuries, but if we tried to make him our first  choice left back I have to believe that he would become unsettled pretty quickly.",0,1383521173,null,0,false,0,cd62j3i,t3_1pu5cy,t1_cd62j3i,t3_1pu5cy,null,1428872046,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

There're many theories.

My favourite is that the John Hurt ""Doctor"" is a regeneration between the 8th and 9th based on his clothes and the enviroment he has been seen in, a battlefield.
So he may be the Doctor that actually took part in the time war and did all these atrocities the Doctor feels so guilty about, and his actions were so bad that all other incarnations of the Doctor simply rejects him and don't aknowledge him as the Doctor.
The 11th Doctor after all said that his actual name isn't important but the name *he has chosen* for himself is, and that everything the John Hurt ""Doctor"" did was not in the name of the Doctor.

Reason being that Walker and, at the moment, Vertonghen are able to get very far forward and support the attack well into the opponents half and they leave behind the two centerbacks and Sandro. 

If the opposition tries to counter those three left behind slow the attack down and give time to the fullbacks to get back. That's essentially what would happen in a 3-5-2 anyways, only Sandro would be left out for another centerback. But you'd still have three left behind with wingbacks dropping back to defend the wide areas and when Spurs were defending in their own half they'd essentially be playing five at the back and one of the centerbacks would regularly step out from the backline anyways.

Playing three at the back wouldn't really change much when teams sit deep against Spurs because it's never actually four defenders marking one striker. It would add a second striker sure, but they would lack width in the attack so the defenses back four could key in more on the two center forwards, which would invite the wingbacks even further forward and leave gaps in the wide spaces for them to counter into and pull the back three apart.

You'd be sacrificing width in the final third too much to gain much from it, again when we're talking about packed in teams with nine players behind the ball.",0,1383521839,null,0,false,0,cd62t1u,t3_1ptzdt,t1_cd62t1u,t1_cd61ov0,null,1428871917,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

I don't think Eriksen is a silver bullet by any means, but I do think we have more forward passing by and large coming from him than from Holtby. Holtby has great pace though, and I think that can really be maximized by coming in late in the game as an impact sub. By the time Eriksen came in, we had a lot less possession and there wasn't much he could do (although I'm pretty sure he had one shot that went straight into a defender, if I'm remembering correctly). 

I don't think Eriksen starting today probably would have resulted in a different outcome though -- he can get the ball in to Soldado, but Soldado's only real chance this match went way over the bar. I do think having two defensive midfielders is not what we need -- like when Dembele came in. Overall though, I think the only thing AVB got really wrong today was letting Lloris stay on.

Okay, so great-grandparents? On her father's side, one English, one Danish, two German. On her mother's side, all English. Break these down and you get ten English (one the son of a Prime Minister), four German, a Dane, and the wonderful Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde, who was born in Transylvania and married a German born in Russia. The Wiki page of the day is [morgonatic marriage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morganatic_marriage). So going back to great-grandparents, Elizabeth II is 5/8 English, 1/4 German, and 1/8 Danish.

There's an interesting side-note, though: George V's mother (so Elizabeth II's great-grandmother) was a princess of Denmark. Her brother, also Danish, was *elected* King of Greece when they ousted the unpopular King Otto. Was Otto Greek? No, he was a prince of Bavaria (a pre-unity German kingdom) and was appointed King of Greece by Great Britain, France, and Russia in the London Conference of 1832 in order to stabilize an unstable Greece, which had broken from the Ottoman Empire with the help of the big three above, and found its (ethnically Greek) governor assassinated. But anyway, the Danish prince who was made King George I of Greece? His grandson is... drumroll... Prince Phillip!

So we get to Philip's ancestry. Parents were Danish and German. Grandparents: the aforementioned Dane, one Russian, a German who rose to the very top of the Royal Navy (yep, the British one), and his wife (also from a German house) who was born in London in the presence of her grandmother, Queen Victoria.

I don't know why on earth a school would choose to use them, they are expensive (£30 + keyboard + mouse + power + SD card + monitor), fiddly (imagine trying to burn 100 SD images), and lets be honest they are slow (Chances are your phone has better specs than it does).

At Raspberry Pi Jams (Meetings for enthusiasts) I see loads of cool projects people have made, but they are all about driving some hardware, which yes does involve coding, but still requires hardware...

What I really don't understand is why schools don't make use of virtualisation software. If when a kid logs into the computers for their computing lesson they can just fire up a virtual box with an Ubuntu install on, then they are in an environment that doesn't matter if gets broken, and is easier and more accessible to develop on, exactly what the Pi aimed for and sadly failed at.

2) If your shop doesn't offer supply of patches, eBay, Google-lined websites and others offer the official patches for purchase as well. The most well-known is The Onionbag in NJ (onionbag.com)  Above shops and T-shirt printers should be able to apply properly using directions.

true,troffle,null,null,"Rassilon appears to be equating existence inside the Lock as not-living.

Gallifrey and the whole of the Time War in the Lock? Absolutely. Give you that one.

Gallifrey destroyed by the Doctor? **Extremely** debatable, to the point where I'd disagree with you and say it wasn't ""**destroyed**"". Your only claim to Gallifrey being destroyed would be to say that being out of the Universe, in the Lock, is ""destroyed"".

Just re-watched both parts of *The End Of Time* to check.

For a start, Rassilon says that 2009 was ""the final days of planet Earth"", when ""everyone had bad dreams"". So I think we can discount a fair amount of what Rassilon says as crappy hyperbole.

The episode *The End Of Time* (part 2) opens with Gallifrey, the dome broken, parts of the Capitol shattered and on fire. He walks into his Council, listening to prophecies about the Doctor, talking about the ""destruction of Daleks and Time Lords alike"", that ""Gallifrey falls"" (which is not the same as destruction). Rassilon refuses and points to Earth as their salvation. That this is the ""last day of the Time War"", ""ending"".

The female Time Lord Councillor (very shortly about to die) mentions that Gallifrey is (somehow) on the edge of the Time War; that at the heart of it, millions are being killed ""every second"", resurrected, to be killed again.

The prophecy then brought to Rassilon's attention mentions that there are two survivors, ""Gallifrey's Children"", to survive beyond the ""Final Day"" (which means it can't be **too** ""final"", so it's just more hyperbole) - the Doctor and the Master.

I previously wrote a lot more summary, but there's not much point and I've removed it. The point is - Gallifrey still existed, broken but existent, inside the Lock. Going back into the Lock is going back into the Time War where Time loops in some places, Space is locked up. Going back into that means continuing that existence.

... and you know what? Given how bloody easily they breached the Time Lock last time, there's ***nothing stopping them now***.

I've now double-checked the episode. For all of Rassilon's hyperbole, there's **absolutely nothing** that says that going back into there is actually the death of Gallifrey and the Time Lords; the sole exception is *hyperbole*, equating ""life"" with existence outside the Lock and ""death"" with existence inside the Lock.

I reiterate: the Doctor's words were ""back into the Time War, Rassilon; back into hell!"". ***That is not the destruction of Gallifrey***. I don't mean to be rude, but really, **your interpretation is incorrect**.

As a tanget, I would also argue (having just re-watched both these episodes) that Russell T. Davies is a particularly *crap* writer; I'm **glad** he's gone and seeing as Steven Moffat's gone the same way, I'm *equally* glad he's going. I wish Paul Cornell and/or Lawrence Miles could have a crack at fixing all the damage Davies and Moffat have done. The Weeping Angels don't make up for this.

How many times in that story did the ""unbreachable"" Lock get breached? Once to send the signal to the Master. Once to send the White Point Star to Earth. Maybe three times for the Gallifreyan woman to make her way out? Once again if you realise that any prophecy of the future getting into the Lock is a breach. Could've thrown a whole army into a War TARDIS, made it small as a diamond, thrown it to Earth. Bam, instant escape. Miserable, crappy writing I wouldn't insult my nieces with.

*Star Trek* has done it. *TRON Legacy* did it. *Doctor Who* is doing it over and over and over again. Spectacle and overdone drama in the place of good writing.

I remember Moffat also going on a bit with the idea that the Doctor doesn't want to freak out the humans, so he just picks a number that's big enough to convey that he's very old, but not so big it would blow their minds. 

I assume there's something similar at work with the 900-1200 year thing. It's still just numbers he's picking to let Amy and Rory know that he's a lot older than the last time they saw him, but probably even he doesn't know an actual number.

I can (and often have) boil a span of pasta, grate some cheese, add some mushrooms and onions, and some torn strips of cooked meat from the deli counter, season with salt and pepper and serve on a bed of lettuce, and that would cost me about a £1 in ingredients to have enough for a meal that won't have me hungry an hour later, or I can cut this price down to using nasty ass processed packaged meat to about 75 - 80p.

 Alternatively I can slap in some oven chips, with a cheap arse pre processed pack of 4 for a quid frozen whatevers and eat for 50p, although I do mainly live on sandwiches.

 Sure you can go grocery shopping for fresh ingredients for cheaper at many places, but unfortunately I do not live in such a place and can only afford the bus trip to the local supermarket once a week. Thus I cannot really stock up on fresh perishables and so mainly go for frozen things that will last or pre packed crap that will also last.

Exactly how much time was spent between episodes is questionable - see the posts below about how the Doctor just makes up numbers for his age to convey a meaningful amount of time to his human friends - but it was a lot. Maybe years, maybe a century, maybe millennia. 

The reason for this was kept vague for a while, but I think we find it out in ""The Angels Take Manhattan."" The Doctor knew he was coming up on the time when he was going to abandon Rory and Amy the way he always does, because he can't stand to see his companions age and die. But instead of just vanishing like he usually does and finding a new companion, he instead kept stringing his adventures with them out further and further, saving his remaining time with them up, wandering alone for (years? decades?) and then giving himself another trip to see them.

When watching other teams like man city, there are constantly players making runs through the defensive line and the strikers are also moving  side to side along the back line to keep the defense guessing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; When they say introducing John Hurt, was that just a joke since Capaldi is going to be the 12th doctor, or is John Hurt like the 15th doctor or something

Way back in season 5 (new series), the Doctor was considering killing the space whale, and said that afterwards he wouldn't be able to call himself ""The Doctor"", because he would no longer be what that name means.

John Hurt is playing the regeneration that actually did something that invalidated his choice of ""The Doctor"" for his name. i.e. the name ""Doctor"" is ""the promise"" that #11 said was broken by John Hurt's character.

He was in the credits as ""Doctor Who"" and he's playing a regeneration. But not ""really the Doctor"". Basically, the screen actor's guild rules forced that bit of text to be on the screen, because John Hurt is important and needs an ""introducing &lt;actor&gt; as &lt;character&gt;"". Ignore it - it's misleading in the extreme.

If I understand correctly, Capaldi isn't taking over til the Christmas special - which is after the 50th anniversary special.

&gt; I missed all the commotion after this episode and i have no clue what just happened

It was an exciting and dramatic paradox. And is unlikely to be explained in any more detail.

&gt; how the hell did the Doctor see River?

Space Magic.

If you can accept that actual literal time travel is possible ""in dreams"", then you can accept space magic. If not, well, you've picked one of the less important problems.

&gt; WHAT THE HELL IS JOHN HURT!? LIKE WHAT!?

He's Evil Doctor. Or Anti-Doctor. Or something. Some have suggested he might be the [Valeyard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeyard). We don't know for certain, yet.

However, the Valeyard was described as ""an amalgamation of the Doctor's darker sides from between his twelfth and final incarnations"" so the numbers don't quite add up for that theory.",0,1383533906,null,0,false,0,cd67tij,t3_1pu69t,t1_cd67tij,t3_1pu69t,null,1428800272,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
true,troffle,null,null,"1) The current best theory is that John Hurt is playing an older Eighth Doctor (originally Paul McGann, the Fox/BBC co-production movie). The reasoning for this is twofold: a) in one photo he appears to be wearing the 8th Doctor's waistcoat and 9th Doctor's leather jacket; b) if he's participating in the Time War, that would have to be the 8th Doctor's run.

2) Yeah. Pretty much nobody does. And we can speculate all we like, but ultimately you're just waiting until the episode actually comes out.

3) Completely unexplained how ANYBODY's seeing her because the writers are lazy.

Her death happened at the Library planet; and there should be a dump of her brain/personality in the Library's computer.

Your least illogical guess as to how it happened is that the TARDIS is communicating with the Library computer and projecting her (or, who knows, maybe even hosting a copy of her).

The TARDIS is telepathic, meaning that the whole time-travelling / dreaming thing might work (although the earlier claim of ""dreaming is time travelling"" is, to put it politely, screaming bollocks). The TARDIS can project / create solid things too. So, does that mean River's really dead? That depends what you mean by ""dead"". It depends on what you let the TARDIS actually do.

4) Yeah. I think we pretty much covered that in #1, except for what really happened - the BBC decided to pull in a Big Name. Personally? If he really is meant to be the older, aged 8th Doctor?

The resulting fabric tends to look like rows of little v's. It's used a lot for wearables like socks, gloves, and sweaters, but a creative person can make just about anything from it. Cables, where the material crosses over itself in twisty ropes, tend to be knitted. Not always of course.

[Knitting](http://i.imgur.com/vyd9JA3.jpg)

Crocheting is done with one needle with a hook on the end. The tool is usually just called a hook. The work uses one loop at a time going into the row of loops below it. The fabric looks more like rows of small rectangles. It can be a little stiffer than knitting. A lot of stuffed toys (amigurumi) are made from crocheting. Of course just like knitting a creative person can make just about anything. 

[Crochet](http://i.imgur.com/nW5degE.jpg)

I, and I'm guessing most reasonable crafters, don't expect the average person to instantly spot the difference between the two. There are some things that are more commonly made with one or the other, but since they're both versatile it can be hard to tell. I've crocheted gloves and I've seen plenty of people knit stuffed toys and so on. 

That being said, you'll earn a lot of brownie points if you change your conversation leader from ""What are you *knitting*?"" to a simple ""What are you *making*?"" That encompasses any kind of crafting. Now if someone you're close with is knitting or crocheting learn the difference. I love my mom dearly but I swear she calls my crocheting ""knitting"" on purpose to make me insane. If it was knitting there might be stabbing going on, but it's harder to stab with a hook.

If they're back, every time a writer wants to have the entire universe at risk, they have to explain why the Time Lords aren't getting involved, or have a scene where the time lords tell the Doctor to go save everyone, and that would get stupid fast.

We've already talked (arguably *ad nauseam*) about the issue of the Doctor regenerating into a female. This topic has been had and had and had and it always brings arguments rather than true honest discussion.

In the end, some people see who the Doctor's cast as is an important pedestal for social tolerance. I personally feel that there are a few more pressing (and more practical) matters for the show to do in terms of minorities. He's had only *two* companions of a racial minority and both were black and from present-day London. He has not been to *all of Asia.* ***All of it*** since **one** story in 1963 yet we see London *all the time*.

Every companion we've had in Moffat's era (and in almost every other era) have been white, heterosexual, and since 1996 with the sole exception of Donna attracted to the Doctor. Is solving this issue not more pressing or at the very least more sensible than pulling a switcheroo on the Doctor's genitals? 

Some people think that the Doctor just happens to be a male character and there's nothing wrong with someone being who they are. Some people feel the need to change his gender to make some sort of statement.

But this article, just like the report it's responding to, is *yellow journalism*. It's not news, it's not even new.

he's fucking 18! Jesus Christ, give him time and he'll grow, he's already bigger than he was last season, the only reason he hasn't featured more is because the competition this season is more fierce and BR is still experimenting with the formation and our 2 former fullbacks are now acting as wing backs/wingers

Well, you could argue the Fourth Doctor started to ""dip into his own future"", as he put it; the Watcher who triggered his regeneration was supposed to be some kind of avatar of the Fifth Doctor himself.

The Seventh Doctor came to the realisation that he was destined to become Merlin (*Battlefield*). If you read the novelisation, you're informed that said future Doctor/Merlin was also a ginger.

(Which is the only reason I giggle/shiver-pleasantly at all the current references to the Doctor regenerating and wondering if he's ginger. I used to think that was very, very clever presaged writing on the part of old-fan Moffat or the very-careful, given-a-heavy-responsibility Russell Davies. I have since realised how wrong I was about that, given the rest of the muffs those two have made).

The Seventh Doctor, touched on very briefly in *Remembrance Of The Daleks*, was revealed/hinted at being ""more than just a Time Lord"". In the post-TV audio-adventure *Death Comes To Time* (also starring Stephen Fry and guesting Anthony Stewart Head!), he's revealed as a member of a select sub-group of Time Lords called ""gods of the Fourth""; basically a pack of rebels who are also doing good without being too disruptive, but also training others (at least the Doctor's companion Ace) to be a Time Lord in her own right. Complete with new TARDIS.

In the post-TV novels (*Lungbarrow* if I remember right), the Seventh Doctor mentions dreams referring to a game played when younger, ""Eighth Man Bound"" - you hover on the edge of regeneration, trying to get glimpses of your possible future incarnations. Supposedly nobody gets further than their eighth incarnation; supposedly the Doctor had managed his seventh... and then as the Seventh, was worried about reaching his Eighth. As in, terminally worried.

In other novels of the similar era, the seventh Doctor had developed the trend of doing things none of the previous Doctors had done - ""cleaning up"". While the assistant was asleep or away, whenever there was a possibility of some plan going wrong, he'd time-travel back and forth to set props, set the stage, ensure supplies, key technologies or items. He wasn't at all beyond leaving earlier-him a note or two, or otherwise tweaking to give himself the advantage.

If you're familiar with the Eighth Doctor's expanded media, then I assume you're familiar with novels like *Alien Bodies*, *Interference* I and II, *The Taking Of Planet 5*, *The Ancestor Cell*, *etc*. Which would mean you should be at least passingly familiar with (yes, I'll bang on about it again) **Faction Paradox**.

The extended Seventh Doctor novel *Christmas On A Rational Planet* by Lawrence Miles is where the **Grandfather** of the Faction is freed from a ~~Gallifreyan~~ Time Lord prison.

So, credit where it's due. I love all the Doctors (well, to be honest, I was never too impressed by the Eighth; how many times did he lose his memory? And refused to get it back, preferred wandering the Earth without a TARDIS? ***Lost his second heart***, for crap's sake? Refused to find the Time Lords from destroyed Gallifrey living in the back of his mind-and-TARDIS? Silly sod! And admittedly, I hate the hash Davies and Moffat have made of Doctors Ten and Eleven).

No, really, I really haven't.

&gt; Two minutes into The End of Time part 2, one of the Time Ladies states ""he still possesses the Moment and will use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords a like"". This is not part of the prophecy. She is stating it as a fact - the Doctor plans to use the Moment to destroy them.

Yes.

... what *is* this ""Moment"", again?

&gt; They are already time locked at this point.

The Time Lords. This is a species that can make physical stuff out of *mathematics*. Rassilon can throw a bit of his pointy stick at a hologram and *somehow* ***magically*** said bit-of-pointy flies to Earth. **That's a pretty f\*cking sh\*tty ""inescapable"" Time Lock, right there**.

&gt; He is planning to destroy them after he has time locked them. This is consistent with all of 9 and 10's claims of having destroyed the Time Lords.

No, seriously: you're so busy defending your point of view, you're not even listening to the words coming out of your writing.

""He **is planning** to destroy them. ""This is consistent with claims of **having destroyed** them"". That's a tense contradiction already and your first problem.

Second problem: he **hadn't** destroyed them, he was lying every single time he said that.

&gt; No where is it implied that he only time locks them, the only implication is that he time locks them first.

I'm pretty sure you don't understand what an ""implication"" is.

He **flat out said** to Wilf on the bridge of the salvage ship, he *chose* to remember them as wonderful people, destroyed in the War. Then **admits** that they weren't destroyed, they were Timelocked along with the rest of the War *and he did that*.

That's not an implication, that's a **flat out statement** and unlike when he lied, it was **backed up** when we **saw** the Time Lords.

&gt; You're ignoring the most important part of the Time Lord dialogue in order to make your point. It isn't an interpretation - the Doctor has stated many times he destroyed the Time Lords and the Daleks, the Time Lady states he is planning to do so with the Moment, and this is after he has time locked the Time War.

a) I'm ""ignoring"" what you're calling the ""most important part of the Time Lord dialogue"" because it's sh\*ttily written by sh\*tty Russell Davies. And I give you a direct example of that ""Time Lord dialogue"" - Rassilon saying it was the Final Days of the Earth when it *pretty bloody obviously wasn't*.

b) It **is** an interpretation because he was f\*\*king well lying all along and the fact that you **see** the Time Lords proves it!

c) Please, again, tell me what this **Moment** is.

d) And this is what really, truly, ultimately, finally kicks your *interpretative theory* right in the head: **the Doctor has no idea that the Time Lords were involved**, not even when the Ood Circle gives him their warning, not even when the Master invades every human on Earth bar Wilf and Donna. The point at which the Doctor finally realised this **and I strongly encourage you to go back and watch Part 2 right now**, is when the Master broadcasts to the Doctor, listening quietly on the bridge of the salvage ship, that *the falling star was* **the White Point Star Diamond** ***which only comes from Gallifrey***.

e) **You** seem to be ignoring ""important Time Lord dialogue"" - ""back to the Time War, Rassilon, back to hell"". That's not ""destruction"", that's **the Time War**.

From /u/Sjgolf891 
&gt;Star Trek isn't just one show, it's an entire universe that really shows people at their best. By nature, humans want to improve and better themselves. Star Trek is the future that we all want and the future that can be ours if we work towards it. It shows a bright potential for us in which people work together to explore strange new worlds and go where no one has gone before. Star Trek, like many types of science fiction, can also use its extraordinary settings and situations to tell powerful stories that both provide commentary on the world as it is today and offer insight into the human condition. Though Star Trek may seem inaccessible to some who haven't seen it, the show is really about people at its heart. People working together to better themselves and to find out what it means to be human.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; We had been poor with the formation against Newcastle, Swansea and Southampton and our other results were against the bottom two teams.

1. We used 4-2-3-1 against Swansea &amp; Southampton

2. The 3-5-2 against Newcastle was set up differently in midfield to the 3-5-2 against West Brom. Against Newcastle, it was a 3-4-1-2, with Gerrard &amp; Henderson deep and Moses in front; against West Brom, it was a 3-1-4-2, with Lucas deep and Gerrard &amp; Henderson in CM, not holding, roles.

That switch against West Brom was very effective, even if it didn't work against Arsenal (at the Emirates, mind, against 5 midfielders - not a test we're likely to face often).

&gt; The main problems. 1, We haven't kept a clean sheet in our last 8 games with it (despite having spent £25million on four defenders). Whilst conceding the 6th highest shots per game.

&gt; 2, We have failed to score in 3 of those last 8 games, with only one goal from a midfielder in open play. We used to play lovely football, now we rely on Suarez or Sturridge to produce a moment of genius.

We haven't played 8 games with the 3-5-2. In 6 games we've played with it, we've failed to score twice - once against United in the League Cup, once against Arsenal at the Emirates. That's hardly cause for concern, really.

As for the highest shots thing - how many of those are outside the box? Shots from outside the box are always low percentage (obviously you still want to minimise them, but they're nowhere near as concerning as shots in the box). We've done a good job of minimising shots conceded in the box.

&gt; 3, We don't keep the ball enough. 52% average possession. 9th best in the league, with Stoke in 10th.

You know Stoke aren't under Pulis anymore, right? They're not a stick to beat anyone with when it comes to possession. 

But nonetheless, yes, we keep the ball less right now. Given that we're scoring more goals and pick up more points, I'm OK with that. Possession is just a means to an end, and we've worked around the lower possession totals by being better at counterattacking.

Obviously there are some issues, especially the lack of goalscoring from midfield. But I don't think there's anything so concerning as to warrant immediate changes - the 3-5-2 still has lots of merits, most of all because it gets the best out of both Suarez and Sturridge rather than one or the other. Keep in mind we've barely seen the 3-5-2 with both Johnson and Enrique, which would improve it immeasurably.

Seasons 1 and 2 are not as good as the rest of the seasons, which is why you'll hear people saying you should start on 3, but they do have some great episodes. [Top 5 season 1](http://whatculture.com/tv/5-best-star-trek-the-next-generation-season-1-episodes.php) and [one for season 2](http://creativejamie.com/2012/08/30/5-best-episodes-of-star-trek-the-next-generation-season-2/) But if you are going to stick to it, watch the rest of the seasons, or at least start on season 3 and watch all of them.",0,1383547974,null,0,1383548452,0,cd6cj2f,t3_1pu3bl,t1_cd6cj2f,t1_cd6cdhr,null,1428798003,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,sunthunder,num1,,"It's been pointed out already, but in the first half yesterday, Paulinho seemed to be allowed to play much further up the pitch, making us like 4-1-4-1, and we looked good for it until Sandro went off and Paulinho tired.

I know AVB loves his physical midfielders, but I do think we've perhaps lost sight of the fact that a few seasons ago our midfield was anchored effectively by Parker and Modric. They're both defensively apt, but neither of them were outright destroyers. It's not always necessary to have two monsters covering the defense, especially when you've got two leviathans like Sandro and Capoue to choose from.

For some sides (especially at home), I think we should build on what we saw yesterday and play something like:

-----------------------Lloris--------------------

Walker-----Kaboul----------Vertonghen---Rose

---------------------Sandro--------------------

Townsend---Eriksen-------Holtby--------Lennon

--------------------Soldado--------------------

Sandro can cover the defense, give Soldado a couple of through ball machines behind him. Play Paulinho/Dembele in the place of one of Holtby/Eriksen for tougher matches. Play wingers on form, let Lamela have a spot behind Soldado or on the wing, whichever suits him better when he gains confidence.

**Why should I register my work if copyright protection is automatic?**

*Registration is recommended for a number of reasons. Many choose to register their works because they wish to have the facts of their copyright on the public record and have a certificate of registration. Registered works may be eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees in successful litigation. Finally, if registration occurs within 5 years of publication, it is considered prima facie evidence in a court of law. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Copyright Registration” and Circular 38b, Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), on non-U.S. works.*

And they seem to make stupid choices about who to offer supervisor positions to. Like, ya know, the ones who do the least work. Apparently the key to managerial success in retail is not doing anything.

I don't mind the actual job, it's just kind of boring unless it's busy and you can help customers. But the more you help customers, the less time you have to tidy. Then you get told ""just point them in the right direction and tell them we don't have it in stock if it's not there, you don't have time to help them"" by management. Yeah, when you ask ""can you see if you have such and such character out back?"" 90% of staff will fob you off without actually looking. I'll look though. I care about your Christmas.

The strangest thing is, I don't think I've ever been in one of those stores before I worked there that wasn't a disastrous mess. Staff spend most of their time tidying up, yet the place is never tidy. Ever.

I suspect all retail is pretty much like this.

Benefits for permanent staff are okay, I spose. Temps don't get shit. The pay rises annually to a max of £7.75 I think and they get 20% off. But that would just bring the cost of the products down to the same price they are on Amazon, lets be honest. And what few permanent staff they do have barely get enough hours outside of Nov-Dec.

Brick and mortar is dying and it's doing nothing to try and combat it.

Of course, might just be my store. My opinions are my own. Yada yada.",0,1383554414,null,0,1383555030,0,cd6doqg,t3_1pti5o,t1_cd6doqg,t3_1pti5o,null,1428797462,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Clearly the sort of town where patrons of the bakery engage in penis flash dance buffoonery!

Seriously though, it may well be a condition of their late night food licence.  Anywhere selling food after 11pm is going to attract hoards of drunken revellers and all their buffoonery (of the penis flash dance variety and otherwise).  When granting the licence the local council would (or should) have taken into account the likelihood of late-night disturbances and the impact on local residents, businesses, etc.

Secondly it counts modern countries as having been ""occupied"" if they were formerly part of a larger political unit which had been occupied by British troops. Placing troops in Archangel doesn't imply that Britain has invaded every single member state of the former Soviet Union.

A characteristic of the British Empire was that it was done with relatively few troops, for the size of the Empire. Military conquest occurred but a great deal was managed through diplomacy and trade.

I'm no apologist for empire. Really shitty things were done - as long as it is realised that Britain wasn't the worst colonial power. For really shitty behaviour you have to look at the Belgian occupation of the Congo, Germans in SW Africa, and earlier, the Spanish in Central and South America.

2) no, see above, if the police are carrying guns then so will the criminals be, greatly increasing the chance of anyone getting shot, including the police.

3) the police already use batons and tazers, i think the biggest way of protecting the police would be to increase the number of police out on the streets.

4) no more than they do now.

5) this is a stupid question, of course the police would/do get proper training on handling guns, we do have armed response units/fire arms officers in the uk. Do you think they just give them a gun and send them on their merry way without teaching them how to handle a weapon?

The plans are a complete first draft and need to be both reviewed by experts and locals shops and shoppers. While I would like to see it done I am very aware that there could be massive problems with it, so I'm not going to take offence if people don't like it! My responses to some of your points are below. They're a bit curt because I'm at work, but I don't mean to be rude. This is only 'fan art', not official council plans, so nothing to get het up about.

Rat running and increased traffic on local roads needs to be looked at. This is a massive problem with the council, no unity or overarching strategy as far as I can tell. But my plan was based on New York's pedestrianisation of Times Square, which was implemented for a trial using paint, bollards and even garden chairs. If it doesn't work, take it out.

I chose Clifton Triangle because I hate cycling through it and it's really unpleasant to shop on because of the narrow pavements and busy dual carriageway. Maybe there's better areas but I went with what I knew.

[No one pays road tax](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23694438). You pay VED (Vehicle Emissions Duty) on your car, based on the emissions it makes. Some cars pay none. This amount isn't ring-fenced, it goes into the general pot. Even if it was specifically for roads, more gets spent on the roads than VED generates. Everyone pays for the roads, the same way everyone pays for pavements or cycle paths.

The cycle tracks are based on proven Dutch principles so that anyone aged 8 to 80 can use them. The idea that people would cycle if only they were more skilled or confident has been around for decades — it demonstrably hasn't worked.

 I currently live in France and don't miss the NHS one bit. Here the state covers ~70% of costs (with chronic illnesses such as cancer at 100%) and GP visit costs just under 30EUR.

To cover the 30% shortfall most people use an insurance type scheme called a mutual which costs around 30EUR per month. Most mutuals also reimburse alternative therapy, dental care and contact lens/ glasses up to a set amount (for me it's 300EUR a year).   

The difference this makes is massive - next day non emergency GP visits (because the 30EUR charge is enough to put people off going for silly reasons like colds etc), 48hr non emergency consultant visits and when my daughter was born, my partner was allowed to stay in the maternity unit at her discretion for up to 18 days (and the mutuel picked up the charge for the private room, tv, telephone etc).

Hmmm. The idea that the British bucked the trend of decolonisation prevalent amongst its European cousins by freely granting self-government to its then ""subjects"" has largely been debunked. You could start with [this](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n06/bernard-porter/quiet-sinners) review, which is free if you register. 

But, as I said, even if I agreed categorically with what you say, that doesn't really rob me of my point. What you call ""diplomacy and trade"" was often political chicanery. To take, say, the Indian subcontinent / Afghanistan / what is now Pakistan as an example, death tolls that are attributable to English / British involvement but are not carried out directly by British troops are, I would argue, still morally laid at our door. 

Still, even if that weren't the case, we are a nation that has been more or less continuously at war since the 11th century. We've warred 13 times with France alone. My argument doesn't rely on a strict interpretation of where we've invaded and how many troops we stationed there (or not).

Lets face it, a filling is a piece of piss. Once you've anaesthetised a mouth and prepared the filling material, doing 2 or 3 fillings instead of one makes a negligible difference to the time taken.

No, it would just escalate the use of guns

 No, except in the specific circumstances of them knowing they were facing an armed assailant, in which case an armed response unit would attend. If all police carried guns as a matter of course, then they would be at more risk, due to the escalation of offenders thinking they needed to carry guns.


&gt;What other way of protection could the police use instead of guns?

stab vests, tasers,

They *may*, but it's not really something I factor in as a major reason for not wanting them to have them.

Paying $220 for both of you in health insurance per month means you're practically getting the president to wipe your ass. Couples insurance can start at $10 a week which covers most basics not under the medicare system.

Seeing a specialist that costs you something is always optional, the public healthcare system offers it for free in almost all areas. And if you're seeing a private (not public) GP at $75 per visit, which is a slightly higher rate anyway outside of WA, you still get your rebate of $36.85 from the government, plus the additional rebate from your private insurance, which is usually about 30-40%. Bulk billing, ie FREE GP VISITS, exists all round Australia also. I can google it if you want. 
Anyway, almost any GP or medical centre will do the rebate on the spot, without you needing to go to Medicare. My personal doctor is 45$ a visit and they amount the $36 into my account immediately on the spot.

Again, private health insurance gives you big rebates (I presume if you're paying $220 a month for insurance you'll get it all back).

Wilfred: But you said your people were dead. Past tense.

The Doctor: Inside the Time War. And the whole war was time-locked. Like sealed inside a bubble. It's not a bubble, but just think of a bubble. Nothing can get in or out of the time lock. Don't you see? Nothing can get in or out except something that was already there.

He didn't say they weren't dead. He confirmed that they are in fact dead in the Time War, which is inside the time lock. This is not him saying they aren't dead or that he lied. If he hadn't time locked them first, someone one could have come in and saved them from their death. If this is the dialogue you're interpreting to mean he lied, you're really taking a jump.

Seeing the Time Lords does not mean he lied about destroying them, they're the Time Lords right before being destroyed. They're time travelers, that's why he tried to time lock them. He didn't want anyone and anything to be able to stop them from dying in the Time Lord's future. 

His quote ""back into hell"" is in reference to his earlier quote:

The Master: But this is fantastic, isn't it? The Time Lords restored.

The Doctor: You weren't there. In the final days of the war. You never saw what was born. But if the time lock's broken then everything is coming through. Not just the Daleks, but the Star of Degradations. The Horde of Travesties. The Nightmare Child. The Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres. The war turned into hell! And that's what you’ve opened. Right above the Earth. Hell is descending.

The Doctor is saying that why he locked in the time lock is Hell, and that if the Time Lords escape, all of Hell does too. By sending them back into the time lock, they're back with the Hell he was afraid would leak through. It doesn't mean they aren't going to die, he's just making a reference to the fact that he's held Hell back in the time lock and that they'll have to return to it. They're all time travelers - even if he destroyed them all in the end, there are uncountable years prior to their destruction where they still existed and could travel out of the time lock. This was the point in the time lock. Killing them at any given time is useless as long as they can time travel or people can time travel to them. The time lock seals them in an prevents them from escaping their eventual death.

You've entirely fabricated ""the Doctor admitted he lied"" in your own head. The only thing he lied about was how he presented the Time Lords to others, ""how he chose to remember them"". He never says he lied about destroying them.",0,1383567664,null,0,false,0,cd6ff5n,t3_1prtvc,t1_cd6ff5n,t1_cd6a4tn,null,1428796653,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

1) The inevitable criticism the players and manager will take over the next few days will hopefully give them the rocket up their arse that they need. A point needs to be proved against Kuban and Stoke.

2) We can see (albeit briefly) how the Poz-Bony combo can work, and try to begin to overcome our reliance on Michu.

3) Bony now simply HAS to play due to Michu's absence (unless Laudrup picks Vasquez, at which point I'd simply laugh at the farcical incredulity of it all).

3) JdG has again been shown up to be the lazy player he is - when we play well, he plays well, but in big or tough games, he goes missing, and he will more often than not duck out of 50-50 tackles. Hopefully whichever manager coming in after Laudrup will now that he is not worth the £5 million+ we'd have to spunk on him to bring him in permanently.

4) Cardiff can (hopefully) expect a colossal backlash and raucous home support when they play us down here.

5) Laudrup's limitations, both tactically and with regards to man-management have been exposed time and time again (particularly last night - a shit hoofball team there for the taking, and he plays defensively without a striker - ludicrous), and although I will be forever grateful to him for delivering our first ever major trophy, I am also glad this is his final season with us.

6) Tremmel can now start in goal, as his form when called upon has largely deserved. He also offers stronger set-piece defence than Vorm.

Unfortunately due to 'austerity' lazy cps, bungs to gov't , crap magistrates and doe eyed offenders in suits , it is seen as a panacea to stop reoffending etc.
 In reality it is a easy cash cow for the likes of serco and g4s, who do nothing more than report any breaches and sit  back whilst the justice system then wastes more time and effort to rearrest,prosecute the offender- only to see them back on a tag a few days later.
   It is used for he wrong people, if you like a chaotic life style- it will not work. If you are a recidivist offender- it will not work, if your are a yoof with pricks for parents (who are the ones who should be tagged) it will not work.
    I once spent a whole afternoon listening to a sales rep for G4S trying to sell me the benefits of tagging and how it had 'assisted' police in arresting a person for an assault which left a man in a coma...... if that person had been in jail and not on tag- there would have been one less victim, one less crime and one less waste of money time and effort.

Regards private health care -- most people cannot afford it because the forced contribution to the NHS takes away the money they could otherwise use to buy themselves proper health care and choose a provider who actually has to provide quality (or go out of business) instead of being able to carry on in their miserable way since the patients have no rights (I mean real rights, not prettily worded patients charters) because currently the NHS service is viewed as an alm that gets handed out for 'free' and that allows staff to kill people with impunity without even one guilty person going to jail.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"What's happening in January? Oh, right. Temporary transitional controls will end, allowing nationals of two more countries with a combined population of 29 million to have free movement in the UK.

Depending on what you hear and who you hear it from, anywhere from a few thousand ([Migration Advisory Committee](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/workingwithus/mac/-restrictions-worker1/transitional-restrictions.pdf?view=Binary)) to 50 thousand a year over five years (MigrationWatch) will come from Romania and Bulgaria to live in the UK.

They will also be free to live in several other countries which also imposed transitional controls seven years ago (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands and Austria) so there's no reason to assume they'll come only to the UK. They can already move freely to other EU countries which did not impose controls. I don't think you will ever see that mentioned in any UK tabloid.

But when other East and Central European countries joined the EU in 2004 (the A8 countries) the UK, Republic of Ireland and Sweden did not impose transitional controls to limit the inward migration.  
After eight years, a million people had come to the UK from those countries, from a combined population of about 73 million.  
So that's about 1.3% of the A8 population over 8 years: about 0.17% of the A8 population coming to the UK every year when no transitional controls were in place.

0.17% of the combined Romania/Bulgaria population is about 50,000, which I think is where MigrationWatch gets its estimate from.

It's worth noting though that:

* A million immigrants from the A8 from 2004-2012 did not sink the UK. It changed, there are lot more polskie sklepy about, but it was the global financial crisis that screwed us, not an influx of builders and spicy sausage.
* Without _any immigration at all_, the population is expected to increase by about 150,000 a year for the next few years. That's just natural increase. So the government would still have to find room, housing, education, health services, employment for another 750,000 or so in five years even without any further migration.

Coping with population change is part of any responsible government's job. I honestly don't think another quarter of a million is going to destroy the country, and I don't think the figure will be that high.

The UK Government has already run a negative marketing campaign telling people not to come to the UK because it's wet and cold and rubbish. And most of the Romanians and Bulgarians have responded ""Fine. We wouldn't want to anyway.""

If thousands come here, it's because they think the UK is a better prospect than any other country. Better than France or Spain or Malta even though their languages are closer to Romanian and the weather's nicer than the UK. Better than Germany or Austria or Italy which are closer and have better skiing.

If they think the UK's that good, then I'm staying.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I do not think which it is matters in terms of explaining why there have not been prosecutions

Ah yes, the old 'less is more' approach to ascertaining a situation.

The police ignore all kinds of crimes for a variety of reasons. Especially when it comes to racially/culturally sensitive issues. Prosecuting people for one form of mutilation while another remains completely legal would clearly be a source of tension.

And while some people will say that MGM happens 'for a good reason' or that it's 'harmless,' well, the people who practice FGM say the same things. In truth, the harmful effects (loss of sensation, sexual problems, psychological trauma, even risk of death) are quite comparable. The only difference between the two is that the term FGM covers a range of practices, whereas MGM usually doesn't. Hence, why it's important to understand exactly what is happening.

This is before you even consider how impractical it would be to prosecute community-leaders, parents and religious figures for carrying out a traditional practice that is seen as perfectly normal by their community. Prosecuting people for this practice could easily make matters far worse (for the girls, as well as the community at large).

It might just be 'the law is the law' to you but the police, and courts, have to be pragmatic. Would enforcing it be practical? How much harm is actually being done (what forms of FGM are occurring), and what can they actually do about it?

Blindly enforcing the law is not always the right approach. It can easily cause *more* harm in sensitive situations like this. So I think it is fair to ask for more information.",0,1383573085,null,0,false,0,cd6gibs,t3_1pumtu,t1_cd6gibs,t1_cd6fixw,null,1428796145,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

From the mental health perspective, they're second to none. My appointments - which are roughly every three weeks, are scheduled at the end of the current appointment, so I know in advance the exact date and time. Any changes to medication is discussed in depth - my appointments can easily last 90 minutes - and I'm always comfortable that, should I go a bit ""wobbly"" I can contact the surgery and the admin staff will do their absolute best to fit me in to see a GP, even if it's just the locum.

The other side to that, is accessing a regular GP, for other services. Until a few years ago, you could generally get an appointment with a GP within a couple of days - for example, if I phoned now, I could get an appointment by Thursday / Friday at the latest.

Then the surgery changed to the appointments system outlined in the article. It's now almost impossible for anyone not receiving regular ongoing treatment, to get an appointment in advance. If I wanted to see a ""Regular"" GP on Thursday? I'd need to start phoning at 8AM that morning, and hope to get an appointment. That's great if you're in a position where that's feasible - for the vast majority of people who work 9am - 5pm, phoning at 8AM to book an appointment realistically means you're all fighting for the 5:30 / 5:45 / 6:00 slots.

Now that the banks have got more collateral, they're starting to lend more and our ridiculously low base rate of interest makes it easier for people to borrow.

Gross Income: [£26,500](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/pay-salaries-survey-ashe-ons) (the median full time salary).

Tax Bill: £3412 income tax and £2249.40 national insurance. Total: [£5661.40](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php)

Central Government Health Service spend: [£123.5bn](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_health_care_spending_10.html). Total spend £549.9bn.
% Health service Spend: ~22.459%

0.22459*5661.4 =~£1271.47 of the average full time workers tax bill would go to NHS funding.
Of course in reality the average tax bill would not reduce by this amount, not least due to changes in spending requirements necessitated by the lack of public healthcare as well as other opportunities for government spending.

true,Geek_nurse,null,null,"It's interesting to hear your comments on my opinions. While I apprechiate your polite natured post, this issue rather infuriates me. My reply shall no doubt demonstrate that.
I do feel that it is quite condescending to clarify the ""road tax"" vs. ''VED'' duty, but if it made you feel better well done. 

I am aware of the Bristol Cycling Campaign that this year has hoped to gain 109million pounds of funding to implement cycle lanes in the city and do not begrudge it. Would your plan be funded from that money? I seriously doubt you could just put up a bunch of bollards and block the area for free. 
I feel like these initiatives are often more hassle than they are worth and always over budget. There are far greater issues in the City that could be addressed with that kind of money. I find it irrational to spend money on aesthetic choices in this economy. That is only my personal opinion. 

I feel like your proposal if successful would only punish people in my situation who generally commute through the triangle. I have worked at the BRI and hope to do so again and do not live in the city because I cannot afford to. We can argue about life choices till we are blue in the face but the bottom line is not everyone has the luxury of being able to have the things they want. I have to drive to work, If I take another route it adds time to my journey and wastes petrol. I actually drove through the triangle this morning at 9am and experienced no issues. Lucky me perhaps, but it is a rare occasion that I have trouble there. 

I observe that in Time Square making the area more pedestrian friendly was favoured because it is a high tourist traffic area. The triangle is not, most of the people I see there are students. Other than the free museum the Triangle has little other than shopping in the area which serves the student population. There are already two large pedestrian focused shopping area in Bristol how many are really needed? 

Do you also suggest to  pedestrianise Clifton Village? It is often quite heavy with traffic there too and enjoys some quite lovely shops?  

Perhaps you find it annoying that people have to drive around that area, but rest assured paving it over for pedestrians would just move the problems to a different area.

Have you conducted a survey to ascertain if the general pedestrian traffic of Clifton feels the same way as you? From you ""here is why I did it"" it seems like you are focused more on the issues of cyclists rather than pedestrians. 

Rather harshly I find that your plan is no better than drawing a lovely picture on a napkin then asking for validation online. 
If you want to change the triangle for yourself or your perceived needs perhaps understand that in this modern society there is never a quick fix easy solution. Why not take the time to assess the needs of the community as a whole and conduct a survey and  ask the people who use it first other than just your personal opinion. Then you would be able to see if your plan was viable.

PS: I have no desire to air any further opinions on this issue, reply only to suit your audience or yourself. I only hope that you do not succeed in your endeavours in this matter.

Basically leave on a high and let the opposition enter on a low?

I took their soonest appointment, and now have one in a week and a half's time. Evening or weekend appointments, so I don't need to miss work, were weeks away.

I have since tried to sign up for two other GP surgeries in my area, both of which have similar wait times for appointments, and to which I can only sign up during three two-hour periods each week. I tried with both to leave my documentation with them and phone up during these hours as I had to work at these times, but of course they could not do that.

When I finally get to turn up to my appointment, I will be allowed ten minutes, during which I am only allowed to ask about one problem. I tried to book two appointments as I have two issues to discuss, but this was not allowed. Should I need a prescription I will need to take the paperwork from the doctor to the receptionist myself, turn up again at the receptionist *another day*, and then co-ordinate with a pharmacist accordingly. In other countries the GP can just order it for you from his computer.

I know it's a shock, but look up published combined ratios for insurance firms. The combined ratio is the amount they pay out in claims vs the amount they take in by premiums.

Admiral Group have a combined ratio of 84% (2012), which means 84% of all the money they take in for premiums is being paid out for claims. That leaves 16% to account for all other costs; staffing, property, etc. I would wager that they actually make very little money from premiums alone.

Admiral group are also one of the best performing; in their 2012 results they list the market combined ratio as 105% (2011), which means that as a whole, the insurance industry is paying out more than it is taking in. A graph shows it has been at very least 100% since 1995. Yes, the car insurance industry has not made a profit on raw premiums since 1995. 

They make their money by investing the premiums, of course, but fundamentally they are not ripping you off.

Your quotes will be high due to location, I paid £350 at 21 on a Mazda MX5 with a similar history to you. Rant and rave all you like, but insurance companies rely on statistics, and this is what they show. If you can come up with a better way of assessing the risk of an individual, be my guest; there simply is not one.

If you wish to blame someone, blame car hire firms jacking up their prices for insurance clients. Blame ambulance chasers who take every little knock to be a whiplash claim worth thousands.

 If you are not in a full time job that also raises your premium because you can potentially use your car more than someone that is at work all day and are there fore a greater risk.

Unfortunately, like yesterday Spurs' movement when players do get around the edge of the box is terrible. Several times they just stood there doing nothing, it's ridiculous.

Jan played very well yesterday, but relying on LB/RBs for width against properly good counter attacking teams might not go so well, so trying other things against teams that are more beatable will be the safer option.

By doing so, this stimulates demand, which drives growth. It's the same as cutting taxes increases people's money.

However, when you have a stimulus package, whatever it is will only remain stimulated for as long as the package is there. The government could have made the scheme indefinite e.g. like the 'right to buy' scheme for council houses. Instead they have said three years, partly because it's really not good for the government to be loading itself up with all these guarantees of private debt, and partly because three years will land whichever government (11/8 odds Labour, 1/3 odds Conservative) with the inevitable contraction.

Nearly all UK healthcare is provided by the government so it would be stupid if we were comparing the cost of healthcare to something that didn't include government spending. 

GDP is a measure of expenditure so debt is irrelevant. The source of money does not affect what it is spent on. 

You keep posting that definition, have you read it? It does not say that equal cost is fair. If you burden the poorest people with the same cost as the rich, that's making things *less* fair. 

The same costs will have much much greater effects on those at the bottom of the income ladder, burdening them to a much greater extent. That is not fair – burdening the poor is favouring the rich. 

That source only suggests that the welfare and tax systems *in the US* are not functioning correctly.

Although this may sound like a good idea, Eriksen is not the best in defense. IF you were going to do this, you would leave Eriksen in the 10 hole, play Sandro deep as an Anchor man, and have holtby alongside him, because Holtby has a much higher defensive workrate than Christian.
&gt; Also it is ridiculous how little service soldado gets and i cant see why avb plays lennon on the left it just cloggs up the middle of the pitch playing inverted wingers and reduces the crosses to soldado in which he can score.

I agree with you here that Soldado does not get enough service. Lennon should not be playing on the left side but with Townsend playing in incredible form right now, there's nowhere for Lennon. I do like siggy on the left because he can get a cross in when we need it. Other than that, I agree with AVB, I've never been a fan of crossing the ball unless its a low cross.

I'm having to go through a lot of treatment at the minute, including specialist dental care. My dentist is doing all she can for my teeth and we've spoken about how frustrating the system is for her. I can't say I envy her. 

Anyway, long story short: If your in desperate need of dental work and you don't live miles away from Manchester, you'll be able to find a dentist with relative ease. ",0,1383582944,null,0,false,0,cd6jqsv,t3_1pv469,t1_cd6jqsv,t1_cd6j88o,null,1428794578,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Yet you still don't see a Chelsea crest next to my name. That is because I do think I am a plastic fan, not the real thing. I'm only in it for the fact that I happen to like this club.

I think we can be the bigger man sort-of-speak here, speaking of course in reddit-terms, and just avoid invading our rival's subs.

No. My whole argument is that he punched her through a window and that is closer to assault than it is to self-defence. Again, not complicated or gendered.

She should not have done that. It is assault. He should not have smashed her head through a window. That is not self defence. People on this site are relishing it precisely because it is an act of revenge. You can forgive the guy for it, because he was probably wasted / heat of the moment. The commenters mentally masturbating over it on are disgusting though.

&gt;Forget size and all that shit, she instigated it. He didn't even punch her. On top of that, it was her back and thus weight that went through the window, not her head. Please try and forget gender in this instance and see it for what it is.

You are the one hung up on gender here. In fact, it was reddits response that brought gender into it. In the situation itself, gender has almost no role. If the aggressor was another man, it is still not OK to smash their head through a window.

Still, I stand by what I said: any businesses that rely on paying people less than the living wage need to change. If they truly can’t afford to pay their staff a living wage, then yes they will need to raise prices. I don’t believe that most companies are in this position though, most companies will pay low wages because they can get away with it, not because they sell at such low prices with such small profit margins that they have no choice. Labour costs will only make up a fraction percentage of providing a good/service anyway, and the other costs would be unaffected. So prices would rise by less than wages, and the raising of the minimum wage would still be a net positive for low earners. 

There are other benefits to raising the minimum wage: reduced welfare costs/ less welfare dependency/“making work pay”, other costs related to poverty will be reduced, we will have a stronger consumer economy, and a more equal society. The list of positives outweighs the one negative people always point to, raising prices, which is overstated and is offset by raising wages anyway.

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"After her death in *Forest of the Dead*, the Tenth Doctor saved River's mental pattern to the Library data core, as an alternative to letting her die completely. This was a bit of a selfish act, as no one thought to ask River her opinion on being shunted into a technological afterlife-- but fortunately she seemed pretty cool with the idea, at least as of the end of that episode.

As a mental imprint, River is able to enter Madame Vastra's conference call in *Name of the Doctor*, though the method utilized is left vague. While there, she mentally links herself with Clara, allowing her to appear as a spectral image in the real world later in the episode.

What is left up to the viewer to decide is how the Doctor was able to physically interact with her, and whether she was previously able to appear to him (perhaps via a mental link either directly to him, or to the TARDIS). He says:

&gt;""You are always here, to me. And I always listen... and I can always see you.""

Likewise, it's left up to the viewer (and of course, to Moffat) whether her final lines:

&gt;RIVER:
I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, then how can I still be here?

&gt;DOCTOR:
OK. How?

&gt;RIVER:
Spoilers. Goodbye, sweetie. (fades away)

That doesn't make any sense. Say the country spends 10% of GDP on healthcare. If you spend 10% more on healthcare, that 10% of GDP would increase to about 11%, regardless of if it is the government or any other organisation spending the money.

Let's just dismiss this argument about ""fair"" as an unwinnable one. You are are arguing that making the poor pay the same number of pounds as the rich is fair.

Setting a timer so that your boiler only comes on at certain times, perhaps before you normally get out of bed, before you get home in the evening, or whatever.

It's absolutely no worse than the vast majority of costumes that get posted to this sub, and clearly recognizable as a 10 cosplay, even if it doesn't get literally every detail perfect.

As for ""The women you know"", Nigri doesn't ruin anything for anyone.  She's a model.  She's comfortable with her body and with wearing the costumes that *other people designed* to essentially appeal to men.  If your friends don't want to follow the costumes exactly and show off as much skin as her, that's fine.  They don't have to.  They can wear whatever they want, and no one will give a shit, just like she can follow the costumes exactly, and no one will give a shit (except the people complaining she doesn't know anything about whatever she's cosplaying, or that she's being a whore, or that, well, you get the idea).

Unless, of course, you buy into the idiocy all over this thread, which is that hot girls have to wear absolutely perfect cosplay all the time, or they're fakes who just do it to appeal to men, and don't know anything about what they're cosplaying.

However, it means little what you call it. The fact is that cultures a malleable and plastic. You are arguing for a fixed conception of culture based around your own perception ( confirmation bias). These two things contradict each other. 

Either you're right and culture is fixed, or you're wrong and it isn't. If it's not fixed then you original comment about ""our"" culture and ""their"" culture us meaningless. 

What you could argue is that there is a set of accepted cultural norms, those have come about through negotiation of different groups within society.

Integration , therefore, has to be a series of negotiation between people to come to an accepted set of ideas. Now when it comes to things like FGM what you need is cultural engagement and negotiation to eradicate it.. You can have hard incentives and soft ones but you have to remember it's about giving and taking.

true,Jaqacake,null,null,"I occasionally recruit for unskilled minimum wage jobs so a different area but here's some of the things that stop me from contacting candidates.

If I saw your application I almost certainly wouldn't invite you for interview - why? Foreign phone number - I can't easily call you and that's how I invite people to interview (it's also quite common for foreign numbers to be blocked on company phone systems), I need to be able to explain the call to my bosses when it shows up on the phone bill or email you instead and ask you to call me but I'm not going to bother unless you are outstanding compared to the other 100 CVs I've read today. Don't make it hard for me to contact you.

The rest of this essay is very general, not specific to you at all, it's just stuff I need to get out my system.

Rejection replies: If you apply through the job centre site I can't easily reply so I don't.  If you email me directly I almost always will, the exception is if you just send a blank email with a CV attached and nothing else, then I probably won't read your CV (some people don't even put a title).  If I've got a lot of applicants (I will get 100-150 a day advertising on the job site) it's hard to give a reply to everyone, I always try to if they've emailed but some probably get missed.  I'm less likely to put the effort in if you haven't (eg, covering letter for a different position), or there is any suspicion you are only applying for the job to meet benefit requirements.

Common mistakes people make (which generally means rejection):

* Covering letter or CV tailored to a completely different position
* Spelling and grammatical errors
* Inconsistencies leading me to suspect you've copy pasted half the content from somewhere else or are lying
* Unexplained career breaks (I prefer someone to say they couldn't find a job for 2 years than leave it blank, although that still looks pretty bad, it might be personal preference)
* Shitty excuses for leaving a job.  CV isn't the place for them, you don't need to tell me why at this stage you left (although it might be relevant) but (an example from last week) saying you quit your apprenticeship because your mum wouldn't give you lifts any more (and basically you couldn't be arsed to cycle 6 miles or get the bus is the inference I am going to make) just makes me think you're a whiny git full of pathetic excuses

General advice

* If you have a lot of short term positions because they were temp then say that, otherwise do you want me to assume you just always get sacked after 2 or 3 months
* if you can't find work then do something - temping, or voluntary work while job searching looks a million times better than a lot of time doing nothing - even if you really are spending all day applying for jobs an employer can't see that, if you just volunteer a day a week in a charity shop it shows you want to work and helps break the stereotype the daily mail puts out about the unemployed, the longer you're out of work the harder it is to convince someone you're not unemployed because you're useless
* Young people - please talk on the phone instead of communicating in grunts.  Also 'whatever' is not the correct response to me asking if you'd like to come in for an interview.  I have no idea how you'd ever get a job if you weren't cheaper than people who can speak.

A key thing to remember and I now realise how true this is having done it.

There are a lot of different types and some are really, really insidious and often mirror symptoms that are not due to abuse. When you make a law like this it blanket covers them all. 

 What a lot of people on this thread are correctly arguing is that a lot more false allegations will crop up due to this, and a false allegation can easily ruin a family. I know this because it's happened in my family, both  unreported cases as well as false allegations. (I have a really fucked up family history) 

Making it legally mandatory for everybody involved is not the answer, but increased training and a clear referral system is, not to mention that more specialised social workers would be a lot more beneficial than having to have people who are not specially trained being in charge of such decisions. 

In the NHS for example, if you have suspicions concerning abuse you report immediately to your line manager, who themselves will go higher unless they themselves are specialists in the matter. The fact that the trust itself and therefore your job could be in trouble is sufficient impetus without having to legislate further.

The real issue here is that the govt doesn't want to spend more money on necessary services and are thus trying to shift the responsibility downwards.

true,NotBaldwin,somerset,West Country,"While I agree with your notion of needing to identify the different types of FGM being practiced here, I disagree with the notion of it not being harmful. Circumcision is generally considered not harmful mostly because its incredibly common in the US and also it can solve a fair few medical issues relating to foreskin retraction; however there is a growing countermovement to involuntary circumcision of children. 

FGM doesn't have any reported benefits, but it does have a scale of harmful effects depending on how severe the mutilation is. No matter how you look at it, this is the sexual mutilation of a young girl for purely cultural reasons. It is done only because 'it has always been done'.

Now while I do understand that punishing every case of FGM equally would not be beneficial, I do not think that a 'pragmatic' policing of this would help either. For this to be stopped, a bold policy of aggressively tackling the problem with prosecution would be extremely beneficial. Retroactively punishing those that caused their, or other's, daughters to undergo FGM would not in my opinion  be beneficial as then it would simply become a witch hunt that would be highly damaging to these cultural communities.

A supportive programme of community outreach, education and medical advice in areas where there are high density populations of FGM practicing cultures needs to happen. If families are found to have practiced this then compulsory attendence to such programmes would be a good place to start, as well as possibly community service or reparation from significant offenders.

However, I feel a Government initiative which posited that any new cases of FGM after a certain date would recieve extremely harsh sentencing, possibly through a remodelling of the law taking into account different categories of FGM, would yield a firm statement that would allow this problem to be policed effectively.

**edit

I actually suffered from a Phimosis, meaning I couldn't retract my foreskin. Thankfully I avoided circumcision as I was able to slowly stretch my foreskin over a period of several weeks as a teenager and solve the issue. I was terrified of getting circumcised, as the procedure sounded extremely painful and unpleasant. I will admit stretching wasn't a fun process, and I am in two minds as to whether being circumcised as an infant would've been easier for me, as I wouldn't really remember it. I did go through my early teen years thinking I was wrong and it really affected my confidence when I began to have relationships. So while I am against involuntary Male circumcision, I can see the argument for involuntary medically motivated circumcision.

Did it ever occur to you that she's just working with what she's given?  Obviously she's attractive.  Obviously she's comfortable with her body and exhibiting it, both as a professional model and as an amateur cosplayer.

I think you have your cause and effect totally fubar'd.  Cosplayers don't design the costumes they're cosplaying.  In fact, it's antithetical to the entire notion of cosplay to do so.  She is attractive and is comfortable wearing the insanely sexualized nonsense comic book artists/movie costumers/game designers like to stick female characters in which, again, she had no part in creating or designing.

You're setting up a Catch 22.  If a woman is attractive and comfortable wearing the costumes someone else designed, she's a fake who puts pressure on other people to achieve unrealistic standards of beauty which makes cosplay ""not fun"" anymore.  If a woman isn't attractive and/or comfortable wearing exactly the costumes depicted in media, she's also a fake who doesn't know what she's trying to cosplay and can't pull it off, so she shouldn't try.

Let me make this crystal clear.  The problem here **isn't the cosplayers**.  The problem is the people projecting their (largely unwanted) opinions on the cosplayers, especially when those opinions have much less to do with the quality of the cosplay and much more to do with 1) invented ideas about the cosplayers ""true fanhood"" of the IP they're cosplaying and 2) how attractive they are.  Stop focusing on those two irrelevant and pointless issues and this all goes away.  Focus on, exactly as you said, having fun, and recognize that the problems with cosplay are *much more* to do with what we project on them rather than anything they're bringing to the table themselves.",0,1383587323,null,0,false,0,cd6liy9,t3_1pu0dk,t1_cd6liy9,t1_cd67d0p,null,1428793745,-4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-4

You're right in that insurance is fills the same basic function as government funding, but since it's private somebody is taking money out of the pot and putting it in their pocket.

Among other things it includes:

1. new without notice court orders (clauses 1-20) banning anyone from doing something, or requiring that they do it, if that person is a risk of carrying out anti-social behaviour, with powers of arrest.

2. a dispersion power (clauses 32-39), by which a constable can order that any person (in a designated area) leave an area if the constable believes that person might carry out anti-social behaviour or be involved in crime or disorder, and the officer can seize any item likely to be involved in anti-social behaviour. If you don't comply, you can go to prison for up to 3 months.

3. then there are community protection notices (clauses 40-54), by which a police officer or local authority officer can order anyone to do anything or not to do anything so as to prevent or reduce their detrimental effect on the quality of life of those nearby. This comes with a power of entry to private property, impose a fine (via a fixed penalty notice or otherwise) and broad powers of seizure and forfeiture.

4. New ""public space protection orders"" (clauses 55-68), letting local authorities do pretty much the same as 3 but in public spaces, and more about ""not doing things in an area"" rather than a person not doing stuff. These can last for up to 3 years.

5. Closure notices (clauses 69-75); letting a police inspector or local authority close any premises (stopping anyone other than the owner or people who live there from accessing it) for up to 48 hours (or 72 over Christmas) if they think there might be a nuisance or disorder nearby. With a fine for non-compliance.

6. New powers to evict people (clauses 86-92) if they or anyone in the property, have committed a crime, have fallen afoul of 1 or 5 above or a few other things.

There there is other stuff about firearms, dangerous dogs, police colleges, extradition, compensation for miscarriages of justice (mostly removing it) and so on.

It would be a sizeable development, certainly, not much larger than a number of other developments going on right now in London.

Anything more and it will be seen as a perk rather than a business cost, and taxed.

The only question I can answer. It is only the Doctor and River and als the Master who can drive the TARDIS.

River was conceived in the TARDIS and is also known as the child of the TARDIS and she learned in 'Let's kill Hitler' how to drive it because Amy and Rory were stuck in the Teselecta space ship and she had to get them out. She was taught by the TARDIS itself.

If anything River can drive the RARDIS better than the doctor. In the 'Time of Angels' she was able to land the TARDIS without it making the *sshhhhhh shhhhhh shhhhhh* sound. When the Doctor asked her why it did not make the *sshhhhhh shhhhhh shhhhhh* sound, she said that he always leaves the brakes on.

To look at our comments you would have to come to this sub. Why bother? Even if you come and they offend you then why bother coming if you get offended?

If you won a match against City and went to their sub all you'd read would be ""We were the better team"" or ""at least we don't have shit support like them"", or ""the ref robbed us"". Even if they deserved to lose you would still find something that will infuriate you which they said about your club. 

This kind of thing on other subs remains on other subs but as soon as it is about Arsenal even if it is on another team's sub it bothers them and then they link to it sometimes from 2 or 3 different subs and cant get over it for weeks, brigading and openly showing just how stupid their fan base is. They don't even have any good retorts if you call them out or start an argument, it is just circlejerking each other saying stuff kids on Xbox live say.

The discussion on /r/Gunners is so bad that I could create a new profile today and fit in as one of your top posters because I feel I know more about your club watching it weekly than so many of your fans who know near to nothing and don't even get me started on your new queue which genuinely got me worried why it was so different from every other club. I made the mistake of noticing these things after being linked to my profile from your sub regularly for the last week while 0 links were deleted. 

It honestly makes me laugh and I enjoy reading all this blow up. Like I said in my post that there are a lot of you sensible ones out there, I mean I live with Arsenal locals who are pretty normal and nothing different from me but just the sheer amount of these new idiots you are acquiring is staggering. I wont pretend and say I don't enjoy watching them grow in numbers because its a problem for you guys as your stadium would still empty if you were leading the league with 5 points but down 3-1 to United in the next match come the 90th minute. This is the kind of culture which is moving into your club because of these guys and its not just a different online presence, it is a part of it.
