You need to get experience fast.

What do you want to do? Big Data, Design, SEO, Advertising, Research, PR... etc? What do you have a feeling for?

Then, don't wait for it to be offered to you - just do it off your own back, so when you're asked ""What's your experience?"" you can point to things.

Otherwise, you'll just be another foreigner in town looking for work.

AND LONDON EATS PEOPLE, especially young ones with no experience of life and no prospects and no friends and no money and no place to live and no contacts and no clue to how it works and, very importantly, nothing anyone can benefit from apart from an ass.

Like any major city, this place is awash with homeless young people who came here with what little they had and within weeks, maybe months, wound up fucked. The first girl I really, really fancied at University dropped out, moved to London, hung herself after 6 months.

I just want to put this negative into your head. London can be great, but it's a fucking big city, and as Ovid said, Magna civitas, magna solitudo (big city, big loneliness). Don't come here without a very clear plan, without something that sets you apart, with no contacts and a few friendly faces. And especially, don't come here with nothing that differentiates you from the half a million a year young people that think they can arrive, buy into the whole ""London""^^TM brand without actually taking it as a very sober decision.

Get a track record, get some experience before you come here. Have something you can trade with, that people will want. Unless you're coming here from Stanford with a top score in engineering or something, you need to be able to offer something that other people don't have. The streets are not paved with gold, Dick Whittington.

Like I said, competition is fierce and I spend all day turning people down for jobs. Odd as it might sound, that's what I do for a living, which is why I said what you've (maybe) read above.

That aside, crack on. Just get on with being awesome and don't expect London to make you awesome - you have to do that by yourself.

true,DrRandle,null,null,"Your perception of the Angels and River Song are unfounded. The Angels remained terrifying, if not became more so each time we saw them. River Song's story makes perfect sense. Rose Tyler was never a good character so I guess I didn't notice when she was as useless as I thought she always was, and The Empty Child was an amazing story that featured a perfectly self-sufficient, confident female main character to counteract anything you -perceive- happened to Rose. The Angels Take Manhattan brought back The Angels because he had a good idea with them: Rory getting caught up in their self-sustaining slaughterhouse. Don't know why that was a bad choice to end the characters on. Would you rather The Daleks for the 935th time? He created one of -the- most memorable monsters that easily rival the Daleks and Cybermen, I think he has every right to use them for a finale for once.

It was the doctor's darkest hour. He lost. How is that not shitty for him? He was given a glimmer of hope that things would work out in the end, yes, but it was darker before that for him. He never loses, not so completely. And he didn't go shopping for a new coat he probably had it in his Tardis. I don't really know how a bit of a costume switch up has any bearing on a story but fine, whatever. How did we not know about Amy's best friend growing up? Probably because we hadn't talked about her school life? Or maybe because she hadn't been there the first time 'round, but then was re-written into the time stream by The Silence afterwards? Why is that such a sticking point to enjoying a story? And also Nazi Germany was ""Trifling"" because he was deliberatly making them appear silly, useless, and weak. He was basically giving Nazi Germany the middle finger by turning them into a joke, just like has been done by everybody from Loony Tunes to Hogan's Heroes. Nazi Germany was a place to make jokes, it was not intended to be a character or a serious threat.

true,the_leander,null,null,"&gt;Old u-boats like this one were not very fast or very maneuverable underwater, and most surface ships were much faster (IIRC, they managed single figures underwater). The greatest disadvantage was that they were diesel powered, and as such could fill with toxic gas and therefore needed to go to the surface every few days/hours to get fresh air. 

Toxic gasses both from breathing and in the form of fluorine gas that was produced by the batteries. Their main hindrances were their shape and the fact that both the batteries and electric motors of the day were very low performance. The flip side is that they were incredibly quiet, even by modern standards. Snorkelling was understood even in WW1, though it wasn't until WW2 that equipment to do it was made mainstream.

&gt;the important difference being that they carry batteries of sufficient size and quality to *stay under for weeks*, rather than hours, and use their generators to power up the batteries on the surface.

Haha, no. Look up snorkeling.

A complete disaster.

Chelsea loanees Piazon and PvA were once again important at Vitesse tonight. Heerenveen - Vitesse ended in  2-3 thanks to two goals by Lucas Piazon (one free kick and one field goal), and a beautiful goal in the final minute by left back Patrick van Aanholt (assist: Piazon). 

Van Aanholt played a good match as left back after returning from his injury. No big errors and as stated earlier he scored the winning goal in the final minute.

Piazon (as left winger) is my man of the match as he slipped past the Heerenveen defenders time and time again, and most importantly scored two goals.

Atsu's performance as midfielder was less fortunate as he made a few grave defensive mistakes, but I'm not sure why our coach (Bosz) lets him play so close to the defenders in the first place considering he is an offensive minded player.

Tiny studio flat is £365/month + £20/month electricity (heating never comes on and lights are always off). I never go out to drink and average spending about £3/day on food which I could improve upon. No car which means no petrol, insurance, etc. Cycle everywhere. Still get to enjoy life and take the odd budget trip to Europe and can always find cheap, fun things to do around the city. Just start putting a tiny amount away each month and stick to it, even if it's just £10-£15. Cut out as much unnecessary spending as you can and add it to this each month. Your bank may offer a ""keep the change"" program that rounds up purchases made with a debit card and deposits the difference into your savings. Enrol in it! Shop around to see which bank offers the best interest rate on your savings. Lloyd's offer a cash ISA with 1.5% interest up to ~£5.2k per year, tax free. First Direct offer almost 2% on their ISAs.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; 200,000 Gurkhas have died or been wounded fighting Britain's wars. 

This is a pretty suprious statement. There were 20,000 Gurkha casualties in WWI and 32,000 in WWII (I'm not sure how many of these were fatalities). **HOWEVER**... its suprious because up until 1947 they were **not** part of the British Army but rather the British Indian Army. This army was actually three seperate armies created from the amalgamation of British East India Company regiments after the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The three armies were the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Bengal Army - the latter of which included the Gurkha regiments. In 1947 **after** the two world wars, British India was partitioned into two independent nations, the Union of India and the Dominion of Pakistan and 6 of the 10 Gurkha regiments were transfered to the British army.

It may seem pernickety in the 21st century, but in the 1800s and first half of the 1900s there was a clear distinction between an indian *""Sepoy""* unit under British control, and a military unit that was actually British. Hence why the British army was a seperate formation to the British Indian Armies, or the East India Company armies that preceeded them.

&gt; Your arguments could be used in almost any situation to justify the exploitation of the vulnerable. 

I see your point but I don't agree that it applies here. Women in Britain should recieve equal pay because **the state** is responsible for them and has a moral responsibility to strive for equality. **However** the Gurkhas entered into a contract with the MoD and a full pension was never part of that (I think they get about 1/7th the amount of other units)... The poverty of Nepal is not our moral responsibility - at least not beyond our wider international aid obligations.

I can somewhat see your logic behind ""equal pay for equal work"". But whilst to an outsider the Army may seem like one contiguous unit, it is actually formed up of many very different units. Its only a relatively recent thing that all soldiers get paid the same. Traditionally this was not the case - with for example Cavalry troops being paid more than infantry soldiers, or more recently parachute infantry being paid more than mechanised infantry. Also consider that the majority of Gurkha lads joining are not up to the same educational standards as their British colleagues. (and considering you need something like 3 C grade GCSEs to join the Army that's really saying something)... so it isn't necessarily fair to say they are doing the same job from the same starting point.

----

To reiterate, my biggest objection to this is that it's immensley selfish of the Gurkhas, because it threatens the future of their Brigade. If they are going to push for full equal pay and pensions then there really isn't much point recruiting from Nepal. They make good soldiers - but so do the British, and we have no shortage of unemployed youngsters that need a trade. The whole point of the Brigade of Gurkhas was that it taught them transferable skills from intangible things like leadership to practical things like learning to drive/electronics/engineering/English language etc. that they could take back to Nepal at the end of their 17 years.

But I do think that there is some ""bite to his bark"" because as far as I know, or at least in the new series, he's the very first doctor to asks for favors or debts to be payed and pretty much raised an army and started attacking others to blackmail them to give out information. (Like blowing up all these Cyberman just so Rory could get the answer to his question.)

And in the last season when the distance between him and the Ponds grew he did grow more aggressive, like in that Wild West episode he was about to downright murder someone.
But yeah, unlike the 10th Doctor who took actions into his own hand he was is more like someone who solves problems with a silver tounge and his magical screwdriver that he uses way too much. (Seriously, the 11th Doctor uses the Screwdriver way too much. Scanning everything all the time, flicking it and looking at it.)

I'd be incredibly surprised if that was a digitised and restored screen capture or Pertwee-era promo photo; the lighting alone convinces me this is a modern photo

Most people don't ever get chosen so it isn't a major concern. A relative of mine is 75 and has never been chosen in their life. When you hit 70 that is the cut off for being chosen. However it is a serious civic, legal duty and most people don't realise how serious it is till their letter plops onto the doormat.

In the many hours I had to think on this subject I realised that the jurors are the silent victims of crime. Everybody forgets about them. They just have to witness evidence, observe and ultimately judge. It's different to a TV show as you know that this crime potentially did happen. Usually you can't talk to many people about the evidence either. The responsibility for the final judgement lies with the 12 members of the jury. A judge may be called a 'judge' but the real judgement lies with the jury. 

I feel a better person for completing jury service and I think most people do. You judge people objectively, as you would expect to be judged if you were brought forward accused of a crime.

The courtroom process itself is very interesting - if a bit time consuming. The court clerks have full responsibility for the jury and will help with any problems.

true,todd360,null,null,I think that's the point of Smith's incarnation really. The classic Doctors didn't have the reputation to rely on as much and naturally were a bit more hands on but a lot of the time succeeded through wit and guile rather than outright aggression. Nine and Ten were both very soon after the Time War so naturally were more aggressive and hands on. After regenerating again he became less so and did start to overly rely on his reputation which did ultimately backfire on him as has been said with the alliance and the silence banding together in groups to take him down. And by Asylum of the Daleks he realises he's gotten too big and follows Clara's example and begins wiping himself from the universe. But as a result becomes more violent and impulsive like his previous incarnations due to trying to not fall back on his reputation like in Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and A Town Called Mercy. It's not until The Snowmen he manages to find the right balance again. I think the Akhaten speech was just him being hopeful rather than thinking highly of himself.

true,todd360,null,null,That's pretty much already common knowledge at this point. John Hurt himself said as much in an interview. Whether he unintentionally let it slip or not we don't know. But he certainly implied as such months ago. As for the miscount of the regenerations that I think is in regard to the 13 lives limit of the the time lords. In a separate interview Moffat said it would be addressed in the Day of the Doctor and had to be for a reason. If we take Hurt into account as a missing regeneration then this would make Capaldi his final life. Which wouldn't require the 13 lives issue to be tackled just yet. But if you think back to the end of Season 4 where Ten gets shot by a Dalek you see another regeneration most people skip over. Since he didn't change appearance no one really counts it as a regeneration but he was dying and he did heal himself. He also then siphoned the remaining energy OUT of himself and into the hand. Which means that regeneration energy is no longer in him and technically got used up. Regeneration is supposed to be biological so it stands to reason that Time Lords have a finite amount of that energy inside them (enough for 12 regenerations for a total of 13 lives) which would explain why Eleven using some up to heal River's hand would piss her off so much. If it is as precious as she implied then that siphoning off of so much into the hand that created the Meta-Crisis Doctor should count as a full regeneration in itself. Therefore that would mean that Eleven is actually Thirteen which would then deem it necessary to explain how the Doctor is going to regenerate again in the 50th.,0,1382230267,null,0,false,0,ccvaybs,t3_1ot3i1,t1_ccvaybs,t3_1ot3i1,null,1429069827,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

He absolutely destroyed that sun god. The fucked up leaf bullshit absolutely ruined this amazing moment for the doctor and it pisses me off.

The fact that he didn't know it was a trap based on the fact that he could actually do that, was the whole entire point of it all.

&gt; Pandorica Opens

Another amazing show of what the doctor represents, with the flair of 11. 

I mean think about it like this. If I pointed a shot gun in your face and said ""I am talking."" you would probably shut the hell up. Then I would ask, who was going to take this thing from me..... you wouldn't do a damned thing. That's exactly what happened here, except it's the doctor and he could do a whole lot worse than a damned gun and they all know it.

The ENTIRE POINT of some of these is that he doesn't have to act most of the time because he has already proven himself to be so fucking deadly in the past. Actually, once again another ENTIRE POINT of an episode/plot. This is exactly why they were locking his fucking ass up in the first place. He was going to destroy everything and everyone there fully believed he was capable. Hence, locking him up.

To end this I would just like to say that I agree, 11 didn't ""do."" some of the things that the last two doctors did. But look back. Were they good things? Were they seen as good by even us as viewers who faun over the doctor? Or were they really kind of terrible.... I mean at times it was only because of his companion that he even survived (Even shown in alternate realities that this is true.) And I just think that a really large point was him not having to do anything at this point. I actually hoped to see this come back to bite him a little more... but... I did get the whole good man goes to war arc, where they used the fact that they couldn't possibly get away from the doctor... to their advantage... And I personally think the whole leaf nonsense was just absolutely awful, and should have been a show for how incredible the doctor and his life has been. It still is, but having it fail for absolutely no reason and have it's place taken over by a leaf... just awful.. 

The real question I have though is do you think he was ever bluffing? I mean lets say you don't agree with me on anything I've said here. Lets say you think the leaf thing actually makes sense. Lets say you think A Good Man Goes To War was nothing. Lets say all of that....

Start wherever you want. Get a friend to pick a random episode...start at the beginning of the new series, start at the old series. It wont matter until you find one you mesh with that gets you hooked.

People are going to disagree with me, but the reality is, everyone will tell you something different and it's going to be biased answers (favorite doctors, episodes, personal preference etc)

If you end up liking Doctor Who, it wont matter where you start. You'll like it because of what it is, not when it is. 

I was told to start at the 9th Doctor but naturally didn't listen, so I started randomly in the middle of the 11th Doctors, not knowing ANYTHING about the Doctor at all (I'm talking nothing, didn't even know what a Dalek was). 

My first episode was Vincent and the Doctor. I only picked it because I like Vincent Van Gogh as an artist. I was really lucky in picking an episode that didn't connect too heavily with other episodes, so I wasn't lost.

The end of that episode happened and I was a sobbing mess. That was it. I was emotionally invested in the Doctor and everything he stood for. From there I watched End of time part 2 to watch the regeneration of the 10th doctor to the 11th. Admittedly I was a little lost, but I fell even more in love with Matt Smiths doctor as soon as he started wiggling his fingers and touching his face. 

I binged on Doctor Who over the period of two weeks and the rest is history. I'm back at the 9th doctor to get caught up on everything and I just don't care for him. He's great, but he's not *my* doctor.

There is no wrong or right answer when picking an episode, but asking anyone where to start is like asking which Doctor is the absolute best. You'll just have to find out for yourself! :)

You guys are the biggest bunch of whinos I've ever read.

We've only lost ONCE, in 8 games. We've won FIVE times in EIGHT games.

You know what happened in our first 8 games last year? We lost 3, drew 3, and won 2.

You guys act like we're running for the title. I'm optimistic as fuck and I love goading that we're top of the table this and dominating that, but when we lose you really need to be gracious in accepting it.

true,scribacious,null,null,"The past 3 hours has been a thrilling ride for me since clicking on this link and reading the comments here. I've got a theory of my own concerning the 50th and the current season finale. Please note that I started out knowing very few spoilers from after the Christmas episode first featuring Clara (because I haven't seen the episodes from there to the latest) and I didn't know much history of old Dr. Who episodes before the reboot series starting with the 9th doctor. Here's my guesses after a little googling and seriously spoiling myself with detailed summaries and explanations:

Beforehand, I noticed that the reboot series had a lot of episodes where the Doctor had to deal with repercussions of decisions that he had made in his past and his future. With this in mind, I googled for information concerning [](#s ""the Hurt Doctor. Found here http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Howling:Theories_on_John_Hurt , I followed links for more info to http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Other , http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Rassilon , http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Loom , http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dream , and the http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Celestial_Toymaker."")

[](#s ""From there, I began to think that what the Doctor has running from since the beginning was the Crystal Guardian. This Guardian had continuously lured or kidnapped the Doctor and his friends and companions throughout his timeline. On that same wiki site, the Crystal Guardian is referred to as both a Guardian of Time and as a Great Old One. What else is referred to as a Great Old One? The Great Intelligence. Both of them can appear in dreams and play games."")

[](#s ""I flashed back to Amy's Choice concerning the game through dreams that they played, and The Doctor's Wife concerning the encounter with House outside of the Universe who wanted to go into the present universe. The gods of the pre-universe and the present universe are at play here. That's why the Doctor seemed to recognize and fear the Dream Lord. That's also why House spent his time luring Time Lords to play with him, just like the Toymaker did in the past."")

[](#s ""Now to tackle the question Who is John Hurt? He is the Doctor's past. I think he is either an Alternate Version still in form 8 of the Original Doctor who is now in form 11, or he's the Original version of the Doctor still in form 8 making Doctor 11 the Alternate Doctor. Back to the wiki, http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Guardians_of_Time . The page states that *...the Fourth Doctor mentioned 'Guardian technology' in reference to the first Key to Time.... It may also have been that the Key was equal to the power of the Guardians.* My conclusion: John Hurt used Guardian technology/Great Old Ones power to apply the time lock to end the Time War and it corrupted him. Also, to flash back onto arc where there were two 10s and the Doctor Donna. John Hurt may have made an alternate Doctor or was made as an alternate Doctor in a similar way using the same powers. Eleven resents the choices that he made, and has separated himself from the Hurt Doctor. The reason why Clara or the GI didn't know about the Hurt Doctor? Well, how best to hide from time than using a Key to Time/Guardian technology/Great Old Ones powers, or being banished as punishment for breaking the promise to be a healer/savior? By the very name of Hurt, this Doctor used peace and sanity as an excuse to harm. Do you remember how Eleven was so angry at Amy for nearly forcing him to harm the space whale for the sake of sanity/reason?"")

true,sacredstones,null,null,"When we signed Alberto my first thought was that this spelled trouble for Jordan Henderson. Yes, Alberto is still adjusting, he's still young, we haven't seen much of him. But from what clips are out there and the performances he's put in, its not hard to see that they are two very different players. Both are very technical, but the difference is in their decision making. You could see it today when both of them were on. Alberto looks to pick at a defense, playing quick probing passes and getting into more aggressive positions between defenders. Henderson plays passes into space(which usually means backwards or sideways) and usually positions himself the same way.

Unless he magically becomes a great tackler, I don't see him being a midfield starter in the future over the likes of Allen, Suso, Alberto, Lucas, and Coutinho. He works hard and rarely misses passes, but thats not enough for a midfield player if we want to be challenging for top 4. 

I know he was playing Holding mid today, so maybe he was holding back..but i just don't see him trying to develop the attacking side of his game. He's a utility player, a jack of all trades, but we need a spark in the midfield that he has never really offered.

He'll start plenty of games this season simply because of his workrate and experience. I don't think we'll see a Gerrard Hendo pairing again unless there is at least one true CAM (basically coutinho) on the field or if Lucas is injured. Lucas and Hendo are okay, because Lucas keeps the tempo of the game high. But Hendo and Gerrard today took too long making decisions and neither one of them tried to get forward and build the attack down the middle. This was against a 10 men Newcastle. This is not a top 4 pairing, and I hope we don't have to see it again in the future unless we are playing a truly shit team.

Put Townsend in front of Naughton, giving the left side some speed and extra threat, because Townsend is pretty two footed. And then put Lamela on the right, with Walker backing him up and providing overlapping runs.

It's still early in the season, and we haven't strung together a good 90 minutes in any of our games, I think more people would agree that we've only played a strong 45 in the majority of our games. 

I would rather be sitting at 7/8th right now saying we're showing a lot of promise and our team are switched on and are just looking for that 1 missing element or those goals that are slipping away that will come good by the halfway point of the season, that sitting here at 3rd right now, knowing that if our team continues to play the way they're playing, we will drop significantly.

Our set piece defense is still horrifically poor, which sadly has become somewhat of a Liverpool hallmark lately.

Don't get  me wrong, I think we have an extremely good chance of getting top 4 this season, as I don't feel that spurs are as good this season as they will be in 2 or 3. We just have to battle it out between Mufc, Chelsea, Gunners and City, and Man U I feel is the least likely to win the league this year. 

The most disheartening thing for me, hasn't been our technical ability, or lack of composure in the final third, a cliche you always hear referenced in football, but it's the lack of desire that our midfield has been showing lately. Whether it's Stevie G in our past few games, Hendo who has a great engine, but doesn't seem to use it for 90 minutes, or Lucas, who truly shocked me in our last game with his lack of effort.

Effort is contagious, and works both ways. If Gerrard makes a screaming run up the pitch, people will follow, but when he or another midfielder dawdle along, that's when you see the team look like a bunch of ghosts waiting for the game to come around.

Edit: Would also like to mention Victor Moses is a breath of fresh air. Completely the opposite to our play whenever he seems to get the ball. I don't care if he loves to take his man on 1v1 or 1v2 and lose the ball, he tries hard whenever he's got the ball, and always gives it maximum effort.",0,1382252548,null,0,false,0,ccvhoqz,t3_1ot9kl,t1_ccvhoqz,t3_1ot9kl,null,1429066685,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

United will get stronger. They can only get stronger really, they are capable of spending money in Jan. It's just a question of how far behind they get an how far they have to come back.



City are consistently inconsistent, good win against west ham but that followed some bad results for what a team like that should be expecting. 


Chelsea keep shooting themselves in the foot every first half but come out with a convincing score which is all the supporters will care about.


Spurs are the definition of a team who need time to gel.

-------------------Soldado------------------

Sigurdsson just doesn't provide what we need, we need finesse and someone who adds width, Sigurdsson provides neither.

I want to see Lamela given his first start, even if he haven't earned it yet. I put him on the left because I think Townsend deserves to keep playing on the right because of his performnces on the right. Lamela played on the left before so it shouldn't be a problem.

I picked Sandro over Dembélé even though Dembélé have been quite good recently but I think we need someone who actually protects the back four against Villa. Paulinho have been our best player so far this season so he is nailed on to start.",0,1382256774,null,0,false,0,ccviffq,t3_1ot3ts,t1_ccviffq,t3_1ot3ts,null,1429066267,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

On another related note. I always felt the series was about Jack Crawford and Hannibal, at least looking at it as two old men playing chess made me really enjoy the series more.

Also having kids smoking on the playground is going to be pretty unpleasant for the non-smoking kids. I know it's outside but you can still smell someone smoking from a pretty long way off and it's not nice.

Two: the rich aren't automatically bastards.  The effect they have might actually be quite small.  What do I mean?

They might bid insane amounts for a luxury place in Kensington, but there's so few ""ultra rich"" out there that their effect on the market as a whole is small.

It was one of the delights of watching Saints from our days in league 1, and a huge reason why I loved Adkins so much - he got the players working for each other, for the club. Like they were desperate for every result.

Osvaldo doesn't have it. Yet. Maybe he will. But he looked casual, at times disinterested. It was such a stark contrast to the rest of the team. We were at Old Trafford for fucks sake!

One example was when we were pressing high and won the ball (it was when Evra went for a bizarre cross-pitch chip and we won the ball from it). The ball ran to Osvaldo, who with players flooding past him desperate for the ball tried to nonchalantly chip the ball past a defender. It didn't come off, and he complained to the ref about handball instead of trying to get the ball back.

I'd like to see him on the bench for the next game (that Rickie chap isn't bad after all). Let him know, doesn't matter how much we paid for him/am paying him now/how well he can play for Italy. If he doesn't put the effort in on the pitch he's not gonna be in the team.

On the other end of the spectrum, there's Lallana, who came through the youth here after many years, and started playing for us in the Championship. Schneiderlin similarly came when we were in the Championship, the season before we were relegated. Both were young, and although there were possibly some offers, the season after we went down we were taken over, and had some ambition. They both benefited greatly from staying in the team and getting a lot of game time through both leagues, and are now playing at a high level in the Premiership. 

One of the main differences is that yes, Lallana seems likely to stay for most of his career, but we can't really know about Schneiderlin, what if AC Milan come knocking, or PSG or something similar?

---

 

*The reasons are simple to understand. In 2011, at the height of the eurozone crisis, citizens of the two countries at the epicentre of the cataclysm – Greece and Italy – bought £400m of London bricks and mortar. The Italian and Greek rich, fearing the single currency would collapse, got their money out of euros and parked it some place where government was relatively stable and the tax regime was gentle – very, very gentle. Considering that tax evasion in Italy and Greece was a significant contributory factor to their debt problems, it just seems grotesquely cynical to encourage this kind of behaviour.*

*But that's what Britain in general, and London in particular, does. The city is essentially a tax haven with great theatre, free museums and formidable dining. If you can demonstrate that you have a residence in another country, you are taxed only on your British earnings.*

*And the savings on property taxes are phenomenal. The property taxes on New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's $20m London home come to £2,143.30 a year. That's $3,430. Clearly, the mayor bought in at the right time. The Google executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is reported to be house-hunting here – he's looking in the £30m (about $48m) price range. Yet he will pay a similar amount in property tax as Bloomberg does.*

*There are other facets of London real estate as a medium of exchange. British gross domestic product has yet to return to pre-crash levels, but the financial services industry has roared back. Banks are paying out big bonuses again, and anyone looking for a safe investment is getting into London property.*",0,1382268529,null,0,false,0,ccvjxzk,t3_1otp7o,t1_ccvjxzk,t1_ccvj6ld,null,1429065560,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Further, the main focus of the current government's message has been 'we have spent too much in the past, now we need to cut costs'. Whether or not this is true, it seems rather weird to be freezing salaries and cutting jobs in the private sector and also raising MPs salaries.

I don't think that £74K is a ridiculously high salary for what is clearly a difficult job, but neither does £66k seems absurdly low. I think that the issue isn't the actual value, but the *increase* and the 'one rule for us and another for the masses' message it implies.

Rich people will see these as different things, rightly too.  They may buy a multi-million penthouse in Knightsbridge as their ""London place"", for the lifestyle, and to show-off to their millionaire mates.  But they're going to treat any other property purchases as an investment.

They're not buying up off-plan basement one-bedroom flats in Shoreditch for the lifestyle it offers, but because they think they can make money off it.  In that sense they're not so very far removed from domestic rich buyers.  There's no reason to believe that this will continue infinitely, why would anyone, no matter how rich they are, buy a property they don't intend to live in if the rental yield is a tiny fraction of what that same money could earn if invested elsewhere?

The only difference between foreign and domestic rich people is that foreign purchases also have the currency factor to take into the equation.  They're not only buying London property but sterling-denominated property.  Given the troubles of the Euro, and the constant bickering about the US government debt, you can see why this is appealing, but by historical standards it's a double-edged sword.

If anything the ""rich foreign buyer"" is just the latest (and perhaps final) in the series of saviours of the housing market:  1980's - deregulated mortgages.  1990's - lower interest rates.  2000's - bankers spending their bonuses.  2010's - foreign money!

For Halifax you can switch from your existing account to the Bonus account with the £5/month.  I'm not sure if you can get the £100 switching bonus if you are already a Halifax customer.

true,doeboy73,null,null,"Total QPR domination in the first half, almost ""taking the piss"" - as we chanted.

The problem is 'finishing off teams'.

Once Kranjkar scored we sat back, this continued into the 2nd half as we tried to pass the ball around **in our own half**. Our defence then got into a strange mess, inviting pressure on themselves.

It's difficult to get your mind around how we go from almost complete domination to conceding; and ... we did it twice.

As we approached the end of the game and injury time, I felt the chances of Millwall scoring were 50/50. Lomas had 4 attacking players on the pitch; something Harry should learn a lesson from.

Harry seems committed to having one striker up front; that's do-able if you have quality attacking midfielders, but Kranjkar had been taken off with an injury, so we were lacking attacking possibilities, particularly in the final 25 mins of the game.

Chevantón was sitting on the bench, twiddling his thumbs. Attack is often the best form of defence, at least keeping the ball up the other end of the pitch helps. Time-wasting with the ball in your own half and even around your own corner flag invites more pressure from the opposition.

The current strategy seems to be the following steps:

1. Play football: Defend well and try to score;

2. Then: Sit back and pass the ball around - attempting to keep possession for the rest of the game.

3. If the opposition then score: Now look to create some goal-scoring opportunities.

Weaknesses of this approach:

* If the opposition score a goal you **must** then work to create that additional goal scoring opportunity to win the game.

* If the opposition score close to the final whistle there may not be enough time to score the reply goal.

We saw that after each time Millwall scored, QPR came back into domination and started looking to score a goal again.

**Conclusions from yesterday's game**

Positives:

Kranjkar: Had a very good game. His last was a little anonymous, so it was great to see him back in form - and that goal means he's got his shooting boots on and I think we can expect to see more goals.

Barton: How the heck he plays with all that abuse is beyond me. I think it began to get to him later in the game as he started time-wasting with the ball after Millwall had scored their equaliser. Otherwise he played very well indeed and provided some much-need physical play and some quality passes.

O'Neil: Looked great. Amazing tackles, passes and play. A quality player.

Dunn: Looked very good, headering everything in our half away, aside fro those two goals - I'll have to watch video replays to understand what happened.

Austin: A really good finish for that goal - composed and well executed.


Negatives:

Austin: One trick pony? (very harsh and unreasonable, I know - Your comments appreciated). The team seems set up purely to provide him with the chance of scoring and he tends to need it on a plate - in my opinion.

Strikers: We actually have 3 first team strikers. One has been banished to the reserves and is scoring goals at an incredible rate of knots, including the fastest ever recorded goal in QPR history, last week.
With these opportunities available, why do we only play one up front? - Thus inviting pressure on ourselves for periods of the game and inhibiting our ability to penetrate the opposition half/box.

Not finishing off teams: None of the other negatives would exist if we had a killer instinct. We need to acquire one for the next 3 games, because we just lost a relatively easy 2 points against a bottom-half-of-the-table team. Burnley is going to be easily be our most difficult game of the season - though I expect to see Austin's best performance so far at that game.

true,cstross,null,null,"I think you'd be startled by how *cheap* it would be to implement. 

I ran the numbers a few years ago. If you're looking for VGA resolution -- low by modern standards -- but with full audio, on the order of 1Tb should hold a *year* of data. At 720p resolution, you need to up that to 3-10Tb ... but that's about £300 of raw hard disk platters. Call it £3000 if you add the infrastructure for a SAN, backup, redundancy, and so on. Now let's triple that figure to £10,000 a year, Just Because. (You wouldn't want to think I'm fiddling the figures to make it look cheap, would you? Even though the cost of a ruggedized wearable camera is well under £500 and storage is getting cheaper every year.)

Now compare this to the cost of a single officer on the beat: £21.5K to £35.5K for a constable in pay alone. Plus their equipment, station/office space overheads, support personnel; if you trust the Taxpayer's Alliance figures, each ""bobby on the beat"" [represents £800,000 per year](http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/home/2012/12/research-bobby-beat-costs-800000-year.html) in total force spending, based on estimates of only 12% of officers being on patrol at any time. Even if availability were 100%, each officer would still be costing around £98,000 per year: cars with blues and twos, training, office space, cells, control room infrastructure, forensics and SOC support -- none of this is free. 

So what I'm proposing to do is to add £3000-£10,000 on top of an £800,000 bill per officer-on-the-beat/year.

What you get in return for lifelogging everything every officer does in public; well, in Rialto, California, they've done pretty much that -- 50% of officers wear mini-cams when on duty. They ran a year-long trial. The result has been a [80% fall in complaints against police officers and a 60% reduction in use of force by cops](http://carloz.newsvine.com/_news/2013/07/19/19560742-study-police-force-where-12-of-officers-wear-mini-cameras-see-88-drop-in-citizen-complaints-those-so-equipped-use-force-60-less-often). It works both ways: police officers behave more professionally, and members of the public are less likely to kick off, when they know everything's being recorded. Upshot: this *saves money* by reducing prosecutions, reducing complaints and lawsuits against the police, and presumably through other second-order effects: fewer police working hours lost to injury or PTSD, less corruption, and so on.

Speak to your union rep if you have one. If not, that's a valuable lesson. Always be unionised.

It's typical of MP's to have a hands-off system that miraculously does exactly what they want it to. MP's are NOT high-level executives, they are public servants, same as the civil service, and should be getting exactly the same terms and conditions as these. If this means a pay cut, so be it. If they don't like it, then they can do a Mensch and go peddle their wares elsewhere.

What?    

[Buy this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdPHXv8Hzj8). That's £70 for single units directly from HK, likely less in higher quantities. Let's take your 1 TB estimate at face value (which seems accurate) and get three of those for redundancy, that's £150 (year) + £70 + £40 (2x micro SD cards). Even if we take your £300/year for storage figure (higher quality video) that is still just £3,000 + £350 (replacement cameras) + £100 (replacement micro SD cards) for ten years.    

I'm not sure where you got your mythical £3K equipment cost figure. I've installed SANs and while they are expensive for the initial investment they scale VERY well with additional storage (i.e. get cheaper and cheaper). Claiming £2,700 **per officer** in SAN and other equipment costs is just outright insanity. Maybe that much for the first five, then £0 for the next ten.    

Or let's just re-frame this whole thing. Let's say you outsource all of the storage requirements to Amazon's AWS platform (Amazon Glacier), 1 TB of storage on that platform (including 100 GB/month of upload and download data) is $22/month or $264/year or £163/officer/year for 1 TB or near £500/officer/year for 3 TB.    

So your infrastructure estimates are why your figures look so high. Hard to take £2700/officer/year in instructure costs seriously, unless that also pays for them each to get a personal SAN.

If you claim things that go against the basis of our understanding of weed, you better have some citation. 

I've yet to read a study that has proved any form of physiological dependence.

And yes, I know it can be a huge problem, as I went through the same thing, hell at my peak I was spending £600 on weed a month. 

The point being, my dependence was due to issues in my life that I didn't know how to deal with. So rather than deal with them, I got high and forgot about them. 

It was the solution to the problem, not the problem itself. The issue with weed is that it's great for avoiding problems, but does nothing to solve them, so without keeping it in check, becomes a problem in of itself - but the key point is *weed doesn't cause this.* Lack of self control causes this. 

&gt;But smoking on a daily basis, especially if you are a teenager, and it will leave a mark on you.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Kone is a very smart player off the ball, he moves well and develops space for others around him. At Wigan he was, at best- OK on the ball. He wasn't afraid to take players on, his distribution wasn't bad (his low balls in the box were particularly good at Wigan) and his shooting was above mediocre... Since coming to Everton though he is fighting off bench scraps, it seems he is trying to turn himself up to 11 whenever he comes on, rather than just playing football. 

As a centre forward he should be completely ignored, but if he can get a few performances under his belt, I can see him doing a good job on the right wing. It seems with Pienaar back that it might be sensible to play him on the left, where he shines with Baines- this would shift Mirallas out to the right (which is fine), where he can rotate, or be a 60 minute player for Kone if the game dictates. 

The issue with Mirallas is that he requires space to run into and exploit to get the most out of his game. If a RB (or LB) comes to him, he can take him on and get a good cross into the box, or cut in and take a shot. This was where pretty much all of his goals last season.

Against grittier teams who are throwing men back though he tends to get crowded out and doesn't get the space he requires to do his thing in. This has been a problem this season, and was one last season also, and Kone could remedy that. 

Kone it very good at creating his own space and will punish deeper defences much more than Mirallas- but he needs to get his head in the game and settle down in a blue shirt before that is even an option. He, like Mirallas is a dribbler who takes players on, but his technique and effectiveness rely on different things due to his stunning change of pace, but not amazing top speed. 

The irritating thing is that we got dumped out of the League Cup by a pathetic excuse for a Prem team, so we don't have the option to rotate and test players without the pressure of the league. 

---

Reverting back to what I said before though, I don't see him as an option up top. He has shown he requires confidence to score goals, and confidence only comes with gametime, something we simply cannot give as a number 9. His lack of ability to hold up the ball is also a huge question mark for me, which limits the options of him coming on late in the game, and had me scratching my head as to why Bobby brought him on yesterday when we were trying to protect a slender lead.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;&gt;    You sound as certain of their wrongness as they are of their correctness, with the added bonus of preaching a position without even the possibility of evidential proof.
&gt;Ah, the old ""prove a negative"" chestnut. Sorry, it's not going to wash. If I claim I can see a pink unicorn, the burden of proof is on me to justify my claim with evidence, not on you to disprove it by claiming ""ther's no evidence that there isn't"". Likewise with any claims of a god or supernatural entity.

If you're making a positive statement about the certainty of something, I would say that if you wish for people to accept it as rational it is up to you to explain the certainty, even when the thing you are certain of is the absence of something. I know a core tenet of capital-A atheism is to maintain that you may preach the absence of God with no evidence, but you've got to accept that to the rest of us you're as mental as anyone else claiming to know something about God.

We've all heard the '""oh, the prove a negative chestnut"" chestnut' many times, but that misses the point; when you're preaching to a bunch of people who do not know whether there is a God or not that there absolutely is no God you're the one in the position of certainty. The onus is absolutely upon you to explain why you know and they do not.

&gt;&gt; No, we should study their beliefs, and accept that even if we don't think they're correct, they clearly do and perhaps we could or should modify our behaviour and responses based on that.
&gt;No. Again, why should anyone validate someone who is obviously delusional?

I didn't say ""validate"" I said ""study"". And we do that because it's interesting. Again, just like the pink unicorns.

I'm just trying to say that there are ways to do this that discourage housing speculation, without necessarily being the next ""soak the rich"" scheme.

Property taxes, per se, aren't a bad thing, and it would probably be fair to increase property taxes across the board, not just on houses which cost over £2m.  But if you're going to do this, rather than raising taxes on hardworking families, make it so that the overall tax burden is shifted to property.  For instance, reduce income taxes, while at the same time introducing a new property tax scheme.

Yes. I'm aware of this, your sort have been all over the Internet doing that for the past 15 years and none of you have yet managed to do it in a way that convinces me that you know there is no God any more than any other religion knows that there is one.

I, generally, claim I do not know whether or not there is a God and, hence, I think that capital-A Atheists are wrong to be certain of God's absence. I don't claim that the existence or absence of a God is unknowable, so I'm conveniently sat right on the fence holding a position that has nothing at all to claim or defend - I claim complete ignorance. Capital-A atheists are taking the position that there is no God and that this is known. They, therefore, are making the claim and are the ones who should defend it.

&gt; Which is extremely easy to do, seeing as there is precisely zero evidence that said thing exists

I've met several people who claim to have spoken to, or otherwise interacted with God. Christians do keep telling me that if I try really hard to find Jesus I will. This isn't very good evidence, but it is more than zero. It's more than exists for, say, underpants gnomes.

&gt; and then look me straight in the face and call me ""mental"" again for refuting just one more ridiculous assertion of a ""god"". What makes my crazy entities any different than yours?

I'm calling you mental for being so absolutely certain of something for which there's no real possibility of proof. I'd do same for anybody getting worked up about the nonexistence of Santa or the Loch Mess monster in the face of people open to the existence of those.

MPs used to have a very generous expenses system, whilst there were formally rules about what could be claimed, much of the anti-fraud regulation was left up to the conscience of individual MPs. To make matters worse, because of political pressure dating back to the 80s, their salary hadn't seen much real increase over the years. Instead, MPs were unofficially using their expenses to supplement their pay. 

This came to a head a few years ago when the shit hit the fan during the expenses scandal. After that the public weren't in the mood to put up with any more from the expenses system. So MPs brought in IPSA, which regulates their expenses, and they also their pay is set independently of them. It was felt that this would solve political issues about the use of expenses, and around pay. What has happened, instead, is that the public has disregarded that pay is set independently of MPs, and want them to overrule the independent body who sets the pay award. Now, they could, but then they have to admit that there can never really be any substantive regulation of MPs - since whenever there is any kind of public pressure, they'll just be expected to overrule the regulators. 
Incidentally, IPSA has also been a fucking disaster when it comes to expenses. They like to claim that they have a 0% fraud rate. Do you know how they achieve this? The new system is both more restrictive AND more expensive than the old system. They literally spend more evaluating some claims than the total value of the claim. Even if these claims were entirely fraudulent, it'd be cheaper to just pay all of them than to do these reviews... 

But, the public wants what it wants. Until it doesn't. ",0,1382278240,null,0,false,0,ccvlj4l,t3_1otvo5,t1_ccvlj4l,t3_1otvo5,null,1429064820,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Im glad there is no Naughton, but at the same time...I am a bit worried about Vlad. He has looked great going forward, but has been quite mistake prone in his appearances. A bit like our CB version of Walker. We'll see.

Odd choice with Holtby over Eriksen, not that it should be an issue as they are both good but we all know Eriksen is another level to Holtby right now. Could be just squad rotation after the internationals though.

**Sandro**


No problem with Sandro starting over Dembele, he should be a rock in front of that back four. This is just squad rotation.

I would of liked to have seen Townsend and Lamela play on the wings today, I know he has grabbed us some goals but him being played makes us very narrow - which has been a huge problem recently.

It's not unheard of that cannabis withdrawal can lead to increases in anxiety, irritability, physical tension, and decreases in mood and appetite. What people are looking at now is the role that downregulation cannabinoid receptors play in this. However it is worth noting that the effects are mild in most cases, and the half-life of delta9-THC means that it leaves the body fairly slowly. It's also hard to study in humans because a lot of the research involves dissection. But, there is evidence that some of the substances in weed can create a physiological dependence in chronic smokers. 

&gt; &gt; But smoking on a daily basis, especially if you are a teenager, and it will leave a mark on you.
&gt;
&gt; Again, citation or it's baseless rhetoric.

&gt; I can just as easily say at this point in my life I'm smoking daily and spend around £150 a month, my life is fucking brilliant these days, weed isn't really effecting it all that much any more.

Is it actually brilliant, or does smoking around an ounce of weed a month allow you to avoid problems and be happy with your life? I used to smoke about an ounce a week, and thought things were going really well. But when supply issues forced me to stop, I found things lacking. The main reason I never started smoking on a regular basis again was because it killed my motivation, but I still enjoy the odd joint every now and again.

Police corruption is not ""rife"".  That's fucking inane.  Try and buy your way out of a traffic ticket, or a conviction, see how that goes down.  In fact, I'll go one better - try and *give* your local officer a couple of hundred quid, purely as a gift, and see how it goes down.

There is *no evidence at all* of this *culture of dishonesty* he's blabbing on about.  Anecdotes are not fucking data.  The Met spends absolute fortunes on their professional standards department.  We still don't know exactly what happened to ""plebgate"" - fucking ridiculous name - but I will happily put down money that *nobody* is going to come out of it looking good.  Some fucking idiot will have made a stupid mistake, try and get out of it, involved his federation member to help who had an equally fucking stupid idea, and it's all gone tits up.  The idea that some secret shadowy cabal of ACPO officers has planned to bring down the conservative party is fucking ridiculous.

Here's the reality, in my opinion: the entrance standards for police officers are still relatively low, in comparison to job responsibility and pay.  It's also impossible to get fired unless  you cock up colossally.  The result?  There are some serious idiots around, and they stick around.  Sometimes, two of them act like idiots together, and stupid shit happens.  Actual, all out dishonest corruption is still incredibly rare.

The police have been calling for a royal commission on a policing for decades.  One last question - if you think police are really that corrupt, find instances on youtube of blatant police lies.  These days, police are recorded by members of the public whenever they do anything in any way controversiasl - it's a panopticon that's far more efficient oversight than the IPCC will ever be.

1. Go to Zoopla/Nestoria/Findaproperty.com and search for properties matching criteria. Sounds like you want from the centre downwards for transport reasons.
2. If you don't find anything on the above you need to do two things:
 * Set up alerts to get new properties that go through to your phone - this is pretty easy to do on Zoopla. As soon as you get them phone up the agent and insist of seeing the property ASAP.
 * Use the ""contact agents"" feature of Zoopla to e-mail details of what you're looking for to all the local estate agents, they will find you :)

I know somebody who works in Wallingford (also as an ecologist) and the ring road can be a pain. I've no idea what public transport is like in the morning but I imagine a similar deal. Oxford is pretty busy in rush hour so you do need to consider transport when picking a place.

As for bulling most of the people that I have tutored (I live in an area of deprivation and only tutor people that come from my area) have run into problems from middle class kids at University, although none of these where bad enough to to say don't go all of them where unacceptable. Most of these where down to just lacking comprehension that poverty/disadvantage is a real thing, for example one young man that went to a Redbrick to study medicine  ran into problem when he couldn't afford the £700 for the annual sky trip. For him £700 was a big chunk of his annual budget but for most of his peers it was pocket money from Mum and Dad, he faced a lot of hassle over that and a lot of comments about how the University was letting in anyone these days.

- Couldn't disagree more about Holtby. The only reason he's not influencing anything is because nobody can move the ball to the final third. Most of Holtby's touches this match have been around midfield. He's trying so hard to drop back, pick up the ball, and make something happen. Also, did you even see the goal? Holtby is the only reason that scored. He dummied that so beautifully. 99% of players would try to head that in because he was wide open, but he knew where Guzan was positioned, could tell the angle the ball was taking, and let it go. The amount of football IQ Holtby showed on that goal was brilliant.

He seems to always have to dial everything up past the point of plausibility, which is fine every now and then, but yeah...  With Moffat, it's like being in the Buffyverse and trying to figure out what the plural of apocalypse is, but without the winking self-knowledge.

It's the same with his tendency to have the Doctor reboot the universe to get him out of a corner he's painted himself into.  Like, that's just a *cheap* plot device all around.  The Doctor isn't supposed to be acting like a gamer abusing savestates.

Even with the drama angles...  He brought Rory and Amy back just so he could remove them from the show permanently.  They'd already had a fine exit, settling down in London and then having one ""final"" Christmas dinner with the Doctor.

Bang, they're gone.  Time for new companions.  Drop in from time to time when they need a quick paycheck for a special episode.  But no, he takes them out in a weirdly Victorian fashion, pretty much just to wring the tragedy out of it.

Moffat just doesn't seem to have enough sense of restraint, basically.  There is a limit to how over-the-top you can get.

MF : Sandro &amp; Paulinho , best combo we have in my opinion, Paulinho has freedom to roam forward knowing Sandro is able to neutralise counterattacks, a lot of that showed up today  
Townsend : best thing about him, is that he is taking and implementing advice, better shot/pass selection, if he continues to improve (and there is room for improvement, his ceiling is that high) he could be the ""find"" of the season and not only for spurs  
Holtby  great attitude / work rate / football intelligence / ability . I'm so happy he plays for spurs  
 
Soldado : Glad for him and the team to get that monkey off his back, wasnt an easy tap-in to score but he placed his shot very well , it looks way better on the view from behind the goal.  
AVB  what else can i say, he saw the difficulty spurs had last time, changed strategy/personnel. had faith in other players. Great job done by the spurs think-tank

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; People still buy bootlegged alcohol and tobacco though, things one can purchase legally, easily and with some measure of quality control and accountability. So I highly doubt that the illegal trade would be completely done away with, just reduced in scale.

That's the whole point, people still can but the legal market is significantly larger.  I actually don't know anyone that buys bootleg booze or fags (do you? -  I know people that buy stuff from France)

&gt; And I don't think that things like cocaine, heroine or methamphetamine will be legalized and sold openly anytime soon, and this is where the money is (and where this guy made his fortune). All legalizing weed will do is move the issue of weed into trading standards, local council planning departments, and HMRC's areas of responsibility. 

Cannabis is a significant part of the global drug trade.

Cocaine shouldn't be legal until we can source it from non terrorist organisations.  I'm more in favour of decriminalising those kind of drugs (it's a health issue) though, same with heroine.  Drugs like that shouldn't be sold in Tesco, but should be available to addicts via health services.

As it stands, 100% of many relatively safe recreational drugs go to some very dangerous nasty people.  Enough money that these people can build armies that can defend and defeat countries armies and completely control cities (see Mexico), although the drug trade there goes right to the very top (just like the US really - CIA involvement etc).",0,1382291938,null,0,false,0,ccvq221,t3_1oua8a,t1_ccvq221,t1_ccvpwp1,null,1429051175,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Of the 30% they probably don't have possession, how much of THAT percentage is spent defending in their own half? Barca want him for his flexibility and his ball-playing ability, a band-aid for the bullet-wound that Munich delivered to them last CL campaign. 

Also, I'm not sure how this argument can be made after yesterday. We are reminded of his mistakes every time he is named in the lineup, ""he's a good player, but"" - how many other top teams in the world have a centre-half described with ""ya, but?"" 

Any good quality you name about Luiz are not of the defensive type.

Off the ball, he's atrocious - can't stay with a runner, much less goal side, not good in the air, gambles on interceptions &amp; tackles, has no semblance of responsibility, and when he does get caught up the field, his recovering runs are lackadaisical. Also, as exposed by yesterday's error, he doesn't value communication on the pitch - the most fundamental aspect of a good, CONSISTENT, player and team. In the centre of defense, you do not act alone, you form a partnership with the holding midfield, you're CB partner, the full-back on your half of the pitch, and your keeper.

&gt; Prohibition didn't work because people were used to their alcohol, and your suggestion is that we create the same dependency on drugs, meaning that if everything goes terribly wrong we would have absolutely no way to backtrack. No thanks.

People are used to other drugs.  We've been using them for decades (well technically cannabis we've been using for even longer).  it was only made illegal recently.

But it's good to know your opinion is emotional and not factual.

Thankfully we've seen evidence in places like the Netherlands and Portugal that drug abuse has gone down and now state after state in the US is ready to legalise cannabis.  Thankfully the world is changing for the better, regardless of your emotional views on drugs.

He built up to them and he never made the Doctor appear like an almighty being who could just fix everything. When RTD used the Rose-Bad-Wolf-story, it had real consequences for the Doctor. Rose being trapped in a parallel dimension, Martha's ""plan"" to use praying to save him at the end of ""Last of the Timelords"" or Donna's mind being wiped - all examples how the Doctor himself is fallible and vulnerable and unable to just wave a magic wand to fix everything. Moffat's era on the other hand often lacks that part.

My personal opinion: Moffat simply needs someone to control his antics. Many of the great episodes during RTD's era (like The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances or Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead) work because they appear in a larger series of ""normal"" episodes. 
Or another example: ""Blink"" is a great episode, it was creepy and exciting, but somewhat different because it barely featured the Doctor and Martha. But then in his era, Moffat had to bring back the Weeping Angels - a foe that works in close quarters with few characters - and blow them widely out of proportion (Statue of Liberty anyone?).",0,1382295922,null,0,false,0,ccvrmvx,t3_1otz4t,t1_ccvrmvx,t1_ccvp5ju,null,1429050439,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

What it does do is keep control of the market in the hands of criminals.

So I would argue that decriminalization and in some cases legalization would be beneficial.

Gylfi was a superstar at Swansea, and he's been played out of position here. Today he did a very good job on the left side, adding width near the midfield and cutting in well near the opposition goal. He came back and defended well, too. He may not be a flair player like Townsend but he arguably plays as important a role. Generally he's better than Townsend, it's just that this week Townsend has been on fire. And I hope Townsend keeps it up. 

I think all the first-season football watchers (namely Americans, I'm sure) find the flair players easier to respect. Players like Bale and Townsend, where it's easy to see how well they benefit the team. Gylfi won a lot of balls on the left side, crossed over well with Holtby, had good off the ball runs to attract defenders, and really had a solid day. With a quick player like Rose running the touch line it's easier to see how much Gylfi can offer, but just because he does his job without flair doesn't mean he is overrated. He has earned his spot and he keeps playing because he's the best left wing option we have at the moment. If he wasn't, he wouldn't be playing, would he?

true,b2monstermouse,clara,Clara,"A couple of things:

1. Use half the water - i.e. a small package of Jello usually calls for 1c hot water and 1c cold water. If I am doing a mold or want to cut the jello, I use 1/2c hot water (I usually heat the water and jello powder in a saucepan to ensure it dissolves completely), then 1/2c very cold water. (This is how you do ""jello jigglers"") If you're unsure how you'll feel about the texture, up one of the waters to 3/4 or 1 cup.

2. It takes a million years to set, so don't worry about fridge temperature.

3. To get the jello out of the mold, immerse the mold in hot water for a few seconds. To ensure I don't lose too much detail, I usually gently pull the jello away from the sides of the mold, once they come away freely, you should be OK to flip it onto a plate.

I'm not too sure what else you could use the mold for, while keeping it safe to use for food in the future. 

Maybe roll out some fondant and press it into the bottom/sides of the mold so you can decorate a cake? Melt chocolate and coat all sides in a thick layer for a hollow chocolate TARDIS? A (blue) cheese ball?

If you don't care about using it for food later, soap, plaster, clay ... any number of moldable things :)",0,1382297850,null,0,false,0,ccvsfui,t3_1oukna,t1_ccvsfui,t3_1oukna,null,1429050064,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

We're unbeaten away from home, 8 points from 12. That's good.

Sturridge is playing well at the moment, not his best but I think a rest will do him right coming into the Christmas period.

His goal scoring will slow down, because he's just on a good run of form at the moment, like Papiss Cisse was when he joined NUFC. Luckily Sturridge has been able to keep it going longer because Liverpool are a more steady team. He'll start scoring once every other game, rather than every week. That is still top class.

Your statements about Sturridge's confidence don't make any sense, you can't read know what he's thinking or feeling. Plus everybody's reactions are different when they mess up. Balotelli turns around in disgust and looks for someone to blame, Ronaldo puts his hands on his hips and looks up to the sky in disbelief. I even remember when Diamanti had tears in his eyes and ripped his shirt when he fluffed a chance for West Ham. Sturridge does his thing.

How you can't have faith in Sturridge is beyond me.
He's got 20 goals in 26 games. He's already scored a hatrick in his short career with us. He's stepped up and scored against United on 2 separate occasions as well as and single handedly earned us a draw at Chelsea last year.

It's well depressing hueraving had 'normal' relationships and shit and seeing them burn to the ground and only a few months after understanding it was probably all my fault.

So this is why I am who I am, super proud of all my friends who are now in their 30s and all domestic as fuck, whereas I am this fucking volcano that spends their whole life beng careful of being too excited, or too miserable or has to spend all theiir time avoiding shit which makes sense to my ridiculous mind, lijke suicide or massive self-harm.

Turns out that I'm not depressed because of anything like that, nor am I a trap or anything. Im just A dude with a fucked up depressive disorder, that dictates my entire life. Oh well.

I watch every spurs game, and I watched the entire game today. He was pretty much invisible - to a point I found myself genuinely thinking I forgot he was even on the pitch when the commentator would say ""Sigurdsson"".

It may sound a bit contradictory saying other than a goal he doesn't provide much, but it's true. He's taken a few good chances but other than that like you say, hasn't had much about him. I would much prefer to see a Lamela/Townsend setup (providing Lamela starts to get time and show the quality we know is there), of which rotate sides to keep things fresh and catch the opponents off guard. 

We used to do this with Bale and Lennon, and with Townsend and Lamela both lefties it gives us the opportunity to have both a provider and an attacking inverted winger playing (as in one can play on the right cutting in and shooting on their preferred foot, while the other plays on the left providing service).

The thing is, 'crazy' is glorified and sort of adulated as this fucking good state of mind to be in, when the truth is that going crazy is the most terrifying, lonely and fucking awful experience in the world...

I've done lots of things in my life but when I went absolutely crazy was the worst thing in the world.

It's embarrassing, depressing and relentlessly fucking scary, it's literally the worst thing in the world. I cannot believe I got over that shit, and have infinite sympathy for any sufferer of mental health issues, because having a literal voice in your head calling you a scumbag and impelling you to kill yourself is fucking hard as hell to cope with....

I hope people have a bit more sympathy for fucked up people, having been on the darkest of dark sides I just feel so sad for what people suffer, when voices constantly tell you you're no good and you cant sleep because they wont shut up, It's so fucking bleak man, so fucking brutally bleak, and there feels like there is no escape either....

His set pieces are only rivaled by Eriksen as well. So to say he offers nothing if he doesnt score is stretching it a bit.

I wouldnt really be surprised if his drop in form is the result of a massively important international break for him and his country.  Where he played great.

I can't see this example on that page.  At most, these examples suggest that the police don't have a very good understanding of the law in this area (maybe it is too vague or confusing).  But innocent people are arrested all the time - that's what we have trials for.

Also, on the calling a horse gay thing - I'm sure this sounds ridiculous if you've never been through something similar, but most of the way through school I heard these kinds of comments every day (""that's gay"", ""you're a poof"", ""I really hate gay people"", etc.).  I was maybe about 12 when I realised these comments were about people like me, and I don't think I could overstate the fear, self-loathing and hopelessness they made me feel throughout the remainder of my childhood.

As for a rise in consumption, I think it's a given that post legalization we'll see a spike in consumption. From people celebrating, through to the ""it's legal now, let's give it a try"" first timer crowd, to people who used to smoke but feel obliged to light up now that it's legal. And in Portugal, cannabis consumption did rise (as did consumption of coke and MDMA). Over time this will likely fall, but there will be costs associated with this spike.

It was a prolonged one sided attack. If this is what 'soldiers naturally do', why don't we see this happen more often?

John (Jackie) Duddy. Shot in the chest in the car park of Rossville flats. Four witnesses stated Duddy was unarmed and running away from the paratroopers when he was killed. Three of them saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran. He is the uncle of the Irish boxer John Duddy.[34]

Patrick Joseph Doherty. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety in the forecourt of Rossville flats. Doherty was the subject of a series of photographs, taken before and after he died by French journalist Gilles Peress. Despite testimony from ""Soldier F"" that he had fired at a man holding and firing a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs showed Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.[34][37]

Bernard McGuigan. Shot in the back of the head when he went to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief at the soldiers to indicate his peaceful intentions.[6]

Hugh Pius Gilmour. Shot through his right elbow, the bullet then entering his chest as he ran from the paratroopers on Rossville Street.[34] Widgery acknowledged that a photograph taken seconds after Gilmour was hit corroborated witness reports that he was unarmed, and that tests for gunshot residue were negative.[6]

Kevin McElhinney. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety at the front entrance of the Rossville Flats. Two witnesses stated McElhinney was unarmed.[34]

Michael Gerald Kelly. Shot in the stomach while standing near the rubble barricade in front of Rossville Flats. Widgery accepted that Kelly was unarmed.[34]

John Pius Young. Shot in the head while standing at the rubble barricade. Two witnesses stated Young was unarmed.[34]
William Noel Nash. Shot in the chest near the barricade. Witnesses stated Nash was unarmed and going to the aid of another when killed.[34]

Michael M. McDaid. Shot in the face at the barricade as he was walking away from the paratroopers. The trajectory of the bullet indicated he could have been killed by soldiers positioned on the Derry Walls.[34]

James Joseph Wray. Wounded then shot again at close range while lying on the ground. Witnesses who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal stated that Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.[34]

Gerald Donaghey. Shot in the stomach while attempting to run to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. Donaghey was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him. A later police photograph of Donaghey's corpse showed nail bombs in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced him dead shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs. Donaghey had been a member of Fianna Éireann, an IRA-linked Republican youth movement.[34] Paddy Ward, a police informer[38] who gave evidence at the Saville Inquiry, claimed that he had given two nail bombs to Donaghey several hours before he was shot dead.[39]

Gerald (James) McKinney. Shot just after Gerald Donaghey. Witnesses stated that McKinney had been running behind Donaghey, and he stopped and held up his arms, shouting ""Don't shoot! Don't shoot!"", when he saw Donaghey fall. He was then shot in the chest.[34]
William Anthony McKinney. Shot from behind as he attempted to aid Gerald McKinney (no relation). He had left cover to try to help Gerald.[34]

John Johnston. Shot in the leg and left shoulder on William Street 15 minutes before the rest of the shooting started.[34][40] Johnston was not on the march, but on his way to visit a friend in Glenfada Park.[40] He died 4½ months later; his death has been attributed to the injuries he received on the day.

Just because we're investing in Nuclear it doesn't mean we're not investing in other green options. I think that they should be happy we're building Nuclear plants anyway, it's like filtered air compared to using things like coal or oil to generate electricity.

I don't get this part either
&gt;Energy security  
&gt;Nor would new nuclear power stations address the anticipated gap in our future energy supply. This is because nuclear power only produces electricity and so only marginally deals with our need for services like hot water and central heating which are mainly met by gas. Its overall contribution to total energy demand is too small to make a difference to the UK's energy security.

I don't see what the problem is with them only generating electricity, we need electricity. It doesn't mean that we have to stop using gas or whatever too, we can use both. Having hot water is only a small part of what we need.

Also they cite safety but the link i provided shows that it's actually caused less deaths than other green options they want.

They do have some valid points though of course because it would be dumb to say solar and wind isn't good but they just totally ignore the benefits of Nuclear.

Chelsea is not a small feeder club that goes through trial and errors by trying to play players in different positions. We already know which positions every player is good at. We need world class players in almost every position. And David Luiz is world class center back. Why waste his talent playing in a position he is not very good at? DM is the hardest position to play at and it takes years to master the craft. Just because he is talented and can read the game doesn't mean he can automatically play there. And by the way, we are not that desperate to try playing center backs at DM position. His errors can be fixed by Jose. There is always this debate about who should be playing which position? And who should be in the starting line-up?. Some fans want all their favorite players in the starting line up. But, that doesn't mean we should accommodate all these talented players and sacrifice the greater good of the team. We need a balance team that can compete for all the major trophies. This debate was started by EPL football pundits claiming Luiz should be playing at DM. And the vast of majority of us bought into that delusion.

Their point is not that electricity is a bad thing, but that given the demands for energy are greater than solely electricity, investing in a source only capable of providing electricity wouldn't satisfy the energy needs of the UK population. 

On renewable energy - they aren't mutually exclusive; an investment in nuclear energy wouldn't be a bad thing if it were coupled with an investment in renewable energy of equal or greater size, but as far as I'm aware that's not happening - nuclear energy is being pursued as something of a priority. 

And yeah I would guess that it would require a lot of wind turbines to generate the same amount of energy as a nuclear power plant. I think the point is more to develop renewable alternatives to both nuclear and wind farms. I'm not really an expert on energy policy, though, so I don't know what those sorts of alternatives might look like, but it is pretty damn important that these sorts of technologies are developed, and I can see why green campaigners look at all the money invested in nuclear energy as not particularly encouraging, given that it's effect on climate change is likely to be minimal.",0,1382315240,null,0,false,0,ccvz9hc,t3_1ouip1,t1_ccvz9hc,t1_ccvz091,null,1429046769,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
