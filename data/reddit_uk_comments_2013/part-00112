I have said it many times before and I will say it again, Planet of the Dead is the worst episode of Doctor Who that I have seen ever. The basic idea of the story is crap, the acting is crap, Lady Christina is a crap predictable character, and it adds nothing to the continuity of the show that hasn't already been said (it's been pointed out to me that the lady on the bus says 'he will knock 4 times' but we hear that so often so it doesn't add anything new).

There are 3 good things about that episode:

* David Tennant is nice to look at

* Lady Christina is nice to look at

* that funny line about the police box at the end.

There is not one other good thing about this episode. I LOVE almost every episode of the show and this is the only episode that I genuinely dislike. It was a waste of screen time.

It's been proven that gender is a learned behavior (sex is biological). We learn gender when we learn to like princesses or monster trucks, when our parents take us to karate or ballet lessons, when we go to the store and buy nail polish or video games. And you can absolutely be a girl and love motorcycles and be a boy and love ice skating. But gender is constructed by society, and thus genders are treated differently based on these constructs and expectations.

I'm not against a female Doctor because I believe in ""tradition"" or I don't think parents should feel uncomfortable talking to their kids about ""sex changes"". I'm uncomfortable because you cannot keep the writing, plot devices, settings, etc. the same for a male and female Doctor. A Female Doctor, however intelligent, sassy, quick-witted, is still going to be held to different expectations than a Male Doctor. And to deny these differences is frustrating, because it denies that women experience these setbacks, double-standards, (and much, much worse) everyday.

How are my reasons invalid? Again, as I said, just because you CAN do something, it doesn't mean you SHOULD. The Doctor's a husband, a father, and a grandfather. It would just be REALLY weird because it would disrupt these relationships and alienate half of the characters.

My feminist ""attack"" isn't too far fetched though, but I think you guys aren't making the effort to actually look to see the race-gender-sexuality equality that is prevalent in the Doctor Who universe. Also, I would totally love a black Doctor. That I have no problem with, and there are some fantastic candidates. As for gay characters, you have Vastra and Jenny, and if you want your dose of crazy sexual tension, watch Torchwood. Captain Jack is boning everyone left, right, and center. Also, you completely ignored what I was saying about the strong female presence already in the series, including a FEMALE time lord on par with the Doctor, River Song. I don't understand why people aren't content with that. If you are going to attack me and claim that my arguments are invalid, at least address them and refute them rather than taking the weaker pieces and ignoring most of what I actually said.

And why is it that people ignore this hypothetical role-reversal situation? What if I said that Alien should be remade but Ripley should be played by a man?

true,bermyWHAT,uk,Bermuda,"An aeroplane ticket and a hotel and very different than the cost of living on an island.

It's cheaper to fly to certain places because if many airlines go there and there is much demand the obviously the prices will be lower. Tonnes of people fly between Bermuda and Toronto so that's a relatively cheap route plus it's closer than London.

If you're an expat working on one of these island the island may seem cheap to you because you're getting paid quite a high salary plus your company is probably paying for your housing but if you're a local then the prices seem very different.

I've never been to Hawaii but I've had friends from there and I've seen news stories about how expensive things like Milk are there. I'm from Bermuda and I can tell you our milk is expensive too. We have a decent population but it's an island so there isn't enough land to grow all the food we need. And there certainly isn't enough land to manufacture the goods we want to buy. So you're shipping everything to the island which is an extra cost (or if you ""buy local"" that's usually expensive too because it's limited). 

Unless you come from a poor island where there is plenty of land and plenty of labour to grow produce. But then again, to the locals the so-called cheap products aren't.

Not only that, but you make false assumptions about feminists' beliefs. I would not consider another male Doctor a sign of ""female inferiority"". That's flipping ridiculous and insulting. Females aren't inferior no matter who gets cast. I don't think there is anything wrong with our companions. They're wonderful women.

But there's something to be said for the enormous lack of female lead role models in media. Like, where's the representation? Not only that, but if the Doctor did become female, there would be a lot of interesting room for character development and exploration of gender and sexuality.

&gt;Just because he CAN turn into a woman doesn't mean he SHOULD. 

I'm sure that the people who decided who would play the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. Doctors never sat around and said, ""Just because we could make the Doctor a white male again doesn't mean we should.""

Why would you hesitate from doing this? The Doctor is going to change personalities anyways. Changing his gender (or race) does not magically change some deep core personality trait. 

And even if the Doctor *does* identify as a male, that doesn't mean he still can't live in a female body. The 11th Doctor was worried for a moment that he had become a female. This implies that you don't have to identify as a female in order to become one.

The Doctor is a husband, father and grandfather, yes, but to people who are long gone and possibly long dead. Saying it would be ""really weird"" and it would alienate people is just opinion and silly. I'm sure that a 1000 year old blue-box time travelling alien that sets up a date between a terminally ill woman and an old dude in order to save a ship from crashing in a cloud of flying fish isn't weird either.

I think there's a lot of equality in the Doctor Who universe but it's not about equality, it's about representation. Also, it's interesting that you have no problem with race changing but you do with gender changing.

It also isn't about getting a dose of crazy sexual tension. You can get that with gay people, straight people, bisexual people, etc. Besides the fact that River Song isn't a Time Lord (she's a human with augmented DNA), there's a difference between her and the Doctor: one's the lead of a huge sci-fi tv series and the other isn't. In fact, it seems like River is leaving for good. The Doctor is *the* iconic character.

And who said we were ignoring a role reversal? I wouldn't care if Ripley became a man. Maybe then I could see a man get horrifically impregnated by an alien for once.

It's not about the fans - us OR them - it's about what's best for the character. 

I don't think the Doctor should be made ANYTHING he's clearly not, just to please any given group of fans. People use arguments like ""yes, but he changes his whole BODY and personality, so why not gender?"", but the process of regenerations is largely open to interpretation. In my personal opinion, he doesn't CHANGE personalities, he remains the same character but different ASPECTS of him are brought to light in every new form. Meaning he can't become something he hasn't already been on some level - including female. 

To me the Doctor is a formed, developed character. Changing his gender in my eyes is as ludicrous as changing the gender of virtually any other existing fictional character JUST for the sake of changing gender. And no, I don't find gender-change in our society ludicrous, don't get bent out of shape - we are talking about a fictional member of a different species here, one whose actions are dictated by the plot written for him and the main question is: WHY WOULD YOU WRITE THAT PLOT FOR HIM? 

Doctor's change of gender would bring too, too much attention to his sexuality, to his gender, to all the things that aren't adventurous time-space travelling and that in itself would be a step in the wrong direction.

MPs clearly have not the smallest understanding of economics, nor supply and demand.

If all other things remained equal, the lowered demand for meat in the UK would result in excess supply, which would then result in either lower production at the same price or lowered price until demand increased to equal supply again.  I'm pretty sure that farmers are already pushed right to the limit on price by supermarkets, so there is no possibility of lowering prices.  Therefore the result of lowered demand would be lowered supply.

If there were demand for meat from poorer countries (at the current price), then that would act to raise prices until supply again equalled demand.  I'm quite sure that poor countries do not have any demand for meat at the prices the UK pays for it.

So it depends how you look at it. If it's the price someone is willing to pay, then that's more of a truism. If it's looking at the underlying 'value' which is determined by constituent factors then property is currently trading above fundamental value.

If you don't tip, your waiter might be disappointed but they aren't going to be angry or shocked because there are plenty of British people who don't ever tip. If you tip someone in a bar or coffee shop where there's counter service typically they run on a tip jar deal where you put the money in the jar and they split it between staff.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"&gt; Many of the rules in The Highway Code are legal requirements, and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence. You may be fined, given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from driving. In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison. Such rules are identified by the use of the words ‘MUST/MUST NOT’. In addition, the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation which creates the offence. See an explanation of the abbreviations.
&gt;
&gt;Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see The road user and the law) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.

268 is a 'do not', not a MUST NOT.  Thus, if you are taken to court over breach of that rule, it _is_ something that you can argue over.  You can claim it was the safest thing that you could do - it is not automatically wrong (like, say, speeding).  However, in such a case, I would expect a heavy onus to be on the one making such a claim to demonstrate this to the courts satisfaction.

It's that way for a reason - there are times, other than congested traffic, where it is reasonable to be in the right most lane, without overtaking - hence not being at the road crusing speed.

ManU seems to be the rumor that everyone is linking as the true front runner and while ManU has plenty of money i don't think they would be ready to drop £75m+ for any single player which realistically is what they would have to do to even be in the conversation.  Odds are the Real could hold out for £100m+ without any major concerns.

But the other thing to consider is that Ronaldo (just like Bale) is under contract and Perez could very easily tell him to carry on being sad and knocking in goals and there isn't much Ronaldo could do.

IF Real sell Ronaldo and they come after Bale i would imagine that Levy would be an even bigger bastard in negotiations than he normally is because he would now have the knowledge that Real HAVE to make a big signing (probably 2) to appease the fan base.  Levy with that type of knowledge could drive the price higher and higher and laugh his way to the bank.

true,doxed,EN,england,"Others had rejected them. Their need for each other is deeply unflattering - Matt Dickinson


In reuniting one of Europe's richest clubs with one of the world's outstanding managers, success of a sort is almost guaranteed by José Mourinho's return to Chelsea. Trophies, yes - but not the thrilling sense of making history.

Chelsea may win the Barclays Premier League next season, but it will not be like claiming the first title in 50 years when Frank Lampard danced through to score at the Reebok Stadium.

Mourinho may deliver the Champions League, but he cannot be the first manager to hand the cup with big ears to Roman Abramovich.

Chelsea fans rejoice now that they have their José back, and their joy is understandable, but the rest of us approach Mourinho: The Return as the sequel that can never match the original. It is the Part Two that the world did not need.

It was the return that Chelsea did not want either, until they got a little desperate. No one was buying Mourinho's guff yesterday about romance and a place in each other's hearts and this reunion being meant to be.

Roman Abramovich's passion was for Pep Guardiola. Mourinho wanted Manchester United. For two men so accustomed to getting their own way, it must be disconcerting to be united in defeat.

Abramovich and Mourinho fell back into each other's arms because others had rejected them. Their need for each other is deeply unflattering.

It has long been asked whether Chelsea's managerial instability has cost them, given how many trophies they have won through years of upheaval. We can never know if the hiring and firing cost them pots and cups, but it certainly lost them Guardiola. It lost them any hope that the prince of Cruyff-ism would come to London to build a new tiki-taka academy.

Guardiola was so lovingly courted by Abramovich that it must have felt like stalking, but rejecting Chelsea for Bayern Munich was an easy decision.

Every manager is doomed to fail - just at Chelsea they make the process double quick.

Mourinho is not exactly a booby prize, but he is not Guardiola. This is not the vision that has been sold ever since the Portuguese departed acrimoniously after a Champions League match at a half-empty Stamford Bridge. For years, Chelsea strived to cast off his influence.

Now he returns and while he will use the attacking gifts of Oscar, Eden Hazard and Juan Mata because he is no fool, it will be with a controlled, split-team approach - attack with four, defend with six - that characterised his counter-attacking and ultimately one-dimensional Real Madrid. David Luiz is a thrilling player whom Barcelona would seek to build a defence around. Mourinho is willing to sell him, which tells you everything about his aversion to risk.

For Chelsea, this is a retreat to a policy where winning at all costs is all that matters. It is not a bad philosophy, but let's not confuse it with high, romantic ideals.

If it fails, all Abramovich has to do is sack another manager. Easy come, easy go. There is little risk for him.

There is much more at stake for Mourinho, who faces the rock star's unenviable task of following the brilliant, fresh, ground-breaking debut album knowing that he can never capture the same originality.

United represented the far more thrilling challenge but he, too, has paid for his troublesome reputation (and not before time, as countless referees, Unicef, and especially Barcelona will agree).

Consider his record as one of the most successful managers of the age - a coach who twice won the Champions League with underdogs, who perhaps even more than Guardiola comes with the closest thing to a guarantee in such a fickle profession.

Then think that Mourinho, who relished the idea of trumping Sir Alex Ferguson's accomplishments, was overlooked by United in favour of a manager who has never won a significant trophy.

His disbelief at that rejection will be well masked by his many protestations that his heart always was at Chelsea and his family's desire to return to London. But to be second in a beauty parade to David Moyes was not his destiny. He could have shed some of his unpleasant baggage if he had taken a sabbatical but, given the bad blood left at Real Madrid, there are people he must prove wrong. For a man with Mourinho's pathological need to have the last word, that is not a job that can wait till next week.

So he retreats to England, the country that ftes him like no other, to prey on a weakened domestic league. Who would be surprised if he wins the title in his first season? There is vulnerability among Chelsea's main rivals, with Arsenal becalmed and the two Manchester clubs embarking on new regimes. Mourinho will expect to exploit any signs of weakness.

On the pitch, those battles will be fascinating even as Mourinho teaches a new generation of Chelsea players how to make a cynical foul and to block defenders at corners. Next season's Premier League is already full of intrigue and Mourinho returns with an undeniable ""wow"" factor.

So although the cost of a house itself is high, mortgage payments are very low and so if you can get over the hump of the deposit, buying a house is a relatively affordable exercise (especially when compared to the interest rates of the 80s) right now.

So that's why many people don't pay much heed to the total cost of the home and look at affordability index - the cost of mortgage payments vs monthly wage.

example - mortgage of £120K generates a monthly mortgage payment of £605 approx at 3.5% (typical 2013 rate) - it would be £1000 at 9% (typical for 90s) and £1650 at 16% (i think the peak they were getting to in the 80s/90s). this is why house prices are not in a bubble - they represent a reasonable monthly cost to people.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I agree we need to chase a big name striker but we also can't be to hasty.

Villa ""on the cheap"" would be huge for us, not only is he a class ahead of Ade or JD but he is a player who has literally won every major trophy he has taken part in for club and country.  We are a young team and hard work needs to be rewarded but a guy like Villa can help instill a mentality at the club of what it takes to win at the next level.  No one else on are squad has anything on their list showing they have won anything and the way the league is stacking up we need to have a true mentality that there are no small games.  Villa is a fantastic example of a key veteran who can help instill the mental toughness we need.

Now we do need to make a pull at a big striker i just don't want us throwing £20m after Benteke because he is carrying the hype of a fantatic season in the PL. He is a heck of a player but the pricetags they are throwing around remind me of the Andy Carroll nightmare at Liverpool.  I think Benteke is a much better player than Carroll but he is the perfect example of hype (well, and Liverpool's stupidity) driving up the price.

Consider Benteke (who is a great talent) is being thrown around in the neighborhood of £20m.  Others in the £20m+  neighborhood that are rumored to be moving around Stevan Jovetic, Mario Gomez, Soldado,Christian Benitez. Not saying Benteke isn't a huge talent but at £20m+ i would love to take a look at some of the others out there.

If we could land Villa, and then grab either a £20m level striker i would be ecstatic.  Then again if we could grab Villa plus a £12m-15m striker (Bony, PEA, Leandro fucking Damiao) and put that extra cast towards a player like Bernard, Etienne Capoue, Paulinho, Claise, Eriksen well i think i would be just as happy if not happier.

We have a fantastic base for a team to make a charge at the top, let be smart and make sure we can get the most bang for our buck.

And lets face it......if AVB wants any one of these player more than the other, i am going to trust his instincts more than my own.

His writings contrast well with both our western modern treatment of the 2nd and third worlds (everywhere that is not Western Europe or North America) AND with the activities of the Romans.

Once you get in to Ho Chi Minh, you start to see the Cold War as Western Imperialism vs Good Communism (and WW2 as well as Western capitalist Imperialism vs humanity), which he correctly predicts from about 1926 I think).  Korea, Vietnam, Cuba etc really were literally just America trying to control shit.  Later on Communism flops as it turns into a badly run central dictatorship but in the early days it really was a force for enormous good and America feared it as that and killed a lot of people to try and prevent humans being free.  At the end we in the west were the lesser of 2 evils compared to the USSR.

Really, our current ""leaders"" are more like play actors compared to those that went before them, and the whole thing is cyclical:  In the end it's all just a function of economics and people being short sighted, untrustworthy, greedy and lazy.  Sometimes things get really bad and a generation says ""No, that is enough"" like after WW2.  But then the next lot are greedy as fuck and we get back to business.

I guess for every sentient species it would be a similar combo with similar outcomes, but it does make you wonder about re-incarnation and whether we will ever be free of all this.  My biggest worry is not the economy (boom will follow bust) or (nuclear) war or global warming.  My worry is that we have stopped progressing as a species.  We mastered agriculture a while ago and that lead to us being the dominant species on earth.  And since then we have had little spurts of achievement before lapsing back.  Right now we are lapsing back in space exploration and pure science and culture and art.  In 1000 years will someone else be making the same comment or will Humanity finally outgrow this shit?  I fear we will weather storms and then get back to being selfish and boring.

Sorry, you're trying to challenge the way UK law has been handled for the past *800 years?*

The reason it's not precisely defined is for the example you gave:

&gt; I do indicate - but do you know what? - if I'm on a dual carriageway and the next car behind me is a dot on the horizon then I probably won't indicate nearly as long because it would be pointless.

It's variable. If you're travelling at 70mph down the M1, you're going to indicate for a turn off much, much earlier than if you're doing 20 through a quiet estate in North Yorkshire. 

You can't say ""You MUST in every circumstance indicate 300yds before your turn."" Because 300yds at 70mph is nothing, 300yds at 5mph is way too much. 

As you also pointed out, traffic density also effects when you indicate, no one around? Approach the corner and when you start to break, knock your indicator on. Lots of fast moving traffic on the M6? Indicate early so everyone is aware of your intentions.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; As you also pointed out, traffic density also effects when you indicate, no one around? Approach the corner and when you start to break, knock your indicator on. Lots of fast moving traffic on the M6? Indicate early so everyone is aware of your intentions.

Let's say you do this but the cyclist following in your blind spot isn't paying attention and hits you as you take the turn. Who is at fault then? You *did* indicate but not for long... the cyclist was following too close to take action when you did indicate and turn. If you'd carried on straight you'd be fine - if the cyclist had kept a greater distance then they would have been fine - but let's face it in built up areas it's common to bikes to keep pace with cars at low speeds. 

The point being there's *always* a possibility of some unforeseen event that could cause an accident. 9 times out of 10 it's fine - but the tenth time someone gets hurt. 

People are not always predictable. 

I agree that leaving 300 yards at 70mph vs. 10mph when slowing to take a turn is a huge difference - but if there are going to be laws on this there really ought to be more of a guideline than ""reasonable space"" - because everyone's idea of reasonable space is different (obviously, because a great many people don't bother to indicate at all - and they're in the wrong). 

What I'd look to avoid is the instances of cars changing lanes on a motorway in moderate traffic and giving some signal to their mind - but not enough to that of the cop that's following. It *could* be abused if it's not nailed down. 

Or if not - then why do we have speed limits and that margin of error that's clearly defined as a percentage? Why not just say ""use your common sense"" as we apparently are here? ",0,1370428493,null,0,false,0,cack4mo,t3_1fpi0x,t1_cack4mo,t1_cack1tm,null,1430919564,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In both real and absolute terms, there has been a massive pay cut. I suspect the reason I can't find a source is that each type of fee was subject to a different cut and there is no single figure available. 

How barristers are paid is that each part of a case is paid a fixed fee dependent on the type of hearing and its complexity. You can get any legal representation you request and the incentive is to pick the best person available. However, because more complex and higher profile cases pay more, the top barristers choose these over the simpler cases. That is why new barristers might work on thefts, but the top people might work on murder or terrorism. It is a wholly meritocratic system. The new system removes that and simply provides you with a lawyer whose company put in the lowest bid.

&gt;Bovine tuberculosis is a serious problem for UK farmers, deserving the highest standard of evidence-based management. The government's TB-control policy for England includes licensing farmers to cull badgers. As scientists with expertise in managing wildlife and wildlife diseases, we believe the complexities of TB transmission mean that licensed culling risks increasing cattle TB rather than reducing it.
&gt;Even if such increases do not materialise, the government predicts only limited benefits, insufficient to offset the costs for either farmers or taxpayers. Unfortunately, the imminent pilot culls are too small and too short term to measure the impacts of licensed culling on cattle TB before a wider roll-out of the approach. The necessarily stringent licensing conditions mean that many TB-affected areas of England will remain ineligible for such culling. We are concerned that badger culling risks becoming a costly distraction from nationwide TB control.
&gt;We recognise the importance of eradicating bovine TB and agree that this will require tackling the disease in badgers. Unfortunately, culling badgers as planned is very unlikely to contribute to TB eradication. We therefore urge the government to reconsider its strategy.

Stalin took Russia from a backward nation on the verge of starvation to a world super power and he defeated the Nazis on the way (let's face, it the war was over before we ever landed in France, the turning point was Stalingrad).  There were purges on the way and more than a little famine but they were inevitable.  The outlook from 1950 was an unstoppable red army, un matched economic success inside the Soviet block, skyrocketing standards of living.  Stalins big mistakes were the purges and the famines.  Later communist leaders did not repeat those mistakes.

That is why the US feared Communism more than the USSR:  It worked.  It was popular, it got results, it lifted peasants and slaves to make them citizens.  Capitalism could not match either the popular appeal or the results.

Let's face it:  for most backward nations communism worked and it still does.  Compare Cuba with other Caribbean nations, Haiti, Dominican Republic etc, which have the better standards of living?  The same applied in SE asia in Ho Chi Minhs day:  Would you rather be a colonial surf living under French occupation?  Definitely not.  The same themes that Ho Chi Minh goes over and over in the 1920 to 60s are in play in Africa today, the exact same problems are now labeled ""Globalisation"" when before they were called ""Capitalism"".  What we did with Armies in the 1900s we do with banks and ""free trade"" agreements in the 2000s.

I want to be clear:  Stalin was not Good.  He was not Nice.  He was a murderer.  But he was also the best thing ever to happen to the Russian people.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"This is a wider problem than just the UK, but it is a serious issue in our higher education system.

I'd say somewhere around 1/3 of University students are being scammed.

I don't mean there is illegal activity going on, I mean their degree is worth less than the amount they are paying for it, when you take into account what they could be doing during the time they are at university.

I did Engineering, and regularly joked with my girlfriend that her and her two friends were funding my 3rd year project (it cost the university over £10,000 a year in software licencing), except it's true.

A University has 3 main costs of a humanities degree:

* Cost of the space to host lectures and seminars - These aren't even used very often in the low number of contact hours humanities often have, not to mention they are used by all departments, I shared some classrooms with Management, Geography, Geology, Physics, Chemistry etc.

* Library and IT resources - Again, used by all students, and most students have their own laptops and internet access, especially important in an essay-writing course.

* Professors and staff - You'd think all that money saved would go to hiring the best of the best? Nope, many humanities professors are either incompetent, lazy, don't care, trying to sell overpriced textbooks (which they demand you quote), trying to get published. Not all are so indifferent about the students, but when you pay that much for fees, you should have the best of the best.

My graduation was around 40 Engineering students over all disciplines, from Mechanical Engineering to Embedded Systems.

There were over 400 History students.

I had 23 intense (by that I mean use of resources) contact hours average per week for my entire degree, History students had around 6 which were just lectures or seminars in a classroom.

It is embarrassing how much humanities students are taken advantage of, convinced that they should ""pursue their passions"" when really they are being taken for a ride by the Universities.

Someone really needs to start telling kids at an early age that 1. Not all degrees are made equal, some ARE more valuable than others. 2. You don't need a degree, there are other, far more useful ways to get relevant qualifications.

If we could wind the clock back and make the Sinclair C5 catch on and then build a road network around urban areas to accommodate them, we would solve rush hour. But before that, Scotland will win the world cup, Switzerland will declare war, and I will shit a shooting star.

We've lost Haebus Corpus, we've lost the right to a fair trial (through the changes to legal aid), any of us can be arrested and held indefinitely on suspicion of thinking something bad about the state, etc.

The fact of the matter is this - we are not very free at all. Rights that were fought for, centuries of progress have been wiped out by knee jerk reactions to a few terrorist acts. 

Worse there's the ingrained lack of freedom: the existence of a ""political class"" is an anathema. I am disgusted by the very idea of a career politician. What the fuck do you know about life if you've gone from Eaton -&gt; Oxbridge -&gt; Party Researcher Post -&gt; MP -&gt; Front Bench? Fuck all. That's what. Issues like poverty are abstract concepts to a lot of these people; poor people are ""others"", and it's easy to dehumanise them from this perspective.

That was a bit of a side rant, but my point is that there still exists the ""Old Boy's Club"", and it's still the fast track to power. 

But the political system also has issues built into it, Gerrymandering is still perfectly legal in the UK, and constituencies are changed virtually every election to maximise the seats for the party in power. That's a major, *major* issue as far as I'm concerned and *nobody* brings it up. 

**Global Warming:**

This is one of the major issues facing mankind that we can't escape and it's going to take serious, combined effort to tackle. If we don't, entire nations will disappear, thousands of acres of farmland will become arid, we will be utterly fucked by the planet. 

And nobody does one god damn thing about it. Sadly big issues like this are one of the ways in which authoritarian governments have an advantage over democratic ones. Huge, unpopular changes are needed, and no democratic government wants to look beyond it's own elected period of office (and if they did the next government might repeal their changes anyway). 

But it also faces the second obstacle of Capitalism. We are going to need to give up market efficiency for reductions in Greenhouse gasses. We need to change over energy generation to a combination of nuclear and renewable sources. Renewable sources however are simply not competitive forms of power generation. They're expensive and need hefty subsidies. Additionally we're going to need to stop flying shit all over the place and deal with longer shipping times. We might even have to go back to wind power (or wind assisted) power for freighters.

As fate would have it, Dearborn has a huge Muslim population and Fordson, both the team and the high school, are represented in the same way.

It was an interesting documentary, but relevant to what you've just said, all those featured identified themselves not simple as Muslims or Arabic, but Arabic-Americans.  This doesn't necessarily mean there aren't those who take a contrary view, however, it does strike me as something the yanks happen to done a fairly decent job in: their insufferable indoctrination.  All that singing to that flag and ra-ra 'Murica (though the latter is in jest, it has its roots in truth) does seem to breed a certain sense of togetherness that seems to be absent here.  

I mean take myself, sure I'm British, but a large part of me identifies as Jamaican more that English.  During the Olympics, I was supporting Jamaica more than I was Team GB, and when Bolt and Blake won Gold and Silver, the patois tumbled out of every lip of carribean descent within earshot.

I'd bet a large portion of my insignificant income that that didn't happen in the states.  (In fact my relatives in the states, weren't supporting Jamaica at all, the turncoats!).

Now, that's not to say America has got it perfect, because it doesn't.  There was an incident as documented in the film which serves to illustrate just how immature America can be and perhaps still is as a country and a culture, but when they finally click with multiculturalism, it will be a hell of a lot truer that what we've got or likely to have following our current model.  

I think moving forwards Britsih culture will have to ditch a lot of the things that in my mind it currently clings to, and on a more personal level, we as individuals will need to do the same.  British history isn't just White English history, but something of a more global affair.  Except the attrocities of the past and deal with it on both sides.  Apologise for shit and move on.  Accept shit happened and move on.  

I've gone off topic, but yeah, my point is, it's easy to point fingers, but it's quite a complex situation.

I would say that London would probably sort you best. It is a city full of people from all over the world, and it is the most open city in London. Owing to a lot of immigration, typical English people are now getting fed up of foreigners. But, in London this will not really affect you.

I have visited Bucharest, and as such I am aware of how things are in Romania. I would make a suggestion, when you arrive in London be ready &amp; open to make friends with other communities, as I would not be surprised if there will be a lot of gay Romanians coming to London.

I would say that if you speak English well, then get on over here. I have a few Polish &amp; Slovakian gay friends who got work in gay bars to get started, and the through these places of work they made some good friends.

Wishing you the best for your move.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"A bubble doesn't mean that something is unaffordable, it means the price is above a 'natural' level. I could afford Amazon stock in 2004, but it was certainly in a bubble. Everytime the lorry drivers threaten strike, I can afford to fill up my tank even if petrol prices jump 10p a litre. The prices are not reflecting the *fundamental* value but the *perceived* value or speculated future value. Essentially you could say an asset is traded at **(Fundamental Value)x(Market Sentiment)** very simplistically. People pay over the odds for things they 'feel good' about, and below the odds for things they 'feel bad' about.

From wiki:

&gt;An economic bubble (sometimes referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania or a balloon) is ""trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values"".

It's not an exact science to calculate the intrinsic value, but a common technique is to look at common factors that historically impact the price of something. For property prices, inevitably this is the profit for landlords (if you can make more profit, you pay more!), and also inflation adjusted income (again, if incomes increase, people can pay more for). As the OECD report shows, we are well above parity on both fronts compared to historical averages, which would indicate to the unemotional investor that perhaps houses are currently trading at above their intrinsic value, driven by market sentiment. A bubble occurs when speculators continue to pile in, driving the price higher and higher, and we become divorced from intrinsic value and instead look at the shorter term gains of 'Well, even if its overvalued, I can get in and get out before it pops and make a profit'.

My complaint was not that a newspaper said something that I didn't want it to say. My point was that this was even news at all. People *are* arrested for saying things.

Electoral reform is a big issue to me. Probably the biggest, and I think that sorting that out is key to sorting out many other problems we have.

Any way, if you want to talk about deep seated problems of the 21st century, we need to look outside of the UK to find those. In the UK, although the rich/poor divide is growing, we still have good education, healthcare, food on our plates, security, etc, etc. We have a reasonable standard. The deep seated problems are mostly in under developed nations, or are world-wide problems like climate change, global poverty.

Finally, I'd like to point out that this thread is for issues which *don't* enter the public discourse all that often. The big problems: debt, economic issues, government accountability, the war in Afghanistan, the struggle to encourage responsible capitalism, privacy, etc, enter the public discourse *all the time*.

I agree some porn is fucked up but provided it is actually legal then there's not much of an argument that doesn't hinge on frantic calls of ""think of the children!"". I have absolutely no problem with there being an opt-in system for parents to use to stop their kids having access to most pornography, on the condition that if it increases costs they are met by the parents not everyone.

The other downside is that if 99% of porn is blocked it's only the obscure fucked up stuff that isn't and kids will find that which is possibly more frightening than them googling ""boobs and other lady parts"" and finding the mild stuff that probably entails.

As for trigonometry, again this all depends on the quality of the teacher. I was taught to see trig and algebra as puzzles and problems to be solved. As a way of thinking I've found it far more useful than memorising times tables.

Then I think you completely misunderstand the job of PM. Any major issue like this should be the concern of the PM. Doesn't mean he will single-handedly implement changes, no he is the head of the government and so he must voice these matters to the public.

&gt; I don't want to give small parties an unfair advantage — I want voting for them to be worthwhile if people actually want to vote for them.

My point is that FPTP is completely inadequate for representing us at this point in time, and my ‘small party’ example was just an example — a small party that *did* represent our views still wouldn't be in with much of a chance.

&gt; Any system that says a popular party cant win an election because its unfair that the parties that lost, did indeed lose isn't a very good model.

Which is not what I said at all. Where on Earth did you get that from?

FPTP is not the best way to represent the views of a nation. Another example: if in *every* constituency, a party got 40% of the vote and that still wasn't enough to win in those constituencies, then that party, which technically got 40% of the vote overall, would get 0 seats. 40% of the nation would not be represented *at all*.

Suarez absolutely dominated the Dutch league (another weak league, but has more pedigree is producing star talent), scoring 35 goals in 33 league games and was Dutch footballer of the year(a more prestigious award than Ukrainian player of the year). He was also coming off a phenomenal World Cup run with Uruguay.

Ronaldo was a highly scouted talent, again from a better league, and had been in the spotlight for a while. United paid £12.24m for him, although most pundits seem to believe he could have been attained for much less (rumored that Sporting was willing to part with him for £6m)

Pepe has been average for at least 3 seasons now. All the stats hint to that. That being said, he improved greatly as the season went on and pulled off some vintage Reina saves. If he continues is second half of season form, he'll be right up there.

As for selling or keeping him, I'd be very wary of replacing keepers. It is one of the most difficult positions in the squad to replace.  You only have to look at the troubles of Arsenal and United to see how hard it is to replace your Number 1. My hope is we get a young keeper as the No. 2 and Pepe stays for another couple of years. He is also a leader in the dressing room and is the loudest voice among the players, especially since Carra has retired. He will be a great influence for the younger players.

But we know he loves Barca and would jump at the chance to play for them. I wouldn't want to grudge him that. He has been a great servant for the club and in my eyes is a proper legend.

Now that a large percentage go to university, anger against university fees and abundance of degrees has morphed into anger against traditional education, with people saying that they only want to learn the skills that will get them into a job. More and more are questioning the point of learning about the upper levels of Maths and English (trigonometry, literary criticism etc.) There is no point in teaching children who don't want to learn. It's wasted labour. 

One thing I should also mention is that I believe children should be allowed to retake years more easily. If someone goes through a trade-oriented school then wants to go to university, they should be able to take the lessons and exams to do so. At the same time, those who are struggling in the year they are in should be held back. I've never understood why children who struggle to read and write are then moved into the next year where they lag further behind.

As for that shit about Mourinho at Man Utd. It seems that was never on the cards. Ferguson wanted Moyes, at no stage would that have involved talking to Jose about the job. 

This guy just can't stand to see Chelsea fans happy. We were a 'disgrace' for not wanting Benitez, now that we have a manager who we will back regardless of results, that's too 'boring' for him? Go fuck yourself.

I studied a social science and knew plenty of people who seemed to not engage with the critical aspects of the material, seemingly as they had attending this top tier uni as a formality prior to entering the jobs market. This instrumental relationship with education is pretty hard to overcome, I think it becomes even harder to overcome when you divide the student population into certain types of schooling at an early age.

You're right to draw on the problem of over-qualification and an dearth of adequate jobs, but frankly I don't think that there is a way for our economy to revert to a trades (by which I'm assuming large scale skilled manual labour, inc. manufacturing) base. The jobs we have in that sector are increasingly mechanised, which requires those who supervise it to have the requisite educational qualifications. Be it a BSc in Computer Science or BEng. 

I was saying about dividing the population in certain forms of schools, I think this is a bad idea as it discourages social mixing and people encountering people different to themselves, with different ideas of what's important and what's valuable. Yes, this can be a cause of confrontation but ultimately a drawn out exposure to difference is helpful to reducing social tensions. By categorising teenagers into certain types of career path that early you run the risk of homogenising groups, as well as making desire to change course all the more overwhelming for those that would take your option or retraining in a different skill set.

The problems that are being faced by universities as they are being directed to run as businesses, rather than places of learning, is an further problem with the system at present. Students are being put in a financial relationship with the institution, meaning it becomes one of a consumer-producer.

""but but randomness!"" Yeah, it's so random he's been a white male, never really short, really tall, every time. I think it's a lot less random than people would like. Fact of the matter is that most people will stay male their entire life, and most will stay female their entire life. Only a handful will change and when they do it's only because they have a gender/sex mismatch. I don't see why Timelords would be much different. We know that they have some level of control over the process, even if it varies from person to person. 

Especially considering, at this point, he's already regenerated 11 times into a white male. So I feel the argument of ""it could happen!"" is a bad one. Clearly the odds don't favor it, so if they do go along with it, it would need a reason, an explanation. If not, then I would always have the feeling it's a gimmick, something to try and boost the ratings. This wouldn't be fair to whoever would play the Doctor. Plus, many people would simply stop watching as they'd feel they've finally jumped the shark. 

And I think people are placing way too much money on the Corsair line. It's a singular person, maybe the Corsair is on the flipside of a coin, identifying as both genders to an extent or otherwise simply identifying differently over time. There is no reason to believe this to be true for other Timelords or the Doctor. 

Furthermore, with the amount of importance placed by fans on that line, I feel the other side can do play the same game and pull an extra clip that basically confirms the Doctor identifies as male. (Series 5 extra, just before Vampires of Venice)

Deferring to you in this case would be no less ignorant than using my own not entirely unreasonable presumptions - certainly not baseless.

I did in fact Google for information looking for the source of Hawaiian sands. I found some which said that Waikiki was sourced from elsewhere (a commonly known fact, but was stopped in the 70s), but that was all. Nothing about the other beaches certainly. I did also find sources claiming that one of the 'sacred' beaches was made from shells, etc, as you said. As for the others, unfortunately black sand beaches are not the majority there so your claims do not appear to hold.

Obviously, if the rest of the beaches were artificially created, there would be resources saying they were... which certainly appears to not be the case. The cost of sand itself is matterless. There is still the processing, logistics and staff costs. Which to a small state government are no doubt not unsubstantial.

The failure of Maastricht has been 20 years in the making, the problem with the Euro was present for 10 years before Greece imploded.  They're still talking about democratic deficits and holding emergency talks for what a single currency needs.  They had literally decades to conduct the most obvious of reforms, yet they never quite seemed to get their act together.

We have a Common Agricultural Policy that is paying for broadcasting rights for bullfighting in Spain, and which buys butter mountains and milk lakes.  They've even been giving away blocks of EU subsidised cheese the size of house bricks.  The parliament regularly up roots and moves to Strasbourg, just because.  Regulations have turned Jurassic Park, breeding 10x as many as what the EEA and the common market alone requires.  That's the size of the Single Market in a pictogram; ten times the regulation of the Common Market.    We are in the 18th successive year in which auditors have not been able to sign off on the Commission's books.  We were asked to celebrate the final reform of the CFP a couple of days ago.  If it arrives (and it's a big if because these promises have never materialised before) then we might, if we stick to a timetable, be able to stop dumping dead fish in the year 2020.  7 years to build up to not dumping dead fish, or for them to change their minds again.  

Britain has been calling for this discussion about what the EU was to become and trying to reform the direction since 1988.  Twenty-five years since the Bruges Speech at the College of Europe.  That is why the UK has opt outs and vetoes which the Federalists and Commission hate.  For 25 years we have been saying we are not going in that direction and if you write it we need aspects to not apply to us.

So my question is this:

**How much more time will they need for reform?**  

How long before we can say we gave it a good shot but we've come to the fork in the road?

These 'reforms', they're not just a few glaring glitches that stand out or naturally occurring defects built up over time.  They're genetic deformities.

I wanted to see if there was anything in the way he set up that made him deserve money for standing on a box and not even staying still!

So he's cutting across Williamson square and through the side streets, zigzagging towards L1. Before he turns onto church Street there's a guy dressed the same as him already on his box. My guy stops for a split second before charging off quicker than before, turns onto church Street and sees another man, dressed the same outside H&amp;M. This time my guy stops in scowls slightly longer before continuing on his way. 

The way the guy I'm following keeps stopping makes me believe these are his spots and people have got there before him, I'd actually never seen so many people doing whatever they think  they're doing like that in town before. But anyway, he carries on and turns the corner by McDonalds to see another guy dressed all in white standing at the side of Zara. I've been watching my guy get more and more agitated by these others, which I'm now assuming have set up an elaborate prank.

Azpi-Cahill-Terry-Cole
--Luiz--Rami/Essien--
Oscar---Mata---Hazard
---Torres/Ba/Lukaku---

I'm not to sure who we're going to sign so I'm going to stick with this for now. Obviously I'd be rotating Iva with Azpi and Cahill as we need to, I also imagine that Lamps would probably replace someone in that midfield considering how highly Mourinho rates him. I've also got Lukaku as the striker as I've heard things about Mourinho saying that he'd be giving him a shot in the first team this season. We've also got the Bison back in the midfield this season which is great news

I think Courtois is pretty much guaranteed to go out on loan (to Madrid again?) and KdB will probably go out on loan too. I don't think anyone else in our youth particularly note-worthy is going out on loan (apart from Chalobah) but correct me if I'm wrong.

For the first time in a while, I feel that we don't need to make big signings in any part of the team. Maybe a few squad players, in particular the pivot role (maybe someone that can transition from defence to attack better than Mikel) and MAYBE a defender (however I believe Essien can cover as a fullback).

I believe that our main goal during the pre-season is to blend the team together and improve as a unit, we have the quality to win the EPL and more, we just need to remain consistent throughout the season and having a few more players that can perform on par with our first XI should definitely help. This part is probably going to be the things that Mou will work on the most.

A vote for OUT will be sold as a trade agreement and access to the Four Freedoms through the UKs separate EEA-EFTA agreement, just as we have now, and negotiated from there.  You will not be arguing from a status quo position.  The OUTs will.  IN will be a vote to finally bend a knee to EU Federalism and the end of a nation.

Remember the property is a business. Its not your home so don't get beat up about it when the tenants live in it in a shit state and don't go overboard when fitting it out and decorating it to rent out. Some tenants are decent, quite a few don't give a shit especially the younger ones and singles.

DO do periodic inspections at least every 6 monthly. 

Personally I wouldn't bother with a letting agent.  Be careful about accepting those on unemployment benefits - check with your insurance company that you are covered for letting to the unemployed because many LL insurers DON'T cover unemployed tenants.

**If you are on a repayment mortgage remember that ONLY THE INTEREST PORTION OF THE PAYMENT is a tax deductible expense.** If your repayment mortgage is £500 a month, £200 of which is the interest, and you charge £500 a month rent you are deemed to have made a £300 profit, not £0, and you will pay tax on that money if your total income exceeds the lower threshold.

And finally, DO NOT RENT TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY. They have a nasty habit of leaning on that relationship when they're a bit short of brass for the rent.

How often do you do the Chester - Manchester route?

There are basically 2 options:

Arriva Trains Wales services take ~1 hour and generally have newer trains with a trolley service. They go Chester - Helsby - Frodsham - Warrington - Manchester Piccadilly.

Northern Rail have older trains, no trolley and take a different route to Manchester Piccadilly (the Mid-Cheshire line via Altrincham and Stockport), the journey takes about 1 hour 30 mins.

If your tickets were marked ""Route: Any Permitted"" you could have used either service. The Northern service doesn't stop at Oxford Road so you would have had to walk back to Piccadilly to get one.

Not much use to you now but it might help for the future.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I have to use brakes because lorries basically spend half their time pulling out about 2m ahead of me.

That is because you look about as far as the end of your bonnet and take no notice of what is going on around you. Had you done you'd notice that lorry closing on the one in front of it. Engaging your brain you'd realise that it is probably going to want to move out into L2. At that point you should be planning a possible move into L3 looking for a space to open up and maybe lifting off the throttle a little.

&gt; Your solution is to read the road? (Generally my strength when driving by the way) 

Apparently not judging by your claim of half the lorries you come across pulling out 6ft in front of you.

&gt; And if you read the fucking point I made, I want to not use my brakes. 

Then learn to read the road ahead better and anticipate what others are going to do and pre-emptively acting instead of REACTING to something as you currently appear to be doing. In my car I can join the M62 at Howden, Junction 37 and get off at Junction 15 having gone through the busiest part of the second busiest motorway stretch in the entire UK and never use my brakes once in that entire 70 mile distance. Hell I even use cruise control for the majority of it and I do the speed limit as much as possible.

Hell I use my brakes so little when driving that once I got told my brake pads were low at a service. I got told they were low at the MOT at a different garage a month later. 12,000 miles later I changed them and they still weren't down to metal. My last car when I bought it had new pads and discs fitted. I did over 75,000 miles in that car and only went through one set of brake pads which were fitted just before I sold it.

You get old, you apply for a pension, they apply the fit-for-work test and if you are too frail to earn your living then ... well there's a problem, old and knackered is a lot about loss of stamina and the test ignores that. 

A lot of old folk manage to live independently but are not fit for work. The test involves ticking boxes for capabilities such as ""Can you walk 200 yards?"" Every-one who can manage to get their own shopping gets ticked off as 100% able to walk (ie no points towards qualifying for benefit) even if they fail every employers' medical as obviously old and knackered because slow and doddery. 

Old and knackered so that the claimant can only manage 10 hours work spread through the week scores no points on the physical descriptors.

There are mental health descriptors. Some-one who restricts what they do due to lack of stamina used to pick up a few points on the mental health tests, but when you check the [current tests](http://www.tameside.gov.uk/esa/wca) you notice that they are calibrated for a limited selection of serious mental illnesses.

When you read about ATOS finding some-one with a heart condition fit for work and they promptly die of it, remember that a heart condition leaves you knackered and old before your time. Employers ask: can this man last from 9am on Monday to 5pm on Friday. The test asks: can this man last from 9am on Monday to 10am on Monday.

true,cypressgroove,eng-sussex,bRightOn,"Thanks, I kinda figured it would look something like that. If I may, I'd like to briefly highlight why all of those stages are in reality more selective than you imply. In fact, why I'd say far from 'everyone' having access to them, a significant proportion of people do not. 

1. Parents. -- This one relies on, well, first and foremost *having* parents. Even if you do, that option is only really available to younger people from established homes with an income, it's considerably less viable amongst those who come from broken and/or abusive homes, people a little older whose parents have died or even from families who *simply can't afford to home their adult kids*. A problem you can expect to see more of with recent changes to the benefits rules. 

2. Family. -- See (1).

3. Friends. -- This is only an option if you have friends that a) can afford to let you stay with them b) want to let you stay with them and c) aren't already sick of your broke ass asking for favours. Also worth noting that someone 'staying with friends' *doesn't have a home, and is thus still 'homeless'*.

4. Care system. -- Sounds good for the young, mentally ill or otherwise 'vulnerable'. Unfortunately they're the minority so this one again doesn't apply to most people.

5. Benefits. -- This one's a classic. In fairness you're right if you happen to be a guy OVER 35 or a parent or whatever. At that point you qualify for a 'home' - until then under the changes to LHA and HB you qualify for a 'room in someone else's home' - and not just that, one that costs no more than 30% of the going market rate for a room in your area. Of course, good luck getting someone to think your otherwise-homeless ass makes their best option for a lodger when there's ten other working people who are all going for the same room and can probably offer far more to the household and afford to dress much nicer etc. So yeah - you're kinda right in that the option is theoretically there, but only for a select group of people now. Even if you *do* fall into the 'chosen demographics' you still need to find rent in advance and deposits from somewhere, no mean feat if you ever find yourself truly out on your arse starting from nothing. (There are some schemes some places that can help with this, as well as the *possibility* of a 'discretionary housing payment' for help with the rent in advance - but councils don't have the money to help everyone and so it tends to be of the 'discrete' side of 'discretionary'). In short - this *used* to be the true option people would choose to 'reject' to become homeless and definitely the option of yours I would give most credence to - but the **reality** in modern Britain is it's **not** available to everyone any more, even if they want it.

6. Hostels. -- *If* you can find lodgings in a hostel that costs less than the room rate you'd get under LHA/HB then, yes, you can stay in one. However, I stress once more, people living in hostels **don't have a home** and are therefore still 'homeless'. That they're not in a cardboard box is some comfort of course, but it's not the same as having a home, not by a long chalk.

7. Charities. -- Sounds good this one, but again - they're discretionary, they have too many people to help and not enough money. So they also tend to only offer help if you tick the right boxes for their given cause, and even then they prioritise. So that's another one absolutely not available to everyone.

8. Local/Central Government initiatives. -- Do you mean ones *separate* from 'benefits'? Because I'm pretty sure most people who describe benefits as local/central government initiatives. In which case I already covered them...

9. Rehab. -- Yeah, rehab ain't much use if you're not an addict, and even then it's rarely free or remotely affordable to the sort of people who end up homeless - hotels are cheaper.


Now, I didn't go through that list in some attempt to put you down or make you look bad, because I think you've got the same impression about the options available to people as most who only hear about them from secondary sources. When you actually spend some time with homeless people and try to go through the options available to them you find that the reality is a tiny tiny tiny number of people 'choose' to be without a home - it's right on the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs after all - instead most are there because they don't check the right boxes to be considered 'worthy' of this government's help. 

Now, it could be argued that's a reflection of the attitude of the populace who elected them, but that would an argument I'm not sure I want to get in to right now. 

I'm instead trying to gently point out that I think you might have unknowingly internalised a little bit of the 'just world fallacy' believing that people with less have less because they are bad people or must have made bad choices, when far more often, it's simply they are gimped by trying to play the game of life with the crappy cards this constantly 'unjust world' has dealt them.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;*The fact that there hasn't been any real reform is because nobody has wanted to take the risky task of doing it.* 

You just made that up.  Completely out of nowhere.  

There are endless talks and committees on reform.  The EU is synonymous for it.  There are tens of thousands of lobbyists.  Reform is constantly being talked about.   There are over 3,000 specialist European commission committees and advisory groups.  Not wanting to take the risk?  These are the people that tried to force through a Constitution and when it failed rewrote it into an unreadable enabling bill and made MEPs vote on it without giving them time to actually make sense of it.  One thing these people do not lack is political will to make changes however unpopular.  Far from it being a risky endeavour most people would love to see reform.  It's special interests that's stopping it.

They just never get to do any meaningful reform.  They're the King Midas of Bureaucracy.  Everything they touch...

&gt;*You're going to need to cite a source on that. However, it should be noted that we do get a rebate from the EU as the CAP doesn't benefit us as much as it does the other parts of the EU.*

The one that Tony Blair all but gave away?  

Anyway, it was a Spanish report.  With Spanish MPs and MEPs citing it.   Happy to oblige, which I'm sure is more than could be said for the bullocks.

              ""A report by Spanish MP Alfred Bosch said that funds 
               from 'pillar one' of the CAP had been used to for the 
               specific purpose of supporting bullfighting in his 
               country.

               This went, he said, to promoting fights, paying TV 
               rights to broadcast the shows and other costs.

               Spain accounts for about 13.5 per cent of the CAP 
               and, while subsidies have been in slight decline, 
               in 2010 it still received €5.16m.""

http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/greens-claim-cap-funds-are-used-to-support-bullfighting-in-spain/#.Ua9elkBxSSp

[Probably not his best picture, but the report is called 'Toros &amp; Taxes'.](http://delmialvarez.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Report-to-Cut-Bull-Fighting-Subsidies-in-Spain/G0000V27Z5RsD9Ww/I00004aoEFBDNo8A)

&gt;*I believe that this is due to capacity problems.*

Rot.  There is no problem with capacity either at Brussels or Strasbourg.   It's because they're legally bound to hold 12 sessions a year, for around 4 days each.  Essentially, for one working week each month, they pack everything up and head down the road.  Strasbourg and the CAP serve as Promotheus styled examples, lashed to a rock, having its liver pecked out, against those that would argue proper reform possible.  [A majority of MEPs support reform.  Everybody talks about it.  Everybody knows the lunacy and the cost.  The hours lost.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20096221)  If they can't stop the monthly Strasbourg peregrination then they're not fit for purpose; and abandon all hope those that would see common sense reform introduced.



&gt;*Isn't the idea that we have a special veto a euromyth?*    

Depends what you call special.  Does the UK have certain veto powers?  Yes.  The UK asked/stipulated it as a condition to allow the EU party to move on.  Other countries also have veto powers.   They are under threat.

             “The veto right in the EU Council has to be scrapped.”

That's Viviane Reding,  vice-president of the European Commission.  You'll have to Google the sentence because Reddit *really* doesn't like 'Daily Erpexss' links.

She's another Federalist that wants to bring Europeans together [by stealing their governments and parliaments](http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/pdf/eufuture_en.pdf).  

&gt;*Followed promptly by finding out that shooting their Grand National winning horse was economic suicide.*   

Who said anything about shooting trade or trade agreements.  People don't shoot horses for the hell of it.  It's because they're already knackered!    

Decade on decade the EU has lost its share of global GDP whilst the US has maintained theirs among the emerging economies.  The EZ is contracting whilst the Commonwealth is growing at 8%.  Little New Zealand has just announced that it is having trade talks with India on their own, Iceland is in the final stages with trade talks with China, and Switzerland has a free trade deal with Canada.  Meanwhile the UK is left waiting whilst the EU plays catchup and loses evermore ground.

-------------------

But you forgot to answer my one straightforward question:   

**How much more time will they need for reform?**   

Just give me an idea.  Another term?  Two terms, so a full decade?   If the major reforms we've been waiting on still haven't appeared, can we agree on a line in the sand and a time to switch off the life support?   What do you need/want?   There is no way the UK is going to pass even more power to the EU, which by law now has to go through a referendum, and they clearly want it.  So it's only fair for everybody to establish some sort of final window for reform.

A few examples (Not just from me):

- I'd need different insurance, as mine explicitly does not cover unemployed people on benefits and LHA. 

- Can't afford a hoover?  So when they moved out the carpets were beyond even a professional steam clean.

-  Can't afford a professional clean upon exiting the property and then give you months of shit when you try and make a claim against the deposit.  Months and months and months of shit.

-  Point blank refuse to treat the home as their own and complain every few months about the mould growing in their bathroom.  Try cleaning it ass holes.

- They act so bloody entitled half the time.  You block a toilet with your own shit?  Buy a plunger and do it yourself.  Why the fuck am I coming around and plungering your shit?  The same goes for washing machine/tumble dryer/dish washer filters and everything else that needs ""light maintenance"".

- Pay your last utility bills for fucks sake!  I swear this pisses me off so much and is so frequent with those on benefits.

-  Whilst we're on utilities. Cancel your god damn utilities when you move out!!!!  This is a nightmare!  ""Hi Virgin, I'd like Virgin services in my house""...""Um nope, the account in that property is still active with an active landline, oh and it's in arrears""... ""Well I'm a different person, can't you cancel it?""...""Nope!""...

- Have a problem?  The council are useless.

- People without money get very passionate about money even when it's their fault.  For example a tenant who breaks something will normally just buy a replacement themselves (It's not like I have priceless antiques so any replacement will do).  Why the fuck do I have to sit through comments like ""I was shit anyway"", ""I never used it"", ""What?  I have seen one in a charity shoop for £5"".  And when I say passionate, I sometimes mean violent.

You don't get any of this with professional couples because they're busy people who treat the house like their own home.  They respect it and their time is too valuable to spend all day bitching and moaning about how entitled they are.  They can go to the £1 shop and buy a mould spray for the bathroom, as spending hours emailing me to bitch is a waste of their own time.  They cancel stuff, they pay utilities, they don't want bad credit or bad references.  They are awesome.

true,strolls,null,null,"Bristol Council found that ethnic minorities were underrepresented amongst their employees.

Any statistician will tell you that, if you employ 1000+ people, this is not a coincidence - it must somehow be correlated to their race.

Factors for this discrepancy might be racism in the hiring process, that ethnic minorities are disadvantaged educationally and so didn't apply, cultural or just something else.

It might not be Bristol Council's fault that ethnic minorities were underrepresented amongst their employees, but they recognised that 
[people from ethnic minorities are twice as likely to live in low-income households as white people are](http://www.poverty.org.uk/06/index.shtml).

Consequently the council wanted to address the underrepresentation within their workforce, and opened two trainee positions which were offered only to members of ethnic minorities.

[There is a specific exemption in section 37 of the Race Relations Act 1976 to allow this. The council employs over 9000 people, and only offered 2 jobs on these terms.](http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Bristol-City-Council-accused-racist-advert-management-trainee-job-vacancy/story-11290611-detail/story.html)

This kind of ""affirmative action"" is a very blunt instrument, but UKIP criticise it without offering better solutions to this kind of underrepresentation. 

UKIP describe this as [""political correctness gone mad""](http://web.archive.org/web/20100613003911/http://ukip.org/content/latest-news/1663-ethnic-minorities-only-for-bristol-council-job) [MIRROR OF UKIP SITE] because they don't understand or care about social mobility.

I cannot stress enough how important social mobility is - all three of the other main parties recognise this (or claim to), and what they fundamentally disagree on is how to increase it.

To anyone who spends a great deal of time thinking about or studying issues of race and equality, it is UKIP's ""racism against white people"" stance that is (your words) ""rhetoric without substance"".

If the council had a fair proportion of ethnic minorities working there, they wouldn't be offering these two minority trainee jobs. 

I happen to be familiar with this example of UKIP's position. I link to the wayback machine because I couldn't access the page right now - it was certainly an active page on their site only a couple of months ago. 

ICBA going looking for any more race-related UKIP articles, especially as their site's search sucks.

[This article](http://leamington.ukip.org/articles/1875-a-thoughtful-article-from-ed-west-of-the-daily-telegraph) currently on their site shows a woeful misunderstanding of ""political correctness"" - telling ""paki jokes"" is not merely ""rude"" or ""boorish"", it's racially-aggravated harassment, it's divisive and it's harmful. ""Political correctness"" is a core UKIP talking point, and they apply it to things they just don't understand.

This is not really that important, because all UKIP's other policies are daft. Their climate change denialism (or ""effectively"", if you prefer) is unconscionable in the face of the evidence and for a party that claims to consider Britain a ""world leader"". They basically say ""well, China pollutes, so we should stop worrying about our carbon emissions"" - a simple analogy is shitting in the stream because your neighbour does. The [tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) is well-understood, and the only way to get developing countries to stop polluting is to have the moral high ground.

You've only been away a year -- over that time frame immigration has fallen.

&gt; Have there been any official news reports I've missed about the amount of illegal immigration over the last year or is it as it ever was?

Not sure what you have missed, but it has been a HUGE topic in recent months, especially during the run up to recent elections.

&gt; Is there anywhere I can look upon official documents about estimated numbers of benefit cheats or anything in this country, because I am genuinely worried.

EDIT: I can't believe I'm going to defend him, but here it goes. After the debacle last summer, his deleted tweets, his arrogant personality, etc., I unfollowed him. Sometime around November or December, I kept seeing his name pop up and him being linked to claiming more of his ITK stuff. Anyways, things started to actually happen, so during the January window, because it couldn't hurt to at least see what he was saying, I re-followed him. Since then, he's been calling numerous things right.  **It doesn't matter to me whether or not he's actually in the know, whether he has contacts at LFC, or in the media. You're right, he probably doesn't, and he probably is full of shit. But he's been reporting news days, if not weeks, ahead of them. In a few cases, months. And since he's breaking the news first, thats good enough for me.** However, I, as well as everyone else, **should take everything he says with a massive grain of salt.**

Also, he has something like 20k followers on twitter now, at least double, if not more, than he had last summer. There are far too many people following him now for him to delete tweets and pretend they didn't happen, too many would call him out on it. Maybe he's a lot more careful now as well. Regardless, 20k people follow him now. Surely you have to understand that he wouldn't have gotten this far so fast had he been a consistent proven liar (barring last summer). 

If you don't believe me, just give him a follow. Its not like it could hurt. Just take everything he says with a massive grain of salt.

I'm actually not advocating the prefixed-nationality for us.

However, as an aid for a mix of cultures under one banner, I think it's worked quite well for the States.  With them all identifying as prefix-American and their insidious indoctrination, on some level, they all recognise they're in line for a slice of that American pie in a way that I personally feel is missing from here.  Unfortunately, I cannot offer anything approaching academic data to support my feeling - has there actually been some work which focuses upon the percentage of people who identify themselves as British (in England) as opposed to their land of their ethnicity?

In anycase, I'm going to be patronising and spout downvoteable conjecture here (sorry, Yanks), but I suspect the youthfulness of their nation is why we've not yet seen an American effort to ditch the prefix-Americanism.  I have hope they'll do it anyway, because you know, you can't be a nation of immigrants forever and it's annoying to listen to.

If you have an economy where 90% of the people can't buy basic goods then you don't have a rich economy you have a fucking riot.

You sell things for what people can afford. Relative wealth is low. It looks expensive to an outside but that doesn't mean that we're rich. Things may be twice as expensive than in the US but our average salaries are also twice as high so it ends up evening out. We don't have income tax so the government taxes the shit out of imported goods.

For example. In Spain I earn 1500 euros a month. I spend 500 on rent, 200€ on groceries, and 100€ on utilities. I can go on holiday to Ibiza for 200€ (hotel incl.)

In Bermuda my brother earns BM$ 10,000 a month. He spends BM$ 5000 on rent, BM$ 1000 on groceries, and BM$ 1000 on utilities. He has BM$ 3000 to spend on holiday (it will cost him over BM$1000 to leave the island). Does he really have *that* much more money than me?

That is not recipe for good writing however. Star Trek is good because of the plot, and same goes for Doctor Who. We've already got a progressive Doctor, and he is clearly what you could call a ""gay ally"" - he promotes tolerance of all sorts in fact. Bending his gender does not make him more tolerant.

When Kirk kissed Uhura on Star Trek, it was proof that love transcends politics. The characters were not changing, they were showing us who they really are. I don't think the genderbent Doctor is his true form or a new way to tell us what the title of ""Doctor"" means.

If the Doctor regenerates into a woman, his current love interests might not be too happy about it, nor will he find it easy to transition into. All of this presumes it's forced, not a choice because - if you can change gender, but not hair colour, aren't you losing out on the ginger?

Frankly, feel free to add as many Time Ladies as you want to the show. But to claim the species is hermaphrodite or genderbending on a random basis, introduces so many problems to their universe it ain't worth solving. And with the exception of Gaiman's episode, I don't see precedence for it in the show. 

That being said, I'm sure a highly advanced society like that COULD change sex if they wanted to with surgery, just as we do - but regenerations would not force that change onto them. That's just ... well, it's not like it makes sense. Those species on earth which do change gender do so in order to procreate. Nothing suggests they had that problem on Gallifrey.

It's an interesting formation, and one that Mourinho used at Porto and sometimes Chelsea. He also used a very similar layout at Inter (it was described as a 4-3-1-2 there, but the difference is nuanced).

The perks of that formation is it allows you to be very strong in the center of midfield, while still utilizing two strikers. It typically works best with a really great #10 who, freed up by having three other central midfielders, can play a very loosely defined creative role. At Inter, [that player was Sneijder](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/02/24/inter-2-1-chelsea-a-narrow-victory-for-mourinho/), and that season he was considered one of the best in the world.

The downside of the 4-4-2 diamond is that it has no natural width. Typically in this formation the width comes from the outside backs getting forward, which is limited compared to having actual wingers.

The problem I see with playing this formation at Chelsea is that it would be tough to utilize all of our players well. Mata would play #10, his best position, but it would be tough to integrate players like Hazard or Oscar into the formation. The best lineup I can build with this seasons squad is [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=nx5t). There is basically no way to play Hazard and Oscar at the same time.

Basically this formation is great for a team with only one true playmaker. We have like 5 haha. The 4-2-3-1 is a formation that was basically created to maximize the number of playmakers, and that's why we have been using it.

I'm not sure why you think I might say otherwise.

&gt; there are ethnic minorities that are full British citizens that are members of UKIP, and that UKIP's policies support fully

As I explained, the position that UKIP take in [this page from their site](http://web.archive.org/web/20100613003911/http://ukip.org/content/latest-news/1663-ethnic-minorities-only-for-bristol-council-job) is specifically to the disadvantage of British citizens who are of minority ethnicity. 

Did you read that page?

Do you understand what I mean by ""underrepresented in Bristol council's workforce""?

&gt; An article that you claim equates failings of multiculturism to telling ""paki jokes""???? Where? Absolutely nowhere does it say this. What the fuck is wrong with you?

I don't think I did claim that. 

Did you read [this page](http://leamington.ukip.org/articles/1875-a-thoughtful-article-from-ed-west-of-the-daily-telegraph)?

I've highlighted the first reference to ""paki jokes"" in [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/gFcJm0B.png), it's at the foot of the page.

That page on the UKIP site states: ""it’s not 'politically incorrect' to tell a Paki joke, it’s just usually stupid, boorish and rude"". Not only is that wrong, but it demonstrates a woeful misunderstanding of ""political correctness"".

I thought you were asking a genuine question when you asked ""are UKIP really racist?"" and for an explanation of my reply that their policies and positions disproportionately affect people of minority ethnicity. I explained why, so I don't really understand why you're attacking me.

I want there to be a female Doctor and *not one ounce* of that feeling has *anything* to do with ""female inferiority"" or feminist issues.  

I want my Doctor to be complex, always surprise me, and still learn about him/herself/the universe along with the companions.  There is zero reasons why regenerating into a female would stop any of that from happening.


Your argument seems to be that people who want a female doctor want it solely because they want a more feminine influence on  the show - that's simply not true and feels like a straw man argument. 

&gt;Just because he CAN turn into a woman doesn't mean he SHOULD. I feel like if this scenario were swapped and we were talking about a woman turning into a man, it would be out of the question. 

You have given no reasons why the Doctor, for the sake of this character, should not regenerate into a woman.  Why would a female regenerating into a male be out of the question?  [spoiler](#s ""If Melody regenerated into River Song - but Melody was a BOY who regenerated into River song - I think fans would have eaten that up! It would have been a much better surprise/red herring than Amy and Rory having their childhood best friend introduced in one episode also be their daughter/River"") 

&gt;The Doctor's male: deal with it. 

The Doctor is an Alien that regenerates new bodies - one of those bodies can be a female. Deal with it. 

EDIT: When 11th regenerated he checked his hair length and chest to see if he was female.

Your English is decipherable, just, although I understand this may not be your mother tongue. However, you do appear to be missing some fundamentals.

Chelsea's defensive record in the Premier league this season was 3rd best. We conceded less goals than the bloody Champions. It is clear when you look at our Clear Cut conversion chance rate that we have been severely below par at actually scoring tap ins. (Looking at Ba and Torres missing a lot from the 6yrd box). We have the 9th worst clear cut conversion rate this season. This is because of a lack of quality in finishing.

Indeed, it is well known, and rather strange why you can't understand this. Ferguson and Mancini have said than Van Persie made the difference for them this season. They increased their clear cut conversion rate by 2% this season. Mancini said that he was lacking a finisher (although Dzeko was actually more efficient that RVP and should have started more, his inefficient use of the squad quite likely being another reason for his firing)

Defensively, we're fine, and given Mou's tactical tweaks, you could expect us to have the least conceded without any new personel.

true,nunnible,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Okay, I see where things are going wrong.

Firstly. I said ""half there time"" I feel most people would realise this is an exaggeration but maybe this needs to be stated more clearly.

**Point 1**

I am good at anticipating what is happening ahead of me, I am happy to take the word of the people that have seen me driver over someone on the internet who hasn't. I am sure you understand.

(Not that I am perfect at anything mind you, but no one is)

**Point 2**

Sometimes on the road shit happens, even those that are best at anticipating can't anticipate everything. And even if you can anticipate it sometimes you still have to use your brakes.

I just drove about 80 miles, mainly dual carriageways and motorways. The first two examples are from this journey

*Example 1* I was crawling at about 30 in traffic, I had left a large stopping distance ahead of me. The left hand lane was moving at about 5. A van pulled into the gap in front of me, approximately 2 car lengths away. There was a 25mph speed difference so of course I got closer to it, brakes or not. 

Did I anticipate something might pull into that gap? Yes. Could I possibly know which of the vehicles I was going past was going to do this? No.

*Example 2*
Quite a distance in front of me (and as far as I can see in these lanes as the motorway bends at this point) in lane 2 Lorry A ahead is overtaking lorry B. Lorry A pulls in in front of lorry B, lorry B then pulls out to overtake lorry A. I release the accelerator. I was initially driving steadily at a little over 70 (naughty me), by the time I was at 65 I was too close too the lorry and still needed to slow down. 

Should I have realised the vehichle that had just been overtaken was going to immediately overtake its overtaker?

*Example 3*
A car doesn't like being overtaken and pulls out in front of you. Rare but it happens.

*Conclusion*

Planning helps, there is no doubt, but it is not a cure all, to believe you have, or even can plan for everything is both arrogant and dangerous. You to maintain a contingency.

Have you never had to brake because someone has pulled out in front of you?

**Point 3** 

I am all for prosecuting all these things, however i do think that if you are going to have on the spot fines (effectively making the policeman Judge, Jury and Executioner) then it has to be a ""binary"" issue (you are either using a phone or you are not) rather one that can be far more a judgement call (is it going to be anything less than 96m gap at 70mph, if not at what point is it tailgating rather than just being a bit too close?)

**Point 4**

Lorrys pull out into gaps they shouldn't. When I did my driving lessons we were taught something called mirror, signal, manoeuvre. This meant that if someone was in your mirror you didn't signal, let alone manoeuvre)",0,1370456835,null,0,1370464919,0,cacsdwm,t3_1fpi0x,t1_cacsdwm,t1_cacnnsw,null,1430915561,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That page states that ""it’s just usually stupid, boorish and rude"" to ""tell a paki joke"". That is wrong.

It is *harassment* to tell a paki joke, and it's divisive and harmful. That is considerably beyond ""stupid, boorish and rude"".

THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!

... In the segment that was quoted, Davies specifically said ""kids will not have a problem with a female Doctor"".  He said ""I think fathers [read: parents] will have a problem with it"".

He is saying that the children would have no issues, but that parents would be uncomfortable feeling that they had to describe the change to children.  It's not about the children at all, it's about the parents.  Yes, transphobic parents.

Your rant is mis-targeted.

In some places (such as Australia), you get fined if you don't vote, because it means that the decisions can be made based on a more accurate opinion of the public - like how the census is meant to gain an accurate breakdown of the public. They also have the option to vote for something like 'none of the above', which means that you just have to go and tick that box to avoid a fine. People can still protest by not voting, but they get a fine.  &amp;#12494;( &amp;#94;_&amp;#94;&amp;#12494;)

I feel sorry for much of the Royal family, having the papers pry in to every mundane and casual situation that arises, to blow it into some fiasco. Also that they have no choice but to fulfill the constitution, unlike myself, who can become anyone through utilizing what the UK offers.

The Monarch does receives great wealth purely my being born in the right family. However, this occurs everywhere, is it fair Bill Gate's children should receive more rewards when I (or who ever) have worked harder?

(The Monarchy technically losses a great amount of wealth every year but the way of convention, Her Majesty signs over a lease on land worth millions every year for a stable annual salary.)

I don't think a Constitutional Monarchy is any 'fairer', but I do believe it to be a more preferable system of governance and statehood, than the American or German systems.

I believe having a Monarchy creates an affinity to the state away from the governing of the state. 

For example, i would never fight for my (current) government, their behavior is corruption, their taxes are scandalous , they bailing out of grotesquely wealthy bankers with no comeuppance. I would ask you to behave as an MP and see if the elected governance and legal system is fair.

Conversely I would fight for my Monarchy, for national values, curtsies and pleasantries, something the Westminster doesn't represent.

true,Deanomanc,null,null,"I asked if anyone can make a sound logical argument that UKIP are racist (you've clearly failed to do that by the way, but more on that later), you replied with something that effectively wasn't racist at all.

I then asked for examples, you are right - but there was a misunderstanding here. I wanted examples of racism. You gave examples of your interpretation of how a UKIP blog disagreed with your idea of political correctness. (This is what I meant by ""All of these anti UKIP arguments are so very vague, all rhetoric no substance"" Therefore I still stand by that. 

However, I was under the impression that you believed you had evidence that UKIP are racist, hence our misunderstanding. I now understand you mean something much, much milder, which begs the question of what you thought you would achieve by replying to my post at all?

Anyway, you then go on; ""You then appeared to claim that the article I linked to contained no references to ""paki jokes"", and I demonstrated otherwise"" Actually I thought you were trying to make an argument that UKIP were racist, hence why what I ACTUALLY said was, 

""An article that you claim equates failings of multiculturism to telling ""paki jokes""???? Where?..."" This was a simple misunderstanding. 

So what your argument actually entails (and correct me if I am wrong because your argument is highly subjective and hypothetical) is this:

A UKIP blog that ostracised offensive, racially motivated jokes, didn't quite ostracise  telling offensive, racially motivated jokes to the same degree as u/strolls would. Therefore u/strolls suspects there maybe underlying racism involved. u/strolls also doesn't like the UKIP affiliated author's take on political correctness, this also leads u/strolls to suspect that there maybe some underlying racism.


Your argument falls because of it relies on your personal spin and interpretation on the ideas you put forward, showing it relies on a huge amount of conformation bias. You make an appeal to authority fallacy by arguing that all other parties agree with you, an appeal to consequences fallacy by arguing that UKIP's ideas may lead to the kind of thinking behind racist cartoons (absurd)..... I mean, I could go on.

Really if I am being honest, Gareth...plain and simple....was the most exciting player I had ever seen and he just kept improving and getting more consistent as time passed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"oh god many things, 

**the environment and adjusting to it**

well theres little real argument as to whether its a problem or not, most people seem to agree that it is, but will they change a thing about their lifestyle? nope, people are very [NIMBY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) about it, people pay lip service to it all yet when people are told they are going to have to learn to live with less sustain themselves a bit more and not consume so much they just dont want to hear it and think they will be the exception, people act like we'll be able to keep on living like we have lived if only we make some changes to the law and whatnot, when its just going to have to be way bigger than that.

**overpopulation** 

similar to the last point, there are a lot of people in the uk, i would guess too many for the land here to sustain, much, much too many if we want to sustain people living modern lifestyles, which means we have to import food, from other places with growing populations too, it just cant last yet nobody wants to take any steps to use less and create more because it means they have to change.

**lifestyle**

once again relates to the last point, it seems to me people in the uk are generally quite unhappy next to compareable countries, there's the weather which you cant choose, and there's a lot of things about uk society which just kind of suck, the fact there is absolutely no sense of community, even in my tiny village only the old folks will talk to you at the bus stop or say hello as they pass, folks in the city look at you like you are a wierdo if you say hi in passing them when they are out hillwalking or whatever, and would walk past you in the street if you'd fallen. folks stand by passively while a man cuts another mans head off, even when there is a crowd of hundreds there and as far as they know the guys were only armed with a few knives, to me that was pretty typical im afraid to say, cos hurr durr OMG knives!! the uk's general hoplophobia is pretty annoying. 

people generally are very disconnected with their natural environment, i'd venture to say as a country probably one of, if not the most disconnected in the world, many know absolutely nothing about it, posses no land skills (important in the future i think) and regard it as a fairly obscure hobby. think that being glued to tech and computers all day is just the norm.

people seem to have a bit of a gulf between what they expect and what they can reasonably acheive when it comes to housing (related i'd say to overpopulation making land and housing higher in demand), parents and young people themselves often think that they will somehow just be able to cruise along through education and career and buy a house, have kids and a car like their parents, when realistically hardly any of them will be able to afford one these days. yet a fair amount of people still view living with your parents as something only losers do past the age of about 20.

general striving to have a better everything is pretty tiresome and doesnt lead to happiness also which though again everyone pays lip service to that, they still go along with it.

people also have a pretty class based mentality sometimes, folks are very judgemental and thus scared of being judged for their life, folks will avoid wearing or being associated with people who wear tracksuits and talk in a thick accent because its necessarily scummy to a lot, while others will do the opposite as a badge of pride so they can tell everyone how ""working class"" they are, they will purposefully act ignorant and dumb themselves down, be anti intellectual, even when they are really not that stupid and quite intellectual themselves, they'll live their life as a liar because they want to portray themselves a certain way.

people here are very cynical, sarcastic and scathing too compared to abroad, culturally quite repressive i think.

**employment** 

to me it seems there are a whole lot of jobs which would be as well not existing, it's a service based economy i know and industry etc isnt really viable here, but there are a lot of people doing a lot of jobs which just dont really create anything very useful, superfluous administration, not necessarily a bad thing but the rest of the world is pulling ahead of us while we sit around emailing other emailers to tell them we got an email about how someone emailed a client. try bring it up and people doing those jobs swarm you with how important it is because they dont want to lose their job and/or beleive the hype about it.

also employment is so regulated and formal that even for the least of jobs you have to jump through a load of hoops, want a job as a farm worker? better have current certification in all machinery, workplace safety certification, etc etc. bring that one up and people scream and shout about how in getting rid of any of it you're literally wishing death upon thousands of the oppressed proleteriat (who couldnt get a job partly due to this), you sick capitalist bastard.

**overlegislation**

there are a lot of laws in this country, it sucks, so much so that britain has become a byword abroad for ridiculous laws and authoritarian overprotectiveness, it stops people from enjoying themselves at fun yet slightly risky hobbies, to the point that if someone does something a little out-there people will ask if its legal and if there isnt some law that can make them stop, or will make a complaint to the police who will come and bother you until you go away or maybe charge you for breach of the peace or whatever, when you didnt actually break any laws. sometimes makes it feel like the only thing you're really meant to do is work, watch tv and go to the pub.

Tevez and Aguero can both comfortably drop back to pull defenders with them and put a calm pass in to someone looking to exploit the space - if the space doesn't present itself then we carry on until it does.

Dzeko has good movement in the box which makes him good at finding that space, and when he has the space in the box you'd have to bet on him putting it away.  If the space doesn't present itself (and he hasn't already been caught offside) then he'll usually either put in a terrible pass and lose possession, or he'll shoot anyway and more than likely sky it.

What are these vital goals he scored later in the season? I don't remember them. He scored 1 goal, a single, solitary PL goal since Christmas, and that was a last minute goal in a game we were already up in. I think you are looking at this with rose tinted specs or are confusing Jelevic with MaryEllis. 

What makes you doubt we will see that sort of form again? He has done nothing in 6 months to even indicate any way of getting out of it- Phil Jags admitted it himself: he is used to playing against poor defenders, and the guys he comes up against in the PL now have him worked out, get tight to him, don't show him a sight at goal on his stronger foot and all he will do is fall over in an unconvincing attempt to pick up a free kick or penalty.

That having been said, it's nice to be a supporter of a club in the US that isn't Arsenal, Man U, or Chelsea.

In my town, those are the only six clubs that have an organized support, and the United fans aren't even organized--there's just so many of them that you can guarantee a bunch of them will be at a bar in the AM when United has a match.

Some people accuse of me picking a club that is underdog, but not too underdog (see also, non-Boston Boston Red Sox fans, especially a few years ago).  Which I suppose is valid.  But I didn't pick 'em so much as going week in and week out to see the same squad again and again grew on me.

There is no problem with the benefits system, there is a minute, minute percentage of people who claim fraudulently, which is estimated to cost £1 billion per year, an almighty 0.63% of the bill.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;The reason this works against them is because if you have seen Gareth's goals, you'll realize that they aren't very often team goals, but rather Bale doing something spectacular on his own. That's a testament to his personal performance and not necessarily the teams.

Bale was absent for 3 games in December. Spurs lost 2-1 to Everton (2 goals in 88 seconds extra time after leading), defeated Swansea (Vertonghen scored) and drew with Stoke. He also missed the second game against Everton due to an ankle injury, the score was 2-2 (Ade and Siggy). So W, D, D and L (with the L so damn close to a W) are not terrible results. 4 goals scored over the 4 games. 

He is without a doubt the key player, but Spurs didn't do terribly when he was absent. In fact, he had a quiet first half of the season and Defoe was the one belting them in. At one stage Dembele was said to be carrying the team (no losses with him in the lineup until January and Sandro injury).

Many teams have a key player. RVP, Suarez, Falcao, Mata etc. 

&gt;Next, I feel as though they really had to grind out some of their results rather then comfortably claim a win by the 60th minute.

This is the mark of winners. Not losers. Spurs could NEVER grind out a win in the past. Remember at the start of the season when spurs couldn't stop conceding in the last 15 mins? We know our strike force is currently lacking, that is obvious, but the ability to still churn out wins (regardless of how ugly) without having a powerful offence is in my opinion a good thing.

&gt;What both of those stats mean is that their games could have gone any which way, all the way down to the final whistle.

Football is a close game, at the start of the season spurs threw away games they led. At the end of the season, they were the best at comebacks.

That would be my defence. We all know spurs attack leans on Bale, not as heavily as some may imply. This summer strikers are the target, so this issue will hopefully be addressed. I personally am happy that spurs are now able to ground out a win, Utd just won the title by grinding out wins.",0,1370465236,null,0,false,0,cacvpni,t3_1fqs49,t1_cacvpni,t3_1fqs49,null,1430913922,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

&gt;It looks expensive to an outside but that doesn't mean that we're rich.

Which is a bit of a disconnect. If things cost twice as much as the US (a bit of a sweeping statement for a continent with massive price differences across its territory), then Bermudan goods are expensive to people in the US.

It matters not how relatively expensive this is to the local populace. It purely matters how much it is to a traveller. If things are costing twice as much because of things such as a sizeable affluent population raising prices, or the Government imposing punitive import tariffs, then this effects how attractive the island is as a destination.

To dance around my original point a little... Bermuda is unattractive (to me) due to these prices, yet Hawaii which is much further away and also somewhat isolated has much lower prices (inc flight and hotels) and is therefore more attractive. The reason for these high prices, is like I said, a affluent temporary population, and a Government with a bit of a ill thought tax regime. And like you said, import costs, to an extent.

true,BigHaircutPrime,null,null,"Thanks for actually tackling my argument with quotes. I'm not claiming to be right and I appreciate the debate.

I should not have used the term ""feminist"". My bad. I've been studying on early feminism and it's definitely evolved (for better or worse), so throwing that in there was inappropriate. I regret it. My argument was also really poorly structured and executed. What I was really trying to say is that I think having a female Doctor would do more harm than good. Sure, it would allow fantastic opportunities for the character to evolve, but it would also alienate so many others. Again, I keep thinking of the fact that he's a father, grandfather, son (his mother appears in ""The End of Time"" - this was confirmed a few years ago by the actress portraying her). Also, there are so many romances that it puts the women he loves in this weird position. I would have absolutely nothing against a female Doctor if it weren't for this, and trust me if it were to happen and someone like Helen Miren were to take charge, I'd be incredibly happy, but even Alex Kingston (River Song) was interviewed today and was like, ""yeah... I wouldn't kiss her"". Even she was not too keen on the idea. That's why I mentioned that there wouldn't be a need for a female Doctor due to the diverse cast of really strong female characters. 

You mentioned the regeneration and checking of chest, which is a fantastic observation that I completely ignored. Then again, Matt does freak out when he tests his voice as he yells ""I'm a girl!"" I don't even think the Doctor wants to change gender. As for the ""he's an alien"" argument, even aliens have gender, and I'm nodding back to the fact that he's a parent and has parents. What odd though is that it's not clear whether the Doctor is half human or not. I recently watched the 90's movie (8th Doctor), and it's seen as fact that he's 50% human (I think the Master says he has human eyes or something... it's been a few weeks). So even though he's not human (or may be... confusing as hell), he definitely identifies with that race.

Once again, thanks for responding. As I mentioned before, I am not claiming to be right, and there's nothing to lose by being wrong; my views and knowledge will be widened. ",0,1370466650,null,0,false,0,cacw9hx,t3_1fp0is,t1_cacw9hx,t1_cacrubu,null,1430913663,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

1. Going back to the age thing, it definitely plays a role in the Doctor's identity. Part of the praise that Matt Smith has gotten is from being able to play literally an old man in a young man's body (in some moments, like when he puts on Amy's glasses, you feel that he's over a thousand years old). The trend has been overall to cast younger and younger actors, but I get the feeling that that is going to change next regeneration. It's something I actually want and I feel that it's a right step in a bold new direction.

2. The title definitely asserts a male identity. It doesn't mean that he couldn't switch, but the fact that he identifies with that title speaks volumes.

I think what this whole topic is raising is the question of how regeneration itself works. How much of a say does a Time Lord/Lady have in terms of what changes?

Many people like the Doctor because he breaks down the ""restrictive"" gender barriers because he isn't an inherantley masculine character at all. If he were to be a female it'd change his character because he'd be boring and conform to female gender roles or try to be an over masculine tomboy which would be a 180 of the Doctor's personality, kind of feminine.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Well, it strikes me there are 2 issues... but both are effectively the sole fault of immigration:

* The rate of immigration is simply too high. 200,000 people arriving each year (on the books, and god knows how many off the books) is clearly too many. That is more than the population of a city like Brighton &amp; Hove every single year. Our beleaguered construction industry is not meeting demand due to the rapid influx of people (and our own intrinsic population growth) plus internal economic problems - so it is squeezing the housing sector in particular, but also public services like the NHS. 7 out of every 10 children born in London are to immigrant parents... that costs the NHS money. This widespread statement that migrants are economically beneficial to the tax coffers is not actually that straightforward. Plus I can entirely understand why increasingly marginalised white Britons find that rate of immigration intimidating. Being called a racist for voicing it is also particularly unpleasent - and I'm sure no small part of the reason why UKIP are seeing such sucess at the moment.

* A portion of those people that have come here already have failed to integrate sufficiently into British society and culture. Unlike in the past, where migrants were largely anglophiles looking to move to the UK for cultural reasons, this current set of migrants are largely economic. They are here because they want our money, not because they have any particular interest in British life. As such, they want to retain as much of their own cultural identity as possible -- and that causes social friction. We need to do more on the borders to restrict access to these people, and more should be done to dismantle barriers to integration (like the formation of substantial ethnic-minority ghettos in cities like London, Birmingham etc.) For example having streets full of West-africans, with shops that sell west african food, and cafes were people speak west african languages does little to encourage integration.",0,1370469093,null,0,1370469427,0,cacx64v,t3_1fplh3,t1_cacx64v,t1_cacwhd2,null,1430913236,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"In the UK, the convention is that you stay in the inside lane (leftmost) unless you are overtaking, and you are generally supposed to overtake on an outside lane (to the right of the traffic you are overtaking).  This significantly reduces the chances that you will have an accident when moving to the left, because anybody overtaking you is expected to be on your right.

If you are in the middle lane and passing other cars every few hundred metres, you are doing nothing wrong.  In that situation, it is indeed safer for you to sit there than it is to weave in and out.

But if you are sitting in the middle lane when there is little or no traffic in the inside lane, then you are effectively turning a 3-lane motorway into a 2-lane dual carriageway.  People passing you will not want to overtake on the inside, in case you move to the left (because they know that *you* shouldn't expect people to be overtaking there).  Instead, they will have to move all the way from the inside lane to the outside lane, and back again.  In that situation, you are making the road more dangerous by sitting in the middle lane, and creating congestion.  There may be two people overtaking you at any time, and if you're in the inside lane then they have two lanes to fit in, but if you're in the middle lane they only have one.

Also, even if your speedometer says you are doing 70 mph, somebody else may have you clocked at, say, 68 mph and they will overtake you at their faster '70 mph' speed.  Speedos are also deliberately calibrated to overstate the speed you are travelling, because no car manufacturer wants to be held liable for drivers of their cars breaking the law despite following their speedo correctly.

I'm pretty good with money, I keep a spreadsheet of all my income and outgoings that stretches on a couple of months at all times so I can see when I am truly going to be boned. At the minute it stands at about 1-2 months until I go into negative values - I'm lacking around £50 a month, on a £15 food budget, no car, cheap rent and sacrificing the bigger luxuries (read: cannabis, it's my equivalent to the cider) when I have to.

That said, a good (cheap) curry and the odd eighth when I can justify it are absolutely things I need. So long as I can pay my rent then I can bear to enjoy some little treats to keep me going, life would be absolutely miserable without. I'll deal with the absolute worst when it comes and make a reasonable effort to avoid it in the meantime, and enjoy myself as much as I possibly can given the circumstances.

true,kirstizoe,null,null,"Ok two points here.

One: If you want to talk about intersectionality (Class, Gender, Gay, Race, ect) within the world of Doctor Who I will admit that it is making great strides, but it is HARDLY exceptional. Most of these characthers are one offs, or used as comic relief. For example the charachters of Jenny and Vastra are wonderful, but their sexuality is used not romanticly, but as joke fodder. (ie ""I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife"") Captain Jack is similarly used for his outrageous flirtatiousness which is a trope of the gay community. If you want serious LGBTQ characters, you don't use them as fodder for creating comic relief.  Furthermore, racially, we've had TWO black characters and NO asian/pacific-island characters within the shows seven year run. This is hardly exceptional in terms of racial integration.   Otherwise in terms of class, while we started out with working class ""chav"" Rose and Mickey we've had upper middle class or middle class companions ever since. So no, The intersectionality is not good.

Two: You also discuss the how 'weird' it would be to disrupt the relationships if the Doctor were to change gender. This is wholly ignorant to transgender and bisexual individuals and what they go through on a regular basis. Furthermore, as the Doctor is from the future where he has stated that inter-gender relations have evolved beyond ""traditional gender norms"" This argument isn't just offensive to to the LGBT community today, but speaks to a lack of absorption of the source material that you are writing about. 

In short, there's no reason, other than audience queasiness to not change the gender of the Doctor. While I would not be upset if he was again a man, my point is there shouldn't be a problem in this community if HE were to become SHE based on source material and outdated concepts of gender and sexual relationships. 

You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The first is never get involved in a land war in Asia. The second, and only slightly less well known is this: Never get involved in a battle of wits with a graduate student in Social Work and Women's and Gender Studies when Doctor Who is on the line. I'm not stupid enough to drink your poison.

I recommend seeing And So I Watch You From Afar and avoiding British Sea Power. Also, Nine Inch Nails (take lots of photos and send them to me, preferably of Reznor sweaty please) and Green Day always put on a decent show.

This is one of many reasons people don't get help. You're 'wrong' if you're unhappy so you put on an act and that way no one treats you any different, so you don't feel outcast.
Equally many people thinks it's 'just who i am' and that it isn't a medical condition and that they'll get laughed out of the doctors.
The worst part is many doctors ferry you through with no thought.
I was fortunate enough to have a great doctor who offered me many treatments. My friend on the other hand went in, filled in a questionnaire and was given a medication and told to take it, thats it. No after care, no follow up. No checking to see if it worked. Many of the medications make you far far worse in the 1st week of taking it, and then after about 2 you feel great, so you stop taking it because you think you're cured, and of course then you slip back down and the cycle perpetuates.

Depression is far too often overlooked by many people. Hopefully now that someone so universally well loved as Mr Fry has caused a stir with this people might start to think a little more of the condition.

Not all. But I doubt that is what its for. Imagine you make a very good comment according to Reddittette, but for whatever reason 20 people downvote immediately (and inappropriately). The people who would ordinarily upvote such a well thought out comment, now never get to see it because its beyond their comment visibility threshold. Especially the case in a highly commented thread.

Well its clear there is pros and cons each way.

true,BigHaircutPrime,null,null,"Firstly, I want to excuse myself for being so much on the offensive. I totally regret how I stated things and I definitely deserve what backlash I'd received. Then again, I don't think what I'm saying is completely ridiculous either.

I don't think that Vastra and Jenny are used as a butt at all, and I think that John Barrowman would be incredibly offended by your statement that he's playing to stereotypes, seeing as he's gay himself and has spoken at several panels about the portrayal of gay characters in fiction. Torchwood is hyper-sexualized, but there's also a lot of depth to the relationships. His cockyness is really a mask that protects the shattered soul of a man who's fragmented and stuck in time. As for Vastra and Jenny, I think that the fact that the former's a Silurian speaks to the idea that love doesn't have to fit a particular mold. When Jenny dies in the series 7 finale Vastra flips out completely, and the tone in that moment is far from comedic.

As for the socioeconomic class of the companions, I don't agree with you either. Sure, Martha and Donna were higher class, but they were quickly brought down to reality. I don't understand the distinction between working and middle class... don't they pretty much cross over? Amy Pond and Rory are far from upper class. Amy later becomes a model, but when she's introduced she's a kiss-o-gram. Clara's a nanny, which is also far from posh. And the Victorian Clara's night job is at a bar, so I don't understand your argument.

As for race, I totally agree. My argument is against a female Doctor, not against a black Doctor. We need a greater variety of races, and not just alien races but human ones.

As for the relationships, I don't think I'm being ignorant, because my point is that it would be awkward because you are forcing a certain sexuality onto people. I totally get the argument that in a perfect world, love transcends identity, but that's not how the world functions. I think what people like you are ignoring is that you are making changes that impact people, but without their consent. If I took a lesbian/gay couple and changed the sex of one of the partners, you can't say that there isn't a problem. While the change might be voluntary for one, it's not for the other. If I fell in love with a woman and she turned into a man, things would get awkward as hell, and as much as ideally we'd like to say that sex shouldn't determine who we love, realistically it does.

I don't really like the way that you are attacking me. Keep in mind that this is my opinion, and although I haven't shown to be in the past, I'm trying to be as respectful to others as possible (I know, I've done a really bad job thus far). Please don't flaunt your education. I'm currently studying literature and history, and women's studies are a focal point in most of my classes. I don't mention that to people because it gives off the message of ""well I have this certificate that proves I'm smarter than you"". I'm not saying I'm right at all. The way I see things is simple: I push my thoughts and ideas and try to inspire debate. If I'm right, then great. If I'm wrong, then my perspectives are widened and I gain knowledge, but I never go in with the purpose of shutting people out. People have brought up so many fantastic points in this thread, such as you pointing out the lack of asian characters in the series, and it's helped me see things in a different light.

If a female Doctor's the next step, then I'll embrace it. However, I think that it should only happen if it would be used to explore the character in ways that couldn't be otherwise. I also think that if it were to happen then the Doctor would have to do a carte-blanche and turn the page on all her past relationships. It could be done right. Helen Miren was thrown out there and I would LOVE to see someone like her portray an older, wiser version of the Doctor.

There is definitely a racist issue at play.  If not you would not have all-white groups such as the EDL.  I am told that these people are racists - true or not?

Lets assume that the large majority are.  Then there are people that are racist/concerned-about-immigration - kind of half and half.  Just because they are concerned about immigration from whatever perspective - economics/socio-economics - does not make them racist.

Other issues you have raised such as lack of education and poverty - these also need to be considered.  Good points in fact - I agree with you.

All of these things should be considered together - as I have said, like a venn diagram - and critically analysed objectively.

This needs to be done carefully - very carefully - or we may give credence to maniacs such as EDL.  But also may give credence to ultra left-wing groups.  Also not good.

To say racism is part of it, is part of the issue, along with other things such as education, poverty, etc could actually push us closer to solving it, rather than skirting around it because we feel insecure talking about it.

While you may find it offensive, I find it to be a useful defensive tactic. I however find it offensive when people ask me to not do something. Unless I'm being overtly racist, sexist or homophobic (none of which the comment of my education was) the asking of someone to ""not do something"" demands control over another, and in a dialogue is uncivil. Far more so than playful banter. 

As for MY attacking YOU, I find that rich considering your past statements, and consequent admittance here (though I appreciate your apologies). 

I urge you to look further into intersectionality within women's and gender studies and you'd find that Doctor Who is far less that what it should be in terms of race, class*, gender and homosexuality. I say this because I want the show to be better than what it is, not because I don't already enjoy it.

I'm glad you tried to work all that out about how he's not scoring, but it's like you didn't even see him last season when he came in for us. I might be clinging to the past a bit, but he was putting away **everything** that came his way. Those were premier league defenses he was up against too. It's not cause they weren't playing tight enough or anything, he just got played the ball more and was more precise with his feet. The reason he was scoring is because his confidence was through the roof. He didn't give a single fuck who the defense was he just knew he was going to score. When this season rolls around he starts out well, one against Villa, two against Southampton (one of those was beautiful btw.). The only possible excuse I can find for him is that something got to his head. His confidence went out the window and he just couldn't seem to hit them on target anymore. The defenses didn't get any better, he just didn't play as well, and to be honest, all the play time that got taken away from him for Anichebe affected him, and the fact that Fellaini became the target man meant a lot less balls came in for him. You'd probably be interested to know that he also scored the same amount of goals as Anichebe (our other striker, where's your hate for him?) and Osman this season and more than Baines or Pienaar.

This is a pretty big generalization. There are certainly Roma fans who feel this way, but there are a lot of others who don't. That club is in a bit of a mess right now and Baldini just happens to be the guy willing to fall on the sword and take accountability. He's made mistakes as general manager, but so have the owners and so has the director of football. 

As a pure director of football (concerned purely with buying and selling players) he will be in his element, IMO. We already know he has a good relationship with AVB (and tried to bring him to Roma) and is good at spotting talent. We also know AVB has openly asked for a director of football to join the club. 

I think this is a good step towards backing our manager. It's a position that Levy and AVB are both on record as believing in, and it's a man who shares mutual respect with the manager and a philosophy of recruiting and developing younger players. 

If this does happen, I really hope our chairman puts some trust into the Baldini / AVB collaboration. Depending on who you talk to, AVB hasn't really yet had a chance to buy any of HIS players. If we really want him to be here for the long term, it's time to back and trust him IMO.

He was never a speed demon by any means, and he actually was similar to Zlatan in that he was a pro, at least at Milan, at gaining that half yard, he just never had the physical presence of Zlatan.

I will admit, Zlatan's size make him much less a risk than Shevchenko was, and at least Zlatan has proven successful in almost every league he plays in.

The reason I am skeptical is investing heavily (and it will require that, his wages are 250k a week, thats Torres + Sturridge wages...) in over 30 strikers is not necessarily something that has worked out well for us in the past, and it makes no sense with Torres still on the books anyway.

I'm not saying Zlatan would fail, but placing all our faith in a mega-expensive, over 30 forward has not yielded fantastic results for us in the past, something it seems many here have forgotten seemingly.

It isn't the place of government to encourage or discourage that kind of spending behaviour. All they have to do is support the industry to accomodate the spending habits of consumers.

The array of crops that can be grown in the UK is fairly limited, both by the suitable land available for agriculture and by the local climate. Traditionally we have always had a comparatively 'meaty/fishy' diet compared to other parts of the world like S.East Asia because climate conditions here are excellent for growing fodder (animal feeds). So effectively, what the government are proposing is that we all revert to some sort of medieval age diet of turnip soup and bread 3 times a day, 7 days a week....

Eating less meat isn't going to magically produce more edible crops... it might actually mean less food on everyones tables, and fodder stockpiling in warehouses. The difficulty transporting livestock and meat products means that encouraging less meat consumption here is not going to create more meat in Northern India.

I'm not unsympathetic to the plight of world hunger - but eating less here to provide more elsewhere is not, and has never been, a practical solution.

Shakhtar have no need to sell, their owner is a Ukrainian billionaire. The only reason they're selling is because the players feel like they want new challenges and/or want higher wages.

Yes, the Crown estates are not owned by the Windsor family, nor have they ever been the property of their family.

They are owned by the office of the crown as defined by parliment, and that holder is currently the queen.

Traditionally the new monarch signs over the lands to the government as a sign of deference to their governance, as the funds from the estaes were used to fund the government when the monarch ran things on their own.

Technically though, the lands belong to no one person or family. So if the queen decided not to hand the proceeds over nothing would change apart from her swift removal from the office of the crown, or a change in the law giving parliment entire control over the estates.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I think a lot of people have the same opinion but firstly the fact that Scotland has free university is a bit of an anomaly and not really any reason to lose faith in the whole project. 

Secondly, you say that you just want free trade and free travel as if there's no problem. Free trade is not really free if the regulations for products are the same. One example I remember from my degree was the case in 1982 in the ECJ of Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA. A German seller of margarine wanted to sell it's product in Belgium. 

They made it in a plastic tub that was cone shaped but Belgian law stated that margarine could only be sold in square blocks so as to differentiate it from butter. So the Belgians banned the margarine from being sold. There were no trade tariffs but trade was still prevented by regulations that don't make sense with each other. The EU then said that the Belgians could not prevent trade based on the shape of the product as it favoured domestic producers who already made the product in that way. But imagine how that would be reported in the press here:

""MEDDLING BRUSSELS BUREAUCRATS DECLARE BRITISH MARGARINE LAWS ILLEGAL""

Everyone would cry about nameless Euro-crats ruining their lives and 'traditions' because of course that stuff that they see as meddling may be essential for free trade but people hate it. None of that stuff would go away in the world that most 'free trade only' anti-EU people imagine and they'd still moan but there would be no-one in the EU to represent them. 

Thirdly, just as an aside, *you* might not miss funding for [renewable energy projects](http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/index_en.htm), [funding for Graphene research or huge projects in neuroscience](http://news.msn.com/science-technology/2-eu-science-projects-win-dollar13-billion-each), targets and rules to encourage [gender equality in the workplace](http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/121114_1_en.htm) but our environment would miss it and our under-funded universities would miss it and women would miss it. Personally I see great value in encouraging equality and in renewable energy even if that stuff is superfluous to the common market. It also makes me pleased to know that partly as a result of the EU the big, exciting research on the cutting edge of science is being done in European (probably in mostly British universities) and not American labs.

It is not fully understood medically, but we're getting better. There are multiple routes to help, one of which is medication - my experience is that the drugs are bad, but better than the alternative once it becomes a chemical imbalance. 

Things that are known to help other than medication (and thus are worth trying first), include but are not limited to: talking therapies with professionals (there are various specific techniques they can use), talking with friends and family, improving your diet, getting more exercise, and most fundamentally actually fucking doing something! 

When you don't want to get out of bed and are just contemplating how bad shit could get is the most important time to drag your arse out of bed and do something that will engage your body and your brain. Write, draw, paint, run, do house work - whatever it is just fucking do something!

Are you talking about my view on the law today, or are you carrying this over from your other replies to me on other threads and asking how I think it should ideally play out under anarchism?  Assuming the former, depending on the exact circumstances, an alleged (multiple) killer should expect to be tried in a fair court, and, regardless of the heinousness of the crime of which they're accused or their ability to pay, they should be afforded the ability to prepare the best defence available to them.  Just as you would wish if it were you who was going on trial.

&gt;Let family/friends have their revenge? Let it be simple mob justice?

&gt;Or do we keep the courts, but reform them and if so, how? Or do you actually think the current system is the best because you don't know of any others?

Ah, it appears from this that you are talking about criminal justice under anarchism, but I needed to make that explicit as it will be confusing for others who aren't following our conversation elsewhere.

There are plenty of books and articles on the topic of criminal justice and anarchism, from critiques of justice under capitalism and analyses of why capitalism breeds crime, to ideas about what might replace the current approach under conditions of anarchy.  [E.g](http://dissidentvoice.org/2012/05/an-anarchist-theory-of-criminal-justice/).  [Or](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-an-anarchist-response-to-an-anarchist-response-to-crime).  It's important to consider first how many crimes simply cease to be within anarchist communities, particularly the more communistic ones, because of the common nature of property, and all anarchist societies would expect to see a massive reduction of those crimes associated with inequality.

Most anarchists are highly critical of punishment-based systems tending more towards [restorative justice](http://www.restorativejustice.org/).  Many anarchists reject prison entirely, but I think, whilst its clear it is a heavily over-used approach currently, there are always going to be some people too sick or too wicked to be safely allowed to walk among us without constant supervision, regardless of how much crime may be laid at the feet of the economic system or result from one-off ""passion"" scenarios with a ""there-but-for-the-grace-of-god"" flavour.

true,kr239,eng-eastsusex,Portslade,"I'd like more discussion on Fuel Duty - not just waffle/feel good sentiments echoed by some politicians &amp; special interest groups, but a discussion that could hopefully end in quantitative change. 

The price we pay at the pump is all too often blamed on the oil companies, and how they're being greedy. Of course as we've seen in the news, there has been collaboration on price fixing, but this isn't what the major cost of the fuel is - it's the duty. And then the VAT @ 20% we pay on TOP of the duty. We're paying tax....on a tax. How ridiculous is that? If you charge VAT first, THEN add the duty, it would make far more sense, and give the average driver a bit of a break. 

The second issue, is the insane insurance industry bullshit we're having to endure, year on year. I've been quoted over £2000 to insure a 13 year old diesel car. Nothing special, nothing exotic, and i'm over 30, in a post code area that isn't a demilitarised zone. If i fiddle the quotes with my profession and marital status, i can get it down to about £1300 - but each company quotes a different amount, even ones with the same underwriter. At this point, they're just pulling ludicrous figures out of their arse. There needs to be a shake up in the industry - the FSA is far too complacent about it, so regulation should be switched to separate body - an OFINS for example.

Alternatively, have a system similar to that of Australia - where all drivers pay yearly to renew their license, and the money is paid into a general pool to give EVERYONE 3rd party only cover, with insurers offering fire &amp; theft/comprehensive top-up policies. That, would be a far fairer system for drivers than we currently have. 

Thirdly (and yes, i realise they're all motorist related), i'd like to see further discussion on raising the motorway speed limit to 80mph. The current limit was put in place in over 30 years ago and we're lagging behind europe. Not expecting us to jump straight to unrestricted autobahn levels of speed, but seeing as everyone drives at 75mph on the motorway anyway (unless next to a police car), shouldn't the limit be raised?",0,1370479944,null,0,false,0,cad0vw1,t3_1fplh3,t1_cad0vw1,t3_1fplh3,null,1430911485,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Samson_Uppercut,num26,,"This has been covered before, but I think Spurs will be just fine next season, for 3 main reasons. 


**Improved Record against bottom 3:**
Out of a possible 18 points in games against the top 3 (ManU, City, and Chelsea), Spurs, who finished 5th, took 8 points. Arsenal took 1. But against the relegated teams, Arse was a perfect 18/18. Spurs were 11/18. Those balanced each other out. 

However, I think it's pretty clear that it should be much easier for Spurs to bear down and get results against teams at the foot of the table next season than it will be for Arsenal to make up ground on the teams around it, (Chelsea, Manchesters, and Spurs).



**Continuity:**
Spurs brought in no less than 6 new players who were either nailed on starters (Lloris, Vertonghen, Dembele) or squad players who appeared at least every other game (Dempsey, Holtby, Siggurdson). It takes time for a team to mesh, and learn to play with each other, especially since everyone was learning a new system under a new manager. The level of familiarity that everyone starts with this season should result in improved results.



**Injuries**
While every team suffers its share of injuries, Spurs were especially hard hit at a number of positions this season. They had 1 probable starter (Kaboul) miss the entire season save a cameo in the opener. They had 2 important players each play a half season, (Parker out from Aug-Dec, Sandro out from Jan-May), as well having a period in January where they had no senior team strikers fit. Provided that their injury luck improves slightly (which is likely) and/or they get more players to cover a shortage at a particular position, like striker, than the players available should be generally superior to the team this season.",0,1370480776,null,0,false,0,cad15sc,t3_1fqs49,t1_cad15sc,t3_1fqs49,null,1430911355,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I was not using a strawman argument, but rather parsing the term, with an intent of looking at the real implication of the word.  
Any time that a man (forgive me for the assumption, but you have not stated to the contrary, and it is relevant in this conversation) dictates feminism as hostile to men, they probably have a problem. Women are actively oppressed here by society, and are consistently treated as secondary citizens. For example, consider the societal dichotomy between a man and a woman, when each of them have multiple sex partners; the man is backslapped and congratulated, but the woman is called a slut. Things big and small, noticed and not, discriminate against women in modern society. It may not be as dramatic as women expressly forbidden to attend school (in some foreign countries), but it is pernicious, pervasive, and oppressive.

For the record, the only reason I mentioned that I was male is simple: If I didn't, I would have less credibility with an average audience, because I would be assumed to be female. It is another hallmark of the oppression that we regularly ignore that women who complain about inequalities of society. Men (with privilege) are given more credibility in issues of feminism, simply as a result of being men. Long story short, I mentioned being male because it would help my argument, and you could not simply dismiss me as ""some bitchy woman complaining and manhating.""

I first heard of Estulin and the Bildeberg in 2005 - I used to be a trader so the oil prediction (almost) coming true certainly got my attention:

([Bilderberg book](http://bilderbergbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=1))

1. In 1996, after Bilderberg had met in Canada, Estulin said that war with Yugoslavia over Kosovo would take place in 1999. World´s leading intelligence journal, Jane’s Intelligence Review did not come to the same conclusion until half way through 1998.

2. In 2002 during their meeting at Chantilly, Estulin correctly predicted Iraq war for February-March 2003. At the time, every media outlet in the US was screaming war for September 2002.

3. In 2002 Estulin said that oil would go to $100/barrel by end 2007. He was off by two days. It hit $100 by January 2, 2008.

4. In 2005, Estulin said that oil would hit $150 by summer 2008. It hit $147.5/barrel

5. In 2005, Estulin said gold will hit $1000 in 2007. At the time it was hovering around $300-350/oz

6. In 2006, Estulin predicted that US economy was about to crash, just as the rest of Europe.  He said that Spanish housing market would suffer a 50% decline within a year, and was right on the money.

7. In 2007, Estulin predicted that once oil hit $150 it would plummet to about $30/barrel. All part of an economic warfare against Russia and China

8. In 2008, Estulin announced that Obama and Hillary attended Bilderberg meeting in Chantilly and that US Bilderbergers told Obama that the presidency was his to lose. They also told Hillary to stay out of his way.

What you are describing sounds exactly like depression.  The weird thing is that when you are depressed, you don't feel like something is wrong, you just feel sad and that it is perfectly normal for you to feel like that.  This is why many depressed people don't seek treatment.

They have amazing medications for this these days that can really help you without turning you into a zombie, don't bet your mental health on a second-hand anecdote from your friend.

That being said, I think I know why your friend's sister and dad said what they said.  I have friends with serious bi-polar disorder.  Yes, he doesn't get the manic highs when he is on medication, and life might seem gray if you compare normalcy with a manic high, but then it probably seems gray compared to being on crystal meth too - that doesn't mean we should all do crystal meth.  My friend is a doctor, and a very good one, which I think demonstrates that you can live a normal, happy, and productive life, with depression (even as serious as bi-polar).

I agree that gender roles are less restrictive today than ever before, but they are still too much.

Also, you say that the Doctor breaks down the typical idea of a male character but then you say he would *have to* conform to the typical idea of a female character. Why?

&gt;If he were to be a female it'd change his character because he'd be boring and conform to female gender roles or try to be an over masculine tomboy which would be a 180 of the Doctor's personality, kind of feminine.

That's not true. The current male Doctor does not conform to male gender roles and he doesn't try and be an over feminine girly girl either. It's not like you have to go to one extreme or the other.

Quirks are not male exclusive but I understand if you're not comfortable with breaking down the gender binary.

Therefore the 50 years of Doctor Who and the emphasis of there being 11 Doctors still stands, because John Hurt is just a regeneration who does not carry the name Doctor.

Since John Hurt does not carry the name Doctor, it is impossible for him to be an older, bearded version of 8, because if it really is 8 just aged, as we are assuming Hartnell aged to 80 as the 1st doctor, then 8 cannot be the Doctor anymore. And the all the emphasis on the 11 doctors up till now, would be worthless because Matt Smith would be 10, because 8 was not the Doctor.

Matter of fact, I think all the emphasis of the 11 doctors, particularly through out the most recent series, is to hit this point home: John Hurt is an unseen regeneration, not just an older version of one of the Doctor's faces who we've already seen.

He is glorified in the English press and quickly has a banner streaming in the KOP end glorifying ""JOSE HEIMRIQUE"". 

Liverpool finish the calender year in 3rd place, and still in the CC and FA cup competition. Having lost D. Agger to a broken elbow and Martin Kelly playing with a bumb ankle, Jamie Carragher comes out of retirement and starts every game the rest of the season. 

We win the CC 5-0 over United. Rafael is sent off for spitting at BR at the touchline, and BR responds with a quintessential ""Bitch Slap"" and is given a 10 match suspension. Not for the slap, but because Rafael's face was so morbidly altered the FA felt they had to make an example.

We go 10-0 without BR and Rafael has to permanently wear a face mask for the rest of his life.

We reach the FA final and face Chelsea. Torres scores a first half hat trick and mocks the LFC supporters by kissing the Chelsea emblem. This ignites our captain. Steven proceeds to kick 3 2nd half goals to make it 3-3. 118' gone and Coutinho is fouled in the box. Gerrard steps up, dumps an absolute bomb top right and runs to the supporters who rush the field in absolute majestic glory. we win 4-3.

We finish the season 1st. Suarez wins the champions League and Ballon D'or for Madrid. FSG invest heavily and we land a revamped Anfield and New Shirt Sponsor. Our Kits for 2014 are massively popular around the world. They are featured in every fashion show and magazine and are even featured in playboy. Showcased by none other than, Kate Upton.

I don't ever want to make the dreaded Drogba comparison, but in our current situation, Ba is as close as we will get without Lukaku, who I'm torn on. If we can ABSOLUTELY guarantee him at least 20 starts, keep him. Otherwise, off to Swansea.

Outside of that, we get linked with just about every striker, but I think if we were going to splash the cash it needs to be on a CM. I could see us maybe going for a Burak Yilmaz or someone of that ilk, that doesn't command the massive transfer fee and wages, but that could be a contributor (and likewise, if he flops or is just so-so, easily disposable upon Lukaku's return if we don't dispose of one of the others).

I am still sad moyes is gone but perhaps Martinez will bring us that something we are missing. I really like his positivity and he obviously has no feat of a challenge. The core we have is perfect for him to improve on. I think the main worry for all of us is defense. He can get us goals I am sure.

personally, I don't think we're done with that whole thing yet. I think we've only seen the first part of the end of the prophecy, the 50th being the second part. At least I hope so, because otherwise Moffat just ran around in circles till his feet dug up a rut and he has no satisfying way to climb out. I feel like after the 50th it will all make sense. Unfortunately, by this point, I don't think anything Moffat could come up with would satisfy the tension he's built up. At least for me anyway.

That said, I will watch and enjoy the hell out of whatever happens.
Edit: Should have read ahead, seems a few other people have already said what I was saying. I will add, though, that for all his overly complex ideas that don't quite fit together, I do love me some Moffat and I'm perfectly fine with how everything is rolling along right now.

Definitely agree that we have to spend money bringing in another CM. Essien returning gives us quality cover at multiple positions as well. I'd like to bring back Tomas Kalas and let him gain experience and provide depth in the back. 

I like your example with Burak Yilmaz. If I'm not mistaken he had a unbelievable run of goals in the champions league. Co-top scorer? Wouldn't be a bad signing at all.

That said, Mourinho should command even MORE respect this term, given what he did after he left us (in my opinion). While Abramovich will still have his preferred players, we aren't talking about Mourinho with just Porto under his belt now. I think Abram knows now that Mou not only should have some say, that his say is perhaps a bit more valuable than it was the first time when he thought he was expendable.

Outside of that, Bony would be FANTASTIC, young, probably way cheaper than Yilmaz even, and even if he doesn't explode, could easily be a Kalou type player (if he has that temperament, I don't know enough).

Yilmaz has a fantastic scoring record, but it would easily be as useless as trying to rate Bony's record in Eredivisie. Yilmaz has never played outside of Turkey, and yes, his UCL rate was fantastic last term, but I'd be wary. Honestly, if given the choice, Bony would be a cheaper option with less attached, his only downside is it sounds like he wants to move to Portugal, even ahead of a move to England.

Essien provides us EXCELLENT backup, and I was worried at first about his return, but then I realized Mourinho actually utilized him as exactly that at Madrid, backup. I don't think the Bison is quite Bison-esque anymore, he can't start week in week out, but he can *absolutely* contribute, especially since he can play emergency right back, CDM, CM, etc.

Spring blossoms, birds are beginning to piss everyone off, and Tottenham hit shit form, losing two out of four and drawing a third. They're now in desperation mode, but will find it difficult to even qualify for Europa League. Chelsea, on the other hand, are hitting all the right notes and seem poised to secure the EPL title; by putting an additional 6 points between them and Man City they find themselves 10 points clear and will go on to win the League.

Mid-April, one rainy Saturday: Joe Cole scores a late winner against Arsenal as Suarez puts in a medicore performance at Norwich, scoring a measly two goals in a 5-nil romp. Still, it's good enough to propel us ahead of the Gooners into fourth place where we eventually finish.

Or so we think. A few days before the final fixtures Howard Webb comes up and pubically admits he had accepted bribes from ManU. The FA immediately deducts 30 points and we find ourselves in third, but a mere two points separates us and a crestfallen, unmotivated Man City, who happen to be our last match of the season!

A host on a local sports station (1310 The Ticket - the greatest sports talk station ever - imagine The Man Show crossed with vintage ESPN) had a similar feeling about soccer, and he mentioned that a listener suggested he choose an EPL team, follow it closely for a year, and that would demonstrate the greatness of the game (he chose Liverpool).

I thought this was a great idea, so I set about to find a team. I researched the histories of all the lower-mid to top-tier EPL teams. For me, it came down to Everton, Tottenham, Liverpool and Fulham. I didn't want to be a front-runner and back a perpetual winner - too easy. But I wanted a team that at least had a *chance* to finish strong. It came down to Everton and Tottenham. 

Since 2010, I have followed Spurs as closely as possible, without the benefit of cable television. I watch matches in my local pub (Trinity Hall - a fantastic pub), and read everything I can about my team.

In the end, I'm not sure why I chose Tottenham. I think it had something to do with the amazing history and the awesome fan base that doesn't take itself too fecking seriously (see: West Ham, Arsenal). I liked that Tottenham were ""good guys,"" with highly respectable supporters, even if the team had fallen upon hard times.

Then, I had no idea where the team was going, let alone what the name ""Bale"" would become. I believe I chose well.

true,elbruce,wardr,Hurt,"Absolutely.  What he does (and what American actors do when they do good British accents) is to pinpoint a *specific* precise region, and do the local dialect from there.  Hugh Laurie as Gregory House does an Eastern Ohio ""crackle"" that's very distinctive of a very specific part of the U.S.  Because there isn't a such thing as an ""American accent;"" there are instead scores of regional accents.  The same is true of Britain.  Try to do an accent for the whole country and you'll fail miserably.  But do a good version of North Manchester or East End London and you're golden (ditto South Boston or West Philly).

**But:** my reasoning for this is different.  Doctor Who has a kind of patriotism (dare I say, nationalism?) that I find extremely charming.  Let me explain why:

As a 'Mercan, I've seen lots and lots of Hollywood blockbusters that involve an alien threat that more often than not lands in America (our proportional landmass odds are relatively OK, but not good overall), but when it comes down to it, *will* be fought between America on behalf of the world vs. the aliens.  Sure *Transformers* may start with a giant robot landing in Morocco or somewhere, but the real fight is going to take place in the U.S. (and inexplicably involve Shia LeBeouf).  It's ultimately up to President Morgan Freeman to make the call on that asteroid or whatever.  *Independence Day* may show alien spacecraft hovering all over the world's capitals, but when it gets down to brass tacks, it's the United States President in a fighter jet on the 4th of July who's going to kick their ass, [FUCK YEAH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnUgAaea4M)!

The only major alien movie blockbuster I can think of that *doesn't* end up relying on the U.S. would be *District 9*.  But that's a clear exception to a very established rule.

When watching all these U.S.-centric alien movies, I occasionally wonder what it's like to be someone from another country watching all of these ""America for the world vs. the aliens"" plots again and again.  

*Doctor Who* gives me that.

If a piece of space debris falls randomly through space/time into Earth's gravity well, it'll land in London during the Blitz - *of course*.  If an alien spacecraft careens out of control from orbit, it'll take off a chunk of Big Ben, or swoop dangerously low over Buckingham Palace - *of course*.  Going back to the 50's to see Elvis?  Nope, you'll land on the day of QE2's televised coronation speech - *of course*.  Who cares about the odds of that always happening?  

The simple fact of the matter is, *Doctor Who* is as much about Britain as it is about outer space or history (and how often is that *British* history?)  The *Doctor Who* universe is incredibly Brit-centric, in the same way that almost every other aliens-vs-humans show is incredibly America-centric.  Perhaps more so.

That's why the Doctor absolutely *must* be played by a true-born Brit.  Because *Doctor Who* is so fucking British it pisses tea and shits the Queen.  And I find that inherent or implied patriotism to be kinda badass.  They shouldn't throw it out, certainly not for stunt casting.  Especially not when there's so much incredible British acting talent (established or up-and-coming) to dig into - after all, they found us Matt Smith, I'm sure they can find us another great Doctor in mighty Albion.

As an American, all I have left to say to everything that the Doctor represents, is this:

true,shabab-almahdi,smith,Smith,"I also like the idea that John Hurt's regeneration was the one that ""ended"" (quote, unquote) the Time war. There's some speculation that the Time War is still going on, seeing as the Daleks keep reappearing, and Bad Wolf eliminated them, then the Time Lords came in the End of Time and they had to be pushed back into hell, etc.

However, there is a theory that I like better. When the Doctor looked into the untempered schism as an eight year old child on Gallifrey, what if he saw the final incarnation of himself, and what he would become: the most wretched being in the universe (also referenced by the Great Intelligence in the Name of the Doctor). Now suppose, he hid his name with the title of the Doctor, and kept that secret (what he saw in the untempered schism) with him, and went off with his new title, and a stolen TARDIS, to go off into the universe to fight destiny (a fixed point because he saw it in the schism though) and avoid the ending which he saw in the untempered schism. The secret of course that he's been keeping since age 8 was not his real name, although that also turned into a secret later (or perhaps at the same time), the true secret was that his last incarnation would be the John Hurt version of him.

It's not necessary that only 9, 10, and 11 are the only ones trying to cope with it. What if they all were dreading this future, and trying their best to become someone other than that ending that the schism showed. Sure, John Hurt could have ended the Time War, but what if the Time War is still going, and the actual end is much, **much** worse.

This is a quote from Fry on the BBC news edition of this story. He could not have put it better. No mentally healthy human being will ever want to voluntarily end their own lives except for the most extreme of circumstances that fundamental will to live is hard coded into us. 

Depression is an illness, a disability, as much as breaking a bone or catching a cold. You could be the most fortunate soul on the planet and still succumb to depression. The amount of blame someone should hold for being depressed is exactly the same amount as someone who has caught a common cold.

I am not trying to trivialise depression, but rather highlight the number of people who think the depressed can ""just shrug it off"" or they're ""just a bit sad"". Growing up with a sibling with clinical depression, it was not something they could just ""shrug off"". I spent my entire summer trying to help them.

Stephen Fry is a genuine 'national treasure', even homophobes find it difficult to dislike him, and he's got a massive following of fans, and it's mostly down to his personality and intellect.

Yet when the dark clouds come, he still ends up feeling worthless and useless, all the success, adoration and awards count for nothing.

I also hold him as at least partially responsible for the recent change where it seems people are actually allowed to be intelligent on TV without boring or scaring people off.

Yes, there's a contigent who only like Brian Cox 'cos he's sooo sexy' but in the end, it's a great thing that he's getting to educate people in an interesting way on TV, and I'd partly put that down to the success of QI, proving that there IS a place for smart programming on TV, and we don't all just want Total Wipeout and X Factor.",0,1370504864,null,0,false,0,cad858m,t3_1fq7ng,t1_cad858m,t3_1fq7ng,null,1430908051,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Any romance involving the Doctor NEEDS to be a drawn out affair of unrequited love, at best ignored by the Doctor (or the Doctor not even aware of it; i mean come on, the guys a TIME LORD, there's simply too much going on for this veritable GOD to notice the pining of some upright walking ape.), at worst, acknowledged and crushed, because, 'I'm the next best thing to immortal, and an alien to boot. It can never work between us.' Instead, we get kissing and dancing. UGH. 

And an AMERICAN Master? UTTER SHIT. There are exactly ZERO Americans who could ever be worthy of the Master's mantle. Eric Roberts was an embarrassing addition to an already troubled project.
