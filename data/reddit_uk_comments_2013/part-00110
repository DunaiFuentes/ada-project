In situations with unbalanced power (for example most employment contracts) the rights enforcement agency would be decided by the one with the most market power (e.g. employer).

So for example employers would (I would guess) typically require that all injuries incurred during work are treated as your own fault (and no employer liability) regardless of facts, and employers would presumably minimise spending on safety.

So you might say well you have the freedom of choice to work for a different employer.

What if there is twenty or thirty% unemployment? There will be lots of people who have the choice of starving or working for one of these kinds of employers. Basically they don't have a choice but to accept this dangerous work. Basically in the employer-employee market, the employer has all the power.

Imagine the other side of the economic cycle, where there is very little unemployment. Employers might not have as much market power so people would refuse to work under such dangerous conditions, so they would improve.

So employers would be deliberately calibrating the safety of their work environment based on how desperate people are to work for them. Basically externalising the risks of dangerous work.

I'm not sure that that is an improvement on the current situation!

Education (Student) visa is a possibility, but keep in mind that you can only work up to 20 hours a week while in school, and the annual costs of international tuition are very, very high. I'm also almost certain that UKBA have abolished post-study work visas, which allowed an international student that has graduated to remain in the UK if they had a job offer with a minimum salary.

So, with that caveat...

People who're at No10 but not in the cabinet implies that it's an advisor involved. There have been guesses that it's [Andy Coulson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Coulson) and [Rebekah Brooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Brooks). 

Both have been charged with offences relating to the [News of the World phone hacking affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_of_the_World_phone_hacking_affair). 

Allegedly, Brooks had a very strong influence on David Cameron choosing Coulson - another News International employee - as his communications director. There have been allegations, based on the content of text messages between them including an [archaic vulgar pun](http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/hamlet/H32.html#116), amongst other things, that Cameron and Brooks may have had a personal relationship that was inappropriate. They probably just about get away with that one, though, as there is no other evidence for it.

However, if Brooks and Coulson were indeed having an affair and this is in any way provable, then you've got Coulson completely in Rupert Murdoch's pocket via the massive leverage of either Brooks' vagina's own power or the threat of blackmail if the affair did come out, right in Number Ten. 

It's a massively compromised position to start with, even without the fact that they're both awaiting trial over the phone hacking, perjury and attempts to pervert the course of justice.

So, yes, messy indeed.

*If*... and that's a very big if, Cameron was also shagging Brooks, and the triangle here means that this might come during the trial, then this might be a resigning matter for Cameron and hasten a general election.

Even if Cameron and Brooks weren't up each other, her having the leverage to get Coulson into Number Ten is worrying at best anyway, but if they were having an affair, is likely to be seriously embarrassing for Cameron. Possibly a resigning matter. Definitely one that will hurt him a lot.

**TLDR** It's speculated that it's Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson. They're both awaiting trial. They're also in Rupert Murdoch's pocket and, if true, gave him, via Brooks, massive leverage in government in terms of access to stories and potentially over policy too.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"I'm 21 but wouldn't class myself as libertarian:

1. Disagree, I think the market can fail and thus there should be a role for the public sector in specific areas of society: healthcare and education for example. Also I think the government should compete alongside the market by having a public run company in major industries like the BBC competes along Sky and ITV in media. Also government should invest and promote green technology and R&amp;D as well as other areas which will benefit the country in the long run but the market is lagging behind on. The tax system should also aim to reflect this through green taxes for example.

2. Disagree, I am in the minority on this one as I feel most people on the left and right in favour of Swiss style neutrality but I am in favour of humanitarian intervention. The minimum amount of force necessary should only be used however, ideally it'd be done via the UN and alongside our allies in the EU/NATO. I'd be in favour of reducing the military budget and instead improve our collaboration with our allies like France and Turkey. I'd also like to see the end of the lapdog mentality we've developed towards the US in the past decade or so and instead build partnerships with EU countries (and other powers outside). I'd also massively expand the number of overseas diplomatic staff we have and British diplomatic presence abroad, they will be in charge of building connections with foreign governments, improving trade/business links and will inevitably improve relations with Britain and prevent war. Alongside this, I'd like to see the expansion of the BBC abroad so there's BBC news/radio channels in every major language/country (I know there's already a lot) and further funding of British cultural institutions which have an impact globally like the British Film Institute and museums. 


3. Generally in favour but government should punish companies which pollute, produce waste, have poor employment rights and treat workers badly as well as those which outsource at every opportunity and use tax loopholes. Competent regulation, taxes, fines and prosecution should stop irresponsible companies misbehaving and preference for government contracts and reduced tax burdens for responsible companies which operate ethically should promote good corporate behaviour and a healthy market. 

4. Agree. Also marriage would hold no legal weight whatsoever. It'd have exactly the same legal status as boyfriend/girlfriend.

Assuming that's representative, there's a culture of sheer reluctance to work and I don't think that should be in anyway supported. 

*Skint* is about as representative of unemployed people as *Queer As Folk* was about homosexuals. It's a bit like the DM articles about ""Unemployed **IMMIGRANTS**"" receiving a Kings random in housing benefit - whilst the situation they present is indeed correct, it applies to a handful of people across the country.

There are undoubtedly people who play the system - There's a couple who live in my apartment complex who immediately spring to mind. I work full-time; they sit on their backsides, receiving a comparable amount in benefits to my salary. One of them can't speak English.

But does that mean that everyone in receipt of benefits is some lazy, workshy so-and-so? Of course not. Similarly that also doesn't mean people who come to this country from abroad fail to integrate. I know plenty of people who parents came to the UK, settled, integrated and raised extremely pleasant and nice kids. 

I know a seventy year old Hindu guy, for example, who came to the UK barely able to read and write - he's now a recently retired business owner, who speaks ""posher"" English than me, and who worked all hours to send his kids to decent schools.

true,Lrrr23,mccoy,McCoy,"I for one really liked the Six/Peri relationship, because it's very different to the usual dynamic. It's a lot more akin to Stockholm Syndrome imo.

Peri wasn't given any choice about joining, she wondered onto the Tardis and was taken away. She didn't ask Five to go back because he was ""sweet"" and wanted to travel. Then two trips in, he changes. He's not the man she agreed to travel with. Now he's flawed, arrogant, offensive and violent. She asks to go home in Twin Dilemma and he refuses if I recall correctly. From that point on Peri is thrown into worse and worse situations, never really given a chance to relax or even a choice. Slowly, as Six mellows she starts to get on with him better, but she's still constantly put through hell by this man, that once again, she didn't choose to travel with.

While the accent is annoying, it wasn't Nicola Bryant's idea, and apart from that I find her acting charming. She complains a lot, but more than any other companion, she has every right to. She's very much the victim.

As for Six himself, I like the idea of a flawed Doctor. His arrogance is usually what gets him in trouble, and usually doesn't play out well. And I found there to be quite an interesting layer of menace in his completely unpredictable and unstable violent streak.

Cech has had a consistently good season as always. We're lucky to have two world class keepers in him and Courtois. Turnball gets a highish rating because he stepped up when Cech was injured and put in some solid performances. Unfortunately we don't have Cudicini on the bench anymore ...

_____

**Defence**: Ivanovic: 8/10 | Azpi: 8.5/10 | Cahill: 8.5/10 | JT: 6.5/10 | Luiz: 9/10 | Cole: 8/10 | Bertrand: 7/10 

When RDM was around we didn't have a connected backline. When Benitez came in it grew stronger and stronger. Ivanovic has made a couple of big errors this season but has generally been very good. Azpi has had an extremely good first season in England which justifies that 8.5 I believe. Cahill (in my mind) seems a bit underappreciated by some of the Chelsea fans as I really think he's been one of our best defenders this season. However, Luiz takes that spot. At CB he really has been world class and much improved over last season.

Before I get questioned about Bertrands highish rating. He's inevitably going to get compared to one of the best defenders of his generation, Ashley Cole, but when he's needed to he's put in some stellar performances this season. He won't ever reach the quality of Cole but I haven't been worried when he's been playing and considering his lack of game time he's looked pretty good.

_____

**Midfield**: Mikel: 7.5/10  | Rami: 7.5/10 | Lamps: 8.5/10 | Moses: 7.5/10 | Oscar: 8/10 | Mata: 9.5/10 | Hazard 9/10 | Marin 4/10

Mikel and Ramires have generally had pretty good seasons. Ramires seemed to be a bit hit and miss towards the end of the season but I guess that's partly down to the ridiculous amount of matches we've had. Mata has been our best player this season and pretty much played a part in 90% of the goals we've scored.

_____

**Strikers** Torres: 7.5/10 | Ba: 6.5/10

Ba hasn't been that great at all unfortunately IMO but Torres has been *pretty good*. We won't ever see him in the form that he was in at Liverpool but generally I thought he's had a pretty good season. He's scored a decent amount of goals - could be better - but he's played a part in quite a few others that we've scored so ultimately he's done well this season.

**Pavlyuchenko** - Great striker, one hell of a shot. Bit more ""lone wolf"" than most, but still a team player. Scored a lot of goals as a sub in his last few seasons, and saved our arses doing it. When we had him, we were playing Crouch every game. Crouch was a weak link at that point and Pav was continually coming on and scoring goals to save us. This resulted in us loving Pav and begging Redknapp to play him, but obviously he's a stubborn guy and would only do it after thousands of yids sang his name every week.",0,1370199793,null,0,false,0,caarpts,t3_1fj42q,t1_caarpts,t1_caarfpf,null,1430950496,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16

I'm from Scotland, so I got my undergraduate fees paid for me by the Scottish Government.

I know that students from the rest of the UK paid a particular rate (although were usually funded by their LEA or the SLC) and that EU students paid a slightly higher rate (but again were generally funded by their member state).

By far the highest fees were those levied against international students, as the only financial support available to them was whatever loans or grants they could obtain from their home country.

Let's say you want to do medicine at UCL in London.

If you were from the UK/EU you would be charged £9,000 per year for tuition (just tuition, that doesn't include living costs), with that probably being funded by the Government. An international student would pay a whopping £29,000 per year for tuition with no support being available from the UK Government.

It's true that UCL is one of the better Universities in the UK, but the situation for international fees is broadly the same no matter where you go, and whilst a student visa will allow you a limited amount of work... it's not going to cover your tuition.",0,1370199817,null,0,false,0,caarq3s,t3_1fiwh4,t1_caarq3s,t1_caarfwz,null,1430950491,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Again, you've been tricked.  It's not a gift.  You've paid Income Tax, National Insurance and VAT.  If you have no other income then you're entitled to Social Security.  It's a safety net that we all share and it's a damn shame that you've been made to feel like you have to be humbled for using it.   

&gt; someone else's money   

It's not, it's yours.  Spend it on whatever you want.   

If you want to go without food so you can save your JSA up and buy an expensive football shirt, that's your business.  Though I must say I've been around (and been myself) people who are on the dole my whole life and though we may get together the money for a few pints in a beer garden from time to time (heaven forbid!) brand new football shirts are out of the question.  Unless of course somebody buys one for you like I did for my brother-in-law once when he was unemployed.  

Once you've crossed that line from THE TAXPAYER over to THE BENEFIT CLAIMANT you might appreciate just how much bullshit you've been fed.

Moffat has struck me as a writer who can produce some really quality material when he has ideas. The problem I think is that he can't produce those ideas consistently and on schedule. As such he works *very* well as a second writer, able to produce one off episodes and ideas to a great standard. But he's lost when he needs to keep throwing out those ideas consistently.

&gt;I think it's a good idea if we have a pub quiz and maybe make it weekly or fortnightly, this would be good to get more people involved in the sub and would be a bit of fun anyway.

We need ideas on:

* Who is the quiz master (I'm not doing it...)

* How to sort people into teams

* Where to conduct it (I thought maybe through IRC because you can put teams in different channels)

* Types of questions and rounds

* Super fantastic prizes (Maybe flairs for members of winning team)

* This would rely on people not cheating of course... and this is not actually official, I just made that up.

You'd be better off (in my opinion) getting a geology degree then working in the oil industry as you'll get paid a lot more. I guess it depends on where exactly your interest lies. Also in terms of the amount paid, my friend said that it's not actually as high as you would expect, although technically you are only working for about half the year so you are paid more per day than other jobs. I cant remember how much it actually was though. 

Regardless of what you want to do (i.e. degree first or just go straight in), I recommend that you read a book called [""Fire in the night: The piper alpha disaster""](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-Night-Piper-Alpha-Disaster/dp/0330471937/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370203890&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fire+in+the+night).

This is really about 'no-platform', which I concede seems to be an unpopular idea (on here anyway, I can only assume this subreddit is a reasonable sample of British people). So anti-fascists would argue that far-right groups should have their events disrupted because their views are objectively bad - not just views that anti-fascists disagree with but views that are hateful and will incite hatred if left uncontended. 

Furthermore I think anti-fascists like the UAF would argue that allowing far-right groups to do what they like will lead to more harm in the long run (a normalisation of racist/homophobic/etc views in society, and eventually discrimination against minority groups). 

I think it's certainly worth noting that anti-fascism only exists as a response to far-right groups (the clue's in the name!). While some anti-fascists have certainly chosen direct, violent methods of achieving their aims of trying to prevent far-right views becoming culturally acceptable, I think it's important not to dismiss all anti-fascist groups for the same reason. Which is what I worry about when you get these sweeping statements that 'Unite Against Fascism is worse than the BNP!', and the like.

Even when phoning up to purchase BT I got an indian with a strong accent.

Mata: 9/10, Obviously the best player on the team

Hazard: 8.5/10, Started really strong, lost his way around mid season, but finished strong. Has the skill to surpass Mata.

Cech: 8/10, Solid, nothing else to be said

Cole: 8/10, Makes a lot of plays that doesn't get in the highlight reels.

Luiz: 7.5/10, When he is good, he is great, when he is off, he is way off. Need more consistency

Ivanovic: 7.5/10, Solid all around, made some very costly mistakes

Oscar: 7/10, Not playing in his natural position, still played very well. Needs to bulk up.

Lampard: 7/10, Left the midfield open to look for his goals. On the other hand, scored some important goals.

Ramires: 7/10, Similar to Lampard. Was really ugly when paired up with him. Please no more.

Torres: 6.5/10, Very bad start. Finished strong. 

Azpi: 6.5/10, Can definitely improve. Crosses... ugly.

Cahill: 6.5/10, Consistant

Moses: 6/10, Disappointed after ACON. 

Mikel: 6/10, Just seemed to have lost his place.

Ba: 6/10, Faded after a strong start.

Terry: 5.5/10, Mostly injured. Unfortunately, not even close to the same Terry as before.

Bertrand: 5/10, Average, serviceable backup. Can't see him being able to replace Cole.

Turnbull: 4/10, Always looked shaky. Please find another backup.

Yossi: 3/10, didn't really do anything.

Especially if you get a high 2.1 you can definitely put your module grades on your UCAS form so as to distinguish you from other 2.1 applicants. Make sure you get a good reference as well, ideally by a lecturer that knows you personally, it can make a lot of difference.

That's great, just keep it up.

&gt;Sorry, I'm confused what you mean. Could you clarify?

If we allow people with valid (but vile) political opinions to be silenced - the BNP, then it'd be UKIP next. I'm saying that we shouldn't ever judge what political opinions are open for people to support, because if we allow it for the BNP it could be abused to marginalise any minority opinion.

&gt;To be honest I don't disagree with most of this. But do you think this is true of Greece at the moment? Would you not concede that violent tactics may be justified to prevent the rise of fascism in certain situations?

We're not Greece, and even there fascism hasn't taken hold. As for violence, I'd support violent tactics if we no longer had representative democracy or as a response to a coup to try to enforce that.

I don't support that kind of inch by inch justification for violently opposing a party like the BNP who get a tiny amount of the vote and show no real prospect at all of getting a single MP never mind a majority in commons.

I'm very reluctant to fly any colours though as I find people who say ""Oh I'm SWP"" end up defending things they don't entirely support and attacking things they may not be opposed to. 

Here's one of my favourite quotes, which I often take ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant"" from. I genuinely believe that the extreme parties if forced to list their policies will either alienate their existing vote base or their potential vote base, and you cannot be all things to all people.

Then again, it's misleading to look at the religion in isolation, Christianity and Islam are the only two global religions which are widely seen across continents whereas Dharmic religions are confined to just a few countries (or in the case of Sikhism mainly one state in India). 

I'd agree with you on the hostile/violent response to cartoonists but these are usually stoked up by groups hostile to western governments and merely use the cartoons as a tool to gain popularity, similar to the EDL who use events like the beheading to rile up their supporters. When these groups don't mobilise there's muted response, e.g. when French magazine Charlie Ebdo did it more recently or [when South Park had their Muhammad character in 2002 and 2003](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509667/Mohammeds-appearance-on-South-Park-fails-to-spark-outcry.html):

&gt;An episode of South Park, the controversial American cartoon show, which featured a visual portrayal of the prophet Mohammed, has been screened on British television twice and can currently be viewed on the internet.

&gt;The episode, entitled The Super Best Friends, did not attract a single complaint from Muslim clerics when it was aired by Channel 4 in 2002 and 2003. The lack of protest is in stark contrast to the controversy over the recent newspaper publication of cartoons depicting Mohammed.

Regarding sexism, anti-Semitism and homophobia I'd agree it is a problem among Muslims in the Middle East especially but generally in the UK I'd say the only area where there is significant divide compared to the mainstream population is perception of homosexuality although British Muslims' [perception on gay people and gay rights is pretty liberal](http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2011/06/27/surprise-poll-shows-widespread-muslim-support).

&gt;Muslims in Britain have zero tolerance towards homosexual acts compared to their counterparts in France and Germany, according to a survey published today.

&gt;The Gallup poll features the results of telephone and face-to-face interviews with Muslims and non-Muslims in the UK, France and Germany and is designed to measure global attitudes towards people from different faith traditions.

&gt;It shows that British Muslims hold more conservative opinions towards homosexual acts, abortion, viewing pornography, suicide and sex outside marriage than European Muslims, polling markedly lower when asked if they believed these things were morally acceptable.

&gt;The most dramatic contrast was found in attitudes towards homosexuality. None of the 500 British Muslims interviewed believed that homosexual acts were morally acceptable. 1,001 non-Muslim Britons were interviewed.

I could say with just as much credibility (read: none) that he doesn't trust Mata in a number 10 role.

&gt;wants to bank up some cash towards the spending spree

We do not need to sell Luiz to be FFP compliant. We made [€43.4 million](http://swissramble.blogspot.com/2013/05/uefa-prize-money-rhapsody-in-blue.html) from our Champions League/Europa League campaign this season alone (to say nothing of TV, match day, and sponsorship revenues). Thats only €15m less than last year, when we spent roughly £90M in the transfer window. Jose will have his cash, no need to worry about that. Chelsea have never needed to sell to buy in the Abramovich era.

You also have to consider the fact that if we sold Luiz, we'd have to find a replacement. Best case scenario the difference between what Luiz fetches and what the replacement costs is £15-20M. I assure you that Chelsea do not need to part with a marquee player to finance £20M worth of purchases.",0,1370211890,null,0,false,0,caavj30,t3_1fjaw0,t1_caavj30,t1_caauz2r,null,1430948629,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Here is why I have Son on the team. I feel the suggested price is easily paid as it "" was"" reported to be quite fair and lower than I had expected, making Son the ideal choice. This guy is a must have.

"" Son is known as a versatile attacker due to his ability to use both feet equally well; although he often plays the role of a second striker with Hamburg, he can play either as a striker or winger on either side as well as even an attacking midfield role. Son has confirmed this, saying, ""I don't care where I play. The main thing is I'm in the game. I can play right, left, as a forward or behind. What the coach says, I'll do. I don't have a favorite position. I'll be anywhere and always on the throttle.""",0,1370213124,null,0,false,0,caavwdd,t3_1fj7nf,t1_caavwdd,t3_1fj7nf,null,1430948453,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

But at the same time I think it's difficult to simply say, if we don't get 4th place, Rodgers out. I think we have to look at it in terms of points.

In the last few seasons:

* 2010-11: 58 points (6th place)
* 2011-12: 52 points (8th place)
* 2012-13: 61 points (7th place)

I think a significant improvement would be at least 70 points. And then let the chips fall where they may regarding a Champions League spot. To me, that is the expectation.

I can attest with absolute certainty that Nick Griffin is not convincing. He was on Question Time and looked like an utter fool.

As for Farage he has something to say. My issue with Farage is his party, they're a bunch of malcontent reptiles, racists, Little Englanders and other unpleasants. UKIP have in no way policed their membership and haven't in any way sufficiently vetted their candidates.

Add to that in recent years UKIP has lurched to the authoritarian right, previously they had little to say and in some cases were quite liberal.

It's troubling that you can't seem to get a fag paper between sensible immigration policies and swivel-eyed xenophobes. Partly that's Labour's fault for playing the racist card any time someone talked about immigration. Right now the public are misinformed and believe that immigration is a bad thing.

The only bad immigration are the scam student visas, and the poor from the EU coming here to get benefits (which they aren't really doing at the moment but we need to watch for).

Nobody seems to share that view. It's either cut down total immigration numbers, which is stupid. Or it's don't talk about immigration you're racist.

Farage at least went to Romania to show how desperately poor it is. And if anyone is in any doubt about why Romanians might come to the UK if there's a prospect of a life on the margins here on what we would consider far below the poverty line, take a look at him in Romania.

Do you have a degree? Without one you can't get in. You can come over here to study on a work permit, that will last for however long you study plus an additional 4 months to find work at the end of it. You can work for up to 20hrs/week during term time, and 40hrs/week during holiday. Tuition averages $18,000/year, and you'll need an additional $11,000-$14,000 per year to support yourself. Any credits you might have from the odd college class here and there will not transfer, and associates degrees don't count as anything either.

If you have a degree, it becomes slightly easier. Since IT isn't on the shortage list, you'll have to be exemplary in your field in order to get in because your employer will have to prove that they couldn't find a single person in the EU to fill that job before they begin to look for foreign work. As you can imagine, that's a pretty hard task to complete. You cannot come to the UK and look for work as a tourist, if you do you will be kicked out and probably given a short ban on entry.

true,concretepigeon,eng-yorkshire,Wakefield,"I personally don't believe Boris will ever be party leader or Prime Minister. And there are a number off issues he'd face even if that happens:

1. The time scale of a leadership election would probably mean Boris wouldn't be able to run, especially given that Cameron as incumbent leader would control the date of both his resignation and moving the writ for any by-election, admittedly within a (fairly broad) time period.

2. As leader Cameron has far greater control over the selection process in a by-election than he does over individual seats in a general election and he could probably block a threat, even a high profile one like this.

3. Should Johnson be elected and then draw Cameron into running a put-up-or-shut-up election, he'd attract a lot of bad will from the party faithful, given he's made winning the next election far harder.

4. He's still mayor and can only be an MP for up to one year of his term, which makes May 2015 a much more realistic date for a potential return to Westminster.

More broadly, I think his support is a mile wide and an inch deep. People like him, but have no idea what he stands for. His popularity seems to come mostly from the fact that he's not taken very seriously and nobody knows what he stands for. People in London didn't exactly turn out in droves to support him in 2012.

All of the stuff everyone does at school is within the scope of geography but there is a lot of stuff within the subject that I, and many others that I know, would consider to be much more useful, interesting, relevant, engaging etc. Especially things like like how/why nationalism emerges, how urban areas express Marxist theory, orientalism (i.e. what is 'the West'? and why do we have 'West' vs 'the rest'?), and geopolitics (such as: how did 9/11 impact foreign policy? is the 'War on Terror' justifiable/useful?).  I mean, at one point I did a 15 minute presentation on the rivalry between FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol.

I'm not saying that all the above is necessarily appropriate at GCSE/A-Level but most pre-university stuff is too 'text-booky' and boring compared to stuff you'd study at university. All my presentations at school revolved around fair trade chocolate or windfarms or something equally tedious.

Plus MAPS. They are awesome. And interesting. Every geography classroom has a world map but you're never told about how/why maps developed and how all maps are subjective representations of the world rather than objective. For instance, on the [standard map of the world (aka the Mercator projection)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mercator-projection.jpg) the Northern hemisphere (Europe, North America) is made to look much bigger than it really is compared to the rest of the world.

true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"I agree. He has all the qualities I love in a left back, and he has such physical strength. Sure, he's liable to get caught out of position, but that's the case with every top full-back. They work the touchline and overlap and it's the job of the deep midfielder to cover for them. They have their defensive duties, obviously, but they're expected to push forwards and contribute significantly to build-up play. 

Every legendary full-back has been criticised for getting caught out of position (often by pundits who were centre backs). The ability to cover ground quickly and get back goalside of your man is the important thing, and Enrique has got a swift pair of legs under a torso seemingly made of solid beef. He's technically gifted and physically rock solid. 

The effect he must have on an opposing defender who is already dealing with a tricky winger must be disconcerting - you finally think you've contained a roaming Suarez or Coutinho, or an energetic Sterling, and then this raging bull comes storming up the wing like an angry chimp hot and fresh from a cannon. The guy's got to stay. I'm a huge Enrique fan.

EDIT: When I played competitive football I used to play RB, but got moved to RW because I was often caught out of position. That has in no way influenced my opinion on full-backs. Ahem ;)

&gt;In a clinical field study, BCG vaccination of free-living badgers reduced the incidence of positive serological test results by 73.8 per cent. In common with other species, BCG did not appear to prevent infection of badgers subjected to experimental challenge, but did significantly reduce the overall disease burden. A key finding of the field study, conducted over four years in a naturally infected population of more than 800 wild badgers in Gloucestershire, was that vaccination resulted in a 74 per cent reduction in the proportion of wild badgers testing positive to the antibody blood test for TB in badgers. BCG vaccination of badgers could comprise an important component of a comprehensive programme of measures to control bovine TB in cattle.
The results of the modelling were:

&gt;• **A combined strategy of vaccination in a ring around a culling area was more successful than the cull-only strategy, which in turn was more successful than the vaccination-only strategy,** both in reducing the number of TB infected badgers and cattle herd breakdowns. Ring vaccination partly mitigated the detrimental effects of culling. However, the combined strategy requires about twice as much effort than either single approach done in isolation

&gt;• **Culling of badgers should continue for at least four years to realise a clear benefit**. However, low rates of land access for culling, or low culling efficiency, or the early cessation of a culling strategy was likely to lead to an overall increase in cattle herd breakdowns (whilst this is not the case for vaccination).

&gt;The blood test is not an absolute indicator of protection from disease, so the field results cannot tell us the degree of vaccine efficacy. While the findings indicate a clear effect of vaccination on badger disease, data from the laboratory and field studies do not lend themselves to giving a definitive figure for BadgerBCG vaccine efficacy. Nor do they provide information on the effect of badger vaccination in reducing TB incidence in cattle.

&gt;Professor Glyn Hewinson, Head of the TB Research Group at the VLA, and Professor Robbie McDonald, Head of the Wildlife and Emerging Diseases Programme at Fera, said: ""VLA and Fera are very proud to have conducted the programme of work on BadgerBCG and that a vaccine is now available for use in the field as one of the tools for tackling bovine TB. In making the data available today, we hope that people will be able to see for themselves the detailed research that went into the development of the vaccine and understand the opportunities and challenges of using vaccination.""

&gt;Badger vaccination could help reduce the prevalence and severity of bovine TB in a badger population and thereby reduce the rate of transmission to cattle.

&gt;The first injectable badger vaccine, BadgerBCG, was licensed in March 2010 and is available for use on prescription. Badgers need to be trapped by trained operators under licence by Natural England and the vaccine must be administered by a veterinarian or accredited lay vaccinator.

&gt;An oral badger vaccine, which may be a more practical option in terms of field deployment, is at the research stage and is still several years away. It may also be a cheaper alternative, although this is not currently clear without a final product, so cannot be guaranteed. There are significant technical challenges to overcome in developing and licensing an oral badger vaccine, particularly as an oral vaccine is technically difficult to formulate.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Of the top of my head, if they picked you specifically out they were probably using s.23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act which allows searches for drugs with reasonable suspicion. But s.163 says it's an offence not to stop when told to by a uniformed officer meaning they can stop you for whatever reason and they can then request your driver's licence and insurance etc. They get reasonable suspicion that you are high or have drugs in the car then they can search you as above. 

If it was a genuinely random stop check with no reasonable suspicion and it wasn't just a case of you not realising they had reasonable suspicion then (to my knowledge) submitting to a search must have been voluntary and you could have said no. However reasonable suspicion can range from anything from poor driving to the smell of drugs or you looking high to them. I would be very tentative to advise that you refuse a search and if you do, do it in a calm way and explain your concerns about whether they have reasonable suspicion. They are all aware of the law and will explain your legal position if you ask them. What I would never do is lock your car and be aggressive. Your getting into a whole world of new offences there. In short they can stop you for anything but **I think** they need suspicion to search. 

If you refuse to comply with a lawful search it's an offence so they could detain you or arrest you if you do so and get the keys off you. They would need to explain their suspicions to you however and if they did not then it was voluntary. If your worried you can request the report of the stop and search that the police officer did within 3 months of the search and you can always take that report and your problem to the [Citizen's Advise Bureau](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england.htm) who will give you free, confidential and independent legal advice.

true,vishbar,eng-hampshire,Yank in Winchester,"&gt; Americans say they didn't lose the war. Their objective of the Vietnam war was to stop communism spreading. We didn't have any special agenda, or goal.

The US is a nation of 315 million, saying ""Americans say..."" is usually not too accurate. That being said, I agree that Vietnam was a loss, and I don't know why we're still talking about it. It has nothing to do with the American revolution. In fact, I'd say the American revolution is a far clearer defeat than Vietnam. The US didn't *directly* lose anything in the Vietnam war other than some soldiers' lives. However, the British came out the other end of the American Revolution with a pretty large chunk of territory no longer part of the empire. 

&gt; We just removed our troops and if I recall correctly many weren't even part of the British army. Many were Loyalists and Germans. 

Yes, the British hired Hessians to assist in the military operations in the colonies...but, who cares? that's completely tangential to the point. Both sides hired mercenaries.

&gt; Plus the fact that you needed Frances help is a loss in itself. 

...how? The fact that a small domestically-grown militia needed help taking on the greatest global military power the world had ever seen shouldn't come as a surprise. Also, I'd *love* to know what military academy would teach that having an ally in a fight is a ""loss"". That's completely ludicrous. There's a reason the revolutionaries courted the French: they knew they'd need the help.

Also, it wasn't as simple as ""The French did all the work"". The Battles of Saratoga were a crushing victory for the American forces and were, in fact, the reason the French entered the war.

So yes, the British were militarily defeated and made a decision not to pursue further combat. There's a word for that in military science: ""defeat"". Could the British forces have tripled down, declared total war, and wiped out the Colonial opposition, in the process losings many many many soldiers, neglecting military commitments worldwide, and losing popular support for the war? Probably so, just as the US could have destroyed the North Vietnamese military by atom-bombing the hell out of Vietnam. However, both countries made a decision not to pursue further combat because the price wouldn't be worth accomplishing their goals in the region. Honestly, saying that the Americans ""didn't win"" and that France's help was somehow shameful reflects a fairly skewed view of the conflict at the time.",0,1370222341,null,0,1370249660,0,caayo8g,t3_1fhpxk,t1_caayo8g,t1_caaybdl,null,1430947146,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But one thing that all of his finales have had is character value. Rose couldn't survive the time vortex without Nine absorbing it, killing himself in the process. 

Ten couldn't live happily ever after with Rose after the cyberman/Dalek invasion 

Ten couldn't just erase the previous year for Martha's family, they were permanently scarred. Martha saw that and left him for them. 

Donna couldn't embrace the regeneration energy without killing herself, only surviving as a mere shadow of her former self. 

Wilf has to live with Donna every day, knowing that she is so much more than she knows, but she can never know. 

The Master, The Doctor's only remaining rival/friend/time lord companion sacrifices himself after realizing his mistake to save the universe. 

Take that as apposed to: 

Amy, Rory, River and The Doctor break the universe, but it's fine because everything is back to normal after.

The Doctor is going to die, it is fact that it shall be at this point and place.

Unless he's in a robot of himself, then we can just play it for jokes. 

How this seasons finales value will be remains to be seen, River had the best possible exit for her character here after two and a half seasons of convoluted attempts at character progression. Clara  and The Doctor both dove into his deadly timestream, it's my hope that it all gets tied in and 11 dies throwing Clara out.

On the other hand, Tenant IMO captures it perfectly in ""The family of blood"" 

&gt; He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing. The fury of the Time Lord. And then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he'd run away from us and hidden. He was being kind. He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains, forged in the heart of a dwarf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there forever. He still visits my little sister once a year every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror, every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you, just for a second, that's her. That's always her. As for me, I was suspended in time. And the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their protector.(Baines has become a scarecrow.) We wanted to live forever, so the Doctor made sure that we did. 

hes KIND to his enemies. he runs to save them from himself. He recognizes himself turning into a monster but does it anyways to save the innocents around him. He tries to save everyone.. even his enemies.

So Rafa and Luka, although terrific 'ballers, aren't legends, for me at least. Obviously everyone has their own definitions.

The ones I mentioned have all either won something, been at spurs long enough to be considered lillywhite, etc. etc.

Defoe could be called a legend, he's played over 250 games for us, and won the Carling Cup in '07 (I think). But... would he be considered a legend? Hmm, I almost think that the legend status requires you to be an amazing talent.

If Bale left, there's no way he'd be considered a legend in my eyes, just another mercenary. However if he stayed, then I'm sure he'd be lauded as one of the best spurs players ever, especially if we won something with him, or even just knocked arsenal down into 5th consistently.

But it all really depends. It helps that both Gazzas (didn't know which you meant! Lineker and Gasgoigne) both went abroad.

I do, somewhat, have an issue with Klinsman. He was at the Lane for one season in '94 I think it was, and is hailed as a spurs legend. Albeit, he scored a nice number of goals as well as being a fan favourite through hilarious celebrations, and was also seriously attacked by the media, too! But he got over it and won the Writer's association award (one G-Baz won this year). He's in madame Taussauds wax museum for christ's sake! So I suppose he's a legend because of his humour, and immediate success. But was only with us for a year.

true,cobaltace,null,null,"       9 was very PTSD and most of his journey in his singular series was to accept himself and what he had done. 10 loved adventure and excitement and he absolutely loved himself and being the Doctor but he struggled with loneliness and lose.
          Now, 11 is my favorite. Over the course of his journey you see Matt Smith play a fantastic old man in a young man's body. The aloofness and goofiness (while something that really makes me relate to him) is his way of coping with all he's been through. He puts on a happy face and follows all those silly and goofy impulses we all have. Why? Because if he stops for a while he finds himself angsty and sad. And nobody likes to be angsty and sad. Not even the Doctor.
       But when he gets serious, when the situation calls for it. You see the silliness fade a bit. Because 11 has to face it and he gets frustrated and angry. And Matt Smith portrays that so well. When we get into series 7B we see 11 embrace  this seriousness a little more. It's this gradual evolution of personality that makes Matt Smith such a brilliant Doctor.

The Doctor is almost entirely limited to defining himself (itself, though we've only seen male Doctor's so far) by his mental self.  Sure, each Doctor changes a bit here and there, but The Doctor is generally the same person throughout.

&gt;  
&gt;Now, 11 is my favorite. Over the course of his journey you see Matt Smith play a fantastic old man in a young man's body. The aloofness and goofiness (while something that really makes me relate to him) is his way of coping with all he's been through. He puts on a happy face and follows all those silly and goofy impulses we all have. Why? Because if he stops for a while he finds himself angsty and sad. And nobody likes to be angsty and sad. Not even the Doctor.
&gt;
&gt;   But when he gets serious, when the situation calls for it. You see the silliness fade a bit. Because 11 has to face it and he gets frustrated and angry. And Matt Smith portrays that so well. When we get into series 7B we see 11 embrace  this seriousness a little more. It's this gradual evolution of personality that makes Matt Smith such a brilliant Doctor.
&gt;
&gt;I disagree with you completely and that is what makes shows like this so great because of how big of a difference we have in opinions!

1) I think he'll die much the same way he ""died"" at the end of The Big Bang. There will be a massive threat to the universe and he'll realize that he'll have to die in order to stop it. His companion will be opposed to the idea so he'll say that he has a different plan. At the last minute, he'll sacrifice himself anyway with a ""Geronimo!"" thrown in for good measure. He'll smile as he goes (for the sake of the companion) and we'll get to see the sadness in his eyes before he ""dies.""

2) Probably ""Geronimo!"" though I'd prefer it to be following a moving monologue.

3) Given 11's rather whimsical nature, I expect the next regeneration will be more serious and methodical. 11 got caught up in his own legend (which, honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed), but 12 will likely be more low-key. 12 will help save the universe just as frequently, but will be more likely to pass the praise onto someone else so as to maintain anonymity.

4) I'm really sad to see Smith go. His incarnation of the Doctor reminded me of Grant Morrison's Superman in a lot of ways: the adventurer who saw the potential for greatness in everyone he met.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"I don't understand that hand Ball mentality. It is just a tactical foul. You make a sacrifice for the team. Idk if this makes sense since I don't watch American sports but wouldn't it be like intentionally walking someone in baseball? It's no different to me than a keeper or last man bringing down an attacker. You know the negative consequences of your actions but the outcome overall is beneficial for the team. You sacrifice yourself, your team has to play a man down for the rest of the match, and the other team
gets a penalty. Seems fair to me. I'd prefer that 99 percent of the time as the attacking team. 

Suarez is a fighter, you get a lot of players from South America with the same mentality. They grow up in slums and for many the only way out is football. They do everything they can to get that little advantage. That's just the way it is. I would hate to play against suarez and i don't agree with a lot of his antics. But I can definitely understand why he is the way he is and I don't hold that against him. He seems like a genuinely nice guy off the pitch and that is what i care about. I think the whole biting incident is blown way out of proportion anyways only due to it's bizarre nature. I mean it is clearly unacceptable but I don't see how a bite that doesn't injure someone should get you a larger ban than a potentially career ending tackle.

true,justabitmoresonic,rory,Rory,"1) I think he should die in the middle of the episode or maybe towards the end just not at the very end. I think it is completely plausible because Clara must know he regenerates so there would be no wasted time in an explanation.

Someone down there said they want him to take Moffat with him. I don't know why, I would love to see Moffat do another Doctor. Changing the show runner and Doctor at the same time AGAIN would be a bit annoying I think. Plus I would like to see the showrunner change during a Doctor to see the difference.

2) I wouldn't mind his last words to be ""Geronimo"" because that's how he came in but I think the writers can think of something better. I know a lot of people didn't like the ""I don't want to go"", but the other day I saw a post on Tumblr that made me realise the whole ""allons-y/I don't want to go"" comparison which I thought was really good.

3)I think that having a companion there will influence the personality. He will hopefully be a bit more serious but still have the fun sort of like 10 I guess but perhaps still more on the alien side

She's not a whiny girl who doesn't really do much expect fall in love with the doctor, she was funny and interesting and very clever. Though yes, the plot could have been much, much better, and the episodes should really have had connection to each other.

The series honestly could have done well by having less rushed episodes, and maybe some two parters. This last episode was fine; I didn't hate it, I didn't love it. Yes, most of the episodes this season were a little too action-oriented but honestly I like it more than Classic's way of doing things. Seasons 2-6 were all great, because they all had overarching stories to a basic level and no episode seemed overly rushed. The first season didn't really know where it wanted to go, what it wanted to be- which you can't blame the writers for. They were taking a big step forward. This season, however, isn't in a similar situation. They could have delayed the season or something. They have plenty of fans to back them up if they did that.


This has been a disapointment, yes, but I'm hopeful for the 50th anniversary episode, and for the next season.

As I see the Ninth Doctor, that anger is always bubbling just below the surface. He puts on a cheerful/sarcastic veneer on the surface to keep the anger down, but it’s a very thin layer.

Those criticisms are things I’d say of the Eleventh Doctor, particularly in series 7 part 1 where he veers from angry and moody in A TOWN CALLED MERCY to bouncy and sympathetic in THE POWER OF THREE. Prior to those, he’s an absent-minded twit in DINOSAURS ON A SPACESHIP got quite dark — which I find hard to justify seeing as Ten was kinder to Dalek Sec, and he and the Cult of Skaro killed thousands of people too! If there was consistency across Series 5 and 6, it got completely reset in Series 7.

Going back to Ten for a moment, the comparison you made is a little unfair. We got to see what Ten was like before the loss of Rose in DOOMSDAY and what he was like after it in series 3. We could reconcile the two sides by the events of DOOMSDAY and potentially by how he talks about the Tylers in THE RUNAWAY BRIDE. We **can’t** see the Before image of Nine; all we see is how he behaves after meeting Rose in ROSE.

But I can’t identify any episodes where Nine seems to have no shared memories between personalities, particularly not between episodes.

I know that if by some chance we got Eriksen, he wouldn't be a reserve player, but I still put Gerrard ""ahead"" of him because he's the captain. I figured that Brendan could rotate midfielders to keep them fesh and to have at least one first team midfielder to run the show in cup games where we need a senior presence. Gerrard could benefit for some rest and Coutinho is bound to hit some poor form as he's only a kid still. Eriksen could slot in for either.

true,selorn,tennant,Tennant,"Race is one thing.   I can totally see a non-white guy hit the role out of the park.

I can also see a woman hitting it out of the park, too.

However, this is not a ""let's see how PC we can get"" contest.   IF there is a female or non-white person who hits the role out of park compared to the others...yeah, I'd be interested in seeing them onscreen.  

But, in the case of gender, interesting though the concept of a transgender Doctor is, I can only see it coming off as EXTREMELY gimmicky and distracting.   Contrary to what the OP says, I think it's very very cissexist(cis-ignorant?) to claim that just because the show isn't a giant metaphor for penises that the Doctor's gender isn't relevant to his character's identity.   Gender Identity is ALWAYS relevant to a character's identity.  Even a Time Lord's.

That's not sexism, or saying that women should do X and men should do Y.   That's just a basic fact that gender is an ingrained part of one's psyche.   And while the Doctor obviously has very limited control over his regenerations, he's shown an ability to apparently control the basic parameters(even if he worries about having two heads or something): a male humanoid.   In other words, he's seemed to have shown a preference for the male gender, and never shown any interest in changing genders(unless you want to REALLY stretch the whole ""Sue the transgender horse"" thing....).

Basically....no.   Just....no.

P.S.  I'd really like to see the episodes ""Terror of the Transphobic Psychiatrist,"" and ""Power of the Gendered Public Restrooms.""

If i don't display my ticket correctly or stay longer than i paid for i'm liable to be fined, a condition i accepted when buying a ticket and parking there. If one of the terms of renting the spaces is that they must be used for vehicles only (assuming it is of course, if not the owner will make it one now) then the owner is well within his rights to cancel the time remaining, tell you to leave and fine you for breaking the lease conditions, if you persist i'd imagine it becomes trespassing and a criminal matter; since he couldn't get them to leave he must have felt it was a matter for the police to handle and decided to ring them.

The owner sounded like he handled it badly, but not illegitimately, but then we only have the account of the people he was trying to shoo away so it's probably heavily biased to make him look like a massive bell-end.

I'd imagine all car parks will now start having vehicle only rules as a condition for renting space[s], if they didn't have already, to avoid this in future.

It's a nice idea but getting the proper permission of the land owner in advance would have made it better.

true,thezapzupnz,null,null,"Let’s take each moment in turn. Before we do, I should point out that where I think you talk about emotionlessness, I think it’s more a case of either a neutral expression (there’s no expression to deliver, because nothing is happening) or stoicism. After having read this, I still think you’re measuring the Ninth Doctor to the behavioural standards of Ten and Eleven (who were much more forthcoming with their feelings).

A war veteran is rarely forth-coming with his feelings. Anyway, let’s begin:

**In the beginning of the episode**: he has asked Rose where to go. When he eventually decides, he’s probably decided to go because it’s something neat to show off and will join in for a good time.

**Arriving at Platform One**: his « emotionlessness » is because there’s no reason to show emotion. He’s not distraught at the state of the Earth nor what’s about to happen to it because he already knows. There’s nobody there anymore anyway — he loved the people, not the rock, and the people have long since moved away. (It may be sadistic, but that’s nothing to do with the acting) — tl;dr there’s no reason for him to display anything other than neutral by this point.

**Joining the party**: since he’s here for a good time, why wouldn’t he be smiling? He’s got to put on the right face for the occasion, after all. As to the flirting, why wouldn’t the Doctor flirt? Eleven flirts. Ten did a bit but not much. It’s a good time! People! Species! A smiling trampoline getting Earth history wrong! *It’s fantastic!*

*At this point I’ll take an aside to ask why on Earth any negative emotions from the Time War should be showing here? He’s here for a good time, not to be a misery guts. He’s packed up his troubles in his old kit bag, he’s smiling, smiling, smiling — maybe for Rose’s sake. He’s not going to be an emotional wreck every time something happens.*

**17:11**: « This is who I am, right here, right now, alright? All that counts is here and now, and this is me! » — I’m not sure why you think he should be angry or why he should be angrier. He’s merely being firm; he wants to close the subject.

He then shuffles off to cool down. The tension is broken when Rose makes a joke. He’s reacting rather normally: I certainly don’t stay a bundle of dog poo and knives when I’m *not even angry*. He’s made his point, he’s had his huff. The tension is defused with the silly joke, so no need to continue being a p_ick, and he doesn’t continue being one. He’s grumpy, but not angry.

**Rose calls home**: more tension defusing with a silly little joke. What is he supposed to say? What is he supposed to do? Break down and cry? He’s only met Jackie yesterday, I don’t know what nostalgia he’s supposed to experience. Empathy I don’t know about, that doesn’t always have to be expressed. He’s just trying to keep the mood up; that’s how the Ninth Doctor always behaves, it’s his sarcastic wit which is very British, and very Northern.

**I just want to say how sorry I am**: yeah, that tear is a bit more expected — but it’s also more contextually appropriate. She had been talking about his origins for a good minute before it fell. Perhaps that was the first time anyone extended their shoulder out for him to cry on? A tear there makes sense.

A tear before, when nobody has even mentioned the Time War or been able to talk about the subject of who he is for more than 15 seconds is unexpected. That’s why his emotion came out with a bit of grumpiness, because that kind of frustration can indeed come out that way. Talking to Jabe was the catalyst, but that catalyst needed to exist for the emotion to express itself properly.

**It burned, just like the Earth**: I don’t expect there to be emotion at all here. It’s stoicism, pure and simple. His delivery is a perfect example of British understatement, and Northern stoicism in particular.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I’m not continuing this discussion to say that I think you’re wrong. I think the research you’ve made to make your post shows that you quite like this kind of discussion and so do I. That’s why I’m keeping it going. It’s fun, right? :-D

But I think perhaps you’re not accounting for a lot of things, particularly how strangely British/Northern the Ninth Doctor is. Northerners are famous for their stoicism, and a Northern war veteran would only be more so. When the wounds are so raw, you would put on as brave a face you could to keep the hurt from coming back — and it’d take something quite powerful to lower that defence.

Take DALEK, for instance, where the Doctor can’t help but revive his feelings of anger, hatred, and helplessness when faced with *the right kind of catalyst*: his mortal enemy.

...

&gt; Overthrowing Sadam to give the people freedom of democracy, to let the people build the country up into one similar to ours hasn't really worked out, sadly. I'll put this reason down to radical islam. People want Sharia law and it is holding them back. They're wanting to limit their own freedoms themselves.

Agreed.

If Iraq ends up a liberal democracy and that caused an Arab Spring movement that spread over the Arab world then invading Iraq would perhaps have been a good idea.

However there's no real sign of that happening. In Iraq we'll probably end up with either some sort of authoritarian regime or a civil war. The Arab Spring happened but we'll likely end up with theocracies or civil wars. Best case authoritarian regimes.

I.e. we've spent a load of cash and lost a bunch of soldiers and the best case is that we end up with the status quo ante bellum. 

Why is that? It's because the societies we're intervening in are sufficiently primitive that their stable states are civil war or tyranny. It's not like Eastern Europe post Cold War, or Germany or Japan post WWII where the society was advanced enough for democracy to be a stable state.

Since Rafa's sacking, on the back of this article I've been quietly optimistic José was going to come back. However, I recall there was something a bit more definitive than this about a new positive change - which aligns with the satisfaction you mention above - but this second reading comes across as a bit more ambiguous. May have been in a follow-up post somewhere... 

Key bit:

*""Going into the meeting, I could not understand the reasons why the club had dispensed with Roberto Di Matteo’s services and I was angry with our ludicrous policy of hiring and firing managers to the point of absurdity. After hearing the explanation for the brutal sacking – which again, I apologise for not being able to share publicly – my views of Roman and the board had softened.*

*And I felt very uncomfortable.*

*Had I fallen for the earnest and reasoned justification put forth by our owner and his, at times, quiet and shy demeanour? I wasn’t sure. I know that I didn’t feel right. I was surrounded by forty thousand disgruntled Chelsea supporters and yet my once strident set of opinions had been compromised by what I had heard in the meeting. I had to balance the two contrasting views. I’d like to think I am a fairly balanced person. I’d need time to fathom it all out.*

Bangladesh for example has the best record on women's rights and wellbeing in South Asia and outperforms her regional neighbours. Also I'd agree on the human rights front but the two Muslim countries with the worst record in human rights have been Syria under the secular Syrian Ba'athist regime and Iraq under the Iraqi Ba'athist party.

I've spoken to people who do that sort of job and the reason most of them are dicks (or appear to be) is because they constantly get the ""i was only running a few minutes late"" line every time they have to write a ticket, they just become hardened to it and learn to enforce the hard time limit than dick around and possibly lose their job for letting someone off.

I spoke to clamper who used to do the car park for my building and the only time they will stop doing a clamping (they'll still ticket) is if the car owner becomes physically violent, but that has it's own set of consequences for the car owner anyway.

I don't agree with clamping anyway, it's pure extortion in my opinion, it was a fixed £200 fine here for getting clamped and £700 if they towed it, i'm glad they stopped doing it here eventually.

I think that when it comes to what exams you have to sit, what you _have_ to study for hours every day, that choice should be down to the individual. For example I studied Double Maths and bio/chem/physics and now that I'm thinking of doing an interdisciplinary PhD the fact that I was able to take biology alongside physics is incredibly helpful at allowing me to pick up the extra stuff, whilst the maths was practically a requirement for doing well in physics.

I appreciate the benefit of the arts and have read a few, admittedly short, books and texts on philosophy. I have a greater interest towards more practical philosophy like ethics and politics (Hobbes and Rawls etc.) rather than Platonism and Nietzsche.

true,taitle,null,null,"&gt; I appreciate the benefit of the arts and have read a few, admittedly short, books and texts on philosophy. I have a greater interest towards more practical philosophy like ethics and politics (Hobbes and Rawls etc.) rather than Platonism and Nietzsche. But I think that kids can only study so many qualifications - so it's only fair to let them choose.

Hobbes and Rawls are great, but they are not really on a higher league or better practicality than Plato or Nietzsche.

Plato influenced Aristotle who influenced Alexander the Great, if you so flippantly call Plato impractical I can flippantly respond that without Plato or the whole Greek Movement that has driven societal progress (like in the renaissance) you would be in a cave eating plants.

Nietzsche as well, even though the idea everyone has in mind is a crazy useless proto-Nazi who announced that God was dead - his writing was sharp and his responses to thinkers like Kant were stunning. 


&gt;Although I suppose they could replace much of RE with Philosophy, as RE just seemed to be rote memorisation of various fairytales.

I think you are being a little simplistic, RE is a mixed bag as one school could be studying Philosophy and Ethics, while another could be studying Buddhism, Christianity or Islam and Ethics. You make it sound as if students around the country are learning how to recite all of King Solomon's wives, or how much Jacob hated Esau. By taking up this subject you are not simply studying a religion's 'fairy tales' but the underlying culture that makes such religions possible. 

For instance a study in Buddhism would make you appreciate or understand how a sect in one part of the world which is thigh deep in books and say something like Zen could be described as 'Buddhist.' It may not be as practical as Further Maths but it is on a par with something like English or History.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; When is the last time a gay Iraqi was killed for having gay sex behind closed doors? 

750 have been killed in 6 years, or about 2 per week.

http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57395105/emo-and-gay-kids-targeted-killed-in-iraq/

&gt; It's not clear why the killings have stepped up in recent months. Many Iraqis are religiously conservative and have struggled against the western influence that has infiltrated their once-closed society in the wake of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
&gt;
&gt; Like many places in the Muslim world, homosexuality is extremely taboo in Iraq. Anyone perceived to be gay is considered a fair target, and the perpetrators of the violence often go free. The militants likely behind the violence intimidate the local police and residents so there is even less incentive to investigate the crimes.
&gt;
&gt; Emo is short for ""emotional"" and in the West generally identifies teens or young adults who listen to alternative music, dress in black, and have radical hairstyles. Emos are not necessarily gay, but they are sometimes stereotyped as such.
&gt;
&gt; To Iraqis, ""Emo"" is widely synonymous with ""gay."" John Drake, an Iraq specialist for the British-based AKE security consulting firm, said Iraqi Emos are getting their hair cut so they aren't immediately identified, and therefore targeted, in the wake of the new threats.
&gt;
&gt; In the southern Baghdad neighborhood of Dora, a mostly-Sunni area, 35-year-old Hassan is afraid to leave his home. He plans on cutting his shoulder-length hair soon, but fears that his hormone-injected breast enhancements will be detected if he is stopped and patted down at one of the ubiquitous security checkpoints across the city.
&gt;
&gt; ""Today I went out of my house with a friend but we were severely harassed — some people told us that we need the double blocks,"" said Hassan, referring to the cement blocks that attackers use to beat people. ""I was scared so we returned home to hide.""
&gt;
&gt; Hassan's friend, a man who identified himself as 26-year-old Mustafa, called the recent hate crimes ""the strongest and deadliest campaign against us.""
&gt;
&gt; Hassan said he is gay but does not consider himself an Emo. He and Mustafa agreed to talk on condition that only their first names be used for fear they would be attacked if identified.
&gt;
&gt; One of Hassan's friends, Saif Raad Asmar Abboudi, was beaten to death with concrete blocks in mid-February in a case that terrified gay Iraqis and panicked human rights watchdogs. ""I feel very sorry for him,"" Hassan said.
&gt;
&gt; A Feb. 18 police report all but closes the case on Saif's killing. It shows an initial investigation was completed and ""the reason for the incident is unknown at the moment because the criminal is unknown.""
&gt;
&gt; An Interior Ministry official said 58 young people have been killed across Iraq in recent weeks by unidentified gangs who accused them of being, as he described it, Emo. Sixteen were killed in Sadr City alone, security and political officials there said. Nine of the men were killed by bludgeoning, and seven were shot. No arrests have been made.
&gt;
&gt; All officials spoke on condition of anonymity, as did many of the people interviewed for this article, in fear of violent reprisals.
&gt;
&gt; The Quran specifically forbids homosexuality, and Islamic militias in Iraq long have targeted gays in what they term ""honor killings"" to preserve the religious idea that families should be led by a husband and a wife. Those who do not abide by this belief are issued death sentences by the militias, according to the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq, a human rights watchdog group. The same militias target women who have extramarital affairs.
&gt;
&gt; ""There is a strong wave of campaigns by clerics against homosexuals now,"" said Ali al-Hilli, chairman of Iraqi LGBT, a human rights group based in London that provides two safe houses in Iraq for gays. ""The police do not provide protection for them.""
&gt;
&gt; He said an estimated 750 gay Iraqis have been killed because of their sexual orientation since 2006.",0,1370266063,null,0,false,0,cab87vb,t3_1fiijy,t1_cab87vb,t1_cab5n4d,null,1430942563,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

2) IMO, Siggy was much better at the end of the season than people were giving him credit for. When he was able to play behind the striker, which is his actual position, he performed very well. I'm more than comfortable starting next season with him in that role.

Certain aspects of our laws probably work, the requirements for safe keeping and who gets them I'm sure reduce the possibility of them getting into the wrong hands. Certain aspects of our laws seem to have not worked, the pistol and semi auto ban saw massive increases in gun crime ( [Source](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/62993000/gif/_62993691_firearms_offences_624gr.gif) )a trend that is now falling after many years however (seemingly with all other types of crime). 

But regarding if it works, as I said its impossible to claim because people aren't even on the same page when debating. A person who views firearms as a tool that is a privilege to use in society vs somebody who views it as a god given right are going to have different goals, views and aims . 

You have reduced legal ownership to 0 and gun crime is low/non existent. Some people would consider that a success some people would consider the loss of what they perceive to be a god given right a failure regardless of the statistics. 

There is a whole ideological side to US ownership which make it more complex that mere (and debatable) stats.

The highest in series 7 have both been Christmas episodes. Setting those aside, Bells of St. John had 8.44 million viewers in the UK.

In series 6, Impossible Astronaut had 8.66.

In series 5, Eleventh Hour, with a new Doctor, 10.085. Call that a new Doctor fluke, and we're down to The Time of Angels with 8.59.

in the Specials, End of Time Part 2 had 12.27, a last episode, so also kinda special.  So Waters of Mars with 10.32?

Series 4, Journey's End, 10.57

Series 3, Smith and Jones, 8.71

Series 2, Tooth and Claw, 9.24

Series 1, Rose (new Doctor), 10.81, so Unquiet Dead 8.86.

So throwing out Christmas episodes, when there's not much competition for viewers on Christmas day, and setting aside special events like Tennant's last or Smith's first, overall, yes, the highest number of viewers for an episode has been in steady decline since Series 4.

From my perspective I have a Master's Degree and 8 years experience in industry - I don't put down anything about A-Levels or GCSEs on my CV. I would find it extremely odd if they asked my actual GCSE results - kind of demeaning to the experience I'm bringing.

Most importantly it suggests that HR are in charge of recruitment and not engineers.

Yeah, one of the issues that's been popping up in Manchester is 'Zombie' car parks, that is to say people just using derelict space for car parking. Doesn't sound too bad initially, but it seems that some of it may be unsafe and the companies involved don't always seem to get planning permission in advance and so on.  That means things like disabled access, signs, lighting and all that jazz could be substandard or absent and obviously no-one takes into account the impact on the local area and roads etc.. which the planning process would do.

There isn't any evidence this is because of Gun availability, it seems to me it isn't too hard to get a gun in Australia (my Grandad had a shotgun here in the uk). Some countries just have a higher murder rate. Japan has a very low crime rate in general for example, as does Switzerland (maybe it's poverty based). Ireland has a lot of gun ownership, but the same murder rate as England.
If you are not looking at the overall murder rate, just the rate of mass shootings, then they don't occur at a high enough frequency to give anything but a misleading hint at a more random pattern.

I don't really believe a gun defends a person from the state. But I could see it defending you from a home intruder - but I think this is the 'vivid fallacy', that a dog and motion based porch light is all you really need.

The first table is based on fair assumptions, and I think is a good guide to our retirement. For the second table I plugged in a return of 9%, which is what our parents have averaged in the run up to their retirement.

To me this shows just how easy our parents generation had it, 5%-10% got them to retirement at 65-55. Now we are going to have to save 15%-20% to get the same kind of outcome. At 5% you are going to be working till you die.

There is a massive shortfall in what people are saving and what they need to be saving.

Ty. My point stands though; arguing over local parking charges is more or less the definition of bureaucratic pettiness.

Whether the NSS decided to do it themselves, or if they used a locals complaint as an excuse, doesn’t change that; it’s a daft thing to waste money and the courts time over. Are they a group which stands watch over the separation of the state from religious influence, or a bunch of militant atheists looking to pick fights with religion wherever they can?

I don’t see the faith school issue as being very analogous; its arguable that giving money from a state budget as a subsidy is rather different to exempting a charity from (what is essentially) a local tax. It’s not even clear if this is any kind of prejudice. Have other community charities applied for similar licences, and been turned down on the grounds that they are not religious institution’s?

I think that if the NSS started up one of those Humanist Churches in the area, and were refused parking permits, they’d have an argument I’d support. As it is however…

Edit: Actually though, surely a case study is still a bit anecdotal?

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;But if its an Ad-Hoc car park, you don't often need planning permission. Temporary structures are treated differently.

That isn't the case as far as I am aware and I'm a little intrigued as to where you are getting this idea..  

If it's just from the linked company, you may want to read the entry again.  And probably the referenced legislation, essentially, you can as they say use ""our car parks in circumstances where they are required temporarily in connection with building works"".  The legislation states:

  *The provision on land of buildings, moveable structures, works, plant or machinery required temporarily in connection with and for the duration of operations being or to be carried out on, in, under or over that land or on land adjoining that land.*

So yeah, you don't need planning permission to build temporary structures required to assist in building work, or for staff for that building work (and porta-cabins etc..).  When you change the use of a site from a pub (or a house, or offices) to a car park and make it available to the public I am very much under the impression that you are.  


On that note, you will find lots of planning applications that include requests to have a (time limted) period where a site is used as a car park before redevelopment

About the only temporary car parking that doesn't seem to need consent is that for specific events, on private land where it is used as something else most of the time (like a field...).

&gt;Also I know (because a friend bitched about arranging it) that you can get such insurance for 1 day events, in a field.

You can get liability insurance (I've done it..) for single day events, but if you are running a temporary car park that would be a stupidly expensive way to approach it.  You will also note that most car parks disclaim pretty much everything bar negligence (because you can't...), so I assume they don't actually need much in the way of special or comprehensive insurance, I very much doubt that they have anything that covers the activities of third parties on their land.  I assume they have legal and public liability cover, but that's about it.  

Now the question would be whether putting in a car park, without planning, potentially without it meeting whatever standards are laid out for car parks, whether they would be covered for any serious issue (where someone bothered to check the state of the car park).  That said, this car park is at least just a patch of flat ground (looking at it..) whilst some of the previous ones that have been picked up have had all sorts of additional issues that presumably would be a risk.",0,1370278147,null,0,false,0,cabbz9g,t3_1fjsv4,t1_cabbz9g,t1_cabbg2p,null,1430940790,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think that suggests that they might both actually be happy and the issues they had have long since been overcome. It seems more likely to me that Mou actually chose to leave Chelsea originally because of his disagreements. That makes it much easier to come back rather than actually having a contract terminated by one of the parties.

Emenalo will probably be the least happy of the Chelsea heirarchy but then he is a glorified scout and on the way to losing his job.

Now what I would consider swallowing his pride is selling Torres. Roman has splashed his cash to bring us 2 of the top 10 of the most expensive forwards ever but both have, to all intensive purposes, flopped. I understand Roman bought Torres because he'd chased him since his Athletico days and will have been pissed that he didn't come to Chelsea instead of Liverpool originally despite offering a better contract and a better transfer deal to Athletico, but I think it's time to give up with him now.

Oh wow. A guy arguing for gay marriage said people, regardless of gender, should not only have equality in marriage before the law but before ""God"" as well and is spouting loads of Christian rhetoric. This should not be part of our legal system, and is not how marriage equality should be handled. Religious marriage (holy matrimony, before God) should be legally separated from state marriage (all the legal rights).

Edit: This is stupid. Makes me feel like I am living in a theocracy. Well, I am atheist. If the law is going to be defined by a debate on Christianity, maybe I should move to a different country. Or maybe, if a enough of the population agree, religion should be removed from the legal process.

Edit 2: More religious debate. Defining marriage as a framework for reproduction. I am so disappointed.

Edit 3: Wow. That old woman in the black and white patterned shirt is disgusting. False arguments based around strawmen and emotion, and defining the law by Christianity. This country really is still a (partial) theocracy. And now an old man saying immigrants will get fake gay marriages to be able to stay in the country. These are not valid arguments. Why aren't they laughed out of the House of Lords? Logical fallacies and religion. Something should happen to create full separation of church and state.

Edit 4: Even the gay guy making a good argument had to preface it with ""I am a Christian, hence..."", which is pretty much ""I am a Christian (honest), but...""

Edit 5: Oh, neat. This next guy said that, while he doesn't support gay marraige, he doesn't think it is the place of the non-democratic House of Lords to veto majority votes by the democratically elected House of Commons. Good. I hope that argument is embraced by the House and they don't block this. However, I equally hope that this same argument eventually results in the dissolution of the House of Lords.

Although with that being said, the are 2 interesting stories you can take with this character if you make the Doctor Female.

The first one is a Female Doctor who isn't the Doctor but rather a female companion who grabs his title while he in the midst of his darkest period as the beast, the storm, and the Valyard. This way you introduce a female Doctor while keeping continuity consistent. 

The next option you can go is if the Doctor regenerates into a female.

I think John Hurt (from the rumors I've been hearing) is the ACTUAL 9th Doctor and did something so horrendous to end the Time War that The Doctor chose to make himself forget about it (Making Eccelston 10, Tennant 11 and Smith 12). That would be awesome.

Chris O'Dowd would be the BEST choice, but since he is in a show right now as the lead (Family Tree) prolly not gonna happen. Also Jim none of those I chose are American. They are all British or Scottish.

Martin Freeman is doing Sherlock WITH Moffat which is why I thought that could really, really work.

Billy Connolly as The Doctor would just blow my mind (same with Sheen) but they are too big of stars to do the show I think.

Ben Whishaw is prolly the most accurate choice up there, but I dunno. I heard rumors of there maybe being a chick Doctor. They are saying Olivia Colman (PC Doris Thatcher from HOT FUZZ) is up for it because she is a BIG commodity in England right now. 

They are also saying James Corden is a big name up there, but it might be weird considering he was James Corden during Matt Smith's reign and that could be confusing.

Eddie Izzard would ALSO be an amazing choice - but again he is too big and busy of a star to play it methinks.",0,1370281747,null,0,false,0,cabdb6g,t3_1fhbuk,t1_cabdb6g,t3_1fhbuk,null,1430940164,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It would kill the dynamic of the show, and it will never happen because Doctor Who is the BBC's highest-rated show and they won't take a risk like that.

&gt;I'm tired of the patriarchy being laced throughout Doctor Who, we need female characters and that's the end of it.

In case you haven't noticed, there's always been female characters on Doctor Who.  They just haven't played the Doctor.

true,Mr_Rivers,null,null,"Honestly this is just a gesture. I feel, with my limited knowledge, it will do little to nothing to help food poverty. 

The main problem of getting food to starving people is not securing the food, but finding ways to get it to where it needs to go.  Most countries with starving populations have incredibly poor infrastructure, so much so that most lorries and conventional transport for food is next to impossible. This is why you see air drops of food in remote parts of africa. Think about how innefficient that is. 

It might sound heartless, but to simply feed these people is pointless. You are being kind in the short run in order for them to live, create more children, and perpetuate the problem. 

These countries don't need food. What they need is a sustainable infrastructure in order for the abundance of food we have to reach them cheaply and efficiently. Diverting resources away from starving people into road building may seem evil, but it will save a hell of a lot of lives in the long run. 

Either that, or some bright person needs to build an all-terrain lorry which can reach the most difficult places in the world where people live, then get the funding for a few thousand of them.

There is an old adage that says the worst slave owners were the ones who were kind to their slaves. Why? Well, if you see slaves who are well treated, well fed and not beaten, you are less likely to abolish slavery. It perpetuates the problem. 

I feel the same kind of thinking can be applied to food agencies. Their funding should be spent building roads so that food can be distributed. Yes, some will die in the short term, but it will save so many more lives in the long run. That, and once the famines stop, the country will have the infrastructure remaining to actually do something good with their country.

Edit: I realise this article is about mostly UK stuff, I kind of just wanted to rant

The problem is, pictures of starving babies being fed makes more money than pictures of roads being built. It's the reason I don't donate to food agencies, I feel like I am throwing away my money. Again, it seems horrible, but for every baby that gets fed, there is another one that dies of malnutrition. That baby grows up, and has another three babies itself.

Coady is a great leader, I just dont think he can lead a team with Champions League ambitions. He could be a decent back-up though.

true,shofixtireborn,null,null," I like the idea that John hurt is a future regeneration of the doctor (perhaps the final incarnation) that represents the future the doctor is running from, but not the past.  Running from the future would be something intrinsic to a timelord in the vein of the doctor.  In this case he isn't running from what he has done, but what he will do.  His goals and rules all stem from trying to become a better being, do the right thing, and ultimately prevent becoming this incarnation of the doctor.  This running from who he will become will eventually become this darker incarnation of the doctor whom for all intents and purposes rejects the goals and principles that he has embodied since he stared into the schism.  Like the master who was manipulated by the time lords using the schism, the doctor is also being driven toward this end.  Perhaps all the compassion, all of the doing right, all of the following of the rules, all of the rejection by the different beings who he is trying to help (mainly humanity) are the catalyst for this great act of peace that John hurt mentions in the ""name of the doctor"".   All the running will lead him toward this end anyways. 

In regards to the history of the time war, because time is not linear for the doctor it is impossible to speculate when the time war was actually ended.  We have been told multiple endings to the scenarios in play surrounding the end of the time war.  The ninth doctor would have us believe that it was over.  Then rose battled the Dalek emperor which supposedly ended the time war.  Daleks came back, Time lords came back--All defeated.  We see the wreckage of the Tardis all caused by the silence.  We cannot assume that the final acts of the time war have even been committed.  For a being like the doctor the acts that are yet to happen maybe as much a part of the past as they are the future.  Remember time is not linear and the future of the doctor often reflects the past of the universe (pompeii is a prime example).",0,1370287035,null,0,1370287533,0,cabfarw,t3_1fkxk8,t1_cabfarw,t3_1fkxk8,null,1430939154,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I studied both philosophy as a separate subject and the critical thinking course, and they are vastly different. The critical thinking course contains no philosophy, you don't learn about Plato and Nietzsche and the meaning of life, you learn about why you shouldn't take drugs and how to write essays properly, it's a course to prepare you for university.

true,PancakeDoomsday,lfc12,,"He had a great season at struggling Aston Villa, but it's difficult, perhaps impossible, to presently know how he'd do with us. Obviously we can't expect him or really anyone we'd bring in to have the impact Suarez has had, but still a few questions arise:

Would he be the focus of attack? How will he do if he's not? 

I'm not terribly familiar with him either, can he play across the front 3? That seems necessary. Interchanging positions is fundamental to our attack. Does Benteke need to be the striker or can he play support for Sturridge/someone?

Was this past season a fluke? Now that he's known in the EPL defenders will be giving him a bit extra. How will he respond?

Lastly, how much will he cost? He's a recent purchase for Aston Villa, no? Selling him at 22 within the League - I can't imagine Aston Villa will let him go cheaply; they'd probably demand more than they actually value him at, I'd suspect.

&gt; Cambridge University law student here. This was indeed a real paper, sat by the first years on 1 June 2013.
Bear in mind I’m a third year, so I haven’t revised this topic in years, but focusing on the defences:

&gt;(i) raises issues of consent, and whether the identity of the person doing the sucking (i.e. male/female) is enough to vitiate consent, and therefore make it a sexual offence.

&gt;(ii) wants you to discuss whether the fact that he later enjoys it is relevant. I’d argue that he wasn’t consenting at the time when he was penetrated (he was being held down), so it’s irrelevant. However, the position might be different in a “rape fantasy” context, which is a problem question I was set for a supervision once.

&gt;(iii) is another consent point – generally you can’t consent to harm above “actual bodily harm” (ABH), which is relatively minor, so there’s a question of whether the harm caused is in fact grievous bodily harm (GBH, more serious than ABH). There are also certain exceptions to this consent principle, such as “rough horseplay”, so there’s the issue of whether you can make the waxing and general “shenanigans” fit within the scope of one of these recognised defences to the offence of ABH/GBH.

&gt;The offences probably won't mean a great deal to non-UK lawyers, but the main thing of interest is that there's no rape here. The UK definition specifically requires penetration with a penis, so (ii) is probably assault by penetration. There's also a causation issue in (iii) regarding whether Richard's failure to get help is what caused his death, rather than the waxing/ABH/GBH - if there's no causation, there's no manslaughter.

Yet RDM failed to go after a single striker in the 2012 summer window. I mean yes, blame Emenalo, but what good is a manager if he can't make his needs felt or heard? We lost in the group stages, made a United 3rd tier side look like Barca in the FA cup, and in the league just were not clicking for all the class that we possessed last year. I think Rafa was a great stopgap manager, no matter how badly he is hated at Stamford Bridge. You cannot deny that he worked with all he had, and did a splendid job in the end from the available resources.

And as Amy was introduced as an assertive and flirtatious young woman, her making a pass at him wasn't really shocking. But consumed? Come on, now. She had conflicting feelings which eventually got prioritized and resolved.

As for the other ladies, well. I *think* I get your point? That here are women who, as already stated, have had the Doctor become a central figure in their lives, and as the Doctor has a habit of eating away at pre-existing support networks (family, lovers, etc), it's easy to depend on him utterly, to get wound up in the excitement and adventure. Compound that with RTD's fondness for romance and Moffat's for making the Doctor the most absolute thing of importance in the universe, and yeah, okay, I get it. But that is leagues away from being a damsel in distress. I notice you left Donna off your list, as an example. And Clara is described as being there solely to support the Doctor, yet upthread you mentioned that all women are portrayed as the damsel in distress.

As the doctor says ""I'm from the north! lots of planets have a north"" doesn't mean they all act the same. I guess my problem is with his general stoicness. Though I'm fine with him being stoic... he's NOT. happy, angry, sad. He goes through all of it. 

re: Joining the party. Sure I don't expect him to be miserable. He chose the destination. but no nostalgia or anything. the thought of watching your own planet destroyed, then bringing someone else to watch theirs being destroyed he's just smiling. If he were trying to hide his emotions his face would clench up a bit. I'm not saying he should be an emotional wreck but he should show a little reluctance. 

re:This is who I am. Right here. Right now. Actually by your standards I'd expect him NOT to lose his temper. considering everything else he's supposed to be holding back. Reluctant, secretive, pretend to be mysterious. If it doesn't hurt to see another world destroyed, it shouldn't bring up this much emotion just from asking where hes from. This is exactly what I mean by him going up and down. I EXPECT him to make the silly joke and defuse the situation. I don't expect him to start yelling at her for asking if he's able to keep up the rest of it and smile and enjoy himself just minutes before. 

@Rose calling home. Again he doesn't need to break down crying. Lil nostalgia for his lost people, staring off at earth with maybe a slight frown is what I would expect. Just not a grin on his face. especially after he lights up at the mere MENTION of where he's from. 

@I just want to say how sorry I am: Now hes off to the other end of the spectrum. Was ""angry"" now sad. Eyes watering up would have been fine. A single tear seems a little overreaction especially for a stoic trying to hide his feelings. It certainly didn't have to be public though I assume he considers Jabe a friend, I'd expect him to ""get distracted"" by something else and try to hide it. If 2 comments about where hes from make him cry.. he's really not much of a stoic. 

@burned just like earth. Yes. This is more of what I'd expect from a stoic. But not after the 2 previous ""mentions"" The first makes him ""firm"" (though the fact he raised his voice to me says frustration/anger more than firm). Then the second makes him CRY. The third and hes finally got his emotions in check? I'd at least expect a slight frown. 

So no.. I'm not measuring him to the same emotional standards as 10 or 11. I'm measuring them to himself. 3 reactions to the same discussion I'd have at LEAST expected the 3rd first, then the first, then the second in that order. To me him crying at the second mention already means he's not much of a stoic. I DO expect him to keep a brave face, and be the sly Doctor he is by sidestepping questions. I DON'T expect him to be raising his voice or crying.

liberal country that's taken a very different turn, thanks to
democracy.  There is little restraint on the power and size of the
government and its ability to protect the interests of its favoured
clients.

The favoured clients are those groups capable of organising in their
own interests, mainly professions, bureaucracies, big business and
finance, and some unions.  We can expect these groups to retain the
stranglehold they have on the UK's economy.  The disfavoured groups
are those that cannot organise effectively, if at all; consumers, the
unemployed and poor, people in the 'precariat'.  For them, things will
continue to worsen.

The sclerosis is going to continue, slowly worsening, because it seems
unlikely that any democracy can reform its way out of it.  It might
turn out that, as the viability of the country comes into question,
the favoured groups might intensify their looting while the looting is
good, hastening the arrival of whatever is to follow.  Or maybe
popular discontent will propel some 'strong leader' into power; there
are precedents.

The least likely outcome is the popular election of a government that
will dismantle the privileges of the various distributional
coalitions.  Such a government would allow the normal mechanisms of
trade and the market to flourish, as they always will when not
obstructed.  This is almost inconceivable because both 'enlightened'
opinion and the public, insofar as they have discernible views,
continue to see government coercion as the response to all problems.

A food bank needs a reliable supply of reasonably balanced and healthy food.

Asda are offering things which have been over-supplied, and which the supplier can't even be bothered to take back.

So, on any given day, it is completely random whether anything is available, it is completely random what that thing is, but it will probably be something cheap, there will probably be a large batch of the same thing, and it will probably be close to its sell by date.

Sure if Asda put this stuff on their shelves at a nominal price, it might do some people some good. But from the food banks point of view, it might turn out to be more trouble than it is worth.

He's never finished higher than 15th (I think) whereas worse Wigan sides have finished higher. He plays attacking football, but defensively, his sides have been atrocious, and while he has bought some good attacking players, some of his defensive buys have been shocking. We've got an ageing defence at the moment, and I feared who he'd bring in if he was the man to replace the likes of Distin and Jagielka in a few years.

As for being, ""Classy"", and, ""Punching above his weight"", he got his side relegated, it's very hard for me and many other blues to look past that.

Despite that, I've always said I'd get behind the man as much as any other Evertonian, I want nothing more than for Roberto to prove how I was wrong to doubt him.

Every club will have its doubters when a new man is appointed, and that fact is no different here. I can see positives in his appointement as well, the experience, the bigger budget, the better players, the potential buys from Wigan (McManaman, Maloney, Kone, McCarthy, McCarthur), and now that he's the manager of our football team, I'm going to put all of my faith into the man!

That we have been around for a very long time and this is just a blip compared to the shite we've managed to get through in the past. Yes I know we've done some awful things too.

There's only so far we can be pushed. The poster who mentioned about previous generations pavement stomping and raging on the streets until the government were fucking terrified, that can and will happen again if we're pushed far enough. I can pretty much guarantee that! Not saying that's a good or bad thing either but it does give me hope in a strange way - we are certainly NOT a pacified or brainwashed population, nor have we ever been.

We have a very distinct culture and as much as people seem to think it's being destroyed, from my perspective (and others I have spoken to who are not British) it's only getting stronger and more influential.

The NHS, our eccentrics, our music deserves another mention, our education system, the fact that we're still some of the luckiest people in the world. 

I know that if the shit were to really hit the fan for any of us, ALL of us know someone who would do everything they could do to help us get back on our feet.

And finally my fellow Brits, everything above wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for a collective mindset. I don't think we're divided in the slightest :)",0,1370291430,null,0,false,0,cabh0z1,t3_1fldig,t1_cabh0z1,t3_1fldig,null,1430938341,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I definitely feel this some days! I do quite often have conflicting views with the religious people in the company. But thankfully none of them are the ""my way, or the highway"" types (at least not in person!). There's 3 atheists in the company, and 7 Christians. They're more than willing to discuss their religious views, but similarly listen to our views on things too - not that they'd change their views, but they are willing to listen, which is good. 

The only time I've really strongly disagreed with some opinions was when two people announced they were anti gay marriage, one girl said she'd signed a petition against it, too. I was upset with that, because to me gay marriage shouldn't even be a thing that needs debating over - love is love after all.

Oh, and one person believed dinosaurs weren't real. The fossils etc were left by God as a test of faith for us...yeah, I had a tough time hearing that. 

But yeah, they're a nice group, and the office atmosphere is very relaxed and stuff. I often forget that I work for a religious company, until I'm working away and realise 'Leviticus' or something is staring at me from the screen.

It's interesting that you mention about the church taking you on for being an atheist. The atheists of the company have recently been told that it'd be really good if we could publish some articles from an atheists perspective on the site. Invoke some genuine discussion, share some extra viewpoints etc, rather than everything being Christian all the way.

Just so you know, when somebody is sanctioned on Jobseeker's Allowance, you can still receive something called ""Hardship Provision"" *through* Jobcentre Plus.

It's not a loan and you don't have to pay it back or anything like that. You can still get paid at a reduced rate of 20% or 40% depending on your circumstances.

The Local Authority still treat it as Jobseeker's Allowance so will pay Housing and Council Tax Benefit for the period that Hardship Provision is paid for as well.

Go into your Jobcentre and ask for a form called a **JSA10.** They're normally processed within 48 hours.

You also have the right to *appeal* against the decision, but I would start by putting in a *reconsideration* against the Sanction first of all, which normally has a quicker result from the decision maker. To do this, ask for the form **DR7.**

Please apply for the Hardship Provision as soon as you can. It's something, at least. Good luck.

CHELSEA TV EXCLUSIVE: MOURINHO - THE FIRST INTERVIEW
Chelsea TV this evening (Monday) broadcast the first interview with Jose Mourinho after he was appointed manager earlier in the day.
Among the many subjects discussed were his emotions on returning, his aims, his development as a manager, his staff and the Chelsea squad and supporters.
Here is the Chelsea TV interview in full:
Welcome back, how are you?
I’m very happy. I had to prepare myself not to be too emotional for my arrival at the club but obviously I’m very happy.
How big a decision was it for you? It’s not common for managers to go back.
It was an easy decision. I met the boss, the owner, and I think within five minutes after some short and pragmatic questions we decided straight away. I asked the boss do you want me back, and the boss asked me do you want to come back, and in a couple of minutes the decision was made.
It worked out well in a way for both parties before. While you left and did what you wanted to do, Chelsea have continued to win things and built on what you did. 
It was a difficult moment, September 2007, because I love it here and I have a big connection with the club, and also for the club it wasn’t easy. But if you analyse it in a cool way, emotions apart, it was fantastic because my career after that, I had everything I was aiming for in my career. I wanted to win the grand slam, to win in England, Spain and Italy. I did it. I got all the trophies in three countries. I got my second Champions League too.
I enjoy being in different countries, in different football cultures, and I think it’s important for my evolution as a manager and a football coach, and Chelsea Football Club got important trophies after that and had important moments in the history of the club. Now we are back together and we are getting together at a great moment for us both, so I think we are ready to marry again and be happy and successful.
What’s the plan now?
The plan is always the same, evolution and to establish the club at the highest possible level. I left Chelsea in 2007, since then I’ve spoken about the club many times, especially in my privacy. I remember the day we went to the United States in 2004 pre-season. We had open training sessions with only a couple of kids watching the sessions, nobody was following the team. It was the beginning of Roman and his second season I suppose was the beginning of Chelsea. After that Chelsea started winning the Premier League, for the first time and then the second time, and after that when we went back to the United States we found a completely different situation around the club.
I can imagine now especially after the Champions League, that was the highest point of the club’s history, that this is now a bigger club. The social mass around the club is much bigger.
I am the same, physically the same, but every day you have to think about yourself, especially the manager, and about the evolution. I have the same nature but I’m much more mature with a different approach to things, I’m more ready to be in a club and stay for a long time.
Normally you haven’t spent a lot more than about three years with a club so you are saying this is longer-term building?
I hope so. When you look at the profile of the Chelsea squad I think it’s what they need at this time. If you look from my time, there are around four or five boys and these are the older ones - very important for this football club and very important for the balance of the squad, but it’s a young squad with a lot of talent and I think they need stability to reach a high point of their evolution and for their careers. They need stability, stability I hope I can give them and between me, the owner and of course the club, we have no doubts about what we want to do and the approach we want to have. I’m very confident I can help the team and help the boys to develop.
I feel myself not just as the Chelsea manager, because this is the first time in my career that I’ve arrived at a club that I already love. Normally I love the club a couple of years after I am there. Of course I go to a club, I wear the shirt and I feel the shirt with the crest and I give everything I have to do it, but this is the first time where I love it already. To be at the same time a Chelsea fan and a Chelsea manager is a new feeling for me and it’s a fantastic feeling.
You have a head start with the fans as you are already popular.
I know I am and I know at this football club there is a culture for the fans to be loyal to somebody who gave. When I watch a Chelsea match on TV and I see, for example, a banner which says Didier Drogba, that’s fantastic, and it makes Chelsea a special club.
I know they have a special feeling for me. I played against Chelsea with Inter and it was difficult because I was feeling it wasn’t a normal situation for me, and I think the people in the stands felt the same as me, so I belong to them and they belong to me. 

I think they know my nature, and they know I’m not coming here to sleep on what I did in the past and be comfortable just because we have a great feeling and we have a great relationship. Probably the first day I put my foot in Stamford Bridge again they will sing my name, but I’m not that kind of person and professional. I’m very demanding of myself. I need of course their support but I want to start from ground zero, I need to work hard again and build a different team from the team I built in the past. I want to give everything I can to the club, to the owner and to the fans, forgetting a little bit that I was a champion here. I want to have that pressure on myself like it is the first time I am here and I have to work hard to make sure they have a reason to be happy with me.
 

 
In the past six years you won the treble with Inter and had one incredible season in the league with Real Madrid. You say you are more mature now, how do you assess your development since you’ve been away from us?
Italy was something I wanted very, very much to do. Italian football is for sure the most tactical one, very difficult, especially if you are a team that wants to win, competing against teams that don’t want to lose. It was a big challenge for me.
I arrived in a club where there was an atmosphere of frustration because they couldn’t succeed in the Champions League and we got that trophy and for the first time in Italian football the treble. It helps me a lot to be more cultural. After Portugal and England I went to football with a different perspective. It was a big challenge for me, I had to challenge myself a lot and to study a lot. I think I became a better manager living in Inter.
I went to Madrid because I wanted to try to do the grand slam, the three most important championships in the world, and also because twice I had the chance to go to Real before, and I never did it because I decided to stay at Chelsea. The last one was the day after we won the FA Cup final at Wembley, and I thought “no way, I am going to stay”. The third time I wanted to go, I wanted another culture and another club with a worldwide dimension in terms of social approach and it was a fantastic experience for me. I think it was really important to get it in this period I call the last step of my formation as a manager. I’ve just turned 50 now and just finished my lap around European football. This experience in Madrid was fantastic because culturally it was hard, it was difficult. Portuguese and Spanish, and Spanish and Portuguese, and Real Madrid, a special club in a season where they have elections for the presidency, lots of politics around.
Last year we beat the record and got 100 points and 121 goals. This season everybody was focused on the Champions League. We reached the semi-finals and we all know, especially in this club, that semi-finals are a critical moment where you need that click to do it.
In our club there’s the semi-final we lost on penalties against Liverpool; the semi-final we lost with Guus Hiddink against Barcelona. You have the semi-final that took us to the final when we won with Roberto [Di Matteo], and we know in the Champions League semi-final you need that click. We [Real Madrid] didn’t have that click and couldn’t get the 10th European Cup that was an ambition for the club, but it was a fantastic experience for me and I think I arrived in my club, in my Chelsea, in the best moment of my career - of my stability as a manager, my stability as a person - always with my incredible family supporting me. I think I arrived in my best moment ready to give everything I have to try to make the club happy.

It seemed towards the end you lost your smile a little but in Madrid, but you’re happier now?
I’m not happy, I am very happy. As I was saying I was preparing myself in the last couple of days to control emotions, to come here in a cool way but I’m really emotional. I try to hide it a little bit but I am so happy and so proud because I think when you return to a place it is for some reason, not just because you have good results in the past or because the fans like you very much, it’s also because as a human point of view you left something here. People know the person I am, I kept a fantastic relationship with the owner and the club, and it’s something that makes me proud to be back. Not just because of the professional I am, I believe also because of the person I am.
The top three clubs in England will all be under new management next season. It is a very exciting time.
I think the Premier League is the Premier League. This season in terms of the Champions League, which is normally a thermometer of world football, I think English football was too early outside the competition. People were speaking about the level of the Premier League moving down comparing it with other countries, but I don’t believe so much on that. Sometimes things happen and there are no really firm reasons. I still think the Premier League is a fantastic competition and I don’t know but I believe there will be five or six teams very strong. In my time here in 2004 it was more about us, Man United and Arsenal, and after that a gap to the other teams. In this moment I think you can put five or six teams in the same plan, aiming at the start to reach the Champions League spots which is very difficult, and with more ambition to win the Premier League, and so the competition will be fantastic. I hope I can beat the competition.
Will the Premier League be the priority?
We have to improve the team, and when I say improve the team people are already thinking about how many millions Chelsea are going to spend, and when I say improve the team I am saying improving by work. My work has to improve players and improve the team. If I don’t do that I am not happy with myself. If after that we can improve the team by buying a couple of players it is fantastic but I have to improve the team and the players with my work. That’s a priority, improve. 

In the last two years you were struggling in the Premier League. If you didn’t win the Champions League you would be out of the Champions League this year. This year you had to fight until the last match to qualify. We have to try of course to improve, but the priority in a club that reached the level is exactly that - improve individually, improve collectively and improve the structure of the club around the football team, and try to win the next match. Which one is the next match? The Premier League? Let’s go for the Premier League. If the next match is the FA Cup, let’s go for the FA Cup. It is difficult for me to say something is the priority. The priority is to work hard, work professionally and make the team better.
There is a lot of new talent for you to work with, exciting, flair players. How are you thinking about the style of the side right now?
First of all I need to work with them. I like the profile. I like the fact we have three, four or five players from the beginning of the winning Chelsea, and I think they have to be always a part of the Chelsea soul, so I’m so happy we kept some of these boys.
But the profile of the younger players with long-term space for improvement and development, I like very much that kind of profile. I’ve come with a four-year contract so with the age of Eden Hazard, Oscar, David Luiz and these boys, I think it will be good for me to work with them and good for them to work with me. Together we can improve and make a better team than we have now.
Can you tell us what the staff you are bring with you are going to do?
Rui Faria (pictured below left) as you know is my methodology right arm, the guy that understands best my information and the way I work. He’s been with me since the beginning, the same as Silvino. [Jose] Morais started working with me at Inter, at the time Andre [Villas-Boas] went to coach in Portugal. Morais does the same work Andre was doing - scouting and analysing, working hand in hand with [ Chelsea match analyst] James Melbourne. He’s been a friend for a long time and has been coaching in many countries, in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Tunisia, Sweden, Morocco. He’s a guy with fantastic experience and he’s working in that area.
 

 
From the previous staff I get Christophe Lollichon, Steve Holland and Chris Jones. They are people who have been here a long time and are very much trusted internally, and I’m happy to have them in my staff. From this moment they become only one staff, which is Chelsea staff, and we are going to work together and work hard to try to give what everybody is waiting for.
Presumably you need a holiday?
I am sorry we don’t start training tomorrow. I say to the players during the season when sometimes they look tired, victories make miracles. When you win, win, win, you are never tired. In my case, it’s not about winning, it’s about moving, moving to a place I love and happiness. I’m so happy to be back. The players need a holiday, I don’t. I’m waiting for them and when we start they will find somebody with great motivation, in spite of my white hair, which I didn’t have in 2004.
We go to Asia, then America and then play the Super Cup. You against Pep Guardiola, that’s a good start.
It’s not Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, it’s Chelsea and Bayern Munich. Mourinho did nothing to play this match, and Guardiola did nothing to play this match. The players did it, and the previous managers did it, so I will be in that match just by trying to help my club and my players win the trophy, nothing else. It’s not going to be crucial to our work or our season. We have to go to pre-season, work hard in pre-season. We have club commitments, that’s also important, and socially it’s important to go to areas such as Asia and the States, and give what the club need us to give, but we have to work hard.
Nine years ago in the Chelsea TV studio you looked in the camera and you said I can promise you quality, work and love and passion to bring success to the club. Would that be the same message you give today?
It is exactly the same message but now I can say I am one of you and that makes a little bit of a difference, I have never had that in football. I had in my career two great passions, Inter and Chelsea, and Chelsea is more than important for me. It was very, very hard to play against Chelsea and I did it only twice which was not so bad so now I promise exactly the same things I promised in 2004, with this difference which is I’m one of you.",0,1370294920,null,0,false,0,cabie4i,t3_1flfre,t1_cabie4i,t3_1flfre,null,1430937696,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

Nine years ago in the Chelsea TV studio you looked in the camera and you said I can promise you quality, work and love and passion to bring success to the club. Would that be the same message you give today?
It is exactly the same message but now I can say I am one of you and that makes a little bit of a difference, I have never had that in football. I had in my career two great passions, Inter and Chelsea, and Chelsea is more than important for me.

In The Doctor's Wife, we're told of a Time Lord, the Corsair, who had changed genders at least twice, but were not given much information beyond that.

These two ideas seem to be in conflict. But I am biased. I don't think there should be a female Doctor either.

Republicans will only be humiliated so much before people are driven out of the peace process, they still haven't gone away you know.

You might not like the idea that ex-killers are in government posts, but as a South Belfast taxi driver told me when explaining why he didn't think TV licence people should be active in the area: ""That is the price of peace"".

The GFA was a cessation of hostilities on both sides, whilst both sides may view it as a victory, to politically act and legislate as such undermines this consensus not to force the 'other side' to act as if they surrendered.
