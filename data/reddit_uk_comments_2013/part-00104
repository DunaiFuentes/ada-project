It really depends what you want from the town as to how you'll find it. There are nice parts of Worthing, and shit ones of course - but overall it's a lot nicer than many places. The nightlife leaves a lot to be desired - there is one club called, OneClub (Creative, huh?) and it's a dive. A few bars but really it's better off with pubs. Great pubs in Worthing, the George and Dragon in Tarring, the Cricketers in Broadwater to say the least.

Easy routes to Brighton, as has been mentioned, about 40 minutes to Gatwick and not much farther to London, obviously. Traffic can be bad on the A27, but it's the same everywhere in the south.

The main issue everyone seems to have with Worthing is parking. If you're driving into town and looking for somehwere cheap to park, you're gonna have a bad time, to use a Reddit cliché. It's ridiculous and drives people away from the town, so just walk. Or get a bus, the Pulse is regular and relatively cheap I think, I tend to cycle.

Overall the town has a nice feel to it I'd say, if you're at all Arty or want to get involved in community projects of societies there are plenty, I used to be a member of the History society, and also part of a local Samba band when I was younger (Forced.). There's Scouting too, if that's your sort of thing.

Plenty of places to eat out if you like that too, in Broadwater, in the town centre, Goring etc. Anywhere there's shops there's a restaurant. 

Also there's access to the South Downs National Park which is lovely, and if you're interested in history there's an Iron Age hillfort within 40 minutes of the town centre (ish).

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt;Ten explained to the Master in The End of Time: Part 2 that he time locked the Time Lords because they wanted to destroy the entire Universe in order to ascend into beings of pure consciousness.

But the only reason they wanted to do this was to not die. Which means that if just the Daleks got destroyed, they wouldn't want to do this anymore.

&gt;I'm not quite following. What did you find confusing about The End of Time? I don't think it was said in the episode but it's generally understood that The Doctor ended the time war by using The Moment, which both destroyed and time locked the Daleks/Time Lords/Gallifrey in a single second.

The reason I know for certain it are two separate events is because of the elaborate measures taken by Rassilon to bring Gallifrey out of the Timelock. The drumbeat, the diamond, all so Gallifrey could return to the  waking world. There would be no need for this if there was no Timelock. They could just leave, in fact, with the right timing, they could have left at the moment the Doctor uses the Moment and destroys the Daleks. Would have been perfect. 

&gt;If the Doctor had committed genocide ""just because it was easier"" then it actually would make even less sense that JH was 8.5, since he said ""what I did, I did without choice in the name of peace and sanity.""

Well it *did* bring about immediate peace and **sanity**. But the Doctor is not in the habit of just blowing people up, even if they are misguided or insane. He reasons with them, gives them a choice, tries to help and it's only when they're actually on the verge of hurting others that he steps in and stops them.

In terms of nicer areas.. Broadwater, Tarring, Goring-by-sea.

I'd say to avoid East Worthing (Particularly the top end of King Edward Avenue) Although some parts are better than others, it's a general trend that the west is better. 

That being said, Durrington is past West Worthing, and some parts of that should be avoided I guess. The strand and definitely the Quadrant are places not to live.

I've always heard Lancing being referred to as being 'rough' but really, it's a suburb on the South Coast.. It's not that bad.

Shoreham is nice also.

Ferring is nice if you're retiring, The South of Ferring rather than the North.

I don't know man, I think that is a pretty huge assumption you're making. Rassilon fried the only Time Lord at his table who spoke out against allowing them to ascend. I honestly don't think Rassilon would have just.. chosen not to be immortal anymore because the daleks were gone. Here's the script from that part of the episode in case you'd forgotton what was said:

***THE DOCTOR***
You weren't there. In the final
days of the War. You never saw
what was born. But if the
Timelock's broken, then everything's
coming through, not just the Daleks,
but the Skaro Degradations, the
Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare
Child, the Couldhavebeen King with
his Army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres. The War turned into Hell. 
And that's what you've opened,
right above the Earth. Hell is
descending.

***THE MASTER***
My kind of world!

***THE DOCTOR***
Just listen!!! Cos even the Time
Lords can't survive that -

***LORD PRESIDENT***
We will initiate the Final Sanction. 
The End of Time will come. At my
hand! The rupture will continue,
until it rips the Time Vortex apart.

***THE MASTER***
...but that's suicide.

***LORD PRESIDENT***
We will ascend! To become creatures
of consciousness alone. Free from
these bodies, free from time and
cause and effect; while creation
itself ceases to be.

***THE DOCTOR***
(to the Master)
D'you see, now? That's what they
were planning. In the final days
of the War. I had to stop them.

&gt;The reason I know for certain it are two separate events

I do believe that it is two separate weapons, but I do still think they were used at roughly the same time. I read up on it more since reading your theories and it looks like The Moment is a modified De-Mat gun that was capable of removing millions from reality at once, and the Time Lock is an ability of the TARDIS. The only thing to have escaped a (partial) Time Lock previously was Dalek-Caan, and it drove him insane. It would have been possible for the Time Lords to leave before The Moment was used on them or before they were Time Locked if they had the foreknowledge, so why didn't they?

&gt; But the Doctor is not in the habit of just blowing people up, even if they are misguided or insane. He reasons with them, gives them a choice, tries to help and it's only when they're actually on the verge of hurting others that he steps in and stops them.

Exactly. Based on his history and personality I think it would be irrational to assume that he never tried to reason with the Time Lords.

I LOVE it here. I never want to live anywhere else. Yeah, the weather isn't always grand, but. There aren't tornadoes tearing our homes apart and no ice storms or blizzards either. I get really pissed off when people joke about 'appalling British food' because it's fucking gorgeous. Seriously, *everything* about it is better - cheese, tea, bread, roast potatoes, chocolate. The pace of life is MUCH more human here. If I am sick and can't teach, my bosses are way more concerned about me than they are about me missing a day. 

I think everyone bitches about their home - remember bitching about your parents but if anyone said anything bad about your mum you'd rip their heads off? It's kinda the same thing. And in my opinion, *it's healthy*!!! How can you improve anything long term if you lack the narrative of dissatisfaction? Also, it makes for great comedy. Yes, the government is a joke right now and Osborne is doing his best to shaft us, but if we didn't get pissed off about it, how would we improve their egregious mistakes? And your govt isn't as much of a joke as America's. I mean, yeah, [a ton of new govt initiatives are just awful](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22664672) but at least you don't have 4 years of gridlock while the country goes in the toilet, term after term...

They're a fundamentalist Christian group. They regularly attack civilians, raping, killing, looting, horrifically mutilating and have been involved in genocide. They 'recruit' children - more than 5000 of them - both as soldiers and as sex-slaves. One account I have seen has particularly disturbed me, which I would recommend you skip this paragraph if you're easily disturbed - an escapee child was captured, and her friends were forced to bite her to death, with the orders that if they did not have a piece of her skin in their mouths, they too would suffer the same fate. That sort of thing is not isolated, and is a tool used often as punishment.

One of their jumbled aims is to create a theocratic Christian state with the laws of the Ten Commandments governing it, just like some Islamic groups want to use Sharia. They have killed tens of thousands of people at least in Uganda alone, and have displaced millions from their homes.

So, there are your Christian extremists, who have killed, or worse, many thousands of innocents. After a failed airstrike targetting them, they killed 865 civilians at once in a raid.

true,drehz,amy,Amy,"Just so I get this right... You're assuming the angel is a threedimensional wavefunction extending over all space, with the ability to manipulate the spatial location of its maximum with a rate of change related to the speed of light. The wavefunction collapses via observation. Hence, wherever you look, there's a small chance that an Angel will appear in front of you (proportional to the square of the sum of all Angels' wavefunctions). 

However, as the angels have already been shown to be able to manipulate the amplitude of their wavefunction, wouldn't it be evolutionarily advantageous to limit their spatial extent? After all, otherwise (considering a large number of Angels exists in the universe) every once in a (long) while an Angel preying on someone while unlocked would be localised in a completely different corner of the universe... And while we can assume that the Angel can't manipulate its wavefunction without limitation, surely it'd be advantageous for it to (as you pointed out) reduce its wavefunction within the visual field of the victim and extend it outside of it so it can approach more easily.

Finally, we have to consider the Angels' capture mechanism. It's established that they need to touch the victim to capture it - however, we can assume that this also coincides with a collapse of the wavefunction since no victim so far has disappeared by the wavefunction of an unlocked angel exceeding a certain amplitude. While one could assume that the touch is just another operation making the wavefunction collapse, I wonder whether the Angels, already having been shown to be adept at manipulating their wavefunction, might possess the ability to collapse their own wavefunction as well? It would certainly be useful to terrify their victims, and make the capture easier.

As the touch immediately zaps the victim back in time, I'm assuming that the victim doesn't ""perceive"" the Angel from the touch, the zap happens immediately. Hence it would make sense for the wavefunction to be collapsible by two mechanisms: Observation, and self-collapse by the Angel itself.

true,JerkDaniels,lfc12,,"I see everyone commenting on how some experience at the back is what we need, we have that already though - even after Carra is gone. His name is Daniel Agger.

He's made 155 appearances for us since 2005, we'd be devastated without him, he's made 35 appearances with us this year alone (most he's made in a single season). 

With Carra gone there's going to be a void to be filled, I see Dan filling that void. We all considered him for Vice Captain, he Captains his national team. He's the future leader of our back line, period. 

With that said I look forward to Toure if his salary is fitting just because he's a seasoned prem player. 'Papa', I'd love bringing him in because we need some fire on the field. I'm under the impression that after Mascherano left, we never replaced that mental dynamic, and most teams need that spitfire player that goes 110% 24/7; he'll give the opposition and refs an earful. 

Skrtel, as much as I love the guy, hasn't played enough of late and it's showing. I don't think BR is all in for him and I don't think Martin is willing to be a squad player so I see him on his way. 

Downing, needs to be retained. He's humbled up and worked his way into being one hell of an asset to the club alongside Hendo. Both guys can be cycled in and out. I'm looking forward to Hendo in the future. 

Eriksen isn't coming to us. If he did I would be shocked BUT I think he's going to run a hell of a premium and end up else where. 

I would like to see us grab another No. 9, and another seasoned defensive mid that is at home filling in Lucas' shoes, not a small and offensive Joe Allen or a visual savant like Gerrard. For that reason alone I was so hyped up on the prospect of signing Victor Wanyama.

Alot of time left, we'll see how it pans out. I have full faith and trust in BR and his scouting team after Cou and Sturridge.

Why?  Because public appetite for another large scale deployment into a Muslim country is non-existent.  Whys that?  Because our troops keep getting killed over there, and we get terrorist attacks at home.

What I LOVE about Lew, if I had to name just one major defining factor he presents over a lot of others, Villa included, is this. Lew tracks back, is involved at all times, closes down well, tracks back, ALWAYS seems to get a foot on the ball, wether going forwards or back. He drops into space well, can make the best of any ball played anywhere near him. He's just so fucking intelligent and talented at his age..Defoe and Ade bring nothing close to that. I will say, it was nice seeing Ade drop back a bit and THEN go forward into space after linking up. That is something , had he done all season, as wel all know, would have made a major difference.

Anyways, that's why I think Lew would be the best striker for Spurs to break the bank on. He is a future RVP. I'd say he has some even better characteristics developing already and he is was younger than RVP ( who is another favourite of mine)

That's intense, I didn't know that! I knew they are onto him but thought he might stay with BVB ( one can dream, again, eh?) or perhaps Man Utd. I honestly think, given how similar to RVP he is, he would benefit more at UTD than Bayern, although I think he will kill it with either of those teams. 

Villa is like I said, not my favourite choice anymore. Break leg break, oh in an instant...but he's not that player any more.

Would we not benefit more from a Welback, Hernandez type player who are on the outside looking in right now, while at a crucial stage of their careers?  I think we would!!

Because the latter seems far more plausible an explanation.

true,Apostasy4ever,smith,Smith,"&gt;But the only reason Rassilon was so dead set on it was because he didn't want to die.

I don't know. I'm still convinced that they were trying very hard to make Rassilon come across as a lost cause.. almost all the Time Lords driven mad by the Time War except the 3 that protested at the end, The Doctor and The Master.

&gt;He already had to secret to flawless perpetual regeneration.

Personally I wouldn't call it flawless. Correct me if I'm wrong, but assuming his ability to regenerate works the same way as The Doctors, then if he is killed while regenerating then he can still die. Or any of the number of things that had almost killed The Doctor all these years. The only path to true immortality, as far as Rassilon seemed to be concerned, was to use The Final Sanction. 

Remember, they changed their minds about never ever using a powerful weapon before. The De-Mat guns were originally outlawed, too. Then they decided to mass produce them once the Time War broke out. After years of watching your people get slaughtered and reborn just to get slaughtered again over and over and over, losing a little bit of your ""humanity"" every time (Time Lords seem to have a problem with that in the first place.. some weren't very nice to begin with, considering they tried to have The Valeyard execute The Doctor just because he was the sole witness to their almost wiping out Earth).. Just saying The Final Sanction might start to look like a good idea after a while.

&gt;Which is exactly why I'm assuming he didn't. And that that's the John Hurt business.

Well it's a theory that could fit in, just one that I don't personally think will end up happening. To each their own.

I'd like to find out what he meant when he was so shocked that he told River his real name saying ""there's only one time I could.""

I'm starting to think JH is a mental persona of a collection of memories of all the terrible things the Doctor has done throughout his entire lifetime for the greater good. The Doctor gets lonely.. maybe he can't bear his own thoughts when he's alone. He needs a companion as much as it hurts him to lose them regardless of if they die or if he just drops them off at home and never returns. Maybe he's afraid that if it gets out that he's done all those terrible things that no one will love him anymore. Even the people he loves will fear him or be disgusted by him because he is afraid of and disgusted by JH too. 

His companions can forgive some things because they understand and witness all the good he does, but could they forgive everything? The double genocide of the time war, the genocide of the Racnoss, The Valeyard, not being able to save The Master, losing Rose.. every person who has ever died or suffered because of him or because he couldn't figure out how to save everyone in time.. everything all wrapped up into one mental image and shoved behind a door in his mind. He remembers all of it but tries not to think about it, just like when he asked Rory about remembering the 2000 years he guarded the Pandorica. I think this is who he saw behind his door #11 in that hotel. He's all of the Doctors and none of them, and The Doctor refuses to acknowledge him as The Doctor at all.",0,1369581216,null,0,false,0,ca6b575,t3_1f0e6c,t1_ca6b575,t1_ca68va3,null,1431027800,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Kuroikami,null,null,"hmm  good point.  Also, I yield to your greater knowledge of physics!

It can't be all over all possible space, else the danger of being locked somewhere while simultaneously feeding somewhere else.  So it has to be localized into a general area--sort of a Field of Potential Angel.  Each being exists within this field at every location within it until they are perceived or self-select and thus end the FPA property and become a Statuary Angel.  This then gets us to the dual-form Angel without the requirement of a strict physical identity (""Bodies are Boring,"" quoth the Doctor) meaning that what ""we"" see as Angels is only half of their totality.  

I also wish to question, then, why the Angels always attack in a straight line--good for plot, but bad for predators.  If the sum of what is an Angel includes the FPA, why doesn't the Angel self-select, when hunting, to appear at a point outside the visual range of the target in order to become fully unlocked during a blink, then pounce by finding the fastest route after that?  I think the answer lies in the personality of the Angels--ease of capture and evolution be damned, they enjoy tormenting their prey.  Also, doing that simple maneuver would make them terrifically lethal.  Like the future trouble of super-speed Cybermen, Angels that can dodge will cause tremendous headaches for the Doctor.  In order to keep the Doctor on top, there has to be a way to stop them, and that way is the Angels' innate love of torment.

Regarding the victim perceiving the touch:  It's a gimme.  Victims DO perceive both touch and Angel, but by then it's too late.  The zap is effectively instant, Amy's crying eyes notwithstanding, and all the victims of it know something is happening based around the point at which they were touched.  This would collapse the FPA and lock the Angel, but only so long as the person was around in that timeline.  The person zaps back, the SA goes back to FPA and viola.  In short, a successful attack would be someone suddenly going ""Oh bugger!"" and blipping out of existence, a quick still of a smiling Angel, and then nothing--very close to exactly what ""we"" the audience see.

To further the discussion--the best defense against an Angel is a mirror.  If whatever holds the image of an Angel is itself an Angel, and two Angels looking at each other mutually quantum-lock, then at a moment in which the Statuary Angel attacking you bares fang and claw, eyes open, arms wide for capture, you draw out a mirror and make it lock eyes with itself, BOOM, stuck.  You've got two Statuary Angels looking (fiercely) at each other forever.  You'd think that the Angels would avoid any water planet like Earth due to the ease of reflection.

true,english_man_abroad,null,null,"Other than saying ""we're just like that"", I think it comes down to our history. Until about 100 years ago, we were the best. We ruled a decent chunk of the entire world, and were one of the most powerful countries there was. But now that's not the case, and so with the withdrawal of Britain's power and influence, so has a lot of the patriotic fervour which that evokes in people, and the outward pride that people take in their country.

This relatively small decline (we're still ""up there"" with much bigger countries,and take pride in that) has also brought perspective, and an ability to laugh at ourselves which is less easy to do when you're in charge. I know this is a generalisation, but the excessive ""USA! USA!"" patriotism and chest-thumping love of one's country that is seen as a positive in America, starts to look a bit silly from our perspective. I reckon that in a few decades when China's in charge, the same kind of attitudes will develop in America.

The post-colonial years have left older generations of British people disappointed with a power that's now dwindled and maybe yearn for a life that is now in the past. I think this is best represented by our sitcom characters. Basil Fawlty, Blackadder, Del Boy, David Brent, Norman Stanley Fletcher, Reginald Perrin, Hancock, Victor Meldrew  - they're all characters who feel trapped in a situation which is beneath them. They think they're the smartest person in the room, but constantly find their attempts at clawing their way out of their predicament frustrated by the exterior circumstances of the world around them. So we laugh at them or they laugh at themselves.

I think most people who live in Britain realise that it's a great country, and feel a lot of pride about it deep down. But who wants to live in a country or talk to people in a place where everybody thinks everything is brilliant?

true,drehz,amy,Amy,"(Studying Physics gotta be good for something :D )

From a quantum mechanical standpoint, having a definite spatial limit to the FPA would require an infinite potential barrier - an interesting proposition for sure, and I think something that could be established as one of the properties of an Angel. However, I would disagree with your duality proposition - if I understand correctly, this would imply the momentary excitations to exist independent of the field...

I think a free particle within an infinite angel potential well might be a more accurate analogy. It has the ability to manipulate its wavefunction within limits - if it could bring the wavefunction to a maximum at one point and a minimum at the other points, this would be equivalent to teleportation at will, which is not what is observed. 

However, there's another interesting property of the free particle, in particular one which has been observed: After its wavefunction has been collapsed by observation, it will spread out from the point where it was last observed with time. This provides an answer to your question: Say an Angel has just been observed, and a negligible time has passed since the observation ended. Then its wavefunction will spread out from its physical location radially. The best hunting tactic for the Angel is now to maximise the wavefunction to the best of its ability at the point closest to the victim - this point will always lie on a straight line between the location and the victim, it is the most efficient approach. With a long enough period without observation (and thus a wide enough spread), the wavefunction might extend beyond the victim - in this case, the Angel could maximise its wavefunction behind the victim's back and choose to collapse it, zapping the victim back. I'd like to point out that as the Angel seems to behave analogous to a quantum mechanical particle, the speed at which the wavefunction extends is another property of the Angel and need not be related to the description of a quantum mechanical particle (One could for example imagine the spreading speed exponentially decaying with distance, with negligibly low spread speeds at the FPA barrier).

A quick touch on collapsing wavefunctions: I agree that the touch would probably count as an interaction, however even assuming the touch has a delayed effect on the victim the collapse of the wavefunction and physical manifestation must happen ahead of the touch for the touch to be possible. Hence the Angel would have to collapse its own wavefunction - and I'd like to point out that it must only have the ability to collapse the wavefunction in time, not in space. This means the Angel can decide *when*, but not *where* to appear. 

And a mirror is a nice solution assuming the Angels have the ability to recognise themselves - arguably if in their perception a mirror convolutes an image beyond recognition, they do not interact with themselves, and are therefore not localised.

They cite the Talons of Weng Chiang as being a part of it for casting a white guy as an asian man. Except that was the show in 1977. Are you kidding me? How does that even apply to the current incarnation?

Then the next part cited by the story is the ""Let's Kill Hitler"" episode because it wasn't serious enough? If there is a better way to counter racial superiority than to minimize it with humor I don't know of one.

Also they missed out on a part of that episode there...you know, the part where it's later revealed that the [S6E6, E12 Spoiler](#sw ""Doctor's wife as well as Emily and Rory's child"") is black?

The English imperialism line is especially funny, because most of the stories involve the Doctor freeing people and allowing them to rule themselves. I just don't get it.

Bierkeller is usually a fun and messy night but tends to be very clichéd, expect to spot a fair few angsty 15 year olds dressed all in black with fake IDs,  my advice is to get drunk somewhere decent - like the Gryphon or the Mother's Ruin - and then go to the Bierkeller when your standards have been sufficiently lowered. It is not a venue to be enjoyed sober. But it can be very enjoyable when rat-arsed. 

Memory of Elephants - a really excellent 'noise rock' trio are playing Mr. Wolf's tomorrow. 

Honestly though, when I was 17/18 (I'm 27 now) the indie/rock club scene in Bristol was so much better. The live-music scene is more vibrant and varied now but the club scene is meh.  

I wouldn't recommend Bristol for clubbing these days. I feel kind of sorry for the 18 year old students here now who think this is what clubbing is like.  For your own sakes kids go to Manchester or Liverpool for a weekend and experience a proper club night - where everyone gets on the dance floor for every song. 

If I were you I'd put aside just one or two nights for clubbing, and you might as well go cheap and cheerful and go to bierkeller for that, but go to gigs on other nights and enjoy the live music/pub scene.

If you've been working in the UK for only a few months, looking to move on so quickly after that will look bad. 

I am assuming of course that you're in a permanent position at the moment? If so - you'll need good reasons for wanting to leave it - otherwise this screams 'risk' to me. (Imagine I'm an employer - how would I know you'll stick with *my* company for anything more than a few months?). 

All that being said - if you don't want to put your current job at risk then you'll have to pay your dues there and not take too much time off. I hate to say it but if you're sporadically away for half a day, 7 or 8 times in a couple of months, I'd certainly start raising an eyebrow over why you were really off work.

true,PancakeDoomsday,lfc12,,"You have a point, we really could have used Kuyt the first half the season, but when BR came in with his philosophy and with FSG really starting to push their agenda of developing young players, Kuyt's departure became inevitable. Keeping Kuyt for another season, whether until December or the summer, may have helped our attack, but only for the short term and I don't really know how much better we would have done with him in the side. His experience, leadership, and tireless work rate were sorely missed, but this past season was all about growth, which is inherently painful. Those traits will develop in our players as time goes on (though very few will ever be able to match the magnitude of effort Dirk put into every minute of every game).

It was, I believe, better to be thin up front for the first few months as it provided game time for the likes of Sterling, who is a big part of our long term plans. 

We have to think of the long term gains of each of our players: Kuyt (now Srktel, allegedly) aren't a part of our future, they provide excellent experience and leadership (maybe just Kuyt, since BR faulted himself for not giving Carragher more game time by stating he ""needed more leadership"" on the pitch), but in both instances the club would benefit more from selling them and run the risk of being a bit thin than from benching a player who could/should be playing first-team football somewhere.

1. Driving is no longer a pleasure; petrol and insurance means that it is expensive, and lo and behold on your long-distance journey, it's rush hour, or there's roadworks every ten miles, or an accident. More people also travel by train, even for pleasure. Now, people just want to get somewhere without having to stop. Thus, eating on the go is preferred, while roadside cafes in general become a relic of a bygone era.

2. We drink more coffee. Thus, coffee culture does not include enormous breakfasts but something smaller, somewhat more continental, sweet items, such as croissants, pastries, and muffins (though not strictly European). 

3. What we eat for breakfast has changed. Not only has what we eat for breakfast diversified since the 1990s, it's generally smaller than before. Some people don't eat breakfast at all, just drinking coffee or tea. When we want a full English, it's generally in a more sedate setting, such as at home on a weekend, in a local cafe or at a hotel.

It's surprising that Little Chef have even survived this long. Railway stations got rid of their buffets/greasy spoons a long time ago in favour of Starbucks and M&amp;S, followed by the motorway service stations themselves. Times change, and we have changed with it.

I was on the crew for the weekend, I first saw Jenna at about 9 in the morning when she was first coming out, promptly froze up entirely and managed 'hello' in a northern accent... I've never even been to the north. 

She had a hectic first convention, I never went past her without there being a queue, I don't think she stopped apart from lunch/drink.etc breaks all day. 

She is smaller than you would expect. The photo op was a fairly rushed job, say hello a few lines, have a photo in &lt;X&gt; pose and move along. 

Advantage of being crew was that I was able to go right at the end of the day for the signature, in fact mine was the last thing she signed before going home, she had a good humour about it and wrote much more than the standard signature that she had to do for most people (just so she could get through everyone before close). 

On Sunday I was assisting the lovely Kenny Baker all day with breaks to go on my photoshoots, Bernard was a great sport and hilarious to boot (Somebody brought an Adipose, 'Oh, they're... They're the ones made of the fat!', in his voice. Funny.) Anyway, the photo you see is the 3rd attempt because for some reason they had the flash pointing at the ceiling (Probably because he didn't like flash photography in his eyes) and it kept causing my face to be darkened out by the shadow of MY HAIR.

Billie I met last and got extremely lucky, arriving (from being let off my desk/changing) just as she was picking up her bags to go. She was a great sport, went straight back there and even had a little conversation, although my mind went blank as it always seems to in these situations.

true,ThePaisleyLady,donna,Donna,"So, this might come off as ignorant, but is Alex Kingston not a light skinned black woman with dyed blonde hair?  I read her wiki, but besides finding out that she has Jewish ancestry and was married to Lord Voldemort (!), I couldn't find anything.  My friends say that she is white, but I just don't see it.  Also, her previous incarnation, Mel, was *definitely* black.  And she definitely kicks a lot of butt, is highly intelligent, and is never the damsel in distress.

I have had many of the same thoughts that the ""academics"" are pointing out.  From what little of Great Britain I know as an American, I have been lead to believe that there is a large Indian population in England, but you don't see that a lot in the series.  I have also wondered why there wasn't more of a variety of different kinds of companions, which are largely white, female, and hetero-normative.  

BUT, I do not believe the show is racist.  Like many others in this thread have mentioned, I understand that the show is a reflection of the times as well as where it is from.  The show has been becoming more and more diverse as time goes on.  As of yet, we do not fully understand how regeneration works.  River showed us that regenerations can change skin tone.  Then again, she is half human, so there is that.  We do not know yet whether sex/gender can change.  Perhaps if a Time Lord is born white and male, they will stay that way, even though things like hair and eye color can obviously change.  We are all waiting to find out. 

If anything, a huge part of why I love Doctor Who is because it is largely about solving problems that are analogous to our own.  The Doctor does not go back in time to prevent the Holocaust or the slave trade.  Those things are much too dark for the tone of the show, and even if he did those things, how would they make up for it in present day?  Those things are horrible, but they shaped our world into what it is now.  We would not be the same without them, and they are in fact largely what caused us to turn against racism in the first place.  But he does solve *similar* problems all across time and space.  He does fight the Daleks and the Cybermen, obvious representations of Nazis.  And on top of that, he is not a gun slinging action hero.  If at all possible, the Doctor's first option is non-violence.  That is the sort of hero our time needs.  I am a nerd of all stripes, and I love watching The Avengers wipe the floor with aliens as much as the next person, but Doctor Who is so much better than that, exactly because diplomacy is his first choice.

What ensued was a discussion about his benefits etc, which is a topic my friends say also crops up quite often.

Then there's the ""I've got a cold doctor, I need you to prescribe me some antibiotics"" consultations, which are virtually all a waste of time at best, and at worst result in people receiving medical treatment for something self-limiting and probably not serious.  

What's worrying is that people are starting to attend A&amp;E with similar problems, due to overspill from overworked GPs (I have personally seen patients with a hangover, and who were hungry after a night out and wanted a sandwich in A&amp;E).  The increased paperwork many GPs now must do also drags them away from consultations.  Some partners now only spend 1/3 of their time consulting.

It is possible to be happy anywhere but Brits (Westerners in general) are in the main oblivious as to how to achieve this, having sleptwalked into the organised religion of materialism.

The good news I suppose is that there does appear to now be an increase in spirituality here in the UK, hopefully making 'escape'  easier for those who seek; I've yet to hear anyone say any different. Although I'd say *on average* UK residents are becoming more degenerate, and I think this is evident from the poor standard of health despite remarkable advances in medicine; especially concerning to me is the high level of mental health issues (and problems such as diabetes and obesity) in young people.

We're going to be OK. Last week was a tough week on a couple of levels, but we've survived worse as a people. 

The EDL are a tiny group of worthless racist scumbags who are quickly going to find themselves ignored. In fact, they know they're being ignored right now: that's why they're violent, it's their only means to having a voice.

There are a tiny number of dangerous extremists in the country who - as the news this weekend has made clear - are well known to the authorities. They might not be watched daily, and nothing is going to stop one of them going insane and deciding to go on a killing, but they're not really ""lurking"". They are going to be dealt with fairly and within the confines of UK and EU law. The idiots who committed this crime will undergo a trial, they'll argue their violence was justified, they'll go to prison. They'll probably stay there at the Home Secretary's discretion (read: indefinitely).

And life will move on. As we did in 2005 we will all learn a little more about each other, a few will retreat in fear from others for a while, and then recover. We'll go on together as a country, and we will be our usual selves.

The people on /r/worldnews are ignorant, racist yobs. I don't care what they think of you, me, or any of our countrymen and countrywomen. Neither should you.

We know we're alright. We know we're going to be OK. We know that we'd rather be here with all it's [real problems](/r/britishproblems), than in a country as divided and as broken as the US is right now. My father is a naturalised US citizen living in CA, and whilst I'm sure he likes the weather, I would imagine he doesn't enjoy the partisan, racist, xenophobic and fearful state of politics he lives under.

So let them hate. Ignore them. Tomorrow have a full English breakfast to start your Bank Holiday, and later on go to a proper British pub and have a proper British pint. In the evening go for a curry: a symbol of English cultural fusion if ever there was one. And you'll realise the real England is just the same as it was before last week, that this temporary blip will not change our resolve to be a United Kingdom in the modern sense of both words, and the haters?

Just want to point out that the increase in UKIP in particular is more closely tied to our political system and the lack of an ""alternative party."" A lot of people are protest voting UKIP.    

 - LibDem are in power and broke their promises.    
 - Labour were in power for 10+ years and everyone is sick of their bullshit (plus the current front bench is shit).   
 - Greens kind of fell off the wagon because both Labour AND the Tories stole a lot of their agenda.    
 - Tories are in power and broke their promises.    

So who does a pissed off voter vote for? Well UKIP will be on their ballet and they would have heard of them, and likely agree with re-establishing our relationship with the EU, so they just tick that box (completely unaware of the UKIP's other policies).

Which I don't like because I believe the progress we've made in this country over the last century or so is astounding, and we'd be fools to give it up in the name of cultural relativism. And this is why I think the argument surround immigration isn't about race, it's about culture. 

As for it ticking along nicely, I think there are a couple of linked issues at play here. Firstly, there has been a general attitude amongst certain elements of the progressive types that if you have a problem with immigration, then you are likely to be a racist little englander. And I don't think many people are, they just don't like living in a society where depending on location it's entirely possible to feel like a unwelcome foreigner in an area you spent your entire life, especially if the change was relatively rapid as it has been over the last decade or so. Part of living in a society is sharing similar values and culture, and if you can't do that it will promote the sense of the other. 

Secondly, the economy took a dive in the late 00's and that always makes people feel less tolerant and more vocal about the things that piss them off. So what was an undercurrent is now bubbling over and resulting in political support for parties like UKIP, who might not have all the answers but do at least appear to be listening when it comes to issues relating to immigration.

I don't think DW is racist (non-white USA person here). I think that DW is a product of its culture and its culture is mainly a white one. But some of the logic these people are using doesn't work: like sure, the 5th Doctor has roots going back to the racist British Empire, but that doesn't make DW racist. That's like saying that if you wear the clothes of a Victorian Englishman you are sexist because of the views Victorian England had about gender.

Also, we've had 3 non-white companions iirc. Mickey, Martha and Chang Lee. There aren't that many people of color in Doctor Who and that's a result of the culture in which DW is made. That's not some kind of racism. Go to China and most characters on tv will be (shockingly) Chinese.

Doctor Who has been racist before though. Using the n-word in The Celestial Toymaker wasn't cool. Nor was the the treatment of PoCs in Tomb of the Cybermen. Funnily enough I would actually excuse the yellowface in Talons of Weng-Chiang (for reasons).

Okay, 10's comment about walking around like he owns the place? That was intentional. It was another example of 10 being a dumb-face and brushing Martha off. His comment is obviously one of privilege. The Doctor has racial, gender, ability, and cis privilege. And economic privilege because he doesn't worry about money.

The way the first Doctor looks down on primitive races, especially the ""red Indian"" comment does reflect Western values and ethnocentrism. But that story was in the 1960s and Doctor Who is a different show now. Calling Indians red? Not cool. But the analogy the Doctor uses is apt, if a reflection on Western views.

Time Lords being racist? I don't think so. Time Lords are xenophobic superior high-nosed bureaucrats though.

Though reading that last line about the BBC being ""color blind"". That's not good. I know lots of people think color blindness is the answer to reducing racism, but it's actually not. Ignoring the problem only works for white people because they don't suffer negatively from racism. Through no conscious effort of any individual, the system is rigged against non-white people so when hiring, white people (or any PoCs who are hiring for that matter) need to be conscious of race.

I acknowledge instances of racism and the Western view from which Doctor Who is often told, but I don't think the show itself is racist.",0,1369612830,null,0,false,0,ca6jqe6,t3_1f36i0,t1_ca6jqe6,t3_1f36i0,null,1431023680,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"In the same situation coming to the same conclusion. However I don't blame the Lib Dems for the fee rise which makes it simpler. It was a Conservative policy that they would not budge on. No doubt the Lib Dems were stupid for making a promise that they would not be able to keep in a coalition (which was probable before the election and should have been foreseeable) and in addition they could have fought harder for it maybe making it very public so that if they lost we would all know that they had tried but it was the Conservatives who had forced it through. I think that would have been better politics. But while they received just retribution for their failings I don't equate omission to properly oppose or missing opportunities with the positive policy idea. It was a Conservative idea and they should be blamed for it. That fact seems to have been lost on many students.

true,Kuroikami,null,null,"How interesting in that we've now come to have the Angels represent a, to coin a bizarre term, macro-quantum effect!  By limiting the, uh, ""diffusion"" diameter of any radiant FPA in order to keep the Angel from simultaneously being seen and locked in position A while simultaneously successfully remaining unseen at all points non-A, as well as to, if you'll pardon, ""cram as many angels into the wreck of the Byzantium"" as possible, we have a directly observable physical manifestation of quantum effects-- A really big particle in a box!

Another interesting thing about the model is that there are two observational limiters here--the Angel and, to keep it simple, the Target.  I think your description of the hunting technique is brilliant--The Angel, attempting to chase it's victim is then, in essence, trying to observe itself closer to the target, who is trying to observe the Angel at the distance it currently is being seen at.  A blink disrupts the equilibrium in favor of the Angel (because they never have been seen to be blinking) and a jump happens.  Sort of a vicious Amoeba-like attack, or a lethal game of red-light/green-light.  Doing some quick sketch math:

if the ""Angel"" is 10m from target, held in equilibrium at a glance,
The duration of a blink is (fastest) around 300 ns,
That Angel should be able to cover 90m in that time.
Generally, then, the movement potential by the Angel within the FPA must be *much* smaller than that 90m or no victim would ever be able to run.

Revisiting the episodes, it seems that the Angels tend to move 1-2m per blink (unless plot dictates otherwise,) so I would propose that the FPA has a maximum willful movement distance (from the Angel) and a maximum potential movement distance (as a base ready state.)  This would allow your scenario of an FPA having been unobserved for some time becoming so diffuse that a target could be surrounded (or walk into it!) and  **ZAP!**  and as well as enact the battle of wills that we often see in the series with a person trying to stave off blinking only to see the Angel getting closer and closer.  If we agree that the Angel's ability to observe itself being closer the victim is limited, that gives us a shorter movement along that direct line of attack. Unfortunately, we can't speak to the composition of the FPA (in terms of organs, etc.) because we could then make an argument as to the ability of an Angel to see the target's blink, have the signal propagate along the nerves to the brain, cause the ""observed point"" to change, and thus the manipulation of the field (also a nerve signal to whatever does THAT) and, after adding all that up and multiplying by *c*, figure out the true  maximum distance an Angel could appear to ""jump"" as its Target blinked.  Shame.

It's interesting to think about that in the above scenario, what's attacking a target isn't really even a Statuary Angel--that's what they *become*--but instead what they *are,* which is a sentient waveform disbursed across an area with predatory intent.  What we perceive as the Angels is the shape the waveform coalesces into--out of pure spite, it seems.

&gt; While the woman has every right to wear whatever the fuck she wants, I too would be a little WTF about the leather in a professional environment, as I would be with anybody of any age or gender. Expect for outerwear, perhaps. And shoes and bags, of course. I guess it depends on the workplace culture, but I'm not too far off 25 and I think I'd probably sooner die than go for a ""hot biker chick"" look for work. Or a hot anything.

You're a Westerner, and as I (perhaps not clearly enough) explained above, we are all slaves to social conditioning, and there's a huge disparity between our culture versus that of others. I would ask you to try to put yourself in the shoes of an Inuit female or similar, for whom the wearing of leather etc (I'm thinking sheepskin boots, specifically Uggs) is a survival technique. Now, I am absolutely not saying that the fashion trends you disagree with will always originate overseas, but frankly, since the end of WWII the fashion industry is COMPLETELY out of new ideas. Hence the repeat of 40s, 80s and 90s fashion. They have nothing left in the original fashion bank. So to satisfy their subscribers they turn to overseas culture. So some poor, freezing cow is clad in leather (which, btw, is extremely warm) and a fur coat. Doesn't take a brain scientist to suss that connection. 


I'm admittedly a conservative girl, as far as dress goes. And variety is spice of life, right? I think OP feels a similar way, not tutting or disapproving, just vaguely confused about her work wardrobe choices. I mean, as respectful of the rights of others to any choices they deem fit as I am, I do sometimes privately wonder when people make decisions I can't follow the reasoning of.
I agree that the woman's departure from cultural norms are the main reason why OP and I find her choices odd. I think OP was trying to find out if her outfit would fall under a more widely socially accepted context than the ones she knows about. That's where your argument is the most valid: who says she has to fit into anyone else's idea of appropriate? Though I do feel like work attire is where you have the least wiggle room.
While I intellectually understand that I have no place judging her I do because I'm human and that's what humans do. It's an unrealistic thing to expect not to be judged based on your appearance; it's counter to how the mind works. Our choices in how we look are a form of communication, designed to elicit a response. I don't have to approve of or understand her outfit even if I fully support her right to wear it. But it's a very private thing that I realize does not matter, does not change who she is as a person, and should not affect the way she is treated.

This is because your world view has not yet developed to the extent of some others. I don't mean that as an insult, it's genuinely just fact. For most of us our most formative opinions are made between the age of 13-20, after that, it takes years of correction and clarification to realise that we are not always correct.

Personally, I like being suited and booted for work, but the perceptions I have come across suggest that those who slack are less capable. I don't entirely believe that, but as a somewhat self-aware individual, I'll report that it is impossible for me to work from home without my flat being tidy, having showered and put my face on. Even when I know that nobody is there to judge, those patterns are still reinforced.

Of course, ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" are fairly loose concepts that are open to interpretation.

potpan0's question implies that the Labour party has become authoritarian since abandoning its left-wing ideals.  But the truth is that left-wing movements are inherently authoritarian.

From memory, the genes which contribute to skin colour and other ""racial characteristics"" are multifarious and operate on a continuum with no clear cut off point, in exactly the same fashion as the genetic variability of height.  So, for example, a multitude of genes will affect a multitude of features such as how much of particular substances are secreted at particular times during a person's development, which in turn contribute to the size of particular bones/organs etc., which ultimately sum into someone's eventual total height.  There's no gene for being tall or short. And likewise, no gene for being Caucasian or Negroid or Mongoloid or whatever.  There's more variability within these (or any other so-called ""racial"") categories than between them.

I do agree that 'left-wing' governments are authoritarian by nature - their goals require centralisation and collectivisation, which are opposed to the more liberal ideas of localism and negative liberty. Really though, authoritarianism isn't so much dictated by ideology as it is by events - the old Liberal Party was not authoritarian ideologically for instance, but in practice it most definitely was.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"In general, there are more chances that the wingbacks will be caught higher up the pitch, leaving the opposing winger with more space behind to break into a counter. It just takes a lot more organization and understanding from the wingbacks and also the CDM/CB's in order for it to work well. We've played the majority of the season with 4 at the back, it would take adjusting to play 3 at the back. Johnson and Enrique would make great wingbacks, and with Wisdom and Kelly coming in, they would be great in a 3-5-2 because of their mobility. but earlier we had Skrtl and Coates, which made me nervous. 

As you mentioned, any formation could work. a 3-5-2 would really benefit a possession based game, but we've been playing with 4-2-3-1 this whole season. 3 -5-2 requires a whole new understanding between the WB's, the CDM, and the CBs, which is why it makes me nervous. It already took us the first half of the season to get used to playing 4 at the back in rodgers possession style. Adjusting to 3 might not be so different, but it still makes me nervous. 

Currently fielding 3 CB's means fielding 2 inexperirenced CB's next to Agger, another thing that makes me nervous. i get nervous.

I prefer the current system with one fullback going up to support, effectively shifting into a 3-5-2 formation either way. To me its more versatile and its what we are more comfortable with. the only downside is that we've had to watch Johnson defend in the box... 

if we shift to a 3-5-2 i'd be very excited to see the results. but I really like 4-2-3-1 as it is a good mix of defense/offense, is versatile, and suits are players well. ",0,1369622849,null,0,false,0,ca6mmkn,t3_1f15jo,t1_ca6mmkn,t1_ca6m67k,null,1431022244,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

An Iraq Ministry of Health survey at the same time claimed 400,000 excess deaths, and a year later the ORB survey suggested 1.2 million deaths by 2007, which they later revised down to 1,033,000. It's fair to say this last survey has received methodological criticism.  All of these figures are well above the 250,000 you are claiming for the entire conflict and we haven't even touched on the first Gulf War and the interim period yet!

Daponte's original estimate for the first war was 158,000 Iraqis and approximately 300 Americans, but she subsequently revised this upwards to 205,000.  The consensus seems to be that she may have over-estimated battlefield deaths, but the civilian death figures are about right.

Deaths during the no-fly zone and under sanctions, as well as during the pre Iraq War II period of heavy bombardment by Anglo-American forces have been fairly wide-ranging too, but [Wikipedia's page on it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_sanctions#Estimates_of_deaths_due_to_sanctions) includes links to reports (including UNICEF and UN studies) ranging from none to 1,000,000 additional deaths.  We can question the outliers, but it seems highly likely that several 100s of 1000s of children have died as a result of sanctions alone.

Of course it is.  There's a list of precedents as long as your arm where policies introduced to restrict the rights of an unpopular or powerless group were extended to cover everybody.  In fact, it's basically always happened.  No piece of legislation supposedly aimed at a small group but with the potential to be used for all citizens, has ever stayed in the bottle, it's always been used on everyone else.  Glenn Greenwald is pretty hot on this:

[""But that's always how rights are abridged: by targeting the most marginalized group or most hated individual in the first instance, based on the expectation that nobody will object because of how marginalized or hated they are. Once those rights violations are acquiesced to in the first instance, then they become institutionalized forever, and there is no basis for objecting once they are applied to others, as they inevitably will be (in the case of the War on Terror powers: as they already are being applied to others).""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/20/boston-marathon-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-mirnada-rights)",0,1369627093,null,0,false,0,ca6nww0,t3_1f2xic,t1_ca6nww0,t1_ca6n5wh,null,1431021638,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So figure it this way. He can pilot it pretty much perfectly most of the time, because he knows what he's doing, but without a navigation system he has no way to compensate for the Tardis's own impulses - think of a boat in the ocean without GPS, you can still manouver the ship perfectly fine but if you drift slightly off course you wouldn't have any way of knowing.

So, for example, when the 9th doctor tried to take Rose home the first time, he landed on the exact spot where he wanted to be, but then discovered that instead of being the morning after they left, it was a year later, just in time to stop aliens destroying the earth.

It's not as big a change as you might think. We've essentially been playing Johnson and Enrique as wing backs anyway. The defenders we've been looking at are all players comfortable in possession and capable of bringing the ball forward through the midfield, something that is really useful when playing 3-5-2. 

As for being weak against counter attacks, like I said, Enrique and Johnson are usually found past the half way line anyway, and if we did get caught on the break there'd be an extra CB who could go and attack the ball.

true,A_Rolling_Baneling,num26,,"If any? Mate we have the best U21 side in the EPL, doesn't matter what the final scoreline says. McEvoy, Bentaleb, Fryers, and Carroll - I'm sure two at least of these will be good players for our squad, wouldn't be totally surprised to see them all succeed. 

Fryers will get a lot of playing time if we don't sign a LB this summer (which I see being the case) and really if we see him as ready for rotation and sell one of Rose or BAE (again which I think is likely. Carroll's already began getting time at CM, and if we go to 433 which is not unlikely he'll see a lot of the pitch in a Modric-esque role. 

McEvoy and Bale on opposite wings - mouth watering. With Townsend coming back from a strong loan at QPR though his options are limited, but he's arguably got the biggest upside. Bentaleb's got Carroll to beat out before he'll see first team action, but he's an overlooked part of our youth set-up.

I say Veljkovic, Gomelt, Dombaxe, Modeste, Pritchard, Byrne, Galifuoco, Hall, Luongo, Nicholson, and Ceballos are in the next tier, where one or two might become squad players (hopefully better) for Tottenham as midfielders and defenders in the future. I know it's a lot of players, but they've all impressed at some point. It just takes more than talent to succeed at the next level, because lots of kids have talent, so we'll see who will progress and who won't. 

As for strikers, we're low on talent unlike everywhere else on the pitch. Funny how our U21 squad mirrors our first team woes. I hope that Dawkins, Coulibaly, Lancaster, Obika, and especially Coulthirst will become the answer to our misery, but realistically I don't see it happening. Hopefully one will develop into a useful forward behind someone we bring in this summer, but I'm not holding my breath. 

Have faith and be optimistic though fellow yids, it's looking great for our future. We just have to hope they don't get poached by big EPL sides with loads of foreign talent looking to meet the HG quota. Luckily the affluent two clubs I'm referring to have apparently good youth squads themselves, though they're not nearly the same caliber as ours or United's, or even Woolwich's or Liverpool's.

Didn't intend to write this much, but it was fun. Hope you enjoyed reading/learned about the best group of youngsters in England. I'd love to hear other opinions!

EDIT: For some reason, I thought the question was about academy players, not just every U21 player. Because of that, rule out Dawkins. I think the guy is like 25 already, and he's easily the lowest ceiling striker in development. In any case, I neglected to mention the four best candidates for EPL success on our squad because I consider them first teamers: Kane, Smith, Caulker, and Townsend. 

Kane is only 19, so he has an extremely high ceiling. He's injured often when out on loan, but if he can get a good amount of playing time in the next two years he's up there to be the next great academy product. Smith might be 22 actually, but he's had a good spell at Millwall. However, competing with Walker and Naughton for RB rotation when they have EPL experience and are nearly as young means his options at the squad are limited. 

Caulker will captain England and Tottenham one day, of this I'm sure. With Gallas on the way out, he'll rotate with our three excellent CBs who'll help mould him into a star. Beast of a defender, he's my new favorite youngster now that Bale and Walker don't count. Finally, Townsend. I've already mentioned that he's been brilliant at QPR, easily being their best player for the half season he was there. Expect him to bring width back into our side every time Lennon is our. He might have more potential for greatness than Caulker - hopefully he can overcome gambling addiction.

Shout-outs to the players who are just outside that age: Falqué and Livermore. They've got to demonstrate their worth to the squad, and fast. They're already as old as Walker, Rose, and Sigurdsson, who've shown top-flight ability, and they have younger equivalents at their heels. They are in career limbo.

The first point to note is that the current UK Government is trying very hard to reduce non-EU immigration to his country. They have an electoral pledge to reduce the numbers of immigrants down to fewer than 100,000 p.a. -- this pledge is as-yet unmet and they are likely to face increased political pressure on this over the next two years as the election approaches.

That having been said, with a PhD in a STEM subject you're probably better than 99.9% of would-be immigrants to the UK. The Government regularly publishes a ""Shortage Occupation List"" which is a list of jobs which industry here have been having trouble finding sufficient applicants to fill. The current list [is here](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf) (PDF), I'll let you decide if you feel you're suitably qualified for anything there.

If you are, that's excellent news. You can apply for one of those jobs and then if your job application is successful, you're in. You won't need to meet any other immigration requirement -- your prospective employer will still need to apply for a visa for you, of course, but it ought to be pretty much a formality.

If you're not qualified for any of those jobs, then unfortunately it becomes much, much harder. The [UK Border Agency](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/) has the full set of rules and requirements, unfortunately their site is awful to navigate (I suspect that's not an accident).

It sounds like you actually would prefer to stay in academia rather than industry; if that's the case then I'd suggest the route is very similar to a post-doc anywhere in the world -- make sure any papers you've written are as widely-distributed as possible, keep in touch with leading academics in the field, and apply, apply, apply. The UK has a thriving biochem and parmachology research sector in both industry and universities, so you should be in with a shot!

Only Ledley King, Sol Campbell and Steve Carr have come through and been regular, decent players in 20 years and that is shocking.

I used to have high hopes for Bostock, but i hear he is going to be released at the end of his contract. What a waste. But my new high hope is Souleymane Coulibaly. I've watched him a few times and some of the goals he scores are superb. I would love to see him given a go in the Capital Cup or Europa League.

 After all, it would be nice to actually produce a decent striker for once. I remember a guy said on a Radio call in a few weeks back that we might not have so many striker problems if we actually produced one, it could have been the difference in getting Champions League and that the last one we produced was Sol Campbell and he turned into a defender.

true,KyotoWolf,cnty-wales,Wrexham/Chester,"&gt; Firstly, which orange book are we talking about

The one actually titled The Orange Book, not the one titled 'Britain Under Blair: A Liberal Agenda' which happened to have an orange cover. The 1928 Yellow Book was co-authored by Keynes and largely represents the party re-inventing/re-asserting its social liberal values as a reaction to Labour  - it is not the economic liberalism the Orange Book refers to. I don't really understand your point here.

&gt; The problem for me with their spin on classical (or is it neo)liberalism, with its emphasis on ""choice"" and ""competition"" is that it's only about choice and competition in areas where capitalists want it

You're forgetting the emphasis of choice and competition on issues like local government reform, or other constitutional issues such as federalism, electoral, and Lords reform. You're also forgetting the Orange Book does not call for complete deregulation (regulation is necessary to maintain a 'free-market' and to prevent market failure). Further, the book envisions the public sector in competition with the private to provide the best service - something that 'capitalists' (what a fun word, I assume you mean it in a derogatory sense) would hardly be in favour of, along with regulation.

&gt; (or is it neo)liberalism

Considering neoliberalism was in part a return to a degree of classical liberalism, this is entirely redundant and only serves to create an emotional and ideological response by referring to a 'bad word'. 

&gt; Why do we have no competition amongst employers in offering greater workers' rights, greater benefits, larger pensions

There is competition in those regards, companies that offer those benefits are more likely to receive better candidates and are thus incentivised to offer them. I don't really see why you've written this though, it doesn't bear much relation to the Orange Book.

&gt; Why is it always a race to the bottom, unless we act act in combination and solidarity, and why do they always want to legislate such action away as an option?

Did you also miss the bit about local worker representatives negotiating with individual firms on issues such as working time? As to 'they also', you're essentially arguing against classical liberalism itself rather than the Orange Book with your post at this point - again, a little out of place.

&gt; hese are the fears that the original classical liberals rightly raised

and are the same issues discussed in the Orange Book, the main objective of which is reconciling classical liberalism with social liberalism, creating a balance between the two.",0,1369648084,null,0,1369649013,0,ca6rydr,t3_1f3099,t1_ca6rydr,t1_ca6ppas,null,1431019733,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anyway, if I may answer your question. I personally have one identity that encompasses both sides of my heritage, and the two countries that I've spent most of my life (UAE and UK). I do not like to shorten it to Scottish or Iraqi or British because that diminishes the nuances of your identity. 

Generally the sort of people who ask you where you are from take their cultural indentity for granted. Born and raised in same place by parents from the same place. So 'where they are from' is a question that carries a lot of implications. They think it tells you everything about that person, because actually where they themselves are from does answer quite a lot of questions.

But when you ask me where I'm from what are you asking me? Are you asking where my parents are from? Are you asking where I was born? What passport I have? What culture I identify most with? Where I consider home? What languages I speak? Who I support?

I have muslim colleagues at work and when I was talking to one of them about what happened (he's from the east end) he started saying that sectarian violence is rife in London but ""Sikhs are the worst for it, they'll just chop you up"". I don't for one second believe that to be true, but it gives an insight into different perceptions across cultures and faiths. 

It's not just Christians vs Muslims; it's theism vs atheism, old vs young, conservatives vs liberals, rich vs poor, educated vs uneducated, it goes on and on. It's where these differences become aligned that we see problems... Just as a generalised example - Rich old conservative Christians see comparatively poor young muslims as a threat because they cannot identify with them. 

I'm a relatively well educated young atheist. For me, the people I find it hardest to identify with are the ones that seek out differences in others in order to create scapegoats and to justify their own lack of morality and even more so with those that reinforce their views through violence. I think the EDL is an abhorrent organisation, it wouldn't bother me one iota if the majority of them were locked up. I also strongly believe that if and where possible, immigrants that commit crimes under our law, e.g. preaching hatred and encouraging violence against others should be deported . Those who follow them should leave this country if they don't abide by our laws, and if they don't they should face the consequences of them.

Place the cats feet through the holes (you may need to sedate the cat for this to work) such that the buttered side is *up* and the bottom, unbuttered side is level with the bottom of the cats paws. It then becomes a physical impossibility for the cat to to land on its feet and the toast to *not* land buttered side up at the same time, thus the cat can never land.

I also find the data signal where I live much better than Three. Whoever provides their network really seems to have upped their game recently, and I get 3.5G almost everywhere, even in really rural areas like where I live, this is actually almost as fast as the 4G that I've tried on EE.

Also the cost only being £12 per month for unlimited (**really** unlimited, not just ""unlimited but we'll cut you off if you exceed your fair usage policy), unlimited texts and 300 mins calls I personally feel is excellent value, plus I love not being tied into any contracts (have issues with contracts myself).

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;You're forgetting the emphasis of choice and competition on issues like local government reform, or other constitutional issues such as federalism, electoral, and Lords reform.

Not forgetting them, but how it plays out in these arenas will also undoubtedly reflect existing power, ownership and control structures, economic inequities, and so on.  We don't start from parity and there's no reset button.

&gt;You're also forgetting the Orange Book does not call for complete deregulation (regulation is necessary to maintain a 'free-market' and to prevent market failure). 

This potentially makes it worse. Without preventing the State from interfering with the market entirely, you allow those who control th State to use it for their own benefit, and who owns and controls the State?  We certainly don't live in any genuine sort of substantive democracy.  We have a semi-functional procedural democracy at best, and some would argue not even that.  It's true, to the extent that it can and does function in a genuinely democratic fashion the State can ameliorate some of the worst effects of a capitalist market, but without the first element it's pissing in the wind and all about regulatory capture, plutocracy/kleptocracy, cronyism, etc. etc. - just as we've seen over the last few decades as supposed ""privatisation"" and ""deregulation"" has occurred.  Deregulation and privatisation are often code for enriching those in the inner circle with the right connections.

&gt;the book envisions the public sector in competition with the private to provide the best service

The problem here is often that large corporations have huge departments devoted to tender writing, and whilst they don't have the skills and competencies t run good services, they can pay for consultation to write extremely convincing and thorough tenders which wipe the floor with the public sector agencies actually geared to delivering quality services.

&gt;'capitalists' (what a fun word, I assume you mean it in a derogatory sense)

Yes, its original derogatory sense.

&gt;Considering neoliberalism was in part a return to a degree of classical liberalism, this is entirely redundant and only serves to create an emotional and ideological response by referring to a 'bad word'

No, I think neo-liberalism is quite a specific thing, and worse by far than the classical liberalism it seeks to emulate in some ways.

&gt;For my own part, once I became a teenager I experienced severe and violent racism. The neo-Nazi para-military group Combat 18 began to target me and my friends. On a few occasions I was forced to watch as white friends were stabbed merely for being associated with me.

&gt;At 15, I was falsely arrested at gunpoint for playing with a plastic gun. This was the early 1990s, genocide was unfolding in Bosnia, while the international community failed to act. Add this to my own internal identity crisis – I didn’t know if I was British or Pakistani, Muslim or agnostic – and my disenfranchisement from mainstream society was complete.


This is I think important. The murders weren't carried out due to the nature of Islam which sits in a vacuum, but political and cultural greivances affecting adolescents in modern Britain.

I've tried to educate, but they just shrug me off as if I'm trying to make them look stupid. I'm not, I'm trying to educate you as to possibly *why* the media is the way it is, why the men did what they did, and what we can do to make sure everyone lives in peace and harmony (or at least strive for that - we'll never find peace so long as humanity exists! :P)

At work the other day, the two cleaning ladies (they aren't the brightest bulbs in the shop, but they seem nice enough) came out with this gem:

""I just finky it's lucky they weren't all dressed up in their like, full dress* cause that would have been worse. Like, what do you fink of when you fink of a Muslim? You fink of like, an Indian, don't ya, in like, full dress,""

*[I'm assuming she means a hijab - an Islamic women's dress http://www.islamicboutique.com/dresscode.asp] 

This goes to prove her ignorance.

Unfortunately she went on to say a load of shit that is essentially just regurgitations of slander she's heard on the tele and Facebook. Now, this lady doesn't hate, any more than a baby hates. How can it hate?

The apparent hatred comes from the media, and that is what the fucking problem is. Whatever the media's intent, I can only say what it *has* done, and that is it has divided us. I don't remember the last time racial tensions were this high. People are kicking off at Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, essentially if you have darker skin than your average EDL member, then people are getting angry. And for what?

England has been a multi-cultural country for a LONG time now. It's nothing new. Our country is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and currently with our national debt being 90% of our GDP, everyone is feeling the noose around their necks.

I've seen people who don't even know what the EDL stands for say, ""Well I don't like the way they go about it, but I do agree with the EDL.""

And that doesn't stop there. I am sad at the extremists from both parties. I am sad that extremists live on this planet that want to force their way of life onto anyone, be it forcing me to cover my skin up, forcing women to cover up (although I do agree with the Islamic teaching that women in western society are hugely sexualised, objectified, and essentially prostituted to advertising), all in the name of Allah. I am also sad that extremists want to kick out anyone who isn't White Anglo-Saxon Protestant from our country.

It is *our* country. All of us. Those that were born here, those that will die here, those that will have kids and grand kids and businesses and dogs. It is all of ours, so it is up to us to stand for *that*, if nothing else. 

And for goodness sake, bring the fucking troops home, and stop brainwashing them into believing what they are doing is right, and just. Our troops are killing and being killed for *nothing*. The occupation of the middle east is a corporate and political war being fought under the guise of bringing democracy and 'growth' to those nations. They aren't being fought for freedom.

And to OP - don't worry. There are far, far more people who know, than those that don't. You are likely not endangered. According to the Facebook page of the EDL, they have 126,000 followers. Compared to a country with a population of 65,000,000. Don't worry about it :)

Ok, I'll re-evaluate that because you do raise a good point.

Lack of knowledge can be easily rectified. The are books by the thousand available from libraries, internet resources by the million for every ingredient. I've given people simple recipes and they end up getting the bug pretty quickly.

true,heeb,null,null,"As a Dutchman, living in the UK, I largely agree with you. The UK is, for the most part, a very good place to live, work, study, or whatever else it is we want to be doing. Except for the weather, of course ;-) .

However, there are some worrying trends sometimes, such as the recent Theresa May plans for Internet communications monitoring. First of all, it is impossible to monitor all Internet traffic, for the simple reason that it is technically possible to end-to-end-encrypt communications. Using something like PGP, or GnuPG, I can send you a message if I have your public key, and only you can decrypt it. How is Theresa planning on stopping us from doing that? If she plans on monitoring identities of senders and receivers rather than message contents, there are ways of sending anonymous messages as well. Cryptography, done right, will enable any two (or more) parties to communicate securely, and no security agency will be able to stop us. She might make it *illegal* to use cryptography. Will that stop criminals or terrorists? Of course not. It will only stop law-abiding citizens.

We have to be vigilant. If we’re not, the UK might well end up becoming a police state.

Other than that, I feel very welcome here! Thank you people of Britain!

It genuinely bothers me tremendously that so many are so vocal and active in their hatred for muslims, the british, or simply anyone with a different skin colour to their own. I'm also disturbed at how much expose these people are getting; I understand that news organisations want to report this, but I feel like they may be causing such attitudes to spread, which is encouraging a move towards extremism on both sides of this ridiculous feud.

  But a lad mag is not a pornographic mag, FHM, Maxim etc is just similar to the womens mags that have lots of men in various states of disrobed-ness. ( although is the problem here that they don't usually have said men on the cover?? )

  The section where it says these magazines contribute towards violence to women, I do not understand at all, it's almost as if it's saying that being a man contributes towards violence to women. 

FHM contains male fashion, airbrushed photos of women and perhaps sport and gadgets, and tonnes of adverts, it is not a seedy porno full of disgusting attitudes to women, showing men pictures of hot women is not seedy.

 The womens / gay mags that show hot men, are they objectifying too? or is perhaps the *history* of female objectification the problem?

Strictly speaking you have to agree to arbitration, and agree to be bound by its decisions, it is NOT a matter of British law, and if you felt that the private service did not do its job you could then take your case into the law courts.  If moslem women are being forced in an unlawful manner then they have recourse to law. I am not suggesting all of them know this, and that alone should be grounds for its decisions not to be upheld, but believe it or not, many moslems want this option- men and women. It is legal- so unless we change the law  they stay, if we ban them by changing the law many other services go out too.  The argument as to how coercive they are, and how many moslem women are denied freedoms they want, and are entitled to is another argument.

However, I realised that you need people to say these things out loud, you need this reinforcement of our beliefs. Even if the number who don't condemn the attacks is a very very small minority, by have some a large outrage, continuous reinforcement of how inhumane these incidents are, you can affect the way that they believe. You make it very clear to them that what they're doing is wrong, and that nobody will support them. Plus, it makes us feel better knowing that everyone else agrees with you that it is enormously wrong, I guess.

It is more than just realising that not everyone is disgusted by the attacks. You can start with murderers, rapists etc. in this country, of which some have shown they have no qualms with doing with others as they please. Then you have those that just indifferent for various reasons or are conflicted. Finally, you will have those that support the attack. It's important to note, for our own happiness, that these groups of people are very small.

The entire reason we have politics - as opposed to some objective, scientifically based system - is that we accept there are situations where the right course of action cannot be known in advance. When there are significant unknowns, unprecedented and constantly changing circumstances, speculative markets, complex global interactions and a need to act quickly then *any course of action* will be an ""experiment"".

It's perfectly reasonable to disagree with the Tories decisions or their thought process. However, to use language of ""lab rat"" and ""experiment"" is extremely intellectually dishonest. It's also extraordinarily hypocritical to slam a viewpoint for not having sufficient basis in evidence by writing an article that is itself extremely thin on it. This kind of silly opinion piece disguised as fact feeds into the entire problem of a political discourse based on speculation and uncredited assertions that the audience must accept as fact.

http://www.zoopla.co.uk/heatmaps/

My place is a 3-bed house, and is worth a lot less than that, albeit in zone 6.

Personally, I can't see any reason to tie myself to any particular area of London - assuming you work in zone 1, that is... Transport's so good that it makes little difference to journey times. I have a friend who lives in a smaller house than me, worth 3 times as much as mine, in zone 2, whose journey into the city is only 10 minutes less than mine.

As for your main question, for me, it's a no-brainer, as long as you're aware of the risk. If you're buying it primarily for somewhere to live long-term, the risk is effectively mitigated, as you'll pay less than your rental, and after 25 years, you'll own it - even if it's literally worth nothing, you've still won out, as you've spent less than you would have, had you stayed in rented accommodation.

You seem to already be on top of your finances, but I would say that buying a place is such a huge thing that it forced me to start paying a lot more attention to my finances. I'm easily putting £1000 a month aside now, whereas before I bought the house, I'd ignore my bank statements, and it was only by dumb luck that I was living within my means (just).

Yaxley-Lennon [or ""Tommy Robinson"" as he prefers to be known, presumably because the double-barrelled surname sounds a wee-bit posh] has also gone on record numerous times, to defend the rights of LGBT people, and asserted his belief that Gay Marriage should have already been put into law.

true,lottesometimes,null,null,"Moving to Italy is very complicated. I lived there for almost 4 years so take into account:

- people's English skills are abysmal.
- getting a permit to stay (which you will need despite being a EU citizen) will drive you mad. Because you need a job to get one, to get a job, you need a permit to stay (see where this is leading?) and you also need a national insurance number (codice fiscale) which requires both job and permit to stay. I lied to them to get mine and break the circle, but I won't recommend that.

- there is no meritocracy. Baby boomers keep hogging jobs and once they had enough, give them to their kids. There's a reason why there's so many highly trained Italians working as waiters in London, and it's not the climate.

- The pay is terrible. Even those friends I had back there who had a good job (skilled work with postgraduate degree) made a pittance and moved abroad. Right now 7/10 have left the country. There's a good reason for that too.

Living in Germany can be a lot easier. If you have certain skills, finding a job won't be a big problem, especially not at a multinational, or a media company.

A colleague of mine has been living in Munich and he gets along without much knowledge of the lingo, but I still recommend learning if you plan to stay, as all tv programs and films are dubbed, and English language isn't commonly available for media outlets.

As cities I like Hamburg, Berlin and Cologne. Munich is not my favourite, but that may be because I always end up going there for work.

But Germany, here we go:

1) Hamburg: Hamburg isn't the cheapest in terms of rent, and probably not the sunniest, but the summers are still great, it's right by the harbour and the sea food prepared at the fish market and in the Portuguese restaurants is amazing. I like the bar culture the fleamarkets, and it's well positioned for trips to Denmark, Berlin etc.
It's got the highest density of affluent people in Germany, which is due to there being lots of Industry in the area. So it's also good for finding jobs! I considered moving there ears ago, but then ended up in London.

2)Cologne: It's got lots of students, lots of culture and a great bar scene. Also lots of jobs in the area and it's location is perfect for trips to the Netherlands, Paris, Belgium etc. It's also not cheap to rent, but manageable. My family lives 15 minutes away by train so I've grown up in the general area.

3) Berlin: It's probably one of the most popular places to go right now. Lots of culture, lots of stuff to do, still super cheap (coming from UK).
Jobs are a tad more complicated as the area of Germany is generally strugeling, but that heavily depends on what you do. Depending on Industry, it could be really easy!

4)Munich: I am not a fan personally, but other people love it. It's very close to Italy, great for skiing in winter and hiking in summer, the climate is great, and it's generally very pretty. Not as much going on as elsewhere but still a good bar scene. It's more expensive than the rest of Germany and renting is becoming increasingly problematic due to shortage. Food is generally a quite stodgy affair, heavy on pork.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"I know exactly where England is on a map, geographically, but honestly I'm not sure that as an American I'm sure what people over there consider ""anglo"" sometimes because I've already been corrected once, pretty much rudely told that even though they share a common ancestry I'm not supposed to consider people who live in that area as akin to each other. My understanding of the definition of UK, has been questioned several times and each time the person doing it had a different point of view about it all, depending upon where they were coming from. Wales, Scotland and Ireland all have had ties of sorts to England but I'm not allow to even acknowledge that without getting my head bit off.

When I think ""anglo"" I don't just think England. I also think of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, et all. I know that they're not all the same country, obviously, but the ancestry does have a lot in common and that's what I mean when I say I tend to like guys from over there. But ""anglo"" on a map and ""anglo"" to people in the various countries over there is often a pretty variable thing and I'm just not touching that question anymore. I know what it means to ""me"" but obviously there are a lot of people over there who think otherwise and I'm not into getting into a fuss over it again.

Define it for yourself. Whatever works for you, but for the record my ancestry is from several of those counties, and unlike a lot of Americans I have actually made an effort to try to understand a lot of the history of those countries, but it's a lot more convoluted than our history, and there's a lot more to mix up and potentially get wrong. I'm not going to deny that. I probably know more than a lot of people here about all that but I'm not perfect, shrug. Americans only have about 250 years worth of history that I had to learn here.

true,Rezdoggy,null,null,"Well, Reddit is certainly biased, varying depending on what subreddit you're in, and I am certainly no fan of the conservative party, but I think austerity is generally viewed as a bad idea. Or at least a bad idea by itself; cuts can be balanced with investment in other areas.

What you have to remember is that the two main parties have to appease those that have donated to them. Consider the NHS reforms and how many people protested, and still are protesting, them. Civilians and doctors alike condemned them, and condemned the tories for pushing them forward after they promised no reorganization of the NHS during the election. Except private health firms donated a lot of money to the conservative party (£1million+) and the party has to make sure their donors continue to see them as a good investment, otherwise who will fund their next election campaign? This, of course, assumes they have the interests of the country in mind to begin with. The other argument is that the parties have just become another wing of the lobbying industry and they're just doing their jobs; just not the jobs we wish they were doing.

And I suppose they get away with it because they have been doing this for a long time and are very good at it. Look at Nick Clegg and the LibDems; how on the morning of the second election debate all the papers that had aligned with the conservatives came out with the exact same story that smeared Clegg (and the Sky presenter referred to them during the debate), how the tripling of the tuition fees became a LibDem policy instead of a Conservative policy (Cameron appoints Cable Business secretary and then the papers deride them for ""voting against their own policy"") and how the AV vote became a vote against ""the traitor Clegg"".

They were known as top shelf magazines. By the time I was an adult they had a wrapper round them. Also around the same time FHM and Loaded and the like had arrived, and they were very tame compared to how things are now - no tits for example.

Over time the porn mags stopped being bought - I guess the stigma was too much - and over time the lads mags gained popularity, because people could pretend they were something else.

true,heeb,null,null,"&gt; I'm sure the next step would be banning crypto.

They can make certain uses of crypto illegal I guess. But not *every* use, because that would mean banning one of the most important uses of crypto, https, and thus any and all e-commerce and Internet banking. How well would the modern economy fare without those?

They could try and outlaw certain other uses of crypto (e.g. PGP / GnuPG / TrueCrypt), but they can never enforce it. Encryption done well looks like random noise with no distinguishable patterns. Even if they outlaw that (sending bit sequences that look like random noise over the Internet), we can always start hiding those random-looking bit sequences within other data, i.e. the fine art of [Steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). I could send you a (link to a) nice picture, or a (link to a) sound file, or video file, and if both the encryption and steganography are done right, no one will be able to tell whether it contains a hidden, encrypted message or not. Except for you, because you possess the private key associated with the public key that I used to encrypt the message I want to send you.

But somehow politicians always seem to be too ignorant to realise this. They don’t understand what is technically possible, and they come up with stupid laws as a result.

If you just read what I wrote you'd realize that these aren't estimations of worth. Noone thinks Suarez is honestly worth 70 million! I just think he's worth more than his market price to us as a team therefore it would take something astronomical for it to be worth it for us. This is because of our lack of CL football making it difficult to attract any top talent so essentially 70 mill would be just squandered on relative mediocrity. Plus we almost certainly wouldn't use the full 70 million given the debt at the club atm! So our squad would without a doubt become substantially weaker going into  a season that we all wanted to make a push for top 4.

I'm sure it's of no surprise to you that Amsterdam is touristy but I really wasn't expecting it to that degree.  It honestly has a distinct feel of Blackpool about it, albeit more picturesque.  There isn't really a centre to the city, it's very spread out which is a bit odd.  Obviously being a capital city it's going to be busy so there's that but it's busy with gaggles of tourists and a lot of idiots (our idiots largely) that are very much of the ""hur hur, weed and tits"" persuasion which gets old very quickly indeed.  There's obviously lots to do there but, being such a small country, you can never really get too far away from it so making day trips/weekend visits are so easy especially when you can get there in 25mins from Rotterdam, for example.  It's a very pretty place but so is the whole country and all the plus points of Amsterdam are available elsewhere without the many negatives.

With Rotterdam you get a more centralised and more modern city centre with everything you could want.  Great shops, eateries and lovely little bars all in a relatively small space (I sound like I work for the tourist board don't I?). The centre itself isn't as picturesque (due to the bombings in the war) but it has some great architecture and is a really pleasant place nonetheless.  There's so much going on here but it's so easy to get to other towns and cities too.  There's a sense being part of something too that I really can't put my finger on.  There's a really nice identity that goes with the city and you just feel part of it somehow something I think you'd obviously miss out on in Amsterdam.

I live in a really nice part of the city just outside the centre (tram takes less than 5 minutes to get there and it's definitely walkable) but even that short distance gives you a bit of peace and quiet.

 The squad needs more depth, but with Gerrard in the middle and Sturridge, Suarez and Coutinho leading the attack I don't really think we need a big name to come. Sterling will be back with less pressure on him. Borini is clearly a talented player who we haven't seen enough of and I think could become a potent weapon. 

 The two things we need to do to get a top four spot are conceed less goals and be able to rest our key players occasionally without weakening the team too much so that the players can remain fresh for the full season. I think the players OP listed will provide what we need without the risk of upsetting the balance of the team. If these players are brought in and and with the continued development of our young stars next season, it may be next summer, hopefully with champions league football assured, that we spend big on a couple of players to make a serious push for the title.

  Bringing in big names is not necessary as I am pretty certain that by the end of next season possibly Sturridge and certainly Coutinho will have risen to that level in the minds of football fans. 

  This summer we can't compete with the Champions League teams for players, but we are lucky enough to have some immensely talented players already in our squad who want to play for us. I'd only go for a big name if Suarez leaves, but getting anyone of similar quality without Champions League football will be almost impossible.",0,1369679411,null,0,false,0,ca6ylqv,t3_1f4qb5,t1_ca6ylqv,t3_1f4qb5,null,1431016527,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Reasons why judgements may not be made public (""secret"") - to protect the identities and confidentiality of those who lack consent. In this case an adult who has advanced dementia, or more often in the case of children.

I.e. If the court of protection decides to take a child away from an adult who is sexually abusing them, the court may decide that it is in the best interests of the child for that judgement not to be made public for the childs privacy. (vs interests of society to know the outcome).

With regard to the case on the report. Social services are not obligated to provide what they feel will be unsafe care. If they don't think they can provide care safely for the patient in the patients home, they have a right to refuse and suggest alternative care arrangements (i.e. a care home). The relatives have the right to contest this and have it independently judged - which they have through the court of protection. Just because the relatives do not agree with the outcome does not mean it is the wrong decision.

Lots of this speculation actually has a basis. I'm with you as far as that we shouldn't speculate off sources like goal.com or caughtoffside.com but when a rumour emerges from a credible source why shouldn't the fans offer their opinion on that player? It's part of the fan experience. This would be a dull subreddit if we only commented on what happened. As far as the Suarez thing goes I personally haven't seen it ""rehashed"" in this particular way (how much would you take for him).. And if you have don't fucking comment.. It's that simple. If you don't like the things people talk about on this subreddit don't fucking use it, even simpler! You won't be missed with that attitude.

If anything i think we would all be damn lucky to get a really good 2 and a half hour movie of the time war. 

As for The Doctor you have the current doctor (Matt Smith) with some plot point where he breaks into the locked time war for whatever reason( rescue a companion, time being tampered with, whatever), this would be how the audience gets to experience it and where the studios feel relaxed since its not a gamble casting different doctors to hold up an already risky movie.

true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"I disagree on this. We've strengthened the side since he broke through in September so there is less responsibility on his shoulders. He was a 17 year old starting every game in a key attacking position. The pressure to perform regularly and consistently at his peak was immense. Next season, he will be able to just go out and play when he's picked, and there are now more players to share the burden of creating chances. Before he dropped, you could see that playing with a minor injury and playing so regularly at such a young age had taken its toll. He wasn't relaxed on the pitch. Next season he'll be able to play football regularly but not to the point of fatigue. If he's not at his sharpest, he'll have the luxury of a day off. He'll be able to focus more on developing his talents and I think we'll see him playing with more freedom and confidence than before. At 18, having a little competition for your place is a good thing. I think he and Ibe will spur each other on at Melwood, and both improve as a result. Henderson, although he doesn't play every game, is an already established player who can play in a variety of positions, so he's not a threat. Certainly, we all expect him to improve on a great first season, but at his age we want him to be enjoying his football and playing a high energy game which, mentally and physically, he is too young to do every week.",0,1369683248,null,0,false,0,ca6zs5a,t3_1f4qb5,t1_ca6zs5a,t1_ca6z16p,null,1431015901,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,YupsterSlayer,null,null,"I'm neither an atheist nor a liberal apologist, so despite my inclination I commend the level of insight in your post. You got most of it right.

Two objections. One is that it is more than just scapegoating- the people they hate are in GENERAL a net negative influence on society. It is unfortunate, but for the greater good, the decent ones may be swept away with the bad ones. You may note that there are probably less decent ones than you think, they just don't advertise it. To put it another way, if a group of people are 70% neutral and 30% actively destructive, and the neutral ones are doing next to nothing about the bad ones, it may be best to replace that group entirely. Particularly given that even if these people aren't actively destructive, a large portion of them promote values that are in opposition to modern Western values. The effect of such is subtle but significant. The latter reason is a reason that the ""bigots"" have so much trouble with the ""leftards"". In that the ""bigots"" tend to actually interact with the portion of the immigrant group that is a problem (say 80%) because like the ""bigots"", they are lower class. The problem this 80% represents is a subtle one of culture and values based on personal experience and intuition about social trends that is hard to articulate given that most ""bigots"" tend to be less intellectual or educated. The ""leftards"" interact with the 20% of the immigrants who are upper class (elite) or so, who are for most intents and purposes, whitewashed or will be in a generation or two. In some cases the ""leftards"" don't interact at all with the immigrant group and use charicatures from media with a liberal bias to form opinions on the group, in combination with a natural human tendency to assume other people have a certain level of decency and the guilt over past colonisations, which leads to ""leftards"" being out of touch with the reality of the situation due to their being removed from the reality by virtue of their privelege of being part of the intelligentsia. It is for a similar reason women tend to be left leaning- they tend to be more sheltered from the reality which the ""bigots"" face every day. The ""leftards"" overintellectualize everything and assume they understand a group of people by their theorycrafting, when it is the every day sort of interactions with the main group of a people that form the truest representation of those people- the sort of interactions the ""bigots"" have, but are unable to articulate to the elite ""leftards"", because the ""bigots"" underintellectualize things due to having a different set of values or being born into a lower class with less upward mobility. Compounding this problem is the tendency of the main group of immigrants who are in general problematic to behave more civilly or sycophantically towards the ""leftard"" group than the ""bigot"" group when they interact with them due to the nature of lower/upper class interactions and lower/lower class interactions. As history has shown, upper/upper class interactions have rarely been socially defining, as the comfort of upper class is demotivational.  The ""leftards"" with some sense, like yourself, who are not full retard are drowned out by the most extreme ""leftards"" and likewise with the ""bigots"". Just like ""leftards"" can be egregiously naive and delusional, ""bigots"" can be, well, bigots and degenerate. Usually you can tell if someone is really a bigot by whether they hate all ethnic groups or if it's just the problematic ones. You're either an independant or an idiot, I like to think.

In sociology it should be noted that the louder the extreme gets of a group, in general, the more supportive the group is of the ideals of the extreme. And the more the extreme is done, the more that extreme represents the holistic nature of that group. Extreme is like... super hot sauce. The amount it takes to make the group out to be like the extreme is relatively small, but in general this small amount is not invalidated in the sense of being representative, due to the sociological dynamic of extremism and the mainstream that cultivates it. The ""actions of a few"" argument does have merit, but after a certain point common sense must prevail with the realisation that after the tenth murder in the name of Allah in as many weeks, that the group from which these extremists come tends to represent degenerate values. It has been said that liberalism is a mental disorder, and sometimes that's not far from the truth. If a people wearing red suits steal from you in 70% of your interactions with them, it would be delusional to not change you approach to interacting with them in the name of not offending anyone. A mental disorder it seems, because it is really hard to justify that behavior with common sense. While ""leftards"" are delusional, ""bigots"" are just plain dumb or sociopathic. I would go as far as to say there is a higher percentage of really bad ""bigots"" than ""leftards"", but on the other hand, I think there is also a higher percentage of really good ones too. I could explore this spiritually, but that's beyond scope.

So what's the solution? Well it's not the ""final solution"". But it's gonna take some balls and willpower to enact. Unmitigated free speech should be reduced. Yes. Limit free speech. It's not as bad as it sounds. Establish what your national values are and deem significant social opposition to those values are unacceptable. People have to stand for SOMETHING other than just letting other people stand for something. That free speech ideal is the poison in the progressive mentality. A lot of good comes with it, but the great good it brings also brings a lot of bad- that version of progressivism is like what communism is to socialism. So establish those good old Western values as unassailable national ideals- you know, free market, not harming the environment, freedom of expression, opposition of hatred, ""humanism"" (Christian values), solidarity, egalitarianism (and opposing the poison in it that results in it opposing itself), progress and reason. So once these are established there is A LOT of room for growth and progress, but the extreme of the self defeating aspect which is the tolerance of thirld world and degenerate mentalities is curtailed, and with it, the power of the groups who worsen the first world. In practice this means disallowing significantly seditious and unethical social activities. Yes, making it illegal. Balls. Banning questionable Imams. England is about the English, not everyone- because there is the correct assumption that they may have it more right than a third world shithole. So to do this, one simply finds the Imams who oppose these values and warn them to stop. If they do not stop, deport them (if they are citizens, bribe a middle eastern country into taking them, find a way. Worst comes to worse, imprison them). Ruthlessly quell the inevitable riots (ruthlessly so they don't get worse). Balls. Then, in accordance with the national value of solidarity, mandate a single language to be spoken in public- English. Require nationalistic education courses to become citizens. Reduce MENA immigration by 80% and screen applicants more. Sharply increase the penalties for immigrant crime and crimes of a particular degenerate nature (honor killing, acid attacks, etc). Invest more in social programs for said immigrants so that they break the cycle of poverty/degeneracy that they were born into. Increase police presence and investment into ghetto-ized areas. Ban immigrant only schools. Balls. Increase funding for domestic anti-radical task forces. Affirmative action, give it a shot. That's a good start. When the latter is done, or strong action is taken along those lines, England may very well once again become ""jolly old England"" in a generation or two. If things continue in the liberal enabling vein they are, the country will turn into two countries within one. The haves (mostly white) and the have nots- (persons of color and lower class whites). Sort of like Children of Men.

- Outfit choice: While bikinis are common in both, lingerie is relatively more common in Zoo (including in heels &amp; stockings combos), and topless/braless posing is dramatically more common (11 out of 21 here, on the first set of google image search results from above if I turn off Safe search so they all show up). While there is very little practical difference from the point of view of what is exposed in a given image, the societal context of this is very different.
- Composition &amp; Branding - combined with the above, the covers are, by and large, much more focused on single, intentionally evocative images, together with emphasis on things like ""Topless!"" and ""World's best boobs!"" This clearly indicates different intents behind the different magazine's approaches and presentation.

As a thought experiment - if you were shown a random selection of cover images for Heat and Zoo, or even just single photos used as part of the covers, how readily do you think you would be able to associate them to their parent magazine? I suspect it's close to 100% - there are clearly differences between these covers beyond them all containing ""women in bikinis"", which it's doing everyone a disservice to not acknowledge.",0,1369686016,null,0,false,0,ca70mmj,t3_1f4tg2,t1_ca70mmj,t1_ca6zbq6,null,1431015502,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But someone is encouraging you to. If you go abseiling, sky diving, go-karting, you know it is dangerous but you expect unnecessary danger to have been removed. You expect the brakes to work on the kart.

The cheese rolling organisers still owe the competitors a duty of care, to protect them from unnecessary danger. You might accept the risk of breaking your arm, but you would expect the organisers to make sure the hill wasn't steep enough to create a risk of very serious injury, and that they only allow a safe number of people to join in, and they cancel if weather conditions.

If someone breaks their neck, which looks to be a possibility, then they wouldn't be able to shrug it off (literally or figuratively). They would have to sue the organiser's insurer to get money to help with their disability. The organiser has insurance, right?

Now that we've had the badassery of Mr Kilmister it's time to move onto something more brutal. It's time for... [Rattenfänger!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5agpoXAfmRc)

You like that? Maybe not. Let's mellow out a bit then and pretend we're listening to Skeletor from He-Man with a little bit of [Manilla Road](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWvQVln9fAU).

So we heard death metal with Rattenfänger but what about black metal I hear you say? Don't worry. We can cover that with a little bit of [Venom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fHmzFVDjVnM#t=15s) for the first wave and some [Mayhem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VIhIIq-kk) for the Norwegian dominated second wave.

Finally, let's finish with a classic (not that Manilla Road isn't). Let's finish with some [Iron Maiden.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7ToNJHgp-w)

A 4-3-3, with the midfield 3 in 1-2 formation, of Lucas at the base and Gerrard and Allen/Hendo in front of him could work. Suarez and Coutinho would be on the wings in that formation and Sturridge at CF. Rodgers has used that formation when he wants to control us the game in the past.

Well in 2-1 Allen would play at the top of the triangle, Gerrard doesn't have the legs for it anymore.

Also, we don't expect people born and bred here to ""integrate"".  I don't particularly integrate that well and my family have been here for centuries (maybe).

The only thing to be done is to arrest criminals for the crimes that they commit, not start deporting people that happen to share demographics with criminals.  If a white christian murdered someone in the name of religion, we wouldn't be demanding the exile of all white christians.
