They support kids and families that are undergoing cancer treatment in London. 

&gt; By making an online donation you can help us make a difference to teenagers living with cancer….

&gt; £10 means Harry Potter can help Hayley through her chemotherapy. This could buy books or a DVD for one of our wards. A simple thing, but it can help distract and entertain a young person whilst they go through hours of drug therapy.

&gt; £35 means there won’t be an awkward silence when Ross’s friends come to visit him. Visiting someone in hospital can be hard, especially for young people. £35 could buy a video game, so when friends come to visit, young cancer patients can do normal teenage things - there’s no need to sit around the bed looking uncomfortable.   

&gt; £100 means that Steven can have bangers and mash at 3am. When you’re having treatment for cancer, you’re not always hungry at mealtimes. £100 could buy a microwave to ensure young cancer patients can have a hot meal whenever they need it.  

&gt; £200 could help eight teenagers feel human again. Cancer treatment can be stressful, scary and draining for young people. £200 is enough to fund eight complementary therapy sessions, such as massage or acupuncture, to help young people relax and recover from the stress of dealing with treatment.  

&gt; £1,500 means Amy doesn’t have to spend her first night in hospital alone. This could fund somewhere for relatives to sleep overnight, meaning young patients can have their mum, dad, partner or friend close by during this frightening time.

Yes, Mickey and Rose's relationship is a mess, but that's not all on Rose. Mickey was a pretty shitty boyfriend, wanting to go to the pub to watch football a couple of hours after his girlfriend nearly died in an explosion. And yes, Rose arguably ditched Mickey in ""Boomtown"", but well, Mickey HAD been seeing other girls and I think in her mind, she was setting him free. Their relationship was definitely one where they were together because it was comfortable and not because they really wanted to be there. And the messiness of it and how Rose didn't necessarily handle it in the best way is part of what makes her a great character. She's flawed. She's nineteen years old. She sometimes makes relationship mistakes.

By fuck with the schism, I'm assuming you mean the fact that she was building a vortex canon? Sure. Ok. Yes, she did. But it wasn't the vortex canon that cause the barriers between the worlds to break down so......

Clearly the Doctor ages, though it's only really noticeable in *Last of the Time Lords* (and blatantly so). But with WWTWS, what can age can also be made younger...

Imagine, then, that Eight regenerated into Nine (as Hurt)... perhaps forcibly, perhaps because of trauma (possibly marking the start or height of the Time War). And for reasons yet to be revealed, Hurt ended up de-aging into... Eccleston.

More specifically, Eight regenerated into Nine (Eccleston) who aged slowly or quickly into Hurt (time locks and bubbles and other nasty business can really put on the years), and in seizing ""The Moment"" a time loop of sorts was created. By pinching the entirety of the Time War off from the rest of reality (in a way that destroyed both Daleks and Time Lords) Eccleston (as the younger Nine once more) went on, while Hurt remained a divergent Ninth Doctor... lost perhaps... an abandoned timeline. Excised thus, he is both the Doctor and not the Doctor.

Edit: And yes, one could disavow the actions of their now-future-self, their divergent self, and feel responsibility while forswearing that never-was action.

Edit2: Looking at the miscount thread I see I'm not the only one thinking along these lines... though I think the idea of Nine closing off a rogue/defunct part of his own timeline is novel.

...

*Then again, anything that might allow Eight a bit more screen time would be worth it to me. :-D (Big Finish Eight, not movie Eight...)*

I disagree. I wouldn't say they hadn't lost form, because I don't really think they have had any this season yet. They were defending excellently in the first three games, and scored what they had to. However in the last 5 games, they drew with Swansea and 10-man Newcastle, and lost to Southampton, at home. Those are all teams they MUST beat if they want top 4, and they don't, which is why I said that they would fall behind the top 4, which leaves at 5th, which makes us their direct opponent (Depending of course, on what happens with United).

* it was commissioned in 1204 after the King lost control of Normandy but retained the Channel Islands and was built on Cornet Island off the harbour of St Peter Port.

* During the civil war the island declared for parliament but the castle remained loyal to the crown, so the castle used to bombard the island with its canons and there were constant skirmishes. 

* In 1672 the castle's keep was struck by lightening which ignited the gunpowder stores and blew up the keep, chapel and great hall which were never rebuilt. The blast killed the governors wife and child as well as several others.

* During WW2 when the island was occupied by the Germans, the castle was bolstered with concrete bunkers and anti aircraft stations

* During the cold war, Castle Cornet hosted an MoD / MI5/6 listening post or signal station, something along those lines, not sure which. It was decommissioned some time in the 90's",0,1382520593,null,0,false,0,ccxr91q,t3_1p0ads,t1_ccxr91q,t3_1p0ads,null,1429016105,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

They charge more because business services tend to have much better support, better SLAs, and will buy BT's TotalCare product which gets an engineer out very quickly if the problem needs someone.

true,sammyslug,cnty-england,Police Officer AMA!,"In theory I am fully behind this idea, indeed I would love the opportunity to have a video camera whilst working. It gives me great evidence, stops malicious complaints, and could help increase trust in the police. All good things.

Unfortunately there are issues to be worked out.

1) Do you have it record constantly? You say don't record during scheduled breaks. I don't get scheduled breaks, I take 5-10 minutes here and there which are usually interrupted to go to another job. I don't fancy being recorded going to the loo for example. Do you allow officers to turn on and off the recording? Well that's great until someone innocently forgets to turn it on, or maliciously, and then a complaint is made. What if an incident occurs that was not expected, for example walking down the street and come across something and you rush to deal with it and omit pushing the record button. 

Also you have to deal with a lot of people. Already some victims of crime, domestic violence/abuse and sexual offences, find it hard to talk to the police and will only tell us information that they don't want to use in evidence but just need to tell someone. Having that recorded could lead to their trust being betrayed as we are obliged to investigate crime and it could be used against their partner/suspect, or it could lead to people just not talking to us at all.

Or imagine you have some information about a drug dealer living near to you and you want to tell the police. Before you could stop a police officer walking down the street, give them some information but remain effectively anonymous. Now your image and voice will be stored making it possible to identify you a lot easier.

2) Storage. It's not just a case of storing 10 hours of 720p footage a shift. The storage has to be secure and with no risk of tampering. The slightest suggestion that it has been tampered with or corrupted could lead to a court case failing. It has to be reliable. There needs to be the ability to search and index footage. And we need a camera capable of recording high quality audio and video for a full 10 hour shift if necessary (I have before gone to a job at the start of the shift and not finished dealing with it for the entire shift). These are some mega batteries that will be required.

3) Equipment. I carry around a lot of equipment, and it gets heavy. I have a radio, a PDA, a phone, a baton, gas, handcuffs, radio battery, ticket books, printer (for PDA), some officers have Taser, and more. Where does all this extra equipment go?! It needs to work in pouring rain, bright sunshine, whilst fighting/climbing over things/running/etc.

4) Privacy. If you go to a burglary victim do you need to record it? If someone requests the footage do we have to supply it under Freedom of Information? Can someone request your entire shift? Is that like stalking an officer, for example someone who holds a vendetta against someone requesting every shift for one officer and watching to see one tiny mistake to catch them out on. Yes officers should be subject to scrutiny but we all make mistakes or might say things we shouldn't/didn't mean. Does your burglary victim get their house and report given out when footage is requested? What about domestic victims? Children who have been assaulted etc? What power would the police have to record in private premises anyway if the owner refused?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Do you allow officers to turn on and off the recording? Well that's great until someone innocently forgets to turn it on, or maliciously, and then a complaint is made

then their negligence stopped them from doing their job properly, and they should be disciplined just for that whether complaints are made or not. I'm not sure how cases are handled when there's no hard evidence either way now, but they presumably are, so it's presumably possible to figure out whether or not the officer was overly violent even if the camera is off.

&gt;. Already some victims of crime, domestic violence/abuse and sexual offences, find it hard to talk to the police and will only tell us information that they don't want to use in evidence but just need to tell someone.

So make it possible for them to ask for you to turn the camera off while they talk. 

&gt;Storage. It's not just a case of storing 10 hours of 720p footage a shift. The storage has to be secure and with no risk of tampering.

Secure storage and indexing are nothing new. I'm no expert but there's a way of encrypting files called asymmetric encryption, which allows you to know exactly how to encrypt a file, but not have any idea how to decrypt it. You'd give the public key (for encrypting footage) to the police station, and keep the private key secure somewhere- possibly itself encrypted until a court says it can be opened and the footage can be accessed. Change the key every 24 hours so at no point is there a significant amount of footage at risk of being decrypted, and you're golden.

As for making sure all footage relevant to a case gets included, all you'd have to do is look at every call an officer responded to over that day and tag footage from that point up until the point of the next call as possibly relevant. Keep a record of whether a tag exists for a set day of film from a station unencrypted, so if a case needs to be reviewed you know which parts to decrypt. 

&gt;Equipment. I carry around a lot of equipment, and it gets heavy. I have a radio, a PDA, a phone, a baton, gas, handcuffs, radio battery, ticket books, printer (for PDA), some officers have Taser, and more.

I absolutely get what you're saying, but compared to most of this stuff a shoulder mounted camera weighs hardly anything. A gopro lasts about 2.5Hrs on a battery the [size of a box of matches](http://www.parkcameras.com/23082/GoPro-HD-HERO-2-Li-Ion-Battery.html?referrer=Froogle&amp;gclid=COOe6e3arLoCFSXItAodbS4ASA) and 4 of those on your belt (or even in the camera itself, might as well splurge and get some custom made just for this) wouldn't weigh much or hinder mobility at all. Storage is basically a non-issue with 32/64GB SD cards

&gt;If you go to a burglary victim do you need to record it?

yup, then you stick it in an encrypted file and nobody looks at it unless a court says they can.

&gt;If someone requests the footage do we have to supply it under Freedom of Information? 

I doubt it- to be able to actually comply with a FoIA request you'd have to keep a record of the name of everyone you filmed, and to be able to do that you'd have to have the legal right to record the name and whereabouts of every person you saw. There are already [23 exemptions](http://www.justice.gov.uk/information-access-rights/foi-guidance-for-practitioners/exemptions-guidance) to the FoIA including a blanket exception [for intelligence agencies](http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/information-access-rights/foi/foi-exemption-s23.pdf) and [another](http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/information-access-rights/foi/foi-exemption-s31.pdf) exempting any information that would if disclosed reduce the chance of catching/charging anyone as well as a bunch of other things handing out recordings of witnesses would probably prejudice.

&gt;or example someone who holds a vendetta against someone requesting every shift for one officer and watching to see one tiny mistake to catch them out on. 

if someone files complaints against an officer constantly now, do they all get taken seriously? 


&gt;What power would the police have to record in private premises anyway if the owner refused?

If you believe a crime is taking place, you can investigate as you would without a camera but with a camera on. If nobody is charged make it possible to request the recording is deleted. Much like you can't just walk into someone's house now, you wouldn't be able to do it with a camera on, and any circumstances that did justify you being on that private property would justify a recording too.

I'm not an expert and I won't pretend I understand the complexity or cost of setting this kind of system up, but I fully believe it would be possible to make it work, and it would be worth doing as well. Imagine if everything every officer said in court could be backed up with physical video evidence, it would make prosecution heaps easier. Even if it didn't affect the number of people claiming to have been abused by the police it would be completely worth it.

tl;dr 

- you don't have to record yourself going to the loo, you could stop recording if someone asked you to so they could speak to you. 

- There are no security issues we can't solve with existing technology, we can make the system effectively tamper proof

- Cameras are very light and don't affect mobility

- Treat the footage as secret, don't let anyone see it without court approval and let police record on private property against the owner's wishes if (and only if) they see something criminal.

We have some cracking examples of big architecture there with a beautiful variety of designs.  Some of the ruins are really worth a visit too, and then there are hybrids where part is ruined and part isn't.  

I don't think all our castles are as exciting as they might be, perhaps because we gravitated to a nice country house and gardens instead of the turrets and battlements, and thus lost the idea of a modern castle.  Where that still exists, in places like Windsor, it's great!  But if you want to see some really excellent castle/mansions, France has some superb examples, especially ones which have different areas for different periods, and they're often restored to a beautiful series of layouts where you can look and see the different eras etc in the stonework and interior design.  That sort of thing is rare in the UK, unless they're basically private homes and only open fairly rarely.  However, Stirling Castle does a pretty good job, so that's well worth a visit.

I currently live in York, so I'd obviously recommend a walk on the walls and then a look inside the Minster.  However, my parents live in Wiltshire, where the attractions are different: you could drive by Stonehenge, which is nice to see at least once, and that's definitely the most famous of our attractions, but individual towns often have interesting places: a town my parents live in, Malmesbury, has an excellent 12th century abbey which is part-ruined and partly used, but it also has various other architectural things to do and see which the townspeople like to talk about.",0,1382527137,null,0,false,0,ccxs46j,t3_1p0ads,t1_ccxs46j,t3_1p0ads,null,1429015702,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I can't say myself I had any disappointment with this series and realise now that I am drawn to it less because of the people but more to the idea of producing something at least as good if not better than they do. 

That being said people seem to forget Ruby is only 21 and was not groomed for TV like an actor. I viewed her reactions as quite genuine as I have personal experience of friends equally going to pieces when cooking for a dinner party when I was in my 20's. Confidence is not given it is won through hard work and perseverance. It is only a fool who says they can learn without making mistakes.

I particularly liked the final episode though, because going into the final it really was a who's better, who's best scenario. I kept on hearing about Ruby winning and personally I was not convinced, because we have already seen how nerves get to her, And why not? This was the **FINAL** after all. With experience will come confidence it is just a shame that people have to be nasty to her because her learning curve was all out in public. 

It is kinda shallow though to cite sexism because it was an all women final. Seriously which of the men would have had a chance in that final. None come to mind for sure.

Whether that's because she is or because the program makers have found a narrative they like and are running with it is impossible to know... but the fact is they never seem to have trouble finding footage of her in tears, or whinging about *something* the whole time.

not driving into *stationary* objects is 100% up to you, as a driver. If you hit a *stationary* object, it is because you drove into it. You are completely at fault. Your lack of skill is the complete, only cause of the accident. Your viewpoint is ignorant of the fact that a good driver would not drive into a *stationary object* then blame *someone else*.

You could say all roadsides should be fitted with 20m of impact absorbing foam so bad drivers could bounce into that instead of pedestrians and buildings, but considering it would cost money to carve 20m of roadside away, and the only people who would benefit would be bad drivers, that's not a good use of public money.

&gt;At the heart of this technology is the concept of information storage. Through a proprietary process, 'information' in the form of subtle energy patterns is stored in a hologram which serves as a primary 'carrier' material. This hologram is structurally modified on a subatomic, quantum or subtle energy level when the product is encoded or programmed. When this subtle energy pattern or program is absorbed into the hologram, the material is permanently vibrationaly patterned. Once imprinted the hologram transmits or radiates this coherent energy 'pattern' which has a variety of positive effects, depending on the specific use.

At the same time you say the articles that claim there is a risk are rubbish and should be ignored **but you offer no support for your rubbishing of the risk**.

I don't know and I wouldn't want to speculate on that.

I think you missed my point, I said you could provide something that isn't related to NI but would prove eligibility - e.g. proof of residence, ID card, EHIC card, passport/visa, etc.

&gt; I totally support the idea of reserving the NHS for the people who are entitled. And the thought of people using it for free pisses me off. But if we are concerned about saving money, you have to weigh up the cost of doing business (i.e. losses by theft) vs the cost of enforcement and related consequences.

Indeed, but it doesn't seem like it would cost tens or hundreds of millions to do this (the savings that the government claims would be made if there was better enforcement).

&gt; For example, old people (who are by far the largest users of the NHS) are never going to remember to bring documentation with them to the doctors or the hospital.

Edit -- 

Stats. Shots per Game

Suarez 5

Sturridge 3.4

Giroud 3.9

Aguero 2.6 (Surprisingly low but would have loved us to buy him when we always wanted him)

Dzeko 3.4

RVP 3.9

Rooney 2.9

Eto'o 3

Totaling 11 players who shoot more than Torres in our team alone.

Final edit. Looking at the other top teams (+liverpool) stats every single one of them their strikers top their shots per game lists. You can argue however you want.

No, but by this point in time, all of that was still in Clara's future and the Doctor thought of her as nothing more than a curiosity. Your explanation would go a long way to explain why the leaf is so powerful, but it doesn't explain why either of them *think* it's so powerful at the time. It seems like it was just dropped as a given, like oh yeah, anyone who travels with the Doctor is ultimately going to be infinitely more important than the rest of the ""little people."" ""She may not be important yet, but we all know she will be eventually so just roll with it."" It kind of goes against the general atmosphere of the show in my opinion, which is that the little people are important. That's why it irritated me and I wasn't happy with the given reasoning.

Well, that kinda IS the entire issue. If it was super simple, we could just require everyone to show proof and there would be zero fraud/theft of NHS services. Obviously the whole issue is whether the cost of enforcement is worth the savings.

&gt;I think you missed my point, I said you could provide something that isn't related to NI but would prove eligibility - e.g. proof of residence, ID card, EHIC card, passport/visa, etc.

Sure, but is the average GP receptionist or doctor supposed to understand the many different types of proof and odd exceptions to the rules that people will have? And think of all the people who will forget to bring proof, or not have the right papers, causing missed appointments and delays that might be more costly than just treating them.

&gt;So make it a one-time thing as part of the first visit, or after the appointment and then record that the patient is eligible for NHS care.

We already tried an NHS database and it was a tremendous failure. I think asking every NHS facility to store records of patient eligibility is impractical - especially when people move around

IMO, the solution is to simply target the places which are most abused - likely major hospitals in big cities. Employ 1-2 people in those hospitals to chase up on people who require the most expensive treatments. I don't think it's possible to effectively stop illegal immigrants or non-EU citizens from getting a prescription from a GP, but we can definitely stop people from getting heart surgery without paying.

One of the most common areas for NHS fraud is giving birth, which can be very expensive in other countries. Pregnant women come here to give birth in an NHS hospital, then disappear.

&gt;you don't have to record yourself going to the loo, you could stop recording if someone asked you to so they could speak to you.

You're either recording all the time, or you're not. You put one edge case in, you'll have to define all the variables or go for the 'treat it like the pocket notebook' (which is 'fill out what you need to fill out to justify your actions')

&gt;Cameras are very light and don't affect mobility

And the ones that are very light will be the worst performing and/or the most expensive. They'll also have bugger all battery life, unremovable memory cards or, in the worst cases, have a tendency to burst into flames. This is public sector procurement writ large. We're not going on amazon here (not to mention that a project this large would almost certainly require advertising in OJEU, so that's the complicated tender process guaranteed).

&gt;Treat the footage as secret, don't let anyone see it without court approval and let police record on private property against the owner's wishes if (and only if) they see something criminal.

1) Secret? *Actual*, national security marked secret? Because now we're getting into a whole raft of GCHQ/CESG complications which would make any proposed system unwieldy and, frankly, mental.

2) Now, private property. How would you define that? Rail stations are private, but they're also public. The courts are public buildings, but it's illegal to film in a sitting court. What about a car park? How about a shopping centre? Pubs? Schools? Colleges? University buildings? What about a house of multiple occupation? Dwellings? Front gardens? Who is the owner? What about tenants? What about the agents of the owner, or the occupier? How do you secure that agreement? What if they change their mind while filming? How do you record the agreement? Will their be a statutory form of words? Who will monitor it? What recourse at law will their be?

What about 'ooman rights? Article 8, and all that (for both the police officers and the public).

Whilst at first (and second, and third) glance I might appear to be being facetious, I'm only half joking. It's not as simple as just giving coppers a load of go-pros and telling them not to switch them off under pain of discipline (What happens when a camera stops working? How will you tell?

Even if a couple hundred Brits start to loosely follow the 49ers (reasonable expectation, IMO), there is a HUGE amount of potential for that fanbase to grow in the upcoming years. Much like investing in young talent, the 49ers are putting their bets on what might potentially be.

As a Spurs supporter (rather new, admittedly), I'm more excited about Spurs popularity growth in the US. NBC's PL coverage has noticeably increased PL awareness here in the States, so there's more people looking for a club to support. The 49ers are one of the best teams to partner with. They already have arguably the largest fanbase in California and one of the largest in the US (very popular team in the 80's and 90's), and had a recent surge of fans due to recent success. That's A LOT of exposure for Spurs.",0,1382545537,null,0,false,0,ccxxots,t3_1p0p7s,t1_ccxxots,t1_ccxx5ru,null,1429013030,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

no it isn't, the pavement is at least 2 ft wide. Even if it *were* a blind corner, there are safe ways of turning out that involve entering traffic.

Thing with the NFL over here though, while it is growing - it's still very very early days.

I also don't think growth is going to be easy for the NFL as the average sports fan here just makes fun of it. I guess it's like how Soccer was in the States in the 1970s, so yeah - probably a bit early to try and win over fans to a specific team.

Consider how many different types of documents there are and how many different individual circumstances there are. Foreign students get different stamps in their passports depending on where they are from. EU tourists from different countries with different rules regarding re-paying the NHS. There are non-EU tourists who may or may not have health insurance or ability to pay. People here on spousal visas. People who are working here for a few months but aren't permanent resident. I think it would be a nightmare.

There are around 2000 hospitals in the UK, 7000 GP surgeries, and lots of other NHS facilities like walk in centres, mental health facilities etc. Do we expect them all to be able to identify an American person working here, but who isn't permanent resident in the UK, but who has health insurance vs an Italian woman who is visiting family as a tourist and may have to pay upfront and get reimbursed by the Italian government. It's far too much to expect front line staff to handle without distracting from other things. The whole NHS system has been constructed without the need or ability to check people before treatment.

&gt;I wonder how those people manage to get through life if they can't bring stuff they need to their non-medical appointments.

Many don't. But also the idea of taking documentation to an NHS facility is pretty alien to most people. Missed appointments are already a problem. And I'm sure more people use the NHS more regularly than opening bank accounts or other things that require documentation.

&gt;As I understand it the database is one of the few things that is working. Certainly I've had leaflets saying that my records are soon to be digitised and whether I would like to opt out. It wouldn't have been tremendously difficult to include an extra field to include this.

That database has taken over a decade and billions of £ to get here. I wouldn't say it was quick or easy. 

People abusing the NHS upsets me too, but this is really just a distraction. I just don't believe that the amount of money spent enforcing this would be worth it.

why? interviews are already recorded with some parts off record, crime is already recorded with some parts off record, what do you think is legally tricky about being allowed to turn off a camera if (and only if) that's the express wish of the person you are talking to, and that person is not under suspicion of a crime?

&gt;And the ones that are very light will be the worst performing and/or the most expensive.

GoPro is just one example of dozens of relatively cheap, durable, small mountable cameras  officers could wear. 

&gt;They'll also have bugger all battery life,

If the officer isn't capable of carrying round about 50gm in Li-Ion battery they're not fit to work in the police. Providing battery power for electronics is a very, very well explored field and as uses of power go, cameras are some of the least intensive there are. Look at infantry in warzones, who carry multiple battery systems for multiple shittily integrated pieces of kit and manage fine, compared to what's already out there this is nothing.

&gt;unremovable memory cards 

first off that's not even a real problem (unless you're suggesting these cameras are surgically implanted or something- the police don't wear their vests home, so there's no reason physical access to the camera wouldn't be available outside of their shift) and second of all, why would you *want* them able to tamper with the recording? it makes sense to explicitly order cameras that don't support plug and play or have removable memory, because you want to protect the information and you can't do that if anyone can just pop the card out and chuck it in a hedge

&gt; Secret? Actual, national security marked secret?

secret as in ""this is a picture of the victim's bank details"" secret. Confidentiality is nothing new. 

&gt;Now, private property. How would you define that? Rail stations are private, but they're also public. The courts are public buildings, but it's illegal to film in a sitting court.

You think these are new problems the police have never had to face before? You think nobody has ever called the police to a train station or asked them not to barge into a court in session?

the same rules apply as they always have. Treat the camera like a physical police officer- if the officer has no official business being in a place, the camera has no business recording that place. If the officer does have business being in a place, so does the camera. A national police force have been around for centuries and every obscure element of every state of property ownership has already been investigated by them.

&gt;article 8

section 2 reads:

&gt;&gt; There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right **except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of** national security, **public safety** or the economic well-being of the country, **for the prevention of disorder or crime**, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

so the cameras wouldn't infringe on any existing human rights law. Again, treat them like you treat the officer. If the officer is allowed to see something, the camera is allowed to see something. If the officer isn't allowed to go somewhere, neither is the camera. If someone asks the officer to not remember something, they turn the camera off as well. 





&gt;What happens when a camera stops working?

then you send it to [insert new forensics place] and they look at it to decide whether it failed due to tampering or not. Determining whether a camera is actually faulty would be the hard part considering nobody with access to it should see the footage at any point for at least a few days, but I'm optimistic there's a way of doing that (eg pull 10 frames from points at which you know the officer wasn't at a call because they're not logged at one, blur faces and text with an algorithm, show them to a person)

If the camera's faulty, no problem. If the officer's camera (which is their responsibility)  is tampered with, treat it like if the officer tampered with any other form of evidence.

* Try to avoid the Tube (the Underground Rail System) at Rush Hour (8:00-9:30 AM or 5:30-7:30 PM)

* When using the Tube, buy an Oyster Card, it makes the travel system much easier as you simply have to touch it and touch out of stations and keep the card topped up.

* If you are in [London Travel Zone 1](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211877723041400854750.0004deccd64385654a8be&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.511627,-0.126858&amp;spn=0.093694,0.154324) and need to get to another area, look up how long it would take to walk. Zone 1 is 5 miles wide and 3 miles long, but things are the station are very close and if it only 2 stops on the tube or a 3 with a change it would take that long to walk it. Most Londoners themselves do not do this and are surprised how easily connected various London landmarks are by walking.

Also if you come form New York (and I'm going to stereotype you now) you will be surprised by the rich history in places like London, Go see some Museums, what sort of things are you into? 

As for what there is to recommend, what are you into or not into?

B) By putting the United logo we are basically winning the bet for /r/RedDevils who were douchy as fuck when they won the bet because of Clattenburg. Even ignoring the bet with them, I don't want the United glory hunters to gain or win anything from this bet who are finally tasting what it feels like to lose.

C) There is a lot of Chelsea related material that will piss City fans off more than a United crest like something about the Terry - Bridge incident which City fans still get riled up about.


**So please don't do this. This is a horrible idea** and we gain nothing from this. 

**The misery of City fans for us is not worth the fact that we will be giving joy to the United fans**, in fact we might as well place nothing on their sub if we were to place a United crest because at least that way those fucks don't gain anything.

That being said, I believe guns no longer being legal will not create a society of defenceless victims because if people that want to buy guns to assault people cannot obtain them, then people will not need to defend themselves against them with other guns.


Now I know a common argument against this point is that ""criminals won't care if they break the law to obtain a gun""  but most people that buy guns are not criminals until they eventually ""snap"" or decide to use them on innocents later. And as for the other people that will buy a firearm with the intention of attacking people, they then have to pay far more, thus again lowering the amount of ""villains"" who would be able to buy guns further. 

You only have to look at gun crime in countries where they are illegal to see a drastic difference. Another common argument to this: ""But those countries have higher crime rates with knives and other weapons"" this is true, there will always be psychos and villains wanting to harm others, but if somebody walks into a shopping centre with a knife, they could possibly harm one or two people before being subdued, but if somebody walks into a shopping centre with a firearm, they can harm a much higher amount of people.

When this is something minor, like a copper lies about your actions in order to give you an £80 fixed penalty fine and punish you for being lippy, then it only destroys public trust in the police.

When it comes to a major crime, in which there is already evidence, but doubt remains, then a policeman lying can tip the balance and result in a major miscarriage of justice, with innocent men imprisoned for a decade.

Such police malfeasance has been discovered repeatedly in recent years. Undiscovered falsification of evidence doesn't bear thinking about, but it's quite likely there are innocent people in prison right now.

His inability to find space hold the ball up (the second most important job for a lone striker) against Schalke was actually a big problem for us, with the midfield struggling to find outlets. Occasionally he picks the ball up and takes a couple nice touches, maybe beating someone, but there is really never any end product, and most of the time he just gives it away. There is a tendency to judge strikers unfairly by their goal output, both positively and negatively. Just because he scored two goals (both of which you would really expect any professional striker to score) doesn't mean he played incredibly well, like a lot of pundits and fans are saying.

Overall, I would say his recent performances have been good but not great by any means. Granted that's a big improvement over where he was before, but I am still not even vaguely comfortable with the idea of him leading the line if we are trying to compete for real trophies (which of course, we are).

People talk about GBBO in their coffee breaks, on the internet, wherever. And yes most people I spoke to weren't huge fans of ruby, but it's a TV show - everyone talks about the characters in a popular show, some who they'll like some who they won't. Ruby wasn't popular as you've pointed out (though ultimately it was on the baking, not the popularity, that decided the competition!), Kimberly and Francis were both extremely popular however so the notion that the whole show is just a slagging match for the public, and the misogynstic comments were mainstream doesn't wash.

I think to Ruby's credit the editors of the show probably realised that with a bit of clever cutting they could make her seem far worse than she actually was, which was why week after week we got the predictable moping shot of Ruby's face followed by a self-disparaging comment which Paul and Mary were apparently quick to correct with praise. Maybe she *was* making a plea for praise every week, or maybe the editors wanted those ratings. We'll never know, but all said and done it's just a tv show and coffee break opinions don't mean anything.

However, the cynic in me thinks the reason she has a published article in the Guardian less than 24 hours after the show finished, is because she's a smart person and realises the potential of the Ruby Tandoh brand.

true,flyingfences,dalek,Dalek,"Banning firearms would not significantly hinder an interested party from acquiring them. Look at the war on drugs.

I can't find a statistic on what percentage of killings are premeditated. I will refute your point by saying that the large incidents that become big news stories tend to be people going crazy, but many firearm murderers tend to purchase arms for that purpose. I am in full support of requiring background checks (including violent criminal history and mental conditions) for purchasing guns. I do not believe that simply making guns illegal will take them out of circulation.

When it comes to comparing countries, you have to remember that laws are not all that dictates statistics, culture and history must also be taken into account. The USA is generally the scapegoat of these sorts of comparisons, while European nations are given as examples of safe places. Europe was a feudal land for centuries. Peasants, most of the population, were not allowed to have weapons in many cases. This tradition of preventing the people from arming themselves continued past the fall of feudalism into modern times. Europe has not had a culture of armed civilians. America, on the other hand, was settled by people very heavily armed. The local populations were conquered by force. There have been guns in America for as long as there has been ""western"" civilization in America.

In 2011 there were roughly 300 million guns in the USA, and 8500 gun deaths, meaning that 0.003% of guns are used for killing in the US. Most people don't arm themselves to harm others. They arm themselves to protect themselves. Nobody wants to be a victim of another. The famous Second Amendment exists not to defend citizens from citizens, but to defend citizens from government. The US had just fought a war against an oppressive government, and only won because the people were able to rise up, arm themselves, and fight. People like to arm themselves because it gives them a sense of security.

I found the people open and friendly, the food outstanding and it has to rate as one of the happiest times of my life, I was dragged into a kitchen after I asked how my meal was prepared an got to cook it all over again over a few beers. Although drugs where freely available I never saw anything other than grass.

Now I wouldn't dare do that same trip, the whole region that I travelled within is now a war zone thanks to the drug going north and the guns coming south, the gentleman that took me into his kitchen was killed a number of years ago for no apparent reason.

true,Lilday,England,[Red XJ6N],"I've only been riding for almost 2 years, but honestly this video just screams at me that you're gonna have a crash soon.

Everybody speeds, but in this video it seems like you were just doing it for the camera. Chill out. Also speed bumps...they're there for a reason. Maybe you think that road is safe to speed on but they are not good for your suspension if you keep slamming them.

This whole video looked dangerous to me, and I'm not exactly a perfect rider.

- When you were starting the bike...Hold the button a little longer and give it a little throttle. Spinning the starter once or twice sounded awful.

- 2:10 - horrible overtake. Seriously that car could have turned right without indicating or moved farther out to avoid the parked car. OK sure, if he didn't indicate it was his fault...but being correct won't make hospital food taste any better. You may not respect the driver of the car...that is fine, but respect the car. It is a 2 tonne metal box and it **will** kill you.

- Speedbumps throughout - You're hitting them too fast and too hard. I get it, you like speeding...but some of those were in 20mph zones and you're clearly nailing 45-50. It isn't safe, but it also isn't good for your suspension.

- Van door @ 2:52. You noticed it and moved out, but IMO you should have been nearer the white line anyway. This isn't a big deal.

- Overtaking the silver focus @ 3:10. Nope. That was just reckless. Unless you're headed to a hospital to a family member on their death bed...You don't need those extra 3 seconds that you saved.

- Corner @ 3:19...coasting around the corner isn't a great idea, you should be braking for the entrance and accelerating out. Here you just kidna rolled around with no drive to the rear wheel which (in the rain specifically) could cause the rear to lock if you so much as breathe on the rear brake pedal.

- Overtaking the moped wasn't a great idea. You're in a 20mph zone and there is a junction ahead. Not only that - there is a van coming from the junction, AND there is a speed bump right before the junction so your bike is way off balance for braking.

- Overtaking around 4:40. I'm not sure on the speed limit but you look a little fast. Take a look at my own video here to see what could happen:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRg7KZDhcus

- 5:58 between the vans. I can see you following the other biker and it isn't a big deal...but just remember that most white van drivers are assholes.

- Overtaking @ 8:25 was just pointless and dangerous.

- 9:02 was very sloppy and kind of a dick move overtaking the red bike (GPZ maybe?)

- yeah 9:15 on just seems like you're trying to race that GPZ

- Filtering pretty fast at 10:15. Pedestrians could pop out. Seen it happen.

- Did you check your blind spot at 10:27? **edit** yeah but not properly

- Mini @12:17 dodgyyyyyyyy

- 14:00 what the fuck dude chill out

A few times you jumped back on the throttle when the clutch was still engaged. Not such a big deal on a 125 but do that on an r1 and you'll be doing a backflip...steady on the clutch control.

meh, just chill out and be careful.

It may be a bit egotistical of him, but it's true.  He may be the single most important creature in the history of time, he is still the Timelord Victorious from the Tennant era.  That sense of accomplishment and importance still lives somewhere in his head, which is one of the reasons he hates himself a lot now.  But, at times, he has shown the willingness to use that importance to either intimidate or defeat his enemies.  I believe this was one of those times.  

And, I disagree about the show losing touch with the idea that everyone is important.  After all, Clara is just an ordinary girl who became important because of her choices.  Her story absolutely reflects the idea that travelling with The Doctor leads ordinary people to become extraordinary.

Congratulations, Unite. By failing to live in the real world and recognise the basics of economic hardship, you've destroyed the livelihoods of another 800+ people. They should count themselves lucky that there may be a glimmer of hope for the Refinery now that the petrochemical plant's lossmaking can be struck off the books, but it's a disgrace that they will probably try to blame this on anyone but themselves.

I'm sorry if I sound insensitive here - as someone whose family have worked in manufacturing for generations, I know it's always terrible when such large job losses occur. But the world is constantly changing, while Unions themselves seem hellbent on preventing any modernising that could help British businesses remain competitive. My stepfather for one despises them - his current factory has been able to modernise in spite of union pressure and they're now in the best financial state they have been for years, employing almost double the number of employees they once did. He for one loves working with the ""fancy japanese machine"" he's been supplied with at no small cost.

They prevented the shipbuilding industry from modernising and it collapsed against international competition.

They prevented the coal industry from modernising and it collapsed from lack of investment.

They prevented the car and rail manufacturing industries from modernising and they collapsed against more competitive foreign companies.

Finally, a quick question for Scottish users here: if the worst comes to the worst and Grangemouth closes entirely, do you think it could help the SNP's independence campaign?

true,flerd_trandle,null,null,"I had this discussion with myself ""out loud"" on my blog recently.  I am both Jewish and American, so I don't know if that makes my opinion less or more valuable in this discussion.

Yid isn't a bad word in the US.  The pejorative in the US is kike.  From my own experience I find comparing the word Yid to the n-word laughable.  Yid is a word Jews used to refer to Jews, not derogatorily.  It is something detractors later tried to co-opt as an insult, though I fail to see how calling me by my own nickname is an insult.  The n-word isn't a word stolen from black people, it was created to insult black people.

Do I think trying to take an insulting word and using it does anything at all to diffuse its power?  No.  Taking the n-word as an example, African-Americans have been trying to do this for years now, using the word in rap, in comedy, writing, vernacular usage, etc.  Can I say it?  Absolutely not.  So, if people who aren't black can't say the n-word, then all of these years of blacks using the word themselves has done absolutely nothing to diffuse its power.

Should then, based on comparison to usage of the n-word, only Jews be able to use the n-word?  Nope.  There is a large segment of the African-American population who are dead set against black people using the word themselves.  They still see it as an insult and as an example of self-loathing.   That's the way I hear it too.  It sounds like a lack of self-respect.  If you don't respect yourself, why should anyone else respect you?

The key question here is this: is the word Yid, in the wider world outside of the United States, a seriously offensive term on par with the n-word?  If it is, we all need to stop using it.  If not, and people are just making a mountain out of a mole hill, then Keep Calm and Yid On.",0,1382559021,null,0,false,0,ccy3ptu,t3_1p21r0,t1_ccy3ptu,t3_1p21r0,null,1429010218,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

But it's clear that from supermarkets to themed pub nights to children's parties, all the commercial activity revolves around Halloween now, with November 5th completely eclipsed.

Where I grew up - Sussex - there's still a very strong tradition of Guy Fawkes Night torchlit processions from rival bonfire societies, [most notably in Lewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes_Bonfire) with seven different societies taking over different areas of town. This is a notoriously riotous, spectacular event - they commonly burn the Pope and various political figures as well. It's amazing and raw and whenever I've been, I've felt glad to be alive. Apparently, as recently as a century ago, almost all of the UK had bonfire culture as rich and varied as this - but it's been diluted down, left behind, and forgotten throughout the 20th century, until we ended up with what passes for ""Bonfire night"" in most places today. I was shocked when I left Sussex to realise that it's of no significance elsewhere - there might be fireworks at local playing fields, but nothing else really.

This upsets me, Halloween hardly has the same traditions behind it. I honestly feel like after four hundred and fifty years of continual celebration of November 5th, it's now poised to fizzle out entirely within my lifetime.

You've misread that. There are three tests: (a) is it in accordance with the law?, (b) is it necessary in a democratic society and (c) does it fulfill one of the listed aims?

You can't just say ""well, prevention of crime was mentioned so therefore it's ok"". I submit that it's hard to say that filming a woman who's just been raped (she, likely, won't be asking you to turn your camera off) and storing that footage for a decade (or whatever) on government servers is unlikely to be necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime. 

If you exclude situations like that, you have to think very hard about the situations in which the police officers should turn their cameras off, about when those situations end, and about what events should cause a police officer to turn the camera on regardless. You then have to draft these rules, get lawyers to check them, make sure that the police are properly trained on the contents of this 300 page document, and then set up disciplinary procedures and punishments for police who fail to follow them, set up a committee to determine what footage should be erased from the database, and a tribunal to hear appeals from the decisions of that committee.",0,1382563171,null,0,false,0,ccy5kib,t3_1p1e3x,t1_ccy5kib,t1_ccxynky,null,1429009281,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It then gave notice of a 48-hour strike from Sunday to Tuesday. Management responded by shutting down the plant. There were talks last week at arbitration service Acas. They broke down, but the union withdrew its strike threat.

Ineos moved swiftly to require staff to accept changes to their contracts. The union urged members not to accept but to demand a return to negotiations. Two-thirds of Unite members took that advice, or half of the total workforce.

Ineos said on Wednesday morning that the union response led it to close the plant, much faster than it had previously indicated. Liquidators are to be appointed within a week.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_around_the_world

&gt; Cornish people observe Allantide on Halloween.

&gt; There are certain customs associated with All Saints' Day (All Hallows Day) and All Souls' Day. In the past, on All Souls' Eve families would stay up late, and little ""soul cakes"" were eaten.

&gt; The tradition of giving soul cakes that originated in Great Britain and Ireland was known as souling, often seen as the origin of modern trick or treating in North America, and souling continued in parts of England as late as the 1930s, with children going from door to door singing songs and saying prayers for the dead in return for cakes or money.

&gt; The name Halloween is first attested in the 16th century as a Scottish shortening of the fuller All-Hallows-Even, that is, the night before All Hallows Day.

Guy Fawkes was 1600s, and Halloween has pagan roots. So really you could argue that Guy Fawkes took over from Halloween.

&gt; At the time of mass transatlantic **Irish and Scottish immigration, which popularized Halloween in North America**, Halloween in Ireland and Scotland had a strong tradition of guising and pranks. Trick-or-treating may have come from the custom of going door-to-door collecting food for Samhain feasts, fuel for Samhain bonfires and/or offerings for the spirits and fairies. Alternatively, it may have come from the English All Saints/All Souls custom of collecting soul cakes.


&gt; North American almanacs of the late 18th and early 19th century give no indication that Halloween was celebrated there.[62] The Puritans of New England, for example, maintained strong opposition to Halloween,[62] and it was not until the mass Irish and Scottish immigration during the 19th century that it was brought to North America in earnest.",0,1382564767,null,0,1382567922,0,ccy69cm,t3_1p2m51,t1_ccy69cm,t3_1p2m51,null,1429008960,174,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,174

He was one of, if not *the* most successful pirates of the Golden Age of Piracy. A common Welshman accidentally brought into the life of piracy, he was one of the founders of the Pirate Lore they mention in Pirates of the Caribbean and is credited with being one of the first pirates to look down on rampant rape (pretty progressive for his time).

He always dressed flamboyantly before a battle so as to hide any blood that might dishearten the crew, and when he finally died his crew made sure he got a proper burial instead of trying to fight off the inevitable defeat by the British.

This Welsh Pirate in Assassins Creed may not be a direct reference to Barti Ddu, but I am sure as hell going to pretend he is Black Barti while I'm playing!

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"&gt; This upsets me, Halloween hardly has the same traditions behind it.

The origins of Halloween pre-date Guy Fawkes by more than 700 years.

&gt; The Roman Catholic holy day of All Saints (or All Hallows) was introduced in the year 609, but was originally celebrated on 13 May. 

&gt; In 835, Louis the Pious switched it to 1 November in the Carolingian Empire, at the behest of Pope Gregory IV. ... churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century. Thus, Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November. James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead (Samhain) 

""*Hardly the same traditions*""

It was important enough to MOVE a Christian holy day so they coincided.

And that's the just the Christian recognition of the festival that we now know as Halloween. The roots of Halloween go way back.

Given those circumstances most people are very tolerant and generous, there is a stigma of poverty attached to certain groups, especially black Africans and Roma, but most manage to survive and the migrant communities themselves function to give people a semblance of life when the State doesn't provide it. 

An example being an abandoned half-built apartment block just outside Milan that my friend's husband (who is a Moroccan man who spent his teen years in Italy) took me to. Dozens of immigrants, from all sorts of backgrounds who were technically homeless were living there and had made it in to a mini-shanty town, they had converted the basement in to a cinema and had communal kitchens set up, it wasn't luxurious by any means but it was just about liveable and I was told it was preferable to the ordeal of trying to claim benefits from the Italian State. 

Economically they were worse off than migrants here, who do get a lot more help, but given the scale of migration to Italy and the State of Italian national finances they were doing a lot better than might have been the case, it wasn't that they were being helped so much as they were not being hindered in setting up their own grey-market business etc.  ",0,1382566680,null,0,false,0,ccy720q,t3_1p2f97,t1_ccy720q,t1_ccy5l62,null,1429008588,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

a YBR with a few mod's one being renthal bars

a cbf125


I've found that my bike is the most comfortable and the gears actually feel like they're there. my experiences from riding those other bikes they just felt like toys and cheap. However because of the size and weight on my bike it definitely feels like a bigger machine and less of a hooligan toy which i think has also affected the way i've learnt to ride a motorcycle. The Varadero will happily sit at 60 all day long pushing the limit(72) it very noisey as its top gear and 11 thousand rpm. With a V-Twin engine the Vara is fairly torquey and has a, i guess you could say powerband between 6000+ revs. You won't be as fast as the much lighter single cylinder bikes but you will be the most comfortable and you will definitely have more road presence.

Edit:Forgot to add that the Vara is the big boy bike, So if you're a larger person you won't look like [this](http://workersbravo.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/homie-the-clown.gif)

If you make a successful investment you are taxed on the profit. If Bitcoin are an investment you treat the income as capital gains.

If the bitcoins are not treated as an investment then you pay tax on it as income, just as you would income tax.

That's my understanding of it. So if you put pounds into euros and the euro went up to 10x it's value you'd still have to pay tax on it, either as income or as a successful investment.

I cannot stress enough though that I'm not an accountant and the above could be erroneous or lacking in key details.

Your 20 euro example is a case where legally one should pay tax, but I think there are certain thresholds under which you are exempt from taxation that it would be well below. If you have the equivalent in Bitcoin you're probably not going to be taxable any more than anyone who sold anything on eBay making a few quid here and there...

Rome tried to Christianise it just like they did with christmas and easter festivals by having an 'All Souls Day' or 'All Hallows Day', the day before thus becoming All Hallows' Evening which was shortened to Halloween. 

Its original name in Gaelic (Irish or Scotish as they are virtually the same language) was Samhain, pronounced sow-in (sow as in the pig). The church probably tried to shake the customs involved such as the bone-fire (originally made from cattle bones) and the dressing up to ward of evil but found it difficult because they obviously remain.


For reasons which largely seem to be unknown, Halloween lost favour in large parts of Britain but not Ireland. This might have something do to with the rise of protestantism or perhaps arrival of the Angles and Saxons. We do know it seems to have been replaced in some parts of the island with a night celebrating the execution of a failed Catholic terrorist. Ardent Unionists in Northern Ireland for example refuse to celebrate Halloween and regard it as a Catholic festival. The Catholics meanwhile hold one of the largest Halloween parties in the UK in Derry, sort of like a second Paddy's day.

true,Liadan,eng-Eastanglia,East Anglia,"Yeeah... the UK's choice to make it difficult for non-Brits to marry British citizens there is exactly why I got married in my non-British husband's country instead. It's actually easy to do so, where he lives, and there's only the initial problem of getting into the country. 

None of my family could be there. It meant my dad couldn't walk me down the aisle — not that we had an aisle; we had our ceremony on top of a nearby mountain. 

When I was researching the process for a UK wedding, the hurdles involved getting a fiancé(e) visa (not guaranteed), getting into the country (not guaranteed), and having to stay in the country for weeks on end in order to give notice and meet residency requirements. That last bit means that people wanting to get married in the UK, to their British partners, have to be able to absorb the cost of living somewhere unfamiliar while being unable to work for at least a month, on top of paying for a wedding, flights and so on.

Maybe that's not entirely unreasonable, but if they're extending that time, it's going to make it a lot harder for couples to marry, even when it's accepted that the vast majority of marriages are real. It's already too much for some genuine couples. I just can't help thinking that there has to be a better way to test a couple's relationship.

...Though... is a marriage, by itself, enough to confer residency in the UK? From what I've seen of the immigration process for my husband's country, it seems that it requires evidence and witnesses and interviews and so on; does the UK really have nothing similar? I'd certainly prefer a system where a marriage is relatively easy but importing a spouse requires more checking.",0,1382572384,null,0,false,0,ccy9b6v,t3_1oyx26,t1_ccy9b6v,t3_1oyx26,null,1429007536,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But he'd also make a world class midfielder. he has all the attributes. the vision, the composure, and the technique.

When you can hold on to the ball as well as he can, you are pretty much good anywhere in front of the backline.

Interestingly this is one of those technologies that the commissioner is very interested in. However like all things of its ilk when it comes to public sector matters it'll end up being very costly. 

I can see there being uses for shutting it off. Some victims/witnesses may not be comfortable with it. When entering a person's house if they don't want it on then well they have every right to ask that it be switched off really, I do need to go to the toilet at some point (see am human after all). Also from the point of view that a medium sized borough might have 50 to 80 officers on at any one time (perhaps more) that's a lot of footage over 1900 hours worth a day. Multiply that up by 32 and that's a lot of footage just for the Met police district. We are getting BWV (body worn video) now. In the main its a very good tool. We can currently select whether or not we want it to record.

 The good thing is that it makes the whole process much more manageable. The officer with the camera turns the unit on, records, and then turns it off again as required. When they want footage they can use a dedicated computer to burn a DVD. Once that's done they just exhibit it and its sorted so its fairly simple. There's no need to go wading through footage, there's no huge issues with back end storage. There is fairly minimal faffing around.

true,ksturgis,null,null,"&gt;Just because he scored two goals (both of which you would really expect any professional striker to score) doesn't mean he played incredibly well

Sort of. A big part of what makes a striker's job difficult is knowing where to be at the right moment to score those *easy* goals. His first goal I thought showed great awareness and instincts. He recognizes that the defense wasn't paying attention to him and moves in behind and on the back post so that once the ball squeaks through he can poke it in. Often times an out of form player will be caught ball watching, not reacting. 

As for his second goal, he actually still had plenty to do once he received the ball. Players are under tremendous pressure once they receive the ball with only the keeper to beat and a defender bearing down on them. He moved cooly beyond the keeper and quickly dispatched before the defender could intervene. I realize you would expect many forwards to accomplish this, but the fact remains that we constantly say we need forwards who can finish the chances afforded to them and that's what he did. Just bc he's not scoring brilliant goals doesn't mean he's not an in-form forward. He could score 30 tap-in goals and would still be considered one of the top forwards in Europe.

To give you an idea of the size of this place, the UK could fit about 15 times inside México (Mx- 1,972,550 km2, UK-130, 422 km2) Just the state that I live in, Chihuahua, is roughly the size of spain.

We have deserts in the north, that turn into forests, that turn into tropical forest, then to jungles, with jaguars and chupacabras.

The capital, as well as the major cities, Juárez, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Sonora, etc. are very cosmopolitan, urban, up to date modern cities. But there is a huge contrast with the rural México, which, from the size of it, is pretty big, and there you will find, most of the stereotypes.

There is a lot of corruption, the drug trade is fierce, but it was decent and proper (I say it like this because as long as there are illegal drugs, and users, there will be providers, but it can be handled in a civil manner, like it was for decades) until a power struggle emerged, that struggle is over in most of the country, and things are returning to normal, and in a few years drugs like marijuana will become legal, and things will, well I don´t know what will happen, but it will be good.

The sheer distance between states and cities create a myriad of cultures, just in the north, the closest big city from Juárez (where I live) is the states capital, Chihuahua, and it is 3 and a half hours away by car, you get there and the culture is very different, so from the north to the middle to the south, its like 3 different countries, all held together by the national football team and the Guadalupe Virgin.

A simple way to view México, culture wise, as a geographical state would be, the north is like Manchester, the center is like London, and the south is like Northern Ireland, they have their own things going on, we could do with out them, and they don´t really care about us that much, but hey they have great beer so lets keep them in the republic.

And why was you bank negative at that point? Because you'd spent money you didn't yet have - for whatever reason, you are the only one who could have held those payments.

&gt; I'm interested in hearing how you would have dealt with this situation

The second you feel you are likely to go overdrawn, contact the bank and let them know and ask for an approved overdraft. This will always cost you less than an unapproved overdraft, because they won't be sending you reminder letters every 3 days at 30 quid a pop.

You could also contact the people you were owing money to e.g. electric, gas companies, mobile phone contracts or whatever, advise them of the situation and let them know you couldn't pay your bills. I'm pretty sure essential services can't be cut anyway, and the other bills they'll for sure give you some time.

What I wouldn't do however is bury my head in the sand, pay out money I didn't have, go overdrawn without telling anybody, and them blame the bank for ""allowing you"", when you're the one in control of your account.",0,1382581019,null,0,false,0,ccycvm9,t3_1p31tn,t1_ccycvm9,t1_ccycom4,null,1429005872,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The department is very small, which means satisfaction is generally fairly high, and we all tend to know the lecturers and professors by their first names. Tutorial sizes in the first couple of years were around ~5 people, so seemed fine.

It is a very coursework intensive course. You will know how to program by the end of it, and if you take the right modules, preferably in a number of languages. Java and C, obviously, but second year has a Haskell and Python group project module. 

The coursework is laid on fast and hard through the subhonours (first two) years, and you're expected to hand in a programming practical each week, sometimes two. The upshot is that you *really* know how to code fairly quickly, in a way my peers at other universities don't seem to. In honours it dies down a bit, with fewer deadlines and harder practicals.

-It's warmer. No standing around in the mud waiting for things to go bang.

-You're less likely to be injured by a firework

-You can dress up in awesome costumes.

-Your kids can dress up (if you have them) rather than waving around flaming wands of burning (while these are of course awesome, so is trick or treating and it's kind of sad when they pick up the wrong end of the sparkler).

-Halloween happens indoors and involves alcohol. Guy Fawkes happens outside and involves trying to clutch a hot dog in one hand and a hot chocolate in the other and figuring out how to consume both without getting ketchup on your scarf.

-Halloween costumes reveal more boob than winter coats.

-Trick or treating gives me a chance to fill other people's children up with sugar. It also gives me an opportunity to buy my god-daughter a bee costume.

-Pumpkin carving. 

-Halloween is less scary for pets

true,benlovell,null,null,"(CS) Tough as fuck, you'll be given deadlines in the first two years at a rate of one practical a week until it goes up to two, then you'll be expected to choose your own CS modules and actually have hard modules. 

The benefits of this is that you learn a lot of programming. From this course alone I have learned: Java, C (though I knew some already, writing a malloc and a few system libraries helps tremendously), JavaScript (properly), Python, Haskell (not as much as Edinburgh), and PHP (ugh). When the language requirements lax a bit you can do things in anything you want, pretty much, so I've taught myself Go for a practical (seems nice enough) and am now doing the same with Clojure (lisp isn't well taught here). 

One exception to this is Video Games, which requires you do it in Processing. One of the people behind this incredibly bizarre decision is below — tnhh. It is one of the major reasons I did not take that module. I'm sure he'll have something to say on this ;).

Core CS stuff is of course taught (data structures and algorithms), but a lot of the time the mathematical stuff can be glossed over until honours, where you're suddenly confronted with it, a little. Do some maths side modules in subhonours and you should be fine.

The big difference in this CS department from others (apart from the heavy coding requirement — a previous head of school did liken the course to Sparta) is the small size of it. I can't think of anyone, lecturer or professor, that we don't refer to on a first name basis. My class size is just under 30, iirc, and only about 10 people turn up to each lecture (everyone's doing different modules, and there won't be much more than that amount enrolled on a module). Most lecturers are happy for questions to be asked, and the teaching tends to be very high quality.

They got a lot of shit for a module called ""RPIC"": Research and Professional Issues in Computing, a compulsory third year module that was supposed to teach essential life skills to CS students — essays, public speaking etc. This was done incredibly badly, and made everyone very unhappy (inconsistent marking, ridiculous amounts of pointless coursework, general disorganisation). 

This was a large part of the reason in a drop in student satisfaction recently, which is why St Andrews dropped in the CS rankings for the Guardian (who heavily weight student satisfaction surveys). This has now been axed, so there's a bit of a void there, but I think it can be filled with extra-curriculars and subhonours modules (the debating society is free and very good, and you can do English/Philosophy in the first two years if you wish).

So yeah. Anything else, I would ask questions on [the Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/stacompsci) as Tristan said.

While he obviously has extensive experience, he is renowned as pro market and opening up NHS services to competition (plus, his involvement in the Foundation Trust policy, which is - in my opinion - root of many of the current NHS issues). Indeed, that whole movement started getting a lot of traction while he was Health Advisor to Labour. Personally, I'd have much rather seen an established clinician in post - one of the many well regarded Medical Directors or Chief Nurses we have in the NHS already.

Having said that, more than at any time in the past, his job will be limited. Chief Executive of NHS England is not the job it used to be - while the organisation has oversight of Hospitals, Mental Health Trusts and many other services, it is not directly responsible for them. That belongs to CCGs, which are 'assured' by NHS England, but again, they are their own organisations.

Public Health has been transferred out to Public Health England and the Local Authorities, so he doesn't have that in his portfolio. Ditto on education - Health Education England has control of workforce strategy and training.

So, what does the Chief Exec do? Well - he has direct responsibility for primary care, so GPs, Dentists and Opticians. Also specialised services - so burn units, uncommon cancers etc - and some of the more marginal services like armed forces and offender health. He also gets to set the strategic direction for the organisation as a whole, but much reduced powers to ensure anything he wants actually happens.

Regarding communism, you do relies that one of the main failures of supposed  communism in the state system was the centralised state managed capitalism? It wasn't communism nor socialism. It demanded people to work for the state pocket rather then for them selfs or humanity. They removed the private aspects of personal wealth gain. This is one of the reasons people are not particularly fond of Lenin, because he removed democracy from the workplace and removed power from peoples lives.

Long hours do not give anyone status, it's an abuse of mismanagement and capitalism. Under an egalitarian society, you shouldn't have to work your self to death.

Over here when a crazy man killed school children we got rid of guns, in America people though the solution was to make “child friendly” bullet proof backpacks and to give teachers guns.

I don't think any result (beyond a 5 goal drubbing either way) would surprise me with this one. I would be sorely tempted to switch up our formation to throw something unfamiliar at them. AJ and Phillips have both had stories on the offish proclaiming themselves to be fully fit, so I would be happy to see a two striker set up for the first time in a while. Give Hoillett another chance to move the ball up the pitch at speed and have the combo of AJ and Austin to work to get on the end. Close out the game with five in the middle if we need to shield a lead - which I'd judge a more legitimate tactic at Burnley than at Millwall. While our effectiveness at keeping other teams from scoring is pretty well known in the division, Burnley are second best, having conceded only 7 goals.

The only reason money has the illusion that its the only legitimate means, is because we've been indoctrinated by a capitalist society, it starts in school with the ""Competition -&gt; Reward"".  Competition isn't bad per-se, but then feeling you MUST have some capital gain is a complete illusion. Surely if you want to do something, you do it for your self and that makes you most happy?
