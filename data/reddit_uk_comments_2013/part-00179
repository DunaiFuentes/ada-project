Start off by driving the car forwards and backwards, it may well unseize all by itself. If it does you'll hear a bang.

If this doesn't work you could try jacking up that corner of the car, removing the wheel and giving the drum a few good clouts in different directions with a heavy hammer. Make sure the car is well supported so you don't knock it off the jack.

Think about it like this (hypothetically since i pulled this out of a hat)....You are living in Nottingham working in a call centre for someone like Tesco, you get a phone call from Virgin mobile who are impressed with your CV and the referrals that they have gotten about you from colleagues so they tell you that they want you to come to Virgin to be in charge of their call centre....you will get 3 times your wage, more holiday and they will pay for your relocation to Guildford.  Sounds a pretty good deal, a promotion, more money, better benefits and relocation to a nicer part of the country so you accept it and give notice.....its very unlikely that Tesco could say anything about it, and if they did you would still have the ability to quit and take the other job.  

Bale doesn't have that luxury, if he quits he still effectively belongs to Spurs it just costs him a truckload of cash.  So he is trying to force his way to what he views as a better situation for himself.

Now i think its disappointing he is doing this, he had been handling this extremely well and if he kept his mouth shut and let everything run its course he would still be getting his move, but i don't doubt that he is frustrated and is getting a constant stream of people telling him that this is a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" and how amazing this will be for him and his young family.

One is theft, a fairly universally bad thing. The other is a recreational drug, with no more or less negative side effects than alcohol consumption.

I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here, and I do appreciate where you are coming from.

The sad thing is this ham-fisted use of the medicinal argument exists because our government is willfully ignorant of the facts that surround this drug.

I honestly think without the medicinal argument weed would never be made legal (at least in the U.K). Once it's fairly commonplace treating the myriad of illnesses it can make a difference to, the public (and the government) will have no choice but to accept it is harmless. Legalization will swiftly follow.

So sadly, the mashed-up hippy saying ""Yeah man, they could use it to....like....treat glaucoma or something."" Whilst choking down a vast bowl is a necessary, although admittedly frustrating, evil.

There's not really any country in the world you can move to easily as a foreigner unless there's a prior agreement in place (such as with the EU countries) or if you have a job which is in big demand. 

In the UK we have an extra layer of difficulty because we have all 507 million European Union Citizens to call from before non-EU people are in demand. 

**If it's still helpful here is the general rules of immigration for the UK, copied from an earlier similar question:**

The jobs market in the UK is saturated - especially for young professionals. 

Most positions have hundreds of graduate applicants and even landing an interview is hellish. I've got a fairly good looking CV (resume) and it's still taken me over 4 months to land a promising interview. On top of that unless you can prove that you're eligible to live and work in the UK not many people will consider you. 

To put it in perspective, [a lot of British people are moving out of the UK for better job prospects.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10258081/Two-million-quit-Britain-in-talent-drain.html)

I don't say all of this to put you off - I just want to make sure that you have all the facts first. 

Details on how to get a visa:

1. A tourist visa that anyone gets when they visit allows for a 6 month stay **without working**. Be warned that you may be required to prove to a government official that you have enough money to meet your expenses for the duration of your stay (if you don't, the UK Border Agency has the right to put you on the next plane back to where you came from). You may also be required to show your return ticket. The longer your planned stay the more likely they'll question you about this.


2. To work for a U.K. company you'll need a work visa, but in order to obtain that, your employer must apply for you before you come to the U.K. If you plan to work for a British company, find your job before you leave.
3. The U.K. residency permit and visa system now operates on a points-system. The Tier 1 route is now only open to Entrepreneurs, Investors, Exceptional Talent and Graduate Entrepreneurs. Tier 2 is main route for work visas which must be sponsored by a U.K. employer. Tier 2 (General) permit providing they can demonstrate your job cannot be filled by a local worker. If you are transferring with your existing employer you can get a Tier 2 (ICT - inter company transfer) visa, otherwise the Tier 2 (General) permit requires a Certificate of Sponsorship (COS) from a U.K. employer who may be required to prove to the Border Agency that the job couldn't be filled by a British subject.

As for citizenship; that comes much, much further down the line:
&gt;The 'naturalisation' process:

You must have: 

1. lived in the UK for at least 5 years before the date of your application (unless your spouse or civil partner is a British citizen)

2. spent no more than 450 days outside the UK during those 5 years

3. spent no more than 90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months

4. been granted indefinite leave to stay in the UK, ie there’s no specific date that you have to leave

5. had indefinite leave to stay in the UK for the last 12 months (unless your spouse or civil partner is a British citizen)

6. not broken any immigration laws while in the UK

Also worth mentioning that marrying an individual specifically for the purpose of gaining citizenship will leave you in jail ;) 

tl:dr: The easiest way into the UK would be to find a job in the USA, but then ask for an inter-company transfer to a UK office. OR do your degree here.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; But i'm not seeing a good reason for the equivocation of stealing bikes and smoking weed.

Because BOTH are currently illegal, but *could* benefit certain groups of the community if they were made legal. The equivocation is there because the two things *are* equivalent.

&gt;  The other is a recreational drug, with no more or less negative side effects than alcohol consumption.

Do you know how many people die from alcohol or tobacco related illnesses every year ? I'm not claiming that weed is in anywhere the same league as either of these, but there *will* be some additional negatives.

Legalization is not just as simple as declaring one day, ""sure go ahead and smoke weed, it's cool"". Because people who ordinarily smoke at home will suddenly be smoking on the streets, in cars, exposing people to all the same risks as we've tried to limit and mitigate over the years such as passive smoking, drunk driving etc.

To claim otherwise is simply naive.

&gt; I honestly think without the medicinal argument weed would never be made legal (at least in the U.K).

Yes, but surely that is the wrong tack ? While benefits DO exist for many sick people, where does that leave all the perfectly healthy people who want to smoke ? The case has to be stated based on scientific studies of the pros and cons of weed, not just from a medical point of view, but from taxation, regulation, quality control - to avoid the stonethrowing and general ""told you so"" bullshit that is bound to occur.

&gt; So sadly, the mashed-up hippy saying ""Yeah man, they could use it to....like....treat glaucoma or something."" Whilst choking down a vast bowl is a necessary, although admittedly frustrating, evil.

I'm actually in favor of some sort of intervention at this point because I honestly feel that Assad is simply murdering his citizens now in an attempt to quell dissent. That's working on the assumption that Assad is gassing dissident areas though and I'm prepared to change my mind if the UN chemical weapons inspection team says differently.

Having said that, intervention without UN support makes little sense to me. The support isn't necessary in a strategic sense but when UN peacekeepers are involved the exit strategies seem to be a thousand times more effective than what the ""coalition of the willing"" seem to be able to provide. 

I think the case for support intervening in Syria is stronger but I do remember the scale of the lies people were prepared to tell to start the Iraq war. If this is a case of evidence being fabricated, I'm sure we'll never know about it till it's too late anyway and the one thing that makes me think this might be the case more than anything else is the current rush to intervene.",0,1377694412,null,0,1377697226,0,cbwxr51,t3_1l8zhq,t1_cbwxr51,t3_1l8zhq,null,1429672491,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Most of the students were British, but there were a few from other countries whose parents had moved to the area.

When I was there the teachers were academically excellent and very reasonable as human beings - going by the league tables, teaching is still excellent. Most classes were about 20 students, though some classes were smaller - Philosophy, and the advanced mathematics group, were about 10 people. I suspect these days 25 is an average class size.

The people going there are students, not pupils - you can wear pretty much what you want, and you are trusted enough that you can go into town whenever you feel like it. Similarly, if you're not working hard, they won't force you - it's your life.

My italics. Page 3 has an obvious functional role - 'you are a builder/painter and decorator/warehouse worker/squaddie and here is your daily sex picture'.

Page 3 isn't quite the same as Lad's Mags, though, right?

Capitalism works in a way that there will never be a win-win scenario. Someone has to earn less so that other person earns more. Just because an immigrant (or Brit who is paid not enough) picks up vegetables for NMW means you don't have to pay for them more. You can't suddenly increase everybody's wages as there will be no money to pay for it... unless you increase costs which then would go back to the same scenario that you don't earn enough because everything is so expensive. It's like with government debt, you can't simply print more money and pay itself for it.

The main point is keeping it all well balanced. Let people earn enough to make a fair living but not too much if they don't try harder. Nobody is forced to work on a farm but you either need to do such work to earn anything or get qualified and try to go up on the ladder with your career.

And seriously speaking, NMW is not much but it's a good start for any person who is willing to work and doesn't live in London (which is expensive to live in). You won't be driving a Bentley but even on NMW you won't be homeless and will be able to afford food, clothing and other basic requirements things.

I've made a few posts here which all have the same basic theme; [here is my most recent one](http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1ksvqt/need_help_with_inheritance/cbsar24)

Basically the plan should be - 

1. Remove debts that cost you money. Even if they dont, you should remove them as soon as they do.

2. Pension - You should start this is early as possible because compound interest. £50 a month now is the same as if you put in £100 ten years from now. 
Given your finances listed you probably cant put much in, but you might find your employer might match your contributions. MoneySavingExpert recommends half your age as a % - which assuming you are 21 which is probably more than you can afford, so i'd aim to put £50 a month in and increase it once you can afford that. this will vary depending on your work pension scheme - mine costs me £21 a month to have &gt; 200 a month go to my pension.

3. Savings. 
A regular savings account would be a good bet , but see the below section first. I actually wouldn't recommend an ISA till next april, when we are likely to see rates about 3% again.

4. current accts - bear in mind that Santander are rated worst bank for customer service (although, they seem to be improving) and their cashback has a maximum limit . [according to MSE, you'll typically only make £50 a year profit](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts#santander) - so perhaps you'd be better switching to First Direct for £125 , or the halifax one which is £100 and then £5 a month - both are rated higher in customer service, and being with first direct would let you access their 6% regular saver. The actual rate for comparison to a normal savings acct is around 3.2% , but that's still better than an isa or a normal savings acct will give, and marginally better than Santander. 

However if you dont go first direct for that regular savings acct, the next best is like 2.something percent, which you can get better with an ISA - so in that case do that.

Some things to bear in mind

* most regular savings accounts are locked - you cant access them for 12 months, and you cant really miss a payment. This might make them unsuitable for your situation and so an isa you can access could be better. 
* credit cards effectively give you 'free' lending for 30 days - so you could use a 30 day notice isa or savings account.

This is the saddest bit of it all for me.  Bale could stay where he's loved, where he's all but guaranteed to earn qualification to the Champion's League in another year, where he can become a player for the ages.  Instead he's headed to Madrid, which is never going to show him the kind of affection we will, and is never going to give him the same kind of playing time we will.

The way I see it, Spurs are an 8.  Bale's a 9 or 10 - to us, certainly, he's a 9 or 10, and we'd treat him like one.  But Bale's decided he deserves a 10 of his own, and that's Madrid.  She's one of those 10s who's a right bitch, and who'll treat Bale like shit no matter how hot he is.  He could stick with us, we'd treat him right.  But he's gotten cocky.

now you have brought up an interesting point, if the price of food went up, people would be unhappy, except, and heres where I win, they will be getting paid enough to afford the damn food and more, and then theres the issue the the farmer could lose some of their profits they do make money you know.

this is the typical thinking of people who secretly worry that their middle management job doesnt actually help anyone, you wont entertain the idea that economics can work in a different and better way if it is administered correctly, theres so many people along the chain making more money than they deserve while the hard working people doing all of the actual work are getting peanuts because the high paid people at the top set rules regulations and laws to ensure that their money and wages are protected, if everyone else took a sizeaple dip to their renumeration they would still be getting more money than they need but workers would also be getting enough.

&gt;Why do you think UK has fairly cheap clothing and plenty of other goods? It's only because it imports it from countries where labour is cheap. If you even want to import food from China then good luck, btw destroying most of UK farmers.

interesting, most of the home-grown expensive ""designer"" clothing is made for lower actul labour costs than cheap labour because it requires no staff and can be machinated, the reason it costs more is that the designers and dealers of these brands make a thick wedge of profit, certainly more profit per item produced than say primark

what you fail to understand is that it's not labour costs that drive prices but business' need to make ever increasing profits, if you took half of what is taken home as after tax profits by all of the large companies and mega rich entrepreneurs you could pay everyone a decent living wage.

But no. We waited. We decided to give peace and diplomacy a chance. There wasn't an appetite for intervention.

This should just reinforce one major thing that a lot of opponents of intervention don't seem to get: blowback also happens if you don't do anything at all.

Both suffered a similar time at Chelsea, namely being played infrequently and/or out of position. Sturrdige was often played out on the wing, and Torres spends most weekends in a comfy Recaro seat in the Chelsea dugout.

At Liverpool Torres and Sturridge are the main men. Both were/are played regularly week in and week out. Players, and strikers especially, benefit hugely from extended runs with a team, so it's possible to chalk some of that up to how they were used in their teams.

This also speaks to the philosophy of the two teams. Chelsea tend to go with what works and if it that level drops, immediately change something (or buy someone who is working at the time.) Liverpool, while not immune from impulse and panic buying, tend to give players a little more time to come good, even when they're not performing, see Henderson, Enrique and even Downing (although we ended up selling him)

There's no way Levy will sell Bale to another English team. Bayern won't put up 100 million for a single player. That only really leaves Real and Barcelona.

It is difficult to turn down a club like Madrid. Champs league every year, title challengers very year. Able to go after the worlds very best players, EVERY YEAR. And then there's us. I love Spurs with all my heart, but we haven't challenged for anything other that 4th spot consistently for years. Not even Europa league when we've qualified.

""Hello,


First of all I'm sorry to write you in English but I don't speak Spanish. I just read your e-mail regarding my apartment located in : 36 Calle Isabel La Católica, Prados Providencia, Guadalajara 44670, Jalisco.
The apartment is still available, with: 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1 kitchen and 1 living room (80 m2 ). The apartment is in the best conditions, furnished and have all the equipment that you will need including TV and washing machine. I can rent you the apt. for unlimited time. I really want to find a good and responsible tenant and I was hoping if you can send me some personal information's about yourself.
The rent price is 5650 MXN p/m including all utilities for as long as you need and the deposit is also 5650 MXN . The deposit will be returned as soon as you will decide to leave from the apartment (you will have to give me at least 30 days notice). The pets are OK with me. I bought this apartment for my daughter during her studies in Mexico, but now she's back home in United Kingdom permanently, so I'm renting the place for unlimited time and I left the keys and contract of the apartment, already signed by me, at a company called Plazza RealEstates.
If you want to find more about how this transaction can work please get back to me anytime and I will send you more information step by step.
Here are some pictures of my apt, please click on the link or copy it and paste it in your browser:

because let's face it NMW is not enough to live off. 

&gt;why do you think government doesn't rise the NMW significantly? whatever party is in the government).

it would directlyhurt their business and political interests? compared to personal profit who cares about fairness.

&gt;Capitalism works in a way that there will never be a win-win scenario.

capitalism works only for the controlling minority, at least in it's current form people at the top earn far too much and people at the bottom far too little, I'm not saying it should be all equal but the gap is too wide and for society's continued functionality in the long term this issue needs to be addressed. you make a huge huge assumption that those earning more deserve it, and an even bigger one that they have to be paid that much for capitalism to work

&gt;You can't suddenly increase everybody's wages as there will be no money to pay for it

yes there is decrease the wages of people earning 5 times that

&gt;The main point is keeping it all well balanced.

agreed, i'm just saying that we are far from balanced as the scale is weighted towards making the rich richer and the poor poorer. I dont have a problem with people having to do manual labour, but I know for a fact that it is bloody hard work and for that reason I think it deserves a better reward.


 &gt;And seriously speaking, NMW is not much but it's a good start for any person who is willing to work

except that it isnt, you make more money claiming benefits than working. that suggests it to be too low,  as for what you can afford on NMW that depends if you are paying for yourself or your family as well.

&gt;If teenagers expect to do nothing and earn so much money to drive new BMW then it's certainly a problem within a part of society, not with the system.

and this is where you hit a nerve. the low paid work is not nothing. it is everything. take away the workers and society stops dead, take away the management and it will most likely continue as normal.

manual labour is **HARD WORK** management is easy. by amount of exertion and hard work manual labour is the more intensive, which is why it makes no sense for it to be so low paid.",0,1377698965,null,0,false,0,cbwyxhd,t3_1l9001,t1_cbwyxhd,t1_cbwyh1i,null,1429671946,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Now don't get me wrong - some guys may well like that, but it's a risky move at best, and telling impressionable women to do it *without asking first* is basically advocating rape (non-consensual penetration of the vagina or anus with an object or extremity?  Check).

true,muertecaza,flair3,,"Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend have both started for Spurs on the right of AVB’s 4-3-3 this season, but is one more suited than the other?

Aaron Lennon

Aaron Lennon is more of a traditional winger than a wide forward. He likes to receive the ball to feet, then quickly go through the gears as he attempts to take the opposing full back on before crossing.

He’s had to adapt his style since the arrival of Andre Villas-Boas. With the Portuguese coach wanting our wide players to receive possession on the run, Lennon had to change up his game last season.

The England international got the start in our trip to Crystal Palace and with him in the side, we can see the width he brings to the position. The ball is moved out from the middle of the park to Aaron playing close to the touchline. He takes a lot of possession midway inside the Palace half, but he also receives passes played in-behind the opposing full back.

From here, he can dribble and either cross or pull the ball back. He set up a chance for Roberto Soldado, but also had four others blocked, indicated by the red lines inside the penalty area.

Another thing of note that we saw was that he also recycles possession well. He was trying to get in-behind to pick out crosses from shorter distances, but when the option is not on, he can play the ball backwards to Kyle Walker. Of Lennon’s 47 passes in the match, only 11 were forward and 7 square as the other 29 went backwards to a team mate.

This was further highlighted in his relationship with Kyle Walker. Lennon’s passes usually go back up the line to Kyle, who can pick the passes forward to Aaron.

Whilst Aaron Lennon brings width and dribbling to the position, he is not a shooter. He took only 29 shots in 34 appearances in the Premier League last season.

Andros Townsend

Whilst Aaron Lennon operates like a traditional winger, Andros Townsend plays the role as an inverted wide forward.

He plays with less width than Aaron and being a natural left footer, looks to come inside a lot more often. If we look at where he received the ball against Swansea, we can see that Townsend spends a lot of time in the inside right channel, whereas Lennon is more out towards the touchline.

Against Tbilisi, Andros was able to get in-behind the full back through dribbling at pace. Against Swansea, as he didn’t receive the ball played in deep, he dribbled infield and therefore his passes in to the box come through the inside right channel. This is more typical of the inverted wide forward than the traditional winger.

As a result of this movement, his relationship with Kyle Walker is different. Playing with Lennon, Kyle doesn’t overlap as much, as he doesn’t need to with the space being filled by Aaron. As a result, most of Walker’s passes are up the line.

Playing with Andros Townsend, Kyle has to provide the outlet as Andros cuts inside. Walker’s passes are short and often infield to Andros. The ones Walker receives are often played deep towards the by line and in-behind the full back.

What Andros Townsend cutting inside does give Spurs is another shooter.

He took 37 strikes at goal in his 17 appearances whilst on loan last season for QPR. He had four by cutting inside and firing diagonally across the goal against Swansea.

Who’s right, Aaron Lennon or Andros Townsend?

The right player really depends on whether we want a winger to fill the position to give added creativity or if we are looking to have another goalscorer.

This could really depend on who plays in the advanced midfield role. With a player that can pass in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Aaron Lennon was the choice. With a more powerful ball winner in Paulinho, Andros Townsend was the selection.

In Andre Villas-Boas’ previous managerial appointments, he has combined a winger with a wide forward. This could hint that a wide man like Aaron Lennon would play opposite a forward like Nacer Chadli.

However, this term we’ve seen our Portuguese coach look to move to a strong, powerful midfield trio that focuses on winning the ball back, then shifting it to the wide players. In this case, the wide forwards need to provide a goal scoring threat, which would favour a player like Andros Townsend.

With AVB playing his more preferred system of 4-3-3 this term, the incumbent of the right-sided role may just depend on the make-up of the midfield trio.",0,1377700072,null,0,false,0,cbwz9mj,t3_1l983f,t1_cbwz9mj,t1_cbwyrcb,null,1429671785,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

I'll bet you earn more than a sweatshop worker and enjoy better conditions - are you wet behind the ears because you wouldn't choose that environment? 

There are a limits on the conditions of work that someone would ideally choose for themselves. Being rational about that doesn't make one weak or a poor worker - just realistic. It's corporations and those who support their structures who argue otherwise in an attempt to shame people into accepting harder work than they ought to.

""A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the ""Clean Break"" report) is a policy document that was prepared in **1996** by a study group led by **Richard Perle** for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on ""Western values"". **It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"".**

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm)

[The actual policy report](http://www.israeleconomy.org/strat1.htm)

There's no time frame for the attacks stated anywhere and the plan to take out Iraq happened which was also taken as policy a year later after the report for Israel by the US.


""The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. established in **1997** as a non-profit educational organization founded by **William Kristol** and **Robert Kagan**. The PNAC's stated goal is ""to promote American global leadership.""[1] Fundamental to the PNAC were the view that ""American leadership is both good for America and good for the world"" and support for ""a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.""[2] **With its members in numerous key administrative positions, the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.**

Americas document was thought up and had signatories that have ties to Israel (neocons) and they were also elected after writing this policy recommendation into the Bush Administration.

The same people that are part of all this still continue to sit on think tanks and spread themselves out into satellite organisations and call for intervention in Syria, but it all leads back to the same people.


""But Weiss is not only a blogger. He's also the director of communications and public relations at the Henry Jackson Society, an ultra-ultra-hawkish foreign policy thinktank.

The Henry Jackson Society's international patrons include: James ""ex-CIA boss"" Woolsey, Michael ""homeland security"" Chertoff, **William ""PNAC"" Kristol**, **Robert ""PNAC"" Kagan**', Joshua ""Bomb Iran"" Muravchick, and **Richard ""Prince of Darkness"" Perle**. The Society is run by Alan Mendoza, chief adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on transatlantic and international security.

The Henry Jackson Society is uncompromising in its ""forward strategy"" towards democracy. And Weiss is in charge of the message. The Henry Jackson Society is proud of its PR chief's far-reaching influence: ""He is the author of the influential report ""Intervention in Syria? An Assessment of Legality, Logistics and Hazards"", which was repurposed and endorsed by the Syrian National Council.""

 Unlike the US, the UK has heavy regulation in place as far as drilling, well construction, drilling permits, transparency of chemicals used etc and these exploratory wells are being very closely monitored for everything from seismic activity, to radiation leakage, to water usage, to possible water contamination, to environmental damage to see what's happening throughout the whole process. 

This data will be then be thoroughly analysed before any fracking companies are ever given the go ahead.

Eriksen's best matches have been the matches against the best teams. He's best performances have been against PSV, Twente, City, Feyenoord, and he's always our best player in every Champions League match. He does not suffer against physical sides, in fact he seems to thrive in avoiding duels ([This move vs Milner for example](http://i.minus.com/ijn7iBUK1ma16.gif), [0:58 in this video for a better view, it's hard to tell from the gif.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xyl5t3_eriksen-vs-manchester-city-1st-leg_creation)), he actually plays better against them. I think it's because he doesn't have to think as much. At Ajax, his criticisms are that he doesn't carry us enough against lesser sides, when that is when you'd expect your stars to be doing everything easily. Similar criticisms were given to Vertonghen before his last season, because they are both pretty nonchelant players. In Jan's case it was because he couldn't seem to care as much against those teams, and for Eriksen is that against bad teams, our tempo drops, and so it become less instinct football, and he will sometimes end up overthinking things and get stuck. However, with better players around him, playing against better teams, he will not have these problems, and so I expect him to be able to even play at teams like Bayern in the future, and at teams like Spurs at the moment.",0,1377701380,null,0,false,0,cbwzpcb,t3_1l8gg7,t1_cbwzpcb,t1_cbwx79y,null,1429671581,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Some very grindy and efficient games.  The team looks better organized, especially when playing defense.  It's not as fun to watch as those wide open attacking games, but it definitely makes me happy to see them play better as a unit.

Possible line-up:

I think we go with a physical, organized, great on the counter line-up.  We're not out passing Bayern, it's just not where we are in the team's development.  Hopefully Luiz and Mikel are healthy, it does not look like Mata will be fit for a full 90 though.

Cech

Azi, Iva, Luiz, Cole

Mikel, Ramires

Schurrle, Oscar, Hazard

Torres

I'd love to see Lukaku get some playing time, but I think the stakes are a little high to give him his first run-out.  Torres is dependable in the context of staying organized and dropping deeper, though I think Lukaku brings a strong dimension upfront.

Mikel I think is perfect where he is, especially when Luiz can step up and either initiate or surge from the back.  In fact, all the defenders can press a little higher because of their greater pace and endurance than if it was Cahill/Terry.

Schurrle showed a lot of composure and energy on the wing at OT, and Hazard on-form will help pin those wingbacks, but even off-form he's able to track and harass.  Ramires without the responsibility of passing will be free to play his high-energy game.  Ramires+Schurrle will really press and defend Bayern's excellent wings and attackers.

Oscar I think has been fantastic throughout the summer until now.  Perfect discipline, excellent touch, imaginative passing, tough marking, and totally unselfish.

Mikel and Oscar, they're the midfield dynamos and generals, Chelsea's organization and passing will ride on them. ",0,1377701416,null,0,false,0,cbwzptb,t3_1l8wmo,t1_cbwzptb,t3_1l8wmo,null,1429671575,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"re: 1 - There is no lack of evidence that a chemical weapon attack involving something akin to Sarin took place, and evidence that it has happened before albeit on a smaller scale. Regardless which side pulled the trigger, non-combatants are being killed on a large scale by conventional and non-conventional weapons. I think that other nations have a duty to step in at this point, and view the idea that we should just ignore it with disdain. 

re: 2 - It is indeed a tricky situation to get right. So we have 2 choices, go in with overwhelming force, remove Assad and suppress the militants, then use the occupying force to secure the country for a humanitarian effort. And importantly we need to do things like keep the power and water on/restore them, supply food, employ (and pay) the locals to rebuild and setup a civilian police force to provide basic security. An actual peace keeping effort, not an Iraq style boondoggle. Very expensive to do, logistically and political complex, and there is a lack of will to see it through once the exciting bits are done with.

The second choice is that we just go in, secure and destroy the non-conventional weapons, then leave. Complex and expensive, but something we can achieve.

re: 3 - This is why we need to ensure that the Arab League backs this effort and provides combat troops and police. Without them we can't really do this.

There isn't going to be a democratic sit down between both sides (not unless we force them to it at gun point), this is going to carry on until one side has killed enough of the other side to ""win"".

true,way2ooskeptic,null,null,"Let me add a few more to this excellent list:

- Write a list of all the questions you have about your problem before you visit the doctor. If, say you have tummy pain, and you suspect that you should not be eating carrots, put it on that list and make sure you ask your doctor if it is OK to eat carrots. Most patients confess to being nervous during the appointment and forgetting to ask questions. This will increase your satisfaction levels and also reduce need of repeat appointments just to ask a question which neither your doctor nor you will enjoy.

- Doctors are trained to reassure patients above all and most of them do that really well. Sometimes this is not distinguishable from doctor not taking your complaint seriously. Doctors are human and they sometimes make judgements about patients. If you feel that is the case make sure you correct this.

- Before leaving, always ask the doctor what is their 'treatment plan'. This is different from doctor saying 'Please get these tests done and take this medicine twice a day'. A treatment plan sounds more like. ""We are doing some tests to make sure we know what is really wrong with your head. We will get results of these tests in a week. Chances are that tests will be normal. If they are not we will contact you and you may need an operation. Meanwhile, take these medicines twice a day. Normally these medicines take about 2 weeks to at. If you are not better in two weeks come and see me again"". 

Ninja Level Trick (used by super patients, doctors may not like this)

- When doctor tells you their diagnosis, listen to everything they have to say and understand it. Now politely ask ""what is your differential diagnosis?"". This means, if the primary diagnosis is not correct what might you have. This is really something very important. All diagnoses are based on probabilities until they are proven so it is important to know that the doctor has thought through other probabilities before jumping to conclusion.

When using this YMMV. Some doctors will take this as you second guessing their diagnostic ability but remember it is your life. Doctors are wrong many times and you dont want to die because you were too shy to ask a question.

Holtby was playing many senior games in his last season for Shalke, and Siggy for Swansea, but it's hard to say they were as key as Eriksen.

Point is, it'll be interesting to see how he is with the rotation (of which there will, presumably, be lots). I'd like us to develop one of the 3 into our #10, but I think they're some way off.

Siggy has been a key part of his national team for some time now, which is good. Whilst Holtby has shone in the German U21's, but Eriksen, on the flipside, a key member of his national team, has not done particularly well.

I'd say that Eriksen can shine, but I'd also like to see Holtby and Siggy get their game time! It'll be interesting to see how each of them develop.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"Honestly, having *been* a teenage lad who read those magazines for a few years, I don't recall anything as ridiculous or questionable as some of the stuff I've read in Cosmo over the years.

Some sketchy stuff about ""encouraging"" your partner to be more adventurous, sure, but nothing that takes the kind of cavalier ""hey, just do it and fuck 'em if they can't take a joke"" attitude Cosmo tended (tends?) to take.

Likewise, while there was frequently crude humour in Loaded, FHM and the like it was generally clearly lampshaded as such, such that even the stupidest or most hormonal teenage boy could recognise it.  Cosmo, on the other hand, has always cultivated the tone and approach of an earnest but weirdly passive-aggressive older sister, and I've heard numerous tales of young girls lead astray by taking its straight-faced advice at face value.

Likewise, I recall seeing plenty of lads' mags glorify drinking, ""pulling girls"" and promiscuous sex as ""manly"" (and reinforcing plenty of other traditional masculine gender-roles), but I've seen comparatively little in them actively encouraging boys to abuse or denigrate women.  Conversely I've lost count of the number of times I've seen magazines like Cosmopolitan promoting the idea that unless your man is a fashionable, energetic, charismatic, affluent professional who pays for every date and gives you three orgasms a night then he's a ""loser"".  About the only thing you can say about Cosmo's attitudes to gender-equality is that it's even *more* hostile to women than men - although it usually prefers to subtly but constantly undermine women's confidence and self-opinion in a million little ways, rather than writing overt articles about how they're failures as people if they don't possess a laundry-list of unrealistic attributes.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not advocating either one as a sensible source of sexual techniques or inter-gender communication skills... it just seems incredibly ludicrous to be criticising magazines like Loaded for ""encouraging sexism"" or ""rape apologism"" when if anything magazines like Cosmo do *more* to promote sexism and objectification of both men and women, and are the only mainstream magazine I've ever seen *actively encouraging* rape.",0,1377702034,null,0,false,0,cbwzxb0,t3_1l9213,t1_cbwzxb0,t1_cbwzkf1,null,1429671478,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

Saudi Arabia in particular want to spread their extreme version of Islam into Syria, the US shadowing what Israel want is to take out the supply route to Hezbollah and to weaken a regional actor where Iran is concerned. 

You can understand why there is a massive dose of skepticism here because I don't want to look at this in just the context of this being a humanitarian mission - it isn't and none of the interventions I've seen in the Middle East have been humanitarian based. There is a huge mix of desires and geo-politics at work here. I'm not suggesting Assad is the good guy and the killing needs to stop, but our position is utterly hypocritical and transparent.

Because to me, the worst offender has to be the Daily Mail then probably the gossip rags aimed squarely at women.

Lads mags are normally along the lines of **** she's got a lovely ****.  Simplistic and that's it.

Womans mags are all See how she lost 4lbs, guess who's to fat to wear a bikini.

I would argue the latter is a worse kind of gratification.  Also thanks to having the internet at a young age, my views on womens body were founded on things pre-photoshop thanks to my extensive erm research interests.  Maybe with a slight bias to men with huge dicks, but the women whilst on the higher end of the physically attractive scale, were still less than 1 SD from the mean, and importantly not photoshopped.

An ex of mine who used to like spending Sunday watching eastenders and reading that shite, never understood that these magazines were not promoting natural bodies at all.  I don't just mean they were picking the top 10 percentile of women.  They aren't.  They are picking probably the top quartile and then photoshopping the hell out of them.

That does more to make women be treated as objects.  Far more.

Unless there is some evidence between a link, I can't see any argument for a ban on these lads mags at all.

Your GP/Doctor can normally get you started. It's often as simple as calling up the Doctors and telling them what you want. They'll then sort you out with a Nurse/Doctor appointment as necessary. Nurses can perform simple medical procedures (e.g. if you're having the Implant in your arm) but a Doctor needs to prescribe any medication. 

**Sexual Health Clinics**

These are found in most decent sized cities. A google search should turn them up easily. Often they're in Boots branches (certainly in Birmingham and Cardiff). There are also some Brook ones. These are staffed by medical types too, and specialise in this. 

My partner and I have chosen this route. You'll need to go in twice, once for a briefing (certainly if it's long term contraceptives you're after) then back again to have it issued to you. They'll also throw a huge amount of condoms and lube at you...

They're here for the long haul. This club isn't another yacht to them. Its not a place for their egos. They won't ""meddle"" in how the manager they hire manages the team. 

I know fans have been discontented that we missed out on Willian. That, I would say, is only signing this summer (we know about) that was axed by FSG. If it ends with us getting Moses though, I'd be beyond happy. 

FSG is a stabilizer. We're looking set to go forward this year with some strength. Our squad is capable of placing 5th and, with luck that is absolutely apart of the game, capable of 4th.

If we can skip above Arsenal or Tottenham we will effectively increase our chances of getting the next Mickey or Costa. So instead of outlaying funds on unproven players, we can get guys who've proved their ability at the top levels.

FSG aren't owner who are going to drop obscene amounts of cash to get us to the top.

And quite often these players skip vital development. For example there were loads of players that have been involved in the senior team that would have been able to play for the U21 tournament this summer, but instead played for the senior side in couple of friendlies. Tournament experience is something you can't match, no matter how many friendlies you play.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Now we're just getting silly, aren't we? 

&gt; This country has a problem, atleast when compared to other countries.

Indeed, it offers good standards of care across the board (to those with and without the funds) - and poor education is not doing a sufficient job in preparing many young people with relevant, useful qualifications - they're free to pick and choose as they see fit which allows them to follow their interests but not necessarily whatever would make them the most employable. 

Meanwhile tough economic times are forcing employers to penny-pinch wherever they can and it's easy to justify pay freezes and less-than-stellar spending on the workforce in order to keep the shareholders happy. I invite you to visit Google for all the evidence you need on that one. 

At the same time we find conditions abroad - despite the odds - are worse than in the UK and so despite *our* situation not being great, it still seems like a blessing to those coming from overseas. They can and will choose to gladly accept menial and low paid roles because any alternative is better. 

The employer then finds themselves in a great position where they *have* a workforce prepared to work for peanuts and can guilt-trip anyone who complains with claims that overseas workers are harder, better workers. 

Nobody likes being made to feel inadequate or lesser. That's why military recruitment campaigns challenge the reader to ""see if they have what it takes"" - implying of course that they do not. ""Want to be a real man? Join up and find out - if you don't, you're sure as hell not a real man"".

&gt;  Can you find anything positive?

This made me laugh, but let's take a look at what Google comes back with, blow by blow (in order): 

* A year old blog post by a Charlie Keeble - a blogger with 38 profile views to date. 

* A question posted on a forum.

* A Daily Mail news article from 2009. 

* Another opinion piece, this time from the Guardian and strangely pointing out that fixing the work ethic is ""not the answer to the economic mess"".

* An article by the Telegraph from 2011, again implying that workers should stay till midnight if the need arises (actually a rational argument, provided it's not abused). 

* A 2012 piece by the BBC reporting on a suggestion by - you guessed it - a Tory MP. 

* A 2010 radio piece reporting on folks from hard-up areas. 

* A broken link. 

* Another blog piece. 

All in all, we're hardly staring at conclusive evidence, are we? Just a lot of opinion pieces for the most part. Perhaps if there *is* an issue with the British work ethic, we should look at why that is? Perhaps the way in which the working day is set up - the way people are asked to work - the rewards they are given for doing so and so on might all play a part in their interest in really working hard for the company that employs them? 

Perhaps employees think that the disparity between the work they're asked to do and the [rewards that CEO's can enjoy](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=difference+in+worker+pay+vs+coe&amp;oq=difference+in+worker+pay+vs+coe&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.4397j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fp=b36d95f046bf0937&amp;q=difference+in+worker+pay+vs+ceo+uk) are out of control? Would *you* put in the extra effort as a supermarket cashier, knowing that the upper managers of the company enjoy vast sums more than you can expect to ever see from the role? 

You accuse me of being naive.. I think it's naive to think that the 'working man' should gladly sweat out 100 hours a week for low wages in tough conditions. Those that are willing to do so are glad that they can drink clean tap water - we're a developed country - and shouldn't be in a race to reach the bottom. 

Delusional? Read above. 

Apologist? Every time. Some jobs are harder than others and some jobs are more technical than others - some require far greater responsibility. But expecting anyone to be glad at their chance to work 90% of the hours in their working week whilst sleeping the rest? I don't blame them at all for not wanting to do so. There's more to life than work - working 100 hour weeks won't let you have a shot at it.

I don't know your background, you don't know mine. I was fortunate growing up to not live on a council estate and to not go hungry for food. I moved out of my home quite a few years ago, I earn the food I eat.

A lot of people see the advert and it washes over them. But some people, impressionable teenagers for example, are going to affected by this and it will affect the way they treat women. Arguing that the things we read in magazines and the internet don't affect us is naive.

In any case, the point of my reply was that voting for parties such as the Socialists - which have no chance whatsoever of gaining seats - is pointless and just serves to weaken parties of the left which actually have a chance.

Well considering we haven't lost yet, I'd say pretty good. Our defense has def looked better since Mou took over, I'm just a little nervous in the attacking sense.

Considering there isnt much riding on this game, I think Lukaku, VG, and Schur will be deployed. I also think we will see players like Hazard, Lamps, Terry, Cole, and Oscar rested because of how much they have played already. I expect the lineup to look something like this:

----------Cech----------

Azpi--Cahill--Luiz--Betrand

-------Mikel----VG--------

KDB------Mata------Schur

--------Lukaku-----------

With Hazard, Oscar, and Torres subbing in.

There's a lot of countries that have mainly 2 or 3 horse races these days though.

Italy - AC / Inter / Juventus

Spain - Real / Barcelona

France - PSG / Marseille (Lyon recently admittedly)

England - Chelsea / Man Utd / Man City

Germany - Bayern / Dortmund

Holland - Ajaz / PSV / Feyenoord

Portugal - Porto / Benfica / Sporting

There are always going to be the odd teams that upsets the table either as a one off or for a few years (AZ, Twente in Holland, Valencia in Spain), but given the choice, most players would choose the teams that are most consistent in Europe. That means Spain, maybe Italy.

Other than that, then I suppose it's whoever will pay the highest wages, as PSG and Monaco are proving now. Christ, Monaco were in Ligue 2 last season, have no European football this season, yet have still convinced a load of top class players to sign for them.

I still disagree with your equivocation Daveime. Whilst I appreciate both things are illegal and would benefit small groups of society, theft has a VERY strong negative impact on the victim. One could say that cannabis legalisation will have a negative impact on certain members of society, but they will be nothing like the damage that theft does at a societal level.

Sure there will be difficulties, sure there will be obstacles to overcome, but the realities of legalization are something to consider once we have persuaded the powers that be that it isn't the Class B substance they have incorrectly decided that it is.

The medicinal argument is the road to legalization. Legalization is the right thing to do (or is at least preferable to the current state of affairs).

Kolo's groin strain:

Grade 1 Groin Strain
In grade 1, there is no major strain on the muscles. A small number of muscle fibers are slightly torn, but they don't incapacitate the person. The impact is felt after the activity. The muscles can function properly. Mild groin strain recovery takes anything between 2 days to 10 days. Resting the thigh muscles and using ice and compression will be adequate in this case for pulled groin recovery.

Grade 2 Groin Strain
A grade 2 strain is a bit more serious than grade 1. Its effects are felt immediately by the person. The injury and strain will affect the walking and make it very painful and the area affected will be sore to touch. The function of the muscle fibers will be affected in case of this injury and thus it will increase the recovery time. In this type of injury, the pulled groin recovery time can be around 6 weeks.

Grade 3 Groin Strain
The most severe, in grade 3 strain all the muscles are ruptured and there is a considerable loss of function. There is excruciating groin pain and considerable bruising as a result of internal bleeding. This can take anything between 1 to 2 months or longer, depending on the treatment and how severe is the tear.

It looked pretty bad and with his age, I estimate he'll be out for 8 weeks at least. Maybe he'll make his comeback away at Arsenal in November?

All I know is in the last two summer transfer windows we've sold our three best players.

Nuts, Loaded and their ilk aren't considered pornography by any but the most censorious, prudish viewpoints - rather, they're magazines full of articles that *also* happen to contain one or two photoshoots of women (moreover IIRC - and again unlike pornography - with genitals and nipples obscured) per issue.

Regarding the images of women on the cover this is true, but one can make the case that magazines like [bodybuilding magazines](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bodybuilding+magazines&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=vCUeUrf1M67b7Aa4sYH4BQ&amp;biw=1524&amp;bih=612&amp;sei=yiUeUt3LAuTd7QaJ4oGACw) also feature artfully posed near-naked bodies, and (at least, in my experience) disproportionately tend to feature men on most of them... again, without any criticism or complaint by anyone.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not defending the *tastefulness* of lads' mags like FHM or Loaded - merely tentatively suggesting that by any *empirical, objective* measure they aren't any more demonstrably objectionable than other magazines which pass without comment (when judged either by their covers or by their content).",0,1377707591,null,0,1377731437,0,cbx1xjl,t3_1l9213,t1_cbx1xjl,t1_cbx17ap,null,1429670471,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

What is misogynist about ""lad culture""? The usual answer is this ""it teaches men to view women as their sexual property thus encourages rape.""

The only problem is that it... doesn't. Certain insecure young men may appear to reduce women down to their attractiveness, but the reality is that their sexuality is not wired that way. 

Look through any of those magazines and see the proportion of models who are _looking directly at the camera_ versus those who are looking away.

In lad mags as in pornography and pin ups the overwhelming majority of the women are looking at the camera directly. This is an assertive position that emphasizes the model's _subjectivity_. In particular it emphasizes the model's desire for the viewer himself.

These magazines aren't selling women's inert bodies, they're selling the impression that these attractive women _desire the men who are looking at the magazine._ What is attracting these guys is the feeling of being desired by someone desirable. What's attracting these guys is the exact opposite of sexual objectification.

The supposed health risks of depleted uranium are an entirely unscientific fabrication by scaremongers in the media and groups with particular agenda. It is similar to the 'MMR jabs cause autism' nonsense - absolutely no proof but a self-perpetuating fallacy. The only supposed evidence that these people have offered is pictures of deformed Iraqi children and saying ""depleted uranium did this!""

Studies have shown that even veterans with actual pieces of depleted uranium rounds stuck in their bodies did not show any adverse symptoms. 

Sources from the [IAEA](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/features/du/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml) and the [WHO](http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/pub_meet/en/Depluraniumintro.pdf)  

The author refers to Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, but ignores the text of the protocol:

&gt;PROTOCOL ON PROHIBITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE
OF INCENDIARY WEAPONS
(PROTOCOL III)
Article 1. DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this Protocol:
1. ""Incendiary weapon"" means any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat, or a combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the
target.

&gt; (b) Incendiary weapons do not include:
(i) Munitions which may have incidental incendiary effects, such as illuminants, tracers,
smoke or signalling systems;

(Page 171 of [this treaty](http://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/UNTS/Volume%201342/v1342.pdf))

White Phosphorus is clearly excluded from this definition of incendiary weapons, and in operation Cast Lead the Israelis only used White Phosphorus for screening and marking purposes and only in unpopulated areas.

White Phosphorus is a perfectly valid weapon of war when used appropriately - [this source](http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/bio/factsheets/whitephosphorusfactsheet.html) gives a good overview of its uses and effects.

Even if white phosphorus had been used as an incendiary weapon this would not necessarily constitute a war crime as the author of this article suggests. Contravention of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is not a war crime in itself, as the convention is not among the international treaties on the law of war which are binding, and which contravention of would constitute a war crime.

It is complete nonsense to suggest that the UK, US or Israel has used Chemical Weapons in modern times in the way that it is portrayed in this article, or in the way that it is alleged that Assad has used them in Syria.

Come on, Nuts is obviously soft-core porn. The definition of porn is not dependent on whether or not genitals or nipples are exposed, that really is prudery - for instance, the attitude they have about breasts in the states. Porn is defined partly by nudity, and partly by tone and context.

true,SerPuissance,cnty-wales,Clarks pie innit,"The schpiel is that we're protecting civvies from chemical weapons. But there is more at stake here, any excuse to topple a non-cooperative state in the region weakens opposition against Western influence. The reason that all the dictators have been put down recently is that they ceased to be useful to Western interests, so they were afforded no protections when they were found in dicthes and shot in the face. Personally, I think that the whole region needs to be left alone to go through what we went through between the collapse of the Roman  Empire and the end of the Second World War. There will be atrocities, there will be bloodshed, there will be pain and sadness - it may sound trite but ""child states"" need to run into walls to learn not to do it. We went through it, now I believe it's their turn. Horrible, but I don't think intervention is helping in the long run.

Anyone who thinks this is anything other than a reconsolidation of Western power in the Middle East to ensure the continuing supply of oil is simply wrong. There will never be peace in the Middle East until there's not a drop of oil left in the ground and the whole place is useless to everybody.

When I say ""The West"" I do not mean all of us. People outside the West think that everyone from the PM down is in on the conspiracy. The truth is that most of us are too busy trying to pay our bills and get by to notice what's really going on. We are dupes, and the powers that be have bought our silence with high living standards afforded by cheap energy for decades.

You seem to be suggesting that these questions haven't occurred to people in government. These people have experience of this from Libya and they will no doubt be considering these questions - how to capture these chemical weapons before the rebels, how to ensure there is no violence afterwards? They aren't however going to detail their military strategy on national TV for us all to see. 

Any power vacuum will be quickly replaced by elections. The US isn't going to install another dictator - this isn't the Cold War any more, you can't get away with it. They didn't in Egypt, they didn't in Libya, they didn't in Tunisia when they had a chance so what makes you think they will in Syria? 

&gt;the Al Qaeda/Al Nusra forces, who have plenty of training and thanks to us

Don't know where you getting this. We gave non-lethal aid the Free Syrian Army, a secular group of rebels. 

There may well need to be troops on the ground but no doubt in small numbers to co-ordinate a security force in the country and oversee elections. I'm hoping in fact that the UN will oversee elections even if it didn't agree to the missile strikes. That will remove any implication of occupation. Al Qaeda and Al Nusra are both Sunni groups. Assad is Shia and you would expect them to hate Assad. I'm not sure you would expect them to have the same vitriol toward a Sunni leader elected by the 60% Sunni majority. Your speculating based on the useless conduct in Iraq. You can't expect these two interventions to go the same way - no least because one will involve a few missile strike and air superiority (based on a blueprint that seemed to at least help somewhat is Libya) but without an invasion while the other was a 10 year long occupation with no plan. 

I'd rather hold a passport of a country that actually backs up it's high-minded 'We believe in human rights and democracy' rhetoric with actual actions. As I said before if we can't really believe those things if we refuse to support the rights of Syrians like our own.

Here's what I put in, but I have (yet) to finish it. I was honest on page 1, and then started getting irritated on page 2 and finally pissed off on page 3.

Page1:

Q1:How do we go further in publishing – and getting practices to publish – an increasing range of comparative public information?

A1: Start using social media, apps, billboards, bus stops, TV ads, etc. to engage the public.

Q2: How can we best work in partnership with CQC and the new Chief Inspector role whose inspections and ratings regime is designed to improve transparency?

A2: By removing the ""mistakes are OK"" attitude when it comes to patient treatments and come clean (aka be more transparent, don't just pretend to be).

Q3: How do we stimulate new forms of patient involvement and insight, including introducing the Friends and Family Test in general practice?

A3: See A1.

Q4: How best do we roll out new models of patient choice?

A4: Advertisement and plain, simple advice. See A1.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Page2:

Q1: How can we best stimulate and create space for clinically-led innovation?

A1: Engage your students, the public, etc. Do not ""hire"" a government consultant.

Q2: How can we challenge and support local health communities, including CCGs and health and wellbeing boards, to develop more stretching ambitions for primary care?

A2: I don't understand what ""stretching ambitions for primary care"" means. Provide the service they need. Do not attempt to lie to the public.

Q3: How do we best support integration pioneers in testing new ways of commissioning and contracting for integrated primary care and community services for people with physical and mental health conditions?

A3: I would imagine that people with Physical and/or Mental health conditions are your primary patients - so my question is how are they treated already? No one wants a contractor paid by the hour/numbers to fix them!

Q4: How can we best mobilise existing improvement resource (e.g. NHS IQ) and facilitate access to other potential external support for primary care transformation?

A4: Mobilised existing improvement resources and enhancing access to potential 3rd parties should not be in charge of primary care transformation. Unless you're talking about a free bus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 3: 

Q1: How might we develop QOF so that that we preserve its essential features but create more flexibility for practices and reduce the feel of a tick-box culture?

A1: I do not understand what QOF is? Quality of...?

Q2: How can we get best value from enhanced services and reduce process-oriented measures?

A2: What are the enhanced services? What are the process-oriented measures? Without context your question doesn't mean anything.

Q3: How should general practice IT systems develop to support more efficient and integrated working?

A3: Finally, something I can answer. Copy Estonia.

Q4: How can we help improve the productivity of practice systems and processes, for example through the Productive General Practice programme?

A4: It's good there is an example in this question. It also requires me to research what the example is. The question is moot by requiring improvement.

Q5: How can we help ensure that practices are making most effective use of all practice staff, including practice nurses and practice managers?

A5: Are people responding better to staff, questionnaires and treatment? Has overall healthcare in the areas these people are responsible for improved?

Q6: How do we engage practice managers more effectively?

A6: Challenge them on results and do not promote/reward failure.

It's the question everybody wants, nay needs, an answer to regarding Tottenham's latest summer addition to the squad.**

Erik Lamela. The 21 year-old inside forward that some Roma fans had pegged as the 'heir to Totti', announced today by his club as an incoming Spurs player. Anyone who's seen the youngster plying his trade on the pitch over the past few years will agree that the Argentine can bring flair and threat to White Hart Lane. But none of that is in any way relevant or important, because as we all know, Tottenham Hostpur HC is a Hair Club For Men first and a football club second. With that thought in mind, let's take a look at the assessments of the CFC staff writers of Erik Lamela's hair's chances of cracking the Spurs first team.

+++

Ed Francis: When we were first linked with Erik Lamela earlier in this window, I can't pretend that I wasn't a little skeptical. Though still images and highlights reels on YouTube proved to me that he has some immense capacity for stylish hair grooming, I worried simply that the strength of his delicate Argentinian follicles couldn't stand up to the punishment they'd take in a more physical league like the Premiership. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what his hair does better than that of any of our existing squad members' too. His style lacks the classic rugged durability of Etienne Capoue and Mousa Dembele's closely cropped 'dos; yet it also fails on the other end of the spectrum to match up to the understated finesse of Nacer Chadli's coiffed barnet. In general, Lamela's overuse of hair wax occasionally means that his mane occasionally looks a little rough around the edges. For all of these reasons, in hair terms, I can only question whose role Erik Lamela could possibly supplant going forward for Spurs this season.

Luckily, I know as much about good grooming as I do football, so against everything I just said his hair will probably turn out to be hugely important and influential for Spurs going forward this season.

Kevin McCauley: I think that Erik Lamela needs to change his hair role to truly succeed in our system. What we're lacking is a Marek Hamsik-style mohawk. If Lamela can adopt some of Hamsik's style in his hair game, we could have a real gem.

The Sleeper's Sleep: The loss of Scotty Parker / David Bentley sweeping side-parts has me worried.

Uncle Menno: You all are forgetting that Lamela's hair is ostensibly replacing Bale's hair in the lineup. No one player's coif can possibly be expected to replace that amount of hair product. I think we all need to temper our expectations of Lamela's hair, at least initially. We need to ensure that as a fan base we're allowing adequate time for Lamela's hair to grow.


MCofA: I like statistics as much as the next guy, but without context statistics are nothing. While my colleagues discuss the hair, I want to focus on the cheekbones. No coiffure exists in a vacuum, it must be attached to a face and bring out the underlying characteristics of that face. Lamela's near-perfect bone structure gives him a classically angular visage, drawing focus to his deep-set, soulful eyes and distinct cheekbones. A haircut which extends from only the top of his skull, like the barely-faux hawk he has sported in the past, risks drawing attention away from the bone structure or worse, unbalancing his previously symmetrical appearance. I think it is notable that 90% of Lamela's SiBoT in Serie A (**) have been produced in games where Lamela's stylist allowed a little bit of volume to the coif on the sides of his head, creating a more traditional side-sweep cut in the style of a Paul Wesley. His potential is nearly boundless, but he will need a manager who can explain that within the complex demands a high-pressing, vertical-passing system, you need a haircut that works within the context of your facial structure.

**Source: Whoscoredandhowwastheirhair.com

Bryan A.: I think when you have the opportunity to add a young head of hair, such as Lamela's to your squad you have to do it. Sure the price is a bit high, but Lamela's hair has shown a lot more potential than say Adam Maher or Jordy Clasie. At this point Spurs have a lot of money to spend, and Lamela's hair could potentially be a superstar.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that Erik Lamela is 21. His hair still has plenty of time to grow into its potential. While Tottenham have a lot of classically-coifed players, Lamela's 'do is much more forward thinking. This is the kind of hairstyle that Spurs need if they're going to score with young fans. I know that we may not see the benefit that his hair adds to the club right now, but it's definitely one for the future.

Lennon's Eyebrow: I think it's important that we don't neglect his incredible follicular diversity. We all know that Lamela has incredible natural hair, but with the right grooming its potential is boundless. He's only 21 and he's already shown an impressive array of versatility in his styling choices. With product or without, spiked or laying flat, shaved sides or a classy part, he clearly has the adaptability to fit into whatever gap the team's overall style is missing. His hair's god-given gifts are impressive, but his real strength is in his phenomenal ability to style it in so many different ways.
Skipjack: Guys the important thing to remember is that he's only 21. He has incredible potential for growth here. Not just in terms of fullness or length, but in regards to style and substance. He already has a fantastic follical foundation to further his future on. Look at some of his colleagues like Mario Balotelli, whose hair changes his hair style like a pair of socks or Al Sharraway, who's hair could double as a balloon genocide machine or a runway for hotwheels. Lamela's almost, but not quite, blow out already shows more maturity. Perhaps more importantly it shows confidence. His hair will not only bring a swagger to Spurs but the kind of rigidity and spine we need to compete against well coiffed teams like Arsenal and Chelsea. And with a front line of Soldado and Townsend, Lamela will add some much needed flair to our folical front line.",0,1377710845,null,0,false,0,cbx36ms,t3_1l9rnt,t1_cbx36ms,t3_1l9rnt,null,1429669886,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

I deny it, at least in the sense you are claiming. I believe there are aspects of our society, members of it, which are sexist. but society itself for the most part treats both men and women as equals. In some areas, family law for example is incredibly against men, but the way through this is open discussion of the issues and debate.

In my opinion, the best way to stop men objectifying women in any sense of the word. first is proper sex education, not this wish washy crap we presently put up with. next stop magazines like cosmo doing articles like 10 ways to please your man, how to lose weight overnight, , and other demeaning shit like that, or at the very least stop letting pre-pubescent and young teenage girls from reading them(the latter is my preference, i'm against censorship for adults). Teach the girls to respect themselves, so when a guy does something which potentially demeans them, they turn around and say no. Trust me on this, if the girls start telling boys not to do things, they'll stop doing them. Both sexes need to be taught how treat each other with respect otherwise we take the lessons from other sources, such as certain rap songs which do treat women as hoes. If the girls then respond positively to being treated as a hoe by acting like a hoe, then the boy will expect it.

FSG are new to the football business it'll take time to get the proper administration infrastructure in place on both the business side and the footballing side. It will take some time in order for those now in charge of transfers to become competent and persistent in doing good business. It is going to take Brendan some time to grow into the position of LFC manager. We know he has a certain way he wants the team to play, but we've seen from the beginning of last year to this season that he has become increasingly pragmatic in his approach to the game. I think he still has some room for improvement, and, since he appears to be a serious student of the game, I think he indeed will become a better manager. It'll also take some time for our investment in our youth system to pay off, both in terms of talent and playing style.

Other than that, no, you won't lose your place, and no, it's not too late to tell them and get support.  I'd find out who your course director is (this will probably be the same person as the admissions tutor, if not, the admissions tutor should be able to tell you who it is), and ask them what the process is.  They might want to do some kind of assessment to see what kind of support, if any, you need, get letters from your doctor, etc.

Most tutors will have something called ""office hours"", when you can make an appointment to talk one to one about your course with them; make an appointment in the first week to introduce yourself to each one in person and make them aware of any problems you might have, and do the same any time you feel you're having difficulties.

Unis are a lot better these days at supporting students with difficulties than they once were, don't be afraid to speak up, but also don't expect to use your disability as a crutch; you're an adult now, you know what's appropriate.

There can also be a lag between the input and the outcome. For example, there are two major drivers of lung cancer- smoking and exposure to asbestos. If you reduce smoking, but the deaths carry on going up because of asbestos exposure, that doesn't mean that many lives have not been saved. Of course, in practice, both smoking and asbestos exposure have been reduced, but deaths are still going up, because of the multidecade lag between exposure and the emergence of symptoms. You could also have complicated multi-factor relationships.

For a start, I certainly was not saying that I wanted a culture of working 100 hours a week or being called work-shy. That's a bit extreme. Was it like that 20/30 years ago? Is it like that in foreign countries such as Poland, Canada or Australia?

There will be less jobs, less investment. I don't want to see this country become nothing more than a warnout welfare society.

It looks as though we are going to sell, and unless Bill succumbs to pressure- we will get more for Fellaini than he is worth, but that is not the issue. 

The issue is that Fellaini plays in a position that we are already grossly short of. Even if Fellaini stays we could do with at least 1 CDM to act as cover or challenge for a place in the first team- if Fellaini goes then we almost certainly need 2 of them. 

This is no secret either, anyone with half a brain and a defensive/ Ball winning mid on their books is well in the knowledge that (if Fella is sold) we are not only are desperate, but we have cash that we need to spend. The ideal situation would have been if we could talk to United quietly over the window, work out a deal and then do our own business before it is made public... Man Utd's need for a player like Fellaini, Moyes' previous relationship with Fellaini and them having money to spend has led the papers to run a mile with the story- essentially screwing any chance we had of picking up a replacement without the risk of being screwed by another chairman.

I have never seen them as the billionaire type owners that would come and just throw their own money about, while this can be good for some clubs (City, Chelsea) it can also go wrong (QPR).

They've done a lot right, the way they've gone about sponsorship deals has been positive and the redevelopment of Anfield has finally got some traction. I like the approach in focusing on young players, not just for the first squad but the lower ones too. There's a lot of good they have done, going forward I *think* we'll be ok, I don't think we'll be on the brink of administration again.

They have made some very high profile mistakes though in the first year or two, which I put down to them basically learning on the job.  I'd like to see John Henry show up a but more often, I can see why people would think that it's not a big deal, but having the big senior authority figure at the club around more often could only help. I wasn't happy with the Willian situation, not that we didn't get him (I never actually thought we would) but the refusal to put their full backing Rodgers, I know 30 million is a lot of money, but Rodgers seemed to really want him and they wouldn't back it, it was one big money player not 3 or 4, they went as far as 25m so I think they maybe could have pushed a bit further, we're past it now anyways and no point dwelling on it, I guess I'll find out in a years time if it was the correct call.

There's no excuse now for them not to back Rodgers for the rest of the window, I'm still kind of bemused that we haven't signed someone in about two months while Rodgers has been saying the whole time that we need 2 or 3 players, at the start of the window I honestly thought we'd have everything wrapped up by now, seeing as we really need to push on this season. 

We seem to be heading in a positive direction and I'm happy enough with them for moment but I don't have blind faith in them, just because they've done something similar with the Red Sox doesn't automatically mean it'll work out the same here, I do have my doubts as there is no guarantee everything will work out the way we hope.",0,1377713219,null,0,false,0,cbx44dd,t3_1l9gg2,t1_cbx44dd,t3_1l9gg2,null,1429669449,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

So if you live in Oklahoma, it makes sense to be a college fan because University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State are both quite good, and Oklahoma is lacking an NFL team.

Sticking your finger up a stranger's ass is sexual assault, yes. But it's a different situation if you are already blowing them.

Do you verbally ask permission for every single thing you do during foreplay? I'm going to lick your nipple now, is that OK? I'm going to nibble on your earlobe now, are you comfortable with that? I'm going to move from an up down motion with my tongue here to more application of my lower lip now, just a heads up, let me know if you aren't OK with that.

Continuing with something your partner indicates you to stop is abuse, sure, but no one actually goes through an itemised list of sex acts beforehand, with the possible exception of the BDSM community which, given what they're doing, is understandable. 

A finger is simply not comparable to suprise buttsex which does require preparation and advance warning/consent. It's a finger, it's much smaller. I wouldn't suggest ""jamming""  it up there but sneaking it up there, sure. And obviously stop if your partner doesn't want it.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"1 - new stock

I think in the short term all the Pendolinos on the WCML should be extended to 11 carriages.

Virgin's Voyager fleet should be replaced with a UK spec version of the [New Pendolino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pendolino) and new diesel locomotives purchased to haul them over non-electrified routes, eg Holyhead to Crewe.

2 - reopenings.

Agree completely, the East - West link is a good idea. Also I would like to see the proposed [Borders Railway](http://www.bordersrailway.co.uk) in Scotland extended through to Carlisle in the future if possible.

3 - signalling

The WCML needs [ETCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System), trouble is it's not due to get even [ETCS Level 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System#Level_2) until [2030](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/1185/1185we32.htm), by which time the line will apparently be at capacity.

What it really needs is [ETCS Level 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System#Level_3). That will give you [moving block](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_block) signalling which could improve headway and enhance capacity as I understand it.

As it stands now parts of the line are still being resignalled with new LED colour light signalling.

5 - electrification.

I have to disagree with you here.

Once routes like the Midland Main Line and Great Western are electrified there will be obvious schemes of follow-on and 'infill' electrification.

Bristol - Exeter would be a good choice for extending the Great Western for one. Past Exeter you have the problem of the historic railway through Dawlish which could be tricky to electrify. If you can get to Plymouth then might as well carry on to Penzance in the future.

Personally I would like to see Crewe - Chester - Holyhead electrified although Crewe - Chester will apparently be hard to do because of all the overbridges on that section of the route.

My [local line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_Line) could be easily added to Merseyrail if it was electrified, but it would need dual-voltage trains that can run off third rail or overhead wires.

Virgin want to run direct London trains to and from Shrewsbury, so add Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury to the list. Then you can do the [Welsh Marches line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Marches_Line). And so it would go on.

Plus as you electrify more of the rail network, you can withdraw the older diesels like Pacers and Sprinters and transfer the newer diesels (eg Class 170s) to the remaining non-electrified routes. Need electric trains? Keep Bombardier in Derby building trains like [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostar).

Put it this way: does he really warrant a spot in the team ahead of Henderson? Really, a player who we're bringing in on loan, ahead of a steadily improving one who we purchased for 16 million pounds?

He's not in the same league as our previous attacking targets (Mkhtaryan, Costa, Willian). While I consider him a welcome addition to replace Downing and Assaidi, especially given that the latter couldn't get a game, Chelsea's seventh-choice winger is not the signing I was counting on to solidify our top four aspirations. Not when Spurs are replacing Bale with both a 30 million euro player AND, as is looking likely, Christian Eriksen.

Other than that, absolutely critical that we bring in a center-back.

I would reccomend the older carbed fzs600 rather than the newer fuel injected ones, the older ones have more midrange and are a much better daily bike, I'd go for the older one after the facelift (2002 onwards).

I was specifically addressing the question of why Tesco stocks these magazines and not pornography - that the fact that these magazines don't exist *entirely or primarily* for the purposes of sexual titillation means they're popularly perceived as being more ""tasteful"" than outright pornography, and that's why Tesco stocks them but refuses to stock pornographic magazines.

Austrian Economics is a busted flush because it actively avoids using realistic data with it's theories (which are often somewhat nebulous).

Some feminists do feel that women should be able to do whatever they want and if that means getting their tits out for blokes to wank over then they should be allowed to do so as an act of empowerment.

A lot of other feminists believe that the damage caused to women in particular and society as a whole by encouraging the continuing sexual objectification of women is severe enough that such things should be campaigned against. 

To make a comparison in a non-sexual arena, would it be a good thing for people in general and society as a whole for people to be able to sell their organs for transplants? On the one hand someone should have choice over what happens to their bodies. On the other it would encourage the exploitation of the poor and the vulnerable. 

I don't believe there are many, if any feminists who see the hijab as a positive thing. Most seem to see it as an expression of patriarchal control over women. Have you heard otherwise?

&gt;I did not see any point you made about voting for the Socialist Party being pointless and weakening parties to the left as you did not say that.

Not in so many words. When I was saying that your kind of thinking was what kept Thatcher in power, I was referring to the Bennites and Militants in the 80s who ended up splitting the left because of their refusal to compromise and accept moderates over radical no-hopers like Michael Foot.

&gt;However, if everyone simply votes for parties that they think ""have a chance"" then there will never be change in this country as the Tory/Labour parties have undoubtedly failed us

You see, this is one of the reasons that I could never get along with the hard left - the idea that gradual change is no better than the status quo. Gradual change is how things get done in politics, and that's always been the case. Also, you can't just claim that the two main parties have 'undoubtedly failed' and provide no evidence to back that statement up.

&gt;Green party is nice and all but as they are still working within a capitalist system they will bring no real change, as we have seen with the cuts in Brighton

Please expand on this point. How exactly does Brighton show us that the Greens would be incapable of enacting change at a national level? As I said, they had no choice but to accept the cuts.

&gt;And UKIP, please...

Who mentioned UKIP?!

&gt;Unless people can address the fact that there is no silver bullet, magical cure for our problems...we will not see a solution

true,kinggareth,flair8,,"I see the ratings breaking down like this:
Gk-Lloris will remain a beast. Should be at least an 85 imo. 

Defense- full back will still be our lowest rated position, although rose should jump into the high 70s and walker should at least be an 80. Our CBs will be solid, as I don't see daws or kaboom going down any and Jan should move into the mid 80s (I think he is an 85 personally). BAE will stay a 78 and I don't have much of an idea about chiriches

Midfield- THIS is what will tell the story of both how Spurs are rated as a club and how the team plays in the game. IMO, we have the strongest midfield in the EPL. Dembele was massively underrated in '13 as was Sandro. Lennon is likely to stay as an 80. The additions of Paulinho (should be somewhere in the 80s) and Capoue (at least around 80) and possibly now Eriksen (already an 80) means that if '14 shows some love to a returning Sandro and moussa who had a great year than our midfield could be sick nasty. I didnt even include both Holtby and Siggy who should both be at lesst 78s if not close to 80. Honestly Gyfli got no love in '13 (except for his amazing free kick skills). Also worth noting, this should definitely be the year we see one Tommy Carroll break into the 70s in FIFA rankings (huge fan of that kid). It will still only be a club rating of around 81-82 for the midfield, but they will play MUCH better than that. 

Forwards- big question mark. Assuming Bale won't be in the squad (I hated typing that) we will have Soldado (low 80s before his prolific campaign last year), Chadli (likely to hit the 80 mark), Andros (hopefully in the high 70s to start the year), Defoe (should stay where he was at), Ade (prolly just an 80), and now Lamela (already an 82 likely to go up a bit). This line is much better and deeper than any attacking options we have had before. Because before, it was simply ""where do I put Bale so I can attack with him?""  Not to say Bale was the only Spurs man capable of scoring in '13, but honestly, we all know how beast he was playing friends and online, especially compared to our other attacking options. 

Is means we will still have at least one player in the 70s in our starting XI. While this does not exclude a club from being 5 stars, it will be tough for us to make the half star jump, unless there are multiple leagues with 5- 5 star clubs. FIFA like to maker the ""top"" clubs an exclusive group. 

That being said, I believe our squad will be even better in '14 to play with, as now we have quality everywhere on the pitch. A solid defense, a midfield capable of bossing any opponent, and forwards who still have pace, yet more strength and directness leading to better finishing. The future looks bright indeed. 


Now just to turn this future FIFA form into reality this campaign. Come On You Spurs!!!

But anyway, of all the ATOS compalints I've seen they seem to broadly fall into two categories:

* Dislike of the way ATOS conducts its contract. i.e. inflexible staff, unsympathetic service, poor scheduling etc. And this seems fair enough... the contract is valuable and it ought to be conducted with some degree of humility and sympathy.

* But by far the most prevalent, are actually people who simply dislike the idea of having their ascertion that they cannot work put to any sort of objective test. The problem is, when someone adopts the ""sick role"", by the time they reach ATOS its usually pretty embedded in their own self-identity that they cannot work... having that refuted by *experts* is obviously going to be a pretty unpleasent experience that casts into doubt your own role in the world... going from being the ""unfortunate sick one"" to the ""workshy state scrounger"" in an afternoon. 

My point is... ATOS aren't perfect, but when it comes to criticism I generally dismiss anything that relates to **what** they do as it seems a necessary evil. I do however have every sympathy for the issues around **how** they do it.

The whole evidence base turns on the question of whether porn is a good analogy for lads' mags, and if so how robust that analogy is. Do you have access to journal subscriptions? I could direct you to a couple of the 'porn as harm' classics I know off the top of my head, and then I presume you could do the legwork to connect the dots yourself. It is a really interesting intersection of theory and statistical evidence, because the robustness of the analogy depends very heavily on the model of 'porn as harm' you use to frame your debate. The real issue is the 'face validity' of an inference from porn to lads mags. All experiments make certain generalisations, and it is the job of the statistician or theorist to separate bad inferences from good. For what it's worth, I think the inference is quite a good one, but I think it isn't quite strong enough to completely convince me from theory alone.

Mann 2008 is the one I recommend you to start with if you're not all that invested. It is a good overview of the problem and evidence base although it is a bit more limited than Hunter 2000 which I think is the most comprehensive. You'll see (particularly in Hunter) that there is good reason to think these harms apply in the case of lad's mags too, but very little direct supportin evidence.

I'd add that simply finding lads' mags were harmful would not constitute sufficient reason to ban them in my view - the harms would have to far outweigh the benefit, for which I simply don't believe the evidence base is strong enough to conclude.

true,EnglishNumpty,cnty-england,England,"&gt;What you're suggesting is that the police should use violence and intimidation to prevent crimes.

No, that's blatantly not what I'm saying and you bloody well know it. Stop misrepresenting what I've said.

I'm saying that police should use fair and proportionate violence against people who themselves are violent. Once you start spitting at people everyone should have the right to knock your teeth out. That would be fair and proportionate.

Spitting can transmit HIV and hepatitis, so it should be treated harshly on the spot to stop any further spitting from happening.

Just out of interest, do you also believe that defending your property with force should be illegal? Do you think people who shoot burglars are criminals?

&gt;Also, I think when someone is arrested for claiming sex outside of marriage and homosexually are immoral, it isn't due to political correctness, it is due to hate speech. 

No, it's in the bible. Political correctness has become so bad in this country that the state religion is now considered ""hate"" by the police and leftists like you.

I've heard some people, mostly homosexuals and university aged leftists, claim that being against homosexual acts is ""hate"". But you're the first person to ever bring sex outside of marriage into the same fold.

Do you really think that he should have been arrested for his beliefs?

If so, I'd argue that he was key for both of those reasons.

Much like Mata being key for chelsea last term, the best player (arguably) and the main focal point of the attack, and the stats support this.

It's hard to say though. I wouldn't suggest that Siggy in the #10 role is key for us, however I would say that Dembele in the 4-2-3-1 was last season. Key in pushing the team forward.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; I'm saying that police should use fair and proportionate violence against people who themselves are violent.

But how do we decide what is fair and appropriate. You said the police should stop doing things by the book, so should it be up to individual officers what level of force is necessary? How do we know they wouldn't do above and beyond in order to get revenge (like with the officer in this news story).

Yes, spitting is disgusting, nobody is disputing that. What people are saying is that it shouldn't be OK for a police officer to beat the shit out of someone because they spat at them. We have courts and a legal system for a reason. Spitting, as well as any other violent or unhelpful action, will be taken into account and possibly end up in court. We don't need police officers also taking out their own personal justice for it.

&gt;Just out of interest, do you also believe that defending your property with force should be illegal?

No. I believe that a police officer should act within the law at all times, and not take the law into their own hands. These are completely different situations you are talking about.

&gt;No, it's in the bible.

Oh, that's alright then. Just because it is in a book that is really old it should be completely fine, right? Moral beliefs have changed in the last 2000 years. It is now acceptable to be gay. It is acceptable to be of another religion. It is acceptable for a woman to not be owned by her husband or parents. Just because it says so in the bible, it doesn't make it OK to preach. 

&gt;Political correctness has become so bad in this country that the state religion is now considered ""hate"" by the police and leftists like you.

Yes, it is considered hate when you are saying a large group of people are immoral because a book that is around 2000+ years old says so.

&gt;Do you really think that he should have been arrested for his beliefs? 

It depends what the beliefs are. If I went out onto the street and said that all black people were immoral, and shouldn't be allowed in the country, and shouldn't be allowed to marry white people, would you think that was OK? Saying gay people, and people who have sex outside of marriage is as unacceptable in my book as racism.

I think a key thing to keep in mind throughout this debate is that it is almost unquestionable in my mind that the kind of culture which produces things like Nuts is much better for women than overtly repressive regimes, but that doesn't automatically imply that Nuts is good (or even 'not harmful') for women.

So for example say you agree with theorists who say all rape is about power over an out-group. You'd say something like 'Although it is clear women in India - who face an intersection of caste and gender - have it much worse than Western women in terms of the threat of sexual violence, Nuts (which promotes a view of women as something to sandwich in between gadgets and cars) contributes to the problem of sexual violence against women in the West, even though at the same time Nuts could only exist in a culture where caste was not a defining feature'

Just to be clear. That's not my actual opinion and it is a bit rough around the edges to demonstrate a point; your explanation for the (very interesting) phenomenon you describe depends a little bit in your theory about gender relations.

Who knows.

As far as the media goes, what we can all agree on is the fact that Gareth's agent is a bit of a cock. He's the one who's been pushing for the move, as he'll get 10% of the fee (will set him for life!). He's been feeding the media with bullshit and rumours, but there's still some truth to it I'm sure.

I don't think, however, that anything is more disrespectful to the club than what he did today: a). not turning up to training -  he's still under contract. It's entirely justified that we should fine him. And b). *allegedly* saying he still loves the fans and the club and is grateful.

Where I am grateful for him not trying to force a move, leaving the power in levy's hands, he's now *reportedly* angered, upset, furious... he's not turned up for training and is now really showing that he wants to make the move.

&gt; You go and get some lunch at Mcdonalds, you don't care that the minimum wage oik behind the counter has feelings, you just want this food serving object to give you some cheap food, you disgust me.

Do you have trouble understanding the concept of objectification? It's not too hard. When you go to get a car fixed, or get some food, you will assess them on their ability to do their job.

Objectification is thinking a women's job *is to look sexy*, even when it's not. An equivalent analogy to yours would be getting your car fixed, and instead of assessing the mechanic as a car-fixing tool, assessing her as an oiled-up busty *female* mechanic who secretly wants to fuck you.

It comes back to the link between feminism and socialism. Where there is an exchange of money, one of the parties is providing a service to another party, and therefore is approaching the transaction from a position of inferiority. Or that's the idea. Therefore anything from the porn industry to the lad's mag industry to the modeling industry, where women are objectifying their bodies *and getting paid for it*, they are not necessarily doing it for fun or their own pleasure, and never truly would be unless they weren't getting paid (or promoted in order to be paid).

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"The whole cash-exchange thing opens up an entire barrel of worms. IMO exchange of cash doesn't mean one party is 'lesser' than the other. Cash is just convenient. 

Sex is one of the best things about being human. It's great as a lovey-dovey couple, it's great as a one night stand. It's great by yourself, it's great as a group. The more we as a society move toward a sex-positive culture the better it will be for everyone.

Sex-positive means recognising that sex is multi-faceted. It's a mechanical act for reproducing, it's a way for couples to intimately bond, it's physiologically and psychologically exciting act, and it's a million other things.

Some womens bodies are more valuable than others. I value my partner's body more than any other. When initially dating, I found her body more attractive than others. Some people have kinks for all sorts of bodies, and that's how the world is. Unfortunately, some people are born ugly and there's nothing can be done to make people find them physically attractive. Those are the breaks.

If you exclude society's pervasive negative spin on sex, then what's different between a glamour model selling photographs of her body or filming herself doing sex acts, and someone offering their physical labour (for cash) to haul a piano up the stairs?

Do you really not see the problem with beginning the process of assessments with the preconceived intention of reducing the number of claimants? Doing anything but considering each claim on an individual basis is the definition of unreasonableness.

Problems you will have to deal with: 

1. Driving on the other side of the road (obviously)
2. You can't turn left (right in US) when the lights are red. 
3. Very busy 3 lane roundabouts where in order to exit where you want you will have to change lanes on the roundabout. 
4. Roads in London are generally quite narrow so you need to be aware of the lack of space and parked cars will regularly pull out into your lane.  
5. You will experience junctions with no lights, where, because of how much traffic there is the only way to turn onto the road is to push your way in. Otherwise you will end up sitting forever waiting for a gap in the traffic. 

There's probably other differences but I've only been to the US a couple of times so I'm not an expert.

I know I've made this sound worse than it is but thankfully due to how slow traffic moves in London, your worst case scenario is a 10mph crash where the only casualty is your bumper (I know you call this something else but I can't remember what it is).

Honestly though, this is such a stupid cirlcejerk. Spurs and LFC are both in a similar position right now, whether we like it or not.

My intuition is that the best way to check specifically for the question you want answering is to look at all cases where sexual violence has fallen dramatically (anywhere in the world) and seeing if that correlates to an increase in porn watching or lads' mag purchases. If you don't see a correlation, that at least rules out the connection as spurious, but if you DO you'd have a major headache trying to prove causality one way or another.

A good place to start is to look at the classic SES markers - look at whether the decrease in sexual assaults is also correlated with rising income equality or increased job security. Both of these things are strong,y correlated with just about every positive effect you could imagine, so it is perfectly plausible to investigate the hypothesis that, 'When men's incomes go up they spend more money on luxuries (like lads' mags) and feel that they have more to lose by being convicted of rape'. Or similarly, 'When incomes rise, people demand more police officers on their streets and make more 'impulse' purchases like lads' mags'. I don't know if this is true or not, but I would be REALLY surprised if SES doesn't have some causal effect on both sexual violence and porn consumption.

true,Legitfront,null,null,"A 4-3-3 is different  from a 4-2-3-1.

I think it's Mourinhos prefered system, he only really played with a 4-2-3-1 in RM and that was because he had Xabi Alonso in his team and no really Defensive mid-fielder. He ended up playing Pepe and then getting Essein.

A 4-3-3 needs a fulltime defensive midfielder, a box to box central midfielder and then a creative midfielder. The creative and Box to box midfielder play next to each other in front of the DMF. It's a good system because the midfield triangle can change when in and out of possesion. The problem is that this system requires players with specific abilities and responsabilities.

The 4-2-3-1 is a more forgiving system. The double pivot make it a more defensive system depending on the players. RM had no real DMF, worst Xabi was a deeplying midfielder and not a very good defensive one, (think about Pirlo).

Right now Mourinho has to mold the team around Lampard at least these few first games, to get the team into that winning mentallity and confidence. Lampard may be getting old but he still leads.
This is forcing Mou to use a 4-2-3-1 Lampard can't play in a 4-3-3, he doesnt have the pace and lung to to box to box anymore. Van Ginkel looks like a great DMF who can also pass, (a Pirlo maybe?)

I really can't wait for midseason or the end, I think Chelsea will be playing a 4-3-3 with, a midfield triangle of Van Ginkel as DMF, Oscar as box to box (yes it's a bit of waste of his talents but the kid defends) and Mata as creative midfielder. That doesn't mean that the wingers, Hazard, Schurrle, Bruyen and William won't be rotating with oscar and Mata.

Will be hard not to directly compare the pair's progress simply because of their similarities in position, style and of course, their nice round year's gap in age. It's too early to be sure which of the two will go on to better things, but I believe both of them will be integral parts of our attack for years to come.

From the few matches so far this season, it seems Raheem is much stronger than he was last year. He always had bags of confidence but I feel he needs to work on his final product a bit more. Hopefully his goal yesterday was a good springboard for him.

I would also say though that our track record of late isn't the best of liberating and freeing populations. Based on previous evidence alone I would be seriously concerned that we would compound the situation and do more harm than good.

As for 'none of our business' - there is, perhaps, some truth in that. Disposing the Syrian regime is no guarantee to peace - it's very likely to end in civil war that ends in another Mugabe taking control. Being responsible for that will hurt everyone involved and increase hostilities towards the Western world. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't AlQuaida's main aggravation with the West the fact that we won't leave the Middle East alone?

(I should add I only mention America because they are our partners in these wars / liberations and if we support them then we must also shoulder our share of responsibility for their actions).

true,knockturnal,mccoy,McCoy,"Here's the first 8 of my 11 episode list that I'll be watching the week before the 50th. 

The Romans

I think this episode fleshes out the First Doctor better than any other. He's a lot more adventurous and fun-loving than you see in most episodes. You get to see him get in a fist fight. You get to see him pretend to be a famous harpist. You get to see him goof off with Nero. Really, it's so much fun and you get to see far more than the ""grumpy"" Doctor.

Tomb of the Cybermen

One of Two's best. Not only is it likely the best Cybermen episode of all time, the Second Doctor really shows off one of his favorite tricks - feigning stupidity to manipulate everyone around him. Also, it features Jamie, who is definitely one of the best Classic companions.

Inferno

We often think of the Third Doctor as a time-traveling James Bond, and this episode exemplifies it. One of the first times they really played around with time travel - the parallel universe plot was done very well and made it much deeper and more emotional.

City of Death

This episode is both incredibly interesting in terms of its use of time travel as well as delightfully campy. It combines a lot of the best elements from the Fourth Doctor's run and has another great companion, Romana II. 

Enlightenment

Enlightenment is a wonderfully paced sci-fi epic. It can be a little difficult to watch in vacuum because it is part of a larger Black Guardian arc, but all you need to know is that the Black Guardian is trying to force Turlough to kill the Doctor and everything else moves pretty well from there. It combines the Fifth Doctor's youthful bravery and humanity very well while putting him up against the most powerful being in the universe - you almost don't even notice how much of an epic battle it is, because the Doctor goes about it so well. 

Vengeance on Varos

My favorite Sixth Doctor episode, it explores some of the darker aspects of society. It's well-paced, the Sixth Doctor really shines, and it's one of the best examples of Doctor Who's most common device - using peripheral characters for comedic critique and narration.

Remembrance of the Daleks

One of the best battles between the Doctor and the Daleks, it really illustrates his hatred for them and is a great preface of the Time War.

My mother has a very specific condition in her leg which means she has near debilitating pain at times. Limited mobility and has been told flat out it won't get better, all they can do is have her open wound dressed by a nurse 1/2 times a week and manage her pain through morphine etc etc.

Cue ATOS declaring her fit to work, despite a letter from her GP supporting her inability to work in spite of attempts to work part time and volunteer over time. On appeal it turns out the assessor didn't even look at her medical records / letters from NHS staff. On review the decision was obviously over turned.
Despite this ATOS left her hanging for weeks and were apparently reluctant to give her a straight answer. Eventually she called and had a woman who was incredibly rude like she was somehow in the wrong for enquiring into what decision was made. Instead of giving a straight answer she said to quote ""well you got what you wanted didn't you?"" in a rude tone and ended the call.
All in all rather than the efficient process they were supposed to provide they put a huge amount of financial and mental stress on an already vulnerable woman and then acted as if she was the one in the wrong. Obviously not disputing the need for continuous assessment in many cases or proposing that EVERY staff member and case goes like this but it's far from the only negative feedback ATOS have had..",0,1377731594,null,0,false,0,cbxavp4,t3_1l9vn4,t1_cbxavp4,t1_cbx95cq,null,1429666225,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

After about an hour you'll be fine (I mean really, if you've got your eyes open you're not going to go down the wrong side of the road!), you will find things like the lack of stoplights and overall more hectic nature of the roads will take more getting used to and you'll probably piss a few people off with driving slowly while you get used to things but you really shouldn't worry about it, get complex roundabouts out of the way early, they're about as bad as anything gets, you'll find you're checking your blindspots a lot more than you would in the US, oh and no one really uses cruise control, so you get a lot of people on motorways changing speed erratically.

Having a passenger who pays attention is the main thing that helps (for pointing out directions etc.) so the driver can just concentrate on driving for the first day at least. 

Have you driven on mainland Europe? If you have, you will have no problems at all driving in the UK. 

Personally, I'd drive, train is great, but driving will be more flexible, all the cities you've mentioned have park and ride schemes where you can part on the outskirts and then get a bus in, usually it £5 for a day or something the locations should be in the GPS but look up the postcodes before to be safe. This is a far better idea than driving into cities and you can visit some old villages in the cotswolds and stuff on the way. They're impossible to see by train, but totally worth it. Cost wise, it'll end up about the same either way.

Speed cameras are signposted. Most construction on motorways is accompanied by 50mph average speed cameras. If you stick to 80-85 mph on motorways you'll be fine. If you are caught speeding, then they won't stop you (unless you're going &gt;120mph) they'll just send a ticket to the rental company who will then forward the fine to you within 2 weeks. If you plan on returning to the UK ever again you should pay it, if you don't, don't! I wouldn't worry about it on motorways too much though, its just A roads and in towns (where you shouldn't be speeding anyway) that you need to worry about. 

Oh and there are lots of places where speed cameras are signposted but there are no speed cameras the locals know this (i.e. M4 between Swindon and Chippenham, you'll probably pass it on your route, [See this sign](https://www.google.ca/maps/preview#!q=chippenham&amp;data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d-1.817689!3d51.539874!2m2!1f100.58!2f89.29!4f75!2m4!1e1!2m2!1sReYddQW-_th2t45Kn-6IeA!2e0!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d29007855!2d-97.15369!3d49.891235!3m2!1i1867!2i1058!4f13.1&amp;fid=5) those mean nothing), just drive at the speed of the traffic around you.

Fact: When Direct Rule was implemented in 1972 the Secretary of State was advised that it would be ""improper"" for the flag to continue to be flown, as technically it was an armorial banner derived from the corporate arms granted to the Northern Ireland parliament, and thus a symbol of that institution rather than of the country.  Ask the NIO or the NI Assembly yourself. 

The guidance from Westminster in that link refers to ALL government buildings (which includes places like tax and welfare offices, etc.) - not just ""Parliament Buildings"" at Stormont - the terms are distinct.  

And it cannot be clearer: The Ulster flag and the Cross of St. Patrick have no official status and under the Flags Regulations are not permitted to be flown from Government Buildings.

This comes from a House of Commons debate from 2007 when Andrew Rosindell asked the Secretary of State, Peter Hain, about the Government's use of the old Northern Ireland and the St. Patrick's Cross:

Northern Ireland Executive: Flags

Andrew Rosindell MP: To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the Government’s policy is on the use of (a) the Ulster flag, (b) the Cross of St. Patrick, (c) the Union flag, (d) the European Union flag and (e) the Irish Republic flag on government buildings in Northern Ireland. [135038]

Mr. Hain MP: The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 regulates the flying of the Union flag from Government buildings on specified days in Northern Ireland. It also permits the European flag to be flown, in conjunction with the Union Flag, on Europe Day at Government buildings that have more than one flagpole. Under the Regulations the flag of the Republic of Ireland could be flown, alongside the Union flag, from a Government building on the occasion of a visit of the Head of State of the Republic of Ireland to that building, provided that the building had more than one flag pole and that the Union flag was flown in prominence. The Ulster flag and the Cross of St. Patrick have no official status and under the Flags Regulations are not permitted to be flown from government buildings.

Unless you are suggesting that Peter Hain, the then Secretary of State, misled or lied to Parliament? That would have been a very serious matter for him, and if so why did none of the Northern Ireland unionist MPs challenge him?

It surely does matter when we cannot fly a regional flag which everyone recognises and can be flown in a similar manner to the English, Welsh and Scottish regional flags?

Many institutions carry on to fly the design in lieu of anything else, that's admirable but it doesn't make it recognised. I would be keen to see this coin you refer to, certainly the only Northern Ireland symbol I have ever seen is the flax-flower emblem. Labeling everyone who disagrees with you or pointing out the actual facts as a ""naive ""liberal"" fool and acting as little more than a mere pawn in the Republican game of attacking everything Northern Ireland"" simply serves to produce incredulity rather than sympathy.

If I had to chose sources as to which are more reliable, yours or the British Government's, I know which one I would chose.  If that, in your eyes, makes me some sort of ""republican pawn"" I am happy to be so and will continue to call for the reintroduction of an official regional Northern Ireland flag that can be flown across our Province!",0,1377732164,null,0,1377770717,0,cbxb2rd,t3_1kr4to,t1_cbxb2rd,t1_cbu074v,null,1429666133,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Basically, 7 doesn't shirk from what he knows he has to do. He doesn't compromise his ethics (He always gives people a chance) but doesn't whinge and struggle while handing his enemies enough rope to hang themselves.

OK. First things first. Your order with the other company won't make much difference, as they can't do shit anyway without the MAC.

You locked the account. That's not the fault of EE, that's your fault. You can get your dad to verify first and then get him to pass the phone to you. As EE discovered that you're not the account holder while trying to access the account, they need to now verify that the owner is still in control of the account. Saying ""he's in the house"" could mean anything. You've raised their suspicions, they need to be vigilant. If they allowed you to continue, they'd be breaking the law. Not only would EE be liable for fines, the person you're talking to can be liable. This is shitty for them and I don't think you would take that risk either, so cut them some slack.

You are correct. Requesting a MAC takes a maximum of 5 working days. This is part of the regulations that EE need to follow. If they don't follow regs, you can contact OFCOM who **will** get it sorted for you.

However, there are acceptable reasons why EE may not have been able to provide the MAC. For instance, if the exchange is being upgraded, this can sometimes lock MAC generation for customers on that exchange. Other issues include BT system faults, etc. MAC's are not generated by EE. They're generated by BT. All MAC management is done via BT. If there's an issue, sometimes it's out of EE's control. This may be the case and can happen with any provider that relies on the system. When it comes to MAC's and migration, they ALL rely on BT.

It's possible your MAC has been generated and EE have attempted to send it (does your dad use his EE Email address?). It's possible that an internal oversight has meant it's been generated but not sent. So it's probably sitting there waiting for you to collect.

Here are my suggestions:

1) Get your dad to get the account unlocked. It was stupid to try and pass off as your dad. EE have to abide by DPA regs as much as the MAC provision regs. That's not EE's fault. That's yours.

2) Check your EE Email address, it may be there for you to collect.

3) When your account is unlocked, call them (get your dad to verify first) and explain that you've had a MAC generated and you'd like to collect it. If you just say ""I want my MAC"" they may misunderstand and generate you a new one. They're not psychic (nor do they automatically read every note on your account as this would dramatically increase call times), so just explain what you need and that you should've had one generated already. This will speed up your call.

4) If your code hasn't been generated. Remain calm. There are people that are bad at their job everywhere. The person that you're NOW speaking to is probably better. Explain that you've already requested it over 5 working days ago and they might be able to get you one instantly. Don't blame them if they can't, they can't do much about it.

5) If you don't receive it automatically, just call after the 5 days to collect it. Don't be irate with the guy on the other end, he's just there to help and they'll be much more inclined to deal with your issue if you treat them like a human, because they're not robots.

6) If you don't get it within this time, Email OFCOM. Then, call EE and tell them that you've done so.

If you want any advice, let me know. I'm an ex broadband engineer and I also used to work for EE in a department that dealt with broadband registration / provisioning faults.

from /u/lolkac (formatted)



&gt;If you look only at U18 level, there is lot of players that can break thru. But i think the best are..
&gt;
&gt;**Pedro chirivella**: New signing from Spain.Young 16 years old midfielder. He plays like Xabi. According to people in Spain one of the best talents in the world
&gt;
&gt;**Jordan Rossiter**: 16 years old midfield player. Currently playing for U21
&gt;
&gt;**Jerome Sinclair**:16? years old striker. He is the youngest ever player to have played for Liverpool.
&gt;
&gt;**Sergi Canos**:New signing from Barca. Very highly rated. He can play everywhere in the front. But i think he will be n10
&gt;
&gt;**Harry Wilson**: Dont know how old is he. 16 I think. People are saying that he is one of the best in U18 but i didnt saw him too much. Maybe this season he can show me how good he is.
&gt;
&gt;**Oluwaseyi Ojo**: My favorite player! He is like Ibe and Sterling. Hope he can be as good as them
&gt;
&gt;All players above have great potential but it doesnt mean anything. They need to work hard. Every one of &gt;them can play in future for top clubs. But its on them.

O2 have in the past fallen foul of Ofcom for not meeting coverage targets, and Vodafone just appears to be doing the bare minimum to avoid being told off. The end result is that you only seem to get a 3G signal if you're in a town or city, nowhere else.

 How can we best work in partnership with CQC and the new Chief Inspector role whose inspections and ratings regime is designed to improve transparency?

How do we go further in publishing – and getting practices to publish – an increasing range of comparative public information?

  

 How can we best work in partnership with CQC and the new Chief Inspector role whose inspections and ratings regime is designed to improve transparency?

  

 How do we stimulate new forms of patient involvement and insight, including introducing the Friends and Family Test in general practice?

  

 How best do we roll out new models of patient choice?

1) Mandatory regulation. As is the case in both the private and public sector industries of all shades the approach to data release is one of begrudging acceptance at best. It requires time and often funding. This data, however should not represent the basis of any sort of 'league table' as with schools - the result would be a loss of confidence in the GP service which particularly in access-restricted regions could be particularly damaging to seekers of assistance. It could be invaluable in terms of internal review and audit.

2)  The CQC is fit for purpose with regards GP care. Potentially only a condition for data release should be considered, should it be regarded a regulatory requirement. 

3) The Friends and Family Test is flawed in acute care, and would be notably moreso in the scope of GP practise. The expectation of the public is that their GP will 'make them better' though it may not be feasible, reasonable or wise to treat at root cause or symptomatically from a medical perspective. The impression that 'nothing is being done' is difficult to countenance in acute care, but frequently in general practise that is just the thing required.

# 4) The current scope of patient choice models are sufficient. Otherwise, advice and materials available from GP, walk-in, and minor injuries treatment centres.  


 How can we best stimulate and create space for clinically-led innovation?

  

 How can we challenge and support local health communities, including CCGs and health and wellbeing boards, to develop more stretching ambitions for primary care?

  

 How do we best support integration pioneers in testing new ways of commissioning and contracting for integrated primary care and community services for people with physical and mental health conditions?

  

 How can we best mobilise existing improvement resource (e.g. NHS IQ) and facilitate access to other potential external support for primary care transformation?
 

1) Active and proactive engagement through professional Colleges, registering bodies, and unions. Talk to the people on the ground, and accept input from healthcare workers at every level. 

2) Expansion of the role of community nurses and paramedics, lobbying for greater access to community focus in the training of those professions and referral pathways to a GP, perhaps under GP/Public health Consultant oversight within a Community Trust. Many people requesting an out of hours service will not require the attention of a doctor at the point of care. 

3) Encourage and incentivise the employment of registered psychologists and mental health nurses in community settings. GPs are not and cannot be specialists in every field, and mental health in particular is an aspect of healthcare requiring nuance and familiarity. Similarly, consideration of suitably qualified physiologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists in the management of established and long-term conditions to relieve the GP burden and retain a continuity of appropriate care. 

#4) NHS IQ is meaningless to actual patient care except as an examination of the totality of NHS England. Seek to establish NHS review 'regions' in line with a recognition of the differing healthcare needs of disparate populations. 


 How might we develop QOF so that that we preserve its essential features but create more flexibility for practices and reduce the feel of a tick-box culture?

  

 How can we get best value from enhanced services and reduce process-oriented measures?

  

 How should general practice IT systems develop to support more efficient and integrated working?

  

 How can we help improve the productivity of practice systems and processes, for example through the Productive General Practice programme?

  

 How can we help ensure that practices are making most effective use of all practice staff, including practice nurses and practice managers?

  

 How do we engage practice managers more effectively?

1) Don't. It's fit for general purposes. If development is required, it is in allowing recognition of the exceptional. Simply providing the sensation (or reality) of an 'other' response should be sufficient. 

2) This question is simply meaningless without further context. 

3) Ensuring good use of the ID number system is invaluable. 

4) Collaboration between community teams and professionals referred to earlier.

5) As above.

#6) Again, broadly meaningless without defined aims.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Here's the thing (and i stand by my hating myself for this stance of a few days ago)....on deadline day if his price is viable Leandro fucking Damiao isn't a bad choice....

He's 24 which is younger than anyone we have. He has some upside. He is a hold up style striker who can poach which makes him something different than we have.

Inter tried to hold us hostage last year because we were desperate to find a front line striker.  They clearly believed that Damiao would get offers from some of the big teams (i think at one point they even mentioned Real and Chelsea) problem is none of the ""big boys"" ever came calling.  Southampton made an offer and LfD wanted a ""bigger team"", so they went and got Osvaldo. In the summer they seem to have thrown their hopes into Napoli who seem to have completely lost any interest in him.  

That leaves us and a market for Leandro fucking Damiao that is rapidly drying up.  Now would be the time to make a cheeky bid and see if we could grab him.

I feel dirty having said that.

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"Well that's made me confident about my ATOS assessment I'm due at tomorrow...

I wasn't best convinced they knew what they were doing when they sent directions that involved walking journeys worthy of marathon training in times only a sprinter could achieve (I have mobility problems).

My first appointment was at 11 am, I explained that there wasn't a hope in hell I'd be able to travel the distance to be able to make that time (it's in another town, not even my closest. I live in the country) and the best I could hope to realistically arrive would be mid to late afternoon.

They said fine, no problem. The next appointment was for 9:15 am...


**Edit:** It was my son who wrote this. He's 43 and hasn't been able to work since he was badly wounded in the 1991 Iraq war. He has neurological problems which gives him chronic pain and very limited movement and because most of his injuries are neurological, there isn't anything physical to see. If you saw him, you wouldn't necessarily think anything was wrong, until he moved.

Because if this, it is always very difficult to explain to people how this affects him. Whenever a new government tries to please the Daily Mail readers by clamping down on benefit fraud (while spending huge sums on engineering projects like the new high speed rail, wars and of course huge payouts to banks), he has to go through the wringer time and again. Nearly every time we have to go to an appeals process. I expect this time will be no different.

He stayed with his mother and I yesterday because we are much closer to Atos than his house and even then he'll just make his 3.30 appointment. He's being driven in case any of you think I'm a monster and making him walk. ;) It's just that it takes him a considerable time to get himself together mentally for any kind of journey, as you might imagine if any of you have chronic pain.

After his interview, he'll be going straight home, which is in the opposite direction so it would make no sense to come back here, but I'll try to remember to update you when I find out more. I hope you'll understand that reddit won't be first in my thoughts at this time.

true,fractorial,present,,"According to The Guardian, Eto'o will sign for Chelsea after all on a 12 month deal worth around £4m per year. That would put him around £80,000 per week, a drastic cut from the nearly £300,000 he was earning at Anzhi, and a fair bit less than the £140,000 per week reported by the Daily Mail, [who are also confirming his signing.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2404952/Chelsea-sign-Samuel-Etoo-7million-year-deal.html)

Also from The Guardian piece:
&gt;Juan Mata will not be allowed to leave, with Chelsea insistent that the Spain international's future lies at Stamford Bridge despite Arsène Wenger's claim earlier this week that the playmaker was ""on the market"".

&gt;Mata, who is still working on gaining match fitness following a pre-season that started late after the Confederations Cup, has played a bit-part role under Mourinho and his father and agent, Juan Sr, was a guest in the Arsenal directors' box at Tuesday's Champions League qualifier against Fenerbahce.

&gt;But, while his chances have been limited to date, Chelsea are intent on retaining their two-times player of the year and will resist any interest expressed in his services before the deadline. Mata, too, is understood to be keen to remain at the club and regain his place in the first-team.

true,Lostraveller,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I have some personal favorites from the episodes I've seen (Mostly T. Baker) but I would rather do it by Doctor, and why: 


1: The Chase.
 
The reason for this episode making the list is because it really does show the roots of Doctor Who as an educational show, is the second appearence of the Daleks, and features Frankenstein destroying a Dalek.


2: The War Games:

Admittedly I haven't seen it, however it does feature the first appearence of the Time Lords, so it certainly is iconic. (I have only seen two second Doctor Episodes, both were meh.)


3: Death to the Daleks

It features the Doctor teaming up with his oldest enemies. I put this in over The Master's first appearance due to having not seen it. *Terror of the Autons* if you want to look it up though.



4: The Deadly Assasin/Invasion of Time

I've watched more T. Baker than other old series Doctors together. These two really are creme de la creme of his episodes. Both of which take place on Gallifrey.


5:Enlightenment

It features the Doctor matching wits with a bunch of gods participating in a race against each other. They can also read minds.


6: Trial of a Timelord

I had to. It is an entire season of the Doctor being forced to fight the ultimate enemy. I have not seen that season, but want to.


7:Battlefield

The doctor is going up against Morgan le Fay, Mordred, and has to find excalibur. It is also the last appearance of Nicholas Courtney (The Brigadier) in Doctor Who proper.


8: Doctor Who the movie.

It is bad, but at some parts enjoyable. The Doctor also has amnesia for a while. 


Honorable Mentions:


The Three Doctors

I felt it was unfair to include it. Look at the title.


The Five Doctors

Same here


The TWO Doctors

I am not sure how well known this episode is. 2&amp;6. Haven't seen it.


Genisis of the Daleks

Not as good as T. Baker's adventures on Gallifrey, but awesome nonetheless.

 Should we seek to develop a joint concordat with key partners that re-affirms and refreshes the core features of general practice?

  

 How can we put general practice at the heart of more integrated out-of-hospital services and give GPs and practices greater responsibility for coordinating care for patients?

  

 How should we define high quality general practice and their responsibilities/ accountabilities, through the GP contract?

  

 How do we create synergy with the new system of CQC ratings and inspections to create a clearer sense of what patients can expect from good general practice?

1) No. It's not needed. GPs are aware of their scope, as are most of the public. 

2) See prior responses re: involvement of Nursing and Allied Health professions. 

3) No, through internal audit and review alongside the CQC. This is particularly vital if the Friends and Family Test is applied (which I reiterate it should not be). High quality in perception and reality differ and should be regarded from the professional rather than emotive perspective.

#4) Publish the criteria in an easily accessible location in simple, clear and meaningful language. Avoid words like 'synergy' as you would the plague.   

How far should we create stronger incentives for both inter-practice collaboration and collaboration with other primary care providers, acute, community and social care services?

  

 How can we better stimulate and recognise/reward quality of care for people with co-morbidities and complex health and care problems?

  

 How far should we seek to reward practices for wider outcomes, such as enhancing quality of care for long term conditions and reducing avoidable emergency admissions, or reducing incidence of strokes and heart attacks, or improving patient experience of integrated care?

  

 What is the potential future role for PMS and APMS contracts in stimulating innovative approaches or helping address particular local challenges?

1) Require them. Establish them as the default state of practice. 

2) Internal audit and review, alongside the CQC. Possibly a broad ranking system which is NOT innumerated in the form of a league table, but rather a 1-5 scale, or bronze-gold. 

3) Expansion of scope and internal dissemination of information.  With better regulatory adherence comes a permitted capacity to engage further with community care services.

#4) As above. Sub-national oversight in these fields.

It's what happens when you're 18, in the spotlight and earning £1000s a week. I think he seems pretty damn motivated though. Played very well against Notts. 

Also, I've seen him compared to Oxlade-Chamberlain, maybe not here, but by my friends and in the footballing world. Personally I think he has a lot more potential. Ox is good. But he's more brute-force than accuracy and precision. Sterling appears to be faster and more technically gifted.

true,felips,null,null,"You are so close minded in the literal sense. As in, it pains you to see the world interconnected through multiple influences. If you were such a purist of Paella and its Valencian influences, it would pain you to see your beloved dish being interpeted in South American cultures. This DIFFERENT or VARYING interpretation of Paella, in your eyes, with its different ingredients but same overall premises cannot be called paella and must have its own separate title. I personally don't believe our version of Paella to be any lesser than Valencian Paella, but you have to admit that it is OUR (south american) INTERPRETATION of Paella (and I'm not talking about taste or ingredient composition when I speak of versions of Paella, I speak about the actual origin of use of Paella [which the origin of said food can be tracked, just as the origin of the Spanish language can too be tracked] thus it is our INTERPRETATION of paella [and if you don't know the origins of paella, it was a food to be had at feast as celebratory and gather family under]) So, our paella is an interpretation of valencian paella. It is an interpetation, or dialect of paella; just as our version of spanish with slight changes to the original , is in a way an interpretation of the original spanish. One is not lesser or more than the other because at the end of the day, they BOTH are spanish. We can still communicate.  
I'll give you another example in Spanish architecture. When the Moors came to souther Spain and build extremely beauitful architecture, they borrowed many techniques leftover by the Romans. Does that make Moor Mosques any lesser than the Hagia Sophia or Dome of the Rock? No. The moorish architecture is an interpetation of traditional Islamic building *with its seperate influences*. It is still a mosque, and any muslim from any part of the world would not segregate it against the mosques from his home-- he can worship at either place the exact same. Just as a Valencian could be a colonist in 19th century south America ""would go eat a paella with the colonist"" *in the same manner* as he would have with his old family in the Spain.  
Why go on this crusade of classification? A mosque is a mosque, and ""pa-e-ya"" is the same as ""pa-e-ja"". I still don't understand why you wish to label which pronunciations ""are better"" based your uneducated knowledge of said language. There is no ""better"".

&gt;Wahl: You're very close to Mourinho, who wrote the foreword for your autobiography. He's at Chelsea, and they need a center forward in my opinion. Has the thought crossed your mind that maybe they need you?

&gt;Drogba: That's your opinion! (laughs) It's normal. How can I not be close to him? He brought me to Chelsea with Roman Abramovich. I improved and grew up with Chelsea, becoming the player everyone knows now. I hope everyone respects now that this is for me a team that I cannot forget. I will always be linked to Chelsea. For me it's normal. You can't take away from my heart what I did with this club and all the great people I played with.

Also this nice little dig at Arsenal:

&gt; Wahl: I was laughing recently because you scored against Arsenal again in the Emirates Cup preseason tournament. That's now 15 goals against Arsenal in 15 games for you. Why have you had so much success killing Arsenal over the years?

&gt;Drogba: I think it's just there are always teams where you don't know if you'll score, but you always have this belief a bit more than against other teams. Arsenal is one of them, obviously. I've been scoring a lot of goals against them. I still have the feeling, and I know that something maybe can happen that I will create a chance. Even if I don't score I will create chances.",0,1377742330,null,0,false,0,cbxekr1,t3_1lax5m,t1_cbxekr1,t3_1lax5m,null,1429664500,15,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,15

&gt;The Norwegian documentary Bergensbanen details the gorgeous 300-mile, 7.5-hour-long train ride from Bergen to Oslo. An intrepid group of DJs have scored the entire journey, which traverses the frozen region of Finse (a.k.a. Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back).

&gt;Bergensbanen aired last year on Norway's NRK2. The documentary's creators encouraged artists to remix this footage of the Bergen Line, and DJs at the DI.fm forums have scored the entire ride with a pulsing, 7.5-hours DJ mix. The result is hypnotizing. Just project this on a wall, and blammo — instant warehouse party.

When you say ""unethical"" I'm assuming you're implying something along the lines of things being unfair to Spurs due to Roman's advantage in that situation or maybe that what Roman did was ungentlemanly. In terms of fairness, this is pretty much the most common complaint leveled at Chelsea: that Roman uses his money and power to build a better team than Chelsea would otherwise have at the expense of clubs that lack such an involved wealthy owner. I guess this is why some clubs think FFP is the answer. Chelsea would no longer be able to offer such a wage premium and other teams would benefit. 

But put yourself in the position of Hull or Palace. They have a fanbase in England, but what chance do they have to realistically compete with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, etc in terms of revenue, overseas fanbases, European competition money. Pretty much the only thing a team like that can hope for is either a rich owner comes in and levels the playing field or they acquire a 1 in a billion talent like Gareth Bale, which allows them to upgrade the squad once in hopes of making Europe, gaining more TV revenue, and attracting foreign fans. There is no salary cap in the EPL to keep things actually level. I'm sorry to turn this into a rant on FFP, but FFP is just as unfair to smaller clubs as the lack of FFP is to larger clubs without rich owners. And frankly, the bigger clubs can handle the competition. So saying it's a dick move by Roman to swoop in with connections and cash and screw Spurs who have had plenty of great signings this window is objectively ridiculous and only holds up if you're a butthurt Spurs fan, in which case please deal with it.

If, on the other hand, you think that is it unsportsmanlike or ungentlemanly to pulled the rug out from under the Spurs deal, then I'd ask you to please tell me at which point in the transfer process does it become dick for another club to come in and make a better offer? Liverpool had interest and Spurs obviously gave a better offer and better prospects so Willian changed his mind. Can you only get a player without being a dick if you're the second club to attract the player? Is it after the first private meeting with that player's camp? Is it after the medical?

This match'll be all about the midfield. I think we'll pressure them well enough to stop them playing as well as they can, but they'll still give us a real battle.

Not that he would or might, but look at all the managers who have fallen due to bad results.  At this stage a manager who does not deliver glory might have to be sacked by RA just to save face, even if it's Mourinho.  Mourinho knows this and while he also knows that the future lies in our young players, he has no choice but to compromise and secure his future by making every attempt to win enough sliverware over the next couple years to remain at the club for much longer - because I really feel that he wants to stay here for a long long time.

Then again, what do I know..  But if it's true, he's just trying to balance our youth with some experience...  and it's sort of clear he thinks we need a better striker, so he's looking for one, no matter what his age is...  Because his long-term desire to remain with us might be stronger than our youthful ambitions, at least to some degree..  This means a bit of compromise.  And again, if any of this true..

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Yeah, but their last title win was way too recent for us to start saying that. They've only played twice since then and their players have only ""aged"" 3 months since then. They haven't added much/any quality to their side but they haven't lost much either.

And to be fair, having Rooney and Van Persie as their ""only class strikers"" is still a lot to shout about if I were a United fan. There aren't many other teams around with more than 2 class strikers (oil-money clubs aside).

I think it's way too early to tell. They dismantled a strong Swansea side and played well against a Chelsea side most of us have tipped for the title this year. Maybe if they're languishing around 6th or 7th by October people can start seriously doubting their credibility.

Don't get me wrong, I **hate** the fuckers. Nothing would make me happier than to see them never win anything again, but they're not going to just disappear without a trace because old Sad Auld Fuck retired.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Honestly, United could miss CL this year and it wouldn't mean they were on the decline. Teams go through transition, but Utd are the biggest team in English football. In terms of worldwide support they're there with Madrid, Barca, and Bayern. And let's consider what decline means. Does it mean they only win the title every five years or so? Or every three?

When you consider Chelsea and City are on par in terms of spending, there's no reason to assume Utd would win every year. So if they continue to make CL, if they continue to attract the best players in the world, if they continue to be in with a shout for titles, can you call it decline?

I don't think Moyes is Fergie. But I also think he's been handed the keys to Rolls Royce and he's a steady hand.

The reason so many clubs fail after they lose a big manager or after they lose a manager at all is because the next one comes in and decides to turn the club upside down. They remake the club in their image. The smart clubs like Bayern and Barca have essentially stayed at the top because they've brought in coaches who were going to carry on the way of the club. Utd has done the exact same thing. Moyes has no ""philosophy"" that runs counter to what Fergie was doing.

He'll never reach Fergie's status, but I firmly believe Moyes could have a decade at the club. 

As for your comment on transfers...Moyes (and Fergie for that matter) have always been fairly prudent spenders considering the cash on hand. Unlike City, who buy players like flashy cars, Utd have their targets and are content if they can't get them right away. 

I've only seen them this season against Chelsea, arguably a poor performance, and they look as assured as ever. 

In many ways I see Utd much like us this season, albeit at a higher level of play. Because we haven't spent a lot of money, there's the assumption we're ""falling behind"". But fans who think like that always put a premium on new signings. They assume players will live up to their billing.

So what you get is a lot of overrated new signings and a lot of underrated players who've been at clubs for years. I honestly think Liverpool (and the same goes for Utd) have a lot of top class players, but their contributions have become so expected that we begin to undervalue them. 

Anyways...Utd will be fine. They were smart to appoint Moyes and I can't imagine their board having a knee jerk response to a 3rd place finish if it came this year.",0,1377754253,null,0,false,0,cbxiel6,t3_1lb8vf,t1_cbxiel6,t3_1lb8vf,null,1429662642,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

As the poster said, these communities emerged during violent civil conflicts with multiple groups of combatants.  They emerged at times when the State was weak or regionally absent. The State has historically been far more aggressive in reacting to libertarian uprisings and enclaves than towards any other ideologies' - in the case of Spain, for example, it took a concerted joint effort between reactionary forces of both left and right (fascists and Stalinists), with the complicity of much of the capitalist West, to finally crush anarchist Catalonia.  States fear anarchism, because [it actually works](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works) well and provides a terrifying example (for them) to others that people can do without them.  The truth is that most of human relations are conducted anarchistically, and human societies vary in the degree to which they allow or encourage people to do so.

&gt;the Catholic Church came under attack throughout the region...Thousands of members of the Catholic clergy were killed and tortured

I hate this too, but... Do remember the Catholic church was hated by progressives in Spain and had been for decades if not centuries.  It had been exceptionally abusive and murderous over this time.  In most cases, it sided with the fascists who killed hundreds of thousands of people during and after the war, which puts the anarchist killings into context.  Not to mention there was no policy of extermination by the CNT or any other anarchist group, these were mostly individual acts of vengeance against people who had killed family members or were known for particular acts of abuse.  I presume the above is from Bryan Caplan's Anarcho Statists of Spain.  Caplan is a notoriously disingenuous ancap whose histories are highly slanted and have mostly been [debunked](http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/spain/sp001532.html).

&gt;Also the whole no laws, personal justice based on someone's persevered political values and the fact that the workers' couldn't manage themselves because they had no idea about economics and had to be managed by the trade unions. 

Again, I'm guessing this is from Caplan.  I've read some excellent and more neutral histories of Catalonia's experience of anarchism, and some sympathetic ones, and that's not at all the impression it gives me.  There are some great documentaries, or even George Orwell's account in Homage To Catalonia.

&gt;Kronstadt rebellion lasted 10 days and really can't be used as evidence, it can't be claimed to be a success or failure in that time.

Mistake to not play him against Man U. Perhaps. Could they have won without him, yes. Why Jose didn't choose him? Fitness, preferred Oscar's style of play against Man U (and de bruyne would be better defensively) or maybe he wanted to test the young players he choose on their resolve when their talisman is not on the pitch. Mata won the game last year for us. Jose choose not to start him. So if you are in the shoes of schurrle, de bruyne or Oscar during that game. You have to be thinking ""I need to put up a good show today and prove a point. I'm as good as Mata."" That game really tested the ability of some players and it's useful especially when we loads of big games in the champions league.

true,The_Disco_Spider_,null,null,"Realistically we're competing for 4th/5th meaning our competition will be Arsenal and Spurs, compare our transactions to those 2 and it's very different outlook.

Spurs have bought top quality all over the park but have lost their match winning superstar. They struggled to beat mid-table and relegation threatened sides last year but Bale bailed them out. They're struggling so far against the same sides and they've needed penalties to win. Even when Lamela joins they'll miss Bale. Also they will need a settling in period, 5 of their front 6 will likely be new faces.

Arsenal have signed a young forward and might add flamini and Cabaye to an already quality midfield. When they only play 3 in the middle I struggle to see how they'll keep Ramsey, Wilshere, Arteta, Diaby, Flamini, Cabaye, and Cazorla all happy and playing frequently enough.

To wrap up, Tottenham have done better than us and we've done better than Arsenal. Tottenham finish ahead of us and we finish ahead of Arsenal.
Jumping up two PL spots and getting Europa league is a good stepping stone to the CL.

______

When it comes to our transfers I don't think you should worry, Rogers has things planned and will likely bring in 1 or 2 new faces. You don't want an impulse buy who doesn't fit. Plus, 5/6 days is enough time to get transfers done, think how many are started and finished on deadline day.

EDIT: We finished 12 points behind Arsenal last year and this time round we have Coutinho and Sturridge for a full season. Aspas will add goals and depth. Also Mignolet, who so far looks better than a mistake ridden Reina. Do you not think all those changes from last season could make up those 12 points? That's only 4 wins, and funnily enough we've got to 6 points 4 games faster than last year. 

You've also got to take into account that we have no European football so we can play pretty much our best XI every league game. Arsenals already thin squad have got to play Champions League matches midweek. They'll likely have to rest players against the Cardiffs and West Hams and might end up dropping points. That also goes towards us making up that 12 point gap.",0,1377769054,null,0,1377776512,0,cbxl381,t3_1lbjn7,t1_cbxl381,t3_1lbjn7,null,1429661389,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

Looking at the Chelsea squad you have to realise that there is only one ""goal scorer"", Lukaku. Torres and Ba just don't look like regular goal scorers. All the more important to make sure Lukaku has a good start to his season. While he is being subbed in for the last 30min or so nobody will really question his lack of goals.

Marchmont is already a heavily populated residential area. The majority of roads in Marchmont have massive speed bumps and 20 is already in operation I believe outside James Gillespie's High School. As you move closer towards Sciennes, you have a 20mph limit outside the Sick Kids with several Priority Over Oncoming Traffic notices. Every other residential road with flats/houses has cars parked on both sides making the need to speed risky/unneccessary.

The Grange again is somewhat similar. Most of the residential streets near to Carlton Cricket club have speed bumps, some of which are quite brutal, with cars being parked on both sides. Some streets in The Grange which are closer to Marchmont have cars parked on both sides and allow enough space for only 1 car to pass through. I can appreciate one or 2 roads such as Lauder Road are incredibly wide &amp; long giving more reason to speed but this is a minority. I dislike driving on the side roads in The Grange primarily because there's too many speedbumps and there are enough major roads to service the traffic anyway.

The final problem is always going to be how to enforce these new laws. All in all, poorly thought out process, there are a few seriously problematic areas/streets which need to be looked at first.

From their conferences before the election it was clear that the Conservatives wanted to import and rebrand it as ""Strives vs Scroungers"" because they saw just how easily people are suckered in to acting against their own interests as a result.

The reasoning as simple as it is insidious, all you need to do to succeed is work hard. If you fail, you didn't try hard enough and if you succeed then you *must* have done. It's an egocentric reinforcement that pats people on the back and says ""you don't owe what you have to luck! You owe it to your own hard work!"" an incredibly seductive sentiment that tricks us into believing a lie.

The upshot, and the reasons the Conservatives are such a fan, is this means those who have wealth *must* have earnt it. Being rich becomes being moral and the ideas of distributing wealth from those who have it to those who need it becomes abhorrent. If you need it you didn't try hard enough, if you have the audacity to ask for help instead of buckling down you are a scrounger.

The problem is that it's very hard to convince people of this in a top down manner, we have an inherent distrust of those that have more telling you they deserve it. Yet as they say a problem can just be another word for an opportunity and they've very much sized on this one. Instead of telling people you that they are better than the people who have less and more than that that those who have less are trying to pick your pocket of your own hard work. 

And so we have the war of the people who are on benefits. Admitting that we should help them is to admit that our circumstance is as much dictated by outside factors as our own force of will and the whole myth unravels. You can't keep people working hard in the belief they are simply an temporarily embarrassed millionaire if being a millionaire can, in the end, come down to nothing but luck in some cases. That you can work hard all your life and end up in the gutter through no fault of your own. 

The theory simply demands that those who need help can't be worthy of being helped, that if they think they should be helped they must be looking for a way to cheat the system. It's for some, very sad, reason much easier to convince people that it's those below them holding them down rather than those above stamping on their fingers. We are being duped into fighting each other at a time in which we should be turning our anger towards them. 

It's those above, those who have the wealth and who are still working hard to concentrate it in as few hands as possible that crashed our markets and put us in hell and yet it's now the vulnerable at the bottom of the heap who have the littlest power who are now the devil? 

It is as inane as it is insidious and insane and yet it's working just as those who benefit most from it intended.  ",0,1377771391,null,0,1377779643,0,cbxldvy,t3_1l9ke7,t1_cbxldvy,t3_1l9ke7,null,1429661251,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

&gt; I agree we didn't save when times were good which wasn't a good idea but Tony Blaire and Gordon Brown did not fuck the country over. 

Illegal wars, massive expansion of surveillance, numerous white elephants with billions of pounds wasted on each of them, huge deficits, borderline corruption and general incompetence. Sounds pretty bad.

&gt; The situation changed and our hand wasn't as good as other countries.

A situation that Labour created with their inspired attitude to banking regulation (and the FSA), and their exemplary record on public spending.

&gt; The Tories rolled back on spending our way out of the recession and we are now in a worst position than before.

Perhaps if Labour hadn't overspent for the years before the recession (and not encouraged everyone else to do the same) then there'd be money to spend on useful things. I'm not sure spending loads of money on fire control centres is great for the economy unless you work for the company that is being paid to run them despite never being commissioned, for example. Or a useless multi billion pound ID card system which serves no useful purpose other then to allow the government to amass yet more data they have no business collecting.

&gt; tddr: A world recession is not the fault of Labour.

A world recession where London is a global financial centre, regulated by the (Labour) British government, and where that regulation failed. RBS, HBOS, Northern Rock. All British banks, and all of them collapsed. Yet Brown was happy to say how wonderful the likes of Fred Goodwin is years before.

It does amaze me how so many people have rose-tinted glasses as far as Labour's misdeeds are concerned (it sounds like you were looking for an excuse to support Labour again) yet many of the same people will whine about Thatcher for decades to come.",0,1377775005,null,0,false,0,cbxlv9k,t3_1lbkdv,t1_cbxlv9k,t1_cbxltay,null,1429661026,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

The overwhelming majority of average people in the streets couldn't care less if you're Anglican or Catholic or whatever. We put all that Christian religiosity behind us at the end of the middle ages when the Enlightenment happened and it became somewhat ok not to be insanely pious serf.

What exactly have current government been shown to be doing? I'm not saying Labour are perfect (far from it) but all political parties are similar and its unfair to pin all of the issues on the last government. The tories, after all voted in support for the illegal war and surveillance laws. 

&gt;Perhaps if Labour hadn't overspent for the years before the recession

The most of the world was overspending which is the cause of the WORLD finical crisis. I don't see how you can blame this on one party in one country. It looks like you have an axe to grind.

Please let me reiterate my position. I will vote labour because there are no other credible parties which stand a chance of keeping the conservative out of power. I'm not a huge fan of labour, I not a member, I didn't even vote for them in the last election. I do however look at our history a little more pragmatically that perhaps you do. I think about what I want for this country and where my moral compass is point and I look for a party that is pointing in a similar direction.

 In a ideal world we wouldn't have such a limited supply of parties to pick from but we do and we can't change that at the moment. I will not vote in the next election for conservative because there policies do not align well with my views. Thats not to say that come the next election, they may do a 180 and in which case I will reassess my position.

tldr: I'm not a fan of labour, nor a member. I go vote for political parties who's policies I can most agree with. If you are a strong conservative supporter then today we will disagree. Perhaps tomorrow my moral compass will shift and we will agree.

That isn't a goal of feminism. Hell, it's not at all an accepted truism in feminist theory that objectification even exists.

But *even if it was* then it must be accepted that actions such as this campaign make it more difficult for women to get material about their own sexuality published, which does cause harm. It must be accepted that *if* (and I would suggest very strongly that such a notion is bollocks) access to sexually explicit material caused cultural issues that these magazines are examples of, they are tiny, tiny examples compared to say the internet and therefore their removal requires a disproportionate amount of effort for the effect generated and therefore will achieve no cultural change.

Put it this way - does any campaigner against these magazines, anywhere, agree that given none of those publications will exist for simple economic reasons (the collapse of the magazine sector) in ten years time women's lot will automatically get better without any other changes?

&gt; Trident is Cams white elephant,

You mean the nuclear deterrent that was inherited? That's not quite the same as deciding on his own initiative that we must have fire control centres that we can't use or an ID card system that is useless, or many of the other things that Labour tried to do.

&gt; we still have a huge deficit but its OK cause we're sacking all the nurses soldiers and police officers ad giving their bosses 200k+ payoffs.

Sacking all the nurses? That's odd, they're advertising on the radio around here for more as they are understaffed (though IMO they aren't paid enough and the hospital imposes other crap like car parking charges on them, but this has been the case for years). That's the still publicly owned NHS hospital too.

As for the payoffs, would that be a result of employment contracts that may well have been signed a few years ago before they took office? I don't think the government would get too far, nor would it look very good if they didn't adhere to the contract and were taken to court.

&gt; A  situation cause by a WORLD recession... labor didn't run the world.

Labour were supposed to be regulating the financial activity of one of the world's global financial centres. Why is it so hard for people to think that what the UK chooses to do might have had a bit of an effect on a "" world recession""? They should also have been looking at the dodgy activities of the UK banks that we had to bail out, but they didn't. Don't forget how they made (the otherwise okay) Lloyds take on the rotting carcass that was HBOS.. and then needed a bailout.

&gt; The recession was started with the US sub-prime mortgage crisis.

Again, you're trying to make it out as if the UK isn't at all complicit in what went on. Are you Gordon Brown?

Thankfully in Scotland we have a viable left leaning alternative in the SNP, but the rest of the UK isn't so lucky, it seems to me like Labour may have learned their lesson by not blindly supporting a war, DC and the conservatives on the other hand have not. 

I also don't see any evidence anywhere of the conservatives doing anything to stop these Labour policies that ruined the country the first time round.  Were the Conservatives running on a platform of more banking regulation?  Since they got into power have they regulated more or less?

It's easy to look back and say these people ruined the country don't give them another chance, but if we do that then who would we vote for?   The fact is Labour appear on this issue to be aligning themselves with the majority of the British public, and for that they can earn back some of the trust they lost. 

I'm not saying lets not look back at what these people did, but to use it as an argument not to vote for them without examining how they've changed is asinine.

The way I see it currently is that the ConDems deliberately suspended Labour policies that at the tail end of the last government were causing economic growth and recovery, to begin an ideological war that plunged us back into recession.  They have done nothing to increase our personal freedoms, in fact it appears they have allowed GCHQ to collect limitless amounts of information on us.  Would this be different if Labour were in power? 

Maybe not, but the point is that finger pointing and blaming one group for everything that has happened isn't helpful, furthermore looking at what they did in the past and not allowing for the possibility that they have changed is harmful to us all and keeps us stuck in the past and ignoring the future.

I wouldn't discount either on a purely dogmatic basis, but both theories have better quantitative and qualitative aspects depending on what parts of economies you're looking at. It's not my forté and I don't enjoy it as much as I orginally thought I would... Finance is much more interesting. I honestly think that both economics and politics are both seeking a new language (ergo, dialogue) for our changing times.

As for mediums of exchange, I have a very, very low opinion of fiat currency. I wouldn't necessarily throw the baby out with the bath water straight away but our current system is obviously not very good. Debasing the currency significantly was an asisine move by Gordon Brown, regardless of how much the underlying assets was worth at the time. However going back to the Gold Standard is not the solution. I'll have a read of your article when I get home, I read the first few paragraphs and it looks interesting.

I'm more in favour of just getting sound science dictate policy for a while, ie, food vouchers are actually a *very* effective mechanism for wealth redistribution. The social stigma exists for welfare claimants whether we like it or not, but food vouchers are something I would definitely consider bringing in. Basically I'd spend more time listening to policymakers and less time listening to self important thinktanks.

I'd also set about obliterating the changes that Cameron has brought in to reform Planning, essentially moving from an implicit allow under his system back to the much more sensible implicit deny where the case for development has to be made. I would do my best to hand more power back to town planners and urban designers, taking it away from local councillors whose interests are often not aligned with those of the majority of their consitutents.

I'm also a massive supporter of electoral reform at all levels. The current system of First Past The Post is dysfunctional and not fit for purpose (although entrenched parties would argue it's working fine for keeping marginal parties out of power).

Obviously I'd have to have a bit more of a read and a think about these topics if I were to go ahead with such an ordeal. :)

true,c0mpassion,null,null,"&gt;The reason this is happening is the same reason the American Dream has been such an abject failure but one that is fetishsied because of how deeply useful it's been to given classes in society. From their conferences before the election it was clear that the Conservatives wanted to import and rebrand it as ""Strives vs Scroungers"" because they saw just how easily people are suckered in to acting against their own interests as a result.
&gt;
&gt;The reasoning as simple as it is insidious, all you need to do to succeed is work hard. If you fail, you didn't try hard enough and if you succeed then you must have done. It's an egocentric reinforcement that pats people on the back and says ""you don't owe what you have to luck! You owe it to your own hard work!"" an incredibly seductive sentiment that tricks us into believing a lie.
&gt;
&gt;The upshot, and the reasons the Conservatives are such a fan, is this means those who have wealth must have earnt it. Being rich becomes being moral and the ideas of distributing wealth from those who have it to those who need it becomes abhorrent. If you need it you didn't try hard enough, if you have the audacity to ask for help instead of buckling down you are a scrounger.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that it's very hard to convince people of this in a top down manner, we have an inherent distrust of those that have more telling you they deserve it. Yet as they say a problem can just be another word for an opportunity and they've very much sized on this one. Instead of telling people you that they are better than the people who have less and more than that that those who have less are trying to pick your pocket of your own hard work.
&gt;
&gt;And so we have the war of the people who are on benefits. Admitting that we should help them is to admit that our circumstance is as much dictated by outside factors as our own force of will and the whole myth unravels. You can't keep people working hard in the belief they are simply an temporarily embarrassed millionaire if being a millionaire can, in the end, come down to nothing but luck in some cases. That you can work hard all your life and end up in the gutter through no fault of your own.
&gt;
&gt;The theory simply demands that those who need help can't be worthy of being helped, that if they think they should be helped they must be looking for a way to cheat the system. It's for some, very sad, reason much easier to convince people that it's those below them holding them down rather than those above stamping on their fingers. We are being duped into fighting each other at a time in which we should be turning our anger towards them.
&gt;
&gt;It's those above, those who have the wealth and who are still working hard to concentrate it in as few hands as possible that crashed our markets and put us in hell and yet it's now the vulnerable at the bottom of the heap who have the littlest power who are now the devil?
&gt;
&gt;It is as inane as it is insidious and insane and yet it's working just as those who benefit most from it intended.

There are plenty of jobs that require personal plans be put on one side in order to prioritise work. Tony Blair has seated himself in a *very* important role - you're right that he didn't plan in advance - but he ought to have put his plans aside to deal with this. 

At the very least, deciding to go ahead and go on holiday as worldwide news develops sends a poor message. 

Blair, Cameron, Clegg, Miliband, the CEO's of major companies - these are men enjoying both money and power - the cost of it should be their 100% commitment to their role. Blair earn't £20 million in 2011 and apparently costs [£400,000 to keep](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/9496328/Tony-Blair-still-costs-the-public-400000-a-year.html) at the moment. For a man who is in no way impoverished and has installed himself in a very comfortable position - is the day after a major crisis in an area he is concerned with really the right choice? 

&gt; ...he was under no obligation to return because he has no pubic to answer to.

Then what use is he? Again, if he and those like him are being paid so well - they should be 100% accountable. I really do recognise that he booked his holiday without knowing this would happen - but his response *should* have been to drop everything and attend it. 

It's a major issue that is sparking worldwide interest - it should *not* be too small a matter that it can wait for Blair to have his holiday. It's unfortunate timing - but he was quick to enter the Middle East on a military basis and should at least do his job there, or find someone who *is* willing to.",0,1377785729,null,0,false,0,cbxodah,t3_1lbph8,t1_cbxodah,t1_cbxo0ac,null,1429659859,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Compare him to Micky, who went for a similar amount. Or Costa, who we also almost nabbed for a similar amount. Or Chadli. Lamela for only a few million more when hes leaps and bounds above Yarmolenko.  Yarmolenko is definitely not the same caliber of player as those guys. He does not seem to represent value for money. 

Hell he wasn't even mentioned here or anywhere else until after we'd missed out on seemingly everyone else. He is definitely not one of our top picks for the window or we'd have done this way sooner. I trust BR and the scouts just fine. I'm sure Yarmolenko has a role ro play. I do highly doubt he's worth 20mil+ though, especially compared to what a similar amount of money has been able to buy other clubs this window. With thw shitty timing of this, the veey high price tag, and on the end of a summer of watching top class players slip throgh our fingers, this feels panicky.

We have Sandro and Capoue in this role. The next furthest forward is the box to box midfielder competent in all aspects of his game, a jack of all trades but master of none. He connects the defence and  the offence, for us this is Paulinho and Dembele. 4-3-3 can be played with 2 box to box midfielders, usually used by teams who want to be more robust and harder to beat at the expense of goal scoring capability. The last player in the midfield is the playmaker, Iniesta is the master of this role, he is not a 10 however, VdV is a 10 and does not fit this role. This role requires the player to sit deeper than the 10 and link up the play, keeping the ball moving in midfield and joining up the final 3rd with the midfield. He needs to be able to connect with the wingers specifically, a 10's job is to sit further forward and link with the striker, pushing through balls into the striker and providing. A deeper playmaking midfielder i.e. Eriksen also contributes defensively and can sit deeper or press in midfield if required. A 10 doesn't fit in a 4-3-3 as this leaves the midfield light as it effectively creates a 4-2-1-3, in which the 2 can be outmatched.

First Match = dota2://matchid=290550079

First thing I notice is that bounty has a lane to himself because furion is jungling, so the pressure is on, and Ogre is not supporting well. He's taking aggro from the creeps, which causes your creeps to take less damage, so the ranged creep doesn't die, and ranged creeps push the wave. Nothing you can do about that. Bounty outlevels you. he leaves the lane at 6 and he's happy.

You need to resist the autoattack itch. The creep waves needs to be under your tower to give ogre space to harass bounty out of the lane. Go practice lane control in a private server, try to keep the creep wave under your tower, and if you can't, figure out why. Mostly this game was out of your control. They had two split pushers and a bounty who hit a comfortable level 6. Maybe if you shut down bounty, you'd have had a chance.

Mid game stuff worth noting, your farm speed isn't amazing but it's fine. Try to be more efficient in your blinks and right clicks. Teamfight at 32:00, you use manta and then blinked into a fight. Bad choice on both counts; save manta for when you're silenced and save blink for when you need to escape. Also if you had your quelling blade in that fight, you could have cut your way out of the sprout. Other mistakes were made, like ck not using his bkb until he died, silence hit on two bkb units after they use their spells, dream coil only hits cm, pudge walks in to die.

On the face of it, 4 indecent images is not really a cause for concern given that the Windows operating system duplicates those images in a thumbnail cache and that those thumbnails are counted in the total.  So in reality there was probably two on the computer.  There is also no indication of what level of offensiveness they were at, if at all.  For instance, were they of his grandchildren playing in the bath etc?  Paedophiles are not caught with four 'indecent' images.  They are caught with hundreds or thousands and most of those offenders have no victim to answer to in court.  On the contrary, the ones who do commit sexual assault against a minor are quite often family or close friends of the family.  My ex was abused for years so I am personally invested in seeing the latter category on trial and imprisoned.

Secondly, as a for shagging teens in the seventies and eighties, big deal!  Everyone was doing it, it was part of the culture back then, it was a different world back then and these recent claims are only made possible because of retroactive legislation introduced in the 2000s and made possible by the EU.  Before then, the UK didn't have a lawful precedent victimising men for acting on their primary biological imperative.  Government needs to stay out of the sexual lives of consenting partners.

I see most people in this thread as children with short memories, mentally ill equipped to recall the reality of just twenty five or so years ago.

Guys like Rolf were having young girls with out of control libidos launch their bodies at him on a daily basis back then.  It's a bit rich crying wolf twenty five years later when the remnants of your life are not looking too appealing and it's just so easy to make allegations these days.  In the eighties, these people would have been laughed out of the police station.

We are living in a vicious society these days.  It's too easy to point the foot soldiers at someone without coming under a reasonable scrutiny.  And as for the CPS considering this to be in the public good, well that just says a hell of a lot about how this witch hunt is politically motivated.  I wonder how many of those making allegations were ignored for years because of dubious claims but have been given the green light to be investigated because it suits the policy of some horrible political agenda?

On a pertinent and relevant level to our times in the west, there is a post-rationalisation that occurs when a woman has engaged by her own volition in a brief sexual intercourse with a man and she later decides it was wrong, because she feels like it, that rather than consider herself promiscuous, that it is the fault of the man she sexually engaged with because he forced her in some way.  Why should a man shoulder the responsibility of a woman's sexuality and if she is legally too young, why should he replace her parents in the responsibility of her sexual integrity?

&gt; Of Senegalese descent, Sakho started his career at Paris FC in 1996 before moving to professional club Paris Saint-Germain in 2002. After excelling in the youth system, Sakho earned a call up the senior team by manager Paul Le Guen. In October 2007, on his league debut, he became the youngest player ever to captain a Ligue 1 club after wearing the armband in the club's 0–0 draw with Valenciennes. Since making his debut with the club, Sakho has become an integral part of the team earning starting berths in the first 11 under managers Paul Le Guen and Antoine Kombouaré. Sakho's playing style and ability have led to the media and former players drawing comparisons to former French international Lilian Thuram.[4][5][6]
Sakho is both a French youth international and senior international. He has earned caps and captained all youth levels. Before earning his first call-up to the senior team, Sakho was playing on the under-21 team serving as the captain. He earned his first call-up to the senior team in August 2010. Sakho made his senior international debut in November 2010 against England.
During the Summer transfer window of 2013, Sakho signed for Liverpool FC after they were hit with an extending list of injuries. To the fans surprise the deal was done quite fast, deals were never done fast while Ian Ayre was on the job, its no surprise the frog-man was last seen in Spain with Diego Costa. It is widely speculated Brendan Rodgers has him trapped in the Anfield basement as to prevent from anymoree transfer catastrophes. Sakho went onto score a last minute goal at Anfield on his debut To win the game.

I have one question; why does it matter if your partner doesn't like Doctor Who or not?  There are things that I don't like (believe it or not, like Game of Thrones, The Great British Bake off or The Apprentice), but that my partner loves watching.  There are things that I really like watching (like Doctor Who, Star Trek, Smallville and the X-Files) that she really doesn't like.  But we are able to concede that they are things they other does like, and therefore watches them.  

We also live together.  Plus, it has meant that I (and she) have watched, and (sometimes) ended up enjoying. A good example of this for me is ""Game of Thrones"", I was not interested in it at all, but she explained the back story to a lot of it, and in the end I have started watching it from time to time, and will probably become more enthralled in it when I am on Annual Leave some time.  

Furthermore, as a result of watching some of the Doctor Who episodes with me earlier this year, and really liking Jenna Louise Coleman as an actress, it caused my partner to actually start kind of liking Doctor Who.  This multiplied by the fact that we both really love The Thick of It, she was beyond excited when it turned out that Peter Capaldi was going to be The Next Doctor.  

If I thought that my partner had decided not to watch, or neglect something, because I didn't like it I would probably feel quite sad...maybe try and include him in some of the enjoyment of it; you might find he becomes accepting of it, and potentially even like it.",0,1377790655,null,0,false,0,cbxq40b,t3_1lalmb,t1_cbxq40b,t3_1lalmb,null,1429658974,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,dave8001,null,null,"Series 1:  Dalek.  I thought that this story was so beautifully written, and Eccleston's portrayal of The Doctor in this episode was perfect.  The last 10 minutes of the episode were just great.

Series 2:  Tooth and Claw. I got into Doctor Who in 1996 when the TV Movie came out.  Obviously, after this there was a long break between that and New Who.  I went back and became acquainted with the classic doctors in the interim.  When Doctor Who returned, I wasn't massively impressed with the styling used for Christopher Eccleston, and therefore found it a huge barrier for enjoying the show.  

To clarify; I actually really like Eccleston as an actor, and even prior to him starring in the show felt that he would have been good as a Doctor...however, I never felt that The Doctor was short hair, leather jackets and jeans, so at first I never really warmed to Eccleston's Doctor.  However; in retrospect I do like him as the doctor.

Subsequently, it was the Episode Tooth and Claw that got me back watching Doctor Who, because it happened to be on and someone else was watching it.  I joined them, really enjoyed it, and haven't stopped watching since.

Series 3.  The next 2 are really difficult to pick, because there are so many......I would have to say ""Family of Blood"" arc.  Mostly because of the final 5 minutes where The Doctor stopped the bad guys.  ""We wanted to live forever, so the Doctor made sure we did"" it gives me chills each time I see it. 

Series 4.  I am torn between Midnight and Turn Left.  They are both episodes where we are light on the opposite character.  Tennant is superb in Midnight, when he is afraid in this episode you are right along beside him.  However; Turn Left has to take it for me I think...Catherine Tate was wonderful.  Her acting allowed you to really get to know Donna in this episode; and really gave her the chance to grow as a character.  Although Donna, until the Doctor, was seen as a goof who was out for a man; the episode let you see that deep down there is someone who really cares about other people, and wants to help in the best way; to the point where she would sacrifice her own life to save another.  Just great.

Specials:  The Waters of Mars...As explained earlier, I am a fan of new and classic who....this episode is just simply the best episode of Doctor Who ever made.  No contest in my opinion.  

Series 5:  Vincent and The Doctor.  Bill Nighy and Tony Curran were so emotive in the last little bit of the episode; you really believed that Nighy was Doctor Black, that Doctor Black really loved Vincent's work and Vincent; and also really believed that Curran was Vincent coming to this new world and seeing how far into the future his underappreciated work was adored.  

Series 6:  The Doctor's Wife.  Can't say more, other than Neil Gaiman was brilliant, and the story was great.

Series 7:  Asylum of The Daleks.  Love Jenna Louise Coleman's introduction to the series; and loved how the twist was revealed.

Christmas Special:  The Snowmen...loved everything about it.
