true,stevemegson,null,null,"In general a district is any subdivision of a county, and a borough is just a district which has been granted permission to call itself a borough and call the leader of the council a mayor. It's similar to the way that a city is just a town that has been given permission to call itself a city.

Having said that, a borough will usually cover a single large town, while other districts will cover several small towns or villages. If a district council has no county council above it, so it is effectively a unitary authority with the combined powers of a county and district council, then it will probably be granted borough status. However, there are also borough councils which share power with a county council. These boroughs are just like other district councils in that county, except that they have a mayor. There are also unitary authorities which aren't boroughs, for example Cornwall is a county council with no district councils under it. Whether a unitary authority is called a county council, a city council, or a borough council is therefore mostly a result of history and has no effect on what the council does.

On a bit of a tangent, for maximum confusion, Rutland's unitary authority is technically a district council (though not a borough) because it was ""promoted"" from being a district of Leicestershire, but calls itself a county council because Rutland was historically a county. Officially it's called ""Rutland County Council District Council"". There actually is a county called Rutland, because when you take a district out of a county and make it a unitary authority you have to create a new county to put it in, but Rutland County Council isn't the council of it because it doesn't have a council.",0,1388520520,null,0,false,0,ceeaosb,t3_1u3g0u,t1_ceeaosb,t3_1u3g0u,null,1427913905,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

Sterling has done well lately but he shouldn't be starting every match for us, he's not good enough yet.  Bringing in a better player to start most games ahead of him won't derail his growth by any stretch.  He'll still get plenty of playing time in cups and against the lesser clubs plus he'll have a more mature and experienced player to learn from and compete with in the team.

That said I'm very skeptical of whether or not Salah is a big step up from Sterling in any area.  He's only a couple of years older and looks a similar player.  He's done well in the Swiss league and had a couple of strong performances for Basel in the Champion's League (although being the standout player for Basel only means so much) which is nice but hardly indicative of how he'd handle himself in the EPL.   Salah and Assaidi actually don't really seem like vastly different players to me and Assaidi came from a tougher league than the Swiss one.

To them it was a war of liberation in which Britain acted honourably by preventing an expansionist Germany from taking over Europe as the Russian and Ottoman Empires were in decline. 

I think rather than forming your opinions on the basis of Blackadder or something you heard in the pub you ought to look at the pan-European and perspective and the conduct of the war as a whole. 

If you bother to study the history of the period in depth the UK government made honest efforts to get a peaceful settlement and they only went to war when that became impossible. 

It was the UK government that tried to broker a peace deal between Austria-Hungary and Russia and Serbia, it was the Germans who forced Austria-Hungary to reject that peace deal. 

The UK establishment did not choose to start the war, they had to choose whether to sacrifice Europe to a power-crazed Kaiser or whether to take a stand. 

The idea that it was only the working class that sacrificed is compete bullshit as well, it was the upper class which suffered the highest proportional casualty rate. The whole reason the Landed Aristocracy of Britain almost died out in the early 20th c. is because of the rate at which their males died in WWI.

true,Quazijoe,null,null,"It's about a time travelling alien who uses a ship called the tardis to travel anywhere and when.

The doctor takes on 'companions'  to travel along as he has adventures. These are usually meant to help the audience relate better to the doctor and his antics as he is alien in reasoning and behavior.

The doctor is a mysterious figure so even 50 some years later we still know very little about him.

The doctor is generally a good person, who is considered a hero, but is unlikely to resort to violence. That has been changing recently and is debatable but you rarely will see him try to cause someone pain and suffering and it is against his character.

If you want a good place to start you can start with number 9 in the 2005 relaunch. It's meant to reintroduce the doctor and his universe to the audience. Now because of the time it was launched the graphics are no where near as good as they are now, so if that matters to you you can launch at the Matt smith era. The most recent doctor.

You should watch the following episodes to understand Matt smiths era but they are epic anyway so it isn't that bad.

Blink, and the library, a two parter.

This is from the David tennant era. I started here'd and was intrigued enough to go back and watch.

One thing you have to understand. The show is written in such a way that when the doctor dies, he changes. Regenerates it's called. A new actor is cast and is now the doctor. This is not a new actor playing the same doctor, this is a new doctor.

Regeneration rewrites the person with new personality traits preferences, methodologies... And face.

There are a lot of referential plot points but that doesn't always stop you from enjoying or following a episode.

Sometimes this show is dramatic and uber realistic. Sometimes it's comical, crazy, and barely in touch with reality, sometimes you will watch an episode and be haunted by the shadows. This show is good at making you feel emotions very quickly.

Once you get into it, you are into it. You will over look the junk episodes and love it for what it is. An experience.

Some fans really hate the current showrunner - Stephen Moffat. He's changed the tone and direction of the show since becoming involved with it, making these clockwork plots and complicated timelines the main focus of the show.

Some people really like that, but some criticize him severely. I don't hate it, it gives me and my friends something to talk about, but sometimes it does seem needlessly complicated.

.

My criticism is that the method of storytelling is meant to seem very clever, while it really isn't. They constantly leave loose threads and unresolved plots, so that they can later pick that back up and say that they planned it all along.

A good example is pretty much anything regarding River Song. She was introduced during David Tennant's time, but then was brought back again still claiming that she knows all this stuff that the Doctor doesn't know - we're meant to believe that they had planned to bring her back and make her a major part of Matt Smith's story, when they probably didn't.

Her story also gets tons of retcons (retroactive continuity). At some later time, they reveal what ""really"" happened to River so that it seems like they must have the show completely written at least 2 seasons ahead - when that's just not how it is. It's meant to seem extremely well planned, when it's really a very cheap way of telling a story.

true,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I am not advocating the basic income, but I can see some advantages.

There are serious problems with JSA/HB. The first is the requirement to be actively searching for work in order to qualify. That might seem to make sense, but there are millions more people than jobs, wtf is the point of *all* those people wasting 30 hours a week searching for jobs which don't exist.

If they didn't have to do that they could do something useful instead. Charity or voluntary work, or maybe finding a bit of work locally or use some skill they have to make a bit on money. They might eventually become self employed.

The other problem is, if you do get a low paid job, your benefits get cut, so you are barely any better off. It is tough to spend 20 hours a week doing a boring job and get nothing to show for it.

Finally, we have vast systems in place to make sure nobody gets benefits they are not entitled to. That would *all go* if we had basic income, and it would save a fortune. Nor would you have people getting sanction or slipping through the cracks and ending up starving.

In practice, the minimum wage would have to be reduced, to take account of the extra income people already have. Tax would have to increase so that wealthy people are effectively paying it back. It could probably be arranged so that most people are about the same, the poorest might be a bit better off (paid for by efficiency of ditching JSA etc), but mostly if someone ends up out of work they are treated like a human being and allowed to choose what they want to do.

The main thing I am dubious about is how HB would fit into this. Rents vary too much around the country.

Playing with conventional wingers, this would be my first 11:

http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=229c

As I see it, Lennon is by far our most effective winger. Lamela may have potential on the right, but right now Lennon will win us games. Townsend is the best option we have on the left, on his day he's very effective. With this arrangement I think we have no option but to play with two strikers, as AVB's failure showed.

With inverted wingers:

http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=229s

Squeezing Lamela into the team so that he is effective now is hard. He is not a winger. He only looks to come inside from the right, so I think maybe he should be played further forward. Gylfi could do the same on the left. To do this, we need to push the wing backs higher up, meaning three in the centre at the back. Only one of verts or vlad should push forward at a time.

&gt; My retort was that they're just as bad, if not worse. Do you disagree with that assessment? 

Mostly no, for Russia you are 100% correct. I'd rather be under the heel of Churchill than Stalin. 

I'd disagree with some of your points on China though, take Tibet for example, China's activities there have been far softer than Britain in Northern Ireland, it's not like Iraq or India or any other colonies. They have a historic link with the country and it's independence was a very short affair following a civil war. Tibet has been a part of China for longer than the UK has existed. Popular to common belief China never really ""repressed"" Tibet, they did progressively remove legal authority from monk system but that needed done as it was a horribly repressive brutal system based on illiterate forced selfdom. The CIA seized on this and produced the whole ""Free Tibet"" meme which is largely based on outright lies from Radio Free Asia which they themselves run. The last thing any of them want is ""freedom"". These are monks who brainwash dirt-poor kids into killing themselves with the promises of rewards in the next life. When we arrest people like that we call it ""counter terrorism"", when China does it it's ""repression"". 

Or Korea, the country was already partitioned by the USSR/USA as the spoils of WW2 and after the Russians left the North (which hadn't gone full retard yet) tried to reunite the country. When you take an independent view all it was was a nation helping it's neighbour kick out a malevolent superpower who'd taken over (like us in France 1939 perhaps?). The US military government in South Korea from '45 to '48 was a violent repressive regime, hundreds of thousands of people died in popular uprisings before the war even started. No one really acknowledges this, particularly as it harms the rhetoric that the North is ""pure evil"" and that we stand for all things just. 

&gt; The EU (see below RE Ukraine). The recent breakthroughs over the nuclear stand off with Iran. The bilateral agreement with Russia over chemical weapons in Syria. 

IMHO I don't think we come across as very ""soft"" in those examples, maybe the first because I don't think anyone has died yet. 

In Ukraine we have pretty much attempted a regime change for our own benefit. It will be interesting to see how deep the connections go between the organizers of the protests and our governments, more info will come in the next few years I'm sure. The speed at which the UK press jumped on the story with a consistent message was a dead giveaway that it was a scheduled event. 

In Iran we have sanctioned an entire country and forced them off the worlds economic radar for claims about their nuclear program that we know full well to be false. No different from WMD claims in Iraq, we've used these fears to try to destroy a country from the inside out in the hope that they would have a revolution. Our allies like the US are funding multiple terrorist groups within Iran, several linked to the opium trade which we re-enabled in Afghanistan in 2002, groups with thousands of victims under their belts.

In Syria we knew also the claims of their use of chemical weapons were sketchy as hell. The whitehouse had in it's hands official reports that proved the rebels possessed and had already used these weapons yet it lied to the world and said it believed ""the regime"" had done it. Russia called us out on the bullshit, as did most of the non-mainstream media. The ""deal"" we won was a complete loss for us. Our governments were pushing for a UN resolution which would legitimise air strikes, undoubtedly with the same intent as Libya to help the rebels win the war. Putin bitchslapped the west back in the middle of the previous week. We got nothing but a step backwards, the removal of the one thing that would guarantee a UN resolution. We've been slowly backing away from the conflict ever since. A conflict we have been instrumental in creating BTW, wikileaks has docs showing US support going back to 2006 for the Syrian rebels, setting up bases for them in Turkey and multiple propaganda wings based from the UK (Barada &amp; SOHR) three years before the ""spontaneous"" protests began. 

Two of your examples so far have body counts in the thousands and neither of them has any end in sight or any actual achievement of any of our objectives.

true,theirishembassy,null,null,"TFC/Spurs suppoter here (located in toronto). my take on the situation, including a brief description of MLS salary practices for those who don't know anything about the league: 


the league has a salary cap to ensure a steady growth without bankrupting clubs, so a designated player (DP) slot was created to bring marque names to north american. signing someone like beckham, defoe, or dempsey would cost most of the salary cap without it. after invoking the DP rule, you can pay the player whatever you want. for more info, there's a short wiki on it [HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap#Major_League_Soccer).


 
now on to TFC: our chairman has made the mistake of saying that the club has an abundance of funds to spend on obtaining two DP strikers. we all know levy, he's a shrewd business man to begin with so saying ""we've got money to spend"" is probably the stupidest thing you can do. to put this in perspective, we scored 30 goals last season, with 8 of them coming from our starter, robert earnshaw (whose a year older than defoe), with 3 of them coming from the spot. we need goals, and defoe looks to be a good fit for what we're trying to build, levy knows that. defoe is going to move, so it's not a matter of ""if"" he leaves as much as it is ""for how much"". 



why this rumour has been dragged out as long as it has: in the summer we tried to sign diego forlan. it was all but announced, with several club officials commenting on it, when the deal fell through. having a signing slip through the fingers of an EPL club is commonplace, but to a 7 year old MLS club it's incredibly embarrassing. it wasn't the first time either, but it was certainly the worst/most public.

**Best attendance**: the Bundesliga has the biggest total attendance with 13,811,075 (EPL: 13,148,465). 

**most unpredictable**: this season was quite unpredictable for the top clubs in EPL, I give you that (top 3 within 2 points). Arguably, La Liga has top 3 within 5 points (with top 2 on same number of points) and the French Ligue 1 has top 3 within 4 points.

true,[deleted],null,null,"it's easy to nitpick my post but the fact remains that the premier league has the best combination of the above. 

I'm going to compare top 4 leagues in a very subjective manner

Bundesliga: 

* attendance: 1st

* best teams: 3rd (only bayern can compete on a european stage, dortmund's run last year was a clear aberration) 

* best players: 4th (only 10 or so world class players)

* unpredictability: 3rd, bayern dortmund duopoly, with bayern scooping everything recently. 

La Liga: 

* attendance: 3rd

* best teams: 1.5st--they have the 2 best teams in europe, and one or two marginal teams. barca and real are supported by an unfair tv revenue system and govt assistance though. although this is subjective, I reckon England's 5th and 6th placed teams would beat their spanish counterparts handily (liverpool v bilbao and man u v sociedad. yeah. it would be a bloodbath.) I'm giving them a draw with the prem on this basis.

* best players: 1st--the very very best players play in spain but in general the depth of the league is weak as evidenced by loads of good spanish players coming to the EPL from clubs like malaga, valencia, atletico. the teams don't pay them enough so while the 2 biggest clubs have some of the very best players in the world, and most of the top 10 best players, the rest of the merely excellent players have been jumping ship.

* unpredictability: 4th. no questions there. a non-real-barca team last won the league ten years ago. 

Serie A

* attendance: 4th. italy sucks for attendance, probably because they are poor. 

* best teams: 4th, no question. no teams aside from Juve are any good. only a lackluster AC Milan are in the CL now and they will be knocked out.

* best players: 3rd. probably edge the german league. there are some class players in Italy. 

* unpredictability: 2nd. 3 different winners in the past 4 years. exciting league. close at the top too. roma, napoli, juve, milan all could win it. 

The Premier League

* attendance: 2nd. just behind germany. note that the championship is the 4th most attended league in europe. englishmen watch football. 

* best teams: 1.5st. the top 3 (arsenal city chelsea) can compete with anyone in the world on their day. wouldn't be surprised to see an english team win the CL this year, although Real Barca Bayern are very good too.  incredible depth in the league too. 

* best players: 2nd. suarez, rooney, rvp, yaya toure, mata, oscar, hazard, silva, gerrard, ozil, lampard, cech, mignolet--come on. at least a few of these will world cup winners. 

* unpredictability: 1st. yes, only chelsea city and man u have won it recently, but this year arsenal could do the business, and liverpool could conceivably get there in the next few seasons. it's so damn close this year, and anyone can beat anyone. the little teams acquit themselves well too, because they aren't starved for cash and can actually compete. 

assuming that 1st gives you 4 points, 2nd 3 pts, 3rd 2 points, and 4th 1 point, the totals come up with: 

EPL: 13.5

La Liga: 10.5

Bundesliga: 9

Serie A: 7

The Premier League wins handily overall. It's not the outstanding best in every category but overall it simply has no equal in the world. That's why it's the most watched league in the world, by far.

Chirivella is more of a defensive mid and would work as more of an anchor like what position Lucas currently plays as he often slots in besides the two center backs while fullbacks bomb forward.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"The ""Free movement of people"" is one of the most disgusting aspects of the EU in my opinion... And here is why: As much as we may dislike the rapid influx of immigration to the UK, spare a thought for the poor kids who are pouring out of Spain and Portugal to come and workhere because there is **no work** in their own countries for that generation. The problem with the EUs free movement is that it has created a mobile workforce of 400 million people... now you might see that as an opportunity... But imagine a time, maybe 40 years from now when your children are forced to go and work in Spain, Poland, Germany or wherever because **that is where the work is**... and in a mobile workforce you go where the work is, or you don't work.

Apart from a few high-functioning brits who have *carpe diem*'ed free movement for work, often in very specific industries like academia and engineering - if you actually speak to the people who have really *benefited* from free movement like the Poles, Spaniards and Portuguese kids in their 20s you can quickly see that the **Free** Movement of peoples hasn't been *free* at all. What they really wanted were jobs and futures in their own countries, but were forced by necessity to come to a foreign country to seek work and face the passive distrust and dislike of the local population.
