Now that the Edinburgh Agreement is in place, the Scottish Government have asked the European Commission for their opinion. The EC have stated that they will now offer that opinion, but can only do so if asked by a member state (as that is the only body they can recognise: this is why they could not comment prior to the Edinburgh Agreement).

Scotland is represented within the EU by the UK, however Westminster are currently refusing to request that opinion on the grounds that the referendum will not pass, and therefore there is no need to discuss it. I'm paraphrasing, but you can find some quotes from the Scottish Secretary Michael Moore making this argument to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html).

We have the politicans of some backwater nation screaming hate speech against us and ignoring the islanders entirely. They're deflecting the sovereignty of people over their own land by attacking us instead. The Falklands are the Falklands first, British second, European third. They're not, at all, Argentinian. They're more Spanish than Argentinian by Argentinean logic. 

Let's also not forget that the whole **nation** of Argentina is a fucking colony. They're hypocrites of the worst degree.

The people of the island decide who they belong to. Just as us Brits decide whether we're European or just British, or Scotland decides if it's just Scotland (a touchy issue, but an important point to make). People have the right to autonomy, and that's something us British have actually stuck to the for the past 100 years. Starting from releasing our first colonies all the way up to Hong Kong. We let go of a huge empire, and we did fairly gracefully. The Commonwealth has remained, and nations choose to be in it. Similarly, the Falklands have chosen to be British. Wales has chosen to be British. Scotland has chosen to be British. Northern Ireland (touchy area once again) has chosen to be British. The Shetlands, channel Islands, and finally, England, have all decided to be British. 

The only difference between that and the Falklands is distance, and Argentina won't shut up about a detail that stopped having any meaning when flight and radio was invented, and entirely destroyed by the internet and space travel. 

Think about it this way; if Argentina decided they wanted to claim England because the Spanish once did during the religious wars of the 1500s, they would be laughed all the way back to non-existence. This is no different. At all. In any way other than distance.

true,coltonleavitt,null,null,"Minimum wage is regulated in the US on the State and Federal level, and can vary from state to state. The lowest State minimum wage is $7.25/hr while the federal minimum wage is somewhere near $2.13/hr. Your typical hourly retail job will pay based on the State's minimum wage, but servers and other positions earning tips are paid based on the federal minimum wage. 

Due to taxes paid on tips earned, most servers never see their hourly pay check and rely on tips alone for their wages. 

The gratuity charge is typically added on bills of larger parties. The restaurant I work at has it stated in the menu that ""Parties of 8 or more will have an 18% gratuity charge added to the bill."" This gratuity charge is a blessing for waiters and waitresses, seeing as how larger parties are often more difficult to serve and leave more room for mistakes to be made. Something that is unfortunate, but more likely to happen. 

If you are planning on eating at a restaurant in the US anytime soon and your server preforms his/her basic job, PLEASE tip at least 15%. There are, of course, extenuating circumstances in which a server deserves more or less than this percentage, but please be mindful of what your server is actually getting paid!

Then again, a lot of very profitable modern businesses are not all that dependent on land.

true,scg_30,1953,Frank Lampard,"These are good caveats to remember when reading DBFM's post, especially the first two, but in response to bullet three:

While in theory you are correct, the problem is that in reality Lampard (though transitioning better than your average footballer) is not as effective in his new found deep-lying role as the players that you mention are (schweini, alonso) and by the same token, though I agree that Ramires could, or perhaps should, be able to perform a role similar to Khedira the fact is that he so far hasn't shown himself capable of doing so consistently, (bar the 1st half at home against Arsenal). 

I think DBFM's point about Ramires' best and most natural position being as the third man in a 4-3-3 midfield has merit and shouldn't be dismissed.

In short, while I agree that in theory our personnel should be able to fit into a 4-2-3-1 quite well, the fact is that performances have shown they're not yet ready to exceed in that system the way Khedira and Schweini do. 

Whether that will come with time, who knows? But given our squad's current capabilities I don't think a two man central midfield is the way to go. We struggle to control the flow of the game in that area of the park for long periods, (again barring the 1st half at home against Arsenal), and imo this is a very large contributing factor to our inability to see out a result from a winning position in the final third of matches (60-90min).

I listened to some of the debate and many put forward that it ""didn't matter"" due to existing legislation recognising couples, and that it was not a significant issue at this point of economic crisis in the UK.

This emphasis of our differences seems to pander toward nationalist people.

The country was not voting Conservative due to some huge ideological swing that happened in England. It happened because Gordon Brown was an ineffective leader, the economy flatlined, the deficit was huge and people lost faith in Labour (especially when it came to issues like immigration). Scotland was offered an alternative to this in the SNP. Who else was England going to vote for? People voted Conservative as they felt it was the best way to cut the deficit and the Tories were becoming more centrist. Austerity is not a nice thing to experience but people felt it was a necessary evil.

Now we are subjected to discussions about how ""Westminster"" (which seems to be a politically correct phrase for ""England"") stole Scotland's oil and other nonsense like this. Alex Salmond continues to talk up Scotland's future in the EU and building a closer relationship with their Scandinavian neighbors but as far as I'm concerned Scotland has neighbors in the UK that generally work fine together.

I also despise talk of how ""British unity"" is some made up out of date imperial project (as many SNP'ers claim). It's not. It's the result of existing in close proximity with nations in a 300 year political union where we all speak the same language and have a shared culture.

IF you had watched the debate you'd know that that isn't why many of them voted against it.   

There are many reasons why they felt this new law wasn't required:    

 - They were unhappy with the legal protections/wanted more consolation on it (some lawyers have expressed concern that even with the so-called ""quadruple lock"" the courts could challenge it).    
 - Many of them who voted FOR the civil union bill felt that they got double-crossed (since at the time they were assured that the civil union bill was as far as this would go, marriage would remain ""protected""). They are concerned that they might get double-crossed again (that the CoE/religion exemptions might be removed in the future).       
 - Some wanted marriage to remain between a man and a women but wanted to expand civil partnerships to straight couples (for equality, or something).    
 - Some felt that there were more important issues, even in equality (e.g. women in the House of Lords) and that this issue was both unimportant and because it wasn't in a manifesto that it wasn't a democratic change.    
 - Concerns were raised that essentially the law would only change the name of the thing, and needed a lot of work in order to cover historical legal problems (and maybe to automatically convert Civil Unions into Gay Marriages, since Civil Unions were now redundant).    
 - et al    

My point is, that if you watched the debates you might disagree with the opposition to this reform (as I myself do) but you cannot just paint them all with the ""bigot who hates equality"" brush as so many are quick to do.    

Some of them are bigots. Some of them don't care about equality.

What's wrong with a 401(k)? It's a tax efficient way for individuals to save for their retirement. 

Right now people have three options

1) Pay NI and hope the state pension is worth something when they retire

You've got not choice about paying, but you're a fool if you think that you'll get a pension that you can live off. My grandparents did this and got screwed.

2) Work for a company and get a company pension

My parents did this in addition to 1). And they got screwed. My Dad got a pension which was originally like a 401(k) in that both he and his employer paid into it and he could keep the cash at the end. They turned it into a defined benefit pension where they got to keep the cash after he died. Also he got screwed on the amount he ended up getting.

3) Save up cash yourself and live off that. That's what I did because I was always self employed. But I didn't get any tax benefit to doing it.

If we had 401(k)'s in the UK I could have avoided paying tax on my retirement savings and still managed them myself.  Also the government could means test me and decide I didn't need a state pension. Which they'll no doubt do anyway to me, but most people have no savings. If we had a US style 401(k) system where people could save tax free they could do it to more people and thus not go bankrupt. Which, as it is, they will. Which is why you're a fool if you think that the state pension will be worth anything in 20+ year's time.",0,1360094115,null,0,1360094529,0,c89w92i,t3_17xi8o,t1_c89w92i,t1_c89ueij,null,1431201111,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Defoe started the season on a tear, and he's cooled off since. His greatest strength is creating space to shoot in the box, if he can get the ball there that is. Not a great off-the-ball player, not a great passer. It's not like these are deficiencies we didn't know about, but for a while the team seemed to cover for him.

Ade certainly hasn't played spectacularly for us, and I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to injury and playing in a new system. I'm optimistic that he'll do well as a lone striker, but I admit that it's mainly because if he doesn't then we're kind of fucked.

Whilst I think that state sovereignty is a nuanced issue, there are two points I'd like to briefly make.

Firstly, I think it has by now been established as a fact that Scotland is capable of surviving as an independent country  even without an overreliance on a depleting oil supply. Whisky, tourism, renewable energy, computing, (even finance from the hub of Edinburgh, although I admit that world is something of a mystery to me) are big industries capable of supporting a Scottish economy.

Secondly, (and this one is subjective but, I believe, stems from something shared with a lot of Scots) I think that Scotland would be socially better off if independent from the rest of the UK.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;Do you think it's some kind of political machine that will cease to exist in an independent Scotland?

Yes. FPTP, Lords Spiritual, Established Church, Heredity peers, unelected second house, the dogma of centralisation, all the other rubbish, tradition and scraps of history we have enshrined in our system of Government. Gone. 

&gt; Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and all the other shits will still be able to govern Holyrood.

But without the archaic nonsense that is FPTP they would not be given the free reign that, whoever scoops the lucky 35% of the vote required to gain a majority in the commons, allows them to do whatever they damn well want. As it stands we ricochet between the two parties every decade or so, both of whom recklessly try to cram as many of their policies possible in the brief time they have before the other guy gets in. Stability is reduced and the ten years that Party A is out in the cold they have no real input in matters. 

For example, would the UK not be in a better position if a Conservative voice were heard in the height of Labour borrowing? What if a stronger Labour input was there to temper the worst of the NHS reforms and have a more gradual input?

&gt;The point I was making is that over 300 years a British identity has come to exist (despite Salmond and co trying to dispel this).

And this will continue to exist after independence. The British cultural identity is not dependent on 50 MPs being sent south every 4 years. Compare to the Nordic identity. 

&gt;If the UK is outdated, is the concept of a Scottish nation not outdated?

It is the UK constitution that is outdated. 

Although, that said, I would agree with you. I am personally a supporter of a Europe of the regions.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"Scottish here, also voting ""no"".  Here's a TL;DR rundown on some of the reasons:

* The referendum is August 2014, but the actual independence and split is March 2016 if it goes ahead.  That's 18 months of a Westminster and big business scorched earth policy leaving us with absolutely nothing.  You think that *won't* happen?  Joke's on you and I'll buy the next round
* The SNP are continually dodging an array of very important and fundamental unanswered questions, which is very disturbing because it gives the impression that none of them know what they're doing.  Either that or they're misleading the electorate, which is just as bad.  They also seem to be taking an awful lot of things completely for granted as if that couldn't possibly go wrong.  We still don't have any *clear* answers but a whole lot of anti-English propaganda and petty ad hominems which really does come across as ""shun the non believer""
* EU membership.  How in the hell is there so much legal wrangling going on, surely it's ""yes"" or ""no"" as to whether or not we can join?  Also why is there so much debate over joining the Euro?  It's *compulsory* for all new member states, but seeing as a poorly thought out, centrally managed currency forced on 20+ wildly different economies and economic systems hasn't done any harm to Spain or Greece who had stronger economies than we did to begin with then we should join too.  Yes, we should.  I've already started burning my Sterling
* Oil?  It'll run out eventually... that's if we even get to keep it and what use is it if the oil companies decide to leave Aberdeen and operate from London instead?  That's jobs and revenue lost.  Big tax on oil production? More legal wrangling incoming
* Currently, Scottish universities can offer free education to all EU citizens and England/Wales/NI fall into the cracks on this front.  We can't afford to give them free education as well if they're a separate member state of the EU?  As English fees rise to absurd levels more and more English students come north... we can't afford it even now let alone without Westminster funding.
* Yes, we give back more than we get, but without getting anything we *don't have* anything.  Where is this extra money to make us gloriously self-sufficient going to come from?  Scotland has never been hugely wealthy in the first place and our economy is in a sorry, sorry state.  What's even worse is that Salmond's own background is in finance/banking/economics, surely he must have some idea about how fucking stupid this idea is?

I see absolutely no hard evidence convincing me that this is either a) a good idea or b) that it will actually work.  No hard statistics, no financial modelling or projections, nothing.  This isn't about true independence so much as sneering at the English and it says a lot about us as a country that so many people are falling for it.

The only worry I have is that a failure in the referendum might gloss over all the other bad things the Cameron government have done, and plop him back in Downing Street in 2015.  Nobody wants that *either*.

Actually, I just remembered something else.  I'm Scottish but I live in England, I... *can't*... vote on this?!  Yes, let's pollute and fiddle the results by letting English and foreign inhabitants in Scotland vote, but don't let Scottish people elsewhere vote on it?

The problem I have with most of the arguments against equal marriage is that they come across not as evidence-based positions, but excuses. For example, one of the solutions to it being rushed is to discuss it in detail in committee (after second reading). Similarly, the problem as to the precise legal scope can also be dealt with at committee/report, or in the Lords (not that this always works out).

&gt;He basically confirmed himself as a rent boy when he refused to leave last summer because it would involve a wage cut.

* Just because the club wanted to get rid of him they accepted the very first offer they had. since they didnt need him they really did look all that into the offer. Both club reach an agreement but the club couldnt reach one with Malouda. the same thing happen with us and Robinho we reached an agreement with Madrid but we couldnt reach one with Robinho so he ended up going to Manchester. It all part of football it doenst make him arent boy. IMO

&gt; So he chose to stay and rot at in the reserves at Chelsea to make more money even if it meant no first team football.

* He didnt chose to root in the reserve he was placed there by the board without the coach consent. the reason RDM and Rafa didnt recall him is because  if anyone goes against the board decision they automatically get the boot. Example RDM.

&gt;That doesn't reflect particularly well on him as professional IMO.

Yet hardly any of that concerns the SNP.

The same old ""the people of Scotland are best placed to make the decisions about Scotland"" rhetoric is what we hear. Except for when it comes to the EU.

&gt; For example, would the UK not be in a better position if a Conservative voice were heard in the height of Labour borrowing? What if a stronger Labour input was there to temper the worst of the NHS reforms and have a more gradual input?

No. 

&gt; And this will continue to exist after independence. The British cultural identity is not dependent on 50 MPs being sent south every 4 years. Compare to the Nordic identity.

The cultural ties of the UK are just further reason as to why the UK should exist as a nation.

&gt; It is the UK constitution that is outdated.

How so?

Unless you can get a loan which will reduce the overall amount you're going to pay after interest has been taken into account, I wouldn't go down that route.

I would do everything possible to clear the most interest-heavy debt as fast as possible.. which is probably the credit card debt - that ~20% APR is going to kill you. You could look into credit card balance transfers and try to reduce those rates but I imagine you've already done this.

If that means cutting back on everything but essentials for a few months, then so be it. Take a second job if you can, etc. It'll absolutely suck, but the faster you get the high-interest debt down, the faster you can relax and get your finances in order.

Just my opinion, but I imagine someone with more experience can give more detailed advice :)

Well the first point is to equate the SNP with the independence movement. They are a big part, but far from the whole. The second point is what do you mean? The constitution has always been a big part of the debate. 

&gt;The same old ""the people of Scotland are best placed to make the decisions about Scotland"" rhetoric is what we hear. Except for when it comes to the EU.

The EU is currently flexible enough to allow it's constituent parts to, largely speaking, do what they want. In contrast the Scottish Government has no real control over the revenue that it spends because the strings are jealousy held by the ideologically different Government that sits in Westminster. Not all political unions are equal. The UK is famously the example of big, top-down government. The EU is more relaxed. I hope that given lessons learned that an independent Scotland would be more decentralised.

&gt;No. 

No? Oh well then. 

&gt;How so?

The reasons I gave before. 

&gt;FPTP, Lords Spiritual, Established Church, Heredity peers, unelected second house, the dogma of centralisation, all the other rubbish, tradition and scraps of history we have enshrined in our system of Government.

I'll fling the monarchy in there as well this time. 

&gt;You claim to hate Westminster but seem to trust your nations democracy in the hands of Brussels?

Well, the fear is that Brussels turns into Westminster ;-)  
(A eurocrat is just a cheap continental rip-off of the Sir Humphrey). 

That is not yet the case. Even if the EU does fail, I still see Europe becoming a closer political identity through some other means.

true,thepush,null,null,"In Texas, she'd be making $2.15/hr, which is usually just about enough to cover income tax. Her actual paycheck would probably average less than $100 every two weeks. There's a requirement that servers (any tipped employee, really, so sometimes hosts and bussers) be paid back by the establishment if their tips fail to reach minimum wage, but every single restaurant I have worked in (all nationwide chains, all relatively successful, at least one with an average plate price above $15) have been several months, at least, in arrears on those records and payouts.   
  
I'm not going to tell you that she deserved a huge tip. I have no idea of what your definition of ""shitty"" service is. She may have been execrable, or willfully negligent. What I am going to tell you is that, for a lot of this country at least, that tip money is probably her rent, like it was mine. Most of the people I see talking about how they don't want to or like to tip don't seem to understand this fact. You're not giving them ""bonus"" money on top of their wages. Those tips *are* their wages. If you are not tipping her, then you are choosing not to pay her wages for the service she gave you. Again, whether or not she gave you service good enough to have earned those wages is entirely a personal choice on your part - but a lot of people in this country don't understand this choice when they make it, and then they are justified by each other in places like this.  
  
One more thing. The argument ""tipping a bad server only makes them worse"" has always amused me, because in my experience, it's nonsense. I have worked with a lot of servers over multiple years and environments. Some were very good (can't take call tables because his section is already overfilled with them) and some were very bad (cursing at a state trooper). The main thing that causes a server to be good or bad, though, is whether or not they care about their customers. A good server, one who actually cares about his or her customers, may not be perfect - but if they make a mistake, they'll try to resolve it and make sure the customer is happy. A bad server won't bother to do so. If a good server is having a bad day and you get bad service as a result, you tipping them poorly is just going to make it worse, causing their service to degrade even further. If a bad server gives you bad service and you tip them poorly, they will blame you (because you're ""obviously a shitty customer"") and care even less, also degrading their service. If you want to punish a server for bad service, speak to their manager. Your tip - good, bad, or totally lacking - is not going to change the server's ways.

* I don't think Westminster or ""big business"" will enact a ""scorched earth"" policy, no. Do you have some specific examples of what that would mean? In fact David Cameron has promised [additional devolution](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-offers-further-devolution-as-he-rallies-scots-to-defend-union-6989033.html) in some form in the event that Scotland votes no.

* Your array of ""very important and fundamental unanswered questions"" appears to be missing from your post? I'd be interested in seeing some specific examples of ""anti-English propaganda"" from the Scottish Government.

* Prior to the Edinburgh Agreement, the European Commission stated that they would not comment on hypotheticals (since, at that point, a referendum had not yet been acknowledged by the UK). The Edinburgh Agreement establishes the legal basis for the referendum, and so the Scottish Government have asked the European Commission for their opinion.

The EC have stated that they will now offer that opinion, but can only do so if asked by a member state (as that is the only body they can recognise: this is why they could not comment prior to the Edinburgh Agreement).

Scotland is represented within the EU by the UK, however Westminster are currently refusing to request that opinion on the grounds that the referendum will not pass, and therefore there is no need to discuss it. I'm paraphrasing, but you can find some quotes from the Scottish Secretary Michael Moore making this argument to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html).

* Oil is currently [about 15%](http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06292.pdf) of Scotland's economy. Having said that, the North Sea is already divided into areas governed under Scots Law or English Law - the internal subdivision of the UK's maritime boundaries is not in doubt.

* Scotland is likely to follow Ireland in introducing a ""[service charge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-12758097)"" for higher education. That would effectively make higher education free for long-term residents of Scotland, and require payment for everyone else.

* Scotland contributes approximately the same amount to the Treasury as it receives via the annual block grant; money raised in Scotland is generated in the same way it's generated everywhere - via tax. Scotland has some significant export industries (whisky exports were £4.2bn last year), and is almost certainly going to be selling electricity to NI/England (around 25% of the electricity generated in Scotland is already exported; given that we plan to generate 100% of this from renewables by 2020, that is an obvious opportunity).

I'm not sure what hard evidence you are looking for - if you are looking for a cast-iron guarantee that life in Scotland will be better after independence, you will not find it. You won't find one guaranteeing that life will be better as part of the UK either.

I'm also not sure why you believe this is ""sneering at the English""? You must have some examples, surely?

Living in England you won't be eligible to vote, sorry (you can't vote in Scottish local or Parliamentary elections either).

They claim they should own it because the Spanish once had a colony there (which is bollocks, because Spain actually left it to Uruguay). But because the Spanish left and the British stayed, the British retained control. ( I should note the Spanish never technically owned it either, they just also had a small colony there. So did the French!) So Britain just ended up with de-facto control.

They also state that they are closer to the Falklands, therefor they should own the islands. Ridiculous if you ask me.

Now, those two pieces of logic can be applied to some other scenarios...hear me out.
America was colonised by the Spanish, the British, the Dutch and the French. Each colony vied for control but in the end the British won and their colony settled.

Now let's pretend there was no war of independence and the USA **loved** Britain. It loved being a part of it, and was extremely happy being under British rule, even today. **It wanted to remain British**.

*Now* let's imagine if the French came out tomorrow and said, *""We are laying claim to the USA. It's occurred to us that a French colony existed there and we once had claim to a parts of America. You nasty British bastards came and threw us out! We don't care what the modern USA thinks because they are descendants of British colonists, and therefor don't factor into the equasion""*

Not sure what's is confusing about my statements above. If you consult the table you will see that WBA are clearly in 9th place 12 points behind Chelsea. Whether we've dropped points against them or not is somewhat irrelevant, we're still 6 places ahead of them in the table and I doubt they'll be challenging for 3rd or 4th come the end of the season.

As for everyone else beating them quite easily: 

Spurs drew 1-1 with them at home and won 1-0 away to the Hawthorns. (4pts net) 

Everton lost 2-0 at the Hawthorns and beat them 2-1 at home. (3pts net)

Arsenal beat them at the Emirates 2-0 and have yet to play the away fixture. (3pts net)

Nothing is ever a sure thing, but it is not unreasonable to think that we could beat WBA at home in March, esp. without Lukaku available to them and Odemwingie making such a mess of his relationship with Clarkie. Also, their form in general has been abysmal since the turn of the year: L L L D L L. That's 1 pt from a possible 18 and is the worst in the Premier League. They're not playing anywhere near as well as they were at the beginning of the year when we faced them.

If we do win the return fixture, that would leave us with 3pts net against them on the year, keeping us on pace with the rest of the clubs competing for 3rd and 4th place (Spurs, Everton, Arsenal) assuming WBA can at least squeak out a draw at home to Arsenal. Even if Arsenal wins at the Hawthorns, it won't be a disaster because we have a direct 6pt advantage over them having beaten them twice.

You're thinking about this the wrong way, it's not as important whether we drop a few freak points at home to QPR, or away to WBA because other 3rd-6th place teams will have freak results of their own like Arsenal losing 1-0 away to Norwich, and Everton dropping all 3 pts at Reading, or Spurs losing 1-0 at home to Wigan. To some extent these results off-set, and it becomes much more important that we take all three points against those teams that are in direct contention with us for the champions league places. 

What it comes down to is how Spurs, Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea fare against each other. So far, we're bossing it on this front and have won every single match.

In what way do you mean ""signed off""? Do you mean it in the normal sense, of giving the stamp of final approval? If so then the RBS/AMRO deal was actually approved by the UK-wide FSA; the Scottish Government has no ability to approve or deny that kind of merger.

Or did you mean that he wrote him a letter saying the Scottish Government would offer assistance if they could?

You're saying Salmond was personally green lighting the expansion of RBS and it obviously had nothing to do with UK and EU banking law. 

&gt;if not for the Bank of England this country would have sunk into a deeper depression than you could ever imagine.

Most RBS assets and customers - the vast majority in fact - are in England. Even if Scotland was independent it would be in any future English government's interest to protect these customers from liquidation. Furthermore, Scots have been paying into the UK treasury - why wouldn't a Scottish bank be helped by that fund. You do realise that just because it's called the Bank of England doesn't mean it's exclusively for the benefit of England. You do realise that, right?

Tipping in the US is generally based on a percentage and it's fairly common for waitstaff to up sell (especially expensive things like alcohol) in order to increase the bill and therefore their tip.

I've only been to Britain once.  When going to the chain coffee shops I assumed the small service charge (for dine in only) was for the additional cost of dishes/busing since drinks were served in a ceramic mug with a metal spoon and saucer (to-go orders just served it in a paper cup with lid).  I guess I just wasn't used to that.

Personally, I really dislike the obligated tipping like the US.  It only has a negligible affect on service and has other problems like causing prejudice and needless upselling.  I feel bad for both sides; it sucks to rely on tips when you have a bad night and it sucks to feel obligated to tip on bad service because you know they rely on it.  I still tip in the US because of that obligation but I do avoid it where possible (I never get food delivered--I always pick it up).

Marriage isn't a christian institution. All religions that I can think of have a version of marriage and they're all considered equally as valid.

Thought my views might help some of the people here understand what kind of people think same sex marriage is a step backwards, not forwards.

I am against same sex not because I'm a homophobe, I have and know great people who are in gay relationships, but because to me marriage is the foundation of the family, father, mother and their children, this is how it has worked in most cultures for thousands of years. Married couples with kids are 80% more likely to stay together than none married families while we all know the damage divorce does to children, with 70%+ of people in jail come from broken families that grew up with either father or mother absent.

Two people who love each other is awesome, but its something else completely different, and should remain separate. 



 I thought Civil Partnership, that gave gay couples **exactly the same** rights than married couples (with the exception of division of wealth in case of divorce, in my eyes a bonus!) was a healthy balance and most of people were happy, **but politicians, in an effort to divide us** and taking attention away of more important issues, like cutting down HUGE gap, and growing, between the poor and the rich.

Ok, so it seems like Leno is the best of the bunch in your opinion, with Zieler maybe being the best of the rest.

So your info is definitely appreciated, it's helping me to form a little better idea of the keepers.

The one I do want to say though, is that a goalkeeper's passing ability is probably the hardest aspect of their game to assess. It all depends on the system they're in. They may have the passing ability, but their manager may tell them to hoof it up the pitch instead. 

&gt; Overall, for now I think we should stick with Pepe

It pretty much seems like a foregone conclusion that Pepe is gone in the summer, most likely to Atletico Madrid. The only way I can see him staying is if he has a resurgent next couples months and even then it doesn't seem likely.

With Him and Luka, it felt like we had one guy for attack and one for defense, and Scott would be ruthless in the challenge and win the ball back.  This year he doesn't seem to be filling that role as much and is playing more like a box-to-box middie instead of the rock we need him to be.  I don't know if it is AVB not telling Scott to play that position, or if Scott isn't as good at Sandro at it (interesting how they switched spots in the pecking order from last season), but we need Parker to start being that rock for us again.  It will, like the article alludes to, allow the creative midfielders to worry more about creating.

b. That all churches oppose same sex marriage. They don't. In fact the Religious Society of Friends aka Quakers have been at the forefront in advocating for same-sex marriage.

This is bullshit and here's why.

They say that some faiths *might* by law be forced to marry people they don't want to if this bill passes. So instead they want the law to remain the same, a law that makes it *illegal* for faiths to marry gay couples even if they want to recognize that marriage as marriage.

**The law is ALREADY defining marriages for faiths and is ALREADY suppressing the religious freedoms of those faiths at the behest of other faiths.**

But that's ok is it? We are meant to just forget that and look away because they prefer their faiths homophobic unequal view of marriage because they might, just maybe, but probably not at all be forced to treat people equally? Because it's so very clear that gay couples would just *love* to get married in a church that doesn't want them their because they would be just *wonderful*. 

They are children whining about how unfair it will be that they might have done to them what they are already doing to others. It makes me sick. 

Fuck them.

You could argue over whether this is good or bad.  Some may look at it economically, while others may choose to look at how the ratio of home grown players affects the club.  Arsenal and Man U both have many players who are products of their academy, but have had differing levels of success over the past few years.

Until fairly recently the UK was a Christian nation and has been a largely majority Christian nation for well over 1500 years. It still technically is given that 59% of people marked Christian on the 2011 census. So the idea that a democratic nation with this history still has some laws with a basis in Christianity is far from ridiculous, especially since many of our cultural norms have a basis in Christianity even for non-believers (such as myself). 

&gt; This entirely stems from homophobia, religion is a convenient excuse.

No it isn't. Some people just don't feel that gay marriage is right, and many of these people have nothing against homosexuals at all. Even some homosexuals are against it. And regardless, in a free society they are entitled to hold the view that gay marriage is wrong. 

But all this aside, public opinion towards homosexuals has changed dramatically over the course of a century. Back in the 1950's gay men were being locked up or chemically castrated for being gay, and a mere 63 years later the leader of the Conservative party has championed the cause of giving homosexuals the right to marry. That's a huge amount of progress for a political party that was responsible for Section 28 25 years ago.

true,UncleArthur,sussex,East Grinstead,"Not at all. You are absolutely correct. But the idea of gifting to charity is not to save tax per se. Gift Aid does two things:

1. For Basic Rate (20%) taxpayers, it allows the charity to claim the 20% tax that the donor had originally paid on the donation. The donor is still out of pocket for the net (post-tax) donation.
2. For Higher Rate (40%) taxpayers, the tax is shared between the donor and the charity; each getting 20%. The donor will still be out-of-pocket for the net gift.

An example, assuming a gross donation of £1,000:

If Fred is a Basic Rate taxpayer, he makes a gift out of his net income of £800 and the charity gets the tax back, taking the gift up to £1,000. Fred remains out-of-pocket by £800.

If Fred becomes a Higher Rate taxpayer, he donates £800 out of net pay and the charity gets the same amount as before (£1,000). Fred will eventually get a £200 tax ""rebate"" (basically) after submitting his Self Assessment tax return as a reward for gifting to charity. His net cost of the donation has fallen to £600.

(Side note: An Additional Rate taxpayer (paying 50%) would get 30% of the tax back as a rebate, with the original 20% going to the charity.)

The system tries to encourage the wealthy to gift to charity. They will always still be out-of-pocket by the net amount of the gift, after getting their tax rebate. The system is not designed to be used to avoid paying tax and becoming better off as a result. That is what the Cup Trust is doing and it's morally questionable at best; tax evasion (and illegal) at worst.

I hope I explained it okay. It is a bit more complicated than this - with possible extra tax savings for those earning over £100,000 - but it takes me all day to explain the concept to relatively experienced financial advisers when I'm training them to pass their industry exams.

Contractors will enter a low bid and hope to either skimp on the service or exploit holes in the contract to make a profit. If local authority staff have the clout and expertise to hold the contractor down to the terms of the contract then they will often go bankrupt. This causes chaos to the users of the service.

Ambitious managers stake their careers on outsourcing being seen to save money. Retaining expensive staff to oversee the contracts compromises this, so it doesn't happen.

true,ravniel,num11,,"I'm very pleased with most of the signings we've made in the last two-three windows.  We can go further back and talk about Sandro, Parker, etc.  If we're looking to spend modestly and responsibly, we shouldn't be in for the likes of Moutinho or Damiao at all.  That seems to be what you're saying, and it's fair enough.  But if we're *not* going to be in for those sorts of players we need to be casting a wider net for transfers.

I've been banging this drum incessantly around here and I'm sure you're one of the people I've said it to, so I apologize for repeating myself, but where's our scouting?  Look at the list of players we've signed in the last couple windows.  That's a great fucking list, I think almost every player on it was a splendid signing.  But weren't they all incredibly obvious?  Is there a single player on that list whose availability for transfer wasn't widely known and reported?  In fact, is there a single player on that list who wasn't targeted by another major club in England?  Lloris was rumored to be an Arsenal target, I dunno if that's true.  Vertonghen was an Arsenal target for sure.  Dembele was a Man-U target and claimed to have been a Real Madrid target.  Holtby was supposedly a Liverpool and Arsenal target.  Sigurdsson and Dempsey were Liverpool targets for sure.  These were great purchases, and Levy deserves a lot of credit for going to those players and making the club's case.  But they certainly didn't require any kind of exhaustive search.  Then you get into situations like Moutinho and Damiao where we really needed to have a plan B, and we didn't.  Aggressive scouting is what gives you those low-cost options.  Where are we on the Bentekes and Michus of the world?  Those signings tend to blindside all the big clubs, but if we really want to put together a Champions League team on this kind of budget we need to be the exception to that.

You're right, of course, transfers in general are difficult to discuss in an educated way because of all the speculation.  But I think even with the facts we have, we can discern a pattern of very narrow transfer activity where we need to be casting a very *wide* net if frugality is the #1 aim.

The poster I was referring to was UK based as well. They receive at least minimum wage. And actually, so does anyone in the USA. They just don't let on since they couldn't then claim not tipping leads to poverty and guilt people into looking down on people that don't give donations.

&gt;For example, if you go to a coffee shop where the medium size is significantly smaller than elsewhere, it would be reasonable for you to feel annoyed if you didn't realise this before you ordered, despite the company making no claims to give more coffee per serving.

I would say, my mistake, and move on. I wouldn't expect the company to subsidise my bad choice, like I don't expect to have to subsidise a waiters bad career choice.

&gt;Also, regarding your comment about 'health based reasons', you know that's not what I mean.

If it affects everyone why is it used as an argument? If they were a surgeon or pilot then perhaps I would care.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hey guys, instead of downvoting, lets honestly answer - this is a question that's been asked by a lot of people, even non-religious folk, that has to be made absolutely clear instead of tutting loudly.

Okay, to answer your question.

**Imagine a country where you, a heterosexual man (or woman), cannot marry your loved one because the state religion deems it**

That's it.

You might think there's more to it, but that is it.

Let me put this into context, a mere 50 years ago, I (as an ethnic minority) could not legally marry a white woman. A black man could not marry a white woman, regardless of their love for each other, regardless of religion etc. They faced persecution for merely being in a relationship. 

Now, the claim is that religion is under fire if this marriage law passes. 50 years ago it was ""moral decency"", and the same claims were made on religious principles as well. Hopefully 50 years on, we can actually sensibly answer it with ""yes, god that was a quite bad time for human rights wasn't it?""

Now there's lots of hooh-hahing about whether or not this infringes on religious grounds or that it redefines the historical definition of marriage, and as someone who respects freedom of religion, the answer is yes. Yes, the bible does clearly state that marriage is this thing, its not between people of the same gender, but then you have to accept that the bible makes a lot of statements that we ""accept"" as clearly being wrong, e.g. most christians do eat pork. Most christians don't keep women as chattel slaves. Most christians don't trade their daughter for slavery. Most christians don't see human sacrifice of their children as being acceptable substitutes for the slaughter of bulls, and so on. If you don't accept these things selectively, you're gonna have to explain why you do accept the other thing selectively. As for the historical definition of marriage, it has changed so many times and is written and re-written in so many cultures that its really difficult to define if marriage is actually historically between a man and a woman.

And finally, who said that everyone follows the bible? 

I don't. Some people here don't. 

Does that mean we can't marry? Does that mean they can't? It certainly means, by the bible's own rules that I cannot marry someone who's a Christian.",0,1360107100,null,0,false,0,c8a0o8w,t3_17y52b,t1_c8a0o8w,t1_c89vnip,null,1431203259,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Fairwolf,null,null,"&gt;Scotland was allied with France so we could fight England.

Correct. It was a pretty iffy Alliance without much substance however. 

&gt;It's not simply a case of England is the big bad man who came to dinner and stole our land.

So-So point. The English kings had been claiming to be overlords of Scotland ever since the Norman conquest. The Scots didn't like it one bit. Edward I's aggression during the Scottish Succession crisis was based on this claim of 'Overlordship'. The Scots were temporarily forced to accept, but when they rebelled Edward went ballistic and invaded Scotland, starting off the First War of Independence, starting with the Massacre of Berwick-Upon-Tweed, one of the worst massacres in medieval history. 8000+ civilians dead. 

After that it went into the typical retaliation mode until the Stewarts took the English throne as well as the Scottish one. Then the rest of the wars were over politics, rather than nations. 

&gt;When Scotland tried to establish an empire of our own, our merchants and bankers poured so much money into it that our country almost went broke.

Not quite. Evidence shows that the Burghs at the time of the Darien venture were doing very well economically; they were still backwards in terms of technology to England, but it was the various Scottish Lords who went broke. 

&gt;Thus came the act of union.

Which was plain up corruption.

Scotland and England were both plutocracies at the time, which meant that only the rich got the vote; the rich also happened to be in control of the Scottish Government; who then happened to be bribed with Land, Money and Titles in England in exchange for their cooperation. To give the view of the Scottish public opinion of this move; every city in Scotland had rioting for weeks on end until they were forced to disperse. 

No one is suggesting the Union wasn't beneficial to Scotland (Because it certainly was), but if you're going to try and use history to back up your point at least do a -bit- of research. 

&gt;There is no discrimination and cultural butchering in Scotland

There was; mainly instigated by the Stewart Monarchy, all the way back in the 15th century onwards.

&gt; to me marriage is the foundation of the family, father, mother and their children, this is how it has worked in most cultures for thousands of years

Check your Eurocentrism. Indigenous cultures even up to the present day haven't defined marriage in such a way. The nuclear family is not a concrete social structure that humans are bound by some 'human nature' to fall into, it is a socially constructed phenomenon, and can be changed. If you want to try and call it religiously motivated, the Bible doesn't actually define marriage this way, with notable examples of polygamy and basically a lack of rights for the woman in a marriage. This is not how we see marriage today, so marriage has changed; the 'foundation' of man + woman still a recent development, as before it was more 'man dominating woman'.

&gt;Married couples with kids are 80% more likely to stay together than none married families while we all know the damage divorce does to children, with 70%+ of people in jail come from broken families that grew up with either father or mother absent

What does this have to do with same-sex marriage? You say that 'married couples with kids' are more likely to stay together than non-married couples. However, this seems to be an argument **in favour** of same-sex marriage, as you haven't given statistics for married couples without kids, or even non-married couples with children. Besides, while there's still obstacles, gay and lesbian couples can adopt or have their own biological children by other means, so your argument doesn't follow. Neither does your statistic about people in jail coming from broken families. If broken families cause jail sentences, then surely this supports same-sex marriage as children of these families will have two parents. 

Unless of course you were suggesting that a same-sex couple couldn't raise a child as well as a mixed-sex couple? Didn't you say you *weren't* a homophobe?

&gt;I thought Civil Partnership, that gave gay couples exactly the same rights than married couples (with the exception of division of wealth in case of divorce, in my eyes a bonus!) was a healthy balance and most of people were happy, but politicians, in an effort to divide us

You do not get to define what is equality or progress for the LGBT community. They are they minority, and an oppressed one at that, and so they decide what's right for them and what they want to campaign for. Did you not notice the campaign and demonstrations by groups like Stonewall, LGBT activist groups, for the right to marry? 'most people' were not happy within the LGBT community, and they should not have the views of the majority imposed upon them. Politicians are not trying to divide with this legislation, they are trying to do the exact opposite and include a disadvantaged and oppressed group into a system that has neglected them until now. 

&gt;and taking attention away of more important issues, like cutting down HUGE gap, and growing, between the poor and the rich.

A few hours of debate did not stop progress on this, because it can't be solved in two hours debate. My views on the wealth gap aren't important  here, but suffice it to say that it's not going to be fixed while the neoliberal Conservatives are in government.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"Ok, let's take out the US specific part of what I quoted

&gt; * Both socially and economically, teenagers prefer an anything-goes type situation.
&gt;
&gt; * But as these teenagers grow up a bit and enter the job market, they quickly develop progressive economic ideas: perhaps a bit of ""levelling"" seems pretty good when you're staring up the professional ladder from the bottom rung. Meanwhile, their youthful live-and-let-live social philosophy begins to fade.
&gt;
&gt; * In their late 20s, they start making real money. Economic progressivism goes out the window, preferably out the window of a building with a doorman. As the adult mind turns to more material matters, social views don't change that much.
&gt;
&gt; * Finally, after the mid-40s, retirement looms. Our former teenagers check their collective **savings** and think, you know what, let's all get checks from the government. Social views take a hard turn for the more restrictive. At the end of the journey, economic and social views are again in agreement—only this time on the other side of the philosophical line!

There. And it still applies to UK because whether your savings are in a 401(k), or in stocks or shares or property or whatever what matters is whether or not you can live off them. And most people realise in their 40's that they cannot.

I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make to be honest. I think you dislike what I'm saying because you are young and left wing and don't like people telling you that as you grow up your politics will likely change because that implies that you believe the things you believe because of a lack of life experience rather than the absolute truth you no doubt believe they are. But you can't really argue with that so instead you're nitpicking about describing savings as 401(k). 

You know there's a [great website](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=401k+wiki) where you can read up on what 401(k) means and deduce that it is a US specific way of saying ""savings"".

As for the indigineous gays and lesbians. What does this whole ""marriage"" thing give over a ""civil partnership""? 

Personally I think get rid of all religious based marriages endorsed by the state, and everyone gets a stab at making a Civil Partnership. I don't care if the people involved fuck or bugger each other. They are merely sharing a life together in harmony and trust in each other so much that they wish to share all finances, and take advantage of all insurances, etc with each other. Why should the fact they are a traditional man and wife, or a pair of homo's matter. Why not some good buddies in a batchelor pad? ... and the old spinster Maiden Aunts I aluded to before? I think it is extremely cruel in the old girls case that the surviving sister of the pair is taken to the cleaners on the death of her sistor for Capital Gains Tax, etc, while a couple of homos can just fuck each other up the arse and get tax advantages that she can't.

The answer is any pair of people should be allowed to have a Civil Partnership which is allowed in law as a simple contract. Fucking and Buggering is not needed. The state should not get involved in bizzarre religious ceremonies and shit - leave that to the partners to choose as they wish, but they are meaningless in the courts as far as I am concerned.",0,1360111166,null,0,false,0,c8a1zer,t3_17y52b,t1_c8a1zer,t1_c8a1oyq,null,1431203876,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As such you can end up with a complicated series of overlapping laws - something might be legal in Scotland, unrecognised by the UK, recognised by the ECHR, etc (or the reverse: Scotland's smoking ban was introduced a year before England - so the same action was legal in one country but not in another).

What you really need to be careful of is lying to customers. If someone turns round and questions what you are telling them, and find out it is false information, you will absolutely be the scapegoat, and management will never recall telling you what to say. Your co-workers will likely not support you because they don't want to risk their jobs.

If it was me in your position I would just tell customers the truth. If you get disciplined and ultimately sacked because of this, you could likely take them to a tribunal and clean up. What you have to consider though is that you would need to be absolutely 100% certain they do not use all of this money for the benefit of employee's.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; The Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on 5 December 2005, enabling same sex couples for the first time to enter into a legal commitment broadly equivalent to marriage.

&gt;However, on the same date, an exemption was created to allow employers and pension schemes to exclude civil partners from spousal benefits attributable to employment prior to the above-mentioned date. This exemption is now contained in paragraph 18(1) of schedule 9 of the Equality Act 2010.

&gt;In other words, the law currently allows occupational pension schemes to disregard pension benefits (other than guaranteed minimum pension benefits) earned before 5 December 2005 when assessing what should be paid on the death of a worker to that person’s surviving civil partner.

&gt;Although some pension schemes have voluntarily decided to go further than this and include pre-December 2005 benefits when assessing a surviving civil partner's entitlement to such benefits, many schemes have simply adopted the minimum legal position.

&gt;However, the Government has stated in its consultation paper on equal civil marriages that survivor benefits in occupational pension schemes is an area that needs further consideration.

&gt;It said that the Department for Work and Pensions is considering whether the law (which only requires equality from 2005) should be retained and the impact of its removal or modification.

&gt;Let's hope that ministers do take this opportunity to clarify this area because it appears that this is yet another area of potential discrimination employers and private pension schemes may need to address.

Honestly I agree with you about marriage, but just because I don't want one doesn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed them. Many LGBT people of faith want to get married. I don't know why, but I know that it is wrong to tell them they can't because they have the same genitals. 

I don't see any problem with allowing straight people to have civil partnerships, but the Tories using this as a defence is like someone from the KKK moaning about the black people not letting them drink from the 'blacks only' water fountain.

Let's take for an example: September 1, 1939 - the start of WWII.  Google says it was a Friday.

Using this calendar:

1.. Locate the first two digits of your selected year on one of the corner dials.  ""19"" -

lower right.  

Edit: What did this do for me?  If I am then searching for the last 2 digits of my year only in the 3 or 4 circles that are in this corner of the calendar, then great - but if I'm supposed to check for Jan and Feb on the left, then I've gone away from this corner of the calendar, so ... why?

2.. Locate the second two digits on the center orbit (paying attention to the month during which your date falls - January and February on the left, months after February on the right) and match the quadrant.  Note the letter.  - ""39"" and September (which means I want one on the right?)  

39 is in the 6th circle counting clockwise from the top, the lower right of the circle, corresponding with ""A"" (though, I should note: 50 is directly between A and C, so I don't know what I would do if my year was 1950)


3.. Next, after noting the color of the month in which your date falls, find the correct day of the month on the small dials and match the color.  Note the letter.

September is Chris Eccelston, which is a blue (not purple) - 01 corresponds with ""M""

4..  Match the year and date letters on the center wheel to find the day of the week.

A and M ...  I don't see any rational way in which A and M lead you to think the answer is ""Friday"".  

I understand that making a calendar that allows for this many combinations is not an easy task, so it needs to be somewhat complicated, but this is so overly convoluted as to be completely confusing.  Add in the fact that I don't even see evidence that it WORKS, and it becomes totally worthless.

I would NOT recommend starting with Season 5.

By Season 5, it's assumed you know the basics.  Plus, personally, the show (and the Doctor) is much better in the first 4 seasons - especially David Tennant's Doctor.  Season 1 was pretty low budget, but had some decent story lines and some segments of dialogue that REALLY hit it out of the park.

You know, Pertwee was really the best. I mean let's look at his time on doctor who. 

1. He was great at Venusian aikido and sword fights too. 

2. The best Master. Roger Delgado and Jon Pertwee had such an awesome chemistry! 

3. Unarguably the best companions/Characters. i mean come on! We got Sarah Jane, Jo Grant, Sergeant Benton, Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, Liz Shaw. None of that Amy/Rory/Clara bullshit characters. 

4. Awesome fight scenes. 

5. Awesome stories. 

6. Awesome Doctor. 

The only doctor who even comes close to the awesomeness of the Third Doctor is Tom Baker and maybe David Tennant on a lesser extent.

My opinion, obviously. Probably going to get downvoted anyways.

&gt;How does a guest rip off the server?

You ran pubs for 20 years and you don't understand this?

Big groups are a giant hassle, tend to stay longer, tend to require more work even than the equivalent number of people at smaller tables, and so forth. At the same time, a lot of people look at a $400 bill for the table and think, '15%? Of THAT? Fuck that!' and tip $20 or something. It's not just a problem, it's a very common problem at places with frequent large groups. The reason they tack on the 18% service charge for big groups is because otherwise waitstaff have to hustle really hard for a table of ten or twenty or whatever, for two or three hours, and then get jack shit.

&gt; No. If my experience is awful, no tip. (gotta be pretty bad).

Yes, that's what he said. If your experience is awful, then you have the right to bring up the 18% gratuity and get it removed from your bill.

As for the rest of what you said, I don't understand it at all. At least in the States, if there is an 18% gratuity added to someone's bill, then the server who worked that table gets that money. They might have to cash out some to the kitchen and/or the bus-persons/maitre d'/whatever, but they keep the lion's share. It's not split evenly between all the waitstaff or anything like that.

I mean, I'm sure there are places where things like that happens, but it's pretty rare, and it certainly isn't legal. In the US, 'tip' and 'gratuity' and even the automatic '18% service charge' have a specific meaning, and the server has to pay taxes on the money from his or her tables come tax time (and the accounting for that is strictly regulated), so if the restaurant is taking that money, then the server is paying taxes on money that he or she never got. Which would seem problematic to me, at the very least...

The truth about it is this, moffet sucks at longevity and creativity. Using the ""doctor who"" idea lacks imagination. The river song character was put together poorly and appears to be used as a scapegoat when the writers back themselves into a corner that can't be explained and we have to leave it to magic at the end of every season by moffet.

The doctor gets wiped out of time by sacrificing himself to save the universe, river shows up with a diary and Amy wishes him back into existence.

The doctor sacrifices himself ""again"" to save the universe. River shows up to explain that really the fixed point in time wasn't a fixed point because the doctor was able to trick the universe by hiding in a machine. And now must hide.

This season will probably end similar to this, the doctor sacrifices himself to end whatever bs time lapse of the new companion showing up everywhere in time, and just when fans think its all over river shows up with a soufflé or a bow tie and boom the doctor is back.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"What I find strange is that your position is considered to be gaining perfect equality. All people wanting a legally recognised opposite-sex partnership without wanting to commit to social expectations of marriage - focus on children, monogamy, &amp;c. - have been denied the ""right"" to have a civil partnership.

This inequality is not being corrected. Nor does it seem anyone is arguing for that correction which is such an obvious inequality within the framework being discussed that it's omission really stands out. Why is that?

Couples of opposite sex who wished to have a civil partnership are still excluded from civil-partner pension benefits.

Now that the Commons have decided that marriage is to be dissociated from family life and is no longer to be supported for any [perceived or actual] benefits towards societal support of parents there seems to be no logical reason to exclude any pairing from (or perhaps group) from marriage.

""Marriage"" within families should now also be allowed as the incest argument (that procreation within families should be avoided) is no longer valid if marriage is no-longer to have any [or at least a central] element of supporting and affirming parents. IMO the government can't logically stop at this position unless the reason for the bill is to simply punish those who hold marriage in high regard and adhere to the traditional family unit as a basis for building a properly functioning society. 

Now assuming this to be ratified there appears no argument against any form of partnership coming under the governments legal definition of marriage. That would IMO have to include partnerships with no element of sexual relationship and for any reason limited only by the conscience of the parties involved. Multiple partners of any configuration should be recognised.

Of course this won't happen because no one is pushing this on the basis of true equality: if that were the actual aim the very simple action would have been to say ""this government will no longer care if anyone is married"" and drop all government activity as it relates to marriage.

Un-consummated marriages can be annulled because the view of marriage in law was established such that unless procreation were to be attempted the marriage is null, has no purpose. That is an unconsummated marriage is no marriage at all, if the couple don't intend to conceive and raise children together then it's deficient.

Clearly now marriage is to be re-defined in these new certain terms procreation is to be excluded as an issue. The only consistent way to follow through is to remove the need for consummation as an element of marriage, opposite sex couples can't consummate a marriage. The conclusion then is that sexual behaviour is not an element of marriage either. Anyone surely should then be allowed to ""marry"" anyone else of any age. Moreover why should there be a prohibition under such a regime to recognising multiple partnerships; the only reason I see are financial (ie you share your partnership right to pension with the 50 members of your family you're ""married"" to, if you die then the pension company is getting a big bill [or just definitely getting a bill] if they didn't carefully allow for this situation in their contracts).

My family also tell racist/otherwise socially unacceptable jokes, not because they believe them but for the shock factor and because they are genuinely funny. 
My mother also thinks it's funny to flash us of she's just walking around in her dressing gown.

And it never happens. Now Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can do pretty much all the things the various articles over the years have mentioned.  It's also very resource intensive and whilst there are dedicated carrier grade routers than can do DPI they can't actually deal with as many connections as they can with DPI off.

ISP's are as cheap as all get out and if they could get awaywith tin cans and string for their core infrastructure they'd do it so they never have the DPI capacity to do EVERYONE, just the people who've either had a (C) notice against them, are already being watched by plod/MIx or similar reasons.

Mix that with the expectations and irrational beliefs that come with being a 22 year old professional football player on the world stage and yes that will have a profound effect on an individual. 

I definitely believe, like Cassano, Balotelli will grow with age and experience. Also add the the right mentor and he is no different from our asses sitting on the computer. Mario is a human and like all of us he needs time to develop fully.

AVB seems to prefers Sandro/Parker to cover more ground on the pitch. 

I reckon this is partly down to tactics. AVB prefers to midfield to be dynamic and swap attacking/defensive roles when the situation requires, possibly to make them harder to mark and to keep the opposition guessing.

However the main factor is probably Dembélé. He is much more capable than Modrić when defending due to his tackling ability and strength and so can drop back to fill in for Sandro/Parker seamlessly if they decide to burst forward to support an attack. This results in the holding midfielder having a more box-to-box role rather than just screening the defence, much like Parker did at West Ham.

I may be wrong but none of us would question Dembélés dynamism, flexibility and all around play that he brings to our team.

true,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"I'm not really up for this at all but I gotta say if we do get him our dribbles stat is going to break new ground.
Hatem is currently listed as the most frequent dribbler in the league with 8.7 per game. We already have Suarez and Sterling on there at 2nd and 4th, with 8.4 and 5.3 respectively. Sterling has also played some 500 more minutes of football than Ben Arfa.

Although his return of 3 goals and 2 assists from 13 games is very underwhelming.

In fact during the 13 league games he's appeared in this season Newcastle have scored only 14 goals, that's 1.07 per game, and while you can say he's contributed in about 40% of those goals, when he's not on the pitch Newcastle average, 1.58 goals per game. They scored 19 in the 12 games he has missed.

I can't help but think Ben Arfa is a bit of a luxury player, all flair and very little substance, Adel Taarabt has very similar numbers tbh. Ben Arfa also has a history of refusing to return to his club after breakdowns in relationship and has on two separate occasions confirmed he won't return to train with his club in order to force through moves to other clubs.
That just sounds like a massive risk for us to take, and considering the amount of youngsters we have already queued up to play in that position there is simply no need to buy this guy.

After a few years there, the bonuses dwindled away to almost nothing, and the regular pay started decreasing too. Shortly before I quit, we had an extremely busy month with everyone noticing larger tips than usual. The owner's house flooded that month and he had recently started a new business, and we were all outraged to see that the ""bonuses"" were lower than ever.

So basically it's a ploy to control as much money as possible, and keep whatever expenses he needed to cover, all while calling it bonus money that he considered a favor instead of earned wages.

All that said, I think adding gratuity charges to the price of your food is in theory a great idea. Not as a % charge added to your bill, but just charge a little more for food and pay staff a decent wage. Then it's not up to the patrons to help employees pay their bills, but still an option for good service.

true,Draxton,null,null,"&gt;Marriage as it stands has an assumption of consummation just as it has an assumption of the raising of children under the care of a fixed (for life) pairing of adults.

Whose assumption? Your assumption?

&gt;Un-consummated marriages can be annulled because the view of marriage in law was established such that unless procreation were to be attempted the marriage is null, has no purpose. That is an unconsummated marriage is no marriage at all, if the couple don't intend to conceive and raise children together then it's deficient.

""If you don't want children, your marriage is deficient""? What a negative view of it. I'm glad you are not responsible for defining what is a marriage. That two people do not want children in no way makes their marriage ""deficient"".

If the law says ""you **must** consummate your marriage for it to be official"", then what law? That it can be voided (not annulled, there's a difference) on grounds of lack of consummation does not mean consummation is a requirement. As has been raised in this thread, the law (if passed) will remove any consummation requirement from same sex couples, making the argument null anyway.

The rest is just tin hat. 'Marriage' is just the legal joining of two people, currently of opposite sexes. You may have this notion of romance and love and consummation, but the reality is I, a male, could grab any consenting random woman and marry her in a registrar's office as long as we can drum up some witnesses and she is of legal age. We would not be obligated to have children, or even have sex. But in the law, we'd be married. You're free to disagree with that on moral grounds, but that doesn't alter it.

I know nobody who is unemployed other than by choice (both myself, and my wife's friendship groups), or nobody who has been made unemployed due to austerity. We both graduated in the middle of it, and found jobs well before graduation. Sure, things are difficult but after 300+ applications something came up for both of us. My friends all bitch about the 'difficult times' but we all work. I unexpectedly lost my job in October 2011, I was in a new one by November.

As for austerity measures - the small things in place won't make things any better or worse for young people. Tuition fees are a bit shitty, but then maybe it will place a real value on higher education and force people to demand more of their courses (my course had maybe 6 hours a week - by Monday mid-morning I've spent more time at my desk). 

IMO - the austerity (which is incredibly mild, and isn't really austerity) measures should have, in practice, stabilised our economy around a stormy sea of crap that has come at us in the form of continued global instability. Now don't get me wrong - I'm no fan of Dave anymore (my first job was working for one of his MP's). I genuinely thought that they would be sorting out the UK for the long term after the crap Labour left us.  Turns out, we are still spending too much. Do you think there is an endless money fountain that politicians can chuck at you? The bill will be due sometime. Whether it's next time you go to a PFI paid hospital and find it's some middle manager who has no medical training bandaging you  up because the hospital has more managers than beds, or when the fact that the only jobs being created during boom years are bureaucratic institutions of the Government which suddenly can't pay you.

The main reason austerity isn't working is that there has been no austerity. Although, the 'tough talk' has done miracles for the market. The pound is still a safe haven, people invest in the UK, and the jobs market, whilst tough - is nowhere near the 50%+ unemployment many of our European neighbors have. (Spain, Italy, France - not Germany).

One day, people will have to wake up and smell the coffee. Our budget still isn't balanced and won't be this Parliament. If we don't sort it out, the UK will end up like Greece in the coming decades.

Edit: downvote brigade, please show me where the magical money-shitting government tree is.

true,Xuth,null,null,"Ok - deep breath! You'll be absolutely fine. Us Brits may be a sardonic, sarcastic bunch - but we're also a welcoming lot. 

I'm not from Northants myself, but from it's neighbouring county Bedfordshire. I'd say that house prices are fairly similar, and wages too. 

You're moving to quite a small, sleepy ruralish town. The pace of life won't be too slow though, as it forms part of the larger London commuter belt and you'll have ready access to Cambridge, Northampton and even Birmingham if you fancy a drive. 

As a general rule - the closer to London you are the more expensive housing gets. That said, you should be able to get a two bed house for around £550pcm upwards. (Having just looked at rental properties in Burton Latimer I can confirm that's about right there). These properties will be decent little places - perhaps a little pokier than you'd be used to in the States for the same price, but certainly not a dump. Landlords in market towns like Burton will know to keep it tidy.

You then need to factor on things like council tax (For Burton Latmier it'll be £955 per year for a Band-A house, but there are subsidies for families I believe). Water bills are around £20-30 a month, electricity will be roughly the same although will obviously be less in the summer. Internet, line rental and TV access depends on what you want out of it - but a low end package would be around £20, with a huge all inclusive cable/satellite pack with fibre optic hitting £100. If you want to keep costs down you can get an internet package for about £15 and use freesat or Freeview - about 30 channels absolutely free including all the BBC stuff. You'll be able to get a mobile contract and a phone for £15 or so. 

Income will depend on how many shifts you get obviously. But a friend of mine who works at Starbucks says he gets around £8,023 - £15,224	after tax per year. I live a fairly comfortable life on my poultry £12,500 so I imagine a shared income with your BF will be absolutely fine. And (I dont mean to be patronising as I know a lot of people have a lot of different views on this) healthcare isn't a factor at least! 

We don't have any issue with Americans really. The only time I've been annoyed by your countrymen is the completely obvious LOUD tourist type in London. Frankly people around the 'shire' counties won't encounter many on a day to day basis so it won't present any issue as far as I'm aware. There will probably be curiosity when people you're introduced to hear your accent - but people in shops, customers in Starbucks and people who are just going about their business won't even flinch. If I hear someone with a North American accent I tend not to even think about it consciously. Brits are very used to, and accommodating to,... how do I put this without coming across as a dick... familiar looking, English speaking people. A bit glib I suppose, but hundreds of thousands of Irish, Australians, Canadians and Americans live and work here without so much of an eyelid being batted - you're the invisible minority which means people won't even notice you're an outsider unless you happen to speak for a while. We're used to it and our cultures cross-over easily and we can understand the accents without a thought. I grew up around several Americans (due to the large population stationed at a USAF base here) and there was never a thought of 'Oh, you're different!'. 

I'd say that loudness is the main gripe against Americans - but I know it's also not universal. If you've been around Brits for a while, you'll know the right volume to stay at ;). 

This has turned into a bit of a long reply which I didn't expect! But I hope it's helped you somewhat. You shouldn't worry about being judged at all. It'll take a little while to adjust to a new country but we're not all that different from the US! 

One final thing: drink tea with milk! 

Best of luck to you. If there's anything you feel i've missed or that you'd like elaborating more please feel free to ask! I'm at work so I rushed through this a bit...

Those are important as they're so-called 'grounds for divorce' that permit a divorce or an annulment. So technically there is something to be discussed there if 'gay divorce rights' are to be the same as everyone else's.

But that's the point of amendments and of committee stages, and failing that, the judiciary. Let's get gay marriage sorted before we get worried about gay divorce! 

(And besides, most divorces are done on grounds of 'circumstances' these days, which can easily be legally used by a gay married couple who wish to divorce because one of them was unfaithful - one bizarre footnote to all this is that in a current straight marriage, it's never legally counted as adultery if a man has sex with another man.)",0,1360145758,null,0,false,0,c8aacon,t3_17y52b,t1_c8aacon,t1_c89zwfz,null,1431207908,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

1) Emenalo has done *significantly* better with our youth system than Arensen *ever* did (and he was supposedly the genius).

2) Torres was not his decision.

3) Sturridge didn't fit Chelsea. He is a 2-man frontline player, and we haven't played that way since Hasselbaink and Guddy. We played him on the wing, and that was wrong.

4) The contract policy for 30+ year old players is not something that only Chelsea does, and with FFP coming into play, its something that makes an immense amount of sense. Why pay a 34 year old player 150k a week for more than one season when he cannot produce the consistency (athletically) of a 25 year old making 80k? The contract debate is not Chelsea not offering Lamps a deal, its Lamps being stubborn about its contents. Love the man, hope and pray he stays, but not for 150k a week.

5) Drogba was leaving if we won the Champions League no matter what. And further, as evidenced by him snubbing us for Galatasary when we chased him, really had no intention on returning on anything more than a bit part loan. 

Most of what you mentioned is not Emenalo. Further, he has greatly improved our youth system, more so than the fucking massive mistake we made with Arsensen that left us with a huge contract for a terrible Tech Director and the whole Kakuta incident.

If so, that doesn't make sense given that Matt Smith's Doctor has verbally stated that he is the 11th incarnation of himself. That on top of the various montages of the Doctor's faces we've seen (like the encounter with the Atraxi). You can't just place Hugh Laurie between Paul McGann and Christopher Eccleston as... I guess that would make him the 8.5th Doctor? It wouldn't make sense. In terms of events in this hypothetical movie, they'd have to cover McGann's regeneration into Laurie, and then get to Laurie's regeneration into Eccleston too. It seems extremely unnecessary even if they *could* force it to make sense.

I would rather they make another special with Paul McGann, but make the whole thing good this time instead of just his performance. Have him explain away the ""half human"" thing from his last movie (just to get rid of it), live out the time war, and then regenerate into Eccleston as a direct result of it. I don't even think it would have to be a movie, a 90 minute TV special would probably be enough. That's *if* they ever even cover the Time War at all. Personally, I think it's too risky of a move. I think they're better off referencing it every so often with maybe occasional flashbacks *at most*. It's one of those things where I don't think the reality of it could ever top people's expectations.

You may find a cheaper ticket using their software, but you can buy any UK rail ticket through any UK rail operator or at any train station.

My personal favourite is East Coast's website - http://eastcoast.co.uk - but it really doesn't matter which you use - they all sell the same tickets and thetrainline is one of very few that charges booking fees as mentioned by Girlwithnousername.

If you are ever in doubt, go to a manned ticket office and purchase your ticket there. Rail tickets in the UK are very misleading and often people will purchase a ticket that is not right for them, or is more expensive than a ticket they could have also used.

National Rail Enquiries are also not likely to show you the cheapest ticket for your journey - most usually simply the cheapest ticket from starting station to end station as calculated by their software - and not using a particularly intelligent algorithm. This can often by the simplest ticket to buy, but it is almost certainly not the cheapest for a longer journey.

Train tickets in the UK are an absolute mess, if you use the train with any regularity then you will probably be shocked by how much you can save with a little research and effort.

Of course not. Nevertheless, I think it would be entirely appropriate for any candidate to declare their membership of any campaigning organisation -- so the voters can decide.

And yet it is backed up by lots of data. Which is more than you can say. Also there are plausible theories to explain why the data look the way they do. Which, once again, is more than you can say.

Look at the size of the sample

http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-democrats-are-doomed-or-how-a-big-tent-can-be-too-big/

&gt; Articles noting this phenomenon anecdotally appear all the time, and despite the recent hopeful spate of Democratic victories, it's undeniable that the Republicans form an exceptionally effective opposition party. Today, we're going to perform a data-driven investigation of why this might be—and discover some fascinating things about the American electorate along the way. Our data set for this post is 172,853 people.

&gt; That may be young for you, if you're describing mid 40s as having retirement looming you're definitely not of my generation, so either old enough to be in that lucky position, or too young to know anything.

**********

Actually if you look at the data the switches happen (as I mentioned) 

&gt; Most people are left wing up to about 30
&gt;
&gt; From 31 to 51 they tend to be right wing
&gt;
&gt; After that it wobbles around between the two.

So it's more like ""51"" than ""mid 40's"". Of course as you have pointed out this is US data and the cutover points won't happen in the same places in the UK. But I bet the UK electorate would have cutovers too.

http://www.britishpollingcouncil.org/nick-moon.pdf

&gt; As far as age is concerned there were much more dramatic differences. Both the 
pollsters told the same story here, with almost identical figures throughout. The most 
striking age difference was the far higher level of support for the Conservatives amongst 
the older age group. Two in five of the over 65’s said they would vote Conservatives, 
where as only one in four of the under 34’s said they would do so. The 35 to 64 year 
olds were more likely to vote Conservative than the younger respondents, but not nearly 
so likely as the over 65’s. 
&gt;
&gt; By contrast, Labours vote was almost equal across the age groups. It was slightly lower 
among 65+ but the difference was not big enough to be statistically significant. 
&gt;
&gt; Support for the Lib Dem’s was much lower among the older respondents than younger 
ones. Whereas one in four of 18-34 year olds said they would vote Liberal democrats, 
only one in five of those aged 65+ did so. 

It's worth pointing out that this based on 2005 election which Labour won. I remember back in days when Old Labour lost elections the Conservatives did better in the general population and the age split in their support was more pronounced. 

That explains these opinion poll results for /r/ukpolitics which showed - compared to an opinion poll of the general UK population more Lib Dems and fewer Conservatives.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/15olqa/rukpolitics_opinion_poll/c7oqg0x

&gt; Look at the Greens. They are 15% of /r/ukpolitics and 1% of the general population
&gt;
&gt; Lib Dems are 17% of /r/ukpolitics and 10% of the population
&gt;
&gt; Conservatives are 11% of /r/ukpolitics and 33% of the UK population.
&gt;

Indeed it is very reminiscent of Churchill's possibly apocryphal quip ""If you're not a liberal at twenty you have no heart, if you're not a conservative at forty you have no brain""

I.e. the theory that young people tend to be left wing and old people tend to be right wing - at least until they realise that they need the government to fund their retirement because they have no savings - is backed up by a lot of data. It's not a US specific phenomenon by any means. I'd expect it to be repeated in any country where the left wing party is in favour of high taxes and high benefits. It also neatly explains why right wing parties tend to be socially conservative and whilst they tend to oppose benefits to working age people they do not oppose pensions to retired ones.

This part of the bill is rather silly in my opinion (not that I disagree with the rest of what you said).  As I understand it, consummation specifically requires penis-in-vagina sex.  However, many married couples in which at least one person has a disability or medical condition, is very elderly, or is intersex or transgender or asexual, will never perform this sex act.  A minority of same-gender married couples (involving a trans or intersex person) will.  To me, the obvious thing to do is to take consummation out of the law.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Interesting questions! While we may be able to defeat them militarily, what do you think the long term implications of such a move would be?

If you go over to /r/argentina and look at past threads about the Falklands/Malvinas, you'll find that most people don't really give a shit about the islands, certainly not enough to want to go to war over them. If they were to launch a military offensive on the islands, it certainly wouldn't be with majority public support.

The UK could probably push back that force quite easily on our own. The world would see it as self-defence and we would have 100% backing from the UN, our allies and our own population. It would be a huge win for whoever is in UK government at the time and probably a nice moral (and maybe economic?) boost for us too. Argentina would stop the offensive and their war-mongering government would probably be kicked out for forcing them to re-live a terrible part of their history.

*But if we then started invading their homeland, it would be a completely different story.*

Let me remind you that Argentina is a **big** country. Not really population wise (42 million), but area wise. Much bigger than us and much bigger than another relevant country with a name beginning with ""I"" and ending with ""raq"" (population 31 million).

That country was seen as a threat so a military force much bigger than ours (and including some of ours) invaded it to remove the crazy leader and stop them from being trouble in the future. Let's not debate about whether or not that invasion was ""legal"" or ""morally correct"" right now. It happened, the ""conventional war"" part of it was over pretty quickly. But then the ""guerrilla war"" began and here we are, 10 years down the line and shit is *still* fucked up over there.

Do we really want to do that all over again but with:

* a bigger country
* more people to fight against
* a battleground *very* far away
* more international support for them (the south american block, while not so powerful militarily, is powerful economically)
* less international support for us (the yanks have been reluctant to take a solid side on the matter and may see it as ""not their fight"" while France is busy in Mali)
* our own military possibly still already engaged in other conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan

While we may ""succeed"" in winning the conventional war, there is no way we could maintain order in such a huge country with so many people who, at this point, would hate us - the occupying force - with a vengeance.

We would go from righteous-defender-of-our people to international-bully in world public opinion and possibly be derided even more than the yanks around the world.

Our own public will be tired of losing our sons and daughters in a country so very far, far away for a morally questionable war.

Our public debt would be worse than now, having been forced into a war with an already struggling economy and no ""total victory"" in sight.

People will ask us, *what was it for?*

*To stop a WMD threat?* No, Argentina has none of these.

*To stop an invasion of our land?* No, the Falklands will already be safe before we invade their homeland.

*For money?* Invading Argentina would probably cost a lot of money.

*For Freedom?* Don't make me laugh.

true,roomyn,null,null,"&gt; It all seems much ado about nothing to me - I mean ""Civil Partnerships"" are already the de-facto gay marriage thing. This just seems to add some kind of religious nonsense to it?

Most marriage ceremonies in the UK are not religious.  This bill does allow religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, but also also allows civil ones.  There are a number of legal differences between civil partnerships and marriages (though immigration is not one of them, so your paranoia about illegal immigration is misplaced), which generally put civil partners in a worse position than married couples.  But the main difference is symbolic, and is important for two reasons:

* calling them ""civil partnerships"" instead of ""marriages"" reinforces the idea that same-sex relationships are inferior to opposite-sex ones.  I have heard people in civil partnerships talk about times when they introduced their partner to someone as their ""husband"" or ""wife"", only to be lectured that they aren't ""really"" married and shouldn't pretend that they are.
* children are raised with the idea that they will be married one day, and that this will be an extremely important and joyous occasion.  I was a teenager when civil partnership was introduced, and I remember watching the news reports and realising for the first time (hopefully wrongly) that there was no chance I would ever get married.  It made me feel really fucking horrible about myself.

After the recent US election, many in the media (especially in the UK) wanted to pin Romney's loss on social issues; based on the fact that the Obama campaign attacked him as a woman-hating, gay-bashing, anti-abortion nutjob.

But that was nothing new; Democrats attack every republican in those terms. The reason Romney lost is quite simple; he didn't excite the base *enough*, and his 'get out the vote' strategy was a complete cluster fuck. 

The Obama team had ex-facebook, super-smart computer nerds coming up with cutting edge GOTT systems; real time tracking and canvassing, harassing people via FB, donating via one-click, all kinds of effective stuff. The republicans had pen and paper, and an online system that crashed  on vote day. 

After the result, Osbourne and co looked at this, and thought everything could be tracked back to policy; specifically the social issues. They thought the US was just like the UK, and that the Tories better get gay happy before they lose the next election based on that. 

In my opinion, nothing could be further from the truth, and this may ironically cost the Tories dearly at the next election (based on the pissed off base). So in reality, we have the fucking up of Team Romney, and/or the smartness of Team Obama, to thank.

Indeed, the point is not 'therefore it's acceptable', the point is 'if you're going to point fingers over individual incidents, everyone can point fingers at everyone else'. Therefore, if this were normal, regular policy for Israel, it would carry more weight that simply stating that one time, they did X.

&gt;Essentially groups that inform their political views within the chamber. 

As I stated, If I'm a member of Greenpeace, they don't necessarily influence my views or how I vote. How would you work out if this was the case? Otherwise, you're being presumptive by assuming that membership = policy influence. Being a member of a group doesn't automatically make you a lobbyist for them.

&gt;Welcome to democracy?

Welcome to the KGB, more like - at which point does the intrusion stop when it's based on a mere possibility? If you were a member of 'friends of Uganda', because you wanted to do something about their anti-gay laws that keep being posited, would you mind someone assuming you were actually in favour of those laws just because of your membership?

Sure?

&gt;Therefore, if this were normal, regular policy for Israel, it would carry more weight that simply stating that one time, they did X.

You mean like Mordechai Vanunu, who was lured to Italy, then drugged and kidnapped? Or Imad Hassan Atwi, a Lebanese sheepherder who was kidnapped because...who knows? It's not just an isolated incident. 

&gt;As I stated, I'm a member of Greenpeace, but they don't necessarily influence my views or how I vote. How would you work out if this was the case?

You can vote for whoever you like. Such is democracy.

&gt;Being a member of a group doesn't automatically make you a lobbyist for them.

Which is hard to judge when the groups are, by their nature, secret. Something called 'Friends of Israel' is clearly concerned with Israeli issues. What exactly is wrong with wanting to know the views of the person representing me on such an issue?

&gt;If you were a member of 'friends of Uganda', because you wanted to do something about their anti-gay laws that keep being posited, would you mind someone assuming you were actually in favour of those laws just because of your membership?

Well if that were the case, I'd be sure to make it clear what such a group is about. Being secretive about my membership, when I am representing a large group of people, is not a great way to ensure they feel represented accurately and confident in me. 

&gt;Which does not mean you can automatically dictate/ inspect what groups they are private members of. Politicians do not become public property

The public is their employers. I don't feel that enquiries into their *work related groups* is beyond the purview of that employer. It's not asking what clothes they shop for, what restaurants they eat at. It's asking their views on a political issue and whether this secret group informs those views or not. Those who rule should not be exempt from scrutiny.

&gt; because you're supposed to vote for their policies, not their personal choices.

Yet as demonstrated yesterday, MPs do not always make it clear what views they put forth are personal choices, and which are not. There were enough MPs yesterday who said ""My constituents may feel same-sex marriage is acceptable, but I do not"". If their personal choices are affecting their policies, I don't feel it's excessive that the public know this.

&gt;It's this sort of logic that companies assume means they can ask to inspect your FB page, for example.

I see what the other person meant about strawmen.

It can be harder to get civil partnerships recognised in other countries than same-sex marriages, as the provisions for civil partnerships (or whatever they are called) vary so much from one country to another, whereas marriage is pretty much universal.

The fact there will be at least one institution that treats same- and opposite-sex couples the same is important to many people: it will mean that you no longer have to out yourself on forms that ask for your marital status, and will mean that trans people no longer have to get divorced before they can obtain a gender recognition certificate.

Same-sex couples also have the problem that they are seen as inferior to opposite-sex couples by much of society, and the term ""civil partnership"" really does contribute to this.  Straight people do not have to deal with this issue.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Sure?

Which means everything stalls, unless we're discussing a perfect world.

&gt;You mean like Mordechai Vanunu, who was lured to Italy, then drugged and kidnapped? Or Imad Hassan Atwi, a Lebanese sheepherder who was kidnapped because...who knows? It's not just an isolated incident. 

Well, the point was originally made about the peace flotilla. Shall we list the number of people *our* secret services have kidnapped, etc.? Were they also kidnapped for no reason simply because nobody has told you? (I'm making the point about ignorance not being a path to assumptions, rather than kidnapping, etc. is fun).

&gt;You can vote for whoever you like. Such is democracy.

And so Politicans can simply list everything they do, because none of it needs to stay out of FOI radar, right? Again, in a perfect world that would be fine.

&gt;Something called 'Friends of Israel' is clearly concerned with Israeli issues.

'Clearly' - that sort of illustrates my point. Israeli orphans? Israeli expansion? Or Israeli non-expansion? Doesn't matter, you'd have already made the choice for them based on nothing but suspicion, which is what the tabloids do.

&gt;What exactly is wrong with wanting to know the views of the person representing me on such an issue?

Dozens - for a start, they will tell you their views regardless of any membership or not. But more importantly, they may be a member in secret (for example) because they're part of an anti-settlement-expansion drive, which could well upset the Israeli Government when dealing with them. To insist that everything is open and above board *regardless* is less politics, more Jack Ryan.

&gt;Well if that were the case, I'd be sure to make it clear what such a group is about. 

Again, if you're a politician, you don't always have the option to do that.

&gt;I don't feel that enquiries into their work related groups is beyond the purview of that employer.

You use FB at work, yes? So you won't mind your employer looking over your *work-related-website*. Why not? They didn't vote for you, they're *paying* you, and they have a right to know what you're up to since (etc. etc.) - sound fair?

&gt;It's asking their views on a political issue and whether this secret group informs those views or not. Those who rule should not be exempt from scrutiny.

It's for this reason we vote for policies and not people - for example, if we had *known for sure* that the coalition was going to vote in Gay Marriage, would you have refused to vote for your MP if he disagreed, considering the majority swayed it? You can't dictate what an MP's opinions are, and since the end result will be the same (regardless of memberships or not), you still vote for what they're advocating (or not, if you don't agree). they're not going to make policy change based on a single, secret group's say-so without enough justification for the change to carry weight regardless of secret-group or not. For example, if most of the Conservative ministers are members, what policies would you say have been influenced by the secret group? Where is the obvious bias that it has potentially produced that wasn't there before?

&gt;I see what the other person meant about strawmen.

It would be naive to think something uselessly sentimental here, as if people were somehow maturing into this higher level of thinking all by themselves.

Sexual preference? I'm going to assume that you believe there is some kind of neutrality to sexual preference. That it's 'OK' to choose whichever sexuality you like. Am I wrong? But there are things wrong. Even if you were to blame discrimination, the [mental health](http://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead.html) statistics [are not kind](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072932/).

It's ok, Simon. I understand your thinking, and most people's. Because I have 'felt' the same way too. It's romantic to think that the heart can sway whichever way it shall and it's natural to follow it, or perhaps that people are just 'born that way'. While that may not be completely wrong, it's far from right as well. You see, our brains change. Not only do they change as the rest of our body changes, they change when we even think things. I'm talking physical changes that can be noticed during brain scans. Supposing that someone were to find evidence that gay people's brains were different to normal people's brains? That would make sense, even london taxi drivers brain's are different to the majority of the people's brains in UK. Look it all up, cast aside ignorance and free yourself from media mentality. 

I first learnt about Drake during GCSE History. I suppose you could have been asleep or just failed the class. Regardless, it's an interesting story!

true,lkxngn,null,null,"These are not currently legal due to historical reasons of acceptable behaviour in our society: polygamy is not legal because of the traditional definition of marriage being between one man and one woman, and incest is not legal is probably due to genetic defects introduced by inbreeding.

I expect this will remain as such because - aside from thought experiments like your question - there is no drive to change the law. Polygamy and incest are not sexual orientations, there is not a large marginalised minority and supporters demanding a change in the law, and the amount of people who would benefit from such a change is negligible. In addition, incest at least would have negative consequences when it comes to breeding.

In contrast, legally redefining marriage as being gender and sexuality neutral provides benefit to a large number of gay couples who wish to have their relationships regarded as equal to heterosexual relationships. It also fits in well with the current majority social mores in this country, where homosexual people are considered to be equal to heterosexual. It also helps redress past homophobic grievances against the Government and society.

Well as some examples: teacher/pupil, boss/employee, parent/child. These are positions of unequal power.

&gt;Surely living with someone and being older than someone is not a prevention from those people eventually marrying, should they wish to. 

That's not an analogous situation.

&gt;I don't see how that protection could not be afforded, whilst at the same time allowing consenting adults who are related to marry. 

Please explain how that protection would be afforded.

&gt;Abuse could be present in many situations, but we don't then throw up legal blockages to marriage. 

You're conflating marriage and incest here. 

&gt;well it's a complication, not an objection; we could find a legal and workable solution to the issue of children following divorce. 

I think that it's possible to navigate the legalities. But the legal issues are a valid argument against polygamy that doesn't appeal to emotion of offence.

I'd like to point out that personally, I don't have a moral problem with either of those things in principle.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"Incest:
On ethical grounds, your supposition is that they would be unable to have biological children, presuming that not all incestuous couples are same sex, then would you a) enforce the no children rule by having at least one of the pair sterilised prior to the marriage, (not to mention, do you think it would be morally acceptable to confirm this?) or, b) in the event of a pregnancy occuring enforce a termination, regardless of their wishes?

Either one seems cruel on an ethical level - almost like saying, yes, you are two cosenting adults and therefore you can be married, just like anyone else, but we are going to enforce strict rules on you, which we do not enforce on other couples. Morally, this would be unenforceable and it is (imo) wrong to say that only same sex incest should be legal. That would be discriminatory.

I understand the genetic implications of incest and because you would not be able to enforce the no-children rule (realistically) then this would be unworkable imo.

Bigamy: This is a thin (very thin) social argument. Modern British houses are small. A standard double bedroom in a standard British house built after about 1940 barely accomadates a double bed and wardrobe. Imagine that in your poly-marriage, you all wanted to sleep in one bed. Do you only allow rich people to do this? Social housing is stretched already, it wouldn't be feasible to allow people who need social housing to have larger/more expensive homes because of a lifestyle choice.

There is also likely to be a requirement for more bedrooms (I believe standard new builds are 3/4 beds?) in which case - you would probably (and this is mostly conjecture) require personal space so that each consenting adult requires their own bedroom, plus any extra rooms required by the children? And there are likely to be more children. Most religions which allow polygamy appear to do so to increase the number of offspring - certainly in older polygamous cultures, the quantity of the offspring always appeared to be the main point of pride and point of the polygamy. Ethically, you cannot restrict such lifestyle choices to the well off and socially, the infrastructure we have would not cope, certainly in the short term, there would be very cramped and overcrowded living conditions.

Then there is the gene pool - although any offspring would be only half siblings, that still puts more (much more) of the populace in a restricted gene pool moving forwards (multiple generations) because, although this may not have an immediate effect, it is likely that after a few generations the gene pool would shrink noticably. In some areas it already has (think stereotypical sink estate where almost everyone is related).

I did wonder if your 'no biological children' rule would apply here also, but then we are left with the moral/ethical dilemma of how to prevent biological children. 

Legally - in both cases, it is currently illegal in the UK and likely to remain so for whatever reasons the government of the past saw fit to implement these laws in the first instance.

The calculations were wrong regarding the effects of public spending on the private sector. 
So we now have increased borrowing, £64billion more than Osborne forecast in 2010 and a stagnant ecconomy.  Osbornes borrowing is now higher than Balls proposed and the coalition will have to restart the capital expenditure projects, such as school refurbishment.  Effectively Plan B will be Ed Balls Plan A.  But don't make the mistake of thinking I am saying Balls would have done a better job.  I think anyone trying to sort out a country in this global new ecconomy would get a lot wrong.  But Osborne needs to accept that his Plan A has failed.

For instance, I went to pay my income tax at  the end of January.  Since I'm already registered for VAT, I thought it would be easy.  But no, to register online for income tax payments, you have to be sent a new authorisation code - through the post.  So that took a week to arrive.  When it did, I entered the code and bingo, account set up.  So I click the ""how to pay"" button, because there's no ""pay"" button.  About half way down the very long ""how to pay"" page is a link that lets me ""pay by visa debit"".  I click it and a new window opens, Billpay by Santander.  I log into that.  Then, because its Income Tax and not VAT, I have to set up new details.  I have to enter my unique tax code, which the HMRC website hasn't helpfully filled in for me (like any other website would).  So I search for that, find it, and go to pay.  Then it asks for my card details, even though I've gone through about 30 million security passwords.  And *then*, after all that, some stupid ""visa online security"" box comes up, with *another* password.

* A large amount of data in the microchip databases is inaccurate or out of date. Many chipped dogs will still not be reunited.
* Having your name on the chip database does not prove ownership. It would be easy to argue against your responsibilities in the event of an attack, or easy to claim a dog is yours regardless of the chip.
* Vets do not routinely scan a chip and therefore a stolen dog could go unnoticed. Stolen dogs are also virtually untraceable due to data protection act [news article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1314154/Microchip-firm-wont-tell-dog-owner-stolen-pet.html#axzz2K8PmdHM1)
* A stray dog is either wanted, or unwanted. If wanted, someone is presumably calling every rescue centre in the area daily for months! If unwanted, see above regarding ownership and prosecution.
* Finally, it is near impossible to enforce... meaning the irresponsible dog owners who let their dogs loose to chase cars or put them into dangerous situations (i.e. with unsupervised children), are surely equally irresponsible in regards to chipping anyway. It's been law for dogs to wear a tag with owner's name and contact details on them, but that's never enforced and yet it's easy to check.

Once again, innocent, responsible owners will have to pay out funding British(?) microchip manufacturers, irresponsible owners will flout the law. Strays will stay the same, bite and attack levels will stay the same.

Strays are the result of poor training and over breeding. Not from a lack of microchips. Put stricter laws on breeding, with max quotas, mandatory regular vet visits and a max of one litter per year with x litters per lifetime with stricter rules about the emotional needs of dogs, beyond the basic water and shelter laws we have at the moment.

This means when you don't tip your server, we actually have to pay to wait on you!! Not to mention if you only leave 10%, we only make 5% because of the tip share. 

So please remember,  when you are tipping you are not just paying for the service you received during your meal. You are paying for the hostesses who seats you,  the cleanliness of the restaurant, the drinks you ordered to be prepared, the kid who didn't wait on you but brought your food out so it did not sit in the window for even 10 seconds and everything else we, the server, do for you. We offer exceptional service at my business, but we pay in advanced for you to have that exceptional service. If you don't take care of us, we are getting fucked, we rely on your tips for everything!  $2.65 doesn't even cover my taxes. I get a $0 check every week.

Then we welcome Doctor Who fan and cosplayer, Quiana who shares with us her passion for costuming as her favorite characters.

Also, as promised, a review of the first issue in the IDW series, Doctor Who: Prisoners of Time. And a look at the recently aired Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited from BBC America.

And of course, some news and your feedback!

Enjoy!

Many big businesses based in Scotland have pledged to leave if independence is gained, what is left of our shipbuilding industry will fall to the wayside, no business will want to invest in a freshly independent country that is in deep recession and we will retain the pound as our currency so have little to no control over how things will play out. Regarding the oil, the SNP will not nationalise the oil industry so the country itself will see no more money than we see now from oil exports, perhaps even less as the UK owns part of the oil.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Also need to take into account AVB's opinion of Danny and AVB.  AVB did say he didnt' want to sell Danny earlier this season, but if he rates him that path may accelerate also BAE's market value may accelerate Danny's progress, a good offer that comes in may change AVB and Levy's mind on keeping him around for 2 years.

In a perfect world i think you are right, we could send Rose out for another season to get himself up to where we need it but that could all change very quickly.  I think if we are smart we should make this point clear to Danny.  You can push for a move to someone like Sunderland where you know you will start but is a mid-table at best team (in and around the drop at worst) or you can show a little patience and potentially have a chance at starting for a top 4 side where worst case scenario he isn't good enough to start for us and we sell him on to another team that he can start for.  

At 22 i know that everything seems huge and needing to happen at light speed but in his case i think it is in his advantage to wait it out for another season as in the worst case scenario we either keep BAE or bring in a higher grade replacement or we sell him on to a mid-low table team where he starts.

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","1) if it generally leads to one man having many wives (as has traditionally occurred), this leads to a small minority of men having lots of wives, and a great number having none. 

Lots of sexually frustrated men denied the chance to find a partner/mate? That's not a great idea.

2) if it ends up with a lot of cases of one woman married to several men, that's going to kill a birthrate. She can only be having a baby with one of them at any one time.

Tbh, the first situation is more likely though with our current society, and everyone knows it. There'd be footballers with ten trophy wives a lot more than there'd be female CEOs with 4 husbands.  
And before someone says that it doesn't have to be about money/status, that's how its always happened before.

As an aside, I tend to find this argument is a lot more of a hypothetical one than a realistic one. Are there thousands of women out there clamouring to be married to more than one man?
Likewise, is there really enough related family members wishing to marry to make your very specific case worth legislating for?

true,Araneatrox,eng-staffordshire,Living in Sweden,"**Warning pretty long post.**

I have received a few PM's asking the same so I am going to post them here and then permalink to everyone. 

First of all, emigrating is easy. If you are a British passport holder you have everything already sorted. Just leave the country and find somewhere to live. Most people will sort this out first with funds set aside. I went to go live with my partner who is Swedish.

Dealing with the bureaucracy of the country is the hard part. In order to register for the Arbetsförmedlingen(Job Centre) you must first visit the Skatterverket in order to get a Personal number and a valid work permits. However in order to do that you need to get accepted for permanent immigration from the Migrationsverket. I have been accepted for 2 years because I am engaged to my partner and we live together, however if I would not have had a job in that 2 years or I would not have gotten married I would be asked to return to England. 

After jumping through several hoops in order to get my Immigration actually sorted so I could start work. First off my first contact meeting with someone from the Migrationsverket was a disaster. My partner was not there and when they took my details from my Passport/Driving License they wrote me down as ""Araneatrox British Citizen"" Instead of ""Araneatrox Middle Last"" So I had to wait for 3 months before I could even get my shit sorted. 3 months later I get my notification that I have been accepted as a Swedish Immigrant and I am free to register as for a Personal Number from the Skatterverket. Skatterverket took 6 weeks from start to finish however I was told off by them for not going to their office as soon as I landed. However I did in fact goto their office in Hallunda where I was referred on to the Migrationsverket(This becomes a recurring theme of passing you from post to post in order for them to lighten their load for the time being). 

After I received my Personal Number from the Skatterverket I was free to register for the Arbetsförmedlingen in order to obtain work and unemployment aid. You are left alone for much of the first 3 months to do what you need to. However you can always go into one of the branches and request help if you want. Bear in mind that the Swedish CV is much different to the English CV and employers do not like change or anything new. With me being Under 25 I was placed on something called the ungdomsgaranti Basically if you are under 25 you have jobs thrown as you. Not fantastic jobs but still Jobs. When you get a job all problems go away basically. 

Bank accounts are the only problem left. In order to get a bank account you need your Personal Number and to be actively receiving money. In order to receive money you need a Bank account(You can see where i am going with this) The entire system makes it very hard for someone to actually start a life here. I still do not have a bank sorted I am still using my Partners. However after speaking with my Contact person at the Arbet they said get a written and hand signed letter saying what I earn and what I do for work. 

**Now to answer some questions more directly.** 

1. I did not have a job lined up beforehand, I saved up about £1000 from 6 months Unemployment benefit and some Birthday money. 

2. I have a University Degree in 3D Modeling for Games and Animation. 

3. Jobs are pretty easy to come by if you don't mind working as a potwasher/binman etc etc. Swedish folks are pretty snobby when it comes to that. Average minimum wage is about £800-£1000 per month and is paid on the 25th every month. That money is more than enough for a single person to live off without many problems. 

4. Drinking culture is vastly different, £8 or more per pint at a regular pub £12-£15 per drink at a Nightclub. 

5. The government funded Language course is called SFI I dislike the way it is taught it is a sink or swim lesson structure. You are placed into a already existing class and expected to pick up from there. I highly suggest working through the 4 Rosetta Stone Swedish courses that there are available before moving. Yea i am sure you know where to get it without breaking the bank. 

6. Swedish is the best country in the world for 2nd language English. Their fluency rates in English is something stupid like 97% of people under 35. 

Hope that helps some of you out. The country itself is really lovely. Right now it is snowing, it has been snowing for 2 days and there is a nice sheet of 30CM snow outside. This last December there was a day where 80Cm fell in a single 4 hour block. 


EDIT- 

I almost forgot, ask for help at every single point you can. If you have a meeting or have a phonecall with someone ask questions.

It is also being abused *heavily* every day, so it is bound to be stretched to it's limits. Some NHS trusts are still using very old (sometimes paper) systems to keep track of things - this causes problems and is wasting time. Other times, spending is diabolical in other trusts.

And found the following, which I suspect might be a fairer summary of the situation.

&gt; Many Muslim leaders, notably those of Salafi, Wahabi, and Deobandi tendencies (but also a large number of those of Barelwi persuasion), believe that music is forbidden both by the Qur'an and by the hadith, as well as by tradition. Many of the greatest Islamic scholars of the past, including the four Imams, agreed upon this [1]. For extended argument to this effect, see these sites: [2], [3] and [4].

&gt; Other Muslims retort that music is forbidden only if it leads the believer into sins like drinking alcohol and carousing with courtesans. Music can be a harmless accompaniment to family or community celebrations or to public devotions. The caliphs, the leaders of the Islamic empire, entertained noted musicians[citation needed]. Respected philosophers such as Al-Kīndī, Al-Farābi, Avicenna, and Safi al-Din encouraged the practice of music through their study of music theory.

In practice we can see that this is no easy task to provide, it is open to all kinds of abuse and it is clear that some hospitals are providing a service FAR below what is expected of the NHS. People should not be sitting in a bed without being washed for a month, or left with food and drink out of reach. Or refused help to go to the bathroom instead forced to soil their beds, or left on toilets for hours afraid and alone.

You ask if we have been 'conditioned into believing the failures of the NHS' - I would say that we have been conditioned into believing that the NHS is - as so many put it 'the envy of the world'. Which I find difficult to believe when it has never been replicated by another country on the planet and WHO ranks us 18th in healthcare standards.

People need to stop treating the NHS like some kind of sacred cow that is beyond reform, it is CLEAR that some kind of reform is necessary to prevent the kind of lunacy that is prevailing just now. 

Now, finding the reform that is necessary is what is difficult. The unions and the left will say its all the fault of managers and staff cuts etc. The right will say its a lack of 'old fashioned healthcare' and employees who show no compassion or nurses who stick their noses up at cleaning up after patients because they have a degree. Emotions will boil over and people will become blinded by ideology rather than thinking logically about a solution, as always happens with these polarising issues. 

I suspect the problem is a bit of both. I have seen both compassionate workers who have been rushed off their feet working on an understaffed ward and having to fill in all this needless paperwork. And I have seen a nurse let a patient sit in soiled sheets because they weren't to start work for another 10 minutes.

The way we treat the elderly in this country truly truly TRULY makes me sick. Everyone gets old one day, a lot of NHS workers should probably remember it will be them lying in that bed in a few decades. I can't even begin to think how it would affect my dignity, to have lived my life and then to be left lying in a shit covered bed for hours after 50 years of paying into a system that is supposed to look after me.",0,1360183029,null,0,false,0,c8ajahy,t3_180aea,t1_c8ajahy,t3_180aea,null,1431212182,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

This reminds me of the reasons behind non-www nasa.gov not resolving.

Implementing the non-www version would likely crash an old system somewhere that no one even knows exists anymore, and eventually cause a heap of issues.

true,tlisia,null,null,"I know what the excuse is. Think of this as a response not to you, but what I wish I could say to the bloody council. Here's why it's an excuse and not a reason: 

* Parking permits are still required for campus. The people who live in the University area do not qualify to park on campus, so they cannot drive there. Thus people have their cars for a different purpose. What this is has not been considered. Admittedly, some will be petty, but others may have good reason. 

* You say 'student cars clog up the roads', like a working person's doesn't. They generally take up a similar amount of space to my knowledge? Why not charge equally? You know, so you include the people who actually have an income.


* You also say this like students don't work. In the current economic climate, a lot more people are keeping their jobs elsewhere and returning to them each weekend to work. I don't have enough fingers and toes to count off the people I know who do this or have done this. Not seeing the difference between them travelling to work and someone else?

In truth, I have two main issues with the policy. 

* They define students and residents separately. You might as well call them 'students' and 'actual, normal people'. I've lived here for four years, worked here and studied here, paid bloody tax here. How does this make me less of a resident than my next door neighbour?
Council tax payments? Oh, so the council are trying to undermine the government ruling that students don't pay council tax by claiming the money another way? It's incredibly demoralising; makes it seem like a punishment for wanting to be educated.


* Secondly, they do not make *any* allowances. Blue badge holders are charged, for instance. I'm sorry, but I'd say a blue badge holder needs a car more than someone working in another city. When questioned about this with regards disabled visitors, the council says to get someone else to drive them and park elsewhere, undermining independence entirely unnecessarily and inconveniencing someone else.  Not to mention that people have been fined for such drop offs before. They try to fine you whilst you're still in the car, actually. 


Now combine this with the fact that they've been trying to move the students out of the student area and in to as-yet-unbuilt, purpose built accommodation - all 30,000 of us - I'd say this comes across as part of a campaign. If it were against a race of people, it would probably be illegal.

There is actually a really good, really balanced student article [here](http://www.impactnottingham.com/2009/06/are-we-losing-lenton/) on the matter of the councils trying to disperse student populations - seriously, it's worth the read. The writer lays out some exceptionally valid reasons for wanting to disperse the student community.

 The only thing I would note is that she mentions rubbish in the streets and ill-kept houses, neither of which can often be helped by the students themselves. For instance, it took us three months to get a wheelie bin when we moved in - it was gone again after Christmas, despite being kept in our back garden. I can't count the number of times the neighbourhood cats had been through the bin bags. Also, landlords do not keep the houses up to standard, *at all*, and the students have no choice but to live there. The council refuses to assist students or just wastes enough time that they don't have to act during the shorthold tenancy. I can give you a walking tour of homes covered in mould and running water inside from the damp, I can show you houses with holes in the walls, and entire terraces subsiding in to their own cellars - these are not the fault of the students, and are outside of our tenancy agreements. Without anyone governing student landlords in terms of quality, the streets are going to stay looking as they are. 

The article gives some excellent perspective on what sounds like a brilliant idea. Until you realise that Nottingham's bad reputation generally comes from the residents of St. Ann's, Sneinton and the Meadows where they want to develop this. Not only are these completely unreasonable walking distances, forcing students to pay for transport, they are actually very dangerous places. Think of the worst council estate you can - you might be halfway there. They are not the places you walk alone at night, at all (If you live there I'm sorry - but there really is a strong criminal element). Regardless of what security is available on the door of the accommodation, the council will need to work on cleaning up the area before they're going to get students moving in.

And don't get me started on how unreliable the transport can be. In fairness, most of the very widely used student services run regularly enough for the fact that the bus companies don't seem to even know what a timetable is to not be an issue so I doubt it'd be a concern should these developments take place. Bizarrely, they're award winning, before that's brought up. Punctuality can't have been a factor for consideration.

Matt's portrayal isn't a grizzled war vet, he is an old man who has to wear a mask to keep himself from tearing himself apart from memories of his past, and when he's forced to grow up and remember all those things he wishes to forget he becomes furious. 

Now as for a movie, if we were doing the Time War, does it state anywhere that 8 was the only version of the Doctor that fought in it?

true,philipwhiuk,null,null,"The primary problem with student cars 'clogging up the roads' is that Universities are built near residential areas - not all of which become student housing. So then these areas get used as roadside car parks. Contrastingly the residents have driveways and offices have car parking.

Regarding permits, the council can't control these. The University wants to reduce the total number of students. The Council wants to reduce the number from specific geographic locations. They have different objectives and so different systems.

Students might work, but they don't work a working week. Students pay reduced council tax and only live there during term time.

In terms of specific Nottingham issues (I'm speaking broadly about other areas), I would tend to agree with the idea of spreading the University population. Multi-occupational society is a good thing in my books (much like the 'multi-cultural society' goals of governments).

In terms of housing quality, this is market forces quite frankly. If there were sufficient housing that a bad location was simply left unoccupied then this wouldn't be an issue.

My point regarding university permits was that students are not using their cars to get to university. I was pointing out that this makes it abundantly obvious that this cannot be the reason students have their cars, invalidating one of the councils arguments. That the council tries to use it is, again, ill thought-out

Does it make any difference that they don't work 9-5? Neither do some others not in education. It doesn't alter that they have to travel to work. 

Again, I tackled reduced council tax. The government decided because we generally don't have an income and don't qualify for any other benefits of the Welfare state (no, postgrads do not receive student loans). Is that the council undermining a government decision then by trying to 'recoup' their losses in another way? Because that's how it comes across.

Students are forced to live in areas where the landlords will let to students. I was once, several years ago, told that I didn't have a 'secure income' as a student to take on a fixed term lease. Bollocks: undergraduates have a more secure income than those earning a wage. Undergrads get paid no matter what, as long as they're still in university. People just don't want to let to students in nicer areas because they think they'll wreck it - which is true, for some, so I can't blame them. Although it is frustrating for those who are responsible members of the community. So unfortunately, it's not really possible for students to fix the housing situation.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"**TL;DR** With childless incest you still have a cultural inbreeding. With childless poly you could have the justin beibers and katy perrys with hundreds of partners and many *possibly* better long term partners having to look harder for a partner. Poly also has problems where different partners best interests clash and you have to choose whom to support and whose needs to ultimately reject or regulate.  

With biological children involved you get inbreeding with both. 


--------------------------------

Incest leads to a higher likely hood of genetic birth defects which would put a strong emphasis on ""no ability to have biological children"". It also looks like people who have never really left the family in a social/develomental sense. You get  cultural (and genetic) inbreeding in that people don't mix on an intimate level with people from different backgrounds.

Polygamy/Polyandry often leads to One breadwinner with multiple children.  

Polygamy/Polyandry hasn't really been studied or witnessed much in the west other than in Utah so it's hard to objectively comment on it. 
Polygamy does exist in islamic regions. My ( very limited ) understanding is that it is something for the rich mostly. 

I did see one docu about about a polygamous mormon cult. Surprisingly the children seemed to come out of it okay but I think it was to do more with having lots of kids around to help and support them. ( link to docu overview http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00szwgj ). I actually fully support kids growing up surrounded by loads of other kids but I personally think lots of mummies and daddies can be confusing to kid ( from what I've witnessed with divorcee kids ). it probably requires careful management.  There is also the argument that a polygamous society favours men who are best at getting ( or even controlling )  women. 

With marriage you can never truly know how fit your chosen partner is for an entire lifetime.  

Poly creates a marriage cycle based on those who can *convince* potential partners that they are the best marriage prospect ( whether they are or not)  ending up with lots of partners.  Whilst others who may be better long term partners are left partnerless due to their lack of upfront attractiveness. ( ie the brad pitts, justin beibers, katy perrys and emmas stones of the world would have potentially thousands of partners if they chose to). 

Some interpret marriage as being for two people who will support and a go along with other persons best interests. With two person marriage you either support your partner or you don't. With poly you have a problem of choosing whom to support and go along with. One partner wants to move to a new job the other doesn't. what do you do?  

[ Also if you have Poly with biological children you have communities with many half cousins and likleyhood of finding someone NOT distantly related actually reduces over time. ( in horse racing most breeding pairs share great grandparents because of the ""one father many mothers"" situation that has existed for generations in the breeding industry ). ]
