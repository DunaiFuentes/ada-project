I'm sure the rest of rural UK could devolve from London, and then you'd have to pay a lot more for your food. You wouldn't have to ""support"" rural areas any more, and they wouldn't have to ""support"" you by selling agricultural produce so cheaply.

I don't really see what Thatcher's speech has to do with anything, because ""They're casting their problem on society … People have got the entitlements too much in mind"" seems to wholly lack nuance, to me. That's one of the statements, taken with full context, which illustrates to me that Thatcher was more stupid than she's given credit for. In that she blames the poor, and says that the rich ""have a duty to look after ourselves first, before we look after our neighbour"" (not quite a literal quote, but close).

Labour enacted civil partnerships in 2004. That was 9 years ago.

Whilst I would have preferred to see gay marriage in the first place, there would have been even more resistance to it back then. I'm pretty sure that calling them ""civil partnerships"" originally was about making the institution more acceptable to the refuseniks. 

We've had a great deal of progress in the last 10 years. In 2003 the Tories were still challenging the overturn of Section 28 - Cameron himself has said some awful things in quite recent memory. But it is that progress, the widespread acceptance of cilvil partnerships, which has paved the way for gay marriage.

I don't think we should make this a partisan issue - it's about acceptance and younger generations and stuff. But if you want to make it a partisan issue, I'll wager we could take a look at [the gay rights map of Europe map that was so proudly posted here 5 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1ei9su/another_lgbt_rainbow_map_were_still_top_xpost/) and award points to each party.

Near Edinburgh, I strongly recommend Tantallon and Dirleton, have a[look here](http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/attractions/castles) for an idea of how they look. 

There are a number in Cumbria worth visiting, a particular favourite of mine is [Brougham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brougham_Castle). Yes, you can climb up inside the walls, Yes, that is awesome. If you are there, 2 miles away is Penrith, which has a castle in the centre, but in far worse condition. Not worth a separate trip, but a quick stop on the way past, absolutely. Carlisle castle, also, is well worth a visit - complete with scary dungeon for the kids, and last time I was there, a regimental museum with an armoured car and an artillery piece if they are into that.

There is lots of good information here, I wont repeat that, but one further thing -  don't restrict yourself just to castles. [Helmsley Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmsley_Castle) in Yorkshire is worth a view, but is also very near [Rievaulx Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rievaulx_Abbey), and that is breathtaking. Personally I believe [Fountains Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountains_Abbey) is even more impressive, but the youngsters may disagree. 

The city of York also has a castle,[Cliffords Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford%27s_Tower) in the centre, and contains many publicly accessible ruins, its own city walls, many medieval buildngs still standing, a viking museum/ride called Jorvik, and [York Minster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Minster).

I'm just a lowly Engineer but even I can point out that every single part of his argument is completely and utterly flawed!

* The law doesn't make incest legal, so a man will never be able to marry his son, just as right now, a man can't marry his daughter to avoid inheritance tax

* The law doesn't change rules about succession, and artificial insemination is used by both gay couples and straight couples (if they can't conceive normally) so if the current Queen can't make an artificially inseminated heir, then neither can a hypothetical future gay Queen.

* If the future Queen/King is gay, what difference does it make?

I normally argue for the existence of the HoL because I think it's good to have intelligent and prominent people to look at the laws and argue for/against them without having to worry about popularity and elections.

Then one of these fuckers comes along, and I realise that my logic is flawed because the HoL is actually made up of crusty old idiots who are as qualified to give opinions on law as the spider eating a fly hovering around the dog shit stuck on the bottom of a builder's discarded shoe.

When your main investment thesis for a hedge fund no longer works, you either find a new one (and get clients to buy into it), or you shut down. He chose to shut down.

The spin on it was that he said he hadn't been spending any time there anyway (he hadn't actively managed the fund since 1990), and was more focused on his sports investments. 

The NESV fund is huge, but I still doubt they are going to invest any more money. They didn't last season, or the window before that - the money was LFC money. They paid £47M of the bank loan down which reduced interest to 0, but the transfer funds came out of operating funds.

We have the £60M in new television money, but next season we are only allowed to increase our wage bill 8%, so a lot of that money will go into transfer fees.

But the government has no right to say British men marrying foreign women are predators until proven innocent. Also, this applies to both men and women, hetero- and homosexual couples.

&gt; This only is a concern for people bringing in Chinese/Thai/Russian bought and paid for brides.

That's handled by a completely different requirement. There are requirements that have to be met that demonstrate you are a real couple, have been together for a while, manage your finances together and so on. They also investigate whether one partner is ""bought and paid for"", and this is also grounds for the application to be declined.

I approve of all of the above. I think it's perfectly acceptable for the government to ensure that people aren't just trying to take advantage of the system.

But people have the right to choose who they marry and start a family with. The government should not be able to write into law something which says that, sure you have this right, but if you don't happen to be sufficiently rich we just won't allow you to exercise the right in the UK, your home country.

That is what I find so detestable.

Of course, British citizens can move to elsewhere in the EEA under the same rules as say a French woman can bring her Turkish husband to the UK.

I'm afraid I don't take all of your previous comments into account when considering my perspective on a discussion, to assume someone does is - perhaps a little presumptuous?

I took the term 'brought low' to have a flavour somewhat similar to being 'humbled' or 'humiliated'.  I do not consider 'humbled' and 'humiliated' to be the same thing - one can be humble without being humiliated.  They are different words due to being different concepts - in the same way 'brought low' and 'humiliated' are different terms, for different concepts (granted similar), but they are not co-referring expressions.

What you did here was linguistically quite clever, but that does not mean it was correct.  You, in your belief that 'brought low' and 'humiliated' are co-referring expressions, attempted to make dopebob agree to being 'brought low', which in your mind was identical to getting to him to agree with being 'humiliated'.  

At this point it should be mentioned that if your going to crutch on precise dictionary definitions to make a point, you should read them correctly;
&gt;The **original** meaning was 'bring low'; the **current** sense dates from the mid 18th century.  

Meaning the current sense of humiliate was to 'bring low', but it is not the case any longer.

So, taking into account your previous beliefs regarding some definitions, in answer to;
&gt;There's no shame in it, but one might say you were ""brought low"" by the experience.

A good answer would be;

Correct, there is no shame in it what-so-ever.  If your concept of 'brought low' is of the mid 16th century persuasion, then no, one may *not* say he was brought low by the experience.  Neither would he say he was humiliated, with the dictionary definition requiring that he be made to ""**feel ashamed and foolish** by injuring dignity and pride"".  He did not feel ashamed to be bested in combat by an overwhelming force, nor did he feel foolish for it.


*Please try to be less anal and divisive.  dopebob has been beaten up, I have been beaten up, and apparently you have too - we all have a perspective on how it feels.  Maybe you felt humiliated when you were getting bullied at school, but that does not mean that everyone feels humiliated when they lose a fight or get mugged.

I think I'm okay with giving Rose a chance at LB, but coentrao is an upgrade for sure. Frankly I'm surprised we've even been linked with him. He cost Madrid over £20 million, hard to see them taking a loss on him, and levy unlikely to sanction such an expensive deal for a left back- although he can play left wing too. Versatility will be important in this summers window I think. A marquee signing.

CM: hard one to call. Who would I like? Modric. In a heartbeat.

Depends who we sell, I think. I think Parker is done with us, personally. He did a great job for us last season, but he's not up to scratch anymore, and is never going to get in ahead of a fit Sandro. I was surprised when we didn't go in for mousa sissoko in January. And infuriated when redknapp ignored the opportunity to sign pjanic before he moved to Roma. Modric would be dreamy, but my head tells me it won't happen. Eriksen could easily be the real deal, and if Liverpool are linked with him, we can definitely beat them to it. 

Striker: Benteke, Remy, Bony, Damiao

Wish I could say I thought it was going to be benteke. It won't be. I think we're going to be priced out. Possibly by Dortmund! Hard to contest that. I'd say Remy would be more our speed, except he might be in prison for his alleged involvement in a gang rape by next season. Damiao, don't break my heart. How many times have we heard that name!

Bony is a risk, but there aren't many options left.

Inflexible rules like this put good loving couples in a stressful and uncertain immigration quagmire.

I didn't say we couldn't. But that's also not the point I was trying to make. Also, if that was the point I was trying to make, where would you suggest we *should* live? Her home country? So British people should be able to live with their foreign spouses outside of Britain, but the reverse only in certain circumstances? I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, I'm saying that because I don't think anyone would really think that. It's just that for a lot of people they'll never have to really sit down and think about this issue. Would you say we shouldn't get married? Would you therefore apply that rule to all British couples as well? No marriage unless you've had at least 16 grand in the bank for at least 6 months.

&gt; The reason for the rules is so that people don't come here purely to leech, if you think about all the stuff she'll have access to the moment she's let in, you'll understand why it's important that she needs to prove that she can support herself at a basic level.

I understand the reasoning, I just think marriage is one area where that shouldn't be applied - **as long as the marriage is genuine**, and as I've discussed above, there are plenty of other requirements that fulfill that purpose. And once again, the other requirements sufficiently cover cases where the foreign partner could be getting married just to ""leech"", as you put it. So essentially this requirement is being placed on couples who have already proved that that is not the case for them.

&gt; If it was as you wanted - we'd simply let everyone in to immediately take advantage of all of the benefits and public services.

But that's not what I said at any point. All I'm saying is I'd remove the financial requirement for foreign spouses/partners.

I'm not sure which history text he is reading from, AFAIK I am currently working with a more diverse ethically (as well as talent wise) team than I think anyone in England would have had the pleasure to before.

I don't even understand his problem definition.  He talks about things I've never seen evidence for ie: *""Multinational capital needs a precariat: people habituated to unstable labour and unstable living; overqualified for what they are expected to do""*.


* What's multinational got to do about that?
* 'Overqualified' no, no business wants that, people have to pay to be qualified, either directly or indirectly (taxation) they really are against that.  

The glut over 'overqualified' (I put that in quotes, because its not something I've seen in science / engineering, the only fields I've ever run things in) is entirely due to attempts at social mobility.  My mother had a degree, my father doesn't.  Gender roles aside, my Dad earned considerably more than my mother, because he had a skilled vocation.  We have done away with the idea of vocational skills been aspirational.  That is the problem, that is not the fault of employers and companies, but normally those wishing to achieve social mobility without considering the zero sum game element of how boundaries exist.  Now if I was hiring for a role, would I take someone without a degree?  Probably not.  50% of the applicants have them.  Why would I want to look at the bottom 50%?  10 years ago, this wouldn't have been the case, an old boss/mentor had but 6 GCSEs to his name.

The issue here is that people have different ideas of what welfare should be.  Myself it would be useless, I wouldn't be able to pay my mortgage, as a young male with no dependants, I would get more help from my mortgage provider / bank, than my government.  But here is a shocker, I have savings.  My parents, partly due to their own change in financial taught me to keep some of my money aside.  If I want any kind of luxuries, I don't expect the government to provide it.  I do include  luxuries as TV.

Instead I think it should actually help people get work.  The problem here is people trivialise this, they don't acknowledge that to an employer hiring someone, their wage is often the lowest cost.  You have to advertise and interview candidates, normally this is with someone who's time is quite valuable too, you have all the insurance and basic overheads of the area they occupy too.  Sure if someone is earning £50k a year these costs pale.  But if its a part time thing, for a few hours a week, on minimum wage, these transaction costs really are problematic.   I am a fan of de-centralised management, giving employees freedom to choose rather than trapping them in rules, more so than the average management type, but I acknowledge that even just say having 10 people do street sweeping would be costly, the risk assessments will demand basic training and equipment.  If the people, being charitable here, are bottom of the barrel these costs are higher.

So I sigh inside when I see an article like this, lambasting companies which are willing to look at trying these back to work schemes, even though the real costs will be unclear.  It is saddening because they have never had to deal with the worst end, of the kind of people who have a habit of being perpetually unemployed.

&gt; It's right that people should show that they can support themselves.

But you don't have to. If you have children they won't have to. If you married a British person you still wouldn't have to. I understand where you and everyone else posting here is coming from, I really do, but I just think in this case it's wrong. People should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose and everything that goes with that. It's my opinion, but I really hope I'm not alone in it.

&gt; I wouldn't expect to be allowed to stay in another country without having to show savings or a job either.

If you marry someone of another nationality, chances are you won't have to meet any financial requirement to be granted leave to reside there with that person while your relationship persists. You may have to have police background checks done, show your relationship is real and various other things, but but rarely in any country are you required to show you have a certain degree of wealth before they'll give you the full acknowledgement of marriage. The UK used to be the same as well. This is a more recently introduced requirement.

&gt; And as someone else pointed out, combined earnings of 18k/yr is basically the poverty line, so if you can't manage that, you're going to seriously struggle to live in the UK anyway.

I know, and that's not what I'm complaining about. Even despite the fact that, as I mentioned elsewhere it is a little bit more complicated than that, the figure is not the point. The point I want to make is that how much money we have shouldn't be a factor in how our marriage is legally perceived - the same as it isn't for any other couple in Britain.

Sure, by all means check she's not a criminal, check she doesn't owe money to the NHS or any other British institution, check she is who she says she is, check that we're both entering into the marriage willingly, check she doesn't any other ulterior motive for wanting to get into the UK.

* The train station in Cambridge is quite a way out from the centre of town. It is about a 20 minute walk, although there are some buses.

* There is no one 'university site' to look at. The university is made up of colleges, each with their own buildings and grounds, scattered throughout Cambridge. There are some 31 colleges, so you will probably not get to see them all in one day.

* For a tourist visitor, the colleges charge an entry fee ~£5 each. If you are feeling brave you can walk straight in to *some* colleges (probably not Johns or Kings), so long as you walk with confidence.

* The university is currently in 'quiet period' due to students' exams. I know Queens' College is now closed to casual visitors until June 22nd, and I expect most other colleges will have similar rules.

If you get some of the nice people here to agree, we could probably get you in to a few colleges for free... would need to arrange times and dates, though!

I started working there a few years after Merlin had bought the Tussauds group (of which the castle was a part), and it was actually still pretty good on the not being a theme park thing, but over the years it had definitely gone downhill in that respect.

That said, it's still a bloody good castle and a lot of the staff do actually have a passion for the history (the two that really spring to mind are Knowle, who does the bowman show, and Mark, one of the fighting knights)

It's not the cheapest day out, but if you book in advance or get some 241 vouchers (and it's almost hard not to do that, they're everywhere) its not too bad for a full family day out. If you've got youngish lads OP; they will probably love it, especially if you go in the summer as there's a lot on and most of its free (jousting, trebuchet, birds of prey etc). 

There's also Kenilworth Castle which is about 10 miles or so from Warwick, but as it was destroyed by Cromwell during the civil war it's fairly ruined. They also do a summer programme of stuff too, though I can't vouch for what goes on there.

P.S if you do go to Warwick OP FOR the sake of your wallet and my conscience don't do the Merlin Tower. It is seriously crap. Dungeons are good though they might be a bit too much for the boys

1) Whenever I joined in and you guys already had a full XI, I either waited on the bench till a spot opened up, or played whichever position became available. I don't think I ever kicked anyone out of a ""friendly"" type match to play ""my"" position, so I don't really remember what you recall.

2) (Addressing your next comment) You were most likely the best RM we had, but you also rarely had a mic. Landog had a mic and was annoying as all hell with it, so pushing you to defense and keeping him at RM was a matter of self-preservation. When you got pushed back, I didn't have to hear anything about it. When Landog got pushed back, I had to listen to him bitch and moan for 90 minutes.

3) Leadership needs a strong personality. I ran the club league, which was doing quite well, up until people started complaining about how I was doing it. So I stopped doing it to prove a point, and lo and behold, the league fell apart *fucking quickly*. I'm pretty sure it was dead in under a week. That's not a coincidence.

I was using an event in which people may have been attacked for being gay to rise a point about how categorising a group of people as disgust can and does lead to that kind of violence. 

&gt;as for your story about the ""gay basher"" that sounds fairly unlikely as people of school age firstly dont tend to get served in pubs clubs and bars, and secondly arent usually fit to ""bash"" anyone really,

Sorry for the confusion, went to a 6th form college attached to my secondary school so I tend to unthinkingly refer to it as ""school"" even when I'm talking about, as in this case, a time  in my second year of a-levels. He was at least 6ft and part of the rugby team. But nah, didn't happen because you can nitpick based on the fact I said school.

&gt; but whatever. i agree there is a pattern of behaviour in which people want to hurt people who are different to them, partly i'd say because of how we evolved (social justice warriors now's your cue for MUH BIOTRUTHZ memes) but also because of many societal things some of which you and others have covered (to death) and others which i think if i was to go into you'd all dismiss without considering anyway because it sounds incompatible with your particular tribes view in all this (though if you or anyone else cares you can ask)

So instead of actually backing up your arguments you are not going to bother making them because you feel I either wouldn't listen or not understand. In that case I'll just have to presume you don't have any.

&gt;lastly, to be fair if normal is taken at its definition, as in, ""standard"" ""usual"" etc, then, i dont have any stats but i feel pretty confident in saying that there are far less people who identify as gay than those who'd say they were straight, so technically, gay people arent normal that way, not that it matters in my opinion, but im kind of tired of people screwing the definitions around.

Ah nitpicking again. In that definition brown eyes are normal and blue eyes are abnormal but while you could technically call people with blue eyes abnormal we don't because blue eyes are a natural part of being human. In other words blue eyes or being gay may not be the norm for a given individual but they are normal within a group of them. This is why context is important and in this context we have some one calling gays disgusting, the rest seems simple after that.

Stefan King, the chairman, is a very successful Scottish businessman with a huge portfolio of hospitality businesses in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen including bars, clubs, hotels, restaurants and a cinema.  

Notably, the G1 group ""bought"" an entire street of clubs and bars in Glasgow (Ashton Lane) and turned it into one of the most popular places to go on a night out.  In general, they are a rather homogeneous selection of nightclubs, bars and restaurants with a very corporate and sterile feel, which don't appeal to me at all.  The ""Shimmy Club"" venue aims at the ""aspirational"" end of the nightlife market, think r'n'b and chart music with reassuringly expensive drinks.  See and be seen.  

Most of the G1 venues operate a ""selective"" door policy that screens everyone trying to get in.  Typical punters might be the sort who would apply to be on a TV show such as *Geordie Shore*, i.e. guys who have a deep v-necked t-shirt with a tattoo of Old English script on their (waxed) chest, and a thick layer of fake tan.  The sort of people who would buy an entire bottle of vodka to drink at a table to impress women in a club.

Because if someone is saying that we are treating minorities unfairly, I would suggest the burden of proof lies with them, not me.

I can also suggest an inductive model, racism and prejudice to minorities is more likely to be apparent in a large environment, that makes the minorities more minor, in a set of small cells this is less likely to be the case?

Therefore the model he is deriding would provide better support for someone who was of an minority?  Arguably to a point someone who has a disability.

https://www.facebook.com/WhovianAdventures

Your idea is definitely intriguing to me, and I am interested in what you're trying to do.  A few questions...

What kind of plan did you have set up?  Ex: Whatever character each writer creates, do you make each small story part of a bigger story? Does each character intertwine with the other characters from other episodes?  Or does each character tell their tale of how the Doctor recruited them, and each episode only tells their story and what they try to accomplish for the Doctor?

Is this to be written like a giant book?

&gt;Yes, but not in the name of the Doctor.

It's believed right now that John Hurt's character is the reincarnation that ended the Last Great Time War, which occurred between Paul McGann (the 8th Doctor) and Christopher Eccleston (the 9th Doctor).

The Doctor's main mission is to help races, and to help them survive. When the Doctor ended the Last Great Time War, he made his own race go practically extinct, outside of himself and the Master.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"Fair points. I just don't personally associate powerlessness with humiliation, even though they can often be linked. And I don't think it detracts from manliness if you're outnumbered. I think that's a bit of a dated notion as well tbh.

This is going to sound a bit twisted, but I think there's almost a certain amount of pride to being outnumbered and set upon, and managing to make it out the other side. I suppose it's a bit of self-fulfilling prophecy though.

&gt;you become self-conscious for some days (if not much longer), that this happened to you and there was nothing you could do about it. 

If it does affect you psychologically, I can imagine it would then become quite humiliating. But to me it was only ever physical pain. Emotionally I felt pride in having come through the ordeal. My pride, dignity, and self-respect were not injured. Quite the opposite in fact. But I know everyone's different. I'm not saying how anyone else should react to these traumatic experiences. My point is that automatically assigning the feeling of humiliation to the victim can be quite counter-productive and psychologically negative for them. e.g.

&gt;""Oh, it must have been so humiliating for you!""
&gt;&gt;""Well, no actually. It wasn't. I was just outnumbered. But now you've said that I feel a lot worse about it""

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, I understand the wider implications of simply working less in a world where everything else stays exactly the same.  My point is more complex than that.  

We live in a society which has a certain static mechanism, the values within this mechanism are not static.  That is to say; without radical change or revolution, we will always be working for a wage, which we use to buy what we need, food, shelter, warmth, entertainment, etc.  Rather than directly getting these things ourselves, we do a thing (a job) and for the thing, we get vouchers (money), and the vouchers are turned in for stuff (the things I listed).  It's a clever mechanism, because it means we don't all have to do everything, and it's the reason we have got much better at lots of things (building, medicine, electronics), because we can spend our life's concentration on one thing, safe in the knowledge that other people have you covered for all the other stuff that you need, like - making clothes, preparing food, building your house, fixing your broadband.

Say you get £10,000 a year for working 7 days a week, and a loaf of bread is £4.  (Just bare with me).  For every 1 man working 7 days a week at a job and earning $£10,000 - there is another man that is homeless.  He can't get a job, because nobody needs him - so he gets no vouchers - so he gets no stuff.  Everyone says, ""Hell no I can't share my job with this guy, because then I won't be able to afford my rent, pay my bills, buy my food, etc etc - in fact, if I could, I'd work more, because I'm barely scratching by as I am"". 

Now, you don't want to work 7 days a week, because you have other stuff you want to do - go for walks, paint pictures, experiment with circuitry (whatever).  Why not work 3.5 days each, both earn £5,000, and make a loaf of bread £2?  That way your both working, and are a meaningful member of your society.  You both have free time, because we're all human, and we don't want to work all the time.  And you both have bread.  You are earning less, but the number of zeros on the end of what you earn is irrelevant - what matters is the percentage of your wage to the total ""amount of money that exists"".

In a country where the total amount of money is £1,000,000, the guy who owns £10,000 is very rich.  in the country where the total amount of money is £1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, the man with £10,000 is very poor.  Quantitatively less money doesn't matter, what matters is - are you living well?  Money is not a point system of who's winning, and who's losing, it is a tool to run the mechanism.  The mechanism is capitalism.  The mechanism is working if the people are living well.

So back to my point.  Why do people want to work 8 days a week if they could?  The objective is not to work all the time, the objective is to live well, to be comfortable, fed, watered, educated - whatever you want.  The purpose is not to be busting your ass as much as you can manage so you can shop at M&amp;S instead of Tesco, or get that dining set your fiance wants.  

I understand it's 'not as simple as that' - but if we had the option (and we do), why reinforce rules which will cause more and more of a gap, which will in turn cause more and more of a problem.  Why not start filtering in the possibility for people to live well, work well, and be well - then we can see what people will do when they have a bit of free time along with their food and shelter and warmth.  

It's not a popular view I know - but like I said, I struggle to understand why.

If you fail these tests, you will be put into the longer route (10 years if I am not mistaken). 10 years with the uncertainty of not knowing if you will be unable to stay in the same country as your spouse (and possibly children) On top of this, you will have to apply for further leaves to remain every few years. 

Arguing that this is reasonable and equitable totally ignores the fact that if it is fair to ask this of British citizens, how is violation of the human rights of EEA member state citizens to ask the same? 

The government has failed to show that there was a rash of spouses of British citizens breaking their visas and claiming benefits before they implemented these requirements.

as for your story sorry but it seems to me you're testimony's changing on a few things here so i've kind of got you mentally marked down to be a bit dishonest like that, coupled with the fact the story itself is all a bit convenient. but anyway for the sake of it i'll give you the benefit of the doubt because its plausible anyway, though i already agreed with the point you were trying to make with it, or most of it.

as for the so called non existent arguments of mine, i've just come to think that everyones views are a lot more emotional and tribal than anyone would like to admit, mine included no doubt, though ofc to each individual their own views will seem as completely rational as mine seem to me. nevertheless that thought makes all such arguments seem kind of pointless as i guess you will probably dismiss whatever i say anyway because it sounds vaguely against your current favourite camp, though dont think im saying its only you, cos imho its very common.

anyway onto the point, alongside some of the stuff you mentioned like how dehumanising a minority can make people more likely to view them as abnormal outsiders, which is true, there's also in my opinion a lot of fetishisation of being poor in this country, in a similar way that suburban americans used to adopt hip hop culture so as to have some identity for themselves, so do a lot of people here with being ""working class"" whatever that even means nowadays, a lot of people think that means they have to act totally boorish and more stupid than they actually are to everyone in an attempt to come across as tough and unpretentious, like this guy said, [:o he said faggot](http://25.media.tumblr.com/6148ad83f386027197a552327fca525a/tumblr_mn67tnY32d1r5jez2o2_1280.jpg). i think that kind of thing is a much bigger reason, people trying to look tough.

as for the language shit, i agree again, just there is nothing innacurate about calling homosexuality abnormal, it just is, some people might take that as a bad thing to say but really thats kinda jumping the gun again if you ask me. anyway i thought rejection of the value of ""normal"" was a big part of the entire gay rights and related movements",0,1369229330,null,0,false,0,ca3pl12,t3_1es1cr,t1_ca3pl12,t1_ca3os9j,null,1431072749,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Everyone works, but only in the job role that you are allocated, you are not allowed to do anything else (say you unload a wagon and one day the wagon driver calls in sick, even though you know how to drive it you can't since you deprive a person of a job)

The people working have their wages 'Assessed' and taken from them to give to people who have nothing, to ensure everyone has food etc.

Basically it sounds great in prinicple, in practise it results in total lethargy of a workforce.

Say I drop my job to 35 hours, the company then has to give the job to someone else, that person does not really care about doing the work to the best of their ability (for whatever reason) I then spend my 35 hours cleaning the reports that he should have been doing in his 35 hours.

Oh tosh. There's nothing wrong with finding sexual practises disgusting, and frankly, by the meaning of the word homosexuality isn't ""normal"" - there's nothing wrong with it, it's not immoral, but it is abnormal in the same way that earning £100,000 per year or having an IQ of 130 are abnormal. Sure, yes, some of these people will have a dislike to homosexuality, but so what? Tolerance and acceptance are different things. I'm not into scatology, there I said it, that's not dehumanising a minority.

&gt;Or in other words thinking something is disgusting isn't inherently hateful but in this context it is.

Except, you have no evidence of that, all they've said is that they find gay sex to be disgusting, which is a completely acceptable statement to make, and they make no expression of hatred.

In your shoes I would continue to rent whilst planning my escape from the capital. However if you are dead set on London then the questions I would be asking myself are:

- Do I want to live here for another 25 years
- Am I going to marry my GF, can I trust her during any financial dispute (she will be paying half your mortgage remember - double check cohabiting laws).
- How would I feel if I my property lost equity, potentially losing the total amount you plan to put down. I'm not trying to scaremonger but nobody can claim London prices are at a sensible level.

Perhaps a not-so terrible idea would be to take a career break, spend £30k travelling the world for a year or two. It's not such a bad deal when you realise you saved yourself £14k in rent alone for every year outside London.

* It's already been said and I hate to generalise too much but many Americans I've met tend to have their volume settings too high. Just be aware of how loud you're being in public.

* People are generally very friendly and not as stand-offish as say London but even so, striking up a conversation on the street with a complete stranger isn't really done like it is in the States.

* I'm sure you won't do this but don't brag about America, nowhere else thinks you're the greatest country ever.

* British/Welsh humour. If someone makes fun of you, it's not necessarily because they hate you. In fact that's often a sign you're getting on well. We love to take the piss out of each other, don't take it to heart. You also might want to calibrate your sarcasm detector, again trying not to generalise but I've met Americans who just could not pick up on it. Also 'Alright?' is just a greeting, we are not asking what is wrong with you.

* Tipping. I personally hardly ever tip. This is an acceptable stance whereas in America I wouldn't really be able to return to that restaurant/bar/whatever ever again. Occasionally I'll leave a quid or two if the service was exceptional or if a taxi driver had some quality music. Tipping in a bar/pub is pretty much unheard of (at least in my experience).

* Get some understanding of pronunciation. Calling Caio 'C.A.10' just makes you sound an idiot.

I hope I haven't made things seem too intimidating, as I said people in general are very friendly and a lot of areas are very used to having tourists around.

If you bothered to read what I said I said ""this is what results from branding people disgusting"" and I stand by that statement. You can quibble over the motives for that attack but such attacks do result from such actions. If UKIP acts to endorse such small minded views then I will say that UKIP actions are contributing to a culture that makes attacking gay people more acceptable.

&gt;as for your story sorry but it seems to me you're testimony's changing on a few things here so i've kind of got you mentally marked down to be a bit dishonest like that, coupled with the fact the story itself is all a bit convenient. but anyway for the sake of it i'll give you the benefit of the doubt because its plausible anyway, though i already agreed with the point you were trying to make with it, or most of it.

Ah so because I have an experience that helped shaped the views we are discussing it's all too convenient for me to have a relevant experience! That does not *at all* in *anyway* whatsoever make you come across like someone who won't even consider things that don't fit with their narrative because that would be incredibly ironic and fundamentally undermine your ability to make your case.

&gt;as for the so called non existent arguments of mine, 

On the internet ""You are wrong because of things I won't explain"" should be treated as ""I'm talking out of my ass"" because either they are talking out of their ass or they may as well be in terms of what saying so is adding to the debate. It's totally useless and should be called out as such and you'll notice, since you've now deemed us worthy of receiving your explanation, that the device worked exactly as I intended.

&gt;i've just come to think that everyones views are a lot more emotional and tribal than anyone would like to admit, mine included no doubt, though ofc to each individual their own views will seem as completely rational as mine seem to me. nevertheless that thought makes all such arguments seem kind of pointless as i guess you will probably dismiss whatever i say anyway because it sounds vaguely against your current favourite camp, though dont think im saying its only you, cos imho its very common.

Being aware of your bias and seeking to overcome them and being open to the views of others is the only rational way of dealing with this. It's the *only* reason I'm still talking to you. Given what you've said so far I find it unlikely you're going to convince me of anything but I hope I am trying to be open to another point of view.

Personally I think taking this idea of bias and emotionally influenced and making it 'tribal' is reductive in this sense. We are both influenced by those we are around but we also seek out those who have things in common. That people band together around a common idea does not inherently make it bad so long as people are aware that within that group you risk discussions become echo chambers which can both warp ideas and reinforce bad one. 


&gt;anyway onto the point, alongside some of the stuff you mentioned like how dehumanising a minority can make people more likely to view them as abnormal outsiders, which is true, there's also in my opinion a lot of fetishisation of being poor in this country, in a similar way that suburban americans used to adopt hip hop culture so as to have some identity for themselves, so do a lot of people here with being ""working class"" whatever that even means nowadays, a lot of people think that means they have to act totally boorish and more stupid than they actually are to everyone in an attempt to come across as tough and unpretentious, like this guy said, :o he said faggot[1]  . i think that kind of thing is a much bigger reason, people trying to look tough.

I actually agree with aspects of that (ooo look what happens when you are actually willing to engage with some one!) but I think you are drawing the wrong conclusion. The other is all to often the way that groups define themselves, point out what you are not is often as important as point out what you are. This is not always a bad thing in and of itself but it's when The Other is dehumanised in an attempt of self evaluation that bad things happen. History is littered with these examples.

If people are acting boring and stupid and homophobic their reasons for doing so are important for engaging with and changing that behavior but they do not change the outcome. 

Personally what you see as fetishisation of working class I've tended to see as a patriarchal reaction to the rehumanisation and increasing equality of 'the others' that system has so widely defined it's self against. Part of how women and gays are oppressed is be defining given things as ""feminine"" and given things as ""masculine"" and by and large defining those things as ""weak"" and ""strong"". This is underlined by how ""strong"" women in fiction are often labeled as ""strong"" because they act in a way that is defined as ""manly"". Which is not to say women can't or shouldn't act that way as the whole point is that these constructs are largely made up in such a way that ""maleness"" is seen as good. 

The point being that male ideas of self have largely been defined by a society in which male expressions of what is viewed as ""feminine"" traits as bad. Feminist refer to it as a toxic masculinity as a result. The thing is that now we are moving towards equality and the idea that these things that are meant to be ""feminine"" are seen not as weak or bad simply different it calls into question *why* it's bad for a male to express those things. It's not ""manly""? but 'manly' is largely a construct that is defined by dehumanizing the female 'other'.

All in all it's a confusing time for men who are trying to work out how to define themselves or even if there is a *need* to define themselves. Some guys, like my self and a lot of people I know, try and embrace defining ourselves as ourselves rather than worrying about if that makes us ""manly"" but I think we are seeing a huge counter reaction as well that seeks to be *more* ""manly"" and traditionally that results in behavior that you view as being tradioanlly working class. 

I don't think this is the be all and end all of what is going on but we are going through huge social upheaval in terms of how society deals with gender and sexuality and I think a lot of men have failed to realises that unthinking self fulfilling systems of oppression that we are trying to pull down will do much to free them from harmful restrictions on who it's 'ok' to be.       

&gt;as for the language shit, i agree again, just there is nothing innacurate about calling homosexuality abnormal, it just is, some people might take that as a bad thing to say but really thats kinda jumping the gun again if you ask me. anyway i thought rejection of the value of ""normal"" was a big part of the entire gay rights and related movements

true,stax_n_stax,null,null,"Good stuff matey, all props to you. I'm another convert from this season - at least you have the excuse of having been separated from W12 by an ocean up until this year.

I grew up in a far flung part of West London without a truly local team. While it may be traditional to inherit your team from your elders, this never really happened with me. My grandfather was a Mackem but died when I was 5 months old. My mother told me the stories of him dressing the TV in a Sunderland scarf in '73 for their cup win, but he wasn't around to pass along any passion for the team, who in any case would be a nightmare to support from down here. My mother herself grew up further inside West London than me and used to go to Chelsea games in the '70s, but as a single working mother she didn't have any time to ~~corrupt~~ bestow me with much sentiment for them, although I was impressed when they fielded an entire squad of foreign players in the late '90s. I vaguely recall a handful of QPR supporters in primary school, but they were vastly outnumbered by the usual suspects. A mate took me to a Watford game (David James almost knocked me over in his car afterwards) but I don't come away feeling like a connection has been made. In secondary school it was pure Liverpool (immigrants from the 70s who'd fallen in love with them and passed it to their kids), Man U (bedazzled youngsters), Arsenal and Spurs (local-ish teams). I maintained a respectful interest in the primary goings-on from afar, picked Leyton Orient in CM/FM, and and plodded on as an agnostic.

Fast forward a fair few years. My Actonite other half would occasionally tell me about QPR people with whom she'd come into contact through work. She would complain about Steve Gallen being a moody bastard (although I don't trust her judgement on this). My daily routine took me on the Central Line through White City/Shepherd's Bush most days. Every once in a while I would get caught in a train full of fans going home from White City. Come the 2010/11 season, my girlfriend complains that riding herbike home down the Uxbridge Road on promotion confirmation day is a nightmare as there are drunken fans everywhere going crazy. Around this time I'd started looking for a flat locally and it clicks - I'm actually going to live close to a team. It stings a bit that it's a fresh top flight team, as no-one wants to be labelled a bandwaggoner, but after years of being the only footballing orphan among my peers the lure was too great. I started following the team from afar from then on. I ended up living in Acton in 2012 and as soon as finances were stable, I pulled the trigger and went to Loftus Road.

It hurts and shames me, as a born and raised West Londoner, that I've missed out on this for so long. I still feel like something of a fraud sitting among the QPR faithful - I haven't invested anywhere near as much time, energy and emotion (and £) in the team as they have and even if I live to 80 I probably never will. All those years before silly money kicked in were lost to me. I've bounced around SA Road and Ellerslie Road stands for matches, and had one in the Paddock - I bought my ST for next season centrally in Ellerslie Road as I feel like I'll tread on fewer long-term fans' toes there. Historically, I have nothing to compare the top flight to. I even feel like a clown posting here - but I guess everyone has to start somewhere. On a last minute plan I took my Liverpool supporting mate and his dad to Anfield on Sunday, which was my first away game. I shouldn't have been inviting the enemy among us, but it got me the ride I needed and neither him nor his dad had ever actually been. I still haven't checked up on how he felt sitting among his West London peers supporting a team from the other end of the country. Getting to applaud the guys who came over to us after the match was a fantastic end to my first chapter as a supporter. August can't come soon enough.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"I think most people like him and see his talent, but at the moment he's just not right for the system, as you point out. It's worth comparing him with Ashley Williams to see what's missing, and there's one obvious difference that stands out to me - Coates is the better tackler, but Williams leads the league in blocks. Those blocks point to a player who'll snuff out danger. Coates' tackling is useful when opponents have the ball in front of the defence, but it's less useful when the team plays a high-pressing system. Still a valuable asset, but as you point out, that combined with his lack of mobility makes him a player who's better suited to reactive, pressure-absorbing defending (and that's often where his best performances have come - see the away game against Everton, for example) which just isn't the way Rodgers wants to play. It's a shame, but it comes with a manager who's been hired specifically to introduce his style of play at the club, and unfortunately Seb looks like he'll be another talented casualty of that. 

I'd hope for a loan, I don't think there'll be a shortage of clubs wanting to take him (a loan to La Liga would be ideal, in my view) but I don't know how likely that is.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;In what way is it childish to experience disgust?

It's not, I just find it's childish to express it when such expressions are harmful to the people you share a society with. What does the expression achieve? If it's done without intent to achieving something then it seems pointless to make people feel bad for no reason. I won't comment on what such expressions of disgust would be used to achieve with intent because I think that's obvious. 

&gt;Oh tosh. There's nothing wrong with finding sexual practises disgusting, and frankly, by the meaning of the word homosexuality isn't ""normal"" - there's nothing wrong with it, it's not immoral, but it is abnormal in the same way that earning £100,000 per year or having an IQ of 130 are abnormal. Sure, yes, some of these people will have a dislike to homosexuality, but so what? Tolerance and acceptance are different things. I'm not into scatology, there I said it, that's not dehumanising a minority.

Brown eyes are ""normal"" in this reading but we don't call blue eyes ""not normal"". While blue eyes are not the norm for any given individual they a normal thing to exist within the group. It's all about context and in this context you honestly want to state that ""not normal"" is meant to be ""I fully accept being gay as a normal thing for anyone to be and I'm purely expressing that it's not the statistical likelihood they will"" when said in the context of ""I find gay sex disgusting""? 

&gt;Except, you have no evidence of that, all they've said is that they find gay sex to be disgusting, which is a completely acceptable statement to make, and they make no expression of hatred. Engage if you want, but so far you're just rehashing without any real support for your claim besides synonyms.

To use your phrase, oh tosh. It's not an acceptable statement to make, again they free to think what they like hell they are free to say what they like but to defend what they are saying as acceptable when what they are saying is either pointless and harmful or pointed and discriminatory is ridiculous. 

The context of where it was expressed and how it was done and the fact it was expressed I feel give me more than enough to make a judgement on why and the answer to that is not very nice.

true,roontish12,dalek,Dalek,"The time war ""occurred"" between 8 and 9, during the hiatus. It was a new idea introduced in the 2005 reboot series. While there may have been some events in Classic Who that hint at it, or might be prerequisites, I don't think it was ever directly referenced in 1-7. 

Edit: what better place to find out than the Tardis Data Core Doctor Who Wiki entry on the [Last Great Time War](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War)

edit 2: Looks as if the Time War was mostly fought by 8. But other significant events occur with 9 and 10. There are some ""consequences"" of the war which are discussed in the new series, for example, the Sontarins were aware of the war, but were not allowed to participate. A lot of the story of the Time War seems to be from comics and audio dramas, rather than any TV show episodes. Many people are speculating that the 50th, and the new season 8 will delve deeper into the events of the Time War. Here's hoping.

Where did I claim this?

&gt;Fact is, there is often a sense of solidarity in a ladies room in a club, girls chatting about their night, lending pins or tampons or whatever. It does feel ""private"", even though they're often strangers.

Right, so not really private, just away from men. You assume. Of course there could be males in there. You probably wouldn't know.

&gt;Perhaps people watch YOU all the time, and good luck to you with that.

No, but I do have the reasonable expectation that in public spaces people may look at me.

&gt;Casual watching is very different to being stared at while you check your roots, un-wedgie yourself or weep on your friends shoulder because you've not pulled!

I guess I'd suggest the solution to this would be to not do these things in a bathroom wash area. It seems a bit weird to do so anyway. I mean it's a bog ffs, piss, wash, leave.

If you watch the video again you'll see he encourages the officer to keep pressing, he doesn't shut it down with a simple ""I'm not obliged to answer that question and therefore will not do so"". He tells them his name is ""Sam"", invites a discussion about what does a name mean and other bollocks which presses the officer to ask again. He wants this to go on for as long as possible, you just buy into the ""oh poor chap, he's being harassed"".. he wants to be harassed, he feels it makes him more ""journalistic"" and ""investigative"".

&gt; The officer said he'd committed no crime, but just kept saying his suspension is raising because he has a camera. People have no obligation to give ID to police in that matter. Then the officer brings out the classic:
&gt; ""If you have nothing to hide, then there should be no issue"".

The officer's suspicions are raised because of the wild twists and turns the conversation takes: first he's laughing about it all, then tells them he's being harassed but teases them with info, then he calls for quiet because needs time to meditate (wtf?!) because ""he's stressed"", then starts trying to garner support from the officers about the bad billionaires conspiring to ruin our lives.

The guy comes off as a complete fruit &amp; nut bar.

You need somewhere to live. You can either rent and pay every month to increase someone else's wealth, or you can buy and pay every month to increase your own. If you can buy, I generally think it's a good idea.

That said, unless you are married, I don’t think it’s a good idea to have a joint mortgage. I bought my place with a mortgage in my own name and my girlfriend pays a portion of it to me as “rent” (informally), I would suggest the same. You should also make sure that you can afford the monthly repayments on your own in case you are left to fend for yourself. 

However, I think you may be disappointed about the amount of money you can borrow. Most lenders will not lend you much more than 5 times your salary. So max £190k. Add that to your deposit and savings and you will only be able to buy a place for £270k ish. You can check what you could borrow and for how much by using the morgage comparison on this site http://www.moneysupermarket.com/mortgages/


I would consider accepting that you may need to compromise on size and get a one-bed. There are certainly places in Zone 2 where you can get a nice one-bed for around that. 

It actually may be worth considering going slightly cheaper simply to avoid stamp duty. On a £270k place you would pay £8,100 in stamp duty. On a place 1p under £250k you would pay £2,500 in stamp duty. ",0,1369234844,null,0,1369235076,0,ca3rbxx,t3_1ety5k,t1_ca3rbxx,t3_1ety5k,null,1431071927,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

true,FireBred,derbyshire,Derbyshire,"Hello, OP,

Is your wife currently here at the moment? On a fiancée visa, work visa or student visa? If so, as I recall from painstakingly reading every bit of (often contradictory) information on the UKBA's website, this financial obligation need not be met if transferring from a work/student visa or, already has been met with a fiancée visa.

I'll agree with you that's it's geared towards only the rich. My wife (US citizen) and I are in a similar situation. 
Whilst I make more than enough to financially support her (£42,000 a year salary) due to some incorrect information we received from the UKBA (already married in the commonwealth, specifically) we arrived with no visa application having been made / accepted at Heathrow. We were questioned, her almost detained, had our bags searched. The border agent specifically asked me at one point, ""Do you happen to have dual citizenship with another EU country? If so, come in on that and we can't stop you."" 
Unfortunately, I don't. [It seems he would have been wrong anyway](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/policyandlaw/guidance/ecg/eun/eun2/#header16). 

Eventually, we were allowed to continue onwards. She now has an endorsement in her passport which is a 'code 3' which, I believe, is a way of marking her as being a risk of:
a) Overstaying her 6-month tourist entry clearance.
b) Becoming a perpetual tourist (Eurostar to Paris once every 6 months and coming back in)

With this code 3 come some not-so-nice additions such as, she can't leave the country and return in again (see, b) meaning we can't go anywhere for a weekend break or something outside of the UK &amp; Éire until we've worked out what to do. It seems, our only option is to send her back to the US, and be apart for an indefinate amount of time and collect an [insane amount of paperwork](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109270099098041096665/posts/MaWW72jz2hj)*^1

Of course, on top of this there is the added: no recourse to public funds, can't legally work. In fact, astonishingly, she can't even volunteer. 

Not long after our arrival, she found herself in hospital. It was something that required something more than the services which are free of charge for everyone. Upon her discharge she was spoken to by a, 'Foreign relations liaison' or whatever their title was. Anyway, he was essentially totting up the costs of what we'd have to repay. Upon my arrival and opening my mouth and spoke with a British accent, he confirmed we were married, ""Is this your wife?"" and as soon as I'd replied, ""yes"" he put a line through everything he'd written before and we went on our way.

I find it somewhat incredible that as my wife, she can, in theory, use and abuse the NHS as much as she likes. She just can't work to be taxed and contribute it.*^2 *^3

Anyway, to avoid all of this, we chose to attempt a '[Surinder Singh](http://webdb.lse.ac.uk/gender/Casefinaldetail.asp?id=118&amp;pageno=7)' entry. Since I can move freely anywhere in the EU/EEA - and my spouse is automatically granted the same rights as an EU citizen - we can go work anywhere we like for a period of time (6 months seems to be about right) and come back in with no financial requirements nor any other restrictions. Based on how long and expensive the applications are, this might might be worth investigating OP as ""It does not matter if the only reason the British national went to another Member State was to exercise an economic Treaty right was so that he / she could come back to the UK with his / her family members under EC law.""*^4

Best of look to you OP, and I hope some of this rant might help you out some. Helped me vent some frustration, at the very least. If it makes you feel better, the Home Office were advertising for immigration case workers (the people who process your applications and grant or deny them) based in Sheffield, their starting salary was about £17,685 or something; less than the required amount to bring a foreign spouse of their own over. 


^1 This is my friend's application for this fiancée who is currently stuck in Canada. Their application has gone missing somewhere between Canada and the NY processing office. Neither WorldBridge nor the UKBA will comment on the, ""status of an application"" until a period of 6 months has elapsed.

The city goes absolutely *mental*, but the great thing is that there are *hundreds* of shows going on at any one time ranging from one man stand up comedy to Shakespeare to circus stunt troupes. There will absolutely be shows that your boys will love!

All sorts of venues spring up - the one I used to work at is called Underbelly, which is now mostly know for the [enormous upside down purple cow](http://www.true-london.com/wp-content/uploads/udderbelly_pasture_full_size.jpg) that turns up in Bristo Square and has all sorts of shows performed in. The Big Four venues with the biggest acts are Assembly, the Pleasance, Underbelly, and Gilded Balloon, but other good names to look out for are Zoo Venues, Sweet and C Venues. As well as the paying shows you also have the Free Festival running alongside which is growing more and more and gives you free shows to see if you prefer. 

The population somewhere around doubles in Edinburgh for August, and you have to take a wander up the Royal Mile just for the experience of more street performers than you can shake a stick at.

Or go into the box office of any venue and go see the next show that's about to be on that you like the sound of.

&gt;What exactly do the lava people represent? people who have died on the Tardis, future and past? also, why are they Lava people, is it for the sake of being scary?

The Lava people are Clara, The Doctor and the 3 salvage crew members. Because of the damage, the TARDIS is ""leaking time"". We see Clara encounter herself and the doctor ""from the past"", but the TARDIS is also leaking the future. A future where Clara, The Doctor and the crew are burned alive. They are lava people because they were burned alive. 

&gt;What does ""Time will reassert itself"" mean? like.... in this context? also why is it that it means that people will turn into lava monsters?

As the Doctor says many many times, ""time is in flux"". The past and future are not ""set in stone"". His actions and the actions of his companions and the people around them can change and ""rewrite time"". This happens quite often in Dr Who. What the doctor means by ""time will reassert itself"" is that the future timeline where Clara, Doctor and the crew are burned up in the TARDIS is the most likely to occur, since they are seeing the results of it from the ""future leak"" in the Tardis. Since he knows and understands that this timeline ""can"" happen, he does whatever he can to avoid it from happening. The one lava monster that looks like two people joined together, he realizes is the two brothers, when they stand next to eachother. Meaning that when the explosion or whatever happened where they all got burned up, the two brothers were touching. If he can prevent them from ever touching in that exact manner, then time will not follow the events which lead to them getting burned up. If they do touch, the most likely future events will continue to happen (them getting burned up), so he tries to prevent them from touching. 

&gt;Do the Lava monsters have motivation? (possibly silly question)

Not really. This one I guess I can also admit is up to lazy writing. The best reason I can think of is that since the event that burned them up happened in the tardis, when it happened they got stuck in a state of perpetual living/dying. As we can gather with other fiction, most creatures (zombies for example) that are both alive and dead at the same time, seem to want to kill everything else that is actually alive. 

&gt;Why does the not-cyborg guy still remember the dad and stuff, 

He doesn't. At least for most of the episode. Up until he learns he isn't a cyborg, but is actually the other two guys brother, he has no knowledge of the father, aside from it being the other two guys father. He's not related to them in his mind.

&gt;alternatively why is the brother suddenly nicer at the end? as if the experience still had some effect on him.

Before the time reset at the end of the episode, while it's being revealed that the guy *isn't* an android, but is in fact the brother of the other two, the doctor tells the one brother ""**Never** forget this..."". And we can see at the end of the episode, even after the events were reset, *he did remember*, and so is nicer to the brother. It is also implied that because time was ""reset"", they never played the trick on the one brother, telling him he is an android, as we can see from the family photo being restored at the end, when it was ripped to exclude the one brother at the beginning. This is meant to imply that even though time was reset and the events ""didn't happen"", *they still did happen at some point, even if the characters forgot about them*. This is most likely related to Clara reading the Doctors name in the History of the Time War, but then forgetting. She didn't really forget everything, as we sort of see in Name of the Doctor.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;In what way is it harmful?

So there is no harm to someone when they hear that a natural part of who they are disgusts someone? Righty 'o.

&gt;Maybe nothing more than what it says on the tin.

I think you are stupid. Apparently that statement is neither harmful or pointed.

&gt;I don't see why anyone would feel bad over this. I certainly don't.

Ah I see because you don't feel bad no one can. That's not at all egocentric.

&gt;You can call anything which deviates from average abnormal.

But we don't, if you are going to argue a point about language then you can't ignore how that language is commonly used. It's ridiculous and speaks to seeking an excuse rather than making a point.

&gt;To claim that this is harmful, pointed, or discriminatory is putting you in lala land here matey. That some people find homosexual sex to be disgusting is completely acceptable, it's a valid position to take, and I think the sum total of their point would be that they're not very much into the idea of homosexual sex. **It's intolerant to say such**, it's just an honest expression of how they feel.

Slip of the finger their I presume? Yes it's an honest expression of how they feel and they are entitled both to feel that way and to express it if they want I'm just dealing with *why* they'd want to. You dismiss it as ""it's valid for them to feel that way so an expression of those feels is valid"" and that's just not true, there's lot of times in life in which we don't express our perfectly valid feelings for one reason or another most of them to do with how we maturely deal with living in a society full of other people.

&gt;This anti-UKIP drive is really reaching new levels of absurdity, and I say that as someone who has a lot of bones to pick with them as a party.

To coin the phrase again, oh tosh. You don't think there is an issue here but I do and while me swearing that I would say this in regards to any party that stated such talk was acceptable is likely meaningless to you it's the truth. I've said things largely along the same lines in regards to a number of toires and what they've said in and around the gay marriage debate.

So you're saying that there's harm done to people who're into scatology every time they hear that its disgusting? Does that mean we should all never say that eating shit doesn't is revolting to us? Come on man, get real.

&gt;I think you are stupid. Apparently that statement is neither harmful or pointed.

Doesn't harm me at all.

&gt;Slip of the finger their I presume?

But of course :)

I think many would perceive your message as ""It's OK to feel disgusted but you must never admit it"" and wonder, well why? They find homosexual sex to be disgusting, yet our society is quite accepting of say, two gay men making out in a park or whatever (not completely, but the world is moving that way) - and I suspect these people just feel ""Well, that's disgusting to *us* - how come we can't even express that feeling?""

This all seems to essentially boil down to the idea that there's *always* some hidden message, that we can always extrapolate a statement like what has been made to them being fascist neo-nazis who want to kill the jews and enslave the homosexuals, and it's ridiculous.

Basically it tells me that you are firmly in the 80% mortgage LTV or worse. Your max house you can afford at 80% LTV is £350k so you probably need a bigger deposit if you want something that costs more. 

It also shows that if you buy something for £350k and your mortgage rate went up to 7% you would be paying £1,788.80/month. This is the amount I recommend you can afford to pay even through this is a worst case scenario.

Millions of people tune in to watch highlights of all the Premier League games, just like millions of people tune into Champions League games and big Spanish games, because millions of people genuinely enjoy watching the sport played at a high level, regardless of which teams are playing. It's not all about tribalism.

As for what happens at the games themselves, I can't imagine a game boring enough for anyone to *applaud* anything to be honest. Crowds often do things like clap for a minute out of respect for a player (e.g. clapping in the 19th minute of a Villa game for their captain Stiliyan Petrov who has leukaemia), but if anything on the pitch makes any kind of impression, the crowd makes proper noise. Fans may clap the opposing team's performance, but only at the end of the match - why would you encourage the opposing team? I don't see what's negative about this tribalist behaviour. It doesn't preclude *appreciating* what the other team does, which many people do; it's perfectly normal to turn to your friend and say ""Fuck, that was a good goal"" when your team's just conceded. Tribalism adds to the experience, it does not take away.

I suppose in a way, it makes it impossible to go to a game as a *true* neutral, insofar as you kind of have to cheer for whichever team with whose fans you are sitting.

A Dalek insane asylum planet, childish?

So an insane old lady with an alien parasite/symbiotic attached to her chest who wants to feed the entire earth population to her prehistoric bug and who would blind and kill her own daughter to accomplish this is childish? 

The very first human time traveler in history being unsuccessful and getting stuck in the exact same spot throughout billions of years of earth history is childish? 

The (seemingly) last Mars Ice Warrior aboard a soviet nuclear submarine trying to make the Cold War the war to end all wars childish? 

There were some very deep/dark moments this season. People just seem to want to overlook them because oh Steven Moffet is ruining the series for no reason other than I think so.

*Two blokes hop out of a car.


*Start attacking a young man who is wearing a Help-for-Heroes T-shirt with 'meat cleaver' style knives.


*They're like 'animals' and drag him to middle of the road.


*Police turn up at some time (20 mins after initial attack?) and see one man dead at the scene.


*One of the meat cleaver blokes approaches armed police officer and gets shot 


*Then the other meat cleaver wielding man gets shot.

*Neither are killed but one appears to be in a serious condition.

What is unreasonable about that? Once you are in the country, the British government has certain obligations towards supporting you with taxpayer's money. The concern is that spouse visas have been abused over the years and that there have been fake marriages where the partner has disappeared (sometimes not even a divorce) after time. There have also been issues with non-EEA nationals being brought in with the spouse as their dependents. For historical reasons, once you are in the country, the state really has few ways of tracking a person. We have no identity card and we have no central registration of citizens and/or aliens.

So what the government does as part of the entry process is to take measures a) to ensure that the marriage is genuine and b) that you have sufficient means to support your spouse without needing help from the state.

Context again. Have you ever had reason to publicly state that you find scatology disgusting? Have scatologists, presuming they are straight, been fighting for equal rights to consent to engage in the act and to have the right to be able to marry their partner? 

&gt;Doesn't harm me at all.

I wasn't expecting it to but if you had ""you are stupid because you are you"" repeated at you endlessly and publicly I don't think it would be so easy to ignore. If you can that's wonderful but again not everyone is you.

&gt;I think many would perceive your message as ""It's OK to feel disgusted but you must never admit it"" and wonder, well why? They find homosexual sex to be disgusting, yet our society is quite accepting of say, two gay men making out in a park or whatever (not completely, but the world is moving that way) - and I suspect these people just feel ""Well, that's disgusting to us - how come we can't even express that feeling?""

Because they are placing their right to be disgusted by something above the right of someone else to live a normal life. If you are happy with straight people kissing in the park then you have to deal with gay people doing the same. You may not like it but no one is asking you to like it you are simply being asked to accept it as part of our social contract. 

&gt;This all seems to essentially boil down to the idea that there's always some hidden message, that we can always extrapolate a statement like what has been made to them being fascist neo-nazis who want to kill the jews and enslave the homosexuals, and it's ridiculous.

Let me ask you a question what does publicly express disgust at two gay people kissing the park actually do? You say that they wonder why they can't express their feeling but why is it that they need to in the first place? What makes expressing their disgust important enough they feel the need to place doing so above the hurt it may cause other people? 

It's not that we are trying to find a hidden message but trying to understand why someone needs to send it. I am unable to find a reason for that expression that does not boil down to hate, ignorance, or childish selfishness and your answer is ""but it's fine because it's how they feel"" which frankly isn't convincing. If you can explain to me why they need to express their disgust other than ""but they are disgusted!"" I don't think we there is much to say.

&gt;We need to actually listen to what people say, not translate everything into what we assumed they were going to say before they'd opened their gobs.

I listened to what they said and examined the context in which they were saying it and I can not find any positive reason or need for them to say it. Unless of course you find the idea of pushing back on homseuxal equality and find the need to band it from public view so ""normal"" people don't have to be made uncomfortable because their comfort is clearly the most important thing as being positive.

You seem to want to strip what has been said of every kind of context and take it purely on face value. Which is even more fantastical than you presuming that simply because I've drawn a conclusion that it's driven by homophobia that I think them fascist neo-nazis who want to kill the jews and enslave the homosexuals and that was already amazingly fantastical. 

Ironic too by the way mr ""we have to listen to what people say not translate everything into what we assume they are saying"" but don't let that trip you up I'm sure it's fine because... it's fine...

That's another example of a shitty path, because it forces you in to the place where pretty much all the road debris ends up - much of which is more than capable of causing punctures. Not to mention those types of paths inevitably result in drivers passing you far too close for comfort because they are usually not wide enough.

I'm all for segregated cycleways, but the fact is the vast majority of cycle paths are just shit and not suitable for purpose. You can't just paint a white line down the side of a road and call it done, it doesn't work like that.

&gt;An example of another cycle path you can use, is in the below YouTube video:

I was shocked and appalled at how poor the experience the visitor now gets there.

I used to be a guide across all exhibits but by far my favourite were the state rooms. There used to be around 3-4 guides based across all 7 rooms which was ample for when the visitors asked questions. When I went last year I was disgusted - I counted two people and they were both in costume - one of them appeared to be wearing a uniform fitting in with the French Revolution???!
Things just went from bad to worse - there was a small school party (primary school age) going through the state rooms and there was no-one around to answer their questions. Off my own back I showed the kids the secret door in the green room; the story behind the paintings of Charles I and his wife. Imagine my horror when I went to take them into the blue room when one of the members of staff closed the door to allow some kind of princess dressing ceremony as it is ajoined to the (awful, money making exhibit) Princess Tower (I think it's now called the Merlin Dragon Tower) - it used to be the ghost tower when I was there - it's real name is the watergate tower.

Visit /r/warwickshire for some of my own photos of when I went to the Castle last year.

The fact that they dragged Amy and Rory into Season 7 at all was a big letdown for me. They're my least-favorite companions of the new show, and could have just as easily been allowed to live on in peaceful quiet at the end of the 6th season.

“The account you have is pretty much it. Unpleasant and unhelpful Edinburgh airport baggage man (I gave him my flight and seat no, 18D, at least six times but he said he was busy and would be back shortly); a ludicrously over-reacting transport cop who’d already identified me and made it clear he’d be taking ‘no nonsense’, when I was simply asking for my ‘phone back (the Telegraph is saying i was trying to get back onto the ‘plane, for some reason).  I said I’d simply leave and one cop said; ‘best thing’ and the other said ‘not ’til I let you’.  I replied pointing out that he wasn’t letting me report my ‘phone missing nor letting me leave. At that point he arrested me with entirely un-necessary physical force.  

I’ve now seen the press reports and I’m literally astonished at the police.  I was not charged, not interviewed, did not even have statements taken, was not examined and when I was released the cops said they were taking no further action at that point. They said it was up to the Procurator Fiscal to decide if any further action was in the public interest.   Now their press folk are telling media I’ll appear in court – you obviously only appear in court if you’ve been charged. Perhaps they’d like to clarify.

The vast majority of motorists are caring and respectful of cyclists, its just the minority who spoil things.  And exactly the same can be said in reverse - a minority of cyclists are fucking idiots.

The **real** problem in this country is that far too much road space is given over to motorised vehicles.  That needs to stop.  Take a look at your average 1960s housing estate.  Look at the junctions, huge, sweeping sections of road with scant regard for pavements.  All done so that cars don't have to slow down.  We need pedestrians at the heart of road planning, followed by cyclists, motorcycles, then working vehicles, and lastly, cars.  Because the only way you'll get lazy bastards to do their 5-mile-commute on a bicycle and not a car, is to invest in high quality cycling infrastructure.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"Some things I take away:

* Don't underestimate Downing's defensive contributions.  He's pretty good at defending for a winger.  (Still not a good LB though.)

* Wisdom is living up to his name.  He won 90% of his challenges, which is pretty impressive, but which also indicates that he's tackling at the right times.  Unlike someone in a more advanced role (like, say, Hendo) however, he doesn't get to choose when he has to pressure the ball/man.  As a right back he *has* to pressure in a lot of situations, and to have maintained such a high tackling percentage shows great composure.

* Suarez is a great player for BR's system, in that he's very good at winning the ball high up the pitch.  The most memorable moment, of course, was when Daniel Agger sent him through clear on goal and he bottled it, sending the shot wide, but on the ensuing goal kick robbed the CB, nutmegged him, and scored with that outside-of-the-foot curler, shutting the Norwich fans up in the process.

* Joe Allen is more capable of playing as a DM than I think most people here believe.  He's a smart player, and at 22, that's a great sign for how he'll develop.

* Jose is fucking boss at tackling.  One of my favorite things in the world is watching a winger dribble past Jose, and I can just see the dispossession coming.  If they take a touch too far, Jose just steps in, very cool and calm, and just bosses them out of the way with his strength and goes and collects the ball.

* Stevie G is fantastic :)

* Glen is one of our hardest players to dribble past.  To hell with anybody who doesn't think he's a top 10 RB in the world on his day.

* Lucas... &lt;3",0,1369241964,null,0,false,0,ca3u12s,t3_1etvbo,t1_ca3u12s,t3_1etvbo,null,1431070655,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

The problem with going by average is that it ignores regional and gender differences. It also doesn't tell us much about who is going to be a burden on the taxpayers or not. It might seem reasonable to you, but it might not seem reasonable to the recent university grad or working single mother.

I would be the first to support restrictions if the government could show that people under the levels they've chosen go on benefits, put unreasonable strain on the NHS, and that the previous requirements led to abuses by immigrant spouses of British citizens.

It should be a fairly easy thing to prove. One of the requirements for ILR under the old rules (rules that are still in effect for people who entered before summer of 2012) is to show that they didn't depend on public monies during their FLR. If there are an unreasonable amount of people who are claiming benefits, then it is a totally different discussion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't give a toss if it's something that gay people want, declaring that it's about equality; I've never heard so much bollocks in all my life. my protest is based upon a couple of principles:

1.) I'm genuinely afraid of the far reaching consequences of this. Irrespective of any safeguards being placed within the bill, I find it offensive that the palace of westminster is interfering with religious mandate in exactly the same way as they did with women prriests; our consitution in this country speicifcally states a seperation of church and state for an *extremely* good reason, and my largest fear of this, is that the minute a vicar refuses to marry a gay couple in his congregation, he'll be taken to court, or harrassed until he gives in, thereby forcing him to compromise his religious convictions - which *no one* should be allowed to do.

2.) We're talking about the church here. The only people who should have a say in whether people should be allowed to get married in a chapel, are those that attend services on a regular basis, contribute to the upkeep of the congregation and live, more than anything, a christian life as a part of the community. I find it offensive that the concept of marriage has been trivialised to the point that many people - gay or straight - simply get married in a church because their fiancee has always wanted a church wedding. You want a church wedding? Fine. Cut your bullshit and read a bible. I find it incredible that Westminster threatened to ""review giving marriage licences to churches"" if they didn't consider their stance on gay marriage. That for me was more insidious than anything else.

3.) Why don't gay people open their own churches, exactly, if the issue is *that* important?

For me, I don't care if you're gay; people appear to have a *real* problem with me expressing my view that while I have gay friends, the lifestyle isn't for me, and I find the *act* of gay sex, or two men (or women - I don't discriminate) pretty bloody weird. Liberals can't accept that though.

This country stands at a precipice; as more laws are put into place to ensure gay people *can't* be discriminated against, it sets gay people apart; changes to the rape laws, or domestic violence laws that in many cases *still don't recognise men* cause a massive disparity, and then there's the fact that men *still* don't have a legal right to at least *talk* about the subject of keeping or aborting a child (thus essentially forcing him into financial hardship for the next 18 years of your life. Ever been an 18 year old that got your dick wet and made a silly mistake? I have. I'm just lucky that the girl who chose to *keep* my son really wasn't into the idea of me being in her life for the rest of it, and found a decent, understanding fella; and I should preface this that irrespective of that outcome, I *still* offered to support her and the child, and do whatever it took.)

Liberalism is insidious. In its pursuit of equality, it promotes disparity.",0,1369244994,null,0,false,0,ca3v7y7,t3_1es1rm,t1_ca3v7y7,t1_ca3uyjq,null,1431070022,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

*Analyse* is correct US, anyway. OED spelling uses *-ize* instead of *-ise* because it's closer to the original Greek root, *-izo*. Words with a *y* instead (like *analyse*, *paralyse*, etc.) don't stem from that root prefix, but an actual verb *λύω*/*lyo* (see http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/λύω), and as such, shouldn't (in either British- or US-English) have a *z*.

From H. W. Fowler's 'A Dictionary of Modern English Usage':
&gt;**-IZE, -ISE, IN VERBS**. In the vast majority of the verbs that end in *-ize* or *-ise*, the ultimate source of the ending is the Greek *-izo*, whether the particular verb was an actual Greek one or was a Latin or French or English imitation, &amp; whether such imitation was made by adding the termination to a Greek or another stem.

--

&gt;It must be noticed, however, that a small number of verbs, some of them in very frequent use, like *advertise*, *devise*, &amp; *surprise*, do not get their *-ise* even remotely from the Greek *-izo*, &amp; must be spelt with *-s-*.

**edit:** another source

From Eric Partridge's 'Usage and Abusage':
&gt;You will be safe if you make every verb, every derivation noun or participial adjective, conform to the *-z-* type, for this suffix comes, whether direct or via Latin or French, from the Greek *-izein*: to employ *-ise* is to flout etymology and logic. Moreover, whether the spelling is *-ise*, or *-ize*, the pronunciation is *-ize*: another rule for using it.

I feel there's an oversight here in Partridge's not including the point made in the second Fowler quote, but the book is essentially an updated (and slightly less archaic-sounding) ADMEU and as such, anyone finding themselves unsatisfied with his explanation would do best to check Fowler's text.

""The Tories became associated with repression of popular discontent after 1815. But later, the Tories underwent a fundamental transformation under the influence of Robert Peel, who was an industrialist rather than a landowner. Peel in his 1834 'Tamworth Manifesto' outlined a new 'Conservative' philosophy of reforming ills while conserving the good. The subsequent Peel administrations have been labelled ""Conservative"" rather than ""Tory"", but the older term remains in use.

When the Conservative Party split in 1846 on the issue of Free Trade, the protectionist wing of the party rejected the term Conservative. They preferred to be known as Protectionists or even to revive the older term 'Tory' as an official name.

In this day and age I doubt you'll experience any racism. Particularly in the student areas around South Belfast which have many, many people from all around the world. Asians, Romanians, Polish, African to name but a few few of the types of people I come across in a daily basis around here. 

I'll be honest, there are parts of Belfast and NI I wouldn't recommend staying in, and where foreigners have been the target of racist abuse in the past, but I wouldn't let that put you off. Racist attacks and racist abuse aren't very frequent. I think you'd be very unlucky to end up as a victim of racist abuse. 

The last significant racist attack that made international headlines here was in 2009 when a very small group of racist loyalists decided to attack homes that members of the Roma community lived in. It was a fairly isolated set of events, and the South Belfast community stood up to the culprits and guarded their homes. 

Assuming you would be coming here to study at either Queen's University Belfast or University of Ulster, you wouldn't at all be out of place since thousands of international students come here every year to study. You should have the opportunity to stay with other international students, and also to socialise with local students as well.

The difference is that Christianity at least has built up a secular culture around it that, instead of dictating to, it must now serve. As this secular culture grew over the last several hundred years, so the excesses of the Christian church did shrink.

This is the failing of the Muslim community. Of course they're not all terrorists. The vast majority aren't. But they have a serious problem in their culture that fosters terrorism. The only effective defence religious moderates have against fundamentalists in their own ranks is in building up a powerful secular community around that religion that accepts their core values while rejecting the dogma.

They have a history of shilling on reddit, for example: /u/iambritishman /u/peteshambles /u/greatbritishe /u/jononreddit /u/macbooksforever /u/bringyourpassport /u/silentnights4the. Notice how they create a new account for each post, and make a comment in another thread to try and disguise themselves as legitimate.

First of all: I never meant to suggest that Dembele had a poor season.  Ignore that this is the internet which usually only has two settings (circlejerk and mob-hate) - Dembele was one of our better players for half of the season and then was up-and-down whilst he battled tiredness and injury.  ...but regardless, I feel that his ultimate contribution has been overrated by a lot of Spurs fans.

&gt; If someone complained that Tom Huddlestone doesn't surge forward with the ball enough, wouldn't you find that a bit silly?

What about Huddlestone's tackling ability and pace, which are probably the main criticisms of him?  If you only judge a player by what he does well then of course you're going to find your judgements of a player are positive.

Anyway, I'm reluctant to become bogged down in a discussion on this because ultimately this will come down to something subjective that the statistics don't show.  The Dembele of my eye has too often been hesitant to play the pass early enough, to the team's detriment; if this is not ""his game"" then he needs to change his game (tell Ryan Giggs that a player can't amend his game past the age of 19).  I'm not even talking about 40yd balls through two-banks of four; just moving the ball on first- or second-touch when needed.  To be considered a top player, I feel he needs to learn better when to use his natural power and ability to beat players and when to give the ball sooner.  I think he can do this and that is exciting - but he hasn't done it *yet*.

It's the real reason he has spent so much time stalling his deaths as Ten and Eleven, as he is steadily becoming darker. And when anyone, even his oldest enemies such as Davros point it out to him, he has nothing to say in response.

Of course, if I was entirely right, wouldn't he have gone to a permanent  death much more willingly?

This though, so far at least, seems to be nothing more than murder with a poor excuse for raising awareness of their home country's plight. Their religion is barely mentioned other than to say ""We swear to [god almighty]"".

Not that I disagree with calling it this, technically, however, I think a lot of people still associate Terrorist = Al Queda, Osama Bin Laden and so forth. They think (and don't take this the wrong way), that it's bigger than it is. It's using a word to sensationalise what happened. The word needs to be used carefully because to a lot of people it has a lot of connotations now.

I'm not entirely certain that two people killing someone for revenge over something that is happening in their own country is what I would call terrorism though - for all we know, the family of one of them has been killed and they went and did this in response. Until it's clear who they are, if they're affiliated with any such groups, and what caused them to do this, it's not really right to start saying it's Terrorism.

Seriously please tell me where, I promised a friend I'd help him hire graduates over the summer for his company, I'll be looking for people who will have a good aptitude to be able to pick up programming languages such as Erlang and F#.  It's not a you must have a 140+ IQ points thing, but you must be used to logic.  He is talking about a £35-45k budget each, and it looks like he is after 3.  Preferably who'll work well in a brand new team environment with a bunch of old farts.

&gt;there are far more applicants for PhD placements than available 

Oh that's what your thinking, well in the world of fully funded academics, maybe so, but we are talking in the context of business right?

&gt;The shortage of STEM graduates is really an invention of the CBI because whilst there isn't a shortage - the glut isn't as bad as in other subjects and therefore the wages and conditions aren't completely eroded yet.

It's often not just graddies, if your in say, low power electronic engineering, a really important yet very esoteric field, the hard bit is finding people who've 2-3 years experience, because frankly they need training after their education.  But the problem is that training a new graddie is seriously expensive, and something not often recognised by the graddie themselves.  This creates a nasty cycle where businesses fail to invest in the first stage training.

But just look at the wage for something like 'Graduate C#' in London
http://www.theinquirer.net/jobs-search-page?Keywords=c%23+graduate&amp;AndOr=0&amp;LTxt=London%2c+South+East&amp;Radius=15

That is one hell of a shortage, no one expects a graddie in that field to be remotely competent at first.

As someone who works in *Software/Embedded Hardware* there is a massive shortage of graddies with *appropriate* majors, if you can only afford £30k a year.

When you consider what £30k a year is in relation to the median wage, that implies a shortage right?

I come to reddit to have fun just like everyone else, and leaving a comment in every moderated thread is really going to kill the experience for me. 

I'll leave you with a mod log of the last day or so for myself in this subreddit, I hope you can see just what you're asking me to commit to.

Moderating is not particularly interesting or glamorous. I've spent something like three years as a mod here, making sure your posts stay out of the spam filter, reviewing and approving every single report (it would really help if people sent a message saying why they reported something actually), keeping the place free of spam and image memes, and making sure that racist trolls don't ever take root.

At least half the posts below are going to get me an abusive reply, or an exhausting drawn-out argument. If I'm making 150 mod comments every single week (that's way more than I actually make as a normal user), and getting 75 ""fuck you mod"" comments every week, I'm gone. Below are the common, boring mod actions. A post like this one happens once in a blue moon.

I am of course happy to discuss anything about this subreddit, reddit, moderation or anything else, but I'd greatly prefer if you messaged the group moderator mail so I'm not put on the spot (link is in the sidebar).

I'm trying to pick my words carefully here - I spend a lot of time performing a volunteer service, I don't owe this subreddit any more.

true,loquerion,null,null,"All of the Directors recent and present think that 3 hours is the perfect size for a convention RPG game. The RPG slots have always been 3 hours at Q-Con, and average 3 hours at other comparable conventions as well. People get bored or fidgety after that and it means that you can comfortable fit a couple of games into one day.

However, we've had 3 consistent complaints from the RPG community about RPGs at Q-Con over the past few years:

1) The game slots are not long enough and should be 4 hours
2) There isn't a Saturday night gaming slot
3) The RPG room is too noisy to play RPGs in
[I'm not including the complaints along the lines of ""I arrived 1 hour late for sign ups and there's no games left""]

Additionally, there are some ""living world"" RPGs which are making big impressions on the local convention scene. These games are globally scored, and have rules about how long the games must last (to ensure that playing a game gives the same experience the world over). The required game slots for these games is 4 hours, and a significant number of the long term GMs have insisted that this must be the case for their games to be run.

So in response to the complaints and new requirements, we're going to try to run 4 hour games slots, have added a Saturday night RPG slot, and have moved RPGs to a private building to isolate them from the noise of the rest of the convention.

The games themselves, with the exception of the ""living world"" games have been briefed to last only 3 hours. This should ensure that only in a rare few cases will the game realistically run on so long. The slots themselves are separated by 30 minutes which should allow time to do the dash.. there will be more staff present during RPG signups slots, and more table space to make signing up a lot quicker.

While I don't think it will be received as well by the majority of people, we do have a duty to at least try and appease those who constantly complain. It's very difficult to know, because people tend only to complain when they see a problem, instead of when they see something that's done right... Time will tell, and if it sucks, they'll be back to 3 hours again next year :)",0,1369250984,null,0,false,0,ca3xmiq,t3_1est5y,t1_ca3xmiq,t1_ca3x0i1,null,1431068889,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

The big factor is that they are moving so slowly compared to cars which make it difficult to pass them especially for large/long vehicles which struggle to see them weaving in and out of traffic whenever they want, riding 2 foot from the curb, then when you do pass, they get on the path at the next red light and then rejoin in front of the traffic, so all the cars have to try and pass again. One thing I see daily is cyclists in the middle lane of 3 or 4 lane city roads. Busy road, 40 MPH limit, loads of lorries trying to move through tightly packed traffic, and you get some prat sitting in the middle lane at a red light, in the centre of the road! The traffic moves off at a steady 10 miles per hour until he decides to get to the left lane, biking is supposed to ease congestion but I see it cause plenty.

Just thought we'd chip in as we've been tweeted about what's going on in this thread and thought I'd drop a few comments in relation to our website.

We're new. Or rather I'm pretty new. My name is Daniel and I oversee the social media side of the website and paid advertising. I started with the website a month ago and everything is ran rather leanly from Google Campus as an online magazine/platform for writers. Planet Ivy used to use an ""online marketing consultancy firm"" which as far as I can tell was a spam setup subcontracted out in India which promised ""AMAZING RESULTS"". 

A quick bit of homework showed that yes, they were spamming on our behalf, as you've mentioned. Because of such I had us cut all ties with them and unfortunately as we don't have access to those accounts all we can do is hold up our hands and say yes, we're responsible. We might not have known what they were doing but we did use their services as they were recommended by another start up. We also had the problem with the writers themselves were (maybe still are) posting links and trying to get themselves more views. This in itself we will find problematic because ultimately we want to reward them based on traffic but we don't want to encourage them to go around spamming and getting our domain a bad name. 

We've ran legitimate adverts on Reddit and a lot of other websites as cheaply as possible to get feedback from people about our site. 

Our goal is essentially to write good articles that people will want to share. Most of our traffic comes from Facebook and Twitter. It accounts for 70% of it a month to be honest so yes we cover current events and anything that people would be inclined to tell someone down the pub.

I can assure you that all our content is NOT just lifted from other sources and any writer found to be plagiarising articles or what not will be dismissed from our network. We may link places as original sources but we will have our writer's own opinion and any addition information we find included too.

We don't have the time, nor the resources, to sit around on Reddit all day posting links hoping some will stick. But yes we do hope that people enjoy our work and find it worth sharing. 

If you don't want people posting links to our website here that's entirely down to you. But we're not a spam site, we write all our own content, and we work incredibly hard to make something so simple as a finished article come together with writers all over the country.

You seem to miss the point.  It wasn't all the Irish.  But it was them that kept quiet, provided alibis, provided money and safehouses.  Without the support of the people the IRA could never have existed.  Eventually that silent support ended up getting them into power, which is where many remain today, despite the murders they committed or ordered.

The same goes for many in the Muslim community.  They enable it through 'charitable donations', silence, moral support online or any of the other same reasons that provided what the IRA saw as the legitimisation of their cause by the people.

Islam is not a race, a minority or disability.  It is something someone chooses to believe.  ",0,1369251247,null,0,false,0,ca3xqei,t3_1eu5ke,t1_ca3xqei,t1_ca3xgqv,null,1431068838,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

A ducks physical design is not well suited to being a creature of large mass. The power / weight ratio would no longer fall in its favor, and so it would become flightless. Likewise, its legs are not practical for lifting such large bulk, and would be easily damaged. Finally, it's physical characteristics do not allow it to easily maneuver over rough terrain (suited more for sandy banks). I would gain the advantage by running it onto broken ground, and then attacking from its blind spots to disable it's legs.

A horse is likewise unsuited to be a small creature... horses knees are terribly weak, and with the reduction in overall size, their bones would be as brittle as tooth picks. Since there are no duck sized horse shoes, they would be significantly disadvantaged running over hard ground, like concrete. I would initially run from them over concrete, and wait for a few to fall as then chased - then I would turn and charge through the pack (horses wouldn't see me coming as they have no direct frontal vision), while stamping on as many as I could. Once I broke out the other side, I would repeat the process until all were kindling.

When fighting both at once of course, I would hide and wait for them to weaken each other as much as possible... then I would pounce from the shadows and finish off whatever was left.

I just graduated (hopefully) with a first in Physics, but was unsure about whether to do a PhD or programming and the only programming role I found was generic C# for a pretty low wage (lower than £35k) - mainly because a lot of the places only really consider CS grads - which wasn't terribly appealing.

 But Erlang and F# sound interesting - I started looking at Haskell on the advice of my friends who said it's like life-changing etc. but I haven't got far enough to really appreciate the differences of functional programming yet.

I wasn't aware that many businesses used functional programming languages - C# and Java seem the most common by far - which I suppose is why you used C# as your example.

You have a point in niche fields, but surely that will always be a problem? Also £25k is a reasonable salary but it's in London as well, so it's not as amazing as it might seem (although that is the lower end to be fair)

&gt; As well as being generally less likely to receive a custodial sentence than
men, women also tend to receive shorter terms of imprisonment: in 1995
the average length of prison sentences imposed for indictable offences at
the Crown Court was 17.7 months for women aged 21 or over and 22
months for men. The ave rage length was lower for females convicted of
burglary, fraud and forgery, robbery, and theft and handling, but higher for
criminal damage and drug offences.

Actually, I'm confusing myself a bit here. If Ghosting records a person's last thoughts the moments before they die, then Tenth would have to have been the one to get her ghosting device out of her suit and hold onto it until the moment he gives her the sonic. Would this mean that he either assumed that the time wouldn't run out for her ghosting as he was able to get it from her screwdriver to plug in, or did he skip the chance of time being rewritten and just go straight to the day he gives it to her and give it to her?

true,PancakeDoomsday,lfc12,,"&gt;Echoes of Carroll in these comments. That and the lack of anything to say about his football ability points to Coates leaving.

Exactly, if Rodgers saw Coates fitting into the system he'd say something about this, expand on the abilities Coates possesses that he likes and would say he definitely has a role to play or could play. Instead he's merely praising Coates' loyalty and determination to get into the side because those are the characteristics he rates highest in him. 

Seems almost inevitable that we'll sell Coates, a loan would only be in an effort to increase his stock and perhaps give him to a club that may want him, but there's no real point in loaning him in the event that the club we loan him too doesn't work out. Best for all parties if we sell him.

Shame to lose a promising South American player because they all seem to be a close-knit group - but maybe that means we'll get another Uruguayan player so Suarez still as a compatriot to fly home with, nudge nudge wink wink Cavani (pipe dreaming cause it's almost transfer window time). Still, I believe Coates will do well wherever he goes so long has he goes to a club suited for him.

Cardiff has quite a compact city centre. The [castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Castle) is literally [at the end of one of the main shopping streets](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Entrance_to_Cardiff_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_956979.jpg).

There has been some major investment in Cardiff recently, there are several new shopping centres and of course the [Millennium Stadium](http://www.millenniumstadium.com/home.php) is near the city centre too.

A couple of miles drive from the city centre is [Cardiff Bay](http://cardiffbay.co.uk/index.php/en/), a major new waterfront development with lots of restaurants and bars, there's also a Doctor Who tourist attraction there.

Caernarfon also has a [castle](http://www.caernarfon-castle.co.uk/). If you are driving from Caernarfon towards Llangollen take the main [A55 road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A55_road) and stop at [Llandudno](http://www.visitllandudno.org.uk/) for a few hours. Llandudno is a typical Victorian-era seaside resort.

Llangollen has a [heritage steam railway](http://llangollen-railway.co.uk/page.php?id=1). It's worth checking the dates it operates on before you visit. Near Llangollen you have the [Pontcysyllte Aqueduct](http://www.pontcysyllte-aqueduct.co.uk/) which is on the Llangollen canal and is a world heritage site.

Wrexham is quite a small town. [St Giles' Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Giles%27_Church,_Wrexham) in Wrexham is the burial place of [Elihu Yale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elihu_Yale), benefactor of [Yale College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College) in Connecticut. In the town there's also the new [Eagles Meadow](http://www.eagles-meadow.co.uk/) shopping centre. Two miles south of Wrexham you have [Erddig](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/erddig/) country house.

Edit: for anyone wondering, the deleted comments are someone claiming that Islamaphobia is justified because ""muslims are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime"" and then linking to [these](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/race-and-the-criminal-justice-system--3) statistics to try and prove their point (despite these statistics relating to broad racial categories and not religion)",0,1369254829,null,0,1369255112,0,ca3z7y1,t3_1eu5ke,t1_ca3z7y1,t1_ca3ys18,null,1431068138,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It will pass eventually. The IRA bombed Woolwich once, and the NF went round stabbing black people. And all that of course was tame by the standards of early 20th century political violence.

As to why people do this at all, this is a useful analysis of political violence. In this case fascism, but islamic fundamentalist terrorism is tbf more or less a variant on the same theme.

&gt;""The prospective fascist may long for the destruction of himself no less than for that of the adversaries, destruction being a substitute for his deepest and most inhibited desires … He realises that his solution is no solution, that in the long run it is doomed. Any keen observer could notice this feeling in Nazi Germany before the war broke out. Hopelessness seeks a desperate way out. Annihilation is the psychological substitute for the millennium [i.e. for utopia] – a day when the difference between the ego and the others, between poor and rich, between powerful and impotent, will be submerged in one great inarticulate unity.

 - We may have won the championship, but our football was dull. Pereira was trying to play the same way as Villas Boas without the same success. 

 - ECL was disappointing. We had better team than Malaga.

 - The main reason is that we have some players with very good prospects for the future. Nonetheless, those players didn't achieve what was expected at the beginning of the season. James, for example, is the same player as he was at the end of last season. Not better or worse, just the same. Defour is the same story. And is vital for the economic sustainability of the club, for players to reach their maximum potential.

In conclusion, there aren't many strong arguments for him to leave, but I feel that my opinion is consensual between Porto fans. If he gets the job, I would be supporting Pereira and, of course, Everton as well.

Having just been at a martial arts session doing some knife work my immediate gut reaction was disbelief at the lack of action. How could people stand idly by? Yes I understand the bystander effect and for one person to intervene is quite high risk, yet earlier in the year we had the story of customers at a bookmakers restraining an armed robber. Last new years eve I was in London when a drunk started beating a pensioner, surrounded by people better placed to contain the guy yet I was first to jump in...

That's why he needed to die. Has nothing to do with the John Hurt doc. How do I know this? The Doctor basically tells us in The Wedding of River Song. ""Imagine if there was a man who knew a terrible secret. How would you erase that secret?"" ""If I had to... I would destroy the man itself."" 

Then again, I do also think it's 12 because John Hurt says he's part of the trinity. 10, 11 and...12 of course since 9 won't be there. 

&gt;In Nightmare in Silver, the Emperor feels sorry for the poor blighter who had to blow up an entire galaxy to stop the cybermen. Was that the Doctor?

I thought it was implied that the Emperor did that. 

&gt;In Journey to the Centre of the Tardis, when Clara reads the Doctor's name she says ""So that's who"", as if she recognises the name, and now knows who did something that she already knows about. This implies that it is something that happened to the Earth. Perhaps 'Storm' is relevant here - is the Doctor responsible for the biblical flood? Was it ten billion humans that he killed? Was he the storm that caused it? Is the Doctor's name actually Noah? Perhaps this is why he has such affection for the Earth and humanity, above all others - guilt.

Sorry, but I doubt that Doctor Who would run with a biblical story that clashes with facts/reality. 

Now, another theory is that the Doctor saw his own future in the untempered schism. Presumably he saw it when he was 8 if we parallel it with the Master, but we can't be certain of that. 

Also, some more even further back theory crafting: in series 4, the Doctor states that he had visited the Medusa Cascade when he was 90 years old. Also in series 4, the soothsayer says that his name burns in the cascade of Medusa herself. (maybe Trenzalore is located there? who knows). But this, on the other hand, would lend weight to the 0th Doctor theory. 90 years old is before we ever see Hartnell. And he went to the Medusa Cascade. Additionally, we also know that he closed a rift there, single-handedly. If this all is somehow linked to this, that would seriously be some overarching shit like never seen before.

You can't really say the same about our midfield without Dembele this season. Just look at the games where we were missing him. We looked more than a little clueless going forward at times and so many chances to break forward fizzled out in the Parker spin cycle.

I think I found this to be the most interesting fact of the whole article. I tend to forget that for the most part we did limit chances fairly well; I'm curious what our oppositions' shots-on-target:goal ratio was. If my memory is accurate, we had several games where we'd dominate but couldn't finish and the other clubs' first, and sometimes only, chance was converted. Or perhaps that occurred more the season before than this season; or maybe that's just been a majority of Liverpool games the past 3-4 seasons and I'm just meshing these occurrences together because it seems so characteristic of us lately.

Still though, most shots in the box/least shots given up in the box are VERY promising statistics to build upon.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"Actually that's not true, there are hundreds of British Muslims fighting in Syria right now against the Assad regime which is Muslims vs. Muslims and this has happened before in Chechnya, Bosnia and elsewhere. It's evident that Muslims do get involved when other Muslims are being slaughtered regardless of who the perpetrator is. One thing I remember was that most Muslims thought Afghanistan was reasonable because it was a proportionate response to 9/11 (and also the Taliban were very harsh) and so they brushed aside ideas of an existential war by the West (led by America) on Islam/Muslims. Then Iraq happened and the death toll was so high and then you had Abu Ghraib, the Mahmudiyah massacre, Guantanamo Bay etc. coupled with the fact no WMDs were found which changed things completely. Then a lot of Muslims thought Iraq was just done by America to punish Muslims and other Western powers including the UK were complicit in it. 

Personally I think there'll be a handful of Muslims who will still bear huge resentment over Iraq enough to do stuff like this in the future but they will most likely be caught before they get to execute it because they tend to be acting on passion rather than knowing what they're doing. Also in the UK imams and other Muslims have reported suspected terrorists to the police before they've gotten the chance to carry out their plan. 

In terms of a long term anti-terrorism strategy, I think democratisation of Muslim countries (especially ones which are heavily subject to US influence) is helpful because leaders will begin to better reflect public opinion in Muslim countries than what was previously the case. Hosni Mubarak for example was a complete lapdog of the US and failed to represent any of the frustrations of the 80m Egyptians living under his dictatorship. Morsi better reflects this and as Egypt's democracy matures this will improve. Same for Pakistan under Musharraf's dictatorship vs. Pakistan under Nawaz Sharif. This also weakens the influence of underground terrorist groups which seek to prey on the feelings which unelected leaders often fail to acknowledge. It also adds legitimacy and credibility to peaceful political activism as a means of seeking change without needing to resort to violence. The Arab revolutions of 2011 and the high turnout and enthusiasm of the Pakistani elections show that Muslims around the world definitely still believe in this though. Even the Syrian protesters remained peaceful for 9 months even though the military responded with violence immediately.",0,1369261411,null,0,false,0,ca41vh5,t3_1eulbv,t1_ca41vh5,t1_ca415bs,null,1431066887,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He would be a phenomenal signing for us, and, in my opinion, possibly the only offensive player we'd need to purchased this summer. Gerrard/Lucas/Henderson/Allen/Eriksen/Jonjo (if he's not loaned out) - 6 players for 3 positions. I know we need cover at CDM for Lucas, but I'd forego that purchase until next January/summer if it meant we got Eriksen. Henderson's not terrific there - his future's certainly as a more attacking player - but if need be I think he's adequate cover for all three of our center midfield positions. 

the video does do a good job at showing our transition from defense (4-3-3) to attack (4-2-3-1) and how Eriksen would go from CM to LAM, but it got me excitedly fantasizing about having a midfield where we rotate one up-and-coming AM for another in Eriksen/Hendo and IT JUST SEEMS TOO PERFECT OKAY?!? 


Anyways, Eriksen will undoubtedly become a great player wherever he goes and will help win trophies, the question comes down to if FSG will pay the fee and if Eriksen wants to be part of BR's plans.

The issue is, how do I sort through all the CVs?  If you've been already working in the industry, your not going to be a graddie, you'll already have learnt stuff and be wanting more dosh, and therefore over-experienced for the role.  Or conversely you will have had some exposure to working life, but not in a pertinent field.  This then means I have a choice between training someone who has been educated, shown already that they have been able to learn independently to a certain standard (ie their transcript of grades from uni) vs an unknown.

How much time can I save by throwing them away?  Let's be honest interviewing people and reading a CV, you expect them to be able to demonstrate why they are a good fit.  People who've got a good degree (sorry English Lit students) from an institute that is good in that field demonstrates that.

Call me a bastard cunt as much as you want, but sadly this is standard practice.  If you can suggest why businesses would spend the time, because it really does cost money, especially if its for an area your struggling to hire in, because their wages are already high, please do.

My advice to you will only apply if your wanting to go in to software / micro electronics.  But if you do; use your spare time.  Find the nearest charity or whatever and do their IT for them.  Don't just go in and install open office on ubuntu, really spend time, find what they need, save them money, design simple spreadsheets, maybe websites.  But most of all understand what they want.  You might be appalled a non-profit spends £500 on MS Office licenses, but if they make really good fliers or whatever, it pays for it'self.  Same goes with thinking lets go to *my favourite OS today* if they aren't technically sharp, it might cost them thousands of £s in hours lost re-training staff.

With developers, IT staff, or engineers of any type too many have religious beliefs, these people are blight on the profession, they *victim blame*, if you can't understand how to use XYZ you are thick isn't good for business.

As much as it is a stereotype lots of people who are really smart lack these soft skills.  Find something to demonstrate you have those 'real world' abilities, whilst being remotely related to the field you wish to get in to.

The other thing is, you need to be mindful of the path you try to take, and not waste time butting up against closed doors, I wasted a lot of time failing to get on big companies graddie schemes because I had 5 GCSEs.  When I met my senior boss to be, I didn't realise I'd passed the interviews already, it was just a formality, he was reading my CV for what felt like an eternity but must have been only 30 seconds.

I'd love to be made a fool, but I find the idea of Wisdom defending the flanks against the likes of Hazard troubling. 

If Wisdom doesn't go out on loan he should certainly be given League Cup games, but unless Kelly and Johnson are both injuries/suspended I don't know if he'll get many (if any) starts in the league next season. 

As I see it: Wisdom's competing with our other youths for 3rd choice RB (and he seems to be leading at the moment) and Kelly is 2nd choice RB, 4th choice CB (depending on our transfers, but if he is eventually going to make the push into the center now's the time to give him starts there)

Right now the quant space is an oddity.  People are still using C++ incredibly badly.  I've never seen a well written quant lib, in fact I'm now conditioned to be scared that when someone says ""our quant lib is really well architected"" that they just don't realise how bad it is, and it is in fact far worse than the others, which are shit.

This leaves a huge gap where practically anything could have happened.

The news channels only do it to keep people watching - because we have evolved to pay attention to things which scare us.

No gore would be a start. No one needs to see some poor guy decapitated while trying to stay informed. 

The next step would be ending the fascination of trivial non-stories about the private lives of relatively insignificant people. Or stories which purely exist to push someones agenda. Who really cares about Abu Qatada enough to want to watch his trial progress step by step month after month? Does it matter? Is it presented with the intention of making it a Theresa May success story? Or perhaps to make the idea of bending human rights laws more palatable to the voting public? ... I don't know, but I really don't get how it affects anyone but Mr Qatada. It feels more like EastEnders than journalism. 


Saying that, I think these sorts of videos should be available to watch - but on the internet, instead of in the living room where the whole family could be watching. It seems like TV tries to justify showing this sort of thing because people can watch it on the internet anyway. I would rather a news program to have a sense of taste. The rule should be: Would you feel comfortable if your grandma or child were to watch it?

Why do we need to give people targets of 'x jobs applied for', when it's inevitably going to lead to rushed applications for jobs they don't want.

Far better to ease up, and let people put effort into fewer, higher quality applications, targeted at the jobs they're suited for.

Does any recruiter really want to deal with an extra hundred applications from people just going thru the motions to hit arbitrary targets?

In the end, I think there's going to be more people and fewer jobs in the future, and we're going to have to install some radical changes, not just blame the jobless for being jobless.  We either accept that a certain number of people will always be unable to find work, and just deal with the fact that, as a society, we need to offer basic support to live, or we hand over the poor to the aristocracy as a replacement for the foxes that they can't hunt any more.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Feel free to downvote, it's the nature of Reddit. If the community doesn't like it, it falls away.

This is the most common argument against memes, but it has one main problem - the time it takes to vote on memes (and images in general) is far less than the time it takes to vote on, say, an article.

And because Reddit makes things visible in terms of the rate of upvotes (over time), images/memes are ranked higher, and visible for longer.

&gt; What makes memes popular is that they can sometimes summarize an entire discussion in a short and sometimes humorous way.

Well, yes and no; what makes memes popular is that they're the in-jokes of the internet, and everyone likes an in-joke they understand. They're also popular because, as above, they're easy to vote on. As for whether they summarize discussions in short/humourous ways? Perhaps, if done well; but there's plenty of times they aren't done well, and/or the 'discussion' they're making isn't worthwhile 

E.g. there was a Pushing Patrick meme here a few weeks ago after the two 0-0 draws, saying ""why don't we take the ball / and put it in the back of the net"". (It was reported, hence not visible) Does it add anything useful? No. Does it say anything that hasn't already been said? No. It's just an image equivalent of when people used to make their own post-match self-posts on their match thoughts. 

All in all, I don't think the community loses anything by banning memes as individual submissions (memes in comments are fine, IMO). And I think that if we're discouraging memes, it has to be via banning, not via downvotes, because of what I said above.",0,1369275378,null,0,false,0,ca46uou,t3_1ev47l,t1_ca46uou,t1_ca43nup,null,1431064469,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

As for why your ""statistic"" is flawed I suggest you consult an expert in methodology, or at least read Bad Science or something, anything. The frequency with which a family member is in the proximity of your firearm is orders of magnitude greater than the frequency with which an attacker is. Your ""point"" is a non-point; it is invalid. Your family is much more statistically likely to drown in your own bathtub than your next door neighbour's. That doesn't suggest any intrinsic or causal flaw in Your Own Bathtub.

Most places online have issues with huge amounts of non-original video content, but I've also watched ton of ""Best of the Tenth Doctor"" or ""Best of Donna Noble"" on YouTube without them being taken down. BBC is usually pretty good at sorting between what is a leaked episode and a fan video.

One or both of them can adequately fill in for ashley cole when he leaves/retires. I also think mceachran is underrated, his struggles at boro were overblown and the entire team played awful during the 2nd half of the season. I really think mceachran can make the squad next year if we (hopefully) don't buy a central midfield.

For me lucas piazon is overrated. He is a good player don't get me wrong but behind hazard, oscar, moses and kdb who are very young in their own right I just don't see how he ever gets games here.

true,LostDigit,null,null,"I've seen a handful of despicable posts there, but it's hardly endemic. /r/unitedkingdom is far more ridiculous. I get this feeling here that there's a very real degree of...faux enlightenment. Any anti Islam comment here gets jumped and derided for racism, regardless of whether it's reasonable criticism or not. There's a wrong headed notion here that racism is saying anything negative about a group of people.

Sorry, but that's wrong. Racism is the unfair application of the crimes of the group onto the individual within it. It's not racist for example to say that ""blacks in the US commit most crimes."" It's not racist to say that blacks are more likely to commit crimes. These are statistical facts, and if facts trigger something in you which causes you to deride them instead of accepting and trying to do something about it, then it's time to wake up. What would be racist is saying, ""This person is black, therefore he's probably a criminal."" There's a great line between the two kinds of statements, and people here seem to miss it. You can't lay the crimes of the group at the feet of individuals in it, but you most definitely can criticise the group as a whole.

I tried earlier to point out the things I see wrong in Muslim culture that lead their religious fundamentalists to violence while Christian fundamentalists tend to merely make themselves look foolish. What did I get? Accusations that I think all Muslims are terrorists, that I implied as much while I stated the opposite. Hilariously, the WBC was thrown at me as an example of Christians being ""just as bad"" when they illustrate my point exactly.

This is what we get when our culture's fight against racism is primarily fought on children. Schools, television, educational materials all make the point that it's immoral and wrong and thus so are the people that do it. And that's fantastic and entirely entirely appropriate. If it's followed up on. But it's not. Like almost any lesson given to children, the message is too simple. We end up with adults whose perspective on racism is ""enlightened"", but intellectually equivalent to that of a childs'. That's what's choking /r/unitedkingdom now.

&gt;Ingrid Loyau-Kennett selflessly engaged the terrorists in conversation and kept her nerve as one of them told her: “We want to start a war in London tonight.”

&gt;Mrs Loyau-Kennett was a passenger on a number 53 bus which was travelling past the scene, and jumped off to check the soldier’s pulse.

&gt;“Being a cub leader I have my first aid so when I saw this guy on the floor I thought it was an accident then I saw the guy was dead and I could not feel any pulse.

&gt;“And then when I went up there was this black guy with **a revolver** and a kitchen knife, he had what looked like butcher’s tools and he had a little axe, to cut the bones, and two large knives and he said 'move off the body’.

&gt;“So I thought 'OK, I don’t know what is going on here’ and he was covered with blood. I thought I had better start talking to him before he starts attacking somebody else. I thought these people usually have a message so I said 'what do you want?’

&gt;“I asked him if he did it and he said yes and I said why? And he said because he has killed Muslim people in Muslim countries, he said he was a British soldier and I said really and he said 'I killed him because he killed Muslims and I am fed up with people killing Muslims in Afghanistan they have nothing to do there.”

“I started to talk to him and I started to notice more weapons and the guy behind him with more weapons as well. By then, people had started to gather around. So I thought OK, I should keep him talking to me before he noticed everything around him.

“He was not high, he was not on drugs, he was not an alcoholic or drunk, he was just distressed, upset. He was in full control of his decisions and ready to everything he wanted to do.

I said 'right now it is only you versus many people, you are going to lose, what would you like to do?’ and he said I would like to stay and fight.”

The suspect in the black hat then went to speak to someone else and Mrs Loyau-Kennett tried to engage with the other man in the light coat.

She said: “The other one was much shier and I went to him and I said 'well, what about you? Would you like to give me what you have in your hands?’ I did not want to say weapons but I thought it was better having them aimed on one person like me rather than everybody there, children were starting to leave school as well.

Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia
in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many
countries, improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods
of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the 
Prophet rule or live.  A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and 
refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity.  The fact that in Mohammedan 
law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as
a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the
faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.  


&gt;Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion 
paralyzes the social development of those who follow it.  No stronger retrograde
force exists in the world.  Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant 
and proselytizing faith.  It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising 
fearless warriors at every step, and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the 
strong arms of science, the science against which it (Islam) has vainly struggled, 
the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.”

""HELP ME!"" I yell to them.

Suddenly the van door opens and two cultural enrichment Islamic 'youths' from Somalia jump out screaming Allah Akbar and waving kitchen knives around.

The crowd gatherers around and says ""What should we do to help this person?""

Someone says ""I Know lets film this cultural enrichment!""

Suddenly everyone pulls out smart phones and begins filming and thanking the nice Somalia Islamic 'youths' for culturally enriching me.

I get stabbed 75 times and they try and cut my head off using the dull rusty butchers knife while everyone stands around filming and interviewing the nice Somali Islamic 'youths' asking them if there is any way we can help them feel more comfortable in New Sharia land.

""BBBBEEEP!"" a loud warning is blasted out of my homes indoors security monitoring camera informing me I have broken a Sharia law.

""Warning Citizen! You have not prayed to Allah fast enough!""

""Oh bullux"" I say outloud

""You will immediately traverse to the nearest Islamic government/Mosque center for cultural enrichment rehabilitation.""

I turn towards the government controlled security camera and thank them for making me more culturally diverse.

I walk out my front door after making a cup of tea and begin my journey towards cultural enrichment.

BBBBRRRRTTTTT! A van comes and smashes into me leveling me onto the ground and breaking my back.

""HELP!"" I yell to the crowd of MUM's and Chavs gathered around me.

""HELP ME!"" I yell to them.

Suddenly the van door opens and two cultural enrichment Islamic 'youths' from Somalia jump out screaming Allah Akbar and waving kitchen knives around.

The crowd gatherers around and says ""What should we do to help this person?""

Someone says ""I Know lets film this cultural enrichment!""

Suddenly everyone pulls out smart phones and begins filming and thanking the nice Somalia Islamic 'youths' for culturally enriching me.

I get stabbed 75 times and they try and cut my head off using the dull rusty butchers knife while everyone stands around filming and interviewing the nice Somali Islamic 'youths' asking them if there is any way we can help them feel more comfortable in New Sharia land.

ba dum tish.

we say autumn here.

I will find my previous comment about social life somewhere and bars. But in short. There is a rather overwhelming amount of choice. Nottingham is rather famous for its nightlife. 

Yay a different kind of question!

out door running you say? The university is attached to its own park with a lake. The main campus is on quite a hill if you want more of a challenge and its definitely big enough to run around.

Broxtowe park is another large park with woodland trails and hills. Its approx 2 miles from the uni west entrance.

Wollaton park is very near the unis northside and is mostly flat but very pretty, it has deer and a lake and a country house (Wayne manor in the lastest batmam film if you're interested)
CX races are often staged here on the hilly bit
The uni also has massive sports fields/meadows too.

There are other trails like the erewash valley trail which is very flat and goes along a canal. 

There is a footpath all the way along the trent from trent lock to the water sports place at holme pierpont. Thats a good 10 miles at least and goes through Attenborough nature reserve which is also good for a run round. 

If you're into fell running (eg certifably insane) you could get the train or drive to the nearby peak district and go run up some massive hills! 

Shipley park is a huge country park affair about 5-10 miles out of town into Derbyshire. Also nice gentle hills, woodland etc.

In short, you're not lacking in options

The mistake that these commenters are making is the assumption that, because Islamic terrorism is currently prominent, all Muslims are somehow involved in it. 

Many people have died in the name of every religion - Christianity (IRA, Breivik, KKK, the crusades), Judaism (Israel-Palestine conflict), Hinduism and Sikhism (India) and Islam (jihadi terrorism). 

The real issue is that there are just certain humans who are inclined to get far too overzealous and aggressive about something they believe in. It doesn't really matter what it is. I would be terrified to go near many of the non-religious libertarian gun nuts that inhabit Reddit. This doesn't really reflect on atheists as a whole. Neither does the KKK on Christians or terrorism on Muslims. 

Many people point to the contents of the Qur'an and claim that it advocates religious violence. If you go and do the same thing with the Bible, you'll find that there's an equal amount of unjustified advocacy of violence - dozens of instances of 'righteous' murder for completely absurd things, like wearing clothes of mixed fibres, making fun of someone's baldness or happening to live in a particular city. 

Really, it's all down to how people choose to interpret their religion. Most Christians and Muslims are nice, harmless people. Some - like today's attacker, or the Westboro Baptist Church - are batshit insane. 

Trying to pin the problem on a simple cause like 'Islam is evil' is just oversimplifying the problem. There are a raft of complex reasons for the current prominence of Islamic terrorism, like socioeconomic standing, disaffection with politics, anger against wars in the Middle East, racism and discrimination, poor integration between communities and copycatting.

If we actually made a concerted effort to address *these* problems, we might get somewhere. Telling impressionable youths that they are scum because their dearest-held belief is inherently evil?

Good places to run are abundant. Wollaton Park is just across the road from the North end of campus and has lots of trails (plus the sprawling manor used as Bruce Wayne's house in the most recent Batman film). Running around campus is also pretty nice, the downs especially.

Bars are not so popular in Nottingham as are clubs. Clubs will sponsor student nights out so look out for those. Market Bar, Ocean, and Bopp are some of my personal favorites. If you're more in to bars though there is Blue Bell and also Baa Bar. Also, many of the halls on the University Park campus have their own bars/eateries, kind of pubs, and there's a campus tradition of getting a pint or drink at all of them in one night which is called doing a ""Campus 14"" as there are 14 bars.

Quirky cultural things about Nottingham? Off the top of my head the best I can think of is that they call a bread roll a 'cob'. I'm sure there are loads more but I couldn't really tell you, sorry!

[MayFest](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mayfest/) is supposed to be a pretty good festival put on by the uni every year and there's also an end-of-the-year summer festival on the Downs if I recall correctly. Student societies will also put on formal galas at the end of each year. 

In general, there's lots to do in and around Nottingham. Plenty of beautiful nature less than a day away, lots of cool shops in the city center, and loads going on on campus.

Simply put, I am British but currently live in Germany. I cannot do anything official without being forced to prove who I am and as a foreigner that means showing my passport and my registration certificate. All German adults have an ID card. This is fairly common across Europe. You can't run a business without going to the tax office and showing your ID to register it.

It sounds onerous and bureaucratic but it does make it a lot more difficult for illegal immigrants to survive. Personally I thought that the UK idea for an ID card was a good one, it had just been overloaded with functions so as to make it a nightmare to implement.

I think there is also a cycle track (currently out of action due to tram work) that goes under the ring road more towards Ruddington. 

My advice for locking up in town is to use either Bunny's bikes on Carrington St or Freewheel on Goosegate both bike shops offer cycle parking at a small fee (something like £3). If you buy a silly fancy looking bike like a fixy or a ridiculous mountain bike covered in features and cheap lock it's going to get stolen (pretty much anywhere in the world). I'd suggest a good D lock AND a wire lock or chain. Use them both. Few cycle thieves can be bothered with 2 locks or carry tools for two types of lock. That's not to say they never do but it'll help. Plus if your bike looks shitty (even if it isn't) it'll be fine. Never leave it out in the city (or anywhere else for that matter) over night. 

There is a good cycle lock-up next to the Station Street entrance to Nottingham Station. Although when it was first put in the media delighted in the fact that a bike was stolen from there, it's actually pretty good, has CCTV and a high number of station staff and a big council building looking over it.

&gt;The issue is that it is hard to identify who is who in the UK system. In most of Europe you have to show your ID card or a passport. That the system was abused is certain although nobody knows how much and there were also sham marriages.

It's not hard to identify who is in the UK system. They have UK based entry clearances or leaves to remain. Spouses of EEA nationals are issued a totally different ID card. Nowadays, everyone is issued a BRP (biometric residency permit). When do you think people do not need to show their right to live here when they should?

And I am not saying there aren't sham marriages. If you read the article, it concerns EEA nationals which is a totally different system, and, as I've posted before, is the more logical system to exploit for sham marriages (free, less oversight, onus on the country/EU to prove that the marriage is a sham, etc). There is nothing in the changes of 2012 which make the UK based path less abusable.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"Background:

As a brown Muslim one thing I found funny was how many people thought the attacker(s) was Asian as soon as the suspect was identified as Muslim. The amount of 'deport/wipe out all the Pakis' comments on twitter, facebook etc. was ridiculous and then when it turned out they were black, they merely seemed to extend their position to include 'all Muslims', 'foreigners' and 'immigrants' rather than taking a more nuanced position. 

What we do know is two black/British Muslims targeted and killed a British soldier in a revenge attack for the Iraq war. This is clear from the videos circulated of the attacker explaining why he felt 'he had to do it' in front of others and even apologising for beheading him in public. This is what I'd call a politically motivated murder/assassination. Not sure whether it falls under the category of terrorism because that tends to be killing loads of random people (e.g. 7/7) whereas this was a targeted attack. It's similar to attacks on troops/police in NI, I wouldn't class that as terrorism, although in Woolwich the soldier/victim wasn't in uniform. 

Unsurprisingly in addition to the aforementioned wave of racist and anti-immigrant sentiment in reaction to this attack there was a keenness to blame multiculturalism for this crime. This seems to be the go-to argument now whenever a person of non-native descent or foreign attributes commits a crime. Sarcastic comments of 'cultural enrichment' and 'how great diversity is' flood pages of reddit especially /r/worldnews and /r/europe. European governments [are blamed for taking too soft an approach with immigrants](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1euj25/video_of_man_who_killed_soldier_with_machete_in/ca411ee?context=4) despite this attack not being carried out by immigrants thus being irrelevant. Interestingly we didn't see this response from Americans after the Boston bombing despite them being immigrants - I think this is probably because the average American is far more likely to identify as having a foreign background (Irish, Mexican, African etc.) than the average Brit.

**Diagnosis:**

1. It's nothing to do with lack of integration, that black guy spoke perfectly good English, he had perfectly good social skills and was able to converse freely with other British people without need of assistance. If this sort of attack was caused by lack of integration we'd have Bangladeshi housewives beheading people on a daily basis because few can speak English or have English friends (I'm speaking as a Bengali here). All terrorist attacks I know of in the UK have been carried out by well integrated people who were born/raised in the UK.

2. It was a politically motivated attack carried out by a Muslim, crucially the motive was identical to the motive behind 7/7, Madrid and Boston - the Iraq war. All perpetrators of those three attacks explicitly cited the Iraq war as justification for their attacks and all attacks were carried out by Muslims living thousands of miles away from each other in different countries with very different ethnic backgrounds: Asian, West Indian, Chechen, Moroccan etc.

3. This is a global problem, not a domestic one. Trying to frame this as a domestic/British issue isn't useful because it's nothing to do with their 'British upbringing' otherwise it'd only be Britain where this happens. 

4. A political problem requires a political solution, not a social/cultural one. It's a reactionary political problem which motivates some Muslims to carry out such attacks. Similar to Catholics and the IRA, the attacks were in response to perceived British oppression of Catholics in Ireland, this problem although still exists was largely resolved via a political solution, this is the most effective way of dealing with a political problem. If the government tried talking about the Pope, Vatican, Catholicism, bible etc. or said it was because of culture/lack of integration it wouldn't have got very far. The political problem here is that many Muslims perceive that given the lack of WMDs the Iraq war was essentially the unwarranted massacre of Muslims and this has sparked several retaliatory attacks by small terrorist cells. If politicians can actually face up to this and better justify the war and explain that they weren't targeting Muslims but trying to do something good then it may go some way to resolve this dispute.

5. It's not the responsibility of the Muslim community, the black community, the Woolwich community, the male community etc. to prevent these things from happening - it's the responsibility of law enforcement. I don't know why this seems to happen every time a minority commits a crime, when a white man commits a crime you never see the same argument put forward - because it's a stupid one.",0,1369295346,null,0,1369295536,1,ca4ca82,t3_1evyoj,t1_ca4ca82,t3_1evyoj,null,1431061842,68,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,68

Chelsea is a hundred million dollar enterprise, Malouda has to retire and look after his family with what he has, which always isn't as much as one would think for a thirty year retirement, he made what he thought was the right economic decision for him, just as the club made what they thought was the right one for them.

It's always about loyalty to the club, but really, people only mean that when you're of value to the club. When your play is no longer what they want then it becomes about how selfish you are for not treating the club like a family member as it dumps you.

That offer was unsatisfactory to him. He therefore refused. Chelsea refused by sending him to the U21 possibly, as he speculated, to pressure him into leaving.

When the relationship has deteriorated that badly what can change? If only one team wanted him how many are willing to take him out on loan and pick up the tab? Is he supposed to play his way back into the team, from the reserves? At 30? At a club that wanted him gone? There is no solution, he leaves in a year. End of.

So if he wants to play he'd have to leave the reserves and Chelsea. And there we run into the whole motives thing. Maybe he wanted the money for his family, maybe not, maybe it was for his retirement, maybe not. Pick the one you want.

Now, his deterioration is not the fault of the club in this case so that might factor, but otherwise really, he had the contract. It's HIS money.Chelsea should have never given it to him and then tried to dump him (apparently he had a fallout with RDM).

If you were to try to do that without prior entry clearance, you'd need to show to satisfy the IO that you were going to leave and had no plans to settle. This isn't something you can dismiss as ""so on"". If you were caught being deceptive, your wife would be risking a ban. In the very least, she'd be risking a bounce which does happen every single day, even to genuine visitors who are married to British citizens. *edit: and this is assuming your wife is not from a country where prior entry clearance is required and no border issued visitor visas are given*

As for the rest of your absconding scenario, it has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about here. I don't think anyone's advocating no oversight to the immigration system, and there was plenty of oversight before 2012. The scenario you describe could happen under the current system. If anything, the fact that couples have a longer temporary period before settling only increases that risk.

And this:

&gt;You see if you stay together, should your partner be a burden upon the system, you are obliged to provide support. 

isn't the case. It's the case in some countries, but it's not here. Under the old system, those who were issued benefits either in error or out of humanitarian grounds could apply for a longer term limited leave to remain (called discretionary leave). It was, however, grounds for refusal, so it was a gamble (and they did check when the person applied for ILR). Now, if they fail the tests (whether they claim benefits or not) they are required to complete an even longer term before they have permanent residency.

* There's actually a decent pub near where you'll live called **The Johnson Arms.** Been in a few times; varied selection of drinks and some decent pub grub.
* As u/formerwomble mentioned, there are plenty of running options. If you're really dedicated however, you can join the running club, part of the student's union athletic union.
* During the first week (Week One,) there will be a ton of activities available to post grads. I strongly recommend you join in, and you'll be able to find the best pubs/clubs yourself.
* Most of the festivals happen in the summer. **Download** is situated about 1hr from Nottingham, if you're interested.
* In February, the Varsity series begins. American Football usually kicks it off, but the biggest event is Ice Hockey.

Or that, ""Group A fosters prickishness compared to other groups""

I agree. But to me, that sounds very different to criticising the group as a whole. When you simply criticise a group, you're criticising everyone in it, in a lot of people's eyes, including my own. The example above is highlighting an issue that occurs within that group, without tarnishing everyone in it. Well actually in the 2nd example not so much, that sounds like group A approves of and harbours these views, but maybe just a poor example. When people simply criticise black culture and community, that to me is including every black person. When people comment that there are issues within the black community and culture, and criticise those behind the specific issue, then I have no issues with it.

When people say the black community has issues to face, fair enough. When people say black culture is to blame, I get the hump, and I think that's divisive.

&gt;""blacks in the US commit most crimes."" It's not racist to say that blacks are more likely to commit crimes.

You're making the most basic fallacy of statistics there is, by taking a statistical correlation and stating it in such a way as to imply a statistical causation.

Let's say for argument's sake (I don't know if it is true or not), that in the US, if you look at all the crimes committed, a greater percentage of *convicted offenders* are black, compared to any other single racial group.

The statistically accurate way of stating this is to say, ""When a crime has been committed, it is statistically more likely that the offender *who will eventually become convicted*, is a black person.""

From this alone, it is not possible to form a statistic about how likely it is for any one black person to actually commit a crime, or how likely it is for any one black person to have committed any particular crime under investigation.

Also, statistics won't tell you if there is a causal relationship between the two. It only shows that there is some sort of correlation between being black, and being convicted for a crime. There are hundreds of other possible explanations for this correlation other than, ""black people are more likely to commit crimes."" One possible explanation is ""black people are more likely to get *convicted* for committing a crime"".

When you are unable to find an actual causal relationship between being black and being a criminal, it then becomes unfair to associate being black with being a criminal. Since a black person can't help being black, it is then racist to suggest that his ethnicity has anything at all to do with being a criminal.

When people here complain about racist posts, what they're saying is that it is racist to create a link between an atrocity and the ethnicity of the person who committed it.

When a black guy commits a crime, it's not because he's black, it's because he's a criminal. His ethnicity should have *nothing* to do with it. And any statistics quoted implying a link between the two, no matter how *statistically accurate* is misleading.

In a similar fashion, when some crazy Islamic fundamentalist commits a crime, it's not because he's Islamic, it's because he's fucking nuts!

When the Crusades killed tens of thousands of people, was that because the religion was evil, or those particular people were evil? When the Japanese invaded Nanjing and murdered 300,000 people, was that because the Japanese are evil, or those soldiers were evil? Godwin's law coming up: when the Germans killed 6 million Jews under a technically Catholic leader, was it because Germans or Catholics are evil, or the Nazis were evil?

To use statistics to draw a link between Islam and terrorist attacks, while *statistically accurate*, is confusing correlation with causation and is wrong and misleading.

We saw is with the IRA.  Not every catholic in Northern Ireland or Ireland was a member of the IRA. However without the groundswell of popular support, the IRA could not have existed.  They received a lot of soft support that took the form of of such things as donations, alibis, safe houses or people turning a blind eye.

We see *exactly* the same thing today amongst Muslims.  A large percentage of Muslims don't support any form of violence.  However a large percentage do.  And similar to the soft support the IRA received, Muslims do the same in the support of their 'brothers'.  Charitable donations.  Help with an airfare.  Online comments supporting the struggle.  Youtube lectures denouncing decadent western lifestyle.  Turning a blind eye.  The list is substantial.

If you are going to say ""but they want the west to be Islamic"" well firstly the Quran says conversion can not be an act of compulsion and while a lot of people like to say the Islamic empire spread it by the sword the empire was actually largely religiously tolerant. None muslims were expected to pay a tax and frankly the fact that a small tribe from the back end of nowhere was able to form one of the largest empires in history in around 100 years is a strong argument that they had a god on their side.

The call for this by terrorist is little more than a recruiting tool to try and stir up and capture the minds of disaffected youths to use in what is largely a politically motivated move to get the west to withdraw from given regions so that these people can more fully control it. The west offers a freedom that is toxic to how they retain power and control so they largely wish to paint a picture in which the west must submit to Islam, something they know it will never do, because it gives them a never ending them vs us narrative. Which is a narrative that runs largely counter to their own history but again that history has been wrapped by these people to suit their ends.

Terrorism occurs for political reasons. Those who support the Islamic variety generally argue the UK is attacking the Muslim world, and it's fair to attack the UK in retaliation.

Blair and his cabinet, every pro-war MP, and every soldier who invaded, should be tried, convicted and punished harshly, and the UK should pay compensation, apologize and stop all attacks on Muslim nations. Furthermore, the UK should stop supporting Arab dictatorships, and isolate and punish Israel for its apartheid and denial of a state and a right of return to the Palestinian people.

We shouldn't do this *because* we want to reduce terrorism, simply because these are the right things to do.

However, if we did this, claims the UK was attacking the Muslim world would clearly have no basis, and terrorists would lose support. It's true that some individuals might still seek to attack the country for its past misdeeds, but if the UK showed contrition and stopped its aggression, the UK would over time stop being seen as a bad guy.

*In your opinion*, which you're entitled to, just like I'm entitled to mine.  But since you're not responsible for this subreddit, the moderators are perfectly at liberty to either heed your advice or ignore it.  This is a subreddit set up by people who give up their time for free, based on something they decided to do, and they are in no way answerable or beholden to what you want.

Personally I don't see a need for more moderation, and wouldn't want to see endless comments every time a moderator does something - judging by the amount of moderation they get through it would piss all over the subreddit.

The best moderators are the ones that are least seen.  The ones that are quietly effective without disturbing the natural order of things.

Not those that spend their time justifying and explaining everything they do, which just becomes a distraction.

&gt; Promote some more mods and fulfil the clear desire for justified moderation.

What *clear desire*?  At the time of writing, your 15 hour old comment asking for all these moderation changes is on 4 points, and my 9 hour old comment decrying it is on 5 points.

Being a part of the community was rewarded by inclusion. Not sure how to express what I mean by that, sorry.

If there isn't integration it's always blamed on the ethnic/religious community in question BUT local councils at the very same time are encouraging this behaviour with their policies and what I think is basically state racism, positive or not. So what does this matter? Yes the idiots yesterday were Londoners but the environment and beliefs they signed up to were the RESULT of state multiculturalism allowing extremists to be treated differently to, for example, the Westboro Baptist church who are banned from this country.  Equality laws educated the public and reduced racism. State multiculturalism has had a negative impact imo as it's reduced the incentive to fit in. Sorry, I just feel like that. Multiculturalism happens anyway, in a more positive fashion, when it's allowed to evolve by itself. I'm Sikh and I've notice a massive, and I mean MASSIVE shift towards more strict adherence and separation from the mainstream specifically by baptised Sikhs with almost a round of applause from councils and the media in general (who the fuck are the Sikh Council? I never voted for them). I resent being lumped in with them by the media as there are lots of different strands of Sikhism, such as mine that dropped baptism. That's probably colouring my perception of multiculturalism quite a lot tbh.

A terrorist incident doesn't have to be a bomb or plane into a building, it's when the intent is to terrorise more than just the victim, when the incident is intended to put fear into the nation and spread a message. This is different to a gang murder which is done out of spite or or revenge..

Even without government approval, which was there, a navy seal team could have gone in and done what they did in Pakistan without sovereign authorisation. 

You must understand that governments are derived to some degree from the people. If an overwhelming majority in Afghanistan were against the Taliban government, they would have otherthrown it. We saw this same tipping point being reached in Algeria, Libya and Egypt.

The reason why the Taliban are so archaic is because the people of Afghanistan are in general, archaic. We cannot change that. You might think that we have been successful in that, but I have to ask you, what are your parameters for that?

When opium growing has trebled since the fall of the Taliban, child prostitution and molestation by newly installed government officials rife and well document, violence and deaths at an all time high, and now topping the World's corruption leaderboards, how are we by any means successful? We have a nation that is a worse quagmire than Vietnam for the West. The day after Western forces leave the Taliban would be able to seize power, and because of our actions, they would be miles more radical than they were 2001.

If you think losing thousands of lives, and killing hundreds of thousands more, and leaving a country that as soon as we pull out will be even worse than when we left it is successful, hell I'd love to see unsuccessful.

That can't be right. And for the person with no job or working part time, where's the incentive to get a job or take on more hours if it means they lose the benefits which enable them to live where they do? And when you've got the state guarnteeing the rent of claimants, where is the pressure on landlords to make their rent more reasonable.

I don't think there should be a stigma attached to claiming benefits as I fully intend on using them if I ever need to. I just think that they should be done fairly for everyone.

Regarding your last point, a friend of mine had to live on his sister's couch and then at a friend's house when he was out of work and trying to complete a master's course so that he could get a better job.

Because it's been proven time and again that people who have an axe to grind often take the opportunity to do so if offered, whereas individuals happy with the status quo are generally pretty ambivalent and don't make an effort to point out that they're satisfied.

I do take your point seriously, and i think you are right, i realise that my title will not successful in garnering a respectable debate between differing opinions. And trying my best to be introspective here, for all intents and purposes i don't think i wanted a debate with her. i have no desire to enter into a debate with the writer of this piece, i would just get drowned out by a sea of (in my opinion) bollocks and as i mentioned in another one of my comments; immediately after these events is not the best time to have an informed, calm and collected discussion. (that goes for me as well).

still i genuinely believe that what she wrote is dangerous and shouldn't be spread, i think that it is a small ball of evil wrapped up in niceties, which means that a lot of people take it in and spread it on without noticing the evil, and that's why i wrongly or rightly submitted this post.

as for my personal opinions, i whole heartidly agree with the PM's comments

&gt; the attacks, were ""solely and purely"" the responsibility of the individuals involved.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roshonara_Choudhry

&gt; Roshonara Choudhry (Bengali: রুশনারা চৌধুরী; born 1989) is a British student who stabbed British MP Stephen Timms on 14 May 2010 during his constituency surgery in an attempt to kill him.

&gt; She said her attack was to **punish Timms for voting for the Iraq War**, and revenge for the Iraqi people.[12][13]

&gt; The Revolution Muslim website described Choudhry as a heroine... ""We ask Allah for her action to inspire Muslims to **raise the knife of Jihad against those who voted for the countless rapes, ­murders, pillages, and torture of Muslim civilians** as a direct ­consequence of their vote.""

I don't have any argument with the validity of your comment.  All opinions are valid, in the sense that they are entitled to be held and (providing an individual isn't lying) is an accurate reflection of how they see things from their perspective.

My only real beef with your argument (other than holding a different view of what constitutes good moderation, which I think we've pretty much accepted we disagree on) was the bit about there being a clear desire for justified moderation.  I don't feel there is enough evidence either way to confirm this.

I actually don't disagree with you in some regards.  There are plenty of occasions in which people should be visibly accountable for their actions.  It is a sound ideal in many cases.  Politicians and individuals in positions funded by the taxpayer, for example, could do with taking your advice.  It's a disgrace that so much of the work carried out by the people who are supposed to be in our service is obscured and deliberately withheld from us.

His long ball delivery is spot on, his ability to crack a shot from 30 yards out is unequaled on this team, and his aggressiveness in diving in and challenging attackers is less risky in this role, so I love seeing him running around like that Playstation player he was derided for earlier in his career at CFC.

true,Lord_Yaxley,scot-scottishborders,Jings Crivvens Help Ma Boab,"&gt;Well duh. It's pretty obvious there's going to be violence in many parts of the world at all times and much of it will masquerade as religious violence. I don't think it's possible to have a religion like Islam which is followed almost a quarter of the world population without it being an integral part of some kind of conflict in some place in the world. There's plenty of nutty Christian leaders in sub-saharan Africa for comparison. That's not the point at all.

I disagree, it is very much the point.  There are other global religions with greater amounts of followers.  And there is no such level of conflict being waged to the same scale in their name.  Conflict in Africa is resource based, not ideologically based, so cherry picking one or two such cases and balancing it against the overwhelming scale of Islamic war is asinine.  We have to face the fact that this particular belief system has a problem.  

&gt;The point is there was no Islamic Extremist in Britain before the last decade. Go ahead, name me literally a single incident of Islamic violence which occurred in the UK before Britain entered the Iraq war.

Just because a terrorist plot was foiled it doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken into account.  Foiled Islamic terror plots in the UK pre-2004 include:

2000:  Moinul Abedin

2001: Richard Colvin Reid (The shoe bomber)

2003:  Wood Green ricin plot

2003:  Andrew Rowe

2004: Seven men arrested in West Sussex in possession of 600 kg of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, as part of Operation Crevice.

2004: Fourteen men arrested, but only eight charged in relation to the 2004 Financial buildings plot following the leak of the identity of an Al-Qaeda double-agent

2004: Four men arrested in the Holiday Inn in Brent Cross trying to buy red mercury

However I again state that many of these terrorists do not view country borders in the same way you or I do.  We have to take a combined and coordinated approach with our allies to deal with their threat, because it is not simply going to go away.

It is not economically motivated, because it happens in affluent situations, it is not racially motivated, because Islam is not a race or race specific, and it is not because local populations are particularly intolerant of immigrants, otherwise we would see similar tensions between other migrants such as Chinese or Poles.

It is an ideology, or belief system that people learn and chose to follow.  And it has problems within its ranks.",0,1369315182,null,0,1369318551,0,ca4f9si,t3_1euta3,t1_ca4f9si,t1_ca4dz9s,null,1431060434,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

His strengths lie at CB and his consistency this year has proved that. Sure, it's extremely useful for him to have the quality to play in a DM role and he certainly does have it - but only against weaker opposition. When he's played at DM against stronger opponents, like Tottenham, like Benfica, his vunerablities have been shown. Too often he was guilty of not tracking back quick enough and letting players run past him.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"We haven't conceded an insane amount of goals, only 3 more in the league than last season. The problem has been in the big games, we conceded 2 goals in every single game against the top 5 (except Chelsea away). Clearly the better players know they can punish our vulnerabilities, but also we seem to shoot ourselves in the foot more often than not. I'm looking forward to seeing less of this happening, but I am a little concerned that we'll miss the experience of Carra, and the signings (other than Toure, who won't be first choice) are young and relatively inexperienced. 

We seem to be incredibly weak at set pieces (conceding from them against Spurs twice, Chelsea twice, when we had control of those games), it doesn't help that our best defender Agger has struggled in this regard. Despite not hearing much from Rodgers about it I hope the team works on this over the summer. Perhaps after a full season the defence will be able to cut out these mistakes as they are more accustomed to being in the situations that our attack-mindedness leaves us in.

I think Enrique needs some competition because he can play so well, look like one of the best left backs in the league over 5/6 games and then lose form and concentration. Similarly, but less obviously, Johnson's form dipped since February. Kelly coming back to fitness will keep him on his toes.

I lived in an area known as Putteridge, nice quiet area with decent people and decent schools too. There are many others, Bushmead is quite nice with good Primary Schools, Wigmore, Copthorne are also nice I could go on.

Seeing uniformed personnel walking about is a very common non-event (just the usual friendly nods of one member of the community to another). I've never heard of issues because of a member of the forces walking around in their uniform (Luton aside). 

Frankly you're just another guy going about your daily business wearing their work clothes. Granted, the uniform represents something more significant than my suit and tie but when the appearance of uniforms is so ingrained in an area it becomes part of daily life anyway.

Yes, it was a serving soldier that was attacked outside an Army Barracks.  I would posit that this is probably the most likely place in the UK to find a soldier if that is what you want to do.  
They then committed murder, and asked people to film them so that they could rant about the travesties committed by the British Army in other countries.  

Have I about summed it up?  

My problem with your analysis is that you automatically prescribe them the title of ""terrorist"".  By this logic, any murder can become a terrorist attack as long as the attacker attaches some measure of political ideals to it, hopefully in full public view.  

If a Saudi/Uruguayan-born person attacks a homosexual in Crewe, and then is captured talking about how this is how this kind of person is treated in their country; how they ""wouldn't be allowed in their country""; and how the UK should change its way regarding the equality of sexualities, is this a terrorist attack against our principles of egalitarianism?  Or is it just a sick fuck who should probably feel the sharp end of a pointy thing themselves?  

I can understand labelling some attacks as 'terrorism', as they attempt to injure the psyche of a nation as a whole, either by targeting areas of mass transit or of mass communion.  The people who orchestrate these *at least* have some idealised aims and attempt to use their contravention of all normal human morality to get people to think/talk about their issue.  

These guys have done nothing more than commit a murder and then say a bunch of phrases that we have all heard before a hundred times.  They have not furthered any political ideals for any group in any way.  
So I personally don't believe that we should label it as such and elevate what is a rather stupid and senseless crime into something that has some meaning.  It doesn't.  They are stupid and will hopefully die in prison with everyone having forgot about them.

He makes angle decisions that just baffle me sometimes - an example being our last game against United.  I think Luiz was in the pressure role facing RVP just outside the 6.  Luiz tried to anticipate a move to the *outside* (acute angle) and completely gave away the path to the *inside* (obtuse angle). The United player didn't even put a feint on him - he just seemed to have some premonition that the play was going that way and stepped out.  RVP promptly took a touch inside and cracked off a shot.  Luckily, Cahill or one of our other defenders in the cover role was able to make the block.  Just little things like that annoy me.  I realize that many players have a much stronger foot and you should anticipate them moving to that side (i.e. Bale).  But not RVP and not just outside the 6.

Here's a second dimension for you:


Extremist Muslim, complete twatend: I am Muslim, I believe in Allah, this book is his word, and right here it says I have a right to lie to none-believers, and kill them.



Moderate Muslim, nice person: No, no, no Islam is about peace and love, but Allah *is* god, and this *is* the book he wrote, and here is another verse that says be nice to people.



None-religious, nice person: I don't believe that is the word of any god, it is no justification for killing anyone.




As an extremist, they essentially see the moderate as just having a difference of opinion, and a wrong one if the verse they're basing their actions off is quite explicit and plain, WHICH THEY OFTEN ARE. They even go as far as validating their belief that their god exists, and the book that inspired them to kill is the word of their god.


I know this from being raised in a fundamentalist cult, albeit non-violent. Moderate Christians were just wrong and bending and twisting explicit instructions. It was obvious, and due to the time period the Bible was written in, it was obvious I was right, and the moderates were bending it to fit in with modern societies norms and since evolved culture.



It took the non-religious to make me rethink my views. The moderates, who superficially seemed like everyday people, the same as those attacking my beliefs, due to agreeing with me fundamentally, only reinforced my beliefs.



Like it or not, moderate Muslims do lend credence to and indirectly prop up the extremists.


That's not to say moderates aren't nice people, they are, but NOT because of their religion but because of the society they've adopted or grown up in. One that has evolved completely independently of religion that tends to be conservative. The only way around this would be to modify the holy books to rip out all the shite, which a child could quite easily do, or just wait till the rest of the worlds societies catch up.

Many thanks for your email to customer services regarding the issues you experienced at our [REDACTED] Halfords store. I was sorry to read the comments you make and totally understand the disappointment and frustration this matter would cause you.

I have passed your details to the Store Manager, [REDACTED] who has assured me that he is investigating this matter internally and will update me when he has further information. I have ascertained that the car you mention did not belong to one of our employees but was picking our employee up after his shift. Nonetheless we agree totally that whilst employees are wearing our uniform they are still representing the company, and you have my assurance that if what you allege did take place, appropriate disciplinary action will definitely be taken.

Please be assured that this matter is being thoroughly investigated and I would like to pass on my own apologies for your experience. I would be grateful if you would provide a contact number to pass to [REDACTED] so he may contact you further.

I'm not long back after being away for years, and what I'm doing is moving east (Essex, Chelmsford) and commuting in on motorbike. My commutes an hour right to St. Pauls.


Really cannot recommend a motorbike enough, it's so much cheaper than the tube or driving. Expect £200 a year insurance, £1200 to buy a 125cc bike (I'm still a learner), and I spend about £8 every 3 days on fuel. Parking is free, no congestion charge, and you zip through traffic. The downer is when bad weather hits, which means all winter you'll need winter gear.


Rent in that part of the world is around £850 a month for a 3 bedroom house with a decent garden, Chelmsford is a nice place, low crime, lots of shops etc. You can also go for one of the towns nearby with similar prices, buying is also cheap.


Beer is between £2.5-4 a pint depending on the pub, I save by home brewing (in the garden shed), brings it down to about 50p a pint (after my mistakes). I believe a Sunday dinner will set you back between £8-10 but wouldn't know as I cook at home all the time to save money(if you do this, even with healthy frozen meals you'll save a packet).


Essex is a nice place in general to live, it's growing and most of it is pretty English (the exception is Barking, which is mostly Nigerian and Polish, Polish is OK, the Nigerians not so much). Good schools, nice countryside a stones throw away, seaside is 20 mins from most places.


To top it off you can work in central London, so loads of jobs with great pay.


Something you'll need to look out for though is credit history, it's difficult to rent from an agency (most places up on websites are this) unless you've got good credit history, full time employment (not self employed), and proof of income over x amount (that amount being 2.5x the annual rent) for the last 2 years. If you can't provide this documentation then you need to provide 6 months rent up front + deposit (so essentially 7 months rent) or find a private land lord which is more difficult.

true,HasturCarcosa,null,null,"River said the doctor's name to stop the GI from killing his companions. She knew that he would never be able to say his own name, and so she did it for him, thus sparing the life of his friends and himself.

Eh, timey wimey really. The GI's main goal was to kill the Doctor, rewrite all his victories into losses. Clara's goal was the opposite, stop the GI. She ended up, I think, with the Doctor's help, reaching that end point where all the culminations of the Doctor existed, and then he went there and rescued her.

He was there in the beginning, he was sporadic in his appearances I will admit, but not everything revolved around him. It's just how Doctor Who, Moffat gives a taste, then moves onto the next flavour, but you always keep thinking ""OH! THIS IS THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST EPI-nope oh this isn't him at all."" Sidenote: The GI was Yog-Sothoth from the Lovecraft universe, early incarnations of the Doctor fought the GI once, he has also fought, to my dismay, Hastur (Named Fenris)

They were not, they weren't really Paramilitary they were the Church of England basically, who had gone back to the ways of Knights and Templars, but with guns. What happened to them you ask? They exist, River was pardoned for her crime and I assume as a lot of churches and military organizations go they just kept existing.

I will admit, the Doctor would have been somewhat safe had he never gone to Trenzalore (He would have been hunted for eternity though) but we know one thing from the episode though: the Doctor goes to Trenzalore eventually. In his time stream, in the end of all things, The Doctor goes to Trenzalore. With the GI being immortal and patient, he could have waited till that day that the Doctor goes to Trenzalore and done all this. The doctor sped it all up though. This was basically a reaffirmation that if you read something then it becomes a fixed point (All those graves there? The Doctor didn't want to start reading graves and figure out who died with him, nor did he really want to find out what happened to him in the end.)

Did you watch the first part of the episode when they had the Psychic Dream meeting? That's pretty much your answer really. At that point in time, Clara and River had been in touch through their minds, which can transcend time as we're told by the Silurian (Forget her damn name but not important) when they broke the meeting up, River stayed locked with Clara to have a conduit through time and space to both her (And subsequently to the Doctor, who manipulated the link because he's the better psychic)

It is a conscious link, and with the mind being such a tricky thing, it wouldn't be hard to believe that she (or he) could make it seem physical. Input is sensory, and if he believes he's touching her, then he could probably touch her. It's not outside the realm of possibilities that the Doctor (being the better psychic) allowed her to manifest by his perception in some meaningful way.

I'm only 4 years out of graduation but I see new grad CVs quite a lot for our paid internships and junior researcher hires - and I've had to hire my replacement at my first job. I would have chucked that in the bin I'm afraid.

I'm also assuming you are aiming for an office or graduate position, rather than say a kitchen pos.

Your re-write is much, much better. In fact the formatting/layout is almost identical to mine (except I now flipped education to the end - but that's a personal thing. As a newish grad you want to keep your education up top.

Here's what I would suggest:

1) Go ahead and cut down your university to  2 or 3 bullet points. It really shouldn't take up the majority of the page. 


2) One of those should be your dissertation title, and if it was good, the grade.


3) Knock off the part which says 'holidays' - anyone reading your CV will know that. 


4) Reduce down your 2 sentence bullet points to one sentence.


• Working in a busy pub has enabled me to develop an excellent ability to work under 
pressure. I regularly processed over 250 orders at peak times, working quickly and accurately

becomes

* Processed over 250 orders at peak times to high standards

or

* Proven ability to process X volumes of orders to high standards during periods of intense activity

Similarly:

• A proven ability to react in areas that require immediate attention and ensuring that orders are heard clearly by the rest of the Kitchen team and the chefs get the 
correct food for each order.

becomes

* Ensured organisation of order queue resulting in lowest wastage for X years

And:

• Assisting chefs and other catering staff with the preparation of hot and cold foods whilst following and implementing all health and safety regulations, with additional responsibilities for sending out all starters.

becomes:

* Assisted catering staff with food production to kitchen standards


Second bullet point


* Promoted to position of responsibility with oversight of all starters


I would say the key is to be concise and precise.

You did X which achieved Y.


It's a running theme (no pun intended) throughout your CV.

So for example your running club, you should be more concise. Less waffle. 

Formulated an awards scheme for improvements in race times, giving members an added incentive to improve their performances, demonstrating my ability motivate  individuals.

Could be:

Strong leadership saw me implement incentives for performance, successfully motivating the team to win X races

Recruited an additional twenty members by targeting students, who lacked an on  campus running society, by increasing club recruitment material available on 
 campus, such as in the Student Union and Gym

Could be:

- Applied marketing and sales techniques to double size (or increase by X% - everyone likes a % increase) of team in 2010/11 year.

IT  Literate in both Mac and Windows operating systems, with particular proficiency in  their respective word and presentation programmes.

Could be:

- Proficient with all common office programs



Overall, your CV isn't that bad -and take my suggestions with a healthy pinch of salt. I'm not really re-reading myself and I really should be doing other things. 

I would also like to say your travelling section is rather unique. I've never seen anyone do something like that before and it's really quite clever.


TL;DR: Less words, say more.

He needed that introduction of John Hurt to make sure that people knew what he meant. And to be honest if you're looking into every little detail and trying to point out plot holes you're gonna have a bad time (which you are apparently). In Doctor Who there are a lot of things that are explained in the future and something that never are. It's kinda what makes it a great a show, it leaves things to your imagination and Moffat kinda does that to show how big the Who universe is. But I'll try to explain some of your points:
1. The Doctor said before he went in to save Clara that she had an advantage over the GI. (him) so my thoughts is that before Clara died like the GI the doctor was able to save her. I'm assuming the GI was killed inside that pit in the doctor's time stream and the doctor got there before it killed Clara. And why would the doctor spread by going into his own time stream? He is the doctor. 
2. River always appears out of order so it makes sense we haven't seen hologram her before. And the doctor is the bad ass who can kiss anyone. 
3. I agree a little with the GI thing about it kinda just happening and the whole he can never go to trenzalore thing being peachy but keep in mind the episode isn't really over. They're gonna explain a lot more in the 50th anniversary episode.

true,Kevthehuman,tennant,Tennant,"Aaaand here we go!

Firstly, I didn't mind the opening bit as much, because it introduces plot previously unknown to us, with Clara interacting with the other Doctors and declaring that she was ""Born to save The Doctor"". You're just like, What? Where is this coming from? So, to me at least, it's a nice little prologue-y bit before the tardis WARRRBL and the opening sequence.

Next, The point of the John Hurt subtitles, I feel, were less to show off Jon Hurt as as John Hurt, but moreso the emphasis is supposed to be on ""As The Doctor"". It's theatrical, a big reveal of sorts. This is The Doctor's greatest secret, this is what was behind his door in God Complex. What of his crimes, of so high a magnitude as to deny him the moniker of Doctor? The subtitles a re a bit of non-diagetic flair intended to emphasize the revelation and it's implications. For me, It's a lot more forgivable because it's at the very end of the episode. 

Now, onward to your lazy scripting points:

* River saying The Doctor's Name

River, in her insubstantial form, is able to somehow network with the Tardis (not so much of a stretch, as she can fly the thing like a champ). The GI knows how guarded a secret the name of The Doctor is, and in his campaign to humiliate and defeat The Doctor, forces upon him a dilemma: What does the blood-soaked doctor hold more dearly? His secrets? Or the lives of his faithful companions? In order to save The Doctor from that choice, River opens the tomb, thereby appeasing the GI whilst denying him the name of The Doctor. The GI, it would appear, is either ignorant of the importance of the Doctor's name, or is more fixated on his revenge that lies within the tomb, and so calls off the whispermen and forces The Doctor to lead them onward.

The tragic alternative to this is that The Name of The Doctor is ""Please"".

* The GI vs Clara in Timeline fragment survivability

It's heavily implied that the reason the GI immediately burnt up was because, as he states earlier, he is information, a bodiless being, as immaterial as River. The Doctor dives in and manages to save the original Clara. He says that he is ""crossing his own timeline in the biggest way possible"" and whether this is with or without repercussion remains to be seen. The GI was only information and so could only influence the happenings of the doctor's timeline. Clara ended up split into multiple beings, each having lived a full life from, only subconsciously remembering the final words of the original Clara. Now, as we see in the episode, Clara ends up in this sort of nexus where all the different regenerations are running by. Seeing as The Doctor is already at every place in his timeline, it seems plausible that he should be able to find this nexus with a tolerable amount of difficulty. Defenses have been lowered to look for Clara/are nonexistent in the timeline and so, BAM. Introducing John Hurt as The Plot Twist. 

Taking a break for breakfast. I'll be back soon.
