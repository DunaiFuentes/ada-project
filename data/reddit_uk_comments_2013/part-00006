Having too many central players is killing us which is why Marin and Moses are a breath of fresh air when they come on. They pull defenders out rather than crowd the box. 

Oscar playing RM/RW just brings more defenders closer to other team mates as he drifts in and Ramires doesn't do anything other than run up and down. Oscar really needs to be shifted to play alongside Luiz as sub for Lampard.

true,peterjoel,uk,United Kingdom,"When I was a student, 13 years ago, I had a summer job at a small security firm, counting money.

Each day they picked up cash from MacDonald's, Netto, Wilkinson's and a few other high street chains. In the evening we'd count it, bag it up and load it into crates to be taken to the bank in the morning.

It was unusual to hit £10M in a night, but it did happen a few times. I think typically it would be around £4M.

There was a coin room, full of the noisiest machines. The notes counters were smaller and nicer. (If you've seen Breaking Bad, they were similar to the note counter they use in the first series).

Two weeks before I started, someone was fired - and eventually jailed - for stealing. There was apparently an in-joke, that she was always going to the bathroom. Turned out she was stuffing her bra with cash. Later, people realised that she DID take a lot of expensive holidays, considering she was earning minimum wage.

On a different occasion, one of the van drivers was fired for stealing. A bag of 500x£1 was missing. It was found in the van later, but he had thrown his coat over it; presumably to collect later. That was actually really sad to see - the police ransacked his house, looking for more evidence of stealing, but this was probably the only occasion, and not even a straightforward case of theft, as the money was still in the company's van.",0,1357789753,null,0,false,0,c7u8f4o,t3_16a300,t1_c7u8f4o,t3_16a300,null,1430912400,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This was a game where we did not take our chances. This is NOT a game where we sucked (like the QPR/West Ham game), our passing till the final third was looking great. The reason we were toothless is because our mid-fielders are just that, mid-fielders, they will have days where they may not be able to bury chances, but a good strikers GETS YOU OUT OF THOSE DAYS.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Clearly the opinion of someone who has not had the misfortune to be at the receiving end of a bullying Police Officer.  I'll admit I've had no reason to have anything to do with the Police. Ever.  But when late one night a few years ago one of them stopped me and made himself look a complete tosser and just couldn't stop making it worse by relentlessly trying to make a situation out of nothing I was never forgiven.  I can only assume it was this as for what other possible reason would they suddenly start intimidating me on any pretext.  I have a lovely car, a classic car which I cherish.  No accidents that have been my fault (two in which the other party claimed full responsibility in 30 years), fully comp, taxed, job, nice house, kids at Uni.  I point these things out as I know appearances etc mean a lot to plod.

Since then I have been stopped by local police who ""didn't have a breathalyser"" so I had to wait for two hours at the roadside while one was delivered.  To add insult to injury they commented that I certainly didn't smell of drink and nor was I acting like a drunk.  But they felt compelled to make me wait alone at the roadside and warned me I'd better not smoke, while they sat in their car.   Look, I'm a 50 year old woman on my way home from work.  I don't drink and drive.

Another time they stopped me outside the local Police station late in the evening.    I immediately volunteered myself for a breathalyser test, hoping to save time.  After ten minutes conferring they said their unit was not working.  ""Fine"" I said ""we are opposite your Police Station let's go in there and do a blood test"".  No.  Another hour and half while they questioned me on strangely random aspects of my personal life.  Even questioned my age.  ""Are you sure madam"" he said ""You look far younger than that"".  Again, this took almost two hours and I wasn't tested, just kept hanging around with some bizarre vision tests as well.

There are more than these but I'm never given a number or name.  I called my local Police Station after the most recent one and said ""Surely to God by now your officers must realise that I DO NOT DRINK and DRIVE. I was informed that the reason they kept stopping me, even though I've never been found with even a trace of alcohol in my system, is that because I'm always ""clean"" there is no crime to report and so no record of any of these encounters is kept.  And so this nightmare will carry on and I almost dread going anywhere at night now.  Another time one of them accused me of acting nervously.  ""Yes"" because you are intimidating me and I'm scared to look in my rear view mirror now in case if's one of you lot and the whole sorry scenario has to be repeated.  

Do not doubt, I mean really do not ever doubt, that they can - and will if they can get away with it - make your life some sort of hell.

I made a similar request last year and got a 2011/2012 Suarez away shirt (dark gray, adidas) that doesn't fit me (it's a medium, I wear small). I tried it on once and never put it on again because it was too big. 

The only drawback, I suppose, is that it is not an authentic jersey. It was purchased on eBay and though it looks pretty good, it isn't quiiiite the same as the real deal. For instance, the adidas stripes are more gray than silver and the pinstripes aren't as subtle, but overall I think it looks pretty good.

Further, I think when this fails, he instantly loses confidence and is pretty much useless the rest of the game.

&gt; In the early 20th century the presence of six independent operators running different Underground lines caused passengers substantial inconvenience; in many places passengers had to walk some distance above ground to change between lines. The costs associated with running such a system were also heavy, and as a result many companies looked to financiers who could supply the capital they needed to expand into the lucrative suburbs as well as electrify the earlier steam-operated lines. The most prominent of these was Charles Yerkes, an American tycoon who secured the right to build the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR) on 1 October 1900, today also part of the Northern Line. In March 1901, he effectively took control of the District and this enabled him to form the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company (MDET) on 15 July 1901. Through this he acquired the Great Northern and Strand Railway and the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway in September 1901, the construction of which had already been authorised by Parliament, together with the moribund Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway in March 1902. The GN&amp;SR and the B&amp;PCR evolved into the present-day Piccadilly Line. On 9 April the MDET became the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). The UERL also owned three tramway companies and went on to buy the London General Omnibus Company, creating an organisation colloquially known as ""the Combine"" which went on to dominate underground railway construction in London until the 1930s.

I always thought buying Torres when we did was a terrible idea, especially for the money we bought him for. It was an offer too good to refuse for Liverpool at the time and for Torres and his agent.

Not only was he off form and struggling when we bought him but he had suffered two bad injuries whilst on international duty. He wasn't the player he had been previous seasons. Abramovich got suckered, just like he did with Schevchenko.

So for me I have never thought he was good enough which is why I'd like to get rid of him as soon as possible please. 

Essien is a different matter altogether. he performed for the best seasons of his career and after two seasons of injury and recovery I think everyone came to the conclusion that his physical condition was never going to be the same. He has gone to Real primarily to work with Jose again, someone who he obviously respects. If that helps him recover some form/condition, then so be it, he will always be welcome back at the bridge and I regard him as a Chelsea player unlike Torres who has never integrated himself with the squad/club.

In a shared house in which the landlord lives offsite I believe you'll get a lock on your bedroom door, for example. But it's probably more important that you're not living with someone who has an investment in being a dick to you.

Pretty much every living arrangement will involve some degree of compromise. I can hear my neighbours' music quite clearly, but I don't go bitching to them about it because have no idea how loud it must seem to them when I watch a movie.

When you live with a landlord all the compromise will be on your part - it's their house, so they feel entitled to play their music as loud as they like and not be disturbed by yours.

I was a lodger with a few landlords when I was younger, and they were rarely satisfactory - far more usually a nightmare.

Living lodger &amp; landlord is just a loaded situation.

**1. Formation flexibility**
With only 4 CMs, we are stuck with always playing with 2 deeper and 1 more advanced player. It has almost completely cut out the 4-3-3 possibilities. We changed to 4-3-3 in one game this season (whichever game was before the first Juve), where Ramires and Lampard was either side of Mikel. I like the 4-3-3 in Europe because it gives us greater cover when our wingers inevitably don't track back. Generally, it's always good to have different cards to play. Having only 4 DMs meant we could barely even try 4-3-3 because a) Romeu doesn't fit into any position except the holder, and b) Lampard is almost 40.

The lack of CM covers has also led to inflexibility in the 4-2-3-1 line-ups. We can rarely play Ramires at RW to cover for that super-fucking-fast-and-EPO-induced-LB. Sometimes you need a defensive winger. Moses (!) is the closest we have, and he had practically no defensive responsibilities at Wigan. Oscar is wonderful at tracking, but I prefer him as the AM if he starts in Europe because he battles better than Mata. Throw Mata on whichever side Ramires isn't. Alternatively, get Malouda in there in the Bertrand role (Malouda is 2x the two-way player Bertrand is at this point).

My point here is that we could have thrown out a front six away from home against a tough side of Mikel, Essien, Mata, Ramires, Malouda, and Moses/Torres, which could get a 0-0 draw. We're not good enough the control the game? Fine, let's do what we did last year away and win at home. Shakthar are great when you give them a shit ton of space to counter. So let's shut up shop, out-muscle them, track all their runs, and counter them. 

This infuriated me.

**2. Cover for Injuries**
The Lampard is almost 40 reference is just a hyperbole of life. He is getting older and more injury prone. It happened, again. With Romeu also out, suddenly we're down to 2 DMs. Now Mikel is injured and Luiz has to be trained (admirably he has played okay, but we're not winning games...) to play there at a very pivotal time in the season. It's not ideal.

**3. Inexperience**
Both Romeu and Luiz are inexperienced. The former simply due to lack of game time at high level, the latter due to new position training. We also tried playing Oscar there. He did okay (completely forgot to cover for Iva on that Sunderland goal, but that simply shows inexperience).

Point: Sure, training and gelling 1 or 2 players into different positions is okay. Getting 3 into the same position? Not good.


TL;DR: I'm bitter we let Essien go on loan. If Mourinho think he has a purpose in a less-physical league than the EPL, then we for sure as hell have use for him. He's a good guy. He works hard. He looked good pre-season. 

Sure, he was injured, but throw a Bison some grass and see if he can't stir up a feast.",0,1357802623,null,0,false,0,c7ubvky,t3_16aivz,t1_c7ubvky,t3_16aivz,null,1430914116,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

*Big Finish* was created in the ""wilderness years"" (when there was no TV show in production) as a way for *Doctor Who* fans to have more adventures featuring their favourite Doctor without the need of a television budget or ratings race. Many people working on the current TV series have contributed to *Big Finish* including David Tennant, Mark Gatiss, Nick Briggs, Rob Shearman and Mark Gatiss.

The benefit of this format is that while many of the actors now look much older than when they played the Doctor, they still sound very similar to their original tenure in the role. Close your eyes and it's like watching an all-new adventure from the classic series - with decidedly better visuals provided by your imagination than an old BBC budget would have given us.

For complete newcomers I recommend any of the eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller adventures as a place to start. It's quite relatable to the tone of the current series.

Disclaimer before I start: I count myself as British and Northern Irish and am fairly happy with that, but it really has virtually no significance in my life beyond a predilection for tea and Monty Python. If reunification happened tomorrow, it would have no effect on my life and I'd be happy to be Irish and Northern Irish. Anyway…

If I went to the Republic of Ireland, it doesn't matter how much I ""identify"" with the Union Flag, I wouldn't expect it to be flown over a government building. You can't just hoist up another country's flag because you have a fancy to it (yes, I appreciate this is grossly oversimplifying the history of Northern Ireland). Regardless of whether 25% of Northern Ireland view themselves as Irish (source: 2011 census), the absolute fact is that Northern Ireland is currently part of the United Kingdom, the flag of which is the Union Flag.

However, the decision made to fly it on designated days only is, in my opinion, absolutely the correct one. It brings us in line with the rest of the UK and there is absolutely no precedent for flying it 365 days a year (beyond the crazy voices in Unionists' heads). Given that the Union Flag has had a dual purpose in this country, both as the legal emblem and as a tawdry territorial marking, anyone wanting it flying every day is clearly just wanting it as a ""fuck you"" to Nationalists. There is no logical argument for having it up every day.

Furthermore, everyone that's clamouring for discussion for a ""middle ground"" is ignoring the fact that this solution *is* the middle ground. Sinn Fein wanted it removed completely, Unionists wanted it up forever and Alliance brokered the vote to have it fly on specific days, meaning neither extreme got their demands, both of which were contrary to how the rest of the UK does it.

If, at some point in the future, the Republic has legal standing in Northern Ireland, fire two flags up. If, at some point in the future, there is Irish reunification, fire up the Tricolour. As it stands, with the legal status of Northern Ireland *right now*, the Union Flag is the only one that has legal baring on Northern Ireland.",0,1357809394,null,0,false,0,c7ucz4a,t3_169vv6,t1_c7ucz4a,t1_c7ua8vb,null,1430914639,12,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,12

Suarez, wherever he plays always seems to find a way to get past his marker. If he plays wide (and probably on the right), this means more space and time on the ball, so I expect more of his jinxing runs down the byline and cutting the ball back in for someone to ram home.

Sturridge and Suarez swapping positions during the game is also possible so I'm not that concerned about Suarez being shifted from CF where he's been scoring for fun.

People get too caught up in that term.

&gt;**Are Scottish &amp; Northern Ireland notes ""legal tender""?**
&gt;In short ‘No’ these notes are not ""legal tender""; furthermore, Bank of England notes are only legal tender in England and Wales.  Legal tender has, however, a very narrow technical meaning in relation to the settlement of debt.  If a debtor pays in legal tender the exact amount he/she owes under the terms of a contract (and in accordance with its terms), or pays this amount into court, he/she has good defence in law if he/she is sued for non-payment of the debt. In ordinary everyday transactions, the term ""legal tender"" in its purest sense need not govern a note's acceptability in transactions.  The acceptability of a Scottish or Northern Ireland note as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved. If both parties are in agreement, Scottish and Northern Ireland notes can be used in England and Wales.  Holders of genuine Scottish and Northern Ireland notes are provided with a level of protection similar to that provided to holders of Bank of England notes.  This is because the issuing banks must back their note issue using a combination of Bank of England notes, UK coin and funds in an interest bearing bank account at the Bank of England.

true,DimReaper,null,null,"Agreed. At the risk of reposting something I said in a similar thread in r/Europe, I think it's entirely reasonable that the US position on the issue is that which most benefits the US. There's nothing wrong with that, I can't fault them for wanting what's best for them. However it doesn't necessarily follow that what is best for the US is best for the UK.

From the US perspective, the UK and US have BROADLY similar economic make ups and perspectives on economic issues. The UK is a major financial centre with free access to the EU market, and a business culture positive and receptive to that of the US. Politically we have similar aims (rightly or wrongly), and are usually seen to be in agreement on foreign policy issues. We share secret intelligence and have major defence links. 

The US doesn't have similarly deep links with another EU country. The French are mildly anti-US, more so since Iraq, and Europe as a whole are more socialist, economically protectionist, and less expeditionary in foreign policy. If the UK remains in the EU, there is a voice at the top table saying things that will usually be in line with what the US wants/needs/believes. And much as the press and politicians in the UK may play it otherwise, the UK IS at the EU top table; we have a hell of a lot of votes, money, economic clout and military capability. We aren't by any stretch a dominant force, and we don't always win the argument, but what we say at least gets listened to and considered. If we left, the US would lose that voice on their wavelength, and the EU would likely become a little more economically protectionist and a little more socialist, neither of which are directly in the US interest.

None of this means that it is necessarily in the British interest to remain in the EU. It just means that it is in the US interest that we do so. But this is a comment from a US government source, so of course that is perfectly sensible and understandable. It just needs to be seen in this context rather than being taken at face value as a friend offering impartial advice, which it is not.

TL;DR? It isn't in US interests for the UK to leave the EU, but that doesn't mean that it isn't necessarily in UK interests to do so. ",0,1357811634,null,0,false,0,c7ud9dk,t3_169p6w,t1_c7ud9dk,t1_c7u3xd0,null,1430914768,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

September and october are when the problems start for most people who have problems with VM. 

Generally if you live in a high student population area then you're fucked come september. VM oversell like mad to student houses which often have 5 or more people per house, all with their own laptop, all trying to download their favourite TV shows and music. 

So they're overselling in the area anyway (IIRC they're one of the few companies that offer school year term contracts) and then essentially 4-5 times as many people are using each line too. 

It's a clusterfuck. 

I had VM and from the April I got it it was fine right up until two weeks after uni started in my area. Literally got sub 56kbps speeds during peak hours and never above about 250kbps even at 2am in the morning. 

Went on for months. Eventually I got VM to admit to me that they'd oversubscribed the area and that I could cancel **only** the internet part of my shitty VM package. Now I've been paying for a phone line and TV that I never really wanted in the first place. 

Cunts. 

If you live in a town/city with no uni near by, it's probably fine. Also, I'm not blaming students but they are the secondary cause. The first and foremost cause is VM being greedy though.

I assume once this 'super prison' will have been built, plus it says that ""proposals for a super prison were at a very early stage and stressed that this was ""a long way"" from a new site being built"".

I'm actually sad to see some of these prisons going away in favour of a new prison which will become the largest in the country.

Edit: The only place I can find the closing date mentioned is in the local paper, [the Shropshire Star, saying that these prisons will be shutting on 1st April](http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2013/01/10/shrewsbury-prison-to-be-closed-down/). Hmm.

Some of the comments there are an interesting read too.
&gt;Losing a big employer and gaining a few new homes doesn't make sense for Shrewsbury - Shropshire is becoming increasingly provincial with fewer and fewer career opportunities for those of us that live here. First the sorting office, now this.
&gt;
A vibrant town needs a mixture of housing, services and employment - Shrewsbury is becoming increasingly unbalanced. It's bad news for our town.

---
&gt;The government is right to close essentially victorian prisons which have come to the end of their useful life. However, this is yet another blow to Shropshire's economy, not only jobs in the Prison service which will be lost but also the knock on effect tyo local companies who supply the prison.


**Edit 2**: Although there's been rumours, as a person's comment said in the news article I posted above, the news today came as a shock to everyone there. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-20972071

So they're closing these prisons and transferring the prisoners to another prison? Isn't that just going to make others more full whilst reducing the places until this 'super prison' gets built?

This is a major issue, as in the long run it prevents any small business growing into an international outfit as until it breaks onto the international stage it is paying 10 or 20% more tax on its profits. 

So there are two or three ways forward: either every country reduces corporation tax close to 0, or countries agree to modify the tax rules somehow so that money can't be shifted around at whim into different tax regions. Or perhaps as you suggest a universal corporate tax regime.

If one of the above things does not happen, we will in the long run be left with a small number of international businesses who dominate smaller competitors because they pay 10 or 20% less tax. The smaller competitors will never be able to make enough profits to climb up the ladder and expand into other countries in order to take advantage of intra-country tax differences.",0,1357818505,null,0,1357825907,0,c7ue08o,t3_168vrl,t1_c7ue08o,t1_c7ucuap,null,1430915118,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

To continue creating art. To help those who need it. Or if you aren't so inclined, to make money, grow the economy, fight wars and buy stuff.""

The state should be able to pick up where parents have to leave off. Most parents cannot afford private education, so taxes go towards state education. Most parents cannot afford private healthcare, so taxes go towards state health care.

When we cannot trust parents to care for their children, the state steps in. Until that point we trust parents to take care of children's finances. Without food shelter and clothing, education and healthcare are meaningless. This will mean either giving parents money to meet these needs, or meeting these needs directly.

Unless you are advocating state murder, one cannot retrospectively abort foetuses or implement contraception. Children should not be punished for their parent's circumstances. Your arguments may work in respect to the dole or housing benefit (if you do not believe in a safety net), but are not fair in respect to children.

If a farmer grows a ton of food and only sells half a ton, he will still charge for a almost a full ton because it still cost him to grow the wasted food (which may be sold to a processor at a low rate).

It is actually to the supermarkets own benefit to reduce the restrictions as it lowers the overall cost of the food they buy.

No, never. You NEVER have to speak to the Police. Even when arrested or being interviewed. However do bear in mind what it says when you're cautioned after being arrested.

""it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.""

&gt; Can he search me without any good reason?

No. He has to have reasonable grounds to do so. Which he will have to justify in court should he be required. Gone are the days of the Police stopping and searching anyone for anything, unless you're in the middle of a riot, or you're suspected of terrorism. And it's incredibly tedious and difficult to justify terrorism. It usually involves MI5 being involved. Police won't just say it in order to search you.

You're more within your rights to do so yes. But any Officer worth his salt will make sure your hands are out of the way when he's searching you. Usually raised in front of you with your hands full (your jacket, wallet etc) so that If you decide to attack him he'll have time to react.

And finally, everything the Police officer does will be recorded and justified as if the case goes to court his actions will be scrutinised relentlessly.

Hope that clears it up for you!

Unfortunately, you'll have to forgive me for this digression but I'm going to take the issue of higher education to make my point, as that's something I'm more well versed in than business. According to this [paper](http://www.international.ac.uk/media/1515947/Recommendations%20to%20Support%20UK%20Outward%20Student%20Mobility.pdf), there are more EU students studying in the UK compared to the other way round. Some possible reasons for this: cost, language, perception of better educational institutions in the UK. But, at least in my experience of choosing a university in 2007/2008, I never remember once being told that I *could* study abroad without paying tuition fees. 

Admittedly, when it comes to business things are different, and I don't have nearly enough knowledge to form a valid opinion, but I don't see much changing, especially in terms of the City. Our financial services, law firms, and insurance companies are among the best in the world and will continue to be sought after if we leave the EU, but what is the impact on smaller businesses that do benefit from membership of the EU? Again, I'm not sure entirely how they are affected and whether a majority lose rather than gain but I think this further highlights the need for a fully comprehensive educational phase before any referendum can be taken.

Also, with regards to lack of British workers going the other way, is a major factor of that language and the fact that foreign language standards here are horrible?

true,ksturgis,null,null,"You say you disagree with me, which part? Are you suggesting that Torres *did* lose us this game? That he is more culpable for this loss than any other player? I assume you are not suggesting this, bc you honestly could not be that short sighted. It would be easy to pinpoint this loss (if we had to place blame on one single player) on Ivanovic if anyone...and I still think that's just lazy. No one played well (with the exception of Ba in the final 10 mins) and to suggest any one player is more responsible than the others, especially Torres, is simply absurd. 

You mentioned this was a game where we did not take our chances, but again, Torres really wasn't one of the culprits. Mata, Iva, Luiz, Rams and Hazard all missed opportunities. The obvious criticism would be that Torres didn't really miss any opportunities bc he didnt create any (which is true). But at the end of the day, yesterdays loss really had no more to do with Torres' performance (or lack thereof) than anyone else in the squad. Yet when sifting through this post game thread (just like every other thread after a loss) Torres is the scapegoat. The player who receives the most criticism, and ultimately takes the blame for WHY we lost (see all the comments saying, ""if we only had a capable striker we'd be beating every team 36-0!"") As I said, it's not only tiresome, it's quite lazy to blame Torres for all our problems, yet EVERYONE continues to do it after every loss. It is the least redeeming quality of this subreddit.

However, what I was trying to suggest not being able to speak the *native* language of that country could be a psychological or actual barrier to not being able to work outside the EU. To give an example, there is a British law firm that has an office in Denmark. They stipulate on the careers section of the Danish office that one should be fluent or at least an advanced user of Danish before they should consider ~~replying~~ applying. If many other companies have these same regulations, and British worker Joe only speaks English, isn't that something we should adapt to, with our attitudes towards learning foreign languages to mirror that of the rest of the world's attitude towards English? Improving this could lead to many more workers migrating away from the UK, balancing out the free movement of worker problems.

I know this is an oversimplification. I think it is fairly safe to assume many workers who come here are unskilled or labour workers and the example I gave requires high levels of education but is that not a feasible attitude problem with British society?

I have personal reasons for this as I have non-EU friends who get tripped up by the visa system very frequently.

I love my British passport because it not only allows me to live and work in this country but also allows me entry for work or pleasure in many other countries. If the UK leaves the EU, and we lose this connection, I think it would be a terrible loss of personal mobility for most British people. Even if we don't all move abroad, the option is there, and I for one feel better for it being there.

Cutting ourselves off from the nearest landmass is not going to make us any friends, and I don't think that our economy can survive with this kind of isolationist mindset. I certainly would rather have closer ties to the other EU countries than continue the ""special relationship"" with the US.

Obviously, the management of the EU would have to become far more transparent, directly accountable and directly elected for me to support a full integration into some big federal state. But going completely in the opposite direction, ie. leaving the EU, seems a dangerous move to me. The kind of move that would burn a lot of bridges for a very long time.

true,chimpychimp,null,null,"I failed 4 times, passed on my fifth with no minors or majors. I was 17 when I started learning, and it took me 9 years to finally pass.

1) Always show you are in control of your car. Apply the hand brake every time when stopping or doing manoeuvres, even if you are on level ground. A slight decline/incline and the car will roll. Even if it only rolls a tiny bit, you have lost control of the vehicle = fail.

2) Always do observation checks, even if you don't think you need to or know its clear. If need be, make them more exaggerated than normal so the examiner can clearly see you are doing it. Don't forget that blind spot.

3) Get non-lesson based experience. This was by far the most important thing for me, as due to parental issues I never ever drove a car without a driving instructor next to me. After repeated failure, I eventually bought a car and got some driving time in with friends and other people. I stopped being a learner driver and became a real driver. You have to be the one driving the car, not merely following instructions.

4) Be aware what other people are doing, because they do fucking stupid shit and it will fuck you up and cause you to fail. If you are turning right into a junction and the oncoming car flashes you to let you go, don't go UNLESS that car comes to a complete stop. If he does, inform the examiner that because the car has stopped and flashed you, that you are going to turn because he is causing you to hold up traffic. If you just turn whilst he is still moving towards you, you have just failed.

5) If told to find a safe place to pull over, indicate and STOP INDICATING when you have parked. Its easy to forget. When you are ready to pull out, DONT START INDICATING until you have a good window to move out. Once you have a gap, indicate, then check it is still safe and clear to move, and then move. If it suddenly becomes unsafe, I would advise turning off your indicator and waiting for another opportunity. It sounds stupid, but otherwise drivers will slow down thinking you are going to pull out, and it generally can cause a clusterfuck where you fail.

6) You need to drive at a reasonable speed, but always drive at a speed appropriate to the conditions. If you are going through town center and its busy, you might want to stay second gear. The limit is 30, but its down to judgement about what is safe. You can always mention it to the examiner (""Im staying at 20mph because its busy and pedestrians keep crossing in front of me"").

7) Book your tests for easy times. You had an exam during rush hour, making it much much harder. I would suggest any time between 10 and 11:30 for a morning exam, or 2 and 3 pm for an afternoon exam. Those are quiet times, with much less traffic. Less traffic means less problems for you.

8) Everyone gets nervous during the driving test. On my last one (where I passed) I thought I was going to be physically sick. On previous exams the stress often caused me to panic and make poor or inappropriate decisions, resulting in fails. There is no magic bullet to this, and I have heard all sorts - from the Kalms tablets to a mother doping her daughter with valium because she got that hysterical before each test. I don't have an answer for this, I dealt with it by being nervous as fuck anyway but I got myself really pumped up by listening to certain songs before hand. Run rabbit junk from the ghost in the shell anime is a kickass song, and really helped me get mentally pumped up.

9) This is the most important tip, so I have saved it for last. **DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU ARE TAKING YOUR TEST.** Don't you dare. Every time I told people, and after every fail I had to suffer the humiliation and indignation of explaining why I had failed to each person that asked. I believe not telling anyone is the real secret to why I passed. I was so mentally drained from failing and then having to explain why I failed to a dozen people or more each time, I actually ended up stopping driving all together - which is why it took me almost a decade to eventually pass. I hated it, and felt like a total failure.

Many of you will by now know that our Mum and Dad's property was burgled whilst they were away between Christmas and the afternoon of 6th Jan 2013. Our family home was completely ransacked and many many items are missing. Our Dad had a cardiac arrest shortly after discovering the break in and died.

The incident occured in the HEATON GRANGE area of ROMFORD. We have reason to believe that the property was accessed at 0:30hrs on Wednesday 2nd January 2013 and again at 3.00am on that date. The property would have remained accessible until Sunday 6th January 2013 and it is possible that return visits may have been made during that period.

Items missing include a Passport and bank cards in the name of Raymond Grinyer. Many items of jewellery were taken including our Mum's 60th Wedding Anniversary Eternity ring (pictured) . Also an older style very large vodka bottle (pictured) which was full of 20p pieces - this weighed about 2 stone and both these items would be easily recognisable.

If you have any information or can help us in any way whatsoever, however small or insignificant you feel it may be, please call Romford CID 01708 779209 or 01708 779264. If you are unable to contact through these numbers please call 101. Remember if you wish to make anonymous contact call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. Crime reference remains the same at 5400303/13. This incident is now being treated as more than a burglary.

We appeal to our facebook friends to HIT SHARE and help us pursue justice for our Dad so that he may rest in the knowledge justice has been done. We would be particularly grateful for the word to be spread in and around the Harold Hill/Collier Row, and extended Essex area.

Please please SHARE. Thank you for your support.
The Grinyer Family

I think your mistake was requesting a court date.

IANAL but from my experience, if you're given a fixed-penalty fine by the plod, then paying it is *not* an admission of guilt and incurs no criminal record (it should say so in the small print on the back of the ticket, I think).

Having requested a court date - well, obviously, if the magistrate finds you guilty then you'll get a criminal record.

It's also at 1:03 (I don't know why they have such odd times) which *should* be OK, but just have to watch out for any flashing 20's or school skivers.

The assessment could have come from a government press release, spin that has been rejected by an overwhelming majority of GPs. The BBC has also repeatedly failed to cover public protests, including one outside the Department of Health which stopped the traffic in Whitehall for an hour.

&gt;‘When the BBC have reported on the bill they have been sparse with their explanations of its implications or the reasons why so many - including most medical professionals - have objected to it. They have tended to limit their comments to those of the type “Some people say it's privatisation” without explaining why or exploring the issue.

I have never understood this. What is the point of taxing and then adding subsidies, shoudnt the system instead be structured so that he just pays less tax at specific brackets?

The result would be the same, but instead of being given money back he simply woudn't have as much taken.

Those old flats were shittily built to begin with, then they eventually ended up being filled with the kind of people who don't look after their dwellings, which coupled with the council's reluctance to fix things has turned them into large hulking wrecks.

If we built modern buildings, and built them using the latest technology, whatever that may be, we could end up with a very nice collection of flats.  We could possibly heat and illuminate the public parts of the building using solar power and we could have fibre optic broadband going right to each flat.

The only problem is that prices seem to be inflated despite the recession so they would end up costing a fortune to buy.  Renting is bad because tenants generally don't give a fuck about keeping the place in shape, especially those on welfare who aren't footing the bill.

But they're not just strangers, they're the police. They **have** to do things strangers wouldn't, and you have to acknowledge and accept that.

You didn't stop. You forced their hand. It's your fault. You need to man up and accept that.

The only widely circulated salary figure I can find is Carlton @ 90,000 p/a, which is a job he took 6 years after graduating.

This page:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5305385/Oliver-Letwins-tennis-court-repairs-MPs-expenses.html suggests that the **Chairman** of the Conservative Research Department receives a salary of £64,776, and since we can be fairly sure that Cameron didn't join as chairman, it seems unlikely he was on £100k+.

Sure, he used his connections, but would appreciate some facts to back up the claim he got paid 100k straight out of uni.

Also worth noting that he got a 1st in PPE at Oxford. This would basically get him pretty much any job he wanted. A friend of mine joined a top IB straight out of Oxford PPE and started on something like 70k inc. bonus. That degree is a license to print money (and a first isn't something you get without some seriously hard work), and if Cameron had joined one of the banks out of uni, he'd have been on a lot more than 100k a few years after graduating.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"Depends on the car, it it's a 1l hatch then that makes sense. Try doing that in a powerful car and you'll kangaroo it as there is too much power available. 

The trick in doing this in a slightly more-powerful car (e.g. 1.3l) is to match revs when downshifting. E.g you are at 20mph in 2nd gear and the engine is at 3000RPM (totally made up numbers BTW). To go down to 1st gear at that speed you need 5000RPM on the engine, so as you downshift you also press the accelerator pedal to bring it up to the right speed. If done right your passengers won't even know you've changed gear, it will be a completely smooth transition. 

Wait until you pass your test before you start messing with this stuff, it's all down to the individual car. I just got a new one and I'm still trying to get to grips with perfecting it, on my last car I could do it instinctively without needing to look at the gauges.

My big criticism of Dzeko is that he doesn't retain possession as well as some (any) of our other strikers, but he's certainly one of our most clinical.  Without Yaya in the midfield and against Arsenal I don't think we can expect to see anything like the amount of possession we normally do.  I think we need to take the chances we get, and that seems more likely to happen with Dzeko up top.

true,[deleted],null,null,"She blamed the workers of this country for the state of the economy. Along with the media.  It was the unions that were to blame. Going on strikes, demanding pay rises. She set out to dismantle everything she saw as a threat. Most of the embers of socialist Britain were smashed, state utilities were sold off. Council housing was sold off. Unions were attacked. Employment laws were ""liberated"" a mere slice of her governments activities. 

Her policies produced boom and bust economic cycles, people started to get used to losing their homes and going bankrupt at rates never before experienced. 

The truth was though, we were never to blame in the first place the people of the country didnt cause the economic conditions which brought her to power. 

Those conditions were created by an oil price that increased from $20 to over $70 between 1970 and 1982 when they dropped steeply and dramatically because of over production by OPEC. 

During the 1970s and 1980s we were in a series of deep recessions, but so was the whole western world. 

In the mid 1980s when the oil price reduced it was like living in another era. Money was everywhere, jobs were everywhere, the nightmare end of the financial cycle had ended. But it had nothing to do with Thatcher's policies. We, the UK, are a cog in a wheel of the global system and when a key component of that global system triples in price everyone suffers. Thatcher never mentioned that. She mentioned how it was out fault, us, the British workers, the British people. You were to blame, socialism was to blame, the unemployed were to blame. She lied to all of us and carried out a root and branch attack on anything that threatened her. She was a liar Margaret Thatcher, she lacked integrity Margaret Thatcher. She sold our nation's assets Margaret Thatcher. 

None of the other European countries attacked their own people in the way Margaret Thatcher did. They saw the same economic cycles.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I appreciate your point, especially regarding Aidan White. My post was made out of exasperation; we do need someone with pace **and** ball control or positioning (especially the latter in the case of a defender). I would have written that, but when you start going into specifics then the point loses its sharpness.

The problem with arguably our two fastest players, White and Poleon, is that their ball control is poor and their decision-making is little better. White is better at making decisions than Poleon, but his ball control is among the worst I've ever seen. His idea of dribbling is kicking the ball far in front of him and running after it. It's embarrassing when you compare it to Thomas's tight, close-control dribbling technique.

However, I must say that although our crosses have been atrocious at times, we do have some players who can swing a good cross in. Specifically, they are McCormack, Diouf and Tonge. However, the problem is that none of them have any real pace. Consequently, they're either swinging crosses in that defenders can attack with their back to goal, or we have to put together an exceptionally lucky or skillful move. If you have pace and know how to use it, then you can just drive straight through a defence, or stretch them to the point that you can play a through ball that sets the player on his way, and suddenly you're putting balls in that defenders have to clear while facing their own goal.

Of course, this relies on having a player like Thomas (when he was interested in playing well, like he was against Crystal Palace and the first half against Chelsea) in the team, as he possesses both good ball control and decision-making.

However, I would also love to have someone - anyone - in our defence with pace. This is much more difficult in the Championship, as fast defenders with good positional awareness are like gold dust. You'll find them more often than not in the Champions League. Even so, I'm just sick and tired of our defence getting cut open by pace - it's happened twice in the last week alone, against Hull and Birmingham. Byram and Lees have a bit of pace to them (it's certainly obvious with Lees, compared to Tate and Pearce); Peltier is meant to have some but I honestly haven't seen it; while Pearce, Tate and Drury certainly don't have any.",0,1357846721,null,0,false,0,c7ulchu,t3_16b7px,t1_c7ulchu,t1_c7ujgn6,null,1430918666,5,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,5

* Over exaggerate your mirror checks. Purposefully turn your head and do it much more often than you'd expect to. Just show that you're constantly aware of what's happening around you. The bulk of my minors (3) were for not checking my mirror when approaching junctions, even really small country/small town road junctions. Just keep on checking.
* Breathe slowly before! Sounds silly but it does help you focus when you do get in the car.
* Don't signal pedestrians. I know everyone does it on the main road but examiners can see it has being ambiguous.
* BOOK YOUR TEST AT SUITABLE TIMES. Not when there's going to be loads of traffic. So not at school drop off time when mums who don't know how to drive 4x4s are on the road, not at lunch because there's a slight increase in traffic and certainly not at rush hour. Something between 10-12, or 1:30-4:30 is probably the best.
* Don't tell anybody you're taking it. It's fine the first time but for retakes of the test it just relieves a bit of stress.
* Ultimately and finally, just relax. Treat it like a normal driving lesson. If your driving instructor has entered you for a test then he obviously thinks you're at a good enough standard. Good luck!

*Edit:* Also, be nice to the examiners however moody they may be. You sometimes do need that element of luck both on and off the road.",0,1357846755,null,0,false,0,c7ulcxv,t3_16b5z3,t1_c7ulcxv,t3_16b5z3,null,1430918671,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The background IS important, because it’s hypocritical of people who got free education, healthcare, welfare, apprenticeships, jobs for life and all the benefits of a socialised society to deny those to other people. And it’s just a lie to claim that they’re strivers and people who DON’T achieve are therefore scroungers. Cameron and Osborne were given HUGE opportunities and benefits.

&gt;Capitalism rewards winners, but to have winners you must, logically, have losers. No amount of “incentives to work” can avoid that – you simply make it more miserable. The best way to mitigate against losers is to redistribute from the winners – that way nobody gets left too far behind.

&gt;I would also argue that it’s economically idiotic to reduce benefots. It won’t cause jobs to be created, it will just suck money out of the real economy. Even the World Bank now argues that austerity is harming economies (including UK).

&gt;The truth is, the poor spend their money, the rich save it because they don’t need it as much. But only the MOVEMENT of capital can make the economy grow. Saving doesn’t cause growth, spending does. So removing money from people who spend 100% their income is crazy. You’re taking money out of the economy at a time when you should be putting more in.

&gt;A windfall tax on private corporations who have (for example) increased profits since 2008 and have held over £10 million during that period – that would make sense and be fair, because those people have made money from the recession, and are therefore likely to be extending it. And their profits are dead money, investing in nothing and achieving nothing. There are £billions locked up like that. Tax it at 10%, and give the money to the poorest 10% of people – who will spend it almost immediately, because many of them are desperate and have debts. So the money is instantly injected into the economy, leading to growth, and ensuring and the donor companies will get it back within 3 years.

&gt;Yes, it’s classic Keynsian economics. But it’s classic because it works. The EMF did a study of austerity measures since 1980 (176 instances of it). In every case, austerity caused deeper financial and monetary problems and extended recession. Whereas in every case of the Keynsian, the recession ended and growth returned. It’s only being prevented by gruesome mixture of idealism and dogma.

&gt;I’m a lefty, and make no apologies about it. But I’m also primarily a rationalist, and regardless of politics, this stuff is basic economics.

Sorry, I don't think 16k people didn't get home from work until 9pm because of flag protests/riots. We'll see what happens this week, but as I've said I've yet to be put out at all by these things. And the nearest protest to me has been about ~200m away.

&gt;Woah, where did this come from? And how is it relevant to the current situation?

It's relevant because this is what 'disruption' really means - if people keep going on about the dark old days returning because they arrive late home/a cancelled meal they've got their head up their ass. Losing loved ones is infinitely worse. 

&gt;Sadly, anti-terror operations are a part of modern day life.

So it's true then, you've just accepted republican violence as normality. I don't and never will.

&gt;The point is that a small and exceptionally vocal minority have directly contributed a £7 million bill, in policing operations, in little over a month.

Is that not what the IRA are? A small and ~~vocal~~ violent minority? Why should we accept that as normal? 

&gt;Not really over the past decade and beyond, especially when compared to what was going on during the Troubles. 

Except I'm not comparing the level of IRA violence today with what was happening during the Troubles, I'm comparing it with so-called loyalist street protests and riots. And from were I stand, there's a lot more energy being expended keeping us safe from republicans then any other threat in NI. Maybe you'll have a point when in 2021 we can revisit things if the flag protest is still ongoing. Until then, to compare this incident with the many attempts on people's lives over the past decade is pretty obvious head-in-sand stuff.

Honestly, the lengths some people go to ""I got delayed getting home, this is sooo much worse then anything else"" when they are complaining about a few streets worth of trouble on the one hand then immediately discount murder and bombing runs on the other. It's a strange imbalance in outlook.

&gt;Personally, I think a significant cause is not that the party doesn't have support, but that most people are politically disinterested beyond voting every 3/4/5 years.

Except that I'm not referring to most people, I'm specifically pointing out Alliance are far more likely to both target and receive votes from mainly protestant electoral areas. When is the sectarian busting self-declared middleground going to actually put their money where their mouth is?

&gt;So, the same as any other political party across the free world?

Wasn't one of the shite Belfast dailies telling us we're all Alliance voters the other month? I hope their circulation matches the Alliance percentage of the vote in Newry &amp; Mourne. You'd think it was the 2nd coming such was the rubbish talked up about the people whose mismanagement of the issues lead us into this mess.

&gt;you have some sort of grudge or other bad feeling towards the Alliance party.

Yep. I find their naivety utterly incomprehensible. A mixture of that and a disgust at their electioneering battle with the DUP over the head of this. They've done nothing to bridge the divide here. Nothing.

&gt;How should the party that essentially holds the swing of the vote proceed?

I'll tell you exactly how. Seek a compromise by all means, but do so in a balanced fashion, ie not just in your target constituency (for Alliance, the upper/middle class protestant demographic) but like actual statespeople interested in true reconciliation, make it conditional on *all* councils adopting it as an NI-wide policy. At the very least, **ensure you're voting partners aren't about to ok the naming of a park somewhere else after a fucking terrorist, or campaigning to release another one who tried to kill the man sitting opposite them in the council chamber**. 

Newton Emerson was right. There's only one word that springs to mind for that sort of behaviour, and what was the sum total of Alliance efforts? Sweet, fuck, all. They are a parody of true reconciliation. Another twee self-interest group along the lines of the Women's Coalition, the crowning moment of which for me was when the MP for east Belfast, with her constituency being at the centre of rioting, had the ear of every journalist in town. 

What great leadership did she display that day? Yup, that's right, Naomi Long called on others to 'display leadership'. What exactly where you elected MP for then?

And that's what you get with Alliance. The same old ineffective dross in a different coloured badge.",0,1357847269,null,0,false,0,c7uljq2,t3_167foe,t1_c7uljq2,t1_c7u6q7r,null,1430918758,-1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-1

One thing to know is that, about Man City, they just recently got their money.  

A good site to follow them would be through royalbluemersey.com and various twitter/fbook accounts such as Grand Old Team or Toffeebook.  Also, there are several references/forums listed on the right side banner to help you out as well.  

Lastly, one thing to do is look up the story of Tony Hibbert and the absolute hilarity that happened this summer with his testimonial game.  ""When Hibbo Scores, We Riot"" still makes me lol hard.

Edit: also to point out there were sympathetic views to hitler throughout the English establishment and to a lesser extent the public up until hitler rolled into Prague February 1939. If you read orwell's review of mein kempf he remarks that up until 1938-9 prefaces were sympathetic to hitler. Even after WWII there were more sympathetic views of hitler - see ajp's Taylor's Britain 1914-45 in the Oxford history of England.

Sure, there have been contract disputes and personal differences in the past.

Edit: A bit of tougher advice. Look, the very concept of 'spare time' is something that you have when all your other commitments are met. Get a job, then integrate all of your activities with the idea of having some time spare. A job isn't just about the (probably poor) salary you will get. It will change you - if it's a lousy job, it will help you understand that you have to work really hard to have a chance of getting a better one. If it's a great job, it will help you understand what you're good at and what you might do in the next 60+ years.

true,thegoldenmandenis,null,null,"&gt; The truth is, the poor spend their money, the rich save it because they don’t need it as much. But only the MOVEMENT of capital can make the economy grow. Saving doesn’t cause growth, spending does. So removing money from people who spend 100% their income is crazy. You’re taking money out of the economy at a time when you should be putting more in.

This is very true and is also something I have thought is silly about these changes.

The fact is that there aren't enough jobs around at the moment, and that's why a lot of people are unemployed. Not because they aren't trying and they don't work hard enough, it's because there's not enough work out there. This government is extremely weak on policies to do anything about that, and their policies to cut the deficit aren't working because they have focused solely on the deficit at the expense of growth. They cut public sector spending drastically and rapidly without giving the private sector enough time to recover. This hurt the private sector (because ultimately a lot of public sector money gets spent in the private sector) and pushed us back into recession. If they hadn't cut things so rapidly, the economy would have recovered quicker, more people would have jobs, there would be more tax revenue, there would be a lower benefit bill, and therefore there would be more money to pay off the bloody deficit that they're so obsessed with.

I'm also fed up with their analogy of the deficit being the nation's credit card. This suggests that it's a small pool of money to be dipped into for the occasional big item of spending but not something to really be lived on. It isn't the nation's credit card, it's more like the nation's mortgage.

Also I am tired of hearing commentary like this: ""here's soandso out wide, Becchio is in the box, what kind of cross can they deliver...? Aaaaaand that goes out for a goal kick"".

If White had even a shred of decision making ability and the confidence to actually take players on he would actually be quite a useful player. If more of his runs ended up like the one against Everton... Such a frustrating player to watch.

I agree with you re Diouf McCormack and Tonge but personally I'd like to see McCormack in the middle actually taking shots, and generally doing what he did last season rather than out wide, as we know how great a finisher he can be rather than wasting him out wide. That's why I think its crucial we actually get some wingers in and an actual left back so people can play in their preferred positions. Its worrisome that Warnock has said he's tried to negotiate with 7 or 8 players and has been rejected. I can see it being a very frustrating time.

Our defence has been poor for years, even in the league 1 promotion year it was slow and most definitely our weakest link. I don't think I have been confident in a CB pairing at Leeds since we sold Ferdinand... Lees has been doing alright but I don't think Tate or Pearce are playing particularly well at the moment.

Who? The girl who the prosecution are arguing falsely claimed rape? If you read the article you'd see that even the police acknowledge that no false rape allegation happened:

&gt;She **initially claimed that he had raped her**.""

&gt;""But when what she was saying was examined more closely by the police **it was clear that she was not in fact saying he had raped her** and no further action was taken.""

Dunno what the fuck is up with that wording, or why that is glossed over in the article like that either, but saying that you hope the 'bitch gets what she deserves' when in reality she hasn't done anything (police say it wasn't a false rape allegation and she also wasn't a part of the gang that did the attack) is ridiculous. We also don't know why it later became clear she wasn't saying he raped her. Was it confusing wording about another sexual assault? Misleading questioning by the police at the start?

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"It's a pretty clear ethical distinction, there is no argument to be had here: There are things that people do by choice that are their own business, and there are things that people forcibly do to others against their will. These are not things to be compared.

Harm reduction is irrelevant when it comes to harming other people against their will, which is why the rape comparison. By legalising rape you would a) reduce the suffering and even deaths of rape victims, and be able to afford them better care, but b) you would increase the incidence of rape.

But here's the thing: Forcibly mutilating someone's genitals is generally considered to be a worse crime than rape.

Rapes happen. We can reduce harm, even deaths, by legalising it.

You are basically sanctioning harming innocent victims on the premise that ""they might be harmed somewhere else, possibly worse, if we don't"". Who stands by and lets others come to harm because it's too inconvenient, dangerous, or might hurt someone's feelings? That is how people get away with atrocities - that is always how people have got away with atrocities, by people not speaking out en masse when they see something that is wrong. And this issue is an atrocity being carried out, in public, legally, for those reasons.

But if it was not allowed in the first place, no one would ever argue for it to be made legal, not in the entirety of the rest of human civilisation. Only when people's perceptions are twisted by historic and religious arguments does any other conclusion come from this. But that doesn't change the fact that we know it's wrong, right now.

Just like we know FGM is wrong - and happens in countries where it's illegal - *and* harm would be reduced if it were done legally and free in hospitals... but.. oh.. oh wait, yeah that's right, you're not for that at all, what a surprise!

The point was that you are part of the problem, not the entirety of the problem. If there wasn't a merry band of property investors and speculators then perhaps the £125k house wouldn't be so pricey and someone could actually buy it with a view to using it as a home.

She didn't care, these people weren't from the south east, they were labour supporters, socialists, the enemy.

It was a fight that the mining industry brought upon itself. Thatcher saw what happened the previous time the miners went on strike; at the time much of our power was coal-generated, which meant we couldn't run the country.

No chance she was going to let that happen again. So she started stockpiling enormous quantities of coal - enough to keep the country going for a hell of a long time in the event of another dispute.

Time passes; a number of mines have reached the end of their workable life. Plans are announced to close them; the entire mining industry goes on strike (huge problem with nationalised industry: the entire damn industry can go on strike). Scargill - leader of the Union - thought he had a massive negotiating advantage because of the country's dependency on coal. It seems nobody mentioned to him that the country had such an enormous stockpile that Thatcher was quite able to starve out the miners.

The sensible thing to do would be to have sat down at the negotiating table and discussed how to modernise the industry and minimise the pain involved in closing down mines. The union refused to do this - their insistence on maintaining the status quo even in the face of clear evidence that their bargaining power wasn't that strong (the country was still operating months later) was arguably their undoing.",0,1357854027,null,0,false,0,c7uo08a,t3_16b4wn,t1_c7uo08a,t1_c7umzik,null,1430919968,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I got the light from Home Depot.  I went to their outdoor lighting section and bought one that would be mounted on the front of a house i.e. a porch light.

Then I brought it home and basically tore it apart :)  I removed the hardware that would mount it to the house and then found I could unscrew all the pieces and remove the actual hardware fully.  Then while the glass squares were out I spray painted it blue to match the TARDIS.

Not necessarily - people get suicidal due to being circumcised.

I didn't say the act itself caused psychological damage (though there are people who claim that happens too - I'm not convinced either way), but it's the issues that arise from it - never having a complete or notmal body/body image issues/unable to perform sexually (for physical and psychological reasons)/hatred and unhealthy relationship with parents in later life due to knowing what they did/and plenty more.

You can sit around and say it's harmless all you like, but that is totally in the face of all the people who have actually come to extremely serious harm because of it - it has ruined many peoples entire lives.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"You are basing your entire argument on a multiple logical fallacies, that a specific policy for harm reduction for male circumcision potentially applicable at this time in the UK can be extended without thought or logic onto all other unpleasant things. We might as well also legalize bank robbery and allow citizens to own biological weapons! Might as well ""regulate"" instead of allow criminals to control these things. 

You cannot blindly apply one potential conclusion for this debate across things that have absolutely nothing to do with it. It's like saying 2+2=4 therefore 4+8=4. It makes no sense. 

The argument to currently allow male circumcision in a medial setting in the UK is based on multiple factors. These include a) it's presently legal, b) it's the norm in several cultures within the UK and c) the alternative arguments will lead to worse outcomes. Do you really want families flying to some lawless shithole so a person who's never heard of bacteria can mutilate them with a rusty knife? Because that's what *will* happen with what you are advocating. Male circumcision is very ethnically wrong imho but from a purely medical standpoint it's relatively harmless when done correctly. If just 0.01% of those who would normally have had it done do so in unclean conditions following a ban then you have caused vastly more harm. Having a single child die of an infection is infinitely worse than your moral offence at the practice. This is the reality of the situation and any attempt to evolve humanity past it must be done with this in mind. You cannot just ""ban"" something an expect it to go away.

Yeah, I agree. But we have to be pragmatic. While you and I agree religion is no good reason to cut the tip of someone's willy off, people are going to do it one way or another.

 &gt;Education is an important part of reducing the practice, but from an ethical standpoint I can't agree that it shouldn't be banned because some boys will be damaged.

Agree re: education.

The whole point of making it illegal would be to prevent harm, right? I'm not sure I understand your second point.

&gt;Boys are already having their genitals damaged everyday, even by qualified practitioners - google skin bridge for starters. In any case so far as I know most circumcisions aren't performed by surgeons etc. but religious people. I'm not sure that they sit an exam to hold the position they do.

I'll pass on googling for gorey details. I think anyone cutting up children should be qualified to do so, and *that* is what we need instead of an outright ban: that those who perform circumcisions be people actually qualified to do so. I think that is the best way to reduce harm.

You're not just condoning a small act on the basis of ""it'll be done anyway"" (which isn't even necessarily true) but you're sentencing people to potential life-long problems when you should be fighting the people committing the atrocities.

You are acting as though there are no victims, but there are victims, and they need protecting - they are the most vulnerable, with no voice of their own, and we as a society are insane for letting it happen.

So is having a single child die of an infection worse than a hundred adults committing suicide? How do you weigh out the pros and cons here?

I don't have to, fortunately, because I'm taking a more absolute ethical stance on the issue - I believe that human rights are more important than wishy-washy compromise. Liberty or death, and all that.

But I'm honestly confused at how you can be so certain that your supposed balance is actually balanced at all and not just completely fucked up?

You just stated 0.01% (completely made up without any thought, I'm guessing?) as causing more harm. I call bullshit. 1000 circumcisions on the NHS will almost definitely cause more lasting harm overall than a single 1 carried out otherwise, which even then will most likely go ahead without issue and in fact be just 0.01% of the overall harm caused otherwise.

Also, while I'm not a ""punishing people will make everyone else stop doing bad things"" person - banning circumcision would reduce the practise and could entirely wipe it out for a *very* simple reason:

As for your reality/plausibility/whatever argument:

Circumcision happens for cultural reasons, and within a community people do it because it it expected of them by the rest of that community. That means as long as people are able to engage openly in conversion about it, it will remain an issue. Once it's illegal people aren't going to be shouting from the rooftops that they had their baby circumcised. If they did they likely wouldn't tell/show anyone but their closest trusted friends and family for fear that word will get out/spread, and eventually someone will report them for it.

This effect will *massively* reduce the rate of circumcisions, and by some predictions could turn it from being a mainstream to a fringe issue within a generation.",0,1357856677,null,0,false,0,c7uoyvi,t3_16bhjf,t1_c7uoyvi,t1_c7uoiq6,null,1430920423,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The AAP suggested allowing a pin prick or ritual nick to draw blood, in an attempt to curb parents opting for a different type of FGM (one that involves tissue removal). The reaction was as you might except, given the general opposition to FGM (and rightly so). That AAP's position was (to an extent) analogous to the one you're making here.

&gt; make chants about how moronic Roman is for sacking so many managers

First of all that was done, last night I heard people chanting 'Roman Abramovich is this what you want' as I came out the ground. However you're making a false assumption here, and that is that chanting at matches is primarily used as some kind of campaign tool by the fans. Everyone knows the board doesn't give a fuck about the fans' opinions, chanting f**k of benitez is a way of venting anger, and last night also felt like a bit of an 'I told you so' to the board. Buck was booed at half-time as well.

&gt; Booing Torres...are you fucking kidding me?

The match-going fans supported Torres through thin and thin (there was no thick) in his first one and a half seasons, how has he repayed that? With terrible displays which show no improvement and no effort.  Fans who pay hundreds of pounds a year if not more have the right to be pissed off with his continued involvement, especially when we have a much better replacement on the bench. To be honest I didn't even hear any booing where I was, I only heard rapturous applause for Ba and the prospect of not having to see the pathetic excuse for a football player that is Torres continue to play. 

&gt; Get off your fucking high horse. 

Clearly you don't understand the meaning of this phrase at all, you're the one who has just been on a high horse, preaching to fans that they're behaving wrongly. On a website dominated by people who don't go to matches I might add, so it's somewhat irrelevant.

&gt; Let it fucking go

No. Again, I think you fail to understand the objective of fans. You go on to mention how he'll never come back - the object of the 16th minute thing is not to make Roman bring him back in, that will never happen. It is to show gratitude to a man who is an absolute legend as a player (scored in 2 FA Cup Finals, one of which was our first piece of major silverware in 26 years, and a League Cup Final, which I hope you already knew) and a manager, and was treated terribly by the board/owner. It is also a show of continued discontent at replacing this legend with a poor manager who was universally hated by fans. 

&gt;Booing Rafa?

Ok then, looks like showing any kind of discontent - even after losing twice at home within a week to a midtable and relegation side respectively - is wrong in your eyes. Rafa hasn't earnt our respect, he doesn't deserve our reverence. The only good thing about this appointment is that now at least he now knows that shit he said about Chelsea fans being unpassionate is untrue.

It's horrid, but at the end of the day, fanatically religious people will find a way to make this happen. Girls are flown out to various far flung countries to have circumcisions performed on them (hacking their clitoris off), because it's illegal here. Where there's a will, there's a way. 

The best way to combat this practice is to slowly but surely convince religious people that it's *unnecessary*. Circumcision on Jewish boys is performed because it's ""hygienic"", but we have things like showers now. It's no longer religiously necessary. Still, it's become ingrained in them and they'll do it because it's traditional.

I can see both points, though. A train isn't necessarily unreliable just because it has lots of passengers on it or because it's at 8am rather than at 2pm (although I'm sure there's some nitpicking there). If XYZ TOC Ltd manages to run a train all of the way on time, then that surely counts the same regardless of time of day?

Network Rail presumably doesn't get passenger count (I doubt the TOC is absolutely sure, other than doing periodic counts or by using ticket sales as a rough figure) and the PPM is based entirely on what their systems say the trains are doing.

I guess the best thing to do might be to have two sets of statistics.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"I'm sorry, but you are claiming that someone can't develop body issues due to there *actually being an issue with their body*? And so you made me go looking for links, I came across one:

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/myths-about-circumcision-you-likely-believe

Which actually cites 2 studies backing up the fact that the baby might actually remember or have direct issues stemming from the event, too (Myth 6).

To more directly answer your request for evidence though, try reading some first hand accounts of people who have developed issues which are directly related to circumcision, there are hundreds of them around, scatted across blog posts, forums, articles, etc. There is definitely no pattern of privileged lives or any reason to think they have other mental health issues when their issues solely revolve around their circumcision.

Mental health issues are often *caused* by factors - eg. some people get depressed due to thinking they are too fat (when they aren't) and other people get depressed due to their actual physical state of being morbidly obese and get too depressed because of it to do anything about it. You are basically claiming, for example, that the state of someone's body couldn't possibly be the trigger for depression, and that if that fat person wasn't fat they would still be depressed for some other reason because they must surely have other underlying mental health problems.

I think this is just you not understanding mental health, to put it bluntly. There are many triggers for depression that are actually caused by tangible things. Changing these things can ""cure"" the depression, for good, permanently. But some things such as that surgery you had as a baby can't be changed.

Also, regarding the legal definitions, I'm kind of glad you brought that up because it's an interesting area - circumcision is ""legal"", but as we saw recently in Germany it's technically against German law already, even though it is carried out.

It is actually a violation of extremely basic and well established human rights, but society basically turns a blind eye and has a special little exception for it so as not to upset some people on a large scale.

Basically the world at large has already decided it's wrong and should be illegal, but no one is quite sure what to do about it or how to take the first steps.

This is not true with the abortion issue at all - in fact it's mostly the complete opposite that is true, the right to an abortion is more and more being enshined in law, and there is no human rights convention that should be supposedly protecting those early foetuses.",0,1357858914,null,0,false,0,c7upqoq,t3_16bhjf,t1_c7upqoq,t1_c7up72f,null,1430920787,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And you aren't helping. You literally label them ""mutilated"" and a victim of an ""atrocity""!

It is partly the making of this as a huge issue that causes any of harm you mention. You are conditioning people into this response by treating them as freaks. If it were seen as normal then the issues evaporate. How does that work? 

You do realise that most American males are circumcised? FWIW a friend of mine is, through a genuine medical need when he was a teenager. Is he also a victim of an ""atrocity""? Should he be feeling these same ""body image issues""? If not, why not? 

&gt; You just stated 0.01% (completely made up without any thought, I'm guessing?)

Of course it was, the preamble was ""if even just""! Why do you even ask this?

&gt;  1000 circumcisions on the NHS will almost definitely cause more lasting harm overall than a single 1 carried out otherwise

Where is the evidence of harm from circumcision? Note I do not support or condone the practice, in fact I've argued against it many times to girls who have said they like it &amp; have swayed several opinions in this regard. This doesn't mean I can't be rational on the issue though. 

If what you say is true I'd expect to see a massive increase in suicides in the USA.

&gt; Once it's illegal people aren't going to be shouting from the rooftops that they had their baby circumcised. 

No, they'll do it quietly in the same way various people I know offer illicit substances. Personally I think your reasoning is very naive, illegal drugs require either complex manufacture or importation yet they are rife. Circumcision takes a knife. Trying to ban it at this time is beyond crazy imho. 

Instead, educate people into not wanting it but for fucks sake don't label them freaks while you're at it! You could even be sneaky and use a white-lie to argue that ""it's no longer necessary in the modern age"" and sway people without making them look like Neanderthals. Your approach helps no one.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"You should say ethics really, not morality.. morals are far more subjective, and based for example on religions... whereas ethics is generally a bit more absolute.

But eh, this is unfortunately an argument that will go nowhere - there's no way to have a non-arbitrary cut-off point when a foetus can and cannot be killed, or even post-birth abortions for that matter. We've only come to the stage we have based on sensations of pain and other developmental markers, but I would agree it makes no sense that a foetus at x weeks gets more legal protection than a non-human animal that is fully developed and more conscious, too!

However I don't see how this argument is either here or there, because we have the draw the lines on what is and isn't allowed somewhere in order to have a functional society. And we have actually drawn the line that early abortions are legal, and circumcision is not quite so legal - but happens anyway.

Just to expand a little further on what I mean - chopping off a little toe would do less harm, yet you'd probably go to prison for doing that to a baby because it's illegal. Circumcision gets a free pass as a very specific act of mutilating a baby's body even though a million other acts of mutilation less harmful are all now allowed just because we are basically unsure how to go about stopping it - it's like the elephant in the room that everyone is talking about, except for that part about how to get rid of the elephant because the door is too small because the elephant got into the room when it was a baby, a few thousand years ago, and now we're not sure what the fuck... to expand an analogy way past reason :P

But hey, what I want to ask again here - are you *really* all for a parents right to do a million other acts of mutilation on their baby *too*, or are you *only* pro-circumcision?

The second article above is for instance talking specifically about commuter services into London compared with other cities, not about the wider network.

I managed to find an academic comparison between the train services in Germany, Sweden and the UK [here](http://www.transguide.org/SWoPEc/CTS2011-19.pdf), which has some quite interesting data:

* On page 13, they give comparative fare prices per km, in Euro cents:


                    Long Distance     Regional
          Britain        10.7           8.1
          Sweden         10.8           11.7
          Germany        9.9            7.6
Britain has approximately comparable fares to Germany, and somewhat lower fares than Sweden (which you'd expect given Sweden's population density).

* On page 11, they give taxpayer subsidy per passenger km, in Euro cents:

          Britain        0.10           
          Sweden         0.18        
          Germany        0.12       
So Britain has the lowest subsidy of the three nations.

* On page 9, there's data for taxpayer subsidy, which shows a very significant increase in Britain from 1997-2007, more than 250% over that period, which is quite shocking. But it seems that the increase has come from extra spending on improving the infrastructure, from £1500m in 1997 to £3800m in 2007, whereas the remaining 'support to services' has decreased from £700m to £600m. So the increase could be because the infrastructure was not being upgraded when it was being run publicly, under previous conservative governments.

* On page 14, they give fare increase rates 1997-2007:

                               Sweden, Britain, Germany,

        Inflation (CPI)         3.1      3.8       1.5
        Local public transport  5.5      4.2       3.9
        Long distance rail      3.2      6.6       2.4
Long distance fares have grown more quickly in Britain, but from above, they have basically just grown to parity with other European services. And local services are growing more slowly than in both other countries,  taking inflation into account.

* Also on page 14, they give growth rates for how much people are using rail, over the period from 1997-2007. British use of rail increased at the fastest rate, at 3.5% a year, then Sweden at 2.6%, and Germany far lower at 0.9%. That means that British use of rail increased 40% over that period, which is impressive. Although they say that's unlikely to have anything to do with privatization.

So, according to this paper, the British service is rather good, certainly roughly comparable with Germany and Sweden. Assuming I read the data correctly, anyway. Also, to head off any element of bias, read the abstract; the paper is not generally in favour of the privatization approach, and says that the British programme of breaking up the service has not yielded better results than Germany sticking with its more 'vertically orientated' approach (meaning a more unified, monolithic public rail organization).",0,1357860032,null,0,false,0,c7uq44m,t3_16bvtu,t1_c7uq44m,t3_16bvtu,null,1430920964,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"*sigh* I'm not sure I want to respond to this in full, so forgive me for responding to the highlights. The above makes some valid points and some less than valid points based on incorrect assumptions. I really don't like /r/unitedkingdom turning into /r/ukpolitics though, so forgive me if I don't respond to comments etc.

&gt; The background IS important, because it’s hypocritical of people who got free education, healthcare, welfare, apprenticeships, jobs for life and all the benefits of a socialised society to deny those to other people.

This is both right and wrong. It's right that background is important, but it's more geographic than anything in the UK (which is much the same as elsewhere). Every country in the world has wealth clusters (as far as I know there is no country that has even geographical distribution of wealth) and spaces where wealth is lacking. I was born in one where wealth was lacking and live in an area where there's a cluster.

To say that it's hypocritical that some of the best educated people in the country are able to deny those things to other people is somewhat disingenuous in my opinion. To suggest that to be able to deny those things to other people if the high point of your previous career was folding towels much less so, but bear in mind that Gordon Brown was a fully qualified economist, and look where he got us, not that I'm defending Osborne in the slightest.

&gt; Capitalism rewards winners, but to have winners you must, logically, have losers.

This only applies if you see capitalism as a zero-sum game. If you're anti-capitalist, then I would suggest that you're more likely to do so. If you're pro-capitalist then I would suggest that you're less likely to do so. My own personal view is that social safeguards and economic growth both do their bit to ensure that it isn't a zero-sum game, but the destruction of one can affect the other.

&gt; I would also argue that it’s economically idiotic to reduce benefots. It won’t cause jobs to be created, it will just suck money out of the real economy.

Aside from the lack of definition of the real economy (as opposed to an imaginary economy) it's not economically idiotic to reduce benefits. It's economically idiotic to reduce benefits in a way that reduce social mobility or affect those that need them the most. The big problem in the past 30-odd years or more hasn't been the number of benefit claimants, it falls back to geography and generations of people on benefits caught in a benefit trap. There's a difference between cutting bloat, austerity and unnecessary pain. I'm not convinced the tories understand unnecessary pain regardless of inflicting it, but there is a case to be heard that benefit reform is a necessary part of restructuring government spending provided that those that need help the most are not affected. Make it viable for people to work instead of claiming benefits and boost the creation of small businesses and that's how you'll grow the economy (protip - big companies don't need to hire new people and a more concerned with cost reduction in a recession, small companies grow and need to hire new people before a percentage become big).

I read the rest of this and lost the will to live mainly. There are some good points, such as the 10% tax - I'm not sure I agree on the numbers but a windfall tax could be good providing we qualify unused money. I would also agree that taxing the poor is utterly stupid and it makes more sense (both for the poor and for employers) to raise minimum tax thresholds to a point where people can be paid a reasonable basic living wage without taxation to end the benefit trap, as long as people are given serious support to start their own businesses, as that's how the economy will grow (at least in my blinkered view).

I think the education would increase the time a child is taught, which means theorectically they should be smarter and have more independent time with a teacher. It also helps parents who work but can't afford child care.

More CCTV cameras might be an unpopular opinion, but it deters some crime and gives evidence. I believe they should be strictly controlled by the regions police force, who'd employ CCTV operators on a predetermined budget.

Or worse: ""And Leeds have lost possession of the ball.""

So many times, our player in an advanced position on the wing will just give the ball away for free. The vast majority of our players are liable to just have the ball nicked off them. The only players who don't have this trait are Diouf and McCormack. Byram too, although he's been guilty of it in recently games.

Agreed about McCormack. He's just wasted out wide, when he could be doing what he did against Blackburn instead, for example. However, I must say that I'd rather have McCormack on the wing, with Tonge and Austin in the middle, than Tonge on the wing with Austin and Norris in the middle. Reverting to playing out wide Tonge now would be a huge step backwards for the club.

The last time I felt confident in a Leeds United defence was in the first couple of months of our League One promotion season. Kisnorbo in particular was absolutely immense. The ball would go in from a set piece, and I'd just know that they would clear it. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case for a long while now (although we aren't so bad at set pieces; it's high tempo open play where we tend to crumble). Right now, in his form since the Millwall game, I'd definitely say that Lees has been the best in-form defender since Kisnorbo in 09/10 and it's really harsh for him to have been dropped just like that.

I've been really impressed by Byram, too. Especially with how he did so admirably well against the likes of Zaha - although he seemed to get caught out in recent games against the slow feet but quick mind of players like Reid at Forest.

As it currently stands, the majority of housing benefit goes towards paying rent to a private landlord at rates that are solely decided by those landlords.

We're ultimately paying £15 billion a year into mostly private hands for pretty much zero net benefit.

We would have been much better off signing a striker in the summer, thus not relying on a misfiring, and now quite frankly useless looking forward with absolutely no squad depth at the position.

That said, when he was sacked, our league position was fine. Now its plummeting, we are walking a tight line to being knocked out of a cup that we should have breezed through considering the teams in the semi-final (no discredit to Swansea, I think they are an awesome team, but one we should have NO issues dispatching at the Bridge). Our home field apparently is no longer a fortress that teams fear to play in, and Benitez-chosen squads have failed to score in 4 of 6 home matches.

I think you are taking some of our fans criticism of the team as something of poor taste and bad judgement, where in fact it proves just how dedicated we are to this team. We are UNHAPPY with how things are going, we have a manager that not a single one of us would have hired, who is making mind-boggling team selections and substitutions and skirting by because every now and then we win by more than 3 goals, making people forget that we drew Fulham, lost to West Ham, lost to QPR, and now, lost to Swansea. Our anger at our striker, who costs us nearly 1million GBP PER MONTH to employ, is more than warranted, not because he doesn't score, but because he looks ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED IN PLAYING. There is no fire there, he sulks worse than Anelka ever did.

The statistic that's usually ignored during the discussions is the fact that railway footfall is continually rising. This implies that there are enough people willing to pay for rail fares at their rising prices and the principal of supply and demand would indicate that there is nothing wrong with this. However, the reaction from the general public implies the opposite.

The main issue I've found with railways is that of leisure versus commuter travel. As it is, commuters are locked into a deal, so companies can be harsher with the fares and still get customers. I also wonder how much companies will attempt to ""price out"" customers so that the demand for train travels does not exceed capacity.

I'm a leisure traveller, and have way more freedom of transport choice. So train companies have to persuade me to travel. So I've had fantastic value tickets in the past like Oxford-&gt;London, £4 single and Winsford -&gt; Runcorn (about 10 miles), £2 return. I wonder sometimes how much companies could afford to drop peak tickets if they charged a more flat rate on tickets.

true,Draxton,null,null,"&gt;You know what that's what parents do, children don't have choices. They aren't developed enough to make choices. 

Yes, but none of the choices you listed are irrevocable. The child is not *permanently altered* by having chips for dinner instead of pasta. It's not a piercing you can just take out. So, again, would you be happy right now for someone to alter your body without your consent? I wouldn't, I don't understand why anyone would to be honest. The choice to change their body can be made as an adult, in a way that the examples you listed cannot. There is no harm to the child (except in medical emergencies) with waiting to be circumcised.

&gt;What if at 18, 100% of these children now want circumcisions due to their religious choice, but the risk factors are now so great and the cost so much greater they cant have them or afford them.

So what? They won't drop dead from a lack of cultural circumcision, so why is it the State's responsibility to help them? The choice is there for them as adults to be circumcised. That they cannot afford it is irrelevant. Why would the State sponsor it if it's a religious thing? Will the State be paying for baptisms now? Bar mitzvahs? As for the ""risk"" factor, [citation needed]. Everything I've read says adult circumcision is less risk due to the penis being fully formed. 

&gt;Who are you to deny people their religious rights?

Me? No-one. But the law is important. Again, does the right of the child not supercede the right of religious freedom? My earlier example, if I founded a religion with ""cutting the little finger"", would you expect my right to religious freedom to protect me from laws on mutilation and assault? I'd hope not, because the separation of Church/Mosque/Temple and State is important to the law of a multicultural (and multi-faith!) society. Christian's have the ""right"" to stone people who work on the Sabbath, based on the teachings of the Bible. But the law of the land says that'd be murder. So, Christians have been denied their religious right to stone people. Is anyone going to argue that's wrong?

Umm? This just reads like a rant, not a calm, thought out repose. I think that circumcision is harmful physically and psychologically to the child. I think that ""religion"" is not a reasonable excuse for the disfigurement of another human being (regardless of age). I think that a person should be free to make their own choices on their body and that a parent does not have the right to fundamentally alter their child's body. If protecting children's rights means ancient religious 'traditions' must suffer, so be it. Tradition is not a good enough reason to continue an immoral practice.

I'm not sure why you think this is ""about me"". My parents did not believe in circumcision, my children will be free to make their own choices when they're older. 

&gt;youre not prepared to listen to the people it will effect or consider the impact on their community, its about winning and youre so convinced everything other than your view is noise.

It's not ""noise"", but I find it difficult to sympathise with people who want to chop bits of their children off for no reason but ""faith"". If that makes me a bad person, well I'll just have to accept that? You have failed to present any viewpoints, evidence or...well anything about these ""impacts"". So, what impacts? 

&gt;Where does it stop, halal and kosher food? Sterilization programs for junkies, fat people, poor people, criminals, people below a certain intellect quotient. Aren't these all valid programs to undertake once youve sorted the foreskin problem.

Not sure what point you're making? If you could draw the link between the argument on circumcision and that of whether we should ""sterilize junkies"" (with relevant scientific studies), I'll be happy to respond. Until then, I'm a little confused at what parallels you're making.

&gt;Its not about the children because you arent considering the impact on those who would want this done.

The parents? I don't believe the parents wishes have more moral weight than the child's rights to an unaltered body. You have still failed to answer the question I posed earlier: would you, as a grown human being, be happy for someone to change you without your consent? It feels like you're dodging it now.

It completely is. Sure you may just be stating that things have improved, but you're using that in support of private companies as opposed to national ones. Perhaps you may not have any personal preference over private and public services, but to essentially say ""things got better in a privately run company since they were privatized"" is biased.

&gt; Claims you, without any evidence to back up the claim.

No, its common sense. In the 80s there were regular blackouts/brownouts, would we still be encountering those today if electricity was still a public service? Probably not. Privatization was just an excuse for profiteering.

Then huh, seasons of the writing attempting to keep peoples attention by never really saying for sure who she likes.  Followed immediately by their love being unbreakable and spanning the ages.  Load of crap.  And that's to say nothing of her ineptitude as a companion.  Now here, I have to admit, the writers took worthless to a new level.  In most of the history of the show the doctor found (and sometimes caused) a problem.  He and his companion then would apply some form of critical thinking and solve it.  Now they just seem to more or less run around letting the problems sort themselves out.  Pond is just a poor character on a show who's writing has unfortunately declined.  It has seen bad times before, I'm just hoping it goes back on an upswing.  Combine all of this with the writer simply changing major attributes of some of the antagonists just to force a sub par plot line to work, and u get an all around useless companion.

**what went down**

Both sides were curious to what each subreddit was planning on using so of course both sides were monitoring each others posts.

From the comments on both subreddits, Its appears that the United subreddit had quickly amassed a number of posts that (a lot of you and even some of them) considered to be pushing that limit of banter/funny and just plain offensive. There was unfortunately a few submitters that posted things and had no intent of being funny and were just posted to offend, so of course a lot of LFC members saw these posts and retaliated with downvotes until their mod rightfully removed them (after a while). 

Its important to mention that once some fans had seen the Hillsborough and KKK posts a lot of members opted out entirely rather than consider any other options, they felt the line had been crossed and lost any interest in a bet 

Now *some* of the semi-offensive/pushing it posts on RedDevils were up there for quite some time, which meant a lot of members here saw what they were suggesting. From our comments it seems to suggest a lot of members felt that they were getting a bit out of hand and this banner bet would get ugly so a lot of members opted to reject the proposal.

The RedDevils mod thanked us for considering his proposal and left..

**how the situation didnt improve..**

Back at the Uniteds subreddit myho (the United mod) proceeded to tell the members that we declined the offer.. [but felt the need to add that we 'cried like babies over this one'](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/16bsmr/sidebar_picture_bet_with_rliverpoolfc/c7uniyz) in an attempt to impress die hard united supporters.

severedfragile immediately set the record straight by [telling them how we really reacted and our justifiable reasons for declining their offer](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/16bsmr/sidebar_picture_bet_with_rliverpoolfc/c7up25l)

By now LFC members had seen that the united mod had tried to turn this on us and got downvoted..[he didnt help the situation by calling us 'LooserpoolFC'](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/16bsmr/sidebar_picture_bet_with_rliverpoolfc/c7unop6)

[United fans reacted by downing on our suggestion page and the members here reacted by downvoting there, ugly back and forth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/16bsmr/sidebar_picture_bet_with_rliverpoolfc/c7uq5b6)

This was not a case of just our members simply downvoting random united fans for the sake of it, but rather they downvoted those who believed the false info and comments of myho and those who then proceeded to say insulting comments about our members and LFC. 

------------

What the fans should do is cheer his name to no end so that he thinks, ""Fuck, I gotta work at 200% to give back to them."" but instead they're booing him and he's gotta think, ""Fuck this, why am I even trying for these assholes if they boo me?"" 

Look at the Swansea fans at the last game we played against them. They were down 1-0 and all they did is cheer even harder and louder. And they're not even in the the top 5(they're 9th right now). That's what fans should do, they shouldn't be pricky little shits and boo, you boo the opposition, not the team you're supporting. 

I dislike Rafa as much as the next guy and I wouldn't mind if Chelsea sold Torres but booing your own team is just not right. ",1,1357878644,null,0,false,0,c7uvsa4,t3_16c39g,t1_c7uvsa4,t1_c7uo6xu,null,1435646999,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1

A lot of suggested ""literature based"" episodes that I see floating around the internet forget that the Doctor lives in (obviously an alternate, fictionalized version of) our world, and so stories and books which are just stories in our world are fictional stories in the DW universe as well (the most notable example being Sherlock Holmes; this being Moffat's explanation for why there will never be a proper Sherlock/Doctor Who crossover). However, there have been ""literature based"" episodes where events happen which allude to ""real-world"" fiction by means of extraterrestrial intervention (the two most clear examples being the two Xmas specials ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe""). This idea is very reminiscent of ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe"" in fact. Very cool though.

2) This is not a training school. This is an international department in a Chinese school. There is no ""promotion"" work, but there will be some events outside of normal school hours such as parent teacher meetings. 

In China sometimes school days are moved to weekends in order to create longer holidays, other than that the working days will be 5 days a week. Teachers will teach a maximum of 25 45min classes a week, you will be teaching the same students at the same time week by week. The school day is divided into two with a long lunch break in the middle, there are 4 morning classes and 4 afternoon classes. Teachers will be expected to work office hours so that they can prepare classes communicate with colleagues and help students. 

3) Absolutely not.

4) If an applicant is successful we will pay for the initial flight to china, on completion of an 11 month contract a flight bonus will be paid representing a return flight.

5) There is a lot of support here for our teachers, there will be around 6 foreign teachers working in the department, we pay a good salary with good benefits. Staff retention is important to us and hopefully we can work with you to ensure a smooth transition to living and working in China. We ask our staff to provide 2 months notice for termination of contract.

6)This is teaching in 1 school.

&gt;Its not a .gov.eu website or .gov.uk.

&gt;Anybody could have made that website. The numbers could also be skewed to be lower, hence more pro-EU.

Ok then.

[This](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/revexp/revenue_and_expenditure_files/data/revenue_and_expenditure_en.xls) is directly from the EU commission:

Total paid to the EU: 13,825.2 million [cell 86AJ]

Total expenditure in UK: -5,565.6 million [cell 95AJ]

Net contribution to EU: €8,259.6 million per year = €22.63 million per day = **£18.58 million per day**.

There's a discrepancy between the two sources (which is explained on the money-go-round [methodology page](http://www.money-go-round.eu/Section.aspx?id=2)) but that's only ~£380 thousand a day, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the difference between Farage's assertion and the actual amount spent.

If Farage's figure of £53 million per day was correct, that would be €23,563.95 million per year (a **€15,304.35 million difference**!). Even if he was talking about the total paid to the EU before deduction of EU expenditure in the UK, there's still a **€9,738.75 million** difference!

**tl;dr: The official figures prove Farage wrong, by approximately *ten to fifteen billion* euros a year**

&gt;Ill believe Farage saying that live among people in the know who would see a reason to pull him up on that.

Most MEPs know Farage is a joke. I wouldn't be surprised if they just simply ignored him rather than correct his wilfully incorrect figures. Parliamentary procedure in the European Parliament isn't like that in Westminster and there's a lot fewer opportunities to rebut statements like that.

Surely the campaign and protests, all things being equal, to return the flag should seek to have the union flag flown over all civic buildings in the UK throughout the year?

Secondly there is the operational aspect in terms of refuelling and refit. It's pretty standard that after 5-6 years of service a nuclear vessel needs to be refuelled. This is no simple matter, the French carrier will be out of action for 3 years while its being refuelled.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"i think bascombe has missed the mark a bit. all managers are pragmatic in their own way, they all want to win the next game. they just have different opinions on the best way to do this. hodgson thought the best way to win games was by having 2 banks of four and hoping to regain the ball with the opposition out of position and counter attack quickly. brendan thinks the best way is to have most of the possession and to open teams up with passing and movement. both are ""philosophies"", neither is right or wrong (although hodgson's was awful to watch).

My problems with hodgson were:

The style of play wasn't working and there was no sign of progress at all. Most matches even against poor teams were scrappy, if things had gone against us with refereeing or woodwork-hitting as they did this season or in 11-12 we realistically could have been right in the relegation scrap. We might have had 25 points or whatever but it felt like we could easily have had less with a bit of bad luck.

His behaviour wasn't befitting of a liverpool manager. Pandering to Ferguson, shifting blame onto the players, criticising the anti-Hicks/Gillette protests. 


Some interesting things about brendan:

If we really do focus just on attacking in practice it might explain why we're such a mess at times out of possession. Especially following set pieces (mansfield goal, sunderland chances) where we're completely disorganised. I'd be surprised if brendan didn't see this as a problem though.

Someone, Dion Fanning I think, criticised Brendan for being too positive after victories. The shots on target story ahows that Brendan is doing things right - back the players in public but demand high standards in private.

It was playful fun, we mocked them and they took it like gents, and we would have done the same if we had lost (mind you this was a big controversial game too). And within 20 minutes of coming up with the suggestion with you guys, it was obvious it wouldn't work. 

I'm not generalizing your fans, but /r/soccer and team subreddit users as a whole. I've been around for almost 3 years now, before team subreddits even existed, and everyone got along great and I learned more than I ever have about various teams around the world. Now we're basically like any other forum that has divided into our own team subreddits. Today showed me we are no longer one large community as redditors that united us, but it's all about supporting your individual team now and that's fine, which is why /r/soccer doesn't really work any longer. I'm done trying to keep us all getting along because it's obvious we're past that. No passive-aggressive tone, I'm just accepting that's how it is now. And it's not just based on size, because the other sports subreddits are still great and have playful fun and banter. 

Nothing against you guys because I know you're just as passionate as we are for our team. But it's a complete us vs you mentality now days in team subreddits, hence the linking to each other's posts and the ""Look what this guy said over in ___"". We do have a lot of civil and level-headed posters in our subreddit as well, but obviously the ones pointed out are the immature ones. The KKK and Hillsborough posters were downvoted heavily within 15 minutes of the post (by red devils too), but it was instantly ""Look at what they posted and is their top post and they're all scum and I hate Mancs"". And not saying we don't do the same either, but it just shows that uniting everyone as a community of redditors is impossible because we're all armies for our own team now.

The reason I don't think it's as simple is not because of any special knowledge, but because I don't think it makes much sense. I think it's far more likely that:

 - Unions had become so powerful that British companies couldn't change. Which meant if they needed to change to become more competitive (eg. introduce mechanisation, change a few jobs) they couldn't - the union would have all the staff on a picket line before the management could even finish explaining what they wanted to do.
 - Thatcher would have known full well that there were plenty of areas in the country with only one or two significant employers and those were industrial rather than service based. She'd therefore have known that policies which destroyed them would have a significant impact on those areas.
 - Problem: It was already painfully obvious that many of those industries desperately needed to modernise or they'd collapse. Sure, Thatcher could have enacted policies that pandered to them, but it would only have meant delaying the inevitable.
 - Solution: Enact policies that attract some other sort of business. They may have a negative effect on the Industrial North, but those industries will have to adapt or die. Which, frankly, they're going to have to do sooner or later anyway.
   - Why do I not think Thatcher intended to destroy manufacturing? Because she failed. There's plenty of cars being manufactured in this country today, for instance, but few of them in British-owned plants. Honda and BMW both have UK plants.
 - With decent labour relations, this could have been explained and there could have been sensible discussions about how to save those industries. But, as you say, we don't really have that in this country. We have a very adversarial system, which means any suggestion by management is invariably seen as meaning fewer jobs, therefore bad, therefore must be stopped at all costs - even if one of those costs is ""your employer will have to declare bankruptcy"".",0,1357894209,null,0,false,0,c7uz6px,t3_16b4wn,t1_c7uz6px,t1_c7uom9p,null,1430925341,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"I see what you mean. I became less cold through acting. Once I realised that I was different, and somewhat emotionally ""stunted"", for the term I used to use, I decided that if I wanted anything in life, success, partners, friends of any sort, that I'd have to be someone worth being around. It took a few years of learning how to act, around 5, but I reached a healthy point. 

The methodology was hard and relied heavily on circumstances. The key step was to find people who are well liked, and to deduce which traits that they exhibit that gain the most attention and positive feedback. I don't need to adopt a flawed personality. It was also important to discover my own negatives and remove them. This is something that you can do with or without empathy, but I had to if I wanted to attain my goals. 

To get to that point I had to find people who were well liked and would spend a large amount of time with me unconditionally. Thankfully the traits that tend to lead to one being well liked tend to be the ones that allow people to accept somebody who isn't exactly very fun into their near-inner circles. Of course that's a trait I didn't adopt, it leads to a depressing entourage. 

Thankfully at the time of this realisation I moved to university and had the opportunity to throw my old identity in the bin. So I did. It was a complete reinvention. I identified people of high calibre and began to study them. I would spend a large amount of social time just watching, learning, and determining how people worked. Having a lack of empathy made some social interaction harder, so I had to learn how it went. I also had some social ineptness from my lack of past positive social experiences that I had to remove.

A year later and a complete rewrite of who I was, I left that year a new person. Things weren't so straightforwards from there due to a change in circumstances (no halls), but I had the groundwork laid down for me at that point, so further improvement wasn't difficult. 

I'm now at the point I wanted to be at. I easily make friends, I'm attractive, girls, and guys, fall for me pretty easily, I dress well, I impress, I'm on my way to being successful. I don't feel like I'm missing out on much with regards to empathy. By this point in my life, almost everybody who used to know me says I am not the person they used to know at all, the only thing that was consistent was my height and my interests, and even then I had gained a massive range of new interests.

A Cochrane meta-analysis of studies done on sexually active men in Africa found that circumcision reduces the infection rate of HIV among heterosexual men by 38–66% over a period of 24 months,[7] and studies have concluded it is cost-effective against HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.[8] Circumcision reduces the incidence of HSV-2 infections by 28%,[9] and is associated with reduced HPV prevalence[a] and a reduced risk of both UTIs and penile cancer.[5] Studies of its protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been inconclusive. A review of literature worldwide found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a median complication rate of 1.5% for newborns and 6% for older children, with few severe complications.

The thing about Pubs was that it is actually part of the licensing law that publicans are not allowed to serve alcohol to people who are drunk.

So what you have there, if it was enforced, is an on-site regulator. So my proposal would be to substantially reduce the tax on beers and lagers around 3.6% (possibly offset by a raise on stronger drinks). Do something about the ridiculous prices tenants have to pay to brewery landlords for the site and stock and enforce the licensing laws as they stand (no pussyfooting, publicans breaking the law lose their license).

You haven't read either of the links I just provided questioning the effectiveness of MCC in Africa either I take it - have a google, there are lots more. Like I said, my ears get dirty but I don't cut 'em off as a solution.

&gt;why didn't you answer my question about supporting circumcision in Africa?

Because you haven't explained the difference between environment and social aspects. You may as well say 'Eskimos build igloos, therefore why don't we' if you're going to assert that environment is irrelevant to your location. And (again) the benefits in Africa have been questioned more than once - those two links are just the, er, tip.


&gt;your analogies are terrible, as I'm sure you realised when you wrote them.

Nope, they're spot on - you're just ignoring the parallel.

&gt;circumcision removes an unnecessary flap of skin on the penis, I hope you can tell that from your ears. 

Define 'unecessary'. Are you suggesting that without the external parts of your ears, you can't hear anything?

&gt;But I think parents should be able to circumcise their kids just as they can decide to vaccinate them.

Vaccination is leagues apart from MCC. The benefits are vastly superior, and associating the two is not really accurate.

&gt;anyone who's experienced an infection or STD and had to have a circumcision later in life would see the benefits, beside the preventative measures it provides.

How many people have had STD's that have subsequently had to undergo this? I'm sure many people who have had breast cancer would say the same about mastectomies.

Enforce far tougher regulations on these companies too, so (x)% of their profits MUST go to improvement to their services etc.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; You haven't read either of the links I just provided questioning the effectiveness of MCC in Africa either I take it - have a google, there are lots more.

have a google for the studies on the benefits, there are loads more. 

&gt; Define 'unecessary'. Are you suggesting that without the external parts of your ears, you can't hear anything?

without the external part of your ears, your hearing is impaired. what exactly is impaired with the removal of the foreskin? 

&gt; Vaccination is leagues apart from MCC. The benefits are vastly superior, and associating the two is not really accurate.

right, but associating an ear or breast with a foreskin is. 

&gt; How many people have had STD's that have subsequently had to undergo this? I'm sure many people who have had breast cancer would say the same about mastectomies.

yes, because breast=foreskin. 

terrible analogies aside, I'm not really interested in persuading you that circumcision is of undeniable medical benefit. I'm not sure I believe that myself. All I believe is that there is a clear case that *can* be made, and anti-circumcision guys make a massive deal out of what pro-circumcision guys regard as a minor but helpful medical procedure.

The statistical 'higher risks' that are given aren't bourne out in countries like the UK where circumcision is relatively non-existent - why *don't* we have a matching higher rate of penile cancer? What could UK men be doing that stops this being the case?

&gt;without the external part of your ears, your hearing is impaired. what exactly is impaired with the removal of the foreskin? 

But your ears will still work. Just like removing sensitivity and a certain level of protection from your penis - if you're going to use this sort of logic on the latter, why is the former so different?

&gt;right, but associating an ear or breast with a foreskin is. 

Only if you assert that the foreskin is pointless - which isn't really your call to make for anyone's foreskin except your own. But you go right ahead and associate your MCC/ Vaccination connection with my querying why the chop-it-off logic doesn't equally apply (and give similar benefits) to other parts of the body.

&gt;yes, because breast=foreskin. 

You're the one subscribing to preventative logic. I'm just illustrating how that doesn't really work.

&gt;anti-circumcision guys make a massive deal out of what pro-circumcision guys regard as a minor but helpful medical procedure. 

One of these groups is advocating mutilation on infants for their own reasons - the other is asking for proof beforehand.

However the law does state that two doctors must reach the decision to abort in good faith, so if someone presents the reason for abortion being the sex of the child then it poses legal issues, although not insurmountable ones.

And that enthusiasm was compounded by working for his godfather Tim Rathbone, a Tory MP, in the House of Commons during the university holidays. Rathbone's political personality, incidentally, sheds a good deal of light on Cameron's ""noblesse oblige, richesse doesn't"" background. He was as far from being a Thatcherite as a Tory MP could have been, and numbered the ANC's Oliver Tambo among his friends. If Cameron calls himself a ""One Nation"" Tory, the chances are he has Tim Rathbone in mind. Tim Rathbone, one imagines, might have been an outrider in any talks with the Liberal Democrats.

&gt;In hindsight, Cameron's progress from Oxford to the Conservative Research Department looks like a pre-ordained next step up the Tory hierarchy, but the truth is that he couldn't find a job elsewhere. He applied to various banks, in the hope of making some money before trying his hand at Westminster, but he was turned down. So he joined the CRD, where he teamed up with his intellectual sidekick Steve Hilton and Hilton's (now) wife Rachel Whetstone. - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/born-to-rule-the-charmed-life-of-a-class-act-1971394.html

It is a symbol, for a journey that they're not too happy with. A step too far along a road they do not want and do not like.

For centuries this community has been in a position of social advantage and privilege, primarily marked in contrast against the disadvantaged and oppressed catholic majority (possibly a little biased here). They had all the political power, and the few minor experiments with democracy in Ireland were always derailed by them and their interests because it always resulted in the erosion of their hegemony.

Until the signing of the GFA, that is, which enjoyed majority support here and massive support in the rest of the UK (mostly in a ""can you guys stfu and behave now? way"" Now we're something approximating a democracy and that means that at times they see decisions being made that they disagree with. Decisions that erode the traditional privileges they've enjoyed, especially ones they've enjoyed rubbing in the noses of the catholic population here, like the parades. This flag issue is acting as a symbol for what they see as a journey away from their view of Northern Ireland and the UK. No one really gives a flying fuck about the flag, what they care about is the journey.

They're not even wrong, NI is changing away from their view of how it should be. Their traditional response to these issues has been appealing to the UK government or violently oppressing the catholic population into capitulating through the army, RUC and their paramilitaries. They've lost the support of the army, RUC and UK government, now, as all three are endorsing the GFA and subsequent political processes. Some of them see this as being due to treason on the part of the UK government, betraying them and leaving them at the mercy of a creeping Irish nationalism that is moving the country more and more towards Ireland, and away from the UK. Again this is not entirely untrue, but it is merely a reflection of democracy rather than conspiracy or treason.

I can see a signature on the EU treaties for the United Kingdom, which would still continue existing, but Scotland would be independent from the UK.  Nothing to do with the Tories.  

The name Scotland would have to appear on an EU treaty.  That's not an opinion, that's a fact, and there's plenty of precedent for how that comes about.  That there's even any question around this is testimony to the style of campaign Salmond is running.  He even got to pick his own judge when on the stand for claiming he'd taken EU legal advice, which it later transpired, on this matter, he had not.

The House of Lords decided he wasn't to be trusted and went to the European Commission and asked themselves what the actual legal position would be because of the sheer fantasy and wishful thinking coming out of the SNP.  The Commission got back to the House of Lords with their legal advice:

&gt;Moffat has stated that the seventh series will be the opposite of the arc-driven nature of the sixth, consisting of mainly stand-alone stories. This was inspired by fan reactions to the title of ""Let's Kill Hitler"" when it was revealed at the end of ""A Good Man Goes to War"" with no plot details; he told the writers of the seventh series to ""sl*t it up"" with ""big, huge, mad ideas"" and ""write it like a movie poster""

That is what did it for me. That is the exact opposite reason that I love the show. I could overlook some things before Series 7, like people suddenly not ever having seen an alien before during ""The 11th Hour"", even though the world had just recently been dragged across the universe during The End of Time, but when ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" aired, I could barely watch it. Jumpy editing, virtually no plot other than ""DINOSAURS ON A SPACESHIP""... Moffat wrote ""Blink"", ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances""... Those episodes were spectacular. At some point along the way he lost sight of what made the show great, at least in my opinion.

However, I have high hopes for Clara. I absolutely loved the newly aired Christmas Special, and am hoping Moffat's gotten back on his feet, and will hopefully abandon this arc-less ""mad"" writing he's been subjecting me to for the first half of Series 7.

edit: Doctor Who should be about story telling. Not limiting yourself to single episodes (notice the complete lack of two-part episodes in Series 7?) and relying on Amy Pond (or equivalent) hitting the right button by accident.

true,zenmn,null,null,"&gt;The Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland doesn't have direct power over Belfast City Council and Council level decisions, so why fly it?

Wut? Probably because Belfast CC is a localised section of the UK government? It makes sense to fly the Union flag on a UK governmental building (and I agree to keeping it's presence in line with the rest of the UK). Decisions in Westminister can directly affect decisions in BCC, so that part of your argument is a bit silly.

Fair enough that you don't identify as British, the flag issue shouldn't really be a case of trying to force you to identify as a certain nationality (as much as either side seems to think it should). It should be about simply normalising the country into the rest of a UK standard and embracing the fact that this country also includes a vast range of nationalities and ethnic groups. I wouldn't expect a polish immigrant to identify as either British or Irish, or I wouldn't expect the son of and Irish immigrant born in OZ to identify as Australian, yet he has the birthright to be so. Heritage and Locale are not entwined, nor are they exclusive, but are wholly up to the individual to embrace.

Addtional Edit: The changing of the conditions of a flags presence shouldn't impeach upon your heritage or choice of nationality either. (if you feel British, having a flag shown less doesn't change your heritage or the extent to which embrace that nationality)

Personally I embrace that I have a dual-nationality by birthright and I wholly intend to take advantage of that.

Not sure I fancy our chances tomorrow but I haven't really fancied us in any games so who knows. 

I think our main problem now is that none of the players we really need would likely come to the club for the right reasons. Players that we need right now are ones that can cut it in the premier league and have the desire to perform. The only real incentives to come to QPR at the moment are likely for the money, as a step up from their current or to prove themselves and try and get picked up by a bigger team if we go down. That leaves us with players that probably aren't good enough or more mercenaries. We just have to hope that anyone that does come in falls under the category of trying to prove themselves.",0,1357906253,null,0,false,0,c7v0ils,t3_16dhoi,t1_c7v0ils,t3_16dhoi,null,1430925996,2,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,2

That is a complicated issue, and you will need to talk to the CAB. You can potentially end up liable for court costs, so it is risky.

But you do have leverage. The landlords have money in the deposit to cover the last months rent. And they have a good tennant willing to take over the tenancy right away. And finally you have the potential to make a lot if bother for them with the landlord by making an issue about them knowing you lived there. Or, frankly, by staying there and not paying rent. An eviction will cost them and the landlord enormously, and they desperately want to avoid that.

Only losing some of the deposit is a fairly good outcome, the amount if money lost is small, and less than you would spend moving.

You don't need to be confrontational with them, just let them know you are happy to take over the tenancy the month after this one, and that they can talk to the person in the tenancy agreement if they want the rent, or let it be covered by the deposit.  

The only issue they are being shady on is wanting to security check your dad again. There is really no need, and the security checks are a bit if a racket. Again, I suspect you could negotiate on that and the fees given the circumstances. They have more to lose here than you.

A lot of your fans may see us as crying scousers, but you cant deny that it hasn't been with good reason. Ignoring footballing rivalries between our two sets of fans for now, scousers are bemoaned throughout the UK as whining and militant. Mostly over both Liverpool and Everton fans protesting (Rightly so as has been proven), standing up and fighting the slander the city has faced from the media, police, local government, and national government. So then to move beyond the vitriolic posts that were eventually deleted by one of your mods, then goes and acts, you cant deny, extremely antagonistically about our response and further perpetuates that all we do is cry and moan. 

It does become somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy as I am sure you will agree. But realistically are we supposed to accept that? Are we supposed to take abuse in anyway and just accept it and continue on wards as if nothing was wrong? Do we do the banner bet when it is obviously going to cause friction between our two groups of fans? 

I am positive there would have been equal backlash if we posted abusive content that was related to Munich, but we didn't, 3 pictures of banter before the noes started to appear on our thread.

They aren't ""high art"" films, if you watch pulp fiction and you think its ""high art"" you're being a philistine. Don't get me wrong, I love almost every scene in pulp fiction.

I think the reason why people give Tarantino so much credit is because he does what is seemingly impossible to do with big budget flicks today: get a camera on a good actor who is acting to well written dialogue as part of a well written story. The violence is just a indulgent spectacle only possible through a medium like cinema.

His best work, in my opinion, is Jackie Brown because it has a lot of ""good actors acting"". Its not rocket science but studios seem to think that everyone is stupid and get bored when a person talks for about 5 minutes. If you can't follow a 5 minute conversation where you don't say anything, you have some severe social disability, but Transformers sells better so who can argue.

If the films were about challenging modern societies take on violence that would be clear, they aren't, they are about *the exact plot that was written* they aren't analogies, they are just stories. Yeah, unchained is about slavery in a general sense, but it isn't applicable to ""how we're all slaves in the modern world"", or ""what we'd love to do to our ex-bosses"" stop this deconstruction, I'm fairly certain QT doesn't make films for people with degrees in English Literature to decompose into essays.

The United Kingdom is a distinct legal entity outside Wales, Scotland, England, whatever.  This is another fabrication coming from a woefully informed Scottish Independence debate.

&gt;On Salmond, he was just cleared on the ""legal advice"" charge yesterday, as he did take legal advice, just not on the specifics that his opponents had assumed.

Well that's not entirely true either, is it.  He claimed to have had legal counsel on this specific issue, and then it turns out he did not and had made it up - but after appointing his own judge he was cleared as having muddled his words.  But the dishonesty is dripping.

It's brilliant.  They're literally making arguments up out of nowhere and then sulking when they don't ring true.

You can't be independent from the UK and then claim a right to the EU by part of the UK signature.   And like it or not the Council has come back.

The Council writes a letter to a House of Lords committee, so it's not just Barosso standing up, there's Article 49 of the Lisbon Treaty, the FT reports that behind closed doors there is simple unanimity on the matter - but Scottish ministers keep telling the EU that they don't understand the EU's own stance.

My father is a United supporter and we have had to agree to disagree on some of these issues, because of the way many were presented in the media - obviously he hasn't the time to read up on our defence of things like the racism judgement and the recent handball, especially when it is to do with a rival club, so my opinion is starkly different from his. On reddit those differences are exacerbated by the keyboard warriors and trolls, so that is probably a big motivator behind the silent downvote brigades and other such nonsense.

Frankly, we as a subreddit will likely be touchy about things until we regain some of our previous standing and stop having to constantly experience things like Suarez being English football's villain.

The downvoted ones on the [liverpool version](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/16bviy/banner_bet_with_rreddevils/). Go ahead and look at the downvoted ones. Most are people saying no (and clearly some people saying stupid shit which is downvoted and hidden). Clearly, i imagine, some downvoting will be from United fans.

And I know you're not supposed to do this, BUT COAST LIKE FUCK. Coming up to a junction? Go down into third @ 20.. then coast in, stop and get your first gear, then go. It isn't worth going down all the gears, I never do when I drive these days, I coast around corners all the time too.

They find the most cost effective way of doing things, which keeps their capital costs down, while at the other end maximising earnings.

This is why they have a reputation (not surprisingly) to being utter shits to their suppliers when it comes to pricing and negotiation, and throw up (pun intend) the most hideous supermarkets.  

In the past couple of years they have recognised that they are loosing ground to their competitors and their single minded focus on profit is weakening.  THis should lead to smarter stores, better fresh food offering, more in store butchers till operators, the finest range becoming ""finest"" once again ect.

Doing no damage? As I said earlier, there is evidence to suggest it decrease sexual pleasure and this makes sense given the very high density of nerve endings on the foreskin. Issues of hygiene or disease prevention are not anywhere near important enough to get it cut as soon as the baby is born. There is no reason not to wait until they are 18 and are able to make an informed decision for themselves. The foreskin can be cleaned by allowing water to run it during a shower - takes seconds at most, and even the circumcised need to keep their penises clean.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Honestly, you need to see a specialist. Get a referral immediately.  GP's are fucking clueless when it comes to major skin complaints. They'll palm you off with heavy steroid creams ( Betnovate, Dermovate etc. )  that thin the skin and make it worse; if it gets infected, you're in a world of shit bud.

It basically took me 3 months to see a skin specialist ( from referral to appointment )  when I had seriously bad eczema a few years ago - like my legs weeping because it became infected bad. I came back to the UK on a tour bus from Snowbombing in Austria and it was the most uncomfortable 15 hour experience I've ever had in my life, I was literally clawing my skin off. 

I really had to push my GP to get a referral, but once I saw the specialist it was cured in three weeks.

FTR: He took one look at my skin and prescribed a specialized dose of Arithromicin ( antibiotic for the infection ) Fucibet cream, Dermol to wash with and Eumovate cream ( a non heavy steroid ) 

Also: I will add that I sopped drinking 9 months ago and I haven't had one sign of eczema since; for the first time in 15 years. 

TL;DR: Get a referral, see a specialist.

    b. Inebriated people

    c. Known tall-tale tellers

    d. People viewing known phenomena but who are unaware of said phenomena

2. 9.99999% of UFO sightings are from credible sources, but are handily explained without invoking an alien visit.

3. The last 0.00001% of sightings are from credible sources and are hard to explain. In that rare event, it's STILL more likely that the observed phenomenon was some weather pattern, meteor, satellite, air vehicle, or bird.

All we are seeing is the natural result of tying benefits to inflation and far from being unsustainable it's seen by some economists as one of the checks on boom and bust (in fact I'm pretty sure this was the Chancellor's view ) and is only going to be a problem years down the line if the economy remains stagnant or goes in to recession again (Oh, well that the explains *that* change of heart then) but the upshot is that even if we'd let benefits rise with inflation people on benefits would still be vastly less well off relation to every one else than they have been in the past. 

So ""fair"" in this case means returning to a trend of increasing ""unfairness"" to those who need help. WOO!

Matt Smith's seasons seem to play a bit too much with that, and it ends up getting over-complicated I think. A lot of the big finishes rely on paradoxes and resets and reality altering deus ex machina. If that's not someone's cup of tea, I can see why they would dislike Moffat's seasons. The show has focused more on the impossible mechanics of time travel and sacrificed a lot of the wacked out sci-fi and personal character driven stories of the Davies seasons.

For me personally, I definitely think the Davies seasons were better and more fun to watch, but I wouldn't say Moffat ruined anything. However, he did fundamentally change the show. With a shift like that, there are bound to be some detractors.

Weed sprayed with silica and other adulterants may be (grit weed) - i.e perhaps the weed you have been smoking was contaminated?

Did you buy your herb from people you knew and trust who grow it - or from a 'dealer' / gang  / taxi driver, etc?

Have you heard of grit weed ? 

I gave up smoking (tobacco) 18 months ago and still smoke weed (pure) daily - my lungs are so so so much better I have no cough any more and have far more energy (and can actually run now without collapsing). I only ever smoke stuff I know how it originated - never from 'dealers' as the majority of weed sold in the UK has been 'treated' in some way.

The reason I ask if due to a few ppl (2) I know who smoked a lot of grit weed have had  collapsed lungs. in the last year or so.

i.e - prohibition has turned a pretty much safe drug into one that causes harm. (like booze was in 20's USA) and the tax payer is going to fund treatment..... Perhaps prohibition isn't looking so clever now?

And with regards to the NHS, all my experiences say there are two NHSes. There's the NHS for routine, low priority things. This NHS is a bit tedious, you have to sit in a waiting room for ages, and eventually you get 15 minutes with a doctor who gives you a prescription and sends you on your way. Or if you need a minor operation or similar, you're stuck for 6 months on a waiting list.

Then there's the other NHS, for when something serious happens. This NHS will get you to a hospital quickly, and save your god-damn life, as good as any medical service in the world. And it won't charge you a penny. Sure, you have to pay your national insurance contribution, but it means there'll never be a sudden spike in outgoings, and you'll never think twice about going to A&amp;E because you're worried you might ruin your family with medical bills.",0,1357916322,null,0,false,0,c7v29c0,t3_16dkd8,t1_c7v29c0,t1_c7v108v,null,1430926824,106,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,106

People can take being shit. People can take bad results. They cannot take being taken the piss out of, which is exactly what has happened with Di Matteo being sacked for very little and being replaced by a man whom is almost universally detested at Stamford Bridge.

Speak all you want about unconditional support, about singing until the end, about not bashing coaches or players. Simple fact is that you don't understand what the people who are far more ingrained with Chelsea are about.

Whereas Mourinho seems to be itching to get back to Stamford Bridge, and while he has clashed with Abramovich in the past, he has a better mentality to deal with a hands-on owner like Roman.

Nope. Only thing I've edited on any of my posts have been wording. The meaning has stayed the same. Can other mods edit redditors content?

&gt;Everybody already knows that about Frazer, but nobody else accepts it as an excuse for hsi frankly ridiculous behaviour. 

Subjective arguments from you once again. Having 4 members of your family killed is a pretty good explanation for being touchy about the things he's touchy about for goodness sake. Turning up at a protest in Belfast? Well within his rights, doesn't give people the right to 'hate' him. The UVF incident in that club he ran in Tandragee? Now that's a valid issue. And if you look at what I posted, you'll see it was *me* who raised it. But I get downvoted because the post was *neutral* on a person *who even the mods clearly can't remain neutral on when moderating*. Your opinion on Willie Frazer is of no relevance to whether my neutral post should be receiving downvotes or not. The only relevant issue is why cybernats (because it's no one else) started downvoting it from the minute I posted.

&gt;unreasonable assumptions of motive

I laid out where my posts were getting downvotes each time I challenged an intolerant opinion, purely because I was offering views from a unionist perspective and even when I post neutral or equivalent arguments, they get downvoted too. Likewise, pathetic insults get upvoted. Thus I can state categorically that the motivation for downvoting is politically driven, ie nationalists don't tolerate unionist opinion on this subreddit. It's as clear as day and you indicate yourself with:

&gt;I do not approve of downvoting based on disagreement, but I can't tell people how to vote that's not up to me.

...you acknowledge as much.

&gt;general moaning about everything.

As opposed to the general moaning about flags that /r/northernireland has become? Look it might be easier to tell one redditor to shut up versus dealing with the larger problem of OTT nationalist spamming of the sub but that's not going to improve things overall is it?
