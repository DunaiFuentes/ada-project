true,[deleted],null,null,"Last Summer, I decided I was going to watch every episode of ""Doctor Who"". EVERY. EPISODE. Even ""Dimensions in Time"". I don't remember much of the latter part of The First Doctor's tenure or most of The Second Doctor's tenure because they were reconstructed episodes. There's a certain amount of pride that comes along with knowing that I've seen every episode (the ones I can remember anyway).

My problem with what ""Doctor Who"" has become is that I feel people don't quite know how to show their love for it without the obvious. Everyone knows what a TARDIS looks like so that's the thing people latch onto to show their love. What they need to realize is that Whovians know what a TARDIS looks like so they don't need to paste it everywhere. I'm not saying that I'm beyond owning something Sexy, but I'd like to think that [this t-shirt](https://threadless-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/submissions/_--ALL-OF-TIME-AND-SPACE-_-presentation_1_twoup.jpg) is in the realm of subtlety. Not so much [this](http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-488-488-90/62/6212/EVS1100Z/posters/dr-who-bow-ties-are-cool.jpg). Well... it's subtle, but it's also gaudy.

I think fans need to find other ways of reppin' the Gallifrey because when we're showing off, it's really to each other. Someone walks around with the Seal of Rassilon on their t-shirt or a design like [this](http://www.teefury.com/products_large_images/battle/1356033107_right.gif), they're looking to impress other Whovians. Far classier and impressive than a t-shirt with ""Doctor Who"" written on it. Someone walks around with something like that on, they've got ""Poser"" written on their chest. But maybe that's the only t-shirt they could find.

Another problem is that there's a sense of laziness about fans of the modern show. By that, I mean that it's common knowledge that The Doctors from 2005-onward aren't Doctors One, Two, and Three. Yet a lot of newer fans only know about Nine, Ten, and Eleven. They don't bother watching anything before that. I have a big problem with that. I don't expect everyone to watch every single episode, but it's clear that there are other versions of The Doctor. Watch a serial or two from a few Doctors. Get a better sense of history. When I hear that someone's favorite Doctor is The Tenth Doctor, I sink a little because I get the feeling that they haven't bothered with any of the Doctors pre-2005. Ironic because the show is about (future-)history. I hope that changes when the 50th anniversary happens. And that Romana comes back.

Why did I watch all of ""Doctor Who""? So I could watch ""Torchwood"". The lengths some will go to...",0,1362368105,null,0,false,0,c8pagcw,t3_19kzhj,t1_c8pagcw,t3_19kzhj,null,1431474622,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,grotbagz,tiger,,"The Irish players that we have in our first team at the moment are highly thought of by the majority of Hull City supporters. 

Paul McShane's popularity has recently gone through the roof, no doubt because of his recent performances. Under previous managers, he didn't look as confident, but Steve Bruce seems to have brought out the best in him. There's an excellent chant about him at the moment, sung to the tune of Achy Breaky Heart, ""*don't sell McShane, super Paul McShane, I just don't think he'll understand, 'cause if you sell McShane, super Paul McShane, you'll have a fucking riot on your hands*"".

Robbie Brady is an absolute talent. However, in his first loan spell, he was quire brash and unruly, selfish with the ball at time and easy to lose his temper. Since rejoining us, though, he's matured into a very good football player. Bags of pace, very good eye for the game, and beautiful crosses from the left. He also isn't scared of a challenge and runs his arse off at time. Great player.

Stephen Quinn has been great since joining us. Another workhorse, runs about and gets stuck in, links play up well in the middle, and seems to play his heart out. And he pops up with a goal every now and then.

Meyler pretty much does the same as Quinn on the other side of the middle, but is a bit more aggressive in his attacking. Knows how to find the net as well. Good player.

Generally, I think the Irish players for Hull are workhorses, hard playing and just getting stuck in. Don't think there are any complaints.

true,supertramp1,null,null,"Although I totally disagree with your opinion here, these kinds of discussions are what this sub is for. Also, I respect that you have responded to the comments here, so here are my two cents on Ade and your argument:

I get that the anti-Adebayor argument may piss you off, but your initial paragraph really pisses me off and is totally unnecessary. Just because other people have a different opinion than you on this subject does not mean they ""don't really understand the game"" and need you to explain it to them. Alright, now on to your actual argument and the criteria you set out for Ade as a target striker:

&gt; 1) Get on the end of crosses and balls into the box and score (no shit, he's our striker)

You're right that no one would argue that he hasn't been shit at this, but you downplay just how poor he has been and how much that hurts the team. Ade has 2 goals in 17 PL appearances. 2 goals. That is horrible. Caulker has just as many goals in fewer appearances. And it's not just that he misses sitters, it's that he doesn't even look remotely interested in scoring. He can't shoot from outside the box and doesn't get in good enough positions inside the box. The fact that he didn't have a single shot against Arsenal shows that. So you have to give the advantage to Defoe on this one.

&gt; 2) Hold up play so that our midfielders and fullbacks can move up into the attack

You say that Ade's hold up play was ""quite good today"", but I would argue it was exactly the opposite. He was not strong enough against the Arsenal center backs, his first touch was terrible as always and he didn't look interested enough to do anything significant with the ball.

&gt; If I'm not mistaken, he held the ball up after an outlet and moved it to Parker, which set up Lennon's goal.

You are mistaken. He didn't do a single thing in the build up to Lennon's goal. In fact, he practically stood still and watched as Parker and Lennon made brilliant plays.

&gt; Even if I am mistaken, he did a good job of holding the ball up and getting a head on long balls in the air today.

I just don't see how you can say that. Again, whenever he got the ball his first touch was poor. Also, he was not good in the air, as he only won two aerial battles. Giroud, by comparison, won 13. Benteke wins over eight per game. So yeah, on to your third responsibility:

&gt; 3) Make runs off the ball in order to open up lanes in the attacking 3rd

To be fair, I'll give Ade credit for this one. He made a great run today which you mention stretched the Arsenal defense and allowed Bale to score. However, I think Defoe makes these kinds of runs much more often than Ade. So on all three of your target striker criteria, I think Defoe is just as good or significantly better than Ade. 

Here are some other problems I had with Ade today:

&gt; Additionally, I saw a few people that blamed Adebayor for Mertesacker's goal. Again, from what I remember, I'm pretty sure we were zonal marking on that free kick, not man marking.

Again, you are wrong here. The goal was largely Ade's fault. Bale was zonal marking the near post space, but Ade was definitely supposed to be man-marking Mertesacker, like he had been doing the entire game. For some strange reason, he gave Mertesacker about three yards of space which allowed Per to get a solid header in. People are not ""going out of their way to blame him"", that's on Ade. You are welcome to your opinion, but you can't make things up to fit your argument.

There is also the issue of the his poor challenge in the first half. I'm not saying that it was anywhere near a red card, but it deserved a yellow and if he had actually made contact some refs might be tempted to send him off. It was the kind of challenge that could have ruined the game for Spurs, just like it he did at the Emirates.

In my opinion, Ade has been poor the entire season and was especially poor today. Defoe is a far superior option for me, and I really wouldn't mind not seeing Ade in the starting lineup again until he shows that he wants to play and make a contribution to the team.",0,1362371448,null,0,false,0,c8pbhxu,t3_19ldu9,t1_c8pbhxu,t3_19ldu9,null,1431475114,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"Decent article. Not all breaking news, but decently compacted. 

I'm truly impressed with AVB in this season, and I'm glad he was the one to take over the reigns after Redknapp.

The squad isn't yet as good as it could, and should be. Our best backup for Dembele is Tom Carroll. Promising, but young and still quite raw. Our striking options are very questionable aswell. But he's managed to get the starting XI to perform well, a thing that Redknapp was a master of, while still rotating and giving everyone a chance to prove their worth. This means more stability, more confidence in the players and better relationships between the non-guaranteed-starters and the rest of the squad + the manager. 

I was very excited when he was appointed manager, and as soon as it was clear that we were going to start a new season without Redknapp, I had AVB as my favourite to get the position. Possibly down to my limited knowledge of coaches, and I only knew AVB's name (which I researched a bit more) through the media-pressure he was under at Chelsea. But for some reason I was confident that he'd be able to do the job with a squad like ours. Not the big ego's. Players capable and ready to adjust. I'm quite disappointed that we were not able to keep someone like Niko Kranjcar, who I think could've made a bigger impact under AVB than he ever did under Redknapp, but despite huge players like Modric, Rafa and King leaving the squad, the replacements have been able to step onto the field and perform. Not in the exact same roles as their predecessors, but they have added their own touch and been able to help Tottenham be a side that looks like qualifying for the Champions League this year. 

The attitude of the players, the manager and the backroom staff have really impressed me. The new additions to all those roles have aswell. 
I think that we're really lucky to have a guy like Daniel Levy be responsible for as much as he is, because he has made a lot of very good decisions. ",0,1362373223,null,0,false,0,c8pc1af,t3_19m04o,t1_c8pc1af,t3_19m04o,null,1431475353,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic over a year ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...
What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio). They use the original actors for Doctors and companions, have full cast with full sound. It's not people sitting and narrating. It's like tv but for your ears.

true,PeelianPleb,null,null,"I apologise, this is going to be a long one. Its a simple question but the answer is surprisingly complex. 

I'm not a Lawyer, I'm a police officer. When you say rights you're talking about the ordinary caution which is a requirement for arrest under PACE (the police and criminal evidence act). It isn't ""your rights"" as such, a term which is used to refer to the Miranda warning which is sometimes used in the US. The caution goes thus ""You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you may later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence."" What that is really saying on a basic level is that You don't have to talk to us about the offence at all but if you don't tell us something which could help you now then it may be unhelpful to you in court later but anything you say can be used in court. Really its a warning telling you how talking to police at this stage may affect you (positively as well as negatively) in court.

An arrest in England and Wales has two elements, the offence and the power of arrest. The most commonly used power is section 24 of PACE. For example A person could be arrested for theft (offence) by a constable using section 24 of PACE provided that it hits one of the necessity criteria. PACE does not exist in Scotland. 

Not all arrests are made using PACE. Notably a breach of the peace is an offence at common law and carries its own power of arrest. There are some other offences which similarly do not require PACE to make the arrest. Its also worth noting that PACE says ""A constable may arrest without warrant any person who .... ."" If there is a warrant out for someone's arrest then it will carry the power of arrest with it having been issued by the court, so PACE is not used and as such the ordinary caution need not be used. 

There are times where those offences which a person is arrested under PACE where the caution does not have to be read. Those are where a person has already been given the caution prior to the arrest, for example an officer wishes to obtain evidence by questioning without arresting the person (for example to issue a traffic fixed penalty notice or penalty notice for disorder) however an arrest becomes necessary for whatever reason. The second time that the caution would not be given is where the person is so drunk they would not understand it, bizarrely if they don't speak English you still have to give it. The final reason is that the person is so violent that it is not practicable to give it at the time. 

On a practical note it may be that officers wish to leave the area quickly to avoid a disturbance and they get the guy in the van and leave quick sharp then do the caution in the van. 

Legally it doesn't make the arrest unlawful. You are still under arrest. What it does do is affect the quality of the evidence from the arrested person. If they then choose to give a full and frank confession, in court it can be used but it must be noted that they were not cautioned at the time. That makes that evidence a lot weaker. Once the person is interviewed on tape (where its necessary do do so) the person will be given the caution at that time anyway.

Obviously this is anecdotal, but I know of several people in my village, who had all voted Lib Dem in the past, who refused to vote for her because of that statement in the leaflet.  Just something you may want to consider the next time you are campaigning.

I love Three because he managed to be anti-establishment **while being stuck with the military**. He also knew Venusian Jiu Jitsu and got all ""papa spank"" when anyone tried to attack him. Violence was always a last resort with him, though. Always nagging Lethbridge-Stewart about how guns never solved anything, that one. He also had one of my 3 1/2 favorite Companions: Jo.

What's there to say about Four that hasn't been said or won't be said again? I'll point out four of my favorite things about him. One time, he had to steal a guarded hovercar so he lured the guard away with jelly babies. My favorite thing was when it worked the *second* time with the same guard. Another time, he and Sarah Jane were being chased by an alien god and he tripped it down a chasm with his scarf. Another time, he sent who'd be considered Satan to the end of time and aged him to death. And my last favorite thing is that he had one of my 3 1/2 favorite Companions: Romana.

I **LOVED** how dark and twisted Seven got at times. Poor Ace. And I won't ruin the surprise for those who haven't seen it yet but the Daleks have a VERY good reason to hate The Doctor after what Seven did to them. Had a strange lisp sometimes, though, but I'll chalk that up to being Scottish because Ian McDiarmid also has it.

Eleven is more like me than anyone will ever know. He also has 1 1/2 of my 3 1/2 favorite Companions: River and Clara. Which is the 1/2? River never sticks around long enough. Why is Clara one of my favorites even though it's 26 days from the new episodes starting up again?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Is there an objective reason to discriminate against nicotine addicts who smoke e-cigarettes, though?

Yes, the EU is about to ban smoking indoors of e-cigaretts too, the reason is because even though the only thing to be breathed out of them is water vapour, that water vapour contains **more** nicotine than normal cigarettes. So even though that may not be as harmful as normal cigarettes, people have a right to not be exposed to breathing in concentrated nicotine against their will, and so they are getting banned.

true,lsusobeast,lfcflame,,"Did you read the article? Debt is natural, especially when rebuilding a squad. Football may be a business, but it isn't a very profitable one. The good news is that the big loan is interest-free according to the article, and annual losses are down almost £10m. That debt also doesn't take into account the new £25m/year contract LFC signed with Warrior. 

As the article said, a good portion of the debt from this season comes from contract commitments that were terminated. Dalglish's and Comolli's in particular, along with their entire backroom staff and players like Joe Cole, whose contract was terminated early in order to get him off the wage bill. 

Also, millions have been spent on plans to expand Anfield, which will one day result in additional income. Then you consider the players we have purchased this season, the contracts we have renewed, and the youth who have been given senior contracts, and you begin to realize that debt is inevitable. 

There's a reason why most mid-table clubs only spend mildly - they don't have European money to help subsidize the costs. We currently don't have CL money, and spending money to rebuild the squad is a mean to get to that end. 

As long as the owners remain responsible and the loans are interest-free, LFC will be fine. If we can get back to the Champions League, it will be very easy to turn a profit.

I've also found that abroad my iPad's been invaluable. I'd never take my laptop with me abroad, I try not to take it into London and with the iPad I don't need to. If it gets stolen I can track it and wipe it remotely. It's also a fraction of the weight of my MBP.

The best thing for me about the iPad though (and for any 3G tablet) is that you tap the button, it's there. No waiting for boot, just unlock and off you go. You can be on a train, at the beach, anywhere and it works. Watching films on an iPad is also good.

As an addendum to all this, I love the Nexus 7's form factor. I prefer it to the retina iPad, but my wife hates it. I don't use it for anything personal (as it's a work tablet) although I had a play and found that while it was alright the browser didn't feel as good as safari or dolphin on iPad. Having said that, the software available for things like emulators and so on was much better, but I felt a bit of a second class citizen for things that were obvious ports of iOS apps. Finally the last time I checked, a lot of the apps I tried from Google Play seemed to be the same whether they were on a tablet or phone. This is just about borderline ok with the Nexus 7 but sometimes the wrong side of the border. With an iPad it's rare you'll find an iPhone only version of an app you want to use. The iPad apps are specifically designed for the iPad's form factor. You don't seem to get that a lot with Android, although that might have just been the apps I tried.

Blimey this is a long post, I hope it's been helpful otherwise I've really wasted your time. If you prefer Android, consider getting a Nexus 7 - they're not that expensive and if you can get them from CEX or somewhere refurbished you'll save a bit more. I'd save up for an iPad as a tablet having used several generations of both, but YMMV.",0,1362390624,null,0,false,0,c8pfd5l,t3_19lh96,t1_c8pfd5l,t3_19lh96,null,1431477011,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

IT - Software Development / Programming

&gt;Is your workplace affected by skill shortages?

Yes massively, we have a shortage of 40,000 programmers in the UK and that was 5 years ago, the shortage is even bigger now and we are desperate.

&gt;What is your business doing to deal with skill shortages?

We arrange for people at great expense to move from Canada and other commonwealth countries and live here to do the programming work we need.

&gt;How do you think the government could help decrease the skill shortage?

By giving cash grants and loans to people who wish to study IT and programming to pay for their courses and get the skills business requires. The courses should be chosen or certified by business and not the government, because the government has no idea. For example degrees are completely useless and in IT a complete waste of time.

&gt;What do you think local businesses could do to help decrease the skill shortage?

Not a lot really, we already pay ridiculous salaries (£80k in London for a Java programmer who doesn't even have A-Levels or a degree).

&gt;Do you think that there are unique skill shortages to the uk?

There are lots, restrictions on immigration being and island certainly doesn't help, because it stops educated people with the skills we need coming here too.

Business &amp; Technology consulting

&gt; Is your workplace affected by skill shortages?

Quite the opposite. We have too many PMs so our junior PMs get stuck with shitty admin work until we can get them onto a project of their own. Then we have a lot of global resources that we bring to the UK to work on some projects so we've got an ample supply of programmers and testers.

&gt; What is your business doing to deal with skill shortages?

Our company is huge, so if there's a shortage we just hire more people, domestically and internationally.

&gt; How do you think the government could help decrease the skill shortage?

As I've said, there isn't a particular shortage within my company. We probably have some resources to spare for other companies really. The biggest issue I've seen with regards to skill shortages has been around geographic location, so whilst we have a lot of PM's, most of them are based in the south, and for our domestic programmers, they're usually in the south too, meaning that up north for smaller companies there is a deficit. As for what the government can do about that? I guess they could provide support for small businesses who need to relocate resources to meet their needs, but that's a bit of a stretch.

&gt; What do you think local businesses could do to help decrease the skill shortage?

One bedroom properties - needed by individuals or a couple with no children - are worse still. The government's own impact assessment for the policy even references this.

&gt; . According to estimates from DCLG there is a surplus of three 
&gt; bedroom properties, based on the profile of existing working age
&gt; tenants in receipt of Housing Benefit, and a lack of one bedroom 
&gt; accommodation in the social sector. In many areas this mismatch 
&gt; could mean that there are insufficient properties to enable tenants 
&gt; to move to accommodation of an appropriate size even if tenants 
&gt; wished to move and landlords were able to facilitate this movement. 

In addition to suggesting getting in a lodger as the answer, they make the following suggestions

&gt; In these circumstances individuals may have to look further afield for &gt; appropriately sized accommodation or move to the private rented

I think immigration is good for this country, and multiculturalism isn't inherently a bad thing, at all. I also think benefits really aren't much of an issue in the grand scheme of things, compared to some of our spending elsewhere, and the fact that the benefits people take issue with are only a tiny, tiny fraction of that total welfare bill.

I also think this country isn't capitalist enough.

I started aged 28, just turned 31, and graduating in the summer. I commute to and from Donny and have to balance studying with 2 jobs. They have allowed me to swap modules to suit my workload, and have granted me the odd day's extension to ensure that i can get in and hand my essay in on time. 

They're very accommodating, but then in an age where tuition fees are skyrocketing, and Uni's are having to rely on word of mouth and student polls, you tend to find that they go above and beyond.

Credit to the team for not folding into their own half during those agonizing 6 minutes (which ended up not being so agonizing because of how well we held the ball at that point).

While Vertonghen throughout the game was stunning, I think a special shout out goes to Dawson for his amazing contribution, winning aerial balls everywhere, experience and for those last few minutes of keeping his calm and organizing the defence.

It's just like paying the tax that pays for the NHS, except you can shop around a bit for the tax amount that suits you. But then, on top of that, you get bills for medical care. I hate getting these, not just because they're bills, but because bills for medical care is something that is really abhorrent to me as a Brit. Even so, I know that the total amount I can pay per year is capped by law at something my salary can stand. So in that case it's again like tax, but sickly people have to pay more than fit ones. Perhaps that's logical, but it still seems a bit abhorrent to me.

Also, you need to deal with insurance companies. And everyone knows these people are dicks. They will try to charge you for whatever they can get away with. There are things, like pregnancy related issues, that they are legally required to give you for free. But instead they charge you and see if they get away with it.

Yeah. I completely get that. At the same time, I kind of admired Jade Goody for getting herself out there, and making something of her life, even though she didn't really have any discernible talents. I dare say it's almost inspiring. At the same time, not everyone is capable of doing that, and so on the downside it can give children bad ideas and false hope and cause them to aim for careers that ultimately provide little value to society. But I'm of the firm belief that if you do work hard enough you really can get anywhere you want. So it's swing and roundabouts. If you take on a relatively shallow ambition such as this, it's your own fault if it doesn't come to fruition.

&gt;I just don't get why people not only idolise others simply because they've seen them on TV and in some magazine, but also that they want to be this way too. 

I don't think that is the case as such though. To outsiders looking in, that's what it may look like. But I don't think people do idolise them as such, except for maybe the kids, but most grow out of it, and if they don't then that's part of their flaws as a human being, and we all have flaws. The thing about celeb culture, is that in a world where we no longer all know each other like where we used to live in villages of 100 people, celebrities provide a template and case studies of behaviour that people can use to discuss morals, ethics and relationships. People can discuss life issues using common knowledge, themes, and narratives provided by celebrity culture.

&gt;I totally dislike the culture of celebrities becoming celebrities for nothing more than being a celebrity. 

Yeah, I totally agree with this though. It is frustrating and the vacuous nature of it does at times seem quite sickening.

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; The largest demographic, if not now then soon.

Those of retirement age account for about 1/7 of the UK population. Although growing rapidly, this proportion won't double until well after 2050. The retired population is no-where near a majority. 

&gt; They're the most likely to go to a GP or Hospital, certainly for long-term care.

That's an argument for getting rid of the sick, not the old. Old people are only really expensive in the last year of their life. Besides, why the elderly in particular? Children born with chronic health conditions are constantly in-and-out of hospital, but no argument was profferred for them. 

&gt; They get many other benefits, Bus Passes, TV Licences, Winter Fuel Allowance (and sometimes a refund for cold winters).

You could get rid of these things without getting rid of healthcare. In fact, there are many other people in society who receive some sort of state benefit (child allowance) with no proposed cull. Why the elderly in particular? 

&gt; I'm enforcing my own early-middle age hopes that I'd have the guts to kill myself if I get so bad I couldn't take care of myself.

I'm actually in favour of some limited relaxation of the laws on euthanasia for people with your opinions. I don't see how that means it should be mandatory. 

&gt; Pensions actually cost more than Health spending

The elderly made large contributions to government revenue historically. While they may cost  now it's a bit harsh to take taxation on the promise of support in old age, and then withdraw said support because of the cost.

Manufacturing and factory output dropped by a third. The divide between rich and poor grew exponentially in this period. Then to add insult to injury she told the unemployed to get on a bike and go and look for work.

This put a massive strain on the benefits system and caused the welfare culture that our present government is now trying to demonise and wipe out. Whole generations grew up thinking that crime and the welfare system was the norm. 


She then turned the financial industry from a bunch of grey men in suits looking after the nations money into the multibillion pound gambling industry that it is today through deregulation, increased speculation and cheap credit. The industry that very nearly took us all down a few years ago. 

She sold off the social housing, housing that's never been replaced.   

She privatised 20 of our main state owned companies leading to the shit profit driven service that we all have to put up with today. 


The legacy of her Tory mantra of ""spend, spend spend"" is still still being felt today. 



She was, at the time, the most unpopular Prime minister this country has ever seen, only topped by our present Tory leader. 

People either forget or are too young to remember how hated Thatcher was at the time. 

And she was... absolutely hated.

In general, I would take the position that all benefits should be means tested regardless of age.

Manufacturing industries went through enormous technological development during the post-war period, and in Britain investment was blocked by the unions, because automation would have lead to job losses. The idea that the taxpayer should or could maintain those deliberately uncompetitive industries, in direct opposition to reality, was absurd. We might as well have stuck with boatmen to cross the Thames, rather than building any bridges, or hoopers for wooden barrels rather than using steel moulding. 

There also did need to be a shift in priority, not just from the public to private sector, but from large corporations to small businesses.

But, I think you can criticize her in two ways, other than the (valid) point about the human cost of her policies:

* She was apparently opposed to the basic principle of consensus decision making, whether that be in industrial relations between workers and management, or between the supporters of the two political parties. The discord she sowed has seriously poisoned British political discourse. The consensus needed to be shifted, but it didn't need to be smashed apart. Right to buy was a good example of this general divide and rule approach.

* Although her rhetoric was in favour of small businesses, her policies had the effect of strengthening large corporations, through block privatizations, and financial deregulation. The Britain she left behind was more characterized by massive public companies than it was by the small and medium family owned [Mittelstand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelstand) businesses that predominate in Germany.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"If a billionaire chooses to do that, then they will be perfectly justified.  They will have to suffer the fact that they live in a one bedroom flat though.

Now, what you've ignored is that there is no avoiding LVT, someone has to own every single piece of land.  And every piece of land will have tax due on it.  The value of every piece of land will be set by what the market has paid for it in the past, and what surrounding similar land has gone for recently.

Bear in mind that LVT would be more accurately called ""location value tax"", and is levied on an estimate of the unimproved value of the location.  In actuality it's more practical to simply value land not based on what is on it, but on the planning permission granted to what's on it, then on the average sale price per unit area of similarly granted land in the same postcode area.

This leads to the reason that farmers would be screwed over not in the least.  Only if you don't understand how LVT is levied would you think that.  Farming land doesn't have planning permission for houses; and is worth about £5,000 an acre in the UK at the moment.  LVT would probably be in the 5% range (but that's a question for the government, just like what the income tax rate is, and should be selected to cover costs).  Therefore, provided the farmer is making his land pay at the rate of £50 per acre per year, he would in no way be ""screwed"".

On the other hand, the non-domiciled russian tax-exile who's cleverly bought his Mayfair property via a shell company based in the cayman islands will receive a bill for 5% of the £10,000,000 he paid (£500,000 a year).  If he decides to move to a one bedroom apartment in Hull, so be it, but he will have to sell that property to somebody else, and _they_ will have to pay the £500,000 a year instead.

(and before you raise the famous ""poor widow in a mansion"" bogey, they will be perfectly entitled to roll up their LVT as a charge on the house when it is eventually sold -- conveniently incentivising them and their heirs to either move to a property more appropriate to them, make better use of the property they have, or enjoy the benefit of the mansion that they have now correctly valued).

however I think the 'it's an outlet' thing is a bit of a shallow argument when you drill down into it; by normalising and accepting porn addiction as part of modern society we allow people to sit at home consuming porn, who would otherwise be 'forced' (for lack of a better word) to go out into society, normalise, and meet people and figure out how to have a natural relationship with a member of the opposite sex. 

I think porn likely contributes to the sexualisation of our culture that indirectly increases sex crimes, but then it *could* also be the outlet for people who would otherwise commit said crimes.

Because that's good for both of us. No one can claim any misdoings if its all on a cassette tape.

They are, to have someone informed of your arrest [note this is not a right to have a phone call, we can call someone and let them know instead of allowing you a phone call, although if we don't think you're going to damage the phone or tell someone to flush all the incriminating evidence then generally you'll be allowed to use it] You have the right to independent legal advice free of charge at any time of day or night over the phone or in person, you also have the right to read a book called the codes of practice which layout what police can and cannot do whilst you're at the police station. Do you wish to do any of that now?"" Once you're in interview the officer will often ask, do you want a solicitor before rolling the tape if you don't have one, unlike in the bill once the tape is started the officer must go through a certain set of questions and you are again offered the chance to have a solicitor and it is made clear that we can suspend the interview to do so.

Edit; In court it won't count against you as long as you give any potential defence whilst in interview. If you don't use the opportunity to give your defence at interview then the Jury or Bench have the right to draw an inference from that.

In the meantime temps are a lot more expensive than nurses. The NHS hires a huge number of temps because so many staff are on medical leave for unmanageable stress.

I wasn't saying that farmers use one acre, I was saying that to pay the tax, each acre must, on average produce at least £50 worth of profit to pay the tax.  Which doesn't sound impossible.  I did it in units of ""per acre"" because farms are all different sizes.

&gt; what if he bought it through a third party company he owned and that company sold it to himself for £1 or something similar, tax dodging would be so easy with these systems. not to mention land isn't the only thing of value in this country, how much land do you think Google need to run their business, and while they aren't currently paying taxes, i'm sure you'd agree they should.

What?  How would that be a tax dodge?  The bill gets pushed through the same front door.  If you mean he's artificially lowered the value of his property -- (1) it's done on a post code average, so he'd have to do the same for every house in his postcode (2) that price goes into the land registry, and he's going to have to live with that lowered valuation when he comes to sell.

Economists from Adam Smith to Milton Freidman have all been clear: profits accrue to the least elastic component in a chain, which is the land owners.

It doesn't matter that land isn't the only thing needed, it's the best place to insert the tax system.

I don't care whether Google pay tax or not (you're still thinking as a production-taxer), I care whether every square foot of the UK is taxed.  If it is, what does it matter if google are paying or not?  Their costs will go up if they are using services of people who do need land, so they're taxed indirectly.  It's similar to the idea of tax incidence: those who pay the tax aren't necessarily those who write the cheque (in particular, corporation tax incidence is paid by the employees and the customers, not, as you would hope, the shareholders).",0,1362407921,null,0,false,0,c8pho9i,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8pho9i,t1_c8pgkap,null,1431478103,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"&gt;I don't understand your agricultural point. I wasn't saying that farmers use one acre, I was saying that to pay the tax, each acre must, on average produce at least £50 worth of profit to pay the tax. Which doesn't sound impossible. I did it in units of ""per acre"" because farms are all different sizes.

making £50 profit per acre without subsidies is not simple bearing in mind the costs.

&gt;What? How would that be a tax dodge? The bill gets pushed through the same front door. If you mean he's artificially lowered the value of his property -- (1) it's done on a post code average, so he'd have to do the same for every house in his postcode (2) that price goes into the land registry, and he's going to have to live with that lowered valuation when he comes to sell.

what? average by postcode, on my street alone there are houses worth from 80-500 thousand pounds that's just the stupidest thing i have heard. and the price you buy your house has very little to do with how much you can sell it for.

&gt;Economists from Adam Smith to Milton Freidman have all been clear: profits accrue to the least elastic component in a chain, which is the land owners.

how is land the least elastic component, sure it cant move anywhere, but you can move your business to different land pretty easily.

&gt;It doesn't matter that land isn't the only thing needed, it's the best place to insert the tax system.

it isn't, yes its a place to tax, in certain circumstances, but to rely on it, i disagree.

&gt;I don't care whether Google pay tax or not (you're still thinking as a production-taxer), I care whether every square foot of the UK is taxed. If it is, what does it matter if google are paying or not? Their costs will go up if they are using services of people who do need land, so they're taxed indirectly. It's similar to the idea of tax incidence: those who pay the tax aren't necessarily those who write the cheque (in particular, corporation tax incidence is paid by the employees and the customers, not, as you would hope, the shareholders).

companies like Google, or for that matter a lot of businesses in similar sectors do not really rely on the services of those that would require land in the UK, or any other specific country.",0,1362409778,null,0,false,0,c8pi3ik,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8pi3ik,t1_c8pho9i,null,1431478300,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Another winger would allow some flexibility and come close to the '2 for each position' policy of Mourinho. We're always going to be involved in so many games that a small squad (or one bulked up by sub-par players) won't cut it. There is the bonus of having Hazard or Mata being capable of playing central so rotation could involve playing some of the same personnel in different positions instead of having one A-list line up and a B-team of sorts playing in rotation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's not quite that simple. On the face of it, the policy sounds like a brilliant idea but the nature of housing means it virtually impossible to implement. I think we can both agree that if an 18 year old is living in a council flat with a spare room, then he just be asked/told/financially incentivised to move to a smaller properly so a couple with a young son (who have been stuck on the waiting list) can move in. That's easy and we agree on that. 

But what if that son grows up and goes off to join the army and is away for more than 18 months when he's 18. Well, then that family lose housing benefit. Don't worry, if he's going to university this doesn't apply for some reason. 

But then they hatch a plan, and they knock through a wall and now they only have one bedroom so they don't have to pay. 

Or let's say they have a daughter, well under the rules children under the age of 10 must share a room regardless of being of the same gender. But this daughter has a severe disability and needs a hoist in the room and wakes loudly in the night and the equipment required for her day to day life takes up more than half a room. So they move to a property with another room, but then the room where she sleeps, is now 'spare'.

Or let's say the two parents split up and the son moves between the two houses. Perhaps the mother gets primary custody, well she can have two rooms, but the son goes to his father at the weekend. But when his dad moves into a flat with two bedrooms so his son can come and stay, he gets hit with the charge. 

And don't worry about it hitting old people. They vote so OAPs are exempt.

true,iamteddyready,null,null,"Definitely, it can be a hard project to really pinpoint sometimes.  What I'm specifically aiming to do in the year ahead is to first launch a ChangeCamp on Student Welfare.  ChangeCamps, effectively held at other universities around the world, bring students, staff, and others together to talk about issues that are affecting students and the university community as a whole.  This is a great first step, not only because it starts a conversation about a subject so few of us talk about, but because we're contributing to the greater campaign to end stigma and discrimination around mental ill-health.  To that point, I – and a few other sabbatical candidates, too – have signed the see me Scotland pledge to do just that.  As your DoRep next year, I'll push for our Union and our University to sign the organisational pledges as well.

In addition to that centrepiece, I want to focus on the little things to promote positive student mental health.  The Union usually slows down in its activities during exams and stressful periods of the term, but I think our Union can and should do more to promote positive mental health during the most stressful times of the year.  That's about more than just mindfulness sessions on the top floor of the Union, but also planting a Mindapples tree in Main Bar (http://mindapples.org/ for more info on that) to let students improve their own mental health on their own time.

And last, I want to involve our great student-led mental health organisations more.  First by investing in them and giving greater access to the SRC and Union resources and second by involving them in student-led trainings to give School Presidents the abilities to talk to students who may be in distress.  This would be similar to a part of the wardennial training for wardens in the halls of residence, with a strong focus on active listening skills and knowledge about how to appropriately refer a student onto the right resources and help.

I hope that answers your questions about mental health.  If you have any more or want me to add anything else, let me know. :)",0,1362412877,null,0,false,0,c8pixzj,t3_19mpss,t1_c8pixzj,t1_c8pir6x,null,1431478697,3,false,standrews,t5_2st3h,3

1: We are a small nation that has the greatest heritage perhaps in the world, but Labour makes us throw it away, even though we have 'Church of England' it has been thrown away by those who prefer to have nothing - will these same people moan when another religion dominates us?

2: Autism and ADHA is being used as a label to explain away unruly children and make up in some cases for bad parenting, which is wrecking the lives and futures of kids. It is brought about by additives in the food they eat and the way childrens television is designed for shorter attention spans. (cf Tatrazine, who makes the additives and who makes the 'medicine').

3: It is extremely difficult to try and setup your own business in the UK, so many don't bother and just join the so called 'grey economy' instead which ultimately doesn't really help.

4: Who cares / why are we - bombarded with 'news' on celebrities, what they are wearing, how much are they worth, who they are shagging - i suggest if you find amusement in these things you are a dullard and a loser who can't find enough interesting things in your own life to care about - or worse, use interest in these things as a crutch to put off facing the real world.

But this daughter has a severe disability and needs a hoist in the room and wakes loudly in the night and the equipment required for her day to day life takes up more than half a room. So they move to a property with another room, but then the room where she sleeps, is now 'spare'.

&gt;Or let's say the two parents split up and the son moves between the two houses. Perhaps the mother gets primary custody, well she can have two rooms, but the son goes to his father at the weekend. But when his dad moves into a flat with two bedrooms so his son can come and stay, he gets hit with the charge. 

Both of these examples are not fair and I would hope can be contested. Do these make up a large proportion of what are deemed to be under occupied properties? 

&gt;And don't worry about it hitting old people. They vote so OAPs are exempt.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; making £50 profit per acre without subsidies is not simple bearing in mind the costs.

Well, for starters I didn't say anything about taking their subsidies -- although I'm not averse.  As to £50 per acre not being simple... nonsense.  If that were true, there would be no farmers.  Big farms around where I live are about 200 acres.  Are you seriously claiming that a 200 acre farm isn't making at least £10,000 a year in profit?  That's not enough to pay one wage.  I could put a calf on one acre, feed it up then sell it and make more than £50.  I call nonsense on your claim.

&gt; what? average by postcode, on my street alone there are houses worth from 80-500 thousand pounds that's just the stupidest thing i have heard. and the price you buy your house has very little to do with how much you can sell it for.

Bear in mind I'm trying to be terse so am trying to avoid the full detail of how to run the system.  It's not _just_ postcode, it's planning permission per postcode.  So, within a postcode area (bear in mind that's the ""LLn n"" part) you find (using the data already in the land registry) all the, say, 4 bedroom detached houses and calculate the average sale price per square metre over the last, say, five years.  Multiply by your LVT percentage and you're done.  Then you do 5 bedroom detached houses, 6, then the semis, and so on.  There will certainly be distortions between, area 423 and area 424, but they will be fairly small and negligible compared to the distortions in the existing tax system.  The further beauty of LVT is that valuations quickly become self-fulfilling because LVT is a factor in the price people are willing to pay.  Those who were low in area 423 will be able to get a tiny bit more for their house; and those who were high in area 424 will get a tiny bit less.

&gt; &gt; Economists from Adam Smith to Milton Freidman have all been clear: profits accrue to the least elastic component in a chain, which is the land owners.

&gt; How is land the least elastic component, sure it cant move anywhere, but you can move your business to different land pretty easily.

Land is the very definition of inelastic, the word ""inelastic"" is used to mean that the supply is completely fixed.  Regardless of price offered, there is no more or no less that can be produced.

Different land in a different place?  That's the point -- that will be taxed appropriately for the new location.  There is no way to move a location somewhere else.  The benefits that accrue to a location thanks to society around that location cannot be moved elsewhere.  Therefore the accrued benefits should be taxed.  If I were to take a £10m property in London and move it, stone for stone, to Sheffield, would it still be worth £10m?  If your answer is ""yes"", then you're demonstrably wrong; if your answer is ""no"" then I ask ""where is the difference then?""  It is that difference that LVTers want to tax as it is value that is attributable to nothing other than location, which would exist regardless of whether there was anything built on that land, and is, in essence, the value of the planning permission -- which was provided by society as a whole (acting via government).

&gt; companies like Google, or for that matter a lot of businesses in similar sectors do not really rely on the services of those that would require land in the UK, or any other specific country.

So your argument is that they rely on the country not at all, and yet they should pay tax?  Doesn't sound very fair to me.  Ah -- your argument is that they profit therefore they should pay?  Well, there's the crux, taxing production is bad, you get less of it; taxing immovable assets is good, as they aren't going anywhere.",0,1362414875,null,0,1362415953,0,c8pjjpf,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8pjjpf,t1_c8pi3ik,null,1431478991,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But if they posses images / videos, there is a child somewhere that's been abused to get that photo. Perhaps should be jailed since they are potentially a thread, but the key thing they need while in there is rehabilitation.

I rather liked this bit as well:

&gt;After over five decades of almost consistent top-class striking talent adorning the first XI, Liverpool may have procured yet another outstanding striker this year. To my mind, Daniel Sturridge has almost everything necessary to be a phenomenal forward.

&gt;Teenage prodigies appear to be the holy grail in football **but quite a lot of players only click into gear between 22 and 25.** In a sense, Sturridge fits both categories: he was a fantastic teenager, but his development was clearly arrested.

The quote put in bold by me is the one that jumps out. Keep in mind a lot of our players are quite young and we will need another season or two to start to see what they can really do.

* Luis Suarez just turned 26 in January, he's obviously clicked into gear this season.
* Coutinho is only 20. If he continues to work hard and improve his game? Imagine what he'll be like in two season or so.
* Jordan Henderson? Only 22. (He'll be 23 in June).
* Sturridge? Only 23.
* Joe Allen? 22.
* Borini? 21 (He'll be 22 at the end of the month).
* Suso. 19.
* Sterling. 18.
* Jonjo. 21.

Just some perspective.

For a bit more perspective: Remember that Lucas is only 26 years old. And it was only three or four seasons ago where Lucas was ""shit."" Now we can't seem to make things work without him in the starting XI. Three or four seasons ago, Lucas was about 22 or 23 years old.

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"&gt;Well, for starters I didn't say anything about taking their subsidies

so your saying that effectively you wont be taxing farmers at all?

&gt;although I'm not averse. As to £50 per acre not being simple... nonsense. If that were true, there would be no farmers. Big farms around where I live are about 200 acres. Are you seriously claiming that a 200 acre farm isn't making at least £10,000 a year in profit? That's not enough to pay one wage. I could put a calf on one acre, feed it up then sell it and make more than £50. I call nonsense on your claim.

i don't think you know what profit means, or costs of running a buisiness. and as i said without subsidies from income earned elsewhere, few farms would be profitable.

&gt;Bear in mind I'm trying to be terse so am trying to avoid the full detail of how to run the system. It's not just postcode, it's planning permission per postcode. So, within a postcode area (bear in mind that's the ""LLn n"" part) you find (using the data already in the land registry) all the, say, 4 bedroom detached houses and calculate the average sale price per square metre over the last, say, five years. Multiply by your LVT percentage and you're done. Then you do 5 bedroom detached houses. There will certainly be distortions between, area 423 and area 424, but they will be fairly small and negligible compared to the distortions in the existing tax system. The further beauty of LVT is that valuations quickly become self-fulfilling because LVT is a factor in the price people are willing to pay. Those who were low in area 423 will be able to get a tiny bit more for their house; and those who were high in area 424 will get a tiny bit less.

this still makes no sense, in the last 5 years on my street, two houses had been sold for ~100k (due to tax dodging) and 500k, the average value of a property there being around 180-220k, its not just the square footage of the house that was considered, but the location in the street, the state of the house etc.

&gt;Land is the very definition of inelastic, the word ""inelastic"" is used to mean that the supply is completely fixed. Regardless of price offered, there is no more or no less that can be produced.

but it isn't, land can be created and destroyed, zoned and re-zoned, developed and redeveloped. not even considering what happens if a company decide to base all their land heavy work abroad. this here is the main flaw in your argument

&gt;Different land in a different place? That's the point -- that will be taxed appropriately for the new location. There is no way to move a location somewhere else.

are you deliberately encouraging business to move all their high land use work out of the country?

&gt;So your argument is that they rely on the country not at all, and yet they should pay tax? Doesn't sound very fair to me. Ah -- your argument is that they profit therefore they should pay? Well, there's the crux, taxing production is bad, you get less of it; taxing immovable assets is good, as they aren't going anywhere.

they rely on the infrastructure of the UK, but not necessarily the land, you do realise that infrastructure also means courts, telephone and broadband lines, power, oil, i could go on., cant you understand that land isn't the most important thing in every business? all you do is put unfair penalties on business that rely on expensive land, for example agriculture, but also manufacturing. these are industries that aren't doing well as it is.",0,1362416300,null,0,false,0,c8pjz78,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8pjz78,t1_c8pjjpf,null,1431479224,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

With funding for post-graduate education nearly impossible and tuition fees for Masters-level stupidly high, there's very few ways in which academically bright but from less wealthy background can differentiate themselves from every Tom, Richard or Harry who has a B.A. in Organic Basket Weaving from South-East Croydon Metropolitan University of Art and Media Studies.

No. Simply put. However, these examples have no been accommodated for and they will make a huge impact on a small number of people.

Do you see that there is a difference between being 'addicted' to porn and just enjoying it?  There's a big difference between hiding in the loos every coffee break pulling one out to YouPorn videos and watching it occasionally as part of a health sex life.

&gt;I think porn likely contributes to the sexualisation of our culture

I'd be more inclined to blame main stream media than internet porn to be honest.  I think teenage pop stars dancing around on stage or music videos wearing less material than a handkerchief is more likely to 'corrupt our youth' since it's far more likely that children will encounter it in every day life than pornography, just check out the DM sidebar for instance. But that's probably an argument that's being going on since cavemen started worrying about their daughters going out clubbing in furs that were too short.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Excellent.  That's what I wanted, something to argue with.

Since my unpopular opinion was that I will be cancelling all social services (which are simply indirect redistribution of wealth) in favour of direct redistribution of wealth, it hardly seems fair to then say ""well you won't be providing those social services"".  Agreed, that is an explicit tenet.

Now, if we cross off the ""social"" part of that, and instead concentrate on the services -- since we will be giving every citizen an income, equal to their share of the collected revenues, they can purchase any service they find suitable for themselves.  Health insurance, private education, disability insurance, incapacity insurance, whatever.  Since the government is already providing those services for that same money, it is certainly not impossible.  It is my unpopular opinion that we would be able to purchase better services for ourselves with our citizen's income than the government purchases for us with our money.

On to the ""generating enough"" part.  Since LVT is a method, not a number, then it's impossible to know what the amount ""generated"" (and I'd like to point out that you use the word ""generate"" quite wrongly, tax is not generated by the government, it is taken) will be.  However, since we know that the current amount of taxation is available in absolute numerical terms, then it's not impossible for us to know that somewhere between 0 and 100% must lie a percentage of LVT that would equal the current tax take.  Since LVT is unavoidable, we can be certain that it would ""generate"" exactly the same as the current system.  My unpopular opinion here is that the deadweight costs of our present taxation system being removed in favour of the zero deadweight costs of LVT would lead to more efficient use of the productive capacities of the population, leading to, for the same tax paid, more money left in the pockets of the population in general.  Or, if you like, the ability to raise the citizen's income payment, leading to more welfare (in pound terms) than we have now.

What's more, we can dump a great shed load of bureaucracy, since LVT can be calculated automatically by a computer using the information already stored in the land registry database.

* Three / Four carrots.
* One / Two potatoes.
* An Onion.
* Stock Cube – Chicken or Vegetable.
* Small amount of butter.
* Herbs to taste.

**The instructions:**

* “Top &amp; Tail” [i.e. remove the top and bottom bits] the carrots, and cut into slices – the bigger the slices, the longer it’ll take. I personally cut them about as thick as my finger.

* Heat a small amount of butter / olive oil into a saucepan.

* Chop – either finely or roughly, it doesn’t really matter, an onion.
* Drop the onion into the butter.
Dissolve a stock cube into 1L of water [you can, of course, use your own stock.]
* Once the onions have softened, pour the stock into the saucepan.
* Add the carrots; chop the potato into quarter and add that.
* Add herbs / pepper to taste.
* Reduce to a simmer and cook for 25 – 30 minutes.
* Use a hand blender to whip the soup.
* Finished.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; so your saying that effectively you wont be taxing farmers at all?

If that's how it works out, yes, I am.  You seem to have switched sides though.  A couple of posts ago, I wanted to bill these penniless profitless farmers with unpayable LVT.  Make your mind up - either they are profitless or not, if they are generating lots of money from their land, then we can remove their subsidies and the land will find its appropriate price (and hence LVT will take the fair proportion from it), if they are generating no money from it, then it will be unsellable and worthless and LVT will not hurt them.  Either way, LVT will result in a fair taxation, after a couple of years it will also remove any need for subsidies, since the sale price will take care of that.

&gt; i don't think you know what profit means, or costs of running a buisiness. and as i said without subsidies from income earned elsewhere, few farms would be profitable.

There is no need for rudeness.  I know perfectly well what subsidies and profit are.  Rather, your use of the word ""costs"" demonstrates that you do not.  I said £50 profit, which naturally has accounted already for costs.  ""Subsidies"" are also not ""income earned elsewhere"", they are government provided payments.

I have plenty of friends who are farmers, and while they are not as rolling in money as the general population seems to think, they are also not starving by any stretch.

If their land is unprofitable, it will have very little resale value, and hence very little LVT.  If you look at actual numbers, you will find that LVT on agricultural land would likely be less than the taxes that farmers pay now.  It's also so little that it's barely worth collecting (and many LVT proponents suggest doing just that: ignoring it).

&gt; this still makes no sense, in the last 5 years on my street, two houses had been sold for ~100k (due to tax dodging) and 500k, the average value of a property there being around 180-220k, its not just the square footage of the house that was considered, but the location in the street, the state of the house etc.

I really can't be expected to analyse your street for you.  How long is this street?  How big were the houses?  What style were the houses?  If it really is as distorted as you claim, then you should be glad of LVT, it would provide an normalisation of these incongruities.  Further - LVT is officially the unimproved value of the land, so the state of the house shouldn't matter.  I'm quite certain that should the impossible happen and the UK adopted LVT, there would be a method of getting a specific valuation a specific site if you were unhappy with the automatically generated valuation -- as it already done for council tax (but council tax is flawed because of the crazy banding system).

&gt; but it isn't, land can be created and destroyed, zoned and re-zoned, developed and redeveloped. not even considering what happens if a company decide to base all their land heavy work abroad. this here is the main flaw in your argument

How does one destroy or create land?

Whether companies base their work abroad or not is irrelevant, the land will still exist, and will still be taxed.  If the absence of these businesses lowers surrounding land values, then taxes will be less, making the land more attractive.  An equilibrium will be reached, as it always is when prices can freely adjust.

&gt; are you deliberately encouraging business to move all their high land use work out of the country?

Why would that matter?  Is there some benefit to having high land use?

What it actually does is not encourage moving out of the country, but to cheaper locations in the country.  Which is exactly what the country needs -- some way of making the north financially more attractive.

&gt; they rely on the infrastructure of the UK, but not necessarily the land, you do realise that infrastructure also means courts, telephone and broadband lines, power, oil, i could go on., cant you understand that land isn't the most important thing in every business? all you do is put unfair penalties on business that rely on expensive land, for example agriculture, but also manufacturing. these are industries that aren't doing well as it is.

Firstly, businesses are already effectively under an LVT system -- it's called business rates and it has 98% compliance.  Secondly, you miss the point of LVT completely.  Your infrastructure items are available anywhere in the UK; and these manufacturers that need lots of land -- why are they staying in areas with high location value (which is the centres of towns, where you don't want manufacturing) instead of low location value areas that are currently undeveloped?  You also completely ignore the fact that there will be no other taxes, have a think about what a difference no VAT, no employer NI, and no corporation tax would make to these manufacturers?  Then imagine that they can move somewhere that, like the agricultural land, would have LVT of, say £1000 a year.  Why on earth would that be a bad thing?

You have to consider that the current tax system penalises production.  LVT penalises underuse of societies asset.  You are treating LVT as if it would be an infinite percentage everywhere, and assuming that it will be higher than what businesses currently pay.  There is no evidence for that whatsoever.  Quite the converse, it is the rich landowners who do not do productive work with their land, but sit on it, letting society provide a windfall profit as it earns from the infrastructure that appears around it who are penalised.

The target should be a top-4 finish next year, at this rate. The fans need to continue their stellar job of supporting the team through this unfamiliar time, the owners need to maintain their resolve to stay on this current track for at least a couple more years, and the staff and players need to realize how tantalizing this situation is starting to look and do their best to keep the current group together over the summer and improving into next season.

Cameras have to be justified, and in fact you can complain to your council, and they are obliged to respond and give you a reason why there's a camera there.

Let's be honest, most people are doing &gt;30 mph whenever they get the chance. If it really was just a money-grabbing attempt then there would be cameras absolutely everywhere. As it stands, they're pretty uncommon-- and in fact almost always placed in strategic spots. 

Why not just not speed? It's not a particularly difficult thing to do, and heck knows, you might even save lives. So what if there's a camera on top of a random hill?

It's a safe bet for UUP/DUP 'cooperation' seeing as the mutually agreed candidate won't get elected thus not interfering with the current (im)balance of power between the two parties. 

It would be more interesting had they agreed to one in say the likes of south Belfast. Until that happens it's just a way of appearing to 'do something' in terms of unionist leadership whilst not doing anything, insofar as the largest parties are the de facto leaders. Mind you it's not just those two monoliths busy doing nothing since the flag escapade, I see the honourable member for east Belfast has been giving off about the lack of impact of the unionist forum - notably without any evidence of her own contribution to solving her own constituency's problems. Is she saying it's Alliance's job to introduce trouble and unionists should be expected to come along and fix them?

For what it's worth I think the UUP/DUP should merge as their treatment of the flag issue highlighted once again they have no discernible differences in policy. That would allow the natural growth of a truly liberal unionist party capable of representing a cross-section of the community and not just DUP-lite, as if that would attract people from non-traditional unionist backgrounds.

As regards the candidates themselves, well when you have a special kind of political party who puts the suspected murderer of another candidate's father up for election (I appreciate he was probably selected beforehand, but is that supposed to make it ok?) and it's the victim's son who gets labelled 'sectarian' in the media then the quality of campaigning has already been framed in a pretty absurd manner.

Haven't heard if this new party will run?

Streaky bacon is the fattiest bacon there is - that's the reason it's cheap.  Basics bread - dry &amp; lifeless, pretty much only useful for toast.

Eating a fry up of that + 2 eggs every morning is a recipe for obesity and a good ticket towards a heart attack (I say this as someone who has had three). 

Chicken roll - again, look at the meat content and other ingredients (salt levels etc), not much chicken in there.

This is part of the problem, cheap food is full of fat, salt &amp; is generally unhealthy - which contributes to people on low incomes getting fat.


While it is indeed possible to eat for £18/week - it isn't really possible to eat healthy at that price, not if you want some variety in your diet.

You do get the irony of that statement, right?

The BNP are racist bigots but that doesn't change the fact they adopt left wing economic policies. What out of those policies I listed isn't left wing?

The reason your ""comrades"" were attacked by the BNP is because you are fighting over the same ground, the hearts and minds of the working people of Britain.

You can even see the similarities in the propaganda and terminology used. Take for example the BNP supported union I linked to in my previous comment, it is called ""Solidarity"" and it's magazine is called ""The British Worker"", sound familiar?

I'll make it as clear as possible, although I hate making generalisations:

Not always.

A friend of mine has to be on a machine when she sleeps, it's fairly noisy so her husband (who is her carer) sleeps in the other bedroom.  He needs a good night sleep so that he can care for her during the day - she has advanced motor neurone disease and only has the partial use of one arm.

or myself.  I'm hoping my fiance can move in with me this year, but I need a 2nd bedroom as along with all my other medical problems I also get chronic cluster headaches, which mean I can be out of bed any time up to 7 times a night during a bad cycle - again, we need a 2nd bedroom just so one of us can get some sleep when situations like that occur.

Foster parents.  If you foster a child, they don't count when counting the number of people living in a property as they are classed as temporary vistitors - so you effectively have to pay for the extra bedroom, you are paying to foster a child.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Do you see that there is a difference between being 'addicted' to porn and just enjoying it?

yes. but like any addictive habit, the line between occasional enjoyment and addiction is a thin one.

&gt; I'd be more inclined to blame main stream media than internet porn to be honest. 

I don't think you can separate the two completely. the increase in extreme sex online just shifts the standard so that what was shocking ten years ago is standard and on mainstream tv now. 

&gt; I think teenage pop stars dancing around on stage or music videos wearing less material than a handkerchief is more likely to 'corrupt our youth' since it's far more likely that children will encounter it in every day life than pornography

that's true, but the DM is online anyway so if they encounter it there, they can encounter much worse with a few clicks. of course kids will get their introduction to porn via sexualised music videos and films like we all did, the point is that today they have easy access to hardcore stuff where we didn't.

I've not thought through the exact list, but key would be the right to equal access to opportunities. After that, I'd keep healthcare, maybe with more transparent rationing. I'd also add in sustainable nutrition and hydration (read not good food, but to live off of). Finally I'd add in shelter (again not nice, just adequate). 

By specifying a right to equal access I'd expect this to restrict all the -isms as well as provide open access to eduction (both academic and vocational). You'd still have to meet the uni entry standards etc, but so long as there was a way for you to enter at the bottom of the system and work up that would be acceptable. Things like Eton students doing better would be out because that wouldn't fit with equal opportunities. It gives an unfair advantage as is.

true,chrisward125,,Newtownards," I wear a helmet but it's not the law. The government understands that introducing a helmet law would only see cycling numbers drop and with our NHS already at breaking point in terms of treating obesity related problems, it's probably not the best idea.

1. We do ride two abreast, that is part of our cycling club etiquette. I can see where you are coming from as sometimes from behind it can look like we are cycling four abreast but that is because the two riders behind the other two riders are riding slighly off set, giving the impression of there being more. The law states no more than two and hence that is where we draw the line.

2. Dual carriageway - two lanes. Why don't you just overtake? I'm sorry are the roads only for cars? I'm pretty sure since I pay tax from my income and rates that I pay for the upkeep of the roads. You may give off about traffic but guess what, you are traffic. Even if these cyclists were taking up the lane (I wont condone more than two cycling abreast) to safetly overtake you would have to move into the other lane anyway.

3. I do this, your problem is with people who are dicks not dickish cyclists.

4. We have a right to make our journey as safe as possible and while I agree that the green advanced stopping boxes are slightly misguided (I dont use them, why would I shimmy up past a car to sit in front of it, only to be overtaken on the open road again) making progress through traffic is perfectly legal, even motor cycles are allowed to filter. (I dont wear headphones)

Give me a reason why there should?  The state can be very biased if there's an established religion.  We should replace it with nothing, where the state treats all religions equally.

&gt;I went to a COE school and didn't really Christian, but still can appreciate how the teaching was beneficial - in that it encourage civility and imparted some wisdom about life in easy ways for us kids to understand.

I highly doubt you where taught the teachings of Christianity, lots of them are pretty fucked up, you where taught the ones which modern society agrees with.  And you don't need a religion to be moral, people who where brought up without any religion aren't anymore likely to commit crimes.

&gt;I agree with what you are saying, i'm simply saying that it perhaps gives a moral compass to kids and encourages healthy things in general - what would the replacement be?

Moral teachings don't come from religion now, they come from your parents and society.  They always have done.  And you can still encourage healthy things without religion, why couldn't you?

They **did pay tax on their sales in the UK**, they will have paid **VAT tax** in accordance with the law.

They didn't pay any **corporation tax** on their sales in the UK because **you only pay corporation tax on profits**, and they probably didn't make any profits on their UK sales because trading has been though here.

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK - you've managed to pinpoint a couple of plus points to your idea... but of course you have completely missed out some of the huge flaws:

- all of the services you mentioned you can buy piecemeal - i.e. on a case by case citizen by citizen basis. Now explain how to get the country to buy a motorway by pooling their money? Or an RAF regiment. Whoops... you can only serve half of the services needed by handing out the money and getting citizens to buy it themselves.

- LVT tax is nice idea... but what about the majority of the country that owns some land... but might not have the raw cash in the bank to pay the tax? How do you collect it if they did - rely on everybody self assessing... which would obv fail in huge volume of cases. How do we collect from these people? Now i'm starting to doubt to can administer for less overall work.

- What do you do if you own a lot of land (you are rich!)? You sell it and buy another asset instead, land values plummet and tax receipts plummet too. I admit there are other social benefits to this scenario but it's a bit based upon organised chaos.

- How much will this raise? Well you can certainly design it to raise the same amount of money, but of course people don't work that way, and the receipts can of course vary hugely from the plan. 

I speak as someone who see's huge benefits in getting private services used in place of public ones, and recognise the ability of the market to act much more efficiently than the public sector... but this idea is unworkable. The biggest single issue is the break between cashflow (people getting cash into their bank accounts) and tax collected - PAYE covers this in the most part. When you are taxing people on land they are not getting cash in hand to be able to immediately pay the tax out - so at best you create a huge volume of people that need to set aside wages in order to pay taxes later or at worst a huge volume of people that simply don't actually have the cash to pay the tax bills since their assets are illiquid.

true,BusHeckler,null,null,"I have recently dropped out of a Masters and am now doing an internship. The Masters would have been in composition at a highly respected university, the internship is at a world famous orchestra, in their marketing dept. I chose to leave for two reasons, one financial and the second in that I realised that I really don't give a shit about composing.

Firstly, the Masters should be seen as a means to an end, a step on a rung to either further study in a research postgrad (usually PhD) or because you can't get the job you want now without the masters.

If you want to be a lecturer you will have to get a PhD, but it is often the case that you don't actually need a masters to get on to a PhD programme. Email or call the administrators at universities with lecturers you would like to study under to find out if you can do this.

The way to fund a masters is either to work first and earn the money, be loaned the money privately through a family member/friend or a bank, to take out a loan through the Professional Career Development Loans (PCDL) scheme or to get funding through the university itself or a research council.

If you choose to work to pay your fees and living, **you should make sure you already have large savings**. This is what I did wrong, I banked on getting a part time job and, although I did get a job, I couldn't get enough hours to pay for living costs and fees. In a labour-soaked, job-poor market I couldn't get a second job.

If you choose a personal loan, you'll need an amazing credit rating and  have to be careful of interest rates. You will also almost certainly have to start repayments immediately. Obviously through a family member or friend this is a personal agreement but you should get it all written down by a lawyer in case there is some kind of dispute. This also includes living in other peoples houses to reduce your living costs - always get it on paper.

A PCDL is a viable option and you should google it. It is a loan which isn't repayable until after you finish study but the interest is still large and the process happens quite last minute which can be a problem. They are meant to top-up funds you already have rather than be a way of paying for everything.

Research councils (of which there should be at least one for your field) apportion grants to students who are worthy of them academically. There is a **VERY** limited pot for masters students as their purpose is to fund research not taught programmes (masters are Postgrad Taught programmes, PhDs are PG Research). Most councils are limiting funding so that only PhDs get funding. It is also variable on your own university's profile so can be hit and miss. The Universities themselves do have pots for funding masters students but these are usually small and often it will be in the hundreds not the thousands of pounds.

Both research councils and universities applications processes aren't too complicated but have to be done really promptly. If you miss the deadline, you miss out (another thing I did wrong...). They are always worth asking though, some people get a full fees allocation or even fees plus some living expenses.

If you are in need of more help, your university should have advice services there to help you find resources to continue your study, and google is your friend!

Lastly my final point would be that doing a Masters isn't limited to right now. I intend to work for a few years, get some cash behind me then take a sabbatical and get me some more letters when I have the money (/do it part time).",0,1362430933,null,0,false,0,c8poy0u,t3_19ngar,t1_c8poy0u,t3_19ngar,null,1431481596,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10

Maybe, I'm not 100% on whether I agree to it as a right outright, maybe with some light restrictions for unjustified hate.

&gt;Freedom of expression

Similar to above. As an example graffiti art can be a form of expression and it can look good but no one should have the right to do it on other people's property if they don't want it.

&gt;Freedom of religion

Honestly don't really worry about specifying this. Which one you subscribe to shouldn't affect your life if you have a right to equal access to opportunities. I'd actually quite happily restrict a religion if it tried to restrict the rights of others.

&gt;Right to a fair and speedy trial and right to refuse entry onto your property without a warrant

Can agree with this.

&gt;Right to vote assuming no history of violent crime

I'd rather have voting as a privilege you can earn and lose. Neither fixed indefinitely (except for those in prison for life etc)

&gt;Right to protect yourself if being attacked

Maybe rephrased as right to not be attacked. I'm quite happy for those who impinge on others rights to lose their on rights.

true,SFHalfling,null,null,"&gt;But even then, I believe mile for mile public transport is still a cheaper option than car ownership and running.

Having used public transport for over a year daily in college, then again in Uni, not really.

My local bus service (First) doesn't allow you to buy returns before 9.30am, and costs £1.70 each way, when driving it was costing me &lt;£10 a week, vs £17*. Plus I could leave 30mins later, and didn't have to walk for 15mins to get to the station. The one time I took a taxi because of bad weather it cost me £8 to travel 1 way, the alternative being not to go.

When living ~80miles from home for Uni, it cost the same amount to travel home and back on the train as it did to drive, with a 16-25train card, without it was ~£5-10 more expensive. The train dropped me at a station 5miles from home, with a transfer taking around 1hour extra so I ended up getting collected by family each time.

There is the cost of insurance/tax with a car, and this does bring the values much closer in line, but once you get some no claims, and if you have a low tax/insurance bracket car it is still cheaper, of course if you don't have one of these it can be much more expensive. And all of my prices are based on 1 person traveling, if you have a group that travels with you you end up with much cheaper journeys overall. e.g. when driving home from Uni I would charge friends £15 to come with me, making a return trip cost £15each, as opposed to £30-40.

Cycling is obviously free, but its not acceptable all year round, and would be no use to me traveling 15miles each way to and from work each day.

I always disagree with this, I believe as long as you're not directly hurting or threatening anyone specific whatever you say should be totally legal.

&gt;Similar to above. As an example graffiti art can be a form of expression and it can look good but no one should have the right to do it on other people's property if they don't want it.

That would be destruction or damage of property which is very different.  Also I don't believe freedom of speech and expression should apply at all on private property, it should be up to the property owners.  I'm only against it for the state controlling it.

&gt;I'd rather have voting as a privilege you can earn and lose. Neither fixed indefinitely (except for those in prison for life etc)

Voting should be a primary right no matter what I think, otherwise you may have it where 40% of the population can vote, and they would only vote for things which benefited them, and not the other 60%.  In fact you could have cases that way where 21% of the population was in control and had the ability to prevent the others from ever being able to vote.

&gt;Maybe rephrased as right to not be attacked. I'm quite happy for those who impinge on others rights to lose their on rights.

When you put money in a bank you are investing your money in a bank. It's still investing. It's not backtracking if it's exactly what I've been saying, you just choose to ignore what I'm saying.

I've read what you said and still think it's fundamentally flawed, you're implying that money put into a bank account isn't an investment.

&gt;One again here you are ignoring my point. Are you telling me that you believe all tax is wrong? This is an argument that all tax is wrong and yet you only seem to be arguing that tax that goes towards welfare is wrong. will you please explain this point you are making. if your answer is that you do not think all tax is wrong then you have to justify why you think tax that goes towards welfare is wrong in a way that doesnt actually argue against all tax on principle, which is what you have just done.

While tax may be necessary it is still ultimately wrong. Governments should seek to tax as little as possible.

You ask how much it would cost to set up a stall. the answer is to much for somebody who does not already have a job. How much do you think it costs to buy the produce and rent the space etc? The fact is that you are clearly ignorant of everyday life and you keep showing that.

There are an infinite number of jobs, there will never be a point at which jobs are suddenly finished being created.

If someone was to work and then reinvest that money in a business they'd be fine, or they could get a loan. Handing out welfare certainly doesn't help.

&gt;Do you believe that everyone who is unemployed can successfully start up their own business? Even if they could afford it which they cannot.

I do. If one can work for an employer one can become a business owner.

&gt;I have another question for you; why does the 'crown' defend the 'Realm'?

Because who else will? The private sector does a lot, but it doesn't defend the Realm.

&gt;I never said they were the vast majority of poor in this country. you said they were not the poor and i said they were. now you have changed your mind. poverty is defined as living on less than a certain amount. it's not based on the source of your income. People on welfare have a low income. Just because that income comes from the state it does not disqualify them as the poor. Also, given that the majority of our welfare budget goes on the working poor, cutting welfare would hurt the 'poor' as you define them much more than the 'welfare poor'. 

Now you're just being deliberately dense.

I've explained it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/19ku59/a_11_cut_to_the_state_pension_would_satisfy/c8p6ct8) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/19ku59/a_11_cut_to_the_state_pension_would_satisfy/c8pmgff).

Stop using ""the poor"" in place of ""benefit claimants"", because I see exactly what you're doing and why you're doing it.

&gt;So you think that people keep on investing for ever, no matter how much money they have?

No, they invest up to the point that they run out of money. It's the same with everyone, I invest and so do you.

&gt;you think the reason the rich do not invest now is because they do not have enough money?

They do invest, but they'd invest a lot more if they had the money to invest.

&gt;Idiot. You don't think they care about what their is to invest in?? You have a 12 year old's view of economic. you explain things via meaningless words without actually attempting to explain in detail how something might work.

That's pretty rich coming from you. You've been arguing against basic economics.

Your only hope has been to erect straw men because you can't actually argue against anything I say.

&gt;If your so sure about your economic plan, take me through an example of someone who is given £60 a week on welfare and how they find a job via starting up a business. Also make sure your example can apply to all the unemployed, you quite obviously have no understanding of supply and demand. 

They could buy a bucket and wash cars. They could buy some stock and sell it. They could do some landscaping.

&gt;Have you heard of the idea of the social contract and do you believe in it?

I understand it and agree with it. It doesn't change the fact that people have property rights and that any money they earn is ultimately their property. If you cut taxes you're not giving anyone anything, you're simply taking less.

&gt;Also, those 7 billion people on the planet have to be able to afford the products being sold to them

Yes, but most of the developing world is going through growth. So every year their buying power is larger than the previous.

&gt;Do you or do you not think that we could ever compete with the wages of workers in China? If the answer is yes, do you think we should? If the answer is no to either of these questions, How would we remain competitive on these terms as you have previously said? 

It's not necessary about wages, there other costs. For a start there are tariffs and transport costs to take into consideration.

Cutting certain regulations and taxes could be a good start in increasing our competitiveness.

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"&gt;If that's how it works out, yes, I am. You seem to have switched sides though. A couple of posts ago, I wanted to bill these penniless profitless farmers with unpayable LVT. Make your mind up - either they are profitless or not, if they are generating lots of money from their land, then we can remove their subsidies and the land will find its appropriate price (and hence LVT will take the fair proportion from it), if they are generating no money from it, then it will be unsellable and worthless and LVT will not hurt them. Either way, LVT will result in a fair taxation, after a couple of years it will also remove any need for subsidies, since the sale price will take care of that.

thats just inflation, so cosrts and will increase to match that.

&gt;There is no need for rudeness. I know perfectly well what subsidies and profit are. Rather, your use of the word ""costs"" demonstrates that you do not. I said £50 profit, which naturally has accounted already for costs. 

wages are a cost, you were asking how farmers could pay wages.

&gt;""Subsidies"" are also not ""income earned elsewhere"", they are government provided payments.

if the government provide payments is that not income generated outside of farming?

&gt;If their land is unprofitable, it will have very little resale value, and hence very little LVT. If you look at actual numbers, you will find that LVT on agricultural land would likely be less than the taxes that farmers pay now. It's also so little that it's barely worth collecting (and many LVT proponents suggest doing just that: ignoring it).
this still makes no sense, in the last 5 years on my street, two houses had been sold for ~100k (due to tax dodging) and 500k, the average value of a property there being around 180-220k, its not just the square footage of the house that was considered, but the location in the street, the state of the house etc.

people invest in land for financial security and other reasons, the value of the land is not linked perfectly to profit alone.

&gt;I really can't be expected to analyse your street for you. How long is this street? How big were the houses? What style were the houses? If it really is as distorted as you claim, then you should be glad of LVT, it would provide an normalisation of these incongruities.

my house was not the 500k house, which btw sold for far more than it was worth. i wouldnt want one idiot who doesnt know what a house is worth and has too much money to bear on my taxes.

&gt;Further - LVT is officially the unimproved value of the land, so the state of the house shouldn't matter. I'm quite certain that should the impossible happen and the UK adopted LVT, there would be a method of getting a specific valuation a specific site if you were unhappy with the automatically generated valuation -- as it already done for council tax (but council tax is flawed because of the crazy banding system).

one of the main reasons i think this idea is so bad, is that the closest thing we have too it has shown to be a disaster, business rates also, personally i think these should be abolished or heavily reduced anyway.

&gt;How does one destroy or create land?

barrages, dams, concrete and steel, and dynamite, diggers, drills and shovels, that's the obvious way. land can and is often destroyed, if admittedly the creation of land is a bit rarer. but zoning can change, a city might only have 2km^2 of land designated for commercial property, perhaps making it valuable, then next election the council decide to increase the amount of commercial zoned land to 20km^2 which would obviously decrease its value.

&gt;Whether companies base their work abroad or not is irrelevant, the land will still exist, and will still be taxed. 

at a higher rate relative to the value to compensate the general decrease in value.

&gt;If the absence of these businesses lowers surrounding land values, then taxes will be less, making the land more attractive. An equilibrium will be reached, as it always is when prices can freely adjust.

no, land in the entire country would be devalued, however income from taxes would need to be the same, so it would have to increase to meet need, so taxes as % of whatever you are taxing would have to increase.

&gt;What it actually does is not encourage moving out of the country, but to cheaper locations in the country. Which is exactly what the country needs -- some way of making the north financially more attractive.

i admire the goal, but land abroad is still cheaper, and would not be taxed like this so would be advantageous to move

&gt;Firstly, businesses are already effectively under an LVT system -- it's called business rates and it has 98% compliance. Secondly, you miss the point of LVT completely. 

yes and imo rates are too high and restrict smaller companies unfairly

&gt;Your infrastructure items are available anywhere in the UK; 

super-fast broadband in the highlands? i dont think so, dual carriageways in mid wales, nope.

and these manufacturers that need lots of land -- why are they staying in areas with high location value (which is the centres of towns, where you don't want manufacturing)

where are you seeing manufacturers in the middle of town?

instead of low location value areas that are currently undeveloped? 

the reason industry doesn't develop empty places is because there are plenty of places ready to move in.

You also completely ignore the fact that there will be no other taxes, have a think about what a difference no VAT, no employer NI, and no corporation tax would make to these manufacturers? 

these costs would be offset by increasing what needs to be paid for their land tax

&gt;Then imagine that they can move somewhere that, like the agricultural land, would have LVT of, say £1000 a year. Why on earth would that be a bad thing?


now your just making numbers up, while it would be nice to be able to decrease taxes for everyone, what we have already is not enough, and if you are not taxing other things, youd have to increase the taxes that you are levying


&gt;You have to consider that the current tax system penalises production.

no it does not, it penalizes not reinvesting, a company could make a billion cars and not pay a penny in corporation tax

&gt;LVT penalises underuse of societies asset. You are treating LVT as if it would be an infinite percentage everywhere,

um...?

&gt;and assuming that it will be higher than what businesses currently pay.

some buisnesses would pay next to nothing, others would have to compensate that difference FACT

&gt; There is no evidence for that whatsoever.

its quite clear you cant magic money out of nowhere, you haven't explained how this is fairer on businesses that require land

&gt;Quite the converse, it is the rich landowners who do not do productive work with their land, but sit on it, letting society provide a windfall profit as it earns from the infrastructure that appears around it who are penalized.

although i agree rent is to high for houses and landlords, the problem is under investment, their business models can be perfectly sound and even fair. landlords don't sit in mighty castles on ivory towers, they fund and maintain property which the government don't.

I have to drive for my job. But don't let that stop you from suggesting that because you have the right to cycle and I respect that right I should not be on the roads.I saw my little sister knocked down as a child and I never want to hurt another person. My father lost his brother to a car accident. My friend lost his father to a car accident (whilst cycling). I'm hypercautious for those reasons, but I still need to live my life. 


Sorry are you seriously trying to say that no one in your club does that? You may not do it, but you can't say that you can be sure no one else does. Even the fact that I complained specifically that there were more than two (the recommended number) should indicate to you that I have passed said group and counted.


Your club is notorious in bangor for its bad road behaviour. The pink sleeves really mark you out. As far as I'm concerned, you guys are the equivalent of BMW drivers. You may operate within the law, but you make sure that everyone knows how much more important what you're doing is than their little lives.

I do overtake. I feel the same sense of irritation as when I overtake a car going at 30 on the dual carriageway. Yes it may be legal, but this is a fast road and cars are driving at speed. Never see big groups of cyclists in 30 zones, do you? Why can't you stick at bangor west? What's wrong with the seafront? The numerous forests and parks?

Believe me, if I could drive round ballyholme endlessly I would. 


Your 'great start to the day' makes everyone else's 'start to the day' a little more difficult. But see above for the explanation of that mentality.

I agree, but you make progress through stationary traffic, and then someone who has already executed a maneuver to avoid you has to do so again at a later stage. This is especially troublesome if you're a nervous driver who doesn't like doing maneuvers in the first place. Not everyone wants to be on the roads, for some people it's a chore that your hobby makes more difficult. 

I'm not uncomfortable driving. You are a road hazard, like a horse or a tractor. The difference is that tractors and horses know that they are a hazard and behave accordingly. You guys think you're fricking Captain Planet.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm so sick of the debate about the NHS centering around whether the providers are public or private or both. What matters most is the availability on demand of affordable, high quality service. It's no good getting all nostalgic about the national bit if the service is shit and you end up dying of MRSA because nobody thought to bother to clean up.

I didn't know how good health care could be until I came to Germany. Walking into A+E here (even in an east german 70's era ddr klinikum) reminds you of how sick things have become within the NHS. The amazing difference was an air of absolute calm and complacency of which I have never witnessed in ANY public sector environment in the UK. This is something I can never ignore. Even though the NHS has helped me out- Iv'e seen it done much better. 

It's all about the service level.

In the UK....


I had to ask to be moved from a room where I was being stitched because I had a 5 inch open wound and there was liquid and dry blood on the chair they tried to put me in leftover from the previous patient. If it gets to the stage where a patient has to point that out to a Nurse it suggests the following things to me;

This was not an isolated incident- as no fuck at all was given.
The nurses had ""given in"" ie, they just accepted how bad things were knowing there was nothing they could do or say that could change anything anyway.

I'm all for a national NHS system if it's the best system. But what we have in the UK is the people in love with the nostalgia of the NHS. Not actually in love with the service. If that holds things back in relation to the standard of care then it is nostalgia that isn't worth having IMO.

Piazon is never going to be a target man. Lukaku isn't ready to start for us next year. A loan spell at West Brom where he hasn't even been their starting striker does not show him ready, even if he has scored a bunch of goals (especially since the best team he has scored against is Liverpool/Swansea depending on who you think is better).

Falcao is the same age as Ba and only a year younger than Torres. If we got him he would come in and give us a few good season's at striker. When Falcao is 30 and starting to fade a bit, Lukaku will be 22, the right age to really become the starting striker for a world class team.

If we bring in Falcao I think it would actually be beneficial for Lukaku as it would give him more time to develop before being thrown in and expected to be Drogba.

A new midfielder and winger are still priorities and our current system just isn't working. Barca rely on their assets to play a style that involves letting the other team put everyone behind the ball and carving a way through

United are a special beast and are the benchmark every club on Earth is aiming for, not just in terms of success but finances, branding and fanbase. I go to a lot of United games each year, will be there tomorrow in fact, and the thing that remains constant is the style and the direction. Players fit in well because Fergie doesn't waste too much time jamming players in to a system, the right players for the right position are brought in, usually at the right time. While I don't doubt RvP would be scoring more than our strikers have been, I don't think he'd be competing for the golden boot either in our team.

The male nurse was observing the doctor ( I think it was the process of cleaning that was being demonstrated to him) It was like being in 2050 compared to what Id been used to, the care professionalism were paramount- these individuals were not just going through the motions- they were not disillusioned with their jobs and conditions. They stayed with me right till the end of the job. Things were calm and measured- no panic or lack of preparation. 

In the UK I waited in an empty room on my own. The doctors were NEVER there when I arrived. I sat with total access to all the equipment, drugs, implements. I can recall seeing multiple doctors standing around in the Uk doing seemingly nothing but paperwork. I was always concerned about cleanliness because I saw them handling documents being passed around then sat on desks then round again.

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"&gt;While tax may be necessary it is still ultimately wrong. Governments should seek to tax as little as possible.

So you see tax as a necessary evil. What tax do you believe **is** necessary? I basically want to know, given that you think some tax is necessary, what your specific argument against tax that goes on unemployment benefit is? (Obviously it cant just be that you think it is stealing, since you think all tax is stealing but that some tax's are necessary) 

&gt;There are an infinite number of jobs, there will never be a point at which jobs are suddenly finished being created.
If someone was to work and then reinvest that money in a business they'd be fine, or they could get a loan. Handing out welfare certainly doesn't help.

How could somebody reinvest in a business if they can only afford the very basic's? Many people do not earn enough to save that sort of money or save any money at all. Also, it's very hard to get a loan when there not much proof you could pay it back and like i said that generally leads to more debt given that most business's fail. I'm not saying that this impossible, but its close. It's certainly not an argument against welfare.

&gt;If one can work for an employer one can become a business owner.

Explain this please.

&gt;Because who else will? The private sector does a lot, but it doesn't defend the Realm.

Sorry, i wrote that question badly. What i mean is, why does any entity defend the 'realm'? What the the aim in defending it?

&gt;Stop using ""the poor"" in place of ""benefit claimants"", because I see exactly what you're doing and why you're doing it.

Almost all of the poor ,as defined by our government, receive some sort of welfare payment. Not most, but almost all of the poor are on benefits of some sort (i'm obviously not just talking about unemployment benefit). So it is perfectly accurate to describe those on benefits as 'the poor'.

&gt;No, they invest up to the point that they run out of money. It's the same with everyone, I invest and so do you.

Firstly, could you define what you mean by invest for me? secondly, why are people not investing until they run out of money now?

&gt;They do invest, but they'd invest a lot more if they had the money to invest.

What do you mean by 'had the money'? 

&gt;They could buy a bucket and wash cars. They could buy some stock and sell it. They could do some landscaping.

Washing car's would not make enough money to get of welfare. buying stock requires an understanding of stock markets and even if you do it without that its a gamble. What if you loose all the money you had doing that? then what, starve? As for Landscaping, most people do not hire anybody to do landscaping unless they have the qualifications for such a job. if you do get hired to do landscaping have had no experience or qualifications then you would be on a very low wage. in which case once again you would be on welfare. remember the majority of people on welfare are the 'working poor'. Also, jobs like landscaping are included in the job statistics were it says there is only 1 job for every 6 people unemployed. by becoming a landscaper or a car washer you are not 'creating a job' you are just entering into that already existent job market.

&gt;I understand it and agree with it. It doesn't change the fact that people have property rights and that any money they earn is ultimately their property. If you cut taxes you're not giving anyone anything, you're simply taking less.

But the idea of the social contract states that we give up a certain amount of rights so that we gain others. we enter into this contract to avoid living a hellish life in a state of nature. Tax exists so that the state can fulfill it's part of the contract. In that sense tax is morally justifiable. Since the free market has a tendency to create terrible poverty and force people into positions which are as bad as the state of nature it is thus the state's role to prevent this from happening, otherwise the state breaks the contract and becomes pointless. 

&gt;It's not necessary about wages, there other costs. For a start there are tariffs and transport costs to take into consideration.
Cutting certain regulations and taxes could be a good start in increasing our competitiveness.

But clearly China can beat us with regards to regulations and taxes as well. So how do you propose we can prevent big companies building their products abroad when we cannot compete with their wages?

If there will be any change it will be to go through the formality of giving the land to the government which would make no difference whatsoever to the current situation. 

The rest of your accusations are just repetitions of people assuming the worst and deciding to ignore reality. You coming from the position of someone who already assumes the position of constitutional monarch is illegitimate no matter the power she may or may not have. If have any evidence of the Queen having insider knowledge (whatever that even means), corrupting legislation or appointing corrupt officials (keeping in mind the Queen doesn't make any personal appointments without the PM's initiation and consent). And declaring war? When was the last time a monarch declared war in defiance of parliament? I think you'll have to go back to the civil war. 

The British constitution relies on practicality and convention. The PM's job is not defined for example because we just adapt to job to whatever challenges arise. In the same way the Queen's power is not defined but we adapt it to however we want and the reality is she has no potent power left. All political powers ever exercised are now in the hands of the PM and as of 1965 it is impossible for the Queen to extend her powers. With that in mind the zeitgeist in the UK is that we are happy to fund the monarchy partly because of the history and link with the past it gives us (simple human nature) and also only if they live up to certain reasonable standards, accept the intrusions of the press and engage in a huge amount of civic engagements. I doubt anyone is OK with the idea of hereditary power but the 'power' aspect of that is gone now and so is any threat they might pose. Your welcome to argue that principle should take precedent over practical benefits and even welcome to argue the practical benefits do not preclude, or could be worked around, republicanism but saying they are a corruptive influence on public life is simply not true or at the very least there is no evidence of it.

&gt;Whether or not it was part of his job makes little difference in my mind, should we only reward those who excel in unpaid work? Why?

Not at all - my argument is that we should reward no one.

&gt;What's wrong with a judge or civil servant being commended for their exceptional contributions?

Because they aren't making exceptional contributions, certain orders are actually given to the occupiers of posts! See this from a select committee:

*148. We recommend that the Government should announce its intention to cease the award of honours in the Orders of the Bath and of St Michael and St George at an early opportunity. The Government should make it clear that in future honours will not be conferred on a person simply because they hold a particular post. Measures should be taken to ensure that these changes do not disadvantage state servants in the general allocation of honours.*

&gt;All it does is reflect the fact that they have done something above and beyond what is normally expected, or achieved something that many people do not.

On the contrary, many people do achieve exceptional things every day. They just aren't recognised for them.

The uni you go to doesn't make a difference as far as I'm concerned.  However, if you've got relevant work experience, it's a massive boost to your chances and if you don't, pull out any life experiences that are relevant and put them on your CV, take up hobbies that are relevant to what you want to do, volunteer your skills to non-profits. Do something to make you stand out.

The sense of entitlement infuriates me.

I put my modest success down to the placement year I did as part of my sandwich course.  I learnt more in that year than I did my entire degree.  And then a whole lot more in my first year in a proper job.

that said, work your ass OFF! study like hell, do as many extra curricular courses as you can and make sure you are able to show who ever wants to hire you, that you are willing to go that extra mile to get shit done! 

in business, soft skills, contacts and dedication are worth more than where you studied.

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;So you believe that a professor who was pivotal in advancing cancer treatment, for instance, is exactly the same as an unemployed alcoholic who spends the money from his dole on beer and vodka?

Yes, they're both humans. The professor who is pivotal in advancing cancer treatment has undoubtedly done something brilliant, but that is its own reward. It's also likely that said professor probably had a background that enabled him, in conjunction with his hard work, to achieve his goals. 

&gt;That ignores the fact that clearly some people are more intelligent than others, that they achieve more in life, that they provide a greater contribution to our understanding of the sciences and the arts, etc.

But what does this have to do with an honour? Success is its own reward.

&gt;It seems like you don't see the point in reward or recognising the achievement that anyone does, for anything. 

Not at all, that's a very different argument to scrapping honours.

&gt;I'm not saying this honours system is perfect, but I don't understand your beef and insistance that all people are ""equal"".

Because an honour exists to grant power. It is not just a 'well done', it is a mark. Heck, why do you think so many people want one.

No issue with most of the article but that quote is simply ridiculously biased and naively optimistic. Allow me to bring in some perspective to this joint and tell it as it is. Not as it's going to be in 10 years time or how it has been for the last 12 months.

In 2013 (i.e. the last 9 weeks or so), Liverpool have lost to Utd and drawn against Chelsea and Man City. They beat a conference side by a single goal in the FA Cup 3rd round then got knocked out in the 4th round by a League One Side. 

They were knocked out of the Europa league by failing to perform away from home and leaving themselves with a mountain to climb.

And yet, somehow, this guy and most of the posters here, believe this is just a blip and the start of something special. Well, news flash... this has been the start of something special since August and Liverpool will end 2012/2013 trophyless, quite possibly europe-less but with an upbeat outlook on 'next season'.

I have no doubt there are many exceptions to the rule. But generally I have little doubt that public transport (esp via bus) is cheaper than owning and running + parking a car.

There are a couple of interesting facts that back this up..

Around 70% of all car journeys are less than 3 miles. And the average cost to run a car for a year is £4000 (taking into account cost of car/tax/fuel/parking/usage). Most people who use public transport done spend £4k a year on it. 

&gt;Cycling is obviously free, but its not acceptable all year round, and would be no use to me traveling 15miles each way to and from work each day.

I kinda agree and disagree....It could be totally acceptable if the right infrastructure was in place. But I am I think something of an exception to the rule in that I cycle everyday with the exception of heavy snow/ice which are also a concern for car drivers. Admittedly I only do 6 miles each way (25 minute ride - faster than a bus, not quite as fast as a car in rush hour), but would be happy to do 15 miles if needed - hell...I cycled 130 miles on Sunday just for fun, so Im kinda fanatical which most people are not :D

Why is a system of no honours imperfect?

It's actually the other way round - it's your job to justify the existence of honours. What benefit to society do they confer?

&gt;So because some awards are given unfairly or give unfair recognition we should not reward anyone? That is pretty ludicrous.

That's not my argument.

&gt;I don't disagree, but it is impossible to recognise everyone for every exceptional thing they've done. This is both a physical limitation and inherent to human behaviour, people go unnoticed. That doesn't mean others shouldn't be rewarded.

I also have a [limited edition](http://imgur.com/5fOPEFn) of the same cup which holds about 1L of fluid! [Another Image for size comparison](http://i.imgur.com/KMXZwTp.jpg)

[This](http://i.imgur.com/kHZAVZt.jpg) is another teacup that I enjoy drinking from very much, It's a little bigger than the first one, it's not overwhelming like the limited edition one though.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/5oWQHVZ.jpg) is probably my most used teacup, it holds more than the last and the rim is a little thicker.

And finally a little [bonus](http://i.imgur.com/9D7ClfF.jpg) this is the dresser where we keep most of our teacups, its taken years to get all of these teacups and many of them are limited editions which cannot be purchased any more.

Drinking tea is something that I enjoy alot and I take great pleasure in making tea for others to enjoy. My usual tea is Twinings [Darjeeling](http://twinings.co.uk/speciality-black-tea-bags/darjeeling-5), although I often have [Earl Grey](http://twinings.co.uk/earl-grey-teas/earl-grey-5) and [English Breakfast](http://twinings.co.uk/english-breakfast-tea/english-breakfast-tea-641) tea although not necessarily at breakfast.

Personally I think there is no 'Right' or 'Wrong' Way to make tea, but the way I do it is:

* Put fresh filtered water into the kettle (filtered to reduce limescale buildup)
* 1 tea bag for one cup or two for a pot
* As soon as the kettle has boiled pour the water into your cup or pot
* If you're using a cup leave the teabag in for a minute or two (This depends on how strong you like your tea and the strength of the tea you're using so only use this as a guideline) if in a pot leave for a few minutes.
* Remove the teabag after your tea has brewed to your preferred strength then pour in milk, my preference is semi skimmed milk that I get fresh from the milk man every morning.
* Sit back and enjoy your tea!

I must state again how much tea is down to **Personal taste** I don't think there is a right or wrong way to make it, this is how I make and enjoy mine, good luck on your adventure into the world of tea!

Don't be absurd. We don't get to use that land like we don't get to wear her hat.

The delusions are in the other camp, everything I said was true.

&gt; If have any evidence of the Queen having insider knowledge.. 

The Queen literally is consulted regarding war, she literally appoints people to parliament bypassing the democratic purpose, it is well know that Charle's regularly perverts the workings of parliament, the lord's chief aim is to retain the monarchy because it is through that which they also derive their birth right.

&gt; no real power

A billionairess whose family's fortunes is protected by government is too big to fail, and too big not to have power.

&gt; The PM's job is not defined for example because we just adapt to job...

The PM feeds off the queen as much as the queen feeds off the PM. They have had weekly meetings her entire reign, that's a lot of insider knowledge and chances of persuasion to push through an agenda. The monarchy doesn't stop at the queen, it exists as a sort of organism with no clear boundaries. A news paper was threatened with shuttering if it printed Kate's breasts.

It's also rather nice to have an international relations ""team"" which consists of more than just politicians, and it is certainly something that those from other countries judge us on, and I can say that I am happy for them to do so. 

Above all, I can't really see any reason to remove them. They, if I recall correctly, bring in more than they spend in monetary terms, and aren't especially unpleasant. To the contrary, they seem like good people.

Actually Rolls Royce has a monopoly on the aircraft engine market, they make all the engines in every american Boeing, every european Airbus and other commercial and most military aircraft around the world. They only don't make a few highly specialised military engines which need to be custom built for certain things. They also have long term (30 year) service arrangements on the engines, and if they suddenly decided to stop making them most of the world would be screwed.

&gt;and every company that sells stuff (with a few exceptions) has to be VAT registered

No, no no. Not every company that sells stuff is VAT registered. I work for quite a large company selling stuff and we aren't VAT registered. Infact the large proportion of business **aren't** VAT registered. It's not necessarily a good thing to be VAT registered, you want to try and avoid it for a business as long as you can. Most companies aren't VAT registered, and they just absorb the cost of the VAT like normal people do. 

Even people like Rolls Royce who are VAT registered will be affected by this, because there's no way they collect and organise every single little receipt for every single little expense for their business. There will be huge swathes of things which they just write of as whole costs without bothering to go through the VAT details for.

A good example of companies which aren't VAT registered, and which you can't claim the VAT back for, which is a massive cost, is train tickets. You might have to pay £4k for each member of staff's train season ticket every year, and you can't claim the VAT back for any of them.",0,1362439709,null,0,false,0,c8ps19f,t3_19nm4i,t1_c8ps19f,t1_c8prxfe,null,1431483207,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Plaid Cymru I honestly don't know much about.

Why does he need recognition at a state level?

&gt;Oh come off it. You can't tell me that no-one should be rewarded for any of their hard work.

When it comes to a state honours system, I can and am.

&gt;things like Nobel Prizes exist for a reason: independent recognition of your work

Hoo, don't even get me started on them. There's loads of dodgy Noble awards out there.

&gt;Humans like recognition, it's a social phenomenon, we don't just feel better with rewards but it increases our motivation and drive.

I dispute this. The majority of these people who are 'truly deserving' of these awards (if anyone is) do the work they do because they want to do it. They don't do it to get CBE after their name, as I'm sure the OP would attest. I don't dispute that humans like recognition, of course. But that doesn't mean they should be given it.

&gt;It's why you reward a child for their good behaviour.

Totally different kettle of fish to honours. 

&gt;why schools recognise the brightest pupils in all areas

As a winner of a good number of school prizes, I can tell you I dislike such rewards too.

&gt;What 'power'?

Authority. Unspoken authority. 

&gt;The only reason it is so coveted is because it's such a prestigious award. Just like a national award for doctors is more prestigious than one awarded by the local hospital. They are few in number and that, combined with the publicity, obviously means that if you get one it holds a lot of value. That's why people want it. It really is no different from any other award, it's just more sought after because it's fewer in number and on a larger scale. But the principle of the award is the same.

You hit the nail on the head when you mentioned publicity. People want it because they can slam it after their name.

Up here we have Primary School beginning at 4/5 and lasting for 7 years. Aged 11/12 you begin High School that has 4 mandatory years and then two additional years. In your third and fourth year you study towards Standard Grades, studying 8 subjects graded from 1 (Highest pass) to 8 (failing to turn up for the exam). In 5th year you enter the Higher Still system. You sit Intermediates or Highers based on your standard grade results. Typically you study 5 subjects. From there you can chose to go into university but many stay and study Advanced Highers or take the step up in the Higher Still system.

Scottish Universities require Highers, typically 4 B's (220 Points in 2007 when I dealt with UCAS), to get into their courses. They are four year courses so after leaving school a year before our UK counterparts, if you do 6 years at high school, you end University at the same time (A year ahead if you go into uni after 5th year or use your Adv.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's perfectly legal, this is what agencies do. People are often surprised to hear that agencies charge £8k finders fees but it's true, and they are often very determined to get their money (because it's their commission and that is how they get paid).

Now, I've experienced this exact same situation myself before, and there's a few bits of advice I can give you: 

Firstly since the agency got you a job as a contractor it's likely the company was already paying the agency a contractor finder fee (a percentage of your weekly salary, normally around 50% of your salary so a lot of money!!).

Now I'm going to guess when the company you worked for moved you from being a contractor to a permanent member of staff, they did this so they no longer had to pay this 50% fee, *(which was effectively making you 50% more expensive)* and so lied to the agency and said you left and didn't work there any more and that they didn't need you any more. So now the company has you working there but doesn't have to pay the agency contractors fees anymore. A lot of companies try this, and hope it takes a while for the agency to find out (which they always do), and then when they do find out try to negotiate a cheaper finders fee for you, or cut you loose and take another contractor. Now, there is an extra one off fee of £8k or sometimes a bit less (no less than £5k in my experience) that the company *should* have paid for taking you on permanently called a finders fee, this is what the agency are after now.

The agency will have worked out you are still working there by innocently asking you one day if you were still working there in passing conversation, or innocently phoning the company and asking to speak to some random secretary, and then saying ""oh how are you getting on?"" or ""if the secretary has seen you in the office recently"". They are very sneaky at catching you and the company out.

Basically you shouldn't get angry with the agency, it is the company and more likely your direct cost cutting line manager boss that you should get angry with. Most companies try to skank agencies like this, even big respectable ones. At the end of the day everyone knows the game, everyone is trying to save money and noone takes it personally.

There's two things you can do to help yourself: 

* Firstly you could approach the company and suggest that perhaps they could fire you, you can tell the agency they fired you and then they can re-hire you as a normal permanent employee, and you promise you won't tell the agency anything and will pretend forever to the agency that you left them and never saw them again.

* Secondly you could hang it on in there, and try to negotiate with the agency yourself to cut down the finders fee, perhaps not directly informing your company of this. Explain to them how you feel and the effect it is having on your mental health (the worry), and explain that none of this is your fault, and they may be scared into backing off, especially if you talk about medical stuff.

Try not to get anything in writing that may work against you, come back here for more advice if you need it, and if the worst does happen then come back here and we'll help you find some more work (I promise, I'm very good at it).

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;I'm not saying any different. Of course they don't do it to get the award, but that doesn't mean recognising them isn't beneficial to them or society as a whole.

I'm still waiting for an argument as to why it is beneficial. 

&gt;Okay well clearly this problem with you runs deeper than just a simply dislike for the honours system. Obviously you don't like awards or rewards in general which will make this entire argument futile.

Well, you can call it a personal philosophy if you like. Whether you choose to consider debating this futile is, naturally, your choice, but I do think this is something more people should consider.

When I was at school, I was considered a pretty bright chap. I was on the receiving end of some school prizes for a couple of subjects and got to go to the award ceremony in the evening etc to collect my prize in front of my adoring fans.

But I came from a stable home, with two very good parents who were there for me and helped me become what I am today. The prize that I received was not merely because I worked hard in the class, but because I had a better chance from the off. Meanwhile, other children, who perhaps had bigger hurdles in their personal lives etc missed out. 

I didn't need the prize. I could live quite contently without it. Being given it just rubbed the faces of those who weren't nominated in it more.

&gt;Do you think a doctor doesn't enjoy having Dr in front of their name?

Oh, absolutely! What it has to do with his ability as a doctor, of course, is another matter.

&gt;Just because someone feels happy with their achievement, with their award of an honour, doesn't mean it shouldn't be given out, nor does it mean that they were unworthy or underserved of such an honour.

I'm still waiting for a good argument as to why they are required.

Also, Rodgers did say top 4 was achievable. He was even saying so at Christmas time. You conveniently ignore the fact that that's also the reason Dalglish and Hodgson were sacked - failure to challenge for a top 4 spot.

I'm not 'getting at' anything. If you compare the results and the limited time Hodgson &amp; Dalglish had to Rodgers term so far, I see no improvement other than the fact the average age of the squad has come down.

There's double standards at play. Rodgers is being given more time by everyone for some unknown reason yet a year on from his appointment, it's looking like he'll have made zero improvements in terms of league points, position and progress in cup competitions... domestic &amp; European.

Although I am fully prepared to do this, I am bored of education and working my arse off to pay a bank loan for something I feel I have burntout on (for now) is feeling like a ridiculous idea.

Funding a masters course depends completely on the course you are doing. For me, the course I want to do has no funding what so ever and the university also offers no funding for that particular course, neither do chairites or trust agencies. You need to choose the actual course you want to do and at which university, apply and THEN look at funding. It may be that there are studentships open to you, or the course is actually funded, but alot of people tend to drop out of masters courses due to funding. It seems ridiculous/a shame, as undergrads are so easily funded and the process is relatively straight forward.

Among the 17 countries considered, the United States healthcare system was among the least efficient and effective.

This means nothing except, ""The UK spends less on health than it should"".

Which is exactly the point we were discussing before. You were championing the fact that the UK spent less on health care but that means nothing except in real terms the UK spent LESS on health-care. When 82% of that spending is coming from tax what is the point of celebrating less spending? It just means we, well you are being ripped off.........

What would be worth celebrating would be a higher percentage of spending being transferred out of the Tax revenues and into the insurance revenues, more spending overall as a percentage of GDP and demonstrable increases in the things you care most about. Numbers of doctors, standard of care, after care, availability- cost.

What people seem to forget, or choose to forget, is that Doctor Who reinvents itself every couple of years. It makes itself accessible to be jumped in on at various points without having to know much prior. In fact that show will constantly 'relearn' common villains such as The Daleks. The storytelling will often take advantage of a new companion to allow The Doctor to reexplain concepts without making it feel contrived.

You will miss out on stories, yes, but that's fairly obvious. Just like there are tons of stories in the 'classic' Who that you'd be missing out on.

true,PlayingForTheShirt,,Bangor,"I'm going to respectfully disagree with the argument of 'weren't born during the troubles.'

The reason why is it just doesn't rub off with me very well is that it isn't really a relevant argument. The flag issue is in 'the now' and not from the 70s, 80s or 90s. Yes, The Troubles were the worst time for sectarian violence but sectarianism or tribal lines didn't suddenly disappear with the GFA or SAA. Tribalism still very much exists in NI and is bred into certain communities and certain people through what they have been told by their parents/peers/political parties/pressure groups.

There is no excuse for putting a brick through an innocent persons window and I would not, for one, consider the idea of doing it any form of progress. But what you must remember is that to reserve some form of hatred/distrust/ignorance towards a certain community does not mean you have to be brought up during The Troubles. It's relevant today and not yesterday. 

Before the issue is combatted the people of NI cannot simply dig their heads in the sand and simply run off such cliché phrases as 'they weren't born during the troubles' or 'they don't have a mandate.' Yeno why? Because it doesn't work.

We keep saying dissedent republicans have no mandate and most are young lads who weren't about during the troubles but that doesn't take away the fact they are doing what they are doing.

As far as I can tell, this thing is calculating for our best mathematically-possible finish, and any green signifies a result that's more beneficial to a higher finish (the bigger the bar, the more it helps). The red bars, of course, indicate results that hurt our chances in some way. So provided we manage a win against Spurs, it would actually be more beneficial for Everton to win (or draw). An Everton win would see them leapfrog Arsenal, taking fifth place and 48 points. With a win over Spurs, we would still only be three points behind Everton, remaining in seventh for the time being, but with the home derby still to play. If we can at *least* equal their results up to the derby, the chance is there to then match them on points and thus surpass them on the table in GD. 

Now, as I said, if it's calculating for best-possible finish, we can ignore some of the results. Statistically (and with all ideal results), Wigan over City would help, but we also know that fourth place is the real ""goal"" and it doesn't really matter if City finishes second.

true,WadeWilsonsSoul,lfc99,,"I just saw this now. I'm not going to get into a big thing but if you read my comment you saw that I mentioned ""murmurs"" of Ibra and Pep not getting along. However, I think you overplayed your hand on that one considering Ibra said he'd like to go to Bayern after Pep was named as the new boss. Also, I never compared it to Jose/CR7 or anything so you're again putting words in my mouth.

The point, which you keep missing apparently, is that Ibra is the kind of target man that Mario Gomez is not. Which is why he does not fit into Pep's mentality/system. Hence the reason it's very possible that Gomez is not on Munchen for long, whereas a guy like Ibra is a better fit. (Even though I never predicted he'd actually got to Bayern) 

And I don't even understand what you're trying to say here:

&gt;I just think that is BS. Ibra didn't fit the team, yet Guardiola went out of his way to swap him for Eto-o who did fit the team and system? 

So you're saying that you agree with me that Ibra fits Pep's system after spending your previous comments saying he **didn't** fit the system? Make up your mind bud. My original comment stressed how much Pep valued Ibra because he was willing to pay big money and surrender Eto'o in world class form for him. Now you're using what I said to try and argue against it somehow. Color me confused.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;They did pay tax on their sales in the UK, they will have paid VAT tax in accordance with the law.

You don't pay any VAT as a company. You're customers pay it on their purchases, you collect it, and once a quarter send it off. Minus the amount you get to claim back, as reimbursement for all the VAT you've paid on your own purchases.

&gt;Don't forget they will have also paid lots of tax in the form of income tax, which is up to 40% of their staff's salaries, and also national insurance tax

The vast majority of these taxes are paid for by staff. I run a company, I do the payroll. Employers pay a small percentage on top of the money that comes directly out of any employees pay cheque.

I agree that Rolls Royce, if they haven't made a profit, shouldn't be paying taxes. I think this article is unfair and people love a witch hunt atm. I'm with Rolls Royce on this one. But they haven't, ""paid tonnes of tax in the UK."" - their customers and staff have.

They've generated jobs and demand that has helped contribute to UK tax receipts, which is wonderful, but they've probably contributed very little in tax directly from their own pocket, at least going by the metrics you've used. Which is fair enough though, because they're creating jobs etc and not making much profit in the UK.

As you can tell, it is a rich and sophisticated cultural time for us Cornishfolk....

&gt;There is little description of specific traditions associated with this day apart from the consumption of large amounts of alcohol and food during 'Perrantide'. The day following the St Piran's Day was known by many as 'Mazey Day', a term which has now been adopted by the revived Golowan festival in Penzance. The phrase 'drunk as a perraner' was used in 19th century Cornwall to describe people who had consumed large quantities of alcohol.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"&gt;They are life skills, and ones that are important no doubt, however the school is not the place to teach them. A lot of this should be taught by parents.

The problem with asking parents to teach life skills is that they don't do it.
Getting dressed and undressed for PE is a life skill, going to the toilet unaided, using a knife and fork, holding a pencil correctly... all life skills, all should be taught by parents, at home, before their child starts school. It doesn't happen. Reception class teachers are having to do this.

&gt;I simply don't have time to go over stuff which is totally useless to me like DIY and childcare. 

I don't know if they still force everyone to take woodwork/metalwork at school, but it was compulsory when I was at school &amp; I know how to make a dove tailed joint... never needed to in real life, but I have had to spend £60 on a plumbers call out charge because a tap broke &amp; I didn't know how to fix it. I'm talking basic DIY, put a shelf up, replace a tap, bleed a radiator, stuff that everyone is likely to NEED at some point, not useless stuff.
As for childcare being useless, I wish more people had to take childcare classes before reproducing, that is unfeasible to implement, but basic classes at school would enable most parents to have something they could remember back to when they take their precious newborn home for the first time, rather than doing what opur friends did... they put the baby (still in car seat) in the middle of the living room &amp; just sat and stared at her until she cried because they didn't know what else to do!

&gt;If I want to meditate, I'll go to a club somewhere, I don't have time for what is, in my opinion, a total and utter waste of time.
The benefits of meditation are well documented and if (whilst still in education) you don't have half an hour/an hour spare to meditate, even once a week, then you really need to add time management onto that list of life skills you need to learn!

&gt; You forget that children are not adults. It seems obvious, but they need a break and time to be kids.

You have mentioned a few times how you 'don't have time' for things... Just how much homework are you getting... because that isn't like the real world either. Not everyone goes home from work &amp; does more work. If the schools were open later, they could actually get that work done in school &amp; when you get home, then you could have free time to do whatever you wanted to do. To be honest, it isn't about making children stay at 'school' all day, if all schools provided breakfast clubs and after school clubs, that would work too - you could still 'be kids' but it would make it easier for people who work full time to manage.

We have 1 x 5 year old daughter and wrap around care (because we have to both work full time to pay our mortgage and buy food and other luxuries) costs us in excess of £2,000 per year (nursery fees were £8,000 per year, so it's still a saving since she started school). We only get 5 weeks per year holidays and our parents all still work full time (and as retirement ages go up further this is more likely to be the case) &amp; no, before you ask, we weren't teenage parents (&amp; neither were our parents), we had both graduated from uni, got jobs and lived on our own for a few years before we did the get married and start a family thing.

I don't expect kids to work 50 weeks a year (I certainly get more holidays than that) but I do expect that at some point, unless it becomes possible for one parent to stay at home full time, then something is going to have to change, because even if my other half &amp; I take all our annual leave at different times (so no family holdiays or even family time) then we still get 4 weeks per year LESS annual leave than the schools have holidays. Who do you think should be looking after our 5 year old? Do we just leave her home alone? No, we send her to holiday club, which, because of her age, still has to comply with the EYFS &amp; so is (for her at least) basically school still.",0,1362480147,null,0,false,0,c8q2hoj,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8q2hoj,t1_c8pqb4z,null,1431488114,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,soothfast,eng-dorset,Dorset - Who's afear'd!,"Hello - I dabble in genealogy... so had a look.  There are actually quite a few online resources these days, not only Ancestry, but Free BMD that lists all birth/marriage and death records from 1837 onwards.  I did a cross reference for a marriage where the names Legg and Olding married.  Came up with:

Frederick H Legg married Susan E Olding in Frome, Somerset in quarter OCT/NOV/DEC 1910.

(Volume No. 5C Page No. 934).

There is an earlier possible hit for an 1860 marriage but that would seem too early for your purpose (great grandparents normally wouldn't be so long ago), plus the census shows the wife living as a widow in the UK as an elderly woman so dismissed it as you say they emigrated to the US. 

I then had a look at the 1911 Census.  Frederick Legg married to Susan Legg lived in 5 Willow Vale, Frome, Somerset.  Frederick's occupation is listed as a Groom Chauffeur Domestic.  They have a son by this time named William Henry Legg, age 2 months.  Do not discount them because of this though - just because you know of no son does not mean one did not exist.  Also to add Frederick's estimated birth date is 1888 (South Perrot, Dorset - not far from where I was born as it goes!) and Susan is 1891 in Berkeley, Somerset.

The Queen Victoria thing is probably just family myth. These things normally are (though not always of course, but by and large, particularly when we are not that far removed from that generation - its pretty easy to prove a connection if there is one).

The idea that if the Tories stimulate the economy a la Keynes the inevitable Labour government following this administration will perform countercyclical saving in a boom, to offset the stimulus, given everything we know about their last stint in office during a boom, is laughably naive.  Like it or not, this country's political landscape has devolved into Labour existing in the boom, completely fucking up the country's finances, with the Tories being handed the reins to sort out the mess that the previous administration has left.

* The BBC should seriously cut back on the number of channels and radio stations it provides and focus on its core services.  Quality of programming on BBC1 and BBC2 is now abysmal.  There's really no need for four BBC channels, along with their investments in other channels like Dave.  The best programming from BBC1-4 should be on BBC1 and BBC2 with the rest of the chaff just being thrown out.

* I support student tuition fees.  Students are largely the ones that benefit from a university education, with a degree being worth on average £12,000 a year more in terms of salary.  Tuition was never ""free"", it was always supported by increased taxes, with plumbers and other people who never had the chance to go to university supporting those that did.  Now the financial burden of a university education is where it belongs.

* The mess in the Eurozone (e.g. Greek and now Italian elections) has really shown up how badly PR voting systems can go wrong.

* I honestly don't think it matters which way whether Scotland becomes independent or not.  Not much will change politically in an independent Scotland, contrary to what many pro-independence posters seem to think, and the two nations will be natural allies with largely the same interests when it comes to e.g. European negotiations.  Having said that, I think some of the SNP's suggested sources of income for an independent Scotland, like exporting energy to England (why --- we can build our own power stations) are incredibly naive.",0,1362481092,null,0,1362481957,0,c8q2l27,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8q2l27,t3_19mqlh,null,1431488164,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If it did, even if it was a mistake on their part, I belive they'd be within their rights to amend your policy because in accepting the renewal quote you're generally obliged to contact them if you belive any of the contents of the quote are wrong.

Luckily for you, I *think* you have an escape of a months grace period, where you can cancel any new insurance policy. Check your terms and conditions.

In general *never* accept a renewal quote from an insurance company, particularly car companies. You will almost always find a more competative quote on a comparison site. Even if you don't, give the insurers who don't publish on comparison sites a call; sometimes they are better. £1000 is a lot of money to simply accept as the cost of insurance.

Another issue with tethering is downloads you aren't aware of. You could think you aren't adding much of a load, just browsing Facebook, but in the background automatic Windows/Adobe/Chrome/Antivirus/etc. updates, Dropbox syncing, things like that all add up and your left with a drain some consumers wouldn't be aware of, so they'd get annoyed because they don't know why their service providers annoyed at them and it just aggravates everyone.

Sure, I'd be a massive fan of a network that was unlimited and allowed tethering but the quality of that network would rapidly degrade and their costs would spiral because in order to prevent abuse they'd only be able to have little more then a gentleman's agreement with users, whereas saying no tethering outright leaves you with the option of being able to detect people out to abuse the system more easily.",0,1362483265,null,0,false,0,c8q2t2h,t3_19o19d,t1_c8q2t2h,t1_c8pvjsz,null,1431488280,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So they gave you a renewal quote, what format was this? Email, letter or on the phone? When you accepted this was this in writing or on the phone? 
A guiding principle of British law is would an average man find it fair and reasonable. 
It would be reasonable to expect them to know of your claim as it was with their own company.  It would be reasonable for you to expect them to include this information when compiling the quote.  If you agreed the quote on this basis then it would be fair for them to let you out of the agreement. 
However, did they at any point send you details that needed to be checked?  If they did and it said anything like no accidents in the last 12 months or anything about No claims bonus being intact then they would argue it was reasonable for you to point this out. 
From the information you have given I'd say the additional charge is unreasonable and that someone screwed up but you shouldn't be held to something you agreed to at a very different price. 
Put it in writing you dispute the additional charge, Google the contact details of their board of directors and send it to all of them directly.  Check email format but probably first.last@.  
Don't be emotional in the email, just stick to the facts.  They will push this down into the company but you'll be going top down not bottom up.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There is no way to summarise everyone's thoughts, but from my own perspective they are just like everyone else here.

This is very true, all we can give is our opinions, but we must bear in mind that OP asked on reddit where the demographics are different. There are likely to be less unintelligent folk here than there are intelligent folk, because let's face it - how many chavs use reddit and come to /r/askuk? So most opinions here are going to be on the positive side of the spectrum.

That being said, I myself like to distinguish people on their worth as a person rather than their race, colour, or origin. I am of the crowd who realise that we're all the same animal really. Black cats, tabby cats, ginger cats, albino cats. They're all cats. We are all humans.

However, it does have to be said that there are some negative feelings in the UK (in my experience) about certain areas that are populated predominantly by minorities. 

Councils will often house people in communities close to other people of the same...what word can I use...nationality? Culture? Anyway, what you get here is a small area of let's say for example, Somalians, that are housed together, this then builds over the years as more people want to be near the people they know (""their own kind"" you may want to say).

What then happens, in my experience, is that the culture around the area changes a bit, as the community dictates the culture really, so you can tell differences between a community that is predominantly asian, a community that is predominantly african, or a community that is predominantly white.

I'm not trying to be racist here, or upset anyone by suggesting this, but just give an insight into the truth that we all know. We all know someone who is a bit racist, we've all had to put up with their comments. It does exist here in the UK but luckily, even most slightly-racist people are still polite, decent people. There are much less true racists, people that will actively go out of the way to do harm to others, but they do exist.

On the whole I am quite proud of the British culture, it's very varied and I do find that it makes life more interesting here. That being said I do wish there was more co-operation between different cultures here, namely with the religions. There is too much intolerance of other religions *by religious folk themselves*.

Also, whilst some of this post has been focused on lower class minorities, I do wish to point out that there is a terrible, terrible problem with white lower class people. You can how bad they are by watching TV programmes such as `People Like Us` on BBC, which focuses on a part of northern Manchester that shows how lowerclass life is.

I've digressed a lot, so I apologise, it's time for lunch and a cup of tea now.

I hope OP gets some insight from this post, and that no-one is offended!

I can understand the notion of sending your child to a Catholic school because it was better but this one makes it very hard to ignore the fact that first and foremost, it is a Catholic school. There are prayers in the morning, a weekly chapel service and whole-school masses in the Brompton Oratory for almost every popular feast day as well as vespers and benediction several times a year and at least 3 periods of compulsory RE a week until the age of 16. It's very strongly Catholic.

Clegg would also have been well aware of the fight that went on during the last decade over the interviewing of pupils to ""prove"" the Catholicism of them and their families. I'm pretty sure parliament had to pass something to stop it happening after the Oratory won in court.

I was a prefect during the first intake without the interviews and the deputy head spoke to me about things and I'd damn well bet they've found another way to weed people out of the application process.

Anyway, I've deviated massively but I don't understand why he gets a pass on this one, yet other politicians are crucified for not sticking to their political agendas at home.

I can't speak for the rest of the UK, but where I live (Dundee) it is a nightmare to get around the place if you want to walk or cycle, it's much easier to go by car. As a pedestrian, I have to take longer routes (I HATE those people-herding barriers at the sides of pavements!!) stand for ages at traffic lights inhaling all the exhaust fumes, and while we do have a cycle route, it only goes around the periphery of the city, so you have to go on main roads, and I've nearly been knocked off my bike on so many occasions I find going on the roads absolutely terrifying.

If we had cycle paths similar to what they have in Holland, it would be amazing, free, very low emissions (unless I ate beans for tea the night before!) and so very good for your body and your mind.

I also think health goes much further than what you eat and how often you work out. It's a state of being, of having a contented mind, a feeling of self-worth, of being part of your community, feeling validated, and looking towards the good in life.

The way these health issues are approached in the press feels a bit allegorical to me, healthy living being 'good' and obesity/depression/addiction being 'evil', so that when they suggest raising taxes on these things to 'combat' them, it's more like a punishment to those who 'self-abuse' than any serious attempt to improve things.

**Companion of Honour**  
A major contribution to the arts, science, medicine, or government lasting over a long period of time.

**Knight/Dame (i.e. Sir... Dame... so-and-so)**  
A major contribution in any activity, usually at national level. Other people working in the nominee’s area will see their contribution as inspirational and significant, requiring commitment over a long period of time.


**Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)**  
A prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.

**Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)**  
A major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area.

**Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)**  
A significant achievement or outstanding service to the community. An MBE is also awarded for local ‘hands-on’ service which stands out as an example to other people.

**British Empire Medal (BEM)**  
Reintroduced in 2012, this rewards a sustained, local contribution or innovative, high-impact work of a relatively short duration (eg 3 to 4 years).

But we are still in a depression. We have public funding cuts everywhere and many people outside of prison can't find jobs. Instead of paying a prisoner to do a minimum wage job with public funds, wouldn't it be a more popular choice to use the same public funds to pay normal unemployed people a minimum wage to do the same job?

Which is to be fair saying you views might not be the truth and I'll admit I'd likely have been less short with you if it was the case. I just know a lot of people in bands and I've been to a lot of gigs and it's annoying when people make out all bands to be as dicky as some bands.

Didn't he score the winning goal in the FA Cup '01 against Arsenal with his left? Gerrard also has a pretty decent left foot but it's definitely nowhere near his right foot in terms of shooting, I remember always seeing him try to shift onto his right foot for that magical shot of his.

I agree with you though, some players are pretty good even though their weaker foot is either crap or utterly useless (Antonio Valencia, anyone?) but I think in Suso's case, if he wants to play that 10 role (for us) that he plays for the Spain U21s, he'll have to be like, really good with both feet. That playmaking role usually requires you to be adept with both feet, poking a pass to let someone in on goal quickly. There's just no time to shift onto your stronger foot, the opportunity would have been gone by then. He does use his right foot rather well this game, hope he can keep it up. The first team games we've seen him in, his right foot is just meh, really.
