true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"Posted this in the other post about him but...

Holtby's strength is in an attacking mid/playmaker role. He is not a deep lying playmaker. He excels at finding space and has a killer final ball. As onesimo_wizard said Holtby has a knack for popping up in the hole and setting up goals. He has killer movement and vision in the final third. I repeat...he is not a deep lying playmaker and rarely is asked to play in that type of role for Schalke 04. I'm not sure where you're getting the impression that he is a deep lying playmaker. He was poorly utilized last year when he was asked to play alongside Jones in the midfield and that is certainly part of the reason Schalke signed Neustadter a more defensive minded possession type midfielder. Holtby can certainly put in a tackle if need be (Schalke focuses on pressing the ball and setting up counters) but he is better utilized in attack. That is not really their style of play. Schalke tends to counter hard and fast on the outside using the speed of Farfan / Draxler / Fuchs / Afellay / etc or with fairly direct play forward. They have some solid ball winners in Jones / Neustadter with the occasional appearance from Hoger. Holtby will link up with the guys on the outside or either Jones / Neustadter with a quick outlet through ball. He pops up in support of Huntelaar and causes overloads on opposition's backs and sucks them out which allows Huntelaar (poacher) to sneak in behind. 

IMHO he would be an excellent signing for Spurs and would link up well with Ade or a poacher type like Defoe (mini Huntelaar). He also has a great deal of experience in playing in a system that makes great use of pace on the outsides which we certainly have in Bale and Lennon and is even more effective when he has ball winners that quickly look to feed him or to speed on the outside allowing him to make dangerous runs. I'm hoping we sign him. He's a great young talent.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Questioning the definition of canonical aside this is mostly right with some errors.

Pythia never gave the TLs immortality, she just cursed them. It was Rassilon who invented all that stuff (Zagreus) and the Other's motive for getting out isn't exactly as this post implies. It seemed more that Rassilon depended on the Other for advice and the Other wanted to leave but knew that if he did Rassilon would gain complete political control.

Also, the Doctor wasn't ""born"". He is described as being loomed with the belly button defect that gives him the nickname of Wormhole/Snail.

The Doctor's motives for leaving TL society are mixed. It could be because he got tired of them, or it could be that he had to leave because Glospin was discovering the secret of his genetics, or it could be the assassin Burner who was going to kill the Doctor...depends on which expanded universe material you consult and The Infinity Doctors and Cold Fusion just makes it harder.

Susan wasn't wandering the streets half starved, she was staying with a family in hiding because ofthe riots. I don't remember anything about a spaceport.

And the Doctor WAS confused when he met her but did eventually accept it. And the Hand of Omega
was never returned to present day Gallifrey. In fact, it's implied in the 7th Doctor story Remembrance of the Daleks that he hid it on earth and then, in that story, retrieved it as the 7th Doctor.

And nowhere does it say that the Other/Doctor is an ""immortal demi-god"" who isn't bound by the normal laws of regeneration.

If Lungbarrow is the only source that poster used, there are some errors and it also does not take into account the other alternative media besides the book Lungbarrow. If you count the books you count the other EU stuff.

edit: So what is the Doctor's real name? Other? I don't really think that's a name either.

**EDIT**: Pulling out my copy of Lungbarrow I see that when the Doctor meets Susan he says, ""Nonsense, child. Grandfather indeed! I've never seen you before in my life!"" But that the Other *did* send Susan away on an Astrafoil to Tersurus which she didn't take. The Other never found this out but that's why the first Doctor is able to encounter Susan at this point. She is hiding out with her family. Pg 279

**Further EDIT**: Yeah I should also mention as that author is bringing Human Nature into this that the whole ""obliquely implies"" thing is basically the human Doctor, John Smith, writing a fictional story about a Victorian who invents time travel and brings it to the savage Gallifreyans. Which is clearly John Smith's WW1 self and his real Doctor self merging together from his subconscious in this fictional story.

The EU does apply to internal trade though in the way to ensure that it is the same level as intra-EU trade. One of these things is standards so recertification isn't needed every time you ship something across a border.

Yes, when a new regulation comes out, it becomes a bit of a scramble to implement it across the EU but it comes out of the European Privacy Directive which on the whole seems like a good thing. I actually have worked with EU regulations and generally they have been useful, directives though have to be implemented with local legislation which may be overdone.

&gt;this absolutely doesn't imply that EU should have power to dictate, e.g, how we sell houses.

You have me worried there? I am not aware of any EU rules on how houses are sold. As a British person living in Germany and owning a home there, the rules are very national (we don't have those energy efficiency certificates that they have in the UK now) but that does not stop me moving around.

Politicians will always seek to place the blame elsewhere for unpopular legislation. In Germany, the states who have a lot of legislative power will blame the federal level and in the UK, they tend to blame the EU.",0,1357276171,null,0,false,0,c7qqxp8,t3_15wamt,t1_c7qqxp8,t1_c7qkf9f,null,1430850961,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The claim is also that ""illegal settlers"" don't get to have a say in these sorts of matters. 

Same goes for the Falklands.

1. Strax hands were not  shown in the scene prior to Clara making her statement.

2. The scene was not continuous. There was a bit of time left out during which  Clara got out of the carriage and Strax went for the worm a second time. During this period of time Strax would have had the opportunity to put on the gauntlet without any viewer seeing.

Of course, the Doctor would have been able to tell as easily as Clara  that Strax did not have on the gauntlet.  That the Doctor let Strax attempt to to get the worm a second time without interference might have mislead an observant viewer into thinking that Strax did, indeed, have a gauntlet on. 

Most viewers have a high enough opinion of the Doctor that they would believe he would have seen to it that Strax put on the gauntlet. After all this would be the second retrieval attempt, given the abject failure of the first. The situation was similar to when Roger Rabbit couldn't get out of the handcuffs when expected -- he could only do it when it was funny.

Moffat is a clever writer and clever writers using ambiguity to keep their reader (or in this case, viewers) guessing.  And sometimes these clever writers make bold and true statements, then use ambiguity to make them seem exaggerations or mistakes.  After all, when Amy said she was pregnant and then not pregnant.

&gt;In December 2009 the United Kingdom became the first European country to deploy high definition content using the new DVB-T2 transmission standard, as specified in the Digital TV Group (DTG) D-book, on digital terrestrial television. The Freeview HD service currently contains 4 HD channels and was rolled out region by region across the UK in accordance with the digital switchover process, finally being completed in October 2012. However, Freeview HD has not been the first HDTV service over digital terrestrial television in Europe; for example, in Italy the Rai HD channel started broadcasting in 1080i on April 24, 2008 using the older DVB-T transmission standard.

EDIT: And by that I just mean the transition away from Standard definition broadcasts. As recent as 2009 the fine tuning of the broadcast systems have still been taking place. It is likely the filming of the show was adhering to the quality of the average television, broadcasting in 480i, then moving to 720p, then 1080p.

The EU does not charge duty on IP or services. It does not stop the UK from selling to these places now.

As for IP, that is weak stick to hold against the lesser developed countries, they can just copy. Even China is only weakly enforcing IP laws and as processes are outsourced, they are copied. Services is a funny one. Unless your staff are substantially cheaper, you need feet on the ground. This works well for English speaking economies with cheap labour costs selling to the UK but less well the other way around.

Some high end services can be sold direct. Unfortunately, countries such as India demand that if you establish a local enterprise, you have to give locals a substantial share.

What the EU does do is to offer the so-called ""Banking"" passport. This means that if you are a registered and regulated financial institution in one EU country, you can operate in all of them (subject to certain additional restrictions on retail such as local depositor protection regs). Many banks have chosen to base themselves in London as there is nothing stopping them trading directly in Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Paris and retaining their lucrative clearing rights.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"i'm confused about our transfer dealings now. if we were going for an out-and-out central striker there must have been someone out there with a better pedigree than sturridge. on the other hand, if we were looking for a player to play in the position sterling or downing currently occupy he looks a perefect fit.

Here's why i think this is a bad idea:

Moving Suarez away from his most effective areas of the pitch. It's nice to talk about free roles but the reality is that the wide forward has to support the full back when we don't have the ball. That puts him deep in his own half when we regain possession, and restricted to a particular side. While at the moment he genuinely has a free role where he can isolate either wide defender (second goal on wednesday), drop into the hole (first goal) or make a run through the middle (third goal). When we win the ball and move it forward quickly, who do you want doing these things, Suarez or Sturridge?

It's messing with an attacking system that has produced good results in the last few matches. Our goals scored since december reads something like 1,3,1,4,1,3,3. Moving sturridge up top looks like a more traditional system where the striker plays highest and relies on the midfielders/wide men to play him in. It could work, but I don't see a reason to change from the system that we've been developing all season and has just started to produce the goods going forward.

Sturridge looks a great fit for the wide forward position. Look at the goal sterling scored on wednesday, and the chance he missed.

You also have to admit he has more defensive ability than most CAMs.  When I say he's a deep lying playmaker, I don't mean like Xabi Alonso with the long passes.  He can definitely attack, but he'll attack out of the CM position for us, not CAM.  Remember that AVBs preferred 4-3-3 doesn't even use a CAM, but instead a DM and 2 CMs. If we sign him we'd have Sandro and Parker as our DMs/ball winners, Dembele and Holtby as our link up/playmaker mids, and Dempsey/Siggy as CAMs.

I think it's important to note that a true CAM would clog the middle of the pitch, and prevent Bale and Lennon from moving into the center of the pitch on their attacking runs.

You mean colour *film* to go in a camera.  And yes, they did have, but there was no point because newspapers were still printed in black and white.  Back then the unions controlled the print industry and fought against any kind of modernisation, lest jobs were lost.  So newspapers were still typeset using hot lead.

It wasn't until after the [Wapping dispute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping_dispute) starting in 1986 that newspapers started using computers, page layout software and modern printing processes.

News correspondents traditionally shot on black and white film because it was arty and there was no point shooting in colour.  As a side-effect, it's also much easier to develop B&amp;W photography than colour.  It might have been the difference between being able to develop pictures in a hotel room in a war zone or not.

None of this was actually true, and the phone call was made by a fellow university student of Dia's to Souness, suggesting that he should give Dia a chance with Southampton. Souness was convinced, and signed Dia on a one-month contract.

&gt;Dia played just one game for Southampton [...]. He came on as a substitute for Matthew Le Tissier after 32 minutes, but was later substituted himself after playing for 53 minutes; Leeds won the match 2–0.

true,DRW_,uk,"Derbyshire, United Kingdom","&gt;As for IP, that is weak stick to hold against the lesser developed countries, they can just copy. Even China is only weakly enforcing IP laws and as processes are outsourced, they are copied. Services is a funny one. Unless your staff are substantially cheaper, you need feet on the ground. This works well for English speaking economies with cheap labour costs selling to the UK but less well the other way around.
&gt;

So why aren't they? Why are ARM processors the largest in the world (in regards to shipped numbers) if companies like China can just copy them? (I'll give you a hint: It doesn't work like you think it does).

You're massively oversimplifying what is involved in these areas and the areas they cover. 

The problem with the advanced economies is not losing out on the cheap manufacturing China does, it is stagnating education that isn't training people to work in jobs that countries like China cannot compete in.

There is a reason companies like China, Indonesia, Brazil, India, etc, don't excel in these areas, and there is a reason countries like the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, etc, excel in others - we're far better placed to produce and provide stuff that requires the highly skilled engineering, the services, the IP, etc.

Which is why I laugh at the ridiculous idea at trying to bring back these low skilled, low wage manufacturing jobs into these 'advanced' economies. That isn't how your economy grows, it is how you stagnate and eventually start to shrink.

Those urns were artworks left over from the era. Doesn't matter that the pictures were of sports stars. The point is that the *artistic representations* of the sports stars are what we keep and cherish. Plenty of artists today take great photos and paint great portraits of famous contemporary people. I believe this should be continued.

Don't forget that galleries and museums are curated, they have an awful lot of stuff in storage with which they can use to represent an era or trend. There were other artists who painted the non-famous people and [everyday life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peasant_Wedding) of the era.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Contracts are not always cheaper - it depends very strongly on your usage patterns. To give you an example (based on my current phone setup):

I have an £10/month T-Mobile SIM-only contract (1 month notice period); it has 500MB mobile data, but no charge for exceeding that limit (just slowdown of service), and more minutes and texts than I use (100 of each). My current phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus) cost me £330 to buy in a high street store; I could have saved £30 on that by ordering it online and waiting a couple of days for it to arrive.

To get an equivalent deal in terms of handset and tariff, I could have signed up to a 24 month contract at £30/month, or an 18 month contract at £35/month. Granted, both contracts included more texts and minutes (500 minutes, unlimited texts), but I don't use all of my existing allowance, so the increase has no value to me.

Do the TCO maths - my phone + contract costs me £570 over 24 months, or £23.75/month. Over 18 months, I'd pay £510, or £28.34/month; in both cases, the ""free"" phone ends up costing me more. Plus, by going for a separate phone and contract, I'm free to change tariff freely if my situation changes (I could, for example, port to a prepay SIM today if £10/month became a burden, or shift to a more expensive tariff if my usage increases).

Now, this maths doesn't apply to everyone - if your usage is higher than mine, you'd be paying more for a SIM-only contract; however, given the money I spent, a SIM-only contract of up to £16/month and an up-front £330 for a phone is cheaper than an £330 phone ""free"" on an £30/month 24 month contract, or an £35/month 18 month contract.

""Tbf there's next to no chance of conflict, even if only because the Argentine armed forces are something equivalent to a child's toy soldier set nowadays.""

And as a Serviceman currently out in the Falklands right now, I am saying that there is next to no chance of a 'war' breaking out. It's just a bit of childish fun poking at the Argentinians and getting them riled up before the referendum in March which will rebuke ol' Cristina for a little while.

In a newspaper with only 50'000 readers out of a possible 41 million, I don't think the 'backlash' from this will be anything other than a few disgruntled groans from the readers, and a few more who hear about the letter in other newspapers.

To be honest, whilst the Sun aren't in the right, they certainly aren't in as much wrong as a select few are making them out to be, nor is this that much of an issue that everyone needs to start hiding under our tables for fear of bombs flying overhead.

You're twisted because 5 year olds cannot consent to sex and sex without consent is deeply psychologically damaging. Not to mention sex with a 5 year old is going to be physically damaging too.

Nice middle class parents would react with murderous violence if you acted on your urges or even if you admitted you had them. My brother's girlfriend said she would 'torture' a dog that had savaged a baby (she has &lt;6 month old baby) and you should have no illusions that people would do the same thing to you.

Now that murderous violence would be illegal but I would argue it is not immoral. Everyone has the right to avoid rape and I would ague to kill people attempting to rape them. Since five year olds are not physically able to defend themselves against monsters like you parents have a right to defend them.

No you may say that this is twisted. But the thing is that morality is just something the majority decides on and you're in a distinct minority on this point. Indeed the consensus on murderous violence against paedophiles is I believe a biological adaptation aimed at getting rid of that minority.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; Obviously there is a difference between actual genetic modification and selective breeding.

I know I'm preaching to the converted here, but I think the argument that we shouldn't use it at all is undermined by the fact that, when it comes to selective breeding, we don't really have a clue what we're doing (""select that bull to be a breeder, it has the biggest testicles"", ""that plant is taller which must mean its better, only use seeds from plants above 2 metres tall""). When these processes are validated they are done so with one or two generations of experimentation and next to no knowledge of the underlying genetic changes. At absolute best it is a process determined by someone roughly known probability of a phenotype being expressed. 

As a result, we have completely destroyed the genetic diversity of our crops; there used to be thousands of kinds of wheat, now there are a few hundred. There are also cases where pathogens destroy crops because of this, blight is a classic example of human intervention when we didn't have a clue because of market demand. GM is the first step into actually improving our understanding.

&gt; You can't introduce, for example, human genes into a tomato with selective breeding. You can with GM and this is something that a lot of people are concerned about.

Interestingly, crops engineered to produce pharmaceutics is a really promising line of research that could bring drug production costs right down as well as giving chemists new ways to synthesis compounds.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; It's nice to talk about free roles but the reality is that the wide forward has to support the full back when we don't have the ball.

They don't necessarily - at Real Madrid, Ronaldo tracks back fuck-all, and yes there are games where this creates an issue and opponents target it, but for the most part the team accommodates this. The upside of it is that by staying high up the field, Ronaldo becomes a very potent weapon on the counter-attack, an area of our game under Rodgers which has been improving recently.

But also, Suarez doesn't have to play as a wide forward - he could easily play behind the main striker centrally, where Shelvey/Henderson/Suso have played most of the time this season; he'd certainly do much better than any of them, and he wouldn't have to track back as much because of the presence of two midfielders behind him. Playing in this central role would also mean he has the same freedom of movement, and it means he can assist someone other than himself while still scoring a fair few goals (he's scored a good number of goals from the area just outside the box, after all)

&gt; It's messing with an attacking system that has produced good results in the last few matches. Our goals scored since december reads something like 1,3,1,4,1,3,3. 

Almost universally against weaker teams; Fulham, Sunderland and QPR are not the same level of challenge as United, Arsenal, or even West Brom or Everton.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I'll have a shot at this.

Reina, Johnson, Skrtel, Agger, Enrique, Lucas, Allen, Gerrard, Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge

Bench: Jones/New keeper, Coates/Kelly, Wisdom, Henderson, Suso/New attacking midfielder, Downing/New winger (or inside forward)/Assaidi (if he becomes good enough in 6 months), Borini

I think either Coates or Kelly would suffice, Kelly's supposed to be a CB anyway. So is Wisdom, but he can play more of a defensive full back (Kelly's a lot more offensive), could come in handy when we play Suarez on his side, so that Suarez doesn't have to track back so often.

I don't know if Downing will stay, but if he keeps up his form and stuff, he'll definitely make the bench or be a legit contender for a starting place.  If he goes, we'll probably bring in another winger (Ince?) and he'll probably be good enough to make the starting eleven. Assaidi might make it if he starts getting better, he's not even making the bench right now (but with Cole gone now, who knows?)

I'm pretty sure Suso won't make the bench ahead of a proper No. 10, he (Suso) needs a little bit more development and stuff. He's not like Sterling, who has age as one of his strengths, allowing him to speed past players, etc. But for now I guess I'll throw him in there.

And yes, I haven't put Shelvey in there. I think he might need a loan somewhere or something like that. He's not very technically skilled (first touch, finishing, questionable to say the least) but he's pretty intelligent with his runs and has a good shot in him. He doesn't seem to be very necessary/effective in Rodgers system anyway, he's not one of those guys like Gerrard/Allen/Henderson/Lucas to sit back and pass the ball around, patiently waiting for an opportunity. He tries to make shit happen. So, I don't think a loan would screw him over too hard when it comes to fitting into our system, because he doesn't at the moment, anyway.

That has to be team that starts. Wisdom can't go up against Evra and Young, he'd get ripped apart. Robinson is more than capable than dealing with Valencia and Rafael, in fact he'd probably be better at pushing them back, which is what we need to do this game. Contain the flanks, and use Hendo or Lucas to shut off Carrick. Strangle United's forward play and let Gerrard, Suarez and Sturridge off the leash.

Downing gets in over Sterling purely because of experience, I think he'd give Rafael a bit more of a headache than Sterling would because he's shown quite a bit of guile in the last few games.

If Lucas is the player assigned to Carrick, then Hendo becomes our most important midfield asset in the attack. He's quicker than Gerrard these days, so he has to be the one that stretches the fragile United midfield line. If he makes the space and gets enough of the ball, United will be forced to react by bringing on Scholes (if he didn't start) and let Carrick drop back to the base of the midfield. This stops much of United's forward threat and we can then concentrate on penetrating Evans and Vidic.

true,alister667,lfc68,,"I think it'll be good, I'm feeling optimistic and here's why!

1) Sturridge has pace. 
Defenders can try to play a high line against Luis, but with Sturridge lurking they'll be vulnerable to through balls, played behind them, for Sturridge to run onto. If they stay deeper to nullify the threat from pace, they'll give Luis more room to get the ball and get turned. Their skills compliment each other. This is exactly the sort of player Luis was bought to play alongside.

2) The front 3 positionally need to be flexible.
The front 3 in Rodger's system tend to 'float' more, it's not really about playing Luis out wide (like a traditional winger), he'll be free to move around much more, and he'll be central enough to get plenty of chances to score. 

3) Sturridge can play out wide if needed.
If he doesn't work out playing as a central striker, we can move Luis back in and play Sturridge outside of him and use his pace that way. Rodgers has already stated than no player can come to Liverpool and demand where he will play. 

4) He's a decent finisher, with good technique. I remember being very impressed with him at Bolton, I suspect with decent run in the team, and some great teammates to supply the bullets he'll start scoring.

Having said all that I'm hopelessly optimistic anyhow, I remember being genuinely excited when Joe Cole was signed for 100k a week! I don't believe our attack is so good we shouldn't be messing about with it. I think Sturridge and the return of Borini will only strengthen us up front where we desperately need options.

Here's one from last month:

&gt;The European Space Agency (Esa) investment will lift UK's contribution to the Paris-based organisation by an average of 30% at a time when many other nations are struggling to meet their contributions or even reducing them. 

&gt;By increasing its contribution, the expectation is that the UK will get more research contracts in return and this will increase the competitiveness of British space companies, enabling them to win future orders in what is a growing global market for products and services. 

&gt;Recent data have shown that the UK space industry recorded a total turnover of over £9.1bn in 2010/11, representing an average annual growth rate of 7.5% since 2008/09. 

&gt;While other sectors have shrunk during the recession, these figures gave Science Minister David Willetts powerful ammunition to persuade the Treasury to back space as a key sector for further growth.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"&gt; They don't necessarily - at Real Madrid, Ronaldo tracks back fuck-all, and yes there are games where this creates an issue and opponents target it, but for the most part the team accommodates this. The upside of it is that by staying high up the field, Ronaldo becomes a very potent weapon on the counter-attack, an area of our game under Rodgers which has been improving recently.

Pretty much every wide player we've used this season has been tasked with tracking back. Sterling does it, Downing does it, Enrique did it, Borini did it (the only one who didn't really was Suso and Wisdom was left badly exposed against everton). Clearly Brendan feels the advantages of tracking back outweigh the disadvantages otherwise he would have had Sterling/Downing etc staying high up the pitch too. Even so we've been vulnerable to fast counter-attacks, so unless we're happy with us being even more vulnerable than we already are the wide men need to keep tracking back, whether it's Suarez or Sturridge.

&gt;But also, Suarez doesn't have to play as a wide forward - he could easily play behind the main striker centrally, where Shelvey/Henderson/Suso have played most of the time this season; he'd certainly do much better than any of them, and he wouldn't have to track back as much because of the presence of two midfielders behind him. Playing in this central role would also mean he has the same freedom of movement, and it means he can assist someone other than himself while still scoring a fair few goals (he's scored a good number of goals from the area just outside the box, after all)

So 4-4-2, or 4-4-1-1? Fair enough, it's an option, as long as the two central mids were hard working, strong and stayed deep. I'd prefer this to 4-3-3 with Suarez out wide.

&gt;Almost universally against weaker teams; Fulham, Sunderland and QPR are not the same level of challenge as United, Arsenal, or even West Brom or Everton.

Fine, but you still have to create the chances and finish them. This is the same QPR that chelsea failed to score against, and the same sunderland that beat man city.

&gt;But Sturridge doesn't track back at all, so how does that fit with your earlier point?

What do you mean doesn't? If he's told to (as Sterling/Donwing etc presumably also are), he'll have to, otherwise he shouldn't be picked. Same with Suarez. Maybe Brendan is happy with allowing one wide player to not track back, but it seems unlikely based on the season so far.",0,1357304939,null,0,false,0,c7qvjc6,t3_15x0mb,t1_c7qvjc6,t1_c7qv5cp,null,1430853189,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Pretty much every wide player we've used this season has been tasked with tracking back. 

I know that, I'm just saying that it *is* possible to do otherwise and still succeed.

&gt; Clearly Brendan feels the advantages of tracking back outweigh the disadvantages otherwise he would have had Sterling/Downing etc staying high up the pitch too.

It varies based on the player - maybe Rodgers reckons the advantages of keeping Sterling/Downing high up the pitch aren't as significant as they would be with Suarez, and I'd agree with him given that neither of those two are anywhere near as threatening. After all, Madrid allow Ronaldo to do it, not just any old winger.

&gt; Even so we've been vulnerable to fast counter-attacks

Our vulnerability to counter-attacks is based on multiple things - you're right that wingers tracking back helps against counter-attacks, but there's other issues as well that need to be solved, and if those issues are solved then it's possible to defend against counterattacks consistently without both wingers tracking back. Those other issues include occasions when the entire midfield ends up out of position, players making inappropriate passes especially in our own half, and players not covering when others move forward (e.g. when Agger attacked against Sunderland and then they broke and Lucas/Johnson hadn't dropped back to fill Agger's area).

&gt; So 4-4-2, or 4-4-1-1? Fair enough, it's an option, as long as the two central mids were hard working, strong and stayed deep. I'd prefer this to 4-3-3 with Suarez out wide.

These are just numbers; 4-4-1-1 and 4-2-3-1 are both legitimate descriptions of how we've played recently, and there are various versions of the 4-3-3. But basically, yes, I think our most likely new use of Suarez will be in the ""attacking midfield"" role behind the striker, playing centrally, rather than out wide.

&gt; Fine, but you still have to create the chances and finish them. This is the same QPR that chelsea failed to score against, and the same sunderland that beat man city.

Agreed, but I'm just saying that our ""attacking system"" isn't really being the massive success it's been hailed to be over recent games because it still lacks significant goal threat against teams that aren't languishing in the bottom 5 of the table (and sometimes even those that are; Aston Villa really wasn't that long ago).

&gt; What do you mean doesn't? If he's told to (as Sterling/Donwing etc presumably also are), he'll have to, otherwise he shouldn't be picked. 

I'm sure it's an area of his game that Rodgers will look to develop because there will be times that he is played out wide - but in his career thus far he has shown a propensity to not track back. He never did for AVB at Chelsea, and one of the reasons he was dropped by Di Matteo in his caretaker spell was that he didn't track back from wide areas, and that didn't suit Chelsea's reversion to ""sit-deep-and-counter-attack-with-Drogba"".

&gt;  Maybe Brendan is happy with allowing one wide player to not track back, but it seems unlikely based on the season so far.

Again I'd say because he hasn't had a wide player worth indulging in that regard. Should Suarez or Sturridge play out wide, we'd have a player who poses enough of an attacking threat to allow them to not track back as much. Newcastle do it with Ben Arfa as well, because he's worth the concession. 

Either way, I really expect Suarez to play centrally behind Sturridge, so the whole ""wide men track back"" thing may be irrelevant.",0,1357306304,null,0,false,0,c7qvqld,t3_15x0mb,t1_c7qvqld,t1_c7qvjc6,null,1430853287,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

As far as I am aware this happens at most clubs loads of the time, it is just that other clubs train in private so there are no photos to print for them juicy headlines.

The two are totally different. If someone loses their job, they don't have to keep paying a student loan as you do with a bank loan. There are no contractual monthly payments like a personal loan. In fact, unless you start earning *good* money, then it's barely even noticeable.

To say that it would put people off even going to uni because they can't afford the tuition makes as much sense to me as saying that the 40% tax rate puts people off working: it won't affect those on a low wage, it isn't payable if you lose your job, it comes out before you get paid, you don't start paying until you're earning a fairly good wage and it's not even really noticeable until you're earning a pretty good wage.

For me personally, I just didn't want to wait. Like I said above, I have a flagship phone, I shouldn't be waiting longer than three months for an update. I also like CyanogenMod far more than Sense, although the camera on Sense is far better because HTC don't allow third-party software to access the image processing chip that does all the fancy stuff.

If you like TouchWiz, and you know your phone is definitely getting JB, there's not much real need to root, at least in my opinion. It's a year or so down the line when Android 5 comes out, that's when you could consider giving it a whirl. 

Also as a tip, rooting and flashing are two different things, you don't have to flash a ROM when you root, but you need to root to flash a ROM. You can root your phone, install an app to backup everything (apart from system apps), wipe the phone to flash the new ROM on and then reinstall the app and restore all your apps+settings.",0,1357311188,null,0,false,0,c7qwnk8,t3_15vt0u,t1_c7qwnk8,t1_c7qwjp7,null,1430853728,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

true,samsaBEAR,null,null,"Rooting doesn't no, it just essentially makes you an Admin on your phone and allows you to install third-party software. Flashing is basically installing the software, and when going between different ROMs, a full wipe is required just in case things with the old ROM don't get on with things on the new ROM. You can make a backup of the original though, which is also recommended, just in case the install goes wrong and you need to restore.

It can and it can't, it purely depends on the ROM at hand. Honestly, the battery life on my phone dropped a bit when I installed CyanogenMod, but I charge my phone up every night so it wasn't that bad. Downsides are that it voids your warranty straight away. Annoyingly for me I rooted before finding out about a WiFi problem my phone has (that the phone shipped with), and o2 wanted £180 to fix this problem. Also, the ROM you move onto might not have features you like from the one you came from. HTC Sense has little quirks that I do miss, but the speed of Jelly Bean more than makes up for that.

The most used app is Titanium Backup. The reason you don't backup or restore system apps is that they are the kind of ones that come with the phone, so like the stock messaging app in TouchWiz. That won't work with a new ROM, and trying to install it may cause problems.

so the 'kill the gays bill' was never 'effective genocide', and by the time this guy spoke it certainly was no longer a 'kill anyone' bill.

The Vanquis card (39.9% APR) would cost me £20.17/month over 24 months, making paying upfront for the phone + my contract slightly more than the 24 month contract (£30.17/month as compared to a flat £30/month).

The Barclaycard Initial (29.9% APR) would cost £18.43/month over 24 months; if you have no credit history, this implies that borrowing on a credit card to pay for the phone and then buying service separately will save you £1.57/month, if your usage is similar to mine.

The John Lewis Partnership card (16.9% APR) would cost £16.30. Someone with my needs from the network would save money this way, and would have around £4/month available to pay excess use charges if they use a small amount more than me.

I didn't start watching many professional matches, but I was much more aware of the sport. I played growing up and was a referee in high school, but I quit due to evil screaming parents (yes your son was in an offside position and yes the ball really did cross the goal line).

I did attend one MLS match out in San Jose, but that stadium is a nightmare to get in and out of and I never went back. Similarly, I did the same thing for the Red Bulls and it was such a pain getting on to a train at the end of the game, that I haven't gone back there yet either.

I watched a bunch of the Euro 2012 matches on TV and decided that I would make an effort to watch premier league matches once the season rolled around. 

As to why I picked Tottenham: I saw them when the came to the US in 2010 to play the San Jose Earthquakes, which was the first time I ever got to see an EPL team live. Then I moved across the country and saw them play the Red Bulls in New Jersey before this season started.

Also, they have by far the best logo. It's a bird sitting on an old soccer ball. What does it mean? I have no idea, but I like it. I could root for any team that puts a bird on a soccer ball. Maybe I should make a list of teams that do this, Crystal Palace seems to, for instance. =)

And the hardest thing to understand about the sport and Spurs....

1. The tactics and strategy, formations, how formations affect/are related to strategy. (i.e. Tottenham has been playing a lot of 4-4-2 lately, why does that matter, compared to a team playing a 4-5-1? What type of strategy are you employing when you make that decision? What types of players do you need to be successful choosing a different formation? How important is it, and do teams need to adjust based on how their opponents play?)

2. Spurs specific: how to refer to them. Apparently saying 'The Spurs' will get me yelled at, even though that's 100% fine for American sports teams. I usually stick with Tottenham to be safe.

I've heard a lot of people talking about our front three as if they were a lone striker and two wingers, and it's as if they haven't been watching the games.

Rodgers sets us up with a highly mobile no 9 and either inverted wingers (Downing on the right, for example) or players more in the inside forward role. Width comes from the full-backs.

There have been departures from this, of course; Downing prefers to stay wide and Johnson's happy to come inside, but this comes from not really having the right players for the system available. Even if one of the front 3 is providing width, the third guy has to stick near Suarez or else he's isolated.

To say that  players in the front three either the central striker or 'stuck out wide' is just plain wrong. We don't, in general, use true wingers at all, and we *never* use two at once.

Sturridge, like Suarez, is very mobile. I expect them to line up with Sturridge most central, in a role that's not quite a typical no 9 but more of a Thierry Henry-style where he approaches the box from different directions. Suarez will be buzzing around and behind him, looking to play him in or exploit the gaps Sturridge's movement will create, with Sterling or Downing in the third position, trying to find some space in wider areas on either side of the pitch (but not hugging the touchline).

I think Rodgers is kidding a bit when he says it's either one up and two wingers or a narrow three; it doesn't need to be symmetrical and he knows that. We can play with one winger swapping sides, and as long as the full backs are clear on which one stays and which one goes, create an overload on whichever side of the pitch the opposition is weakest. That's surely the goal, once we have our own house in order and have the midfield ticking properly to create the platform.",0,1357316076,null,0,false,0,c7qxw6k,t3_15wxlr,t1_c7qxw6k,t3_15wxlr,null,1430854297,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

As it stands on your budget, I'd recommend waiting just a little bit (and possible saving £20 more while you're at it). The reason being that Nokia will soon be releasing the [Lumia 620](http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia620). WhatsApp is on it, Skype is on it, Office is on it - very handy if you're a student or work in at a desk. Add to that Nokia Maps which allows downloading of maps so you can get turn by turn directions throughout Europe, and you've got easily the most fully-featured smartphone on a budget. Expandable storage (can put in a 64 GB SDXC card) means you'll have enough storage for as much music / podcasts / videos as you'll ever need in a handheld gadget.


Another plus point which is never worth overlooking is the fact it's a Nokia. They have a lot of impressive tech built into their smartphones (even this one has the ClearBlack screen, with deeper blacks than other phones in the same price bracket). Removable covers seem small, but if you're prone to scratching, or just love customisation, it turns into a great feature.


It's been given a retail price of $250 before tax and subsidies, so it should retail for about £160-170 here.


And the best part? Guaranteed updates for 18 months.

For example, I have Aspergers, and as a result of that chronic stress-related issues and clinical depression. As a result, I simply cannot maintain a fixed daily schedule. It's pretty routine that I can't sleep for several days. That means when I do sleep, it's not at a fixed regular time, and it tends not to be for a nice neat 6 or 7 hours.

That's not laziness. It's a medical condition, plus at least in part the consequences of the long term victimization I've suffered from people who think I'm just lazy or that a medical condition could be magically cured with the right incentives. Actually, it's also partly the side-effect of the actions I've taken in the past trying to fix my problems for my self. Trying to fix problems that cannot be fixed is a significant stress issue.

BTW - for most of my life I didn't know I had Aspergers, but I still had it. I couldn't explain why I had my problems, just try to find rationalizations. No wonder it all sounded like excuses.

And one thing about trying to explain why you can't do things when you can't know why - eventually you stop trying to explain (learned helplessness). Or you end up accepting what you're told, assuming that you must just be lazy and evil exactly as people say you are, and since any attempt to change that must fail (the underlying problem is still there) you just go with it (learned helplessness again).

Inability to get up in the morning is actually quite strongly correlated to clinical depression and other mental disorders.

According to the Chelsea Wikia, we have had 12* Club Captains. (Many more have worn the armband and the *Club Captain list is incomplete)

Of those 12, all but one (Marcel Desailly of Ghana) have been from the United Kingdom. 

John Terry: London, England

Marcel Desailly: Accra, Ghana

Steve Clarke: Saltcoats, Scotland

Denny Wise: London, England

Colin Pates: London, England

Ray Wilkins: Middlesex, England

Ron Harris: London, England

Terry Venables: London, England

Roy Bentley: Bristol, England

John Harris: Glasgow, Scotland

Tommy Law: Glasgow, Scotland

Jack Harrow: Mitcham, England

Hence, my saying of English Club, English Captain. 3/4 of our Club Captains have been English and all but 1 hail from the U.K. itself.

Jay Bothroyd has been with QPR since 2011 and was a free signing.
DJ Campbell has also been with QPR since 2011 and was signed for €2mill.

All three of these players are in their 30's and will not likely have a lot of chances to make their mark in the first-team.  I am thinking that Redknapp may try to replace Cisse with one of these attackers.  Personally I do not think any of them will fit the bill.  DJ Campbell is the only one who I think might have a chance, but I guess we will have a better idea tomorrow.

In reality, I think QPR will still need to buy a striker.

That just seems like arguing semantics. In the end, it was effectively the state, at the behest of the government, who took Railtrack Infrastructure Ltd (or whatever the formal name was) back in to public ownership. I seem to remember reading that this only happened once they tried to find a buyer for the company, unsurprisingly no one wanted it was it was a total basketcase. 

It isn't a privately owned, publicly traded company any more and that didn't happen by itself.

Don't forget Stephen Byers (a Labour politician in the Labour government of the time) engineering the acceleration of Railtrack's demise.

&gt; That said, I'd have preferred Labour to just renationalise public transport.. however I don't think they'd have found it very easy or cheap to do since they'd run into a lot of legal issues, for example if Network Rail was publicly owned then they would have had to buy Railtrack at a much higher price due to the Human Rights Act.

They did, and have taken over franchises in the past, albeit for a temporary period. Southeastern was in state ownership for a while, and East Coast currently is (via ""Directly Operated Railways Ltd""). If the West Coast situation didn't drag on it may well have gone to the state too.

It means you probably also take pride in what you do. Too many people in this country dont take pride in the jobs they do. Your wallet will probably be rewarded in future!

But a question, when I'm bagging up my shopping sometimes it says 'unexpected item in baggage area'... This is after ive paid for it aswell. 

But after that TIL theres scales under the 'bagging area', its probably because i left the shopping up in one hand, put the items in the bag with the other and then put the whole bag back in the baggage area, fucking up the scales.

Tell your managers you'd like to meet with the engineering company and tell them to write in software so it remembers how much the paid for shopping weighs.. So if an item/items are picked up and put back (obviously bagged) it doesnt start going UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGAGE AREA.

The machine should only reset when all the items are lifted off the scales... Or if it doesnt add up. i.e. bottle of whiskey put in baggage area, lifted up and a big bar of chocolate is put in its place... Then you get the unexpected item bullshit.

Other security measures may need to be added though, like a 'unscanned item in scanning area', if theres an item there that u havent paid for... And a new message on the terminal saying 'to use these terminals, you must pay for every item you've brought here in one go'.

Then the 'terminal admins' (what are they called btw) only have to look at the floor and peoples baskets when they're paying, making sure nothing else is in them.

true,callumgg,,Belfast/London,"&gt;When I joined the UUP in late 2004 some were surprised by my decision. I had no particular ties to the party, no political connections at all in fact and the UUP were a party under pressure. A position confirmed the following year when the party lost all but one of its Westminster seats in the general election.
&gt; 
&gt;But it was precisely because the UUP was under such pressure that I joined.  I had voted YES for the Agreement in 1998. I believed in it then, and I believe in it now. 
&gt; 
&gt;Perhaps, there could have been better communication of the detail, perhaps there should have been a greater effort to sell the Agreement, but even with the benefit of hindsight, nobody has yet presented a better alternative.
&gt; 
&gt;There is a simple truth to Northern Ireland. We live in a divided society. There is no future for Northern Ireland that is not based on a shared future. There is no future for Northern Ireland that that will not require some accommodation with those with a different perspective and there is no future for Northern Ireland that will not involve ongoing political dialogue.
&gt; 
&gt;Some may have hoped that with the Belfast Agreement we could “draw a line in the sand” but we squandered that opportunity. The UUP paid a heavy price for failing to convince the electorate of the benefits of the Agreement, so too has Northern Ireland. The disaster of 2005 was seven years in the making.  Internal divisions, disinterested partners and political opponents keen to manipulate the fears of the electorate for their own political advantage conspired to put the Belfast Agreement at risk.
&gt; 
&gt;Those same forces remain active today, colluding with each other to ratchet up tensions and create fears in the electorate for short term, selfish, political advantage with reckless disregard for our future. The hugely damaging controversy surrounding the flying of the Union flag at Belfast City Hall was not an accident but a carefully orchestrated political manoeuvre designed with clear electoral objectives in mind.
&gt; 
&gt;Such tactics have used been used repeatedly over the years for base political advantage. Those that won the 2007 Assembly elections did so by ruthlessly exploiting the electorate’s fears, they promised a new deal, a better deal, “A Fair Deal” only to deliver more or less the same deal.
&gt; 
&gt;The party that once jeered at the Belfast Agreement now uses the language of a shared future from its conference platform attempting to reach out to non-traditional voters. Yet in other forums it argues for greater unionist cooperation to maximise unionist seats. Such cynical electoral manoeuvring should not be lost on the electorate.
&gt; 
&gt;Nor is the UUP the party it once was. Losing election after election the party has lost confidence in its ability to win an argument, any argument.  It is tempted to retreat to the core and to seek safety in electoral pacts, joined candidates and greater unionist cooperation, oblivious to the fact that this will lead to its destruction as an independent political party.
&gt; 
&gt;The Ulster Unionist Party must not go down this route. It would be a betrayal of the Belfast Agreement and the people who stood with the party during the difficult years. The party should stand on its record, build on its vision of a shared future as described in the Belfast Agreement and make the case for a Union that is stronger when it is a Union for everyone. The constitutional position has been secured by the Belfast Agreement and the economic case has never been stronger, but respect for the cultural identity of all our citizens is essential if we persuade them of our good intent.   
&gt; 
&gt;Unlike some in the party, I was not born an Ulster Unionist, I chose to become one. I have stayed with the party through thick and thin, and I will continue do so for as long as I am convinced that the party is committed to the vision and values set out in the Belfast Agreement. The Agreement was endorsed by the party and the people of Northern Ireland and is, as far as I am aware, still party policy.
&gt; 
&gt;Whilst the Belfast Agreement provides a solid foundation it has significant limitations. There is widespread disenchantment with a political process that is unable or unwilling to tackle any serious issue.  Mandatory coalition within the executive has reduced the Assembly to little more than a talking shop. Political reform is required.

&gt;The public mood is for reform but any reform will require the presence of viable independent alternatives and a fundamental change in voting patterns. Those that want a shared future must realise that they too can cooperate to maximise the number of “shared future” seats and when adopting policy stances on the flying of flags or the naming of parks they are mindful of the views of the whole community.

For example, I enjoyed ""The Pandorica Opens""/""The Big Bang"" as a conclusion to Season 5: Misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's able to prep a loophole and come back. I thought the method and motive of assassination was clever and well established by the meta-arc of the season; I thought the rules of the pocket universe were clear and interesting; I thought the loophole was played fairly and was also joyfully clever in its execution.

But then we fast forward a season and we find ""The Wedding of River Song"": A misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's able to prep a loophole and come back.

Only this time there is no motive presented for the assassination attempt; the method makes no sense; the pocket universe is a lot of sound and fury without clear or coherent rules to its existence; and the loophole is puerile.

We saw this same ""deja vu decay"" in RTD's run: A dalek accusing the Doctor of being a good dalek in ""Dalek"" was astonishingly brilliant storytelling that evoked what had happened to the Doctor and how it had changed him.

I'm not saying that this is what Britain is doing. I just want to point out that a country pulling in such a direction and thereby immobilising the entire project can be a reason for others to want it to leave. You have to have some pragmatism and see what works, else there is not point wasting all that taxmoney on discussions. And to be fair, I think the EU could definitely do without Britain. So it's just a matter for the other countries to wage things against eachother. At the moment this is not a point of discussion but it could become one in the future. 

But what strikes me is that you say 'They'. This is what many british seem to do. So you are already placing yourself outside something you could be playing an active role in. 

I spoke to many Germans working in Law and Finance who would be happy to have given up Frankfurt as a financial center in favor of making London the absolute center of the Euro, if only Britain wasn't so anti-euro and EU-sceptical. That is the big difference in EU-attitude between Germans and British. The Germans have a positive attitude projecting their values onto the EU, and as a consequence they have a lot of influence as to what is the EU about. Ok at present it's probaby safer to not be part of the Euro zone, but many in the Eurozone see that as temporary. In the long run it might have been more beneficial for Britain to have joined. London being an even more important and more influential financial centrum being one of those reasons... 

The EU indeed wants compliance to Human Rights and has been very important in bringing peace and convicting war criminals. So yeah to the basic humanistic values and the rule of law the British value so much, the EU rightly wants compliance. And in my opinion it would be better for such a humane and civilized country like Britain to be an influential memberstate actively building the EU with a postive approach.

Some murders are considered morally worse than others (killing children is considered worse than killing adults or old people etc..), even though legally they might be in the same category and receive the same punishment. In fact, I think I would be hard pressed to find two cases of murder from which you could not choose which was morally worse, even if only by a little bit.

Besides, just like with murder, which is not exactly defined in its border cases (is abortion or euthanasia murder or not? and which month of fetal development makes it murder? Is ""standing your ground"" murder or justified defense? people disagree), the same applies to sex with minors - age of consent is pretty varied around the world. I often see USA-centric redditors outraged over sexualising teens and comparing it to pedophilia, yet 15 year old is the AoC where I live and I see no one here outraged over it.

**Man starts affair with Tesco automatic self service checkout**

Dave Headworth, a 27 year old account manager from Nantwich has fallen hopelessly in love with the voice of the self service checkout at his local Tesco superstore.

‘I’d been working late and had just popped into the store to get something for my supper and used the self service checkout to dodge the queues. I wasn’t taking much notice until a sultry voice said ‘Do you have a clubcard?’ and my pulse starting racing immediately. I knew straightaway she was the one for me.’

After their first encounter, Dave went back to the Tesco’s every evening. ‘At first, I thought all the self service checkouts had the same voice, but after a while I realised that No.3’s voice was sexier and had more personality. Since then I’ve always been faithful to No. 3. ’

Dave admits that conversation is limited but puts that down to No.3’s shyness. ‘She does have a great sense of humour,’ he said. ‘Sometimes I tease her and remove my shopping too early. Quick as a flash she retorts by saying something hilarious like ‘Item has been removed from the bagging area’. Well, actually, that’s what she always says. But it’s still very funny.’

Dave’s problem is how to take the romance to the next stage. ‘No. 3 has been non-committal when it comes to developing our relationship and she has not agreed to come out with me yet.’ However he remains optimistic. ‘I think it is only a matter of time, I bought a packet of condoms yesterday evening and she didn’t raise any objections. She’s a wonderful lady and I do so want to put an unexpected item in her bagging area.’

Dismissing the store manager’s loudly voiced opinion that he was a ‘sad tosser’ as ‘jealously’, Dave said that he wasn’t a pathetic loser and had affairs with girls before. ‘I was once engaged to the office’s voicemail system,’ he recalled, ‘but she cut us off.’

true,PhatWingChun,null,null,"OK cool. What subject will you be studying? NCN is one of the main colleges and has several campuses around Notts so the subject you take will decide on which campus you'll be at. Again the same can be said for NTU as they have City or Clifton campus. Clifton I believe may be quite cheap and if you're at the Clifton. Campus then could save you time and money traveling.

I'm fairly certain that's what happened. The end of ""The Wedding of River Song"" establishes that Kevarian isn't actually dead (because she was killed in an alternate timeline) and nothing else in that episode did anything to get rid of the Silence. So they're still out there.

This can be somewhat difficult to notice, though, because, AFAICT, Moffat forgot the end of last season as soon as he wrote it. I thought establishing the idea of the Doctor as being ""undercover"" was a great way to move away from the weekly barrage of ""THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS IN PERIL! FOR REALZ THIS TIME!"". But the first thing they did in Season 7 was immediately undercut that, then redo it on a micro-scale with just the Daleks, and then go back to telling the exact same stories with absolutely no indication that the Doctor is, in any way, keeping a low profile.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I agree with this, its one of the things that i actually love about Levy. As much as it is frustrating at times, its a business and he is clearly a guy who understands fundamentals of good business.

Its not that Levy doesn't care about Spurs on an emotional level, i think he has a very vested interest both emotionally and economically in how we do.  But in the end, like it or not, its a business and he treats it as such.  Its good business to have a team that wins and competes on the highest stages, but its not good business to pay massive cost or wages to do so.  He gets this, yes as a fan it hurts when we lose a Berba or Modric but the end game is always going to be maintaining or improving the team because a team that succeeds is a profitable team. If that means selling on a star and replacing them he is willing to do that without getting emotional about the decision.

If anyone wants to feel better about having Levy as a chairman, go watch the documentary ""The Four Year Plan"" about QPR when they got bought out in the Championship (its streaming on Netflix). Watching Falvio Briatore rant and get emotional about QPR makes you thank whatever diety you want that Levy is our chairman.

In any organisation and group you need people to be thinking the opposite otherwise you  may as well all march of the cliff to your doom. As i have said in other posts the Eu  haemorrages money like a kid in a candy store. 200million a year to transfer to strasbourg every month. The accounts havent been signed off for 16 years. To me anybody either business or personal who hasn't had their accounts sorted for 16 years should not be able to make financial decisions. The human rights legislation in principle is good. However it is abused beyond the pale. It has lost its legitimacy and founding principles. Too many ""leaders"" are in it for the money etc and not for their respective constituancy.  The other issue is that because of alot of EU legislation it has prevented UK and stifled UK from trading worldwide by trying to force an internal market either by accident or by design.

I somewhat agree with you. The show has it's ups and downs. 

&gt; First, because it doesn't make any sense given the context presented in the story (it would be like people saying ""doesn't Bush look tired?"" during his ""Mission Accomplished"" press conference) unless we're willing to grant the Doctor vast and far-reaching telepathic brainwashing powers.

I think it's established that the Doctor has some far-reaching ability to perceive how time can be affected at certain points. It seems like he knew that if he said the right phrase to the right person, it could catch like wildfire.

&gt; Second, because the actual Thatcher slander campaign was heavily based in the misogynist meme that a woman couldn't be strong enough to lead. The word ""tired"" was a code phrase that allowed people to trot out their misogyny without actually saying it straight out. Having the Doctor mimic that is like having the Doctor question the qualification of a black American president by saying, ""Isn't he a little lazy on welfare?""

I thought Thatcher was ousted because of 'resistance to European economic and political union' and because of her 'combative personality and leadership tactics.' I'm not British so I have little concern over their political history.

Key quotes from Watson's furious refutation

&gt; My main argument against this article is that this approach ignores the evidence of the experiences of abused children, the experiences of adult survivors of child abuse and the experiences of many professionals who work to protect children. **It is a risky strategy at the current time because so many of those who promoted the rights of the ‘paedophile’ have in later years been convicted of sexual crimes against children. Equally, so many of those whom this lobby attacked have been vindicated in their efforts to protect and gain justice for children and survivors.**
&gt;
&gt; For Jon, the current public discourse is hindered because of moral panic around child abuse. Saying “If the complexity and divergence of professional opinion may have helped create today’s panic around paedophilia, a media obsession with the subject has done more: a sustained hue and cry exemplified by the News of the World’s notorious “name and shame” campaign in 2000, which brought mobs to the streets, to demonstrate against the presence of shadowy monsters in their midst.”
&gt;
&gt; Defining moral panic this way with respect to the sexual abuse of children is shows a failure to understand the term. Stanley Cohen, author of “Folk Devils and Moral Panics” defines moral panic as “when a condition, episode, person or group emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests. Those who start the panic fear a threat to prevailing societal values”. Opposing the sexual abuse of children and upholding their human rights doesn’t fit this definition. Prevailing societal values are not under threat by those who challenge child sexual abuse because this society clearly legislates and upholds the rights of children to be protected from harm and all forms of abuse. **The concept of a ‘moral panic’ is an academic argument being exploited to attack those who are striving to protect children from harm.** They would never say that those who oppose racism are part of a moral panic so why apply it to those who oppose childism (to borrow an “ism” from the experts)?

and

&gt;&gt; A liberal professor of psychology who studied in the late 1970s will see things very differently from someone working in child protection or with convicted sex offenders.
&gt;
&gt; If there is such a person, daring to call themselves ‘liberal’ then I would want to know why they have not developed their thinking since the 70s to understand the dynamics of child sexual abuse and of child sexual abusers in a context of prevalence studies, survivor accounts and research, academic research and the findings and recommendations from hundreds of Inquiries. **I cannot imagine why a Professor would want to situate themselves as seeing things differently from someone working in child protection. This would imply that they are confidently situating themselves outside the law, policy and practice guidance relating to the safety of children from sexual crime and abuse.**

and

&gt; **I hope Jon Henley reflects on how his features piece has, inadvertently I’m sure, lent credibility to bogus claims about child abuse that make it harder for policy makers to act decisively**. In the few short weeks I’ve been looking at this subject, I know that we are failing children today. We have to act with boldness and at scale. I’m talking to colleagues about what Labour’s future policy in child protection might look like. I hope to talk to colleagues from other parties also. 

You can almost imagine someone telling him to put in the "",inadvertently I'm sure,"" bit in to soften the implication. But he left in ""It is a risky strategy..."", which is even more damning.

&gt; Survivors of child sex abuse commonly suffer from depression, anxiety disorders, panic attacks, phobias, flashbacks, disturbing thoughts, intrusive memories, self-harming, alcoholism, eating disorders, and feelings of shame, anger and worthlessness. This is the reality, but Jon Henley doesn’t voice it in his piece

Meanwhile The Sun has weighed in 

http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4725675/The-Guardian-criticised-over-paedophile-article-by-Jon-Henley.html

&gt; THE Guardian newspaper was under fire yesterday over an article defending child molesters.
&gt;
&gt; The left-wing title provoked anger by quoting a convicted paedophile’s view that sex between a man and a child can be consensual — and not cause harm.
&gt;
&gt; And it repeated controversial research that as many as one in five men is “capable of being sexually aroused by children"".
&gt;
&gt; The article, by feature writer Jon Henley, also stated that pervert Jimmy Savile was technically NOT a paedophile but an ephebophile — someone attracted to adolescents.
&gt;
&gt; Cops believe he may have abused up to 300 victims. Stunned readers blasted the story online. 
&gt;
&gt; Henry Evans accused the paper of publishing “essentially pro-paedophile propaganda”.
&gt;
&gt; Murun Buchstansangur wrote: “Guardian must be the only paper dementedly liberal enough to give a platform to a convicted paedophile.”

I like the way they don't put 'Murun Buchstansangur' in quotes to show they know it is a pseudonym referencing [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murun_Buchstansangur). But perhaps such niceties are wasted on their readers. Still at least they grasp that paedophilia == evil. 

&gt;
&gt; The story quotes Tom O’Carroll, former chairman of the Paedophile Information Exchange with a conviction for distributing indecent photographs.

And this is a very good point.

&gt; He said: “If there’s no bullying, no coercion, no abuse of power, if the child enters into the relationship voluntarily... the evidence shows there need be no harm.”

Got to love The Sun really. Its readers are sufficiently simple that they can *smell* bullshit from someone like Jon Henley.

As Orwell observed

http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat

&gt; It is, I think, true to say that the intelligentsia have been more wrong about the progress of the war than the common people, and that they were more swayed by partisan feelings. The average intellectual of the Left believed, for instance, that the war was lost in 1940, that the Germans were bound to overrun Egypt in 1942, that the Japanese would never be driven out of the lands they had conquered, and that the Anglo-American bombing offensive was making no impression on Germany. He could believe these things because his hatred for the British ruling class forbade him to admit that British plans could succeed. There is no limit to the follies that can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English revolution. **One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.**

It's safe to assume that Orwell would not have been keen on the idea that an intellectual elite should run the country.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is gonna be a long question: I saw an article a few months ago about how you could pay what ever you want for an item because the price was encoded in the barcode. I think its been removed since but it went something like this:

When an item is reduced a special barcode is added to it, the barcode is in this format:

 * [Reduced reason code] [Normal barcode] [Price] [check digit]

So if a item had the barcode 1832848234823 you would take off the last digit since it was the check one, add a 3 digit code which specifies the reason why the item was reduced (damaged, about to expire, etc) to the front of the barcode, add the new price you want to pay (£1.05 = 00105, 21p = 00021, etc) to the end, then the check digit.

Example: 

* The original barcode is 1832848234823
* You want to pay £0.15
* The reduced code is 971
* The new barcode would be 97118328482348236000157

I've not tested out what the article said, but in supermarkets I have noticed that barcodes do follow this pattern and the price seems to be encoded in the barcode.

So on the self service you could select ""enter in a barcode"" and in theory get an item that costs £10 for 1p.

*(TLDR)* Is it true you can use the reduced barcodes to pay what ever you want for an item?

In the next game against Mansfield the manager will probably rotate (players) a bit; you will surely want to start then, right?

&gt; Yes. It’s good that the manager wants to rotate. A player always wants to be in the starting 11, no matter the game. I have a lot of expectations of playing and helping the club.


Since the last time you started was, if I’m not mistaken, in November in Moscow; what would it mean to you if you started this game?

&gt; It would be very important for me, since one works hard day in day out to be available for the manager and be able to play and demonstrate that one is available to the manager. That would be very important to me.

Also considering that there’s a very efficient tandem between Agger and Skrtel, how hard is the competition to play in this club?

&gt; Yes, it’s difficult. I believe Martin and Daniel are a great level; and, as a partner (fellow CB) one has to support and learn from both of them. It’s so good that they’re in a great level and try to learn all the good things they do, and support them at all times so that the club goes forward. I believe the most important thing here is the club, and the more players are at a good level more important the club will be.

You mentioned that you admire them both and Carra, do you think you have learned something from them as a player, playing next to them?

&gt; Yes, I think I've learned a lot from the 3. I think it is a matter of adaptation, thanks to them during training or in the field, they give you orders and I think day by day one can learn a lot from them three, in my case for my position. But I think you learn a lot from all players.

What do you think you have to do to get your spot on the regular team?

&gt; I have to keep working hard. At this time it is difficult because the two that are playing in my position are doing very well, I cannot complain much. I think that is to train hard, be patient and wait for the opportunity.

What would it mean to appear more often and have more continuity in the team?

&gt; For me it would be very important because it is a great institution and a great club. To be in the starting 11 every weekend would be very nice. Every player wants to succeed in the club and be part of the club.

Before signing with the club did you know what the FA Cup was?

&gt; Yes, in South America they pass many matches from the English league and cups. Now there are holidays in South America and people watch a lot of football. It is one of the few leagues that does not stop, and in my house was always on the television.

You also played against Oldham at the same stage last year; did you have a good time?

&gt; Yes, it was one of my first shares in the club. I did enjoy it. Try to enjoy it a lot and luckily we were able to pass that round which is the goal and try to reach the final.

Reaching the final last year, while you weren’t in the team was it a blow to lose in a game pretty much even?

&gt; Yes I think it is always hard to lose. But in the end we had made a great cup and we deserved to stay with the cup. But that happens in football and we should learn from this defeat and try to get back to the finals and try to win.

Speaking of the next opponent, they play on the fifth level, which challenges await with Manfield?

&gt; I think it will be a difficult game and I think they will be very excited to play against a big club and they will try to give the maximum. So we have to be vigilant and try to get a great result.

You referred to the fact that it is a very big occasion for them, as big as a cup final for them, so we have to respect them?

&gt; Yes, I think for them it will be very important to face Liverpool and then they will try to win and bring happiness to the people. So we must not underestimate the opponent and go with the mindset that they will try their best to win.

Many times these pitches have problems; the state can influence the game. Do you have to play differently?

&gt; Maybe so. But I think we need not worry so much on the game field. We worry about trying to play to win. I think we should not make excuses for the field, we should worry about us.

Surely they will not have much pressure; they’ve also won their last game 3-0. This is good for them, right?

&gt; Maybe. I think for them it’s good that we go to their field and they will try to beat us. We have to go knowing they will do all they can to win, play our style of game and try to play so they do not have the opportunity.

What does it mean reaching the final for two years in a row?

&gt; I think that is the goal we all have. Trying to play the final again, because we arrived with the spine of last year. I think the goal we all have is to go to Wembley. Most importantly, we have to go game after game and try to go to ensure matches to have that nice opportunity to step on Wembley again

With the streak that Luis has, thankfully he has a red shirt and no other color.

&gt; Yes I am quite familiar with Luis; he played in the same club as me. He showed that as a boy he had some great qualities and I think that it is showing now. I think he’s been sensational game after game; he’s scored goals but also helps the team. Luckily we have him on our team and not as a rival.

In your opinion your friend Luis is the best striker in Europe today?

&gt; Yes, I think now he’s one of the best. There are many who are very good, but at the moment, it is happening Luis. It has to do, more than anything, with what I said before, apart from scoring goals, he helps the team a lot. He always pressures the opponent and gets the ball quickly. I think that helps the team a lot and the features he has, never giving up, I think that makes a great player.

Can he (Luis) be an even better player?

&gt; As I said yes. He never gives up. What he does in games he does in training so he can stay in the moment that he is now. And hopefully he will.

And the famous Kop, they love Luis and he loves being here.

&gt; Yes I think all Liverpool fans like Luis. Luis is very happy to be here. The city and people treat him very well and his family loves it here, I think that is also very important.

Multi billion pound companies will make sure that they're systems are water tight, and they wouldn't let something as simple as changing a few numbers in their bar codes affect the price.

Think of it like this, if a item comes into the store at £1.50 and it matches up with the bar-code? What a coincidence! What if over time the store reduces the price to £1? They don't alter the bar code because well... they can't. They just change it on the system!

However, what stores do do is when they reduce their items to clear (e.g. the day they go off.) they remove them from the system and give them a stick on bar-code that goes over the top of the original with a great reduction price on it. What we see often is people peeling these stickers off reduced products, and attempting to scan a £30 joint of meat through as a 30p reduced pot of Olives.

I see the non DM partner in the pivot as the most important player in a 4-2-3-1. They should be the ones dictating pace and ensuring the link to the front 4 is consistent and challenging for the opposition.

Against QPR we were really struggling to get the ball to the creative players for large chunks of the game. Luiz is playing out of position and i think he's a one direction player so expecting him to link up the front is a bit silly. It's that type of situation where lampard needs to be getting posession and finding forwards.

It's something that lampard doesn't need to do so much when mikel is there because mikel is a pretty good link player even if he has a small passing circle.

I'll give it a shot, although obviously this is going to be very cherry-picked, subjective and controversial. So I wouldn't take it too seriously. 

On the neoliberal front I think that many the views in this thread are now supportive of £9000 tuition fees in England.

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/15vxh5/bbc_news_uk_university_applications_down_for/

I also recall at the time being amazed at how many people were willing to defend Andrew Lansley and the NHS proposals. 

Whenever secondary education is discussed grammar schools are always, without exception, mentioned. School vouchers are occasionally mooted as well, an opinion I have never come across someone holding before. 

I also think that UKIP gets a lot more mentions than it should. Every other day there is some thread related to UKIP or Nigel Farage. Leaving the EU is mentioned very regularly as well. 

&gt;Also there's absolutely no way you can say with a straight face that Thatcherism is 'popular' on r/ukpolitics, when a recent poll found the sub was 80/20 in ratio of left/right wing support.

Could you give a link for that? I know Thatcher herself is a Marmite issue on /r/unitedkingdom (which she is not in Scotland), but the central ideas still seem popular.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I don't think anyone is doing that though. Even on the most controversial point of consensual paedophilic relations The Guardian was only saying that academics disagree on the level of harm it does to the child.

**Tagline: but experts disagree about [...] even how much harm it causes**

First paragraph: ""Childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in with an adult,"" it read, ""result in no identifiable damage …

Third paragraph: There is, astonishingly, not even a full academic consensus on whether consensual paedophilic relations necessarily cause harm.

Fourteenth paragraph: we outlawed homosexuality, and we were wrong. Perhaps we're wrong about paedophilia.""

Fifteenth paragraph: Social perceptions do change. Child brides were once the norm; in the late 16th century the age of consent in England was 10. [This is the most damning point, because it is the *stupidest* and the *most nonsensical* within the context of this article.]

Sixteenth paragraph: ""If there's no bullying, no coercion, no abuse of power, if the child enters into the relationship voluntarily … the evidence shows there need be no harm.""

Eighteenth paragraph: that such relationships, entered into voluntarily, are ""nearly uncorrelated with undesirable outcomes"".

Nineteenth paragraph: ""persuasive evidence for the harmfulness of paedophilic relationships does not yet exist"".

Clearly the bulk of the article is about how ""paedophilic relations"" (child abuse) aren't really ""harmful"", drawing from a cabal of ""experts"" who write paedo apologia and happen to have PhDs. No space given to the voices of the abused. About two paragraphs talking about how these aren't actually mainstream, widely-held, or even creditable positions. Nothing about the *bulk* of studies on paraphilias and sexual abuse of children, which clearly demarcate these ""experts"" as fringe voices.

You could taper the penalties for having sex with someone under 16 depending on the age difference. There is evidence that by 25 people are literally old enough to know better. Hell you could make it 20. At that point having sex with someone under 16 is prosecuted as rape. You could interpolate the penalties from nothing to a rape between the two ages. Also you could imagine having penalties that were even more serious for adults that had sex with anyone under 12. I'd lock these people up indefinitely on the grounds that are insane and dangerous. Once again you can interpolate, though it seems like there's room for debate about what the function should be - essentially you're discussing a function that generates a prison sentence based on the ages of the people involved. Or you can imagine a surface with the X and Y dimensions being the ages of the people involved and the Z one being the severity of the sentence. 

But this is the sort of thing that democracies are good at - there'd be debate in the media and pressure on MPs to tweak the function to produce the sort of results that most people agree with. Tweaks to the law are building hills (tougher penalties) and digging valleys (less tough penalties) in that surface.

[Here's the poll](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=50e0916fe4b0c066f1c5557c). It's a bit less than I remember - including Labour/Lib Dem/Green/SNP/Plaid Cymru is about 70%. There's about 10% of 'other' as well. Conservatives, UKIP and BNP below 20%.

I saw that tuition fee thread. I didn't read it as many being in support of it (though there were a few I agree) but there were lots of people exasperated about misconceptions about how it is paid back (i.e. only when you're earning 21k)

I think also UKIP's getting a lot of mentions because it's quite rapidly become a party of note, threatening to tear the conservatives apart. Farage has achieved a prominence he never had before - whether it's temporary or not remains to be seen.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"When the falklands comes up in this subreddit people are happy to assert British sovereignty based on self determination, if you believe in that principle don't call it 'jingoism' when it appears in an Argentine newspaper, that's hypocritical. I am disappointed in all of you.

This letter was written as a response to Kircher's propaganda and falsehoods. It is specifically a reply to a letter written by her which appeared in a national newspaper. When the Argentines are being lied to by their own media and government, being told that the islanders WANT to be liberated, being told that it was formally an Argentine colony when it never was and so forth why the bloody hell should we not communicate basic truths to them. We have a right of reply when we are being defamed and attempts are being made to steal our land. The Argentines aren't going to start any new wars over the Falklands, we have battleships parked nearby that can take out their entire air force. They attempted it in the 80s because the then government mistakenly believed we would not defend the Islands, now they know we will and they are not going to enter in to a suicide mission to get a few rocky outposts in the Atlantic. 

This letter in the Sun may be a tad provocative, but that's A GOOD THING. Getting the Argentines to consider what a military invasion of the islands would actually entail and what a hopeless cause it would be for the country should prompt them, if they have any sense, to recognise Kirchner's hot air for what it is, she's relying on false promises of getting the islands in return for a blind eye being turned to her failing economic policies. The Falklanders should be able to live their lives without constant threats being made to their community and their land and without obstruction of their livelihoods. They should be able to trade freely with Brazil or Chile without interference from Argentina. As compatriots of the Falklanders the Sun has every right and indeed a duty to tell the Argentine government to fuck the fuck off.

He was a young punk trying to act mature and serious. Now that he is actually old, he's an old geezer trying to act young and silly. 

The fourth Doctor spoke of himself as approaching middle-age in his 700s, which puts the first Doctor (at the age of 400) around the human equivalent of the early 20s when he regenerated. His first regeneration was basically on his 21st birthday.      

This also puts the current 11th Doctor around the human equivalent of 60.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In the finest tradition of bad internet advice, here are some thoughts that will inevitably apply more to me than you. Pick whatever resonates and run with that.

&gt; Got a 2.2 last year. Not really bothered with my subject now. I just... really don't care.

It hurts when I admit I've failed at something I care about. It hurts less if I tell myself I didn't really care about it in the first place. I can take this to an extreme and self-sabotage-- not trying in the first place to give my ego an out if I fail.

Pretending to me someone who doesn't care is mentally sticky-- I spend my time one step outside myself, ironically detached, acting out the role of someone who doesn't care. And as I screw my life up by living the facade, I become dependent on it. I need to be that someone who doesn't care, so I can cope with the mess created by pretending to be careless. Both my mental habits and psychological need make me someone who is fundamentally _not me_; and this person gets to call the shots.

If this applies to you, keep an eye on your thoughts for anything that would undermine your ability to achieve in something that you used to care about.

&gt; was awesome that these jobs don't require you to sweat your brains out.

Intuition or any self-help book will tell you that happiness, in a large part, is watching yourself gain mastery in pursuit of whatever you have allowed yourself to be completely emotionally invested in. It helps if it's 'craft-like'-- something you do with your hands guided by accumulated experience.

I love tedious manual labour because it half-approximates what my degree lacks. I get to remake part of the world according to my will, plus I get a concrete sense of achievement. I go crazy if I don't fill my life with ways to distract myself from my degree. That doesn't mean I don't value my degree--I do--but I need more than that in my life. I would go crazy washing dishes if that was all I had.

&gt; My whole life it's been study study study and spit out info during exam time.

Depression sucks. The scariest thing about depression is how it introduced systematic bias into my memory. Depression is self-perpetuating because the depressed person's memories confirm  their depressed view of the world as the real world. No matter how 'rational' I tried to be, my empirical data was wrong. I tried to compensate for the bias. It didn't work. My own formal thought processes has almost nothing to do with how I'm really making decisions; at a barely or sub-conscious level.

When I'm depressed I not only cannot be trusted to make good decisions for my future self, I don't want to. I hate my future self and take pleasure in screwing him over (the smug bastard that he is).

If you are depressed, tell as many people as you can. You will not be being selfish or being 'that needy guy'. Don't procrastinate on getting help. Don't substitute lifestyle fixes for getting help.

&gt; I just think I wouldn't mind having an average job. I don't need lots of money to be happy.

No matter how much you study for your degree, you have a couple of years to acquire as many superpowers as you can pack in. This is time to make yourself a more awesomer version of you. You have infinite books, awesome people who are easyish to approach, and a flexible formal workload.

Or look at the people arrested in Operation Yewtree - they got away with it for years. Savile got away with it completely because he died before the crimes he committed became public. 

The problem is that the people who run the country are so muddle headed with half digested and misunderstood memes from sociology that they don't act decisively.

More my preferred line-up than my expected one. 

Also, as always when you field a weakened team, a strong bench: Gulacsi, Skrtel, Suarez, Sturridge, Ibe, Hendo, Adorjan.

I expect there to be a few younger players in the starting 11 and a couple more on the bench. Adorjan's been one of our stand-out players in the youth team and deserves to travel, and I'd like to see Ibe there too, I'm a big fan. Obviously we don't want a situation where we *need* to bring big names off the bench, best case scenario is that we take a good lead in the first hour and can bring on Suarez and Sturridge together for the final 15 or so, let them have a run-out together. Whatever happens, I expect set-pieces to be important - whether or not Coates goes out on loan, he'll probably play tomorrow and on a shit pitch, his height (as well as that of Wisdom, Coady) will be important to put to good use.

You'd need to probably put in employee limits. For example, you can only apply for 2.5% corporate tax if you have more than 10 employees. This will encourage small companies to hire more people and it will stop (read:limit) individuals from starting their own bullshit company so they can avoid income tax. 

Our government debt is currently at £1,300bn so really an extra 185bn wouldn't be that big a deal. If we can increase our GDP by just 2-3% a year then it would more than cancel that out.

true,HiHaterslol,lfc68,,"Bare with me with the spelling mistakes I may make because I'm on phone. Also, I exclusively play online is seasons mode. Not sure why lol.

I use the...I forget exactly what it's called, but it's a 4-1-3-2. I've only been using it recently (switched from a 4-3-3) because I wanted to get Boroni and Suarez together without sacrificing my midfield 3.

So the back 4 is (obviously) Glen, Skagger, and Enrique.

Protecting the back 4 is little Joe Allen. His overall stats aren't great, but he's great at winning the ball back, has decent ball control stats and really good short passing stats.

Then the next line is Assaidi ""wide"" left, Gerrard in the middle, and Sahin ""wide"" right. Wide is in quotes because the way the formation is set up, they're never really too wide.

Then Borini as left forward and Suarez on the right, just because Suarez doesn't have took many problems cutting in on his left foot while Boroni kinda does.

The thing is, Joe Allen can NOT be allowed to attack and has to be the one sitting back in case you get caught by a counter attack. He usually picks up all the hasty clearances your opponent makes and has good passing options because everyone is in front of him.

If I'm getting killed in midfield (like when im playing Madrid with their God Mode pace) I'll switch to a 4-2-3-1 with Sahin and Allen as the back two with Suarez on the left, Gerrard in the middle, and Assaidi on the right. Borini up front because he's deceptively fast and has good finishing stats. 

When I'm feeling naughty, I'll bring on Sterling for wtf speed. Him and Assaidi can't finish, but boy are they fast. Sterling has been improved since the start of the season though. He went from a 60 overall to a 73 or something. Not bad.

And as much as I love Borini, I'll probably replace him with Sturridge. Better ball control and finishing, plus he's unfairly fast.

Now I'm not great at FIFA, but I have a pretty decent record in seasons (33-15-11?) and I'm on a weird streak where I've won like 10 in a row and everything is going right for me. I can't win a cup game to save my life, but that's another story.

He understood where Meireles was going to go based on his body language, speed and knowledge of where the space is.

I admire her desire to produce something different (some of my favorite writers jump effortlessly between genres), I just wasn't impressed with the result.

I knew exactly what I was expecting when I read Casual Vacancy, and it was not another Potter book. I'm not really that much of a fan of the fantasy genre, but I heard she was a good writer, so I read her books and enjoyed them immensely. What I was expecting when I bought Vacancy was a well-written story about ordinary people in uncomfortable circumstances, but instead I got a  badly-written book about badly-written ordinary people in badly-written uncomfortable circumstances.

I just found the characters two-dimensional, the plot mostly opaque, and the writing lacking in emotional or intellectual impact. It bored me so much I actually gave up two-thirds in, and that is not something I do lightly.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"First, it's hard to know how much statistics/sabermetrics are influencing our purchases, and whether they influence ours moreso than other clubs'. It was probably something that was hugely overdone in the media, as most things are; I also think that as the owners' time in charge of Liverpool has progressed and they've understood the sport a lot better, the influence of sabermetrics has reduced to an extent. I'm pretty sure it plays a part in what we do, but I'm skeptical as to whether we do it any more than plenty of other teams.

We certainly did it more when Damien Comolli was our Director of Football, with largely mixed results - Henderson, Downing &amp; Adam had all been in the top 10 for 'chances created' the season before we signed them, and I know that after we missed out on Ashley Young, Comolli looked at player stats as part of the decision to sign Downing; stats also played a significant role in signing Jose Enrique. 

The problem, though, was that Comolli also looked at the *wrong* stats, especially from a team-building approach; his theory was that teams that complete/attempt x amount of **crosses per game** are more likely to win. Thus, Liverpool ended up playing a crossing game, which very few top teams do anymore so who knows what Comolli was thinking, and not playing it well. That, and his bizarrely distorted understanding of what construes value for money (all the players he signed are good players, but many of them weren't worth the money he spent on them), means he got sacked.

So, right now, it seems like there's a few obvious 'guiding principles' for our transfers - British players seem to be favoured, and everyone we've signed since Comolli left has been 24 or younger (and of Comolli's signings, only 2 were above that age, Bellamy &amp; Downing). 

I'm not hugely thrilled about this - the argument that younger players have better resale value later makes sense for smaller clubs, but it's rubbish for a club like ours where if a young player succeeds, we'll want to keep him rather than sell him to anyone, and if he fails then we won't recoup our investment on him no matter his age. I also don't see why we're buying British anymore, because we have more than enough home-grown players, and once you've fulfilled that quota there's no reason to target overpriced British players whose foreign equivalents would cost less in transfer fees and wages. And all in all, having our transfer policy be so fucking *obvious* makes it harder for us to get bargains because other clubs know that we're less likely to have other options available to us who fit our criteria. 

Lastly, there's still some issues regarding the inexperience of our entire setup - new owners, new Managing Director, young manager, new scouting team, all to add to a young team still looking for the consistency to challenge for top 4.

Having said that, there's been plenty of good stuff, too - they've been cutting down the wage bill very effectively, which had grown in the years before their arrival despite the squad growing weaker (it's blasphemy that Rafa's 2008-09 title challenging team was on a lower wage bill than Hodgson's 2010-11 mess). The squad is also younger and better than it was when they came in, despite the frustrating missed chances and bungled signings under Comolli &amp; Dalglish. They've boosted our commercial revenue, which was another area we'd been selling ourselves short for years, and seem to have come up with a financially responsible solution for expanding Anfield. 

Next summer's transfer window will be the biggest judgment day for them, because Rodgers has to a degree proven that he's got what it takes to be a Liverpool manager and take the club forward, and the onus is on them to back him and help us put together a team that can legitimately challenge for top 4 next season.",0,1357351429,null,0,false,0,c7r8qkg,t3_15zdi3,t1_c7r8qkg,t3_15zdi3,null,1430859758,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Well it is not left wing.

&gt;Nationalised healthcare - that's a profoundly left-wing signature

Not exactly. I think you are confusing right wing with neoliberlism, which is a subset but not the entirety. People on the left and on the right can be in favor of national healthcare.

&gt;March 2, 1944- Churchill

&gt;""The discoveries of healing science must be the inheritance of all. That is clear. Disease must be attacked, whether it occurs in the poorest or the richest man or woman simply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the same way as the fire brigade will give its full assistance to the humblest cottage as readily as to the most important mansion… Our policy is to create a national health service in order to ensure that everybody in the country, irrespective of means, age, sex, or occupation, shall have equal opportunities to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.""

http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xR0zayMIpMoC&amp;pg=PA468&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false

The right wing does not see inequality as a problem and does not believe in government initiatives to handle inequality, however that doesn't necessarily mean they do not believe in a state and that they do not believe that the state itself should run certain services. Being right wing and arguing that defence, healthcare, policing and fire services should all be run by the state is a consistent argument. 

&gt;A 40% tax bracket that begins at only £35k (compared to America where you need to earn $300k+ to start paying that much).

You compare to America, I compare to Sweden.

&gt;Plenty of trade unions. 

And some of the most prohibitive laws against trade unions in the world. Again you compare workers right to the US, but I look to Europe (seeing we are a part of it and all).

&gt;We are pretty secular too in most ways. Not too many religious-influenced laws which again might typically be a right wing thing. We might be the first country to properly have equal marriage for homosexuals.

I disagree. There has been numerous points in the past year where the established CoE has interfered in laws. But as we are talking about perceptions on reddit, I conceded early on that social conservatism is unpopular (for instance drug legalisation gets an incredible level of support here).

&gt; but on the economy they are very different with Labour supposedly wanting to spend our way out and the Conservatives cutting spending to balance the books

The entire TARDIS is a LOT bigger than what we get to see in the show, multiple quotes say that.

On the topic of money... The Doctor isn't above abusing systems, he created an unlimited Credit Chip in one of the Episodes of Season 1 (the one with the news spacestation, I forgot the name). So I doubt he ever goes hungry.

Finally... We see only small tidbits of the Doctors life. He has adventures, both with companions and without them, that are never shown in the series, according to Amy in TATM they were back home for YEARS sometimes without any sign of the Doctor, until the Blue Box was there again.

In short, I doubt the Doctor spends much time, if any time, not adventuring.

Hong Kong was leased.... i.e. the unequal treaty you guys handed China in the 19th century was a bit less harsh than usual (no outright annexation). Besides that.. was it fair? No. Was it legal... well, in as far as it can be legal to wage war on a sovereign country for daring to enforce its own opium laws.

As for Rhodesia... what exactly is the legality around a bunch of anglo saxons who show up.. sieze some good land and then set up an apartheid regime?  Who are we kidding here? It's not a question of legality.. its a question of might makes right. 

What I meant to alude to is the question of natural interest. It cannot be denied that that keeping HK and Singapore might be more meaningful for UK national interest than the (also questionable) British sovereignty over some god-forsaken rocks on the south-side of the planet's ass. 

It seems to me, that the only reason the UK cared was because argentina cared. otherwise...the average brit on the street would probably not be able to find the falklands on a map. ",0,1357363280,null,0,false,0,c7rbzuj,t3_15wdo6,t1_c7rbzuj,t1_c7qu9xq,null,1430861298,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You can't have all youngsters playing for you. You need to have some veterans in the team for leadership and in Lampard's case skill. When he plays our midfiled is usually much more organized and the game flows more smoothly. It sucks how they're trying to get rid of him when they don't even have a solid replacement for him. KDB might eventually replace him but do you really think that he's ready for such a huge role? He can't play 90 minutes every game for the entire season, you need back-ups. Bring him back, use him or Lamps as a sub for the next season and have KDB learns as much as he can from the master himself.

That said, Harry Lloyd and Robert Sheehan are probably already out of the running because they're even younger than Matt. Henry Cavill will be way too busy after Man of Steel comes out. Cumberbatch already has Sherlock on his plate when he's not outrageously busy with his crazy busy schedule in Hollywood. Chiwetel Ejiofor will likely get snatched up by Disney/Marvel later this year when they announce the Black Panther movie. James Callis has stated in interviews that he doesn't want to play the Doctor (though that was back in his BSG days so it may have changed). Hugh Laurie, Idris Elba, and Sean Bean might just be a bit too high profile for the role.

After the cliffhanger of ""The Stolen Earth"", people were shitting themselves coming up with theories on how a/the moon would play into the resolution.

Next year, I'm going to say that for Series 7, people were *obsessed* with roses. 

I mean, *why Rose*? It's been three years since we last saw her. What possible story value is there in bringing her back? Her story is told. She had her send off. Is *Doctor Who*'s imagination so limited that we can't have new characters? Is *Doctor Who*'s scope so focused on the past that there can't be new mysteries?

Here is what I think you need to consider:
Clara's birthdate is November 23rd, which is Doctor Who's 50th anniversary (http://i.imgur.com/P11Du.jpg). I don't think this is mere coincidence, although it could be, but let's be real. They could have picked any day and they decided on November 23rd?

Also, the 50th anniversary will see the return of many characters, including David Tennant. Now, Billie Piper has recently denied any rumors of her being on the special. I personally think she is doing so because it has to be a surprise. Just like they did with not announcing that Jenna-Louise Coleman would be the new companion until after the Ponds left.

So maybe all of these pretty noticeable appearances of a rose/roses are mere coincidence. But, especially with the 50th anniversary coming up, I think it's highly unlikely.

As a reddit specific example I've found that comments on the wrong side of the reddit consensus (e.g. pro-Republican or Christian) tend to get a much better reaction when they're prefaced with something like ""I know this will get downvoted but..."" (in spite of the number of people who claim to automatically downvote such remarks). 

I think that this is because although redditors are clearly happy to downvote comments just because they disagree with them they become more reluctant if its framed as a matter of censorship.

I also think that reddit is far more sympathetic to views that at least claim to have science or reason behind them and less for more morality based arguments. For example i've never seen anyone on reddit express sympathy for homophobia because there's no rational justification for it, only moralistic ones. In Jon Henley's article he cites studies and includes quotes from academics and so appears to come at the issue from a rational perspective and he characterises the other side of the argument as being largely based in emotion (""moral panic"") so I think this also makes redditors more receptive.",0,1357374196,null,0,false,0,c7ree0b,t3_15yyop,t1_c7ree0b,t1_c7r7o34,null,1430862427,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

So when you said Corporations use public services and infrastructure that's exactly what business rates pay for.  Corporation tax doesn't because by the time it comes in and has entered the melting pot,  nobody knows what resource or infrastructure was used, or even what came from whom and where.  

Not so with business rates.  They know how much each authority collected and can compare neighbouring lines of communication, commerce and drains on services, resources - distributing it accordingly.

[EDIT]  Your link backs up what I said.  

Business rates are collected and set locally to be spent by local authorities on services and infrastructure.  They are collected locally, centralised, and then redistributed.  You know that if a factory opens up which makes the roads busier, calls for more parking or even out of town redevelopment that it is the business rates paying for it.  Once Corporation taxes are collected there's no way of spending them according to how they've been raised because by that stage it's all gone into a melting pot.

It's not an opinion.  It's a fact.  A business rate goes back towards the region where the money was raised, so if there's a company there using infrastructure or putting a demand on services it's the business rates that will offset it.  Corporation tax on a company in Newcastle might never see Newcastle again other than being spent on a fine spread across the whole of the UK.

It's even been in the news recently with the Barnett Formula in that business rates once centralised have only been going partially back out to parts of Wales and Scotland, and why on devolution autonomy of business rate relocation is first in line.

It's the intentions behind why you're learning certain facts though, and the intention here is to give students a more balanced perspective of history and what was going on from all angles back then.

First, I agree that kids *should* learn history.  I'm really not sure why you think anything I've said in any way supports the idea that they shouldn't.  My point is that there's no reason for the government to dictate precisely *which* history our kids should learn about, because there are many different historical periods and issues to choose from, all of which have valuable lessons to learn from, and all of which provide historical perspective, helping to explain how we got to where we are now.

If you're going to study the Crimean War, then Mary Seacole is probably going to be pretty high on your list of topics that you want to study, but what I'm really saying is that there's no reason that the Crimean War should have to be studied at all, and that including it on the history curriculum *necessarily* means that there are other historical periods that don't get studied.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"I agree, in theory. Corporations are by their nature international, ethereal and composed of people (people and shareholders in different ways). They're also more mobile and able to avoid tax than any other entity. Finally, the overwhelming effect of corporation tax is to penalise indigenous small businesses who actually pay it.

IMO the right system is to have VAT and a comprehensive, computerised, automated benefit system. In effect, everybody pays the top rate of tax by default (apart from on essentials). Then they have to register on top of that to have it offset. That way nobody can benefit from avoiding tax - only benefits can be got rid of. It also improves the income from tourism and foreign domiciles (who actually lose out by not registering to live here and receive benefits).

This way, you still tax purchases by a company, their employees and their share holders. Everything that we actually have a right to tax gets taxed.

Step 1. **Blink** sets up the universe and the possibilities and complexity of time travel (timey-wimey), and because we're seeing it through the eyes of a ""third party"" in the form of Sally Sparrow, we get introduced to the Doctor along with her, which helps breaking in a new viewer, without overwhelming them with existing plot lines.

Step 2. Explain the sonic screwdriver and answer questions about the TARDIS.

Step 3. **The Girl in the Fireplace** gives us a look into the humanity, romanticism and selflessness of The Doctor (and the series) and at the same time, the sadness of time travel and being a Timelord.

Step 4. Explain regeneration and how there have been many doctors.

Step 5. (optional) **Silence in the Library** &amp; **Forest of the Dead** - first step into complex stories involving virtual realities, invisible enemies, mysteries that need solving - and of course, the problems with time travel as demonstrated by the introduction of the glorious River Song.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"I want Rodgers to be our last external appointment for a few decades, and a return to the bootroom tradition that Shankley setup. 

There are a lot of parallels here where Rodgers can be seen as Shankley 2.0. Shankley came in at a time when the club was in crisis, having only been promoted back to the top flight and not having won the top division in a long time or any other minor trophy. We also had no European victories. The last 4 seasons at Liverpool, while not as long as the poor era we had then, is similar in that we have won little and are not competing at the top of the league.

Shankley set the club up from top to bottom. From tactics and training methodologies, through to communicating with fans and the community. He instilled pass n' move at all levels of the club, setup a recruitment and player management philosophy, established a large team of coaches around him who he would meet with almost every day, a respect for opposition clubs and opposing coaches, etc.

I'd like to see Rodgers do this at Liverpool now. Setup his play style at all levels of the club, setup a player management system where we don't pay large wages to young players, where we don't buy stars but create them. Shankley didn't have the best trophy return rate of the Liverpool managers, but it was his foundation upon which the later success of the club was built on.

So with that in mind I would like to see Carragher join the coaching team soon. Our most successful managers were all first time managers with no previous experience, but they had all graduated from being bootroom coaches. There is something about the bootroom tradition that works. No need to re-invent the club every 2-3 years with a new manager. Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish were all first time managers and are the 3 most successful managers the club has had.

I would like to see Carragher, and possibly others, used in the same way. There is no need to send them anywhere else, they can learn everything they need to know right here at the club, working with the youth team and reserve teams and in the coaching circle.

Presumably they'd only really need connection to the first major postal hub, but by the same measure I'm absolutely certain there's plenty of industrial space and old manufacturing plants turning 28 Days Later in the West Midlands.

I do feel though there is a real opportunity for the first European government to tackle it and to actually harness these large Internet phenomenons which can operate out of practically anywhere.

true,BosskOnASegway,null,null,"It doesn't necessarily make the work poor. It makes the author or artist bad at their job. The audience determines whether a work is good or bad. If everyone likes it, its a good work. The author is still failing to do their job well, but hey people like bad authors and artists works all the time, take Twilight. The author is absolutely awful at conveying any sort of intented message, but people still seem to like the books. To put bluntly, even a blind man hits the bullseye once in a while.

Edit: I reread this an realized its slightly unclear. I mean to say that the artist merit of the work and its view in popular culture can be completely dispondent. Artistic merit is directly related to how well the artist crafted their work. If the art is writing, their whole craft is conveying a specific message if the message is unclear they failed at their craft. The work can still have value and other interpretations can be interesting but in my opinion the artist failed. As I said though, it is a very subjective topic and my opinion is fairly radical compared to most modern thought. I am a firm believer that the craft is what is important and a carefully crafted work will have a clear intent.

Edit 2:  As to the question of ambiguity, intentional ambiguity can be a very good way to add depth.  If ambiguity increases your enjoyment of a work, whether intentional or not, then the work is clearly improved but that is subjective.  I think accidental ambiguity is a failing on the artists part.  A work should have intent behind every word or brush stroke.  Any ambiguity should be purely intentional.   As I said its very subjective.

Surely a fair tax system should be based on a proportion of your discretionary income? So should make a small allowance for the necessary expenses involved in bringing up children (by which I mean basic necessities, not school fees and a nanny).

Just because someone is earning above average doesn't mean they aren't entitled to be taxed fairly, in comparison with other people who earn similar amounts. It's a bit like saying if you earn £57K, let's just pretend you earn £60K and use that to calculate your tax. You won't miss it.

true,winsurfer,null,null,"I did my undergrad at Imperial and am currently doing my postgrad at Cambridge. I don't know Cambridge undergrad life as well as a Cambridge undergrad would obviously, and I did CompSci rather than Physics, but I'll offer my insight.

* From what I know there's a definite Jazz scene at Cambridge. Jazz@John's is always a good night, and there's also Clare Jazz and the Jazz orchestra. I think the scene at Cambridge university is better than the scene at Imperial, but obviously not better than the scene in London as a whole.

* It is artificially difficult to get a first at Cambridge, most people get 2:1s despite being highly intelligent and motivated. I think this is a prestige thing. One thing I'll say though is that while a Cambridge first is more impressive than an Imperial one, an Imperial first is more impressive than a Cambridge 2:1, and nothing you apply for will reject you because you have an Imperial first rather than a Cambridge first.

* The course quality is the same, at least for my field. Cambridge has a slightly more theoretical bent to it, with Imperial being slightly more practical, but I was able to get a theoretical background just by picking the right modules.

* You are taught the same material, but at Cambridge you have 8 weeks in a term to learn it, and at Imperial you have 11 weeks. Cambridge has more stressful terms, and more stressful breaks (as you spend the time catching up rather than relaxing).

* Imperial only does STEM courses, this leads to less variety in the people you'll meet and much fewer girls.

* At Cambridge it is easier to have a good time, lots of activities and cultural things will be shoved down your throat. At Imperial you'll have to go and find these things more, but since it is London it's all there to be found.

* The nightlife in London is in a completely different league, and since everyone lives in private accommodation you don't get your parties shut down at 12am by the porters.

* London is more expensive than Cambridge, but not much (Cambridge is an expensive place).

* Imperial is more employable, but there's not much difference either way if you do well.

* If you go to an old college in Cambridge you get to live in a castle.

Considering you want to be an academic, and you like Jazz, I would say Cambridge, but it's difficult to know what you'll want after four years of an undergraduate degree. I personally took the offer at Imperial because I wanted to live in London, and the courses were of comparable quality.

It's like Hofstadter's comment on The Singularity

&gt;&gt; Do you share Kurzweil's view of hardware being able to execute human soul software within the foreseeable future? Do you agree with his view of this being the equivalent of immortality — will the software running on the electronic brain be the same “I”?
&gt;
&gt; I think Ray Kurzweil is terrified by his own mortality and deeply longs to avoid death. I understand this obsession of his and am even somehow touched by its ferocious intensity, but I think it badly distorts his vision. As I see it, Kurzweil's desperate hopes seriously cloud his scientific objectivity.
&gt;
&gt; I think Kurzweil sees technology as progressing so deterministically fast (Moore's Law, etc.) that inevitably, within a few decades, hardware will be so fast and nanotechnology so advanced that things unbelievable to us now will be easily doable. A key element in this whole vision is that no one will need to understand the mind or brain in order to copy a particular human's mind with perfect accuracy, because trillions of tiny “nanobots” will swarm through the bloodstream in the human brain and will report back all the “wiring details” of that particular brain, which at that point constitute a very complex table of data that can be fed into a universal computer program that executes neuron-firings, and presto — that individual's mind has been reinstantiated in an electronic medium. (This vision is quite reminiscent of the scenario painted in my piece “A Conversation with Einstein's Brain” toward the end of The Mind's I, actually, with the only difference being that there is no computer processing anything — it's all done in the pages of a huge book, with a human being playing the role of the processor.)
&gt;
&gt; Rather ironically, this vision totally bypasses the need for cognitive science or AI, because all one needs is the detailed wiring plan of a brain and then it's a piece of cake to copy the brain in other media. And thus, says Kurzweil, we will have achieved immortal souls that live on (and potentially forever) in superfast computational hardware — and Kurzweil sees this happening so soon that he is banking on his own brain being thus “uploaded” into superfast hardware and hence he expects (or at least he loudly proclaims that he expects) to become literally immortal — and not in the way Chopin is quasi-immortal, with just little shards of his soul remaining, but with his whole soul preserved forever.
&gt;
&gt; Well, the problem is that a soul by itself would go crazy; it has to live in a vastly complex world, and it has to cohabit that world with many other souls, commingling with them just as we do here on earth. To be sure, Kurzweil sees those things as no problem, either — we'll have virtual worlds galore, “up there” in Cyberheaven, and of course there will be souls by the barrelful all running on the same hardware. And Kurzweil sees the new software souls as intermingling in all sorts of unanticipated and unimaginable ways.
&gt;
&gt; Well, to me, this “glorious” new world would be the end of humanity as we know it. If such a vision comes to pass, it certainly would spell the end of human life. Once again, I don't want to be there if such a vision should ever come to pass. But I doubt that it will come to pass for a very long time. How long? I just don't know. Centuries, at least. But I don't know. I'm not a futurologist in the least. But Kurzweil is far more “optimistic” (i.e., depressingly pessimistic, from my perspective) about the pace at which all these world-shaking changes will take place.
&gt;
&gt; In any case, the vision that Kurzweil offers (and other very smart people offer it too, such as Hans Moravec, Vernor Vinge, perhaps Marvin Minsky, and many others — usually people who strike me as being overgrown teen-age sci-fi addicts, I have to say) is repugnant to me. On the surface it may sound very idealistic and utopian, but deep down I find it extremely selfish and greedy. “Me, me, me!” is how it sounds to me — “I want to live forever!” But who knows? I don't even like thinking about this nutty technology-glorifying scenario, now usually called “The Singularity” (also called by some “The Rapture of the Nerds” — a great phrase!) — it just gives me the creeps. Sorry!

But I suppose we're already two disembodied entities talking to each other in cyberspace, so perhaps it's not as bad as Hofstadter says. Mind you at least we still remember all the good and bad things that have happened to us and the people we care about and thus have some depth to us. A technology that could edit out all bad memories - which I'm sure isn't that far off - seems to me to be a major step backward.

true,IneffablePigeon,TrinityHall,Trinity Hall,"I got an offer from both in CompSci. Personally there was no contest, since I ranked Cambridge slightly above Imperial on my list of choices, and Imperial's offer was quite a reasonable amount higher, so I chose Cambridge.

I'm just about to start my second term, and I'd say that I agree with pretty much everything winsurfer's said. There's definitely jazz to get involved in at Cambridge, if that's what you want to do.

The term lengths at Cambridge are definitely something to consider. I was expecting a tough ride, but damn - those first 8 weeks are intense. If you're the kind of person who likes to take your time over learning new material, you might want to consider that. If you're the kind of person who likes to be challenged, it might be perfect - just bear it in mind. 

Also to bear in mind: I don't know what the situation's like at Imperial, but at Cambridge the NatScis (along with the first year CompScis) basically treat Saturday as a weekday - including 9am Maths lectures. So that can be exhausting by the end of term.

I can't speak to the social life in London, but I assume it's everything you could want, but a bit harder to find than in Cambridge. The people I've met in Cambridge are great, and there seems to be somebody from every part of the world and with every interest here. The nightlife exists, but if you're looking for good clubs you might be disappointed - it's all quite cheesy around here. If you hunt around a bit more, though, there are some great regular jazz events, and London's definitely within easy train reach for gigs and things.

Cambridge is a fairly expensive place to live, but that is offset by the facts that a) you probably wouldn't be living here for as much of the year and b) the accommodation is generally subsidised by the colleges, so the room prices are quite reasonable compared to other universities.

It's probably a reasonable amount cheaper than London if you're comparing it with Imperial.

On balance, I'd go for Cambridge, but then I'm biased because I already did.",0,1357393837,null,0,1357394068,0,c7rgpzk,t3_1604u1,t1_c7rgpzk,t3_1604u1,null,1430863596,6,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,6

Courtesy of BBC Sport.


**Head to head**

•	These clubs have met 91 times competitively; Birmingham have won 35, Leeds 33, and 23 have been drawn.

•	Birmingham registered their fourth successive Championship victory over Leeds with a 1-0 win at Elland Road in October, when Leroy Lita's goal separated the sides.

•	They have met four times in the FA Cup, the most recent being a 3-0 home win for Birmingham in the third round in 2005. Leeds won the other three, included a 3-0 triumph (Mick Jones 2, Peter Lorimer) at Hillsborough in the semi-final in April 1972, before defeating Arsenal in the final at Wembley.

**Leeds United**

•	Leeds face Midland opposition, having met only north London giants Tottenham and Arsenal in their last five FA Cup outings (three ties) since February 2010.

•	The 1972 winners are chasing their 100th victory in FA Cup history, but they have qualified for the fourth round just once in nine years, and are eager to avoid a hat-trick of third round exits.

•	The 5-1 loss to Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup, is the only time Leeds have failed to win in their last six league and cup games at Elland Road.

**Birmingham City**

•	Birmingham, the 1931 and 1956 runners-up, last made a third round exit in January 2009, when beaten by local rivals Wolves. That was the only time in the last eight occasions Blues have lost when drawn against Championship clubs; they have won the last four.

•	Blues have been quarter-finalists in two of the last three seasons, reaching the fifth round last term.

•	This is one of four ties that guarantees a Championship club in the fourth round.",0,1357394765,null,0,false,0,c7rgu5n,t3_1609t2,t1_c7rgu5n,t3_1609t2,null,1430863643,5,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,5

I believe the Duke William won last year. 

Explanation: Teams are divided between Pubs, of which there are 4 in contention. 

• The Duke William (Haxey)
• The Loco (Locomotive) (Haxey)
• The Kings Arms (Haxey)
• The Carpenters Arms (Westwood side)

Though the pubs are between two villages, the distance between the villages is approximately 200m-300m, it is in this space that the event starts. 

The Duke William is closest, followed by the Locomotive just a few doors down, the Kings Arms is (at a guess) 0.5 miles from the start point. The Carpenters is about the same distance as the Kings Arms is from the start point, though it is in the opposite direction. 

The game ends when the Hood arrives at one of the pubs and is touched by the landlord from his front step. The landlord then takes charge of the Hood for the year, and is supposed to give everyone a free drink. The winning pub pours beer over the Hood and then hangs it behind the bar (each pub has two hooks especially for this purpose). According to legend, it used to be roasted on a spit over the pub fire having been doused with ale, which was then drunk by those present.",0,1357399119,null,0,false,0,c7rhi3k,t3_1607b3,t1_c7rhi3k,t1_c7rhc14,null,1430863957,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"So here are my half-time thoughts:

Birmingham have been shading this game, maybe even holding a comfortable edge over us. And there's one reason for it: pace. They have Redmond up front, who has used his pace to get in behind us numerous times. They also have Elliot and Burke on the wings who aren't slouches (they aren't the quickest, but Elliot skipped past Norris for his goal, with Norris being so slow that he couldn't catch up to him) and Ravel Morrison, whom we know has some pace.

We've been putting some nice pressure on Birmingham at times, and I especially like how we've been trying to play it with the ball on the deck more (we can't, really, as their two centre halves - Caldwell and Davies - are well suited to balls in the air) but we let them off the hook for too easily. Even worse, they use their pace to launch counter-attacks that cut us open far too easily. Our defence has been much more stretched than theirs.

We've also had some really poor decisions in the final third. Norris chose to shoot from a narrow angle when White was in a good position for the ball to be cut back to him. I think Norris has also hit a cross in low and hard once or twice, when a dink to the back post was for more favourable. We seem to be sending McCormack out wide, more often than not, to get the ball in while Norris runs into the box to cover his position. So far, I don't think it's been working.

I think that Diouf and Byram would be two good players to bring on. What we need are players not only willing to run at their defence, but, unlike White, capable of doing so. Somma might also be a decent shout, but I suppose more rustiness in the final third wouldn't be great.

Edit: just as I post this, Ryan Hall has been subbed off for Sam Byram, while El Hadji Diouf has come on for Aidan White, which is what I would have done. However, I can't help but feel sorry for Hall, as fans were audibly yelling for him to be taken off.",0,1357401744,null,0,false,0,c7ri0e0,t3_1609t2,t1_c7ri0e0,t3_1609t2,null,1430864197,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

Aside from that though, I'm saying it's all irrelevant because my original point was not that we should allow them but simply that depictions of child molestation however distasteful they are are not morally equivalent to photographs of actual incidents because no one has been harmed in the production of a drawing.

true,xilog,eng-devon,Devon,"&gt; So your justification for this interference in the family unit is, well it could be worse, at least they're not mandatorily aborting foetuses or killing babies?

To an extent, yes.  Aborting foetuses or euthanising neonates is, in my view, an acceptable yet unsavoury solution.

Negative emotion and harm to the parents from separation, yes, but one can weight their negative utility more lightly since they made either an active or negligent choice to procreate in the full knowledge that they couldn't afford a child and were therefore inviting the negative utility, and weight the positive utility of the end result for the child more heavily since it has a ""good"" upbringing (note the quotes please, I make no judgement as to what ""good"" actually means outside the context of being financially stable), will have no negative feelings at the separation since it will be too young to lay down those memories and is the ""innocent"" party in what has transpired.

Helping the vulnerable in society is all well and good, but the methodology of how that's done is very difficult.  In this discussion I'm suggesting that the maximum utility lies with relocation of the child with adoptive parents rather than handing out cash that may or may not be used for its intended purpose and which, on its own, will not feed and clothe a child and where the child will have a sub-par upbringing in a life of relative poverty compared to what it could have had if adopted.",0,1357406231,null,0,false,0,c7rj2ew,t3_16002n,t1_c7rj2ew,t1_c7ristj,null,1430864694,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

However, my stance has been softened after hearing from Mick Jones on *Yorkshire Radio*, with him clearly sounding unwell (he admitted that he'd tried to stay away from the dressing room as much as possible, due to being stricken with the same virus Warnock and Austin have). It sounds like they've been really struggling with so many players falling ill and not being fully fit - Jones admitted that they hadn't even been able to prepare properly, due to the plague sweeping through Thorpe Arch.

edit: same with having a running count of the number of followers you have:

&gt; 7 followers away from 100, RT? #LFC

Your first few dozen tweets were about nothing other than getting followers or asking people to follow you. You did one tweet of [actual content](https://twitter.com/LFCEcho/status/287591237182164993), and then follow on with a couple dozen more tweets asking people to follow you.

This, and the @ replying and asking for retweets is also a very quick way to get your account marked as spam and then suspended. It is against both the terms of twitter and the ethos of twitter. Most users of Twitter see this as an annoyance, and this is the part of twitter that gives it a bad reputation, despite it being a great medium for content and stories. That is not to mention that it comes across as immature and amateur .

You become popular and a good source worth following with good content. At the moment you don't have enough. Honestly, it is very difficult to differentiate what you have done so far from spam.

Thatcher, IIRC, decided that breweries had too much power over the chain from manufacture to consumption and forced them to relinquish their pubs. 

Almost overnight, a bunch of companies sprang up to buy the pubs from breweries. These companies lease the pub to landlords - generally people with some sort of romantic dream about running their own pub. The landlord hands over his redundancy money from his last job/life savings to the pub company in exchange for the lease. This dream quickly evaporates once they learn that the pub company will put all sorts of rules in the lease like ""you must buy your beer from us"" and then charge 30-40% more than what it should cost wholesale. Usually within a year or two the landlord will give up and walk away - which doesn't bother the pub company because they'll sell the lease again to some other silly bugger with a dream (which there seems to be an almost unlimited supply of).

How can I justify abortion and euthanasia?  It's not easy to describe but I'll give it a shot.

I don't subscribe to any of the ""sanctity of life"" arguments that are out there.  Taking a utilitarian viewpoint means that one has to be able to *measure* utility in some way and the metric proposed by Singer *et al* is the achievement or otherwise of preferences, e.g. I wish to take a walk outside; if I can do so my preference is satisfied, if I cannot it is frustrated.  In order to be able to express a preference and exhibit a reaction to its satisfaction or frustration one must be, to some degree, sentient and self aware.  Fetuses are certainly no position to be able to express any preference or reaction to it, neither are neonates.  At what point the organism becomes self aware enough to express preference or respond to its satisfaction or otherwise is highly debatable, but certainly it is several weeks from birth.

Well, this has become a little academic for what started out as a briefly stated opinion, and as much as I'd like to continue it whilst my brain is in discussion mode, I'm afraid I have to go and get shat, shaved and showered ready to attempt to satisfy one of my own preferences, i.e. go out with some friends for an evening of Indian food gluttony.

- Arsenal

It's going to be a tough month. But I expect that we should be able to get the one against Norwich, draw against Arsenal, probably lose to City, and probably lose to United. I expect it to be close with United, but we're at their ground and we barely held on at Anfield, even with being a man down. 

All in all, I see us getting 4 points from this month. We're three behind Arsenal right now, but they have a game in hand. Arsenal should take 6 points, leaving us 4 behind them. Everton will probably take 7; tying Swansea, beating Southampton, and Aston Villa, but losing to West Brom and United.

Same for the Master, whose origins we know even less of.

In this shop, you have ten cartons of eggs which are short-dated and you need to get rid of. But you know for a fact you would normally only sell a couple of boxes a day. Supply, in this case, exceeds demand.

In order to try and stimulate demand (and hence sell those eggs before they go off), you cut the price of the eggs.

Okay, switch things around a bit. Now you have ten boxes of eggs - but your suppliers have a problem. They can't supply anything like as many eggs as they usually would - the reason isn't really important - but Delia Smith has just been on telly with a show encouraging everyone to bake sponge cakes. You won't get your usual delivery this week. It seems every customer coming in wants eggs. At the rate you're going, you'll sell out within an hour.

You now have a problem. Once this lot of eggs is out, you don't know when the next delivery will be nor do you know if it'll have the same number of eggs or if you'll be getting fewer. You've still got rent to pay, staff on the payroll, heating and lighting bills - but come the end of the week, you might not have any more eggs to sell to pay those bills.

There's only one way to deal with this. You put your prices up.

A blog isn't quite ""just a website"", what it would more specifically imply is a chronological series of updates, around a common topic or topics, probably facilitated via tagging, plus the ability to comment, subscribe etc.  There are [various platforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog_software) that have this functionality, wordpress is probably the biggie these days.  Not listed there is blogger/blogspot from google.

I started a [personal blog](http://stevekeiretsu.blogspot.co.uk) there last year (been shit at updating it though), it's... ok.  It's really easy although it has an air of being a bit limited.  Fine by me, I have only minimal requirements, but I'm not sure I'd stick with it if I planned to build up my blog with multiple authors, customised functionality, a desire to run it for profit, etc. 

We use wordpress at work.  It seems a lot more ""power user"".  More complicated to set up and administer, if you're doing that, although wordpress also do free 'software as a service'  accounts I'm pretty sure, like google.  Presumably that would make it easy although also remove some of your power user ability to install arbitrary combinations of plugins.  I'm not sure.

I'd expect them all to have rss - weird if you are finding blogs without it.
