Carrico is another player I wouldn't be surprised to see leave. He was an odd signing from Brian and played nearly no role at all in our last season.

In terms of defence I think we'll be solid now Pearcey has renewed his contract. Gorkss is certainly surplus to requirements.

Honestly I think our chances of actually signing Hooper are very low. There's several decent premier league clubs who've shown an interest in him which I'd be surprised to see him snub in favour of us. A more realistic target would be someone like Billy Sharp who's a proven goal scorer at this level and has now been told he can leave by Southampton, although obviously I'd be overjoyed if we do end up signing Hooper.

Adkins does seem to have more ambition than BMD did. BMD was extremely good at making the most of what he had on a tight budget. I still don't know who to believe between him and Anton on whether or not he spent all of his available budget when we got promoted but Adkins is definitely better at getting in big names to the club - Brian was signing championship and league one players like Akpan and Blackman to try and keep us up in the premiership while Adkins is bringing in players from the Bundesliga after we've been relegated.

&gt;Rent control in New York City
Rent control is a price ceiling on rent. When soldiers returned from World War II and started families (which increased demand for apartments), but stopped receiving military pay, many could not deal with the jumping rent. The government put in price controls, so soldiers and their families could pay the rent and keep their homes. However, this increased the quantity demanded for apartments and lowered the quantity supplied, meaning that available apartments were rapidly taken until none were left for late-comers. Price ceilings create shortages when producers are allowed to abdicate market share or go unsubsidized.

&gt;Apartment price control in Finland
According to professors Niko Määttänen and Ari Hyytinen, price ceilings on Helsinki City Hitas apartments are economically highly inefficient. They cause queuing, and discriminate against the handicapped, single parents, elderly, and others not able to queue for days. They cause inefficient allocation, as apartments are not bought by those willing to pay the most for them—and those who get an apartment are unwilling to leave it, even when their family or work situation changes, since they can't sell it at what they feel the market price should be. These inefficiencies increase apartment shortage and raise the market price of other apartments.

&gt;A January 10, 2006, BBC article reported that since 2003, Venezuela President Hugo Chávez had been setting price ceilings on food, and that these price ceilings had caused shortages and hoarding. A January 22, 2008 article from Associated Press stated, ""Venezuelan troops are cracking down on the smuggling of food... the National Guard has seized about 750 tons of food... Hugo Chavez ordered the military to keep people from smuggling scarce items like milk... He's also threatened to seize farms and milk plants..."" On February 28, 2009 Chávez ordered the military to temporarily seize control of all the rice processing plants in the country and force them to produce at full capacity, which he alleged they had been avoiding in response to the price caps.

So Ladies and Gentlemen, what are you suggesting to be done to curb the ways of the ""evil"" landlords? Something akin to El Presidente for Life (until he died) Chávez?",0,1373328224,null,0,false,0,cayknop,t3_1hrvo4,t1_cayknop,t1_caxk0z3,null,1430538278,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Actually studies consistently show that the NHS offers one of the highest value-for-money systems anywhere in the world. Arguably, if the NHS does anything well it is the extent of its cost effectiveness. Indeed there is little evidence to backup the oft-mentioned high levels of waste. Much of this stems from the fact the NHS is simply such a vast organisation. Though I will conceed that there are some significant structural ineffecencies that could be addressed, and indeed many of them have been over the past 3 years due to the need to find effiecny savings.

As far as it being ""*fit for purpose*"" that is difficult to say either way - since the 'purpose' of the NHS isn't constitutionally enshrined -- In effect, the purpose of the NHS is to do whatever the department of health tells it to do. Post-war it was setup to provide healthcare to demobilising forces personnel and ensure the health of younger working age adults that would power Britains post-war economic recovery... of course these days it has crept into caring for the extremely elderly (ironically - the very same generation it was actually created to care for) which has become its bread and butter workload.

On the NHS being antiquated I would agree in part. Healthcare as a global industry innovates in some areas, and lags behind in others. One area where healthcare is notoriously stuck in the dark ages is IT. For example most NHS hospitals still run Internet explorer 6 or 7, most records are paper-based and there are many other extraordinary IT black holes. BUT, the NHS also pioneers in other areas, both organisational and clinical. The focus on multidisciplinary working, the incorporation of new clinical technoligies and the way the system is regulated are actually fairly advanced as healthcare systems go. Staff training is another area of excellence, and through organisations like the Royal Colleges the UK exerts a lot of influence on international medicine. The bottom line though is that getting out of some of those antiquated ruts requires investment which nobody can afford right now.",0,1373331098,null,0,false,0,caylnug,t3_1hv08r,t1_caylnug,t1_cayhmxw,null,1430537805,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,NotMud,null,null,"At a very basic level, house names ensure that every address in the UK is unique. *House Name, Street Name, Village* is a format which ensures that letters get to the right house, provided there's only one house on the street with that name.

The alternative is house numbers (which are more common). House numbers were introduced by Parliament in the 18th Century, and are very useful when straight rows of houses are all built at the same time. This is another way to ensure that every house in the UK has a unique address - *4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging* is probably the most common format in the UK.

But many of the UK's residential areas are the result of several centuries' worth of building. Jessamine Cottage in St Albans, for example, shares a street with a 15th Century pub, some handsome 18th Century buildings, a few Victorian houses, some modern stuff and plenty more in between. Some of them have numbers, others have names, and some have both, because it's difficult to retrospectively apply a single regimented system to a haphazardly-arranged collection of buildings.

Even houses in a neat row can be built at different times to each other. What happens when somebody builds a house between numbers 5 and 6? 5.5? Five-and-a-half? Easier to call it 'Lavender House' and be done with it.

Large houses (manors and castles) have always needed their own names. Big estates have names based on the families that lived there or the land that they controlled, so there's always been a history of giving houses names. Obviously if you've got a castle, it needs a name. This filters down to more urban houses, where the owners would want an interesting or pleasant-sounding name rather than a boring old number. Some houses have both!

tl;dr because some houses are old, some aren't in neat rows, and because people like words rather than numbers",0,1373336510,null,0,false,0,caynnm1,t3_1hwjx1,t1_caynnm1,t3_1hwjx1,null,1430536866,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

10's first contact was with a family unit. He sort of struck me as the goofy brother and he was fiercely protective of his companions to the point of being self sacrificing to save them. He also mentions his family from Gallifrey more often and treats the Master like a long lost brother, if not the black sheep of the family.

11's first contact is with a child, and it sort of rubs off on him. He's very goofy and acts like a spoiled kid sometimes. Plus he's super hyper, a lot like a child on too much sugar. He also has tantrums and sometimes kind of acts shameful like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

Plenty of players hand in transfer requests, and don't leave the club for a while. Look at Rooney. 

If I were Paul Lambert, I would say to Benteke that we can give him regular first-team football this season, which is crucial for his World Cup chances. If he doesn't play regularly this year, there is a chance that he won't be picked for Belgium (As it looks like they will qualify). 

I would accept a decent offer for Benteke (£15m plus), but make it a prerequisite that we are loaned him back for the upcoming season. This would benefit both parties. Benteke would be eager to score goals to impress his new boss and the Belgium coach, Villa would have a year to plan for his departure and the fans would know where they stand. 

We won't be buying a world-class striker to replace him, but I don't think we need one. Weimann is looking better every season, and we don't know how Helenius will do.

I know they have their opinions, and thats cool man, but its annoying when their opinions are nitpicking and missing the point and knocking off the show at the same time. 

And I guess I didn't mean every aspect of the show was being turned into a gender studies essay, but any aspect is seemingly up for unecissary scrutiny. For example someone the detail that the Tardis had been personified as a woman sounds like an entry in some sci-fi gender blog. That just bugs me that the show has to comb through every detail and make sure its PC. And I'm obviously not talking about checking for the blatant -isms, I'm talking about when they have to examine minor details to make sure it isn't offending everyone. 

And yeah I know I shouldn't read about it, (I said that in my original post) but I also think that if people get upset by the miniscule amount of debatable offensive material, then they should just not watch and not ruin it for the people who don't see it. (Again i'm not saying sweep actual offensive stuff under the rug, but in the ""everyone is offended by everything age"", no one will ever be pleased).

And lastly, I come from an extremely liberal town, and even tho I identify as a liberal myself, it can be quite irksome. That being said there are many feminists that I am friends with, have hung out with and casually talked to. I have nothing against them (my girlfriend is one), but for some reason there is a large amount who just hate Doctor Who. When they find out I'm a fan all they ever want to talk about is how the show is sexist, if he's an alien who can turn into anything why is he always a man, why can't women fly the tardis, why do people think its ok that the Doctor figuratively ""raped"" donna (yes I have heard that one) etc. I don't mind telling them that I'm just a fan and can't answer those questions, but I'm just tired of the general ""blogging"" nature of gender discussions in Doctor Who.",0,1373349560,null,0,false,0,cays55o,t3_1hu3lr,t1_cays55o,t1_cayawwc,null,1430534680,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Real Madrid tap him up and he falls for the bait, and now when they don't follow through since their intention was only to trip LFC up and not pay the full 60M euro, he is stuck after having said too much. 

The Real Madrid game plan was for Suarez to file a transfer request, which won't happen since it doesn't match the narrative and he would miss bonuses and for that along with his comments to drive Liverpool into a cheap sale.

We also don't seem to like giving out 4 year deals, (correct me if I'm wrong) all contracts handed out this summer have been 3 year deals on fairly low wages to make the players earn their extension/pay rise.  

In my calculations, if we get £24m we also save £6m in wages leaving £30m in total, we sign 3 players at an average of £7m each and an average wage of £20k/week and things are looking a lot more rosy.

1) Politeness - Patronising understates the shit out of that! There is an 80% call for my being polite at work, which I pride myself on delivering. There is also the 20% whereby being ""pink and fluffy"" is not an approach worth taking.
People lie to me regularly and occasionally, these people need firm words to get facts out of them.
Similarly, at a pub fight when there are 100+ people rubbernecking and getting in the way, or obstructing Ambulance crews etc, I will need to shout to be heard, I will have to be concise to be quick in a hectic emergency situation. These are not ""polite"" or ideal things and they rub the self-entitled minority up the wrong way, but it's sometimes necessary in a less than ideal world. I've got some blinding stories about the arrogance of humanity, up to and including the girl that complained about me for not letting her walk through a murder scene because it was in the way of her walk home... She never did show any humanity toward the victim, just called me a cunt for making her walk an extra 15 metres; that's what you're up against!

2) Merging all 3 services. It would appear he's thought of an RTC where all turn up and do process driven tasks each. Simply wouldn't work, the firemen turn up in a set number to make the place safe and extract casualties; the paramedics work around them to deal with injuries; the police close the road and investigate the matter... Although the saving life and limb element is the common theme, the roles are too different to merge.
I've got a fantastic legal knowledge and an investigative mind; I can make quick decisions around points of law and think like a copper. I can catch criminals and I'm good at it but...
You want me to Intubate someone? No chance! I'm too clumsy with my hands. Want me to don breathing apparatus and get a hose out? No chance, not my cup of tea at all, heat brings up my eczema.

This goes for management too, they're at crossed purposes in equal measure sometimes and their train sets are all running on different gauged tracks that cannot physically be merged if you want them to be effective.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"If you're a complete novice, and assuming that you're specifically interested in web development, then you absolutely have to start with HTML and CSS.  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is what web pages are written in and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is what's used to make them look pretty.  I'd recommend starting with [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html) and working through the examples.

The next step is Javascript.  [This page](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/the-best-way-to-learn-javascript/) has some good advice about how to do that.  [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a *very* popular (near ubiquitous) library for Javascript that you absolutely have to learn alongside Javascript (mainly because Javascript without jQuery can be a real pain).  Bootstrap includes some [jQuery plugins](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html) which will give you a good introduction to how HTML/CSS/JS all fit together.

You should be able to learn the basics in a few hours and get to the point where you can start building basic web sites.  It'll probably take a few months to get proficient (at which point you might be able to land a junior web developer position).  I'd expect a junior web developer to progress to being a ""normal"" web developer within a year or two, so you're still talking about less time than a university course.

After getting your head around HTML/CSS/JS, the next step is to learn a server-side programming language.  
The choices here are Perl, Python, Ruby or PHP.  

PHP is the odd one out here.  As programming languages go, PHP is complete shit.   However, it's a fantastically convenient and useful way to quickly build dynamic web pages (badly). It's widely used by web designers/developers everywhere and demand for PHP developers is always high (at least it is down here in the South East).  It's definitely worth learning but don't fall into the trap of confusing it with a ""real"" programming language like Perl/Python/Ruby.  Think of it as a stepping stone.

Of those three languages, Perl is my personal choice - it's arguably the most powerful but at the cost of being the least user-friendly (particularly for novices).  It's also very much out of favour with the cool kids who are all using Python and Ruby these, so I'd recommend one of those instead (probably Python if you're a complete novice).  These web sites give a general overview of the languages and let you try out code examples in the browser.

  http://www.learnpython.org/

  http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0

The other language I mentioned is SQL (Structured Query Language) for talking to databases.  You won't need that initially, but it's something to think about for later.  It's another very marketable skill.

Hope that helps push you in the right direction.  Feel free to ask for clarification if there's anything I've skipped over.  

Also bear in mind that the most important skill for any web developer is the ability to self-learn.  There is no university course you can go on that will teach you what you need to know to be a web developer.  That's not to say that you won't learn many other useful skills, but pretty much anything related to web development will be outdated by the time you get into the trenches.  All the information you need it out there on the web.  Let Google be your guide.

I drove my car to the classroom session, but I was told that when you attend the riding session they will do a thorough check of you bike. He said if you've anything ""wrong"" with the bike they'd not take you out. He had also heard of officers issuing tickets to the people that turned up on a few occasions more than one ticket to the same bike.

I asked what he meant by ""wrong"" and he confirmed it would include after market exhausts if they were marked for ""race use only"" or missing cat etc.  Non BS-Stamped indicators / lights - i.e. 90% of the LED set you buy from ebay. Smaller/altered number plates. Just about anything they could think of. He said on some occasions they asked a VOSA inspector to come along too. I don't know if you're familiar with a VOSA inspector but they know absolutely everything about what is/isnt road legal, wont miss a thing and are generally as anal as they come.

My bikes arent unsafe but both have either cats deleted and/or a race exhaust. I also run a 5*7 plate. I dont think either of these things make me a bad rider. But he advised me to ""either return it to factory spec before arriving or not bother"". I didn't bother, seemed a shame I really wanted the ride out part more than the class room stuff. I ended up going back to the training school i passed my test with and an advanced session with them.

In fairness he did seem like a nice bloke and told me about it upfront, but at the end of the session he did ask to see my bike, not sure what his intentions were but  I was still glad I had turned up in the car (- that has deleted cats and two four missing silencers but no one asked about that :-p )",0,1373359513,null,0,false,0,cayu6k2,t3_1hf7je,t1_cayu6k2,t3_1hf7je,null,1430533719,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

I also think people gave up on Ba too quickly, he will have settled in to the team; Gone through pre season with them and baring any injuries, I think he could find his Newcastle form again. 

Lukaku scored 17 last season. If he scores 17 this season, I'd be happy. Chances are with this midfield and Mourinho he could score around 20 which is excellent.

Torres...who knows? Not going anywhere so no point discussing, IMO. 

Having said all that, if Ibra or Rooney wanted to come here, I would welcome them with open arms. 

I think we need to get De Rossi and we're good for next season.

Edit: The thing I would most like is City sign Jovetic and we sign Dzeko. Doubt it happens though

At first there was only this little article in BBC football transfers



""Luis Suarez's agent Pere Guardiola travelled to Merseyside on Monday to discuss the striker's future with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and managing director Ian Ayre - and to reiterate it is the Uruguayan's wish to join a Champions League club.

""Guardiola held separate meetings, which were planned and understood to be amicable, with Rodgers and Ayre, at which Liverpool insisted their position had not changed and they wished to keep Suarez at Anfield.

""The agent, brother of Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola, did not submit any official transfer request on behalf of Suarez, who is currently on an extended break after playing for Uruguay in the Confederations Cup in Brazil.

""Liverpool have already rejected a £30m offer from Arsenal for Suarez, who has spoken publicly this summer about his disenchantment with life in England and what he regards as unfair treatment from the media.""
 
There is no mention that Suarez wants to leave to Champions League club or that he wants to leave at all....I though i would read misleading article like this in Daily Mail not in BBC.

If he wants to leave, he should man up and hand in a transfer request. If not he should keep quiet and prepare for next season. At the moment he is creating uncertainty about next season, and rodgers will need time to attempt to replace him.

If he is adamant on leaving, I hope we get as much money as possible from him, if he's happy to break his contract, we shouldn't just be happy to let him get his dream move to madrid in a cut price deal, just because it suits him.

He might be world class, but it doesn't give him the right to flirt with madrid while playing for liverpool.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I don't like the immigration rules as well because they are very inconvenient and annoying. I think it's really quite unfair to not allow the long term spouse of a British citizen to immigrate to the country. **BUT** I also understand the reason for the rules (even if I think they are completely overstated), to stop sham marriages being used to bring illegal immigrants in and stop people from coming here just to become unemployed (again, I want to stress that the home office *completely* blows out of proportion how big a problem this is, as if our entire social welfare budget is spent on immigrants, which it absolutely is not).

People who are genuinely hard working, but not very well paid, and their families, do suffer under these rules. Some are forced to stick to shitty dead-end jobs just to maintain employment above the threshold, even if they could find a better job with their skills, because the minute they quit their shit job, they lose their (or their spouse's) visa sponsorship and have no grace period to find another job.

However, even I have to agree with this comment here because the article really is a thinly veiled complaint that he can't get the government to pay for his wife's training. The author and his family is most likely quite well off. They can easily afford to move their whole family to the UK and live quite comfortably. Sure, the wife may need longer to get her qualification and they will have to pay out of pocket, but that's not really unreasonable to expect of a fairly well off family.

By making this childish complaint, he is completely trivialising the anguish of the people with serious, life changing problems with the immigration policy.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"It will be interesting to see what happens now. 

I assume the meeting with Ian Ayre was to clarify each side's position. From what we've been told, it wouldn't be wild speculation to believe that Ayre told them Liverpool will only consider offers of £40m and above from teams outside the PL; strong emphasis on 'consider' as opposed to 'accept'. 

With that in mind, I can see several things happening. 

*a)* Silence for a couple of weeks as Pere scouts out clubs around Europe in an attempt to find someone willing to part with so much money. A club is found and a transfer is taken to the next step. This should be finalised before or around the pre-season tours.

*b)* Silence for a while, for the same reasons as above, followed by another meeting and a formal transfer request, in an attempt to lower the price. This would seem like somewhat of a desperate gamble, as Luis will lose his substantial loyalty bonus and there's nothing preventing Liverpool from simply rejecting the request and sticking to their original conditions. I would expect things to get ugly after that. Of course, the transfer price could be lowered by the size of the loyalty bonus, now forfeited. 

*c)* A series of meetings between Guardiola/Suarez and the club will now follow. This could be a good sign, indicating that the player is willing to talk and perhaps be convinced to tone down his persecution rhetoric. 

Suarez stays for another year, we reach the Champions League, sell him for £50 million to a Real Madrid side about to enter a period of decline, whilst buying two talented young strikers to replace him, thus kickstarting a decade of European and domestic dominance.

1. Foundations for a title challenge need to be laid. If we're still in contention for 1st (or 2nd, in the case of a runaway leader like last season) at around February/March, specifically.

2. AVB stays. If AVB leaves, Bale leaves, no matter what, IMO. Either AVB gets sacked because we underperform, and then Bale leaves for a CL club, or AVB gets hired by one of the megarich clubs and does everything he can to bring Bale with him. Either way, we lose Bale.

3. Early statement signing in the summer. We'll have all season to see where we'll need to make that signing. But I think we'll need to bring in one legitimately world class player. It won't have to be a 30m+ pound signing because we're not that kind of club, but we'll have to make an early splash, and this goes along with 1, because at that point we'll be in the CL, presumably (otherwise Bale leaving would definitely happen and this discussion would be pointless). Something to show that we're intent on progressing from ""Challenging for top 4"" to ""Challenging for silverware.""

So basically we need to qualify for the CL and be considered a potential title challenger for 2014-15, I think, in addition to keeping AVB. Honestly, my biggest worry is if Monaco decides next season that they can do better than Claudio Ranieri and look to AVB to be their next manager.

I could see the joy in his face that he'd nailed me, a real 'got him!' look.

He then unwraps the foil to find an ancient and slightly furry piece of kitkat that had been sat forgotten in that pocket for months.

It's called common sense, something you should try applying 

those engaged with easily identifiable criminal activity are more likely to be  identified targeted by their clothes/style.

An old woman properly dressed is less likely to be a violent thug than a man in his 20's with a baseball cap and upturned collar in sports clothing and jewellery.

commonly this can and does get confused with ""racism"" in that if you just target a clothing/style people assume you are being racist however if people of the same race were all in suits walking down the road they would be completely ignored.

The police cannot stop and search who they wish, they must have reasonable suspicion, the police will judge you on your clothes/style  tattoos etc, its just common sense",0,1373369677,null,0,false,0,cayvkcl,t3_1hx5py,t1_cayvkcl,t1_cayvdjc,null,1430533072,-6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6

Later in the evening though I was walking through Piccadilly Sq with friends to get some food after a long day when suddenly I was dragged and scraped across the floor by two riot policemen and dropped on the floor behind two riot vans. It was a terrifying ordeal, I was shaken, not knowing what they were going to do to me next. I was stop a searched, I only had my camera and clothes in my bag. After searching my bag they said I was able to leave, they  even asked 'if I was okay'.

I thought it was appalling, moreover when they could've walked up to me and requested to speak to me 'Sorry, we need to do a stop and search from disorder which took place during the day' which I would've complied. Especially with incidents like Ian Tomlinson, for if I had a bad leg condition and this occurred I could've been worse off.

I talked to a Solicitor after this about my incident/experience. Though they said  because I had not said to them I requested not to be searched, they had a legal right to search me. If I had told them that 'I request not to be searched' - it would've been unlawful of them and the matter could've been taken further. Though I was so shaken at the time I didn't know what to even say to the police who detained me. 

Later that day I was recording trafalgar square where police began to cordon around the square because there was a gathering attempting to stay over night at the square. As I was recording, a policeman dressed in riot gear (baton and shield) screamed at me to 'move' and lunged at me. After going through what I did previously, I felt reluctant to take any chances reasoning with him and ran up the stairs through the cordon which at the time time still had a few gaps. Though I was pushed by the riot policeman who chased me just as I got through. I thought this was really unnecessary and  a unacceptable use of force.

Yesterday on my day off I took a ride to Stratford (beautiful town) and was behind one of the HPI idiots on some twistes. I boomed past a bunch of cars on a nice straight an this knob jockey overtook me while I was overtaking them....I was doing around 85-90mph to make the overtake quick and safe so I got no clue how fast he was going...

So I pull in slow back down a bit and think nothing more.

5minutes Later I see the colour coded leather wearing fool ahead ,cornering around the inside of all corners (correct position please?) and generally going bitch ass slow. So I go around the outside of him admittedly around 10 over the speed limit and happily cruise off in to the distance

I am by no means the next Rossi, but I know a good line through a corner and how coming in wide gives you a better view. This idiot wasn't even using any sort of line, and was tightening up in the corners (I'm down over the tank for handling and weight shifting, he is bolt upright arms tight trying to lean)

It's straight line heroes like him that give riders a bad name. They are more often those that are involved in crashes from poor position or observations, and ride far beyond their skill levels (not the bike, well lets be honest all our bikes are better than we will ever be)

I hope he realises soon that some refresher lessons would be helpful....or maybe an advanced session or 2 ಠ_ಠ",0,1373370467,null,0,false,0,cayvp8h,t3_1hwy58,t1_cayvp8h,t1_cayv31n,null,1430533003,4,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4

This line always irritates me. How is Lukaku/Torres/Ba not comparable to a mid level club striker? It is understandable to want a world class striker up top, but current situation is such that we cannot get one so easily. Once we offload torres, it will be easier for us to get someone else. But, current situation (with the homegrown quota, and wage budget) demands us to play with our current option. 

Also, given the signings and Mourinho's play style, I am pretty sure, we will be playing 4-3-3 this year. So, switching to false - 9 when needed, will be pretty easy for us. In that case, we will be able to get more out of Hazard/Mata/Schurrle combo, than we can get out of a top striker. 

As for domination, we are few years away from that. We need our young guys to come up to world class levels, to get there. let's just can that idea of domination, while we build a much better foundation this time.

I'd have thought they quite like the current situation.

If RM has to keep the universal service obligation that will put them at an immediate disadvantage anyway (like they have now).

I'm not even sure if it would change the situation for domestic post.

It really isn't ""new"", but you can only say that 'Suarez wants to leave but won't turn in a transfer request' in so many ways, and that has been the narrative for quite a while i agree. But it is reporting that we met with his agent in person and the issue of Suarez and his desire for a move was brought up (of course we have been in contact, but a face-to-face meeting is usually more than just catching up and staying in touch). Just because there are no direct quotes, does not mean it is any less relevant or does not add validity to the fact that Suarez wants to go.  It is continued reporting that verifies earlier reports and brings us new information about direct talks between Liverpool management and Suarez's agent just before he is scheduled to return to the club (that is good, continued journalism, not just rehashing). 

&gt;Also the echo hasn't been classed as a good LFC Source since H&amp;G left the club a few years ago.

If you insulate a box, you slow down the movement of heat. Whether the heat is moving into the box or out of the box, it is slowed down. A well insulated house will retain a more steady temperature during the year, so it will not get so cold (so fast) in the winter, nor so hot (so fast) in the summer.

The fact that the story tells us that THREE people have signed up to Green Deal, and the professor is telling us that it will cause 4000 deaths by 2080 (up from 2000 - or is he actually saying our population will have doubled by 2080?) makes this a silly non-story IMO.

The [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2358191/OAPs-die-Green-Deal-homes-Energy-saving-scheme-leave-homes-dangerously-overheated.html) goes all-out on this story, including a picture of a worried pensioner. The Daily Mail ends on this statement from DECC, which the BBC leaves out:

&gt; If energy efficiency measures are installed appropriately, overheating should not be a common problem and there’s guidance available for those involved in the Green Deal.’

The story has gained legs in every UK news outlet on the word of this professor. I'll say it now: Prof Chris Goodier - you are talking shit.

However, looking at the types of papers he writes, he tends to present alternative futures for what *may* happen in the future in order to bring such subjects to the forefront to discuss and consider strategically. So my guess is that one side of an argument was pulled from one of his papers to serve as some ""news"".

They don't play in a similar way at all and having one instead of the other is a huge change in the desired tactial application of our attack.  Eriksen doesn't play as direct direct or with the same kind of pace/power, he doesn't make the same defensive contribution or have the dynamism/utility in his play to do so, and he doesn't have the same kind of movement and finishing instincts in the final third.  What does do very well is control the flow of the game and pull the strings to orchestrate the attack.  He crafts the attack, whereas Mkhitaryan really drives it on and finishes it off.  Ironically they'd compliment each other very well if they were in the same lineup together IMO, but one does not straight swap or replace the other as there are significant differences in the way both of them play the game.  Mkhitaryan is a unique sort of player that really reminds me of Steven Gerrard (in his mid/late 20s) in the way he attacks and I think that's what really drew us to him.

I'm not saying Eriksen is a bad player by any means.  He's really good at what he does.  He just doesn't do what Mkhitaryan does.  He's like a more control oriented Coutinho or Sneijder, whereas Micky is like if Gerrard and Lampard had a baby 5-6 years ago (when they were both playing in more attacking roles and had the legs + freedom to move about more).

true,socialcrap,null,null,"&gt;We are not gravely restricted by those rules. We can easily get another, especially after offloading many players such as Malouda etc. The fact that Torres, Lukaku and Ba are merely good enough for mid level club is the main problem. We do not have any strikers that can lead us against top tier.

Few days ago, I had similar conversation about FFP and HomeGrown quota. I am not an expert on this, but IIRC, we don't have enough slots left. We have already signed Schurrle for Malouda, so that spot is as it is. Plus, we have a lot of young players to start breaking them in. So, we are kind of restricted. As for mid level club point, well there aren't many strikers in the market. As it stands, we have only Rooney left who is proven to be better than our trio, and has been playing at highest level. No one else is good enough, and all of them are at same level as Demba Ba. Remember 10goals in half season? Ba was doing as good as most strikers in PL. We clearly do not need another one like him. 



&gt;We can not always play false number every game. And as for youth players, yes they are good and it will take a couple of years for them to get a solid foundation in starting 11. We cannot, however, rely on them to be our main team. We need a few experienced and world class players to fill the void. If the youth surgence had come in a few years back when people like drogba, lampard and terry will still around with major role in team, it would have been an ideal situation. Experience and strike force on the pitch, while translating all this experience to the youth breaking through our team. We do not have much of that anymore. Lampard is probably looking at a relaxed deep role now due to his age, he can not run box box. Oscar, hazard, luiz, cahill are still developing their game. Mata can probably be counted as one who can lead and teach but that is not enough either in my opinion.

I know we missed our mark of creating a foundation. AVB was at perfect time to start that, but short-term results and oversight made us lose 2years of transition period. We are playing catch-up with ageing squad since then, but we can't help it. Buying someone new will not get us the experience we need. We need players with Chelsea mentality, to bake that in every young player's mind. Can we do that with some player from other club? Can rooney or ibra teach that to lukaku? 

&gt;We desperately need a good signing. I am not saying we need a major 50 million cavani signing. Rather a 23-25 year old striker who can bring much more firepower than Ba, especially at CL level. Three strikers is a good number of strikers if rotated well. You can not expect one or two strikers to lead the game every week after week. With CL, FA and intl duty, we need at least 3 strikers who can be fit and relaxed for every upcoming game. 

Actually, I am not against buying one more striker for depth. But, buying another young prospect will kill chances for lukaku. Buying an okay striker will again be good for depth, but cause the same problem that we had with Ba. Also, having 2strikers at full health for every game is good enough. Our new formation will be 4-3-3 for sure considering our latest signings. In that scenario, 2strikers are good for now. But, if Roman loosens his purse strings a bit more, sure it will be for better. 


&gt;I would not mind someone like el shaarawy to take over from Ba. He has proven himself at top tier football. Provide enough backup to Torres. Lukaku come in with rotation, taking on the mid level while occasionally subbing in for top teams. If over time, he proves to be better than el shaarawy, he can take a bigger role. No one is to be guaranteed a place in starting 11. You have to fight for your position. 

Again, same problem as Ba. We need a marquee player to replace torres instead of someone to replace Ba. Sure, Ba was unable to work with our system, but he is pretty good. We can't be sure if next one will be better than him, at all. 



Now, what I see happening is, that Torres/Lukaku will be rotating next season with Hazard,Mata and Schurrle on wings. Moses will be rotated in during mid-week games. Our midfield is jam-packed, and moving Hazard to wider role will definitely be on the cards here. Oscar/Lamps/Essien/KDB/Rami/Mikel/Ginkel will be dropped to second line. We both know, our bigger problem this season was conceding silly goals, not creating chances. Let us just remedy that first, then worry about depth. 

Based on Jose's interview this season, we can be sure that long term development is on the plans. Going in to the market for short-term future will probably not be a good idea. Ofcourse, this all changes if we land some top lad in late 20s, but again only rooney is available in the market. I am not sure, even Jose would be interested to break the bank for someone like him though.

We are interested in returning back (to my) home at some point in the future, but frankly I have no fucking sympathy at all with the whinging entitled bastards who expect some kind of red carpet treatment as soon as they decide they've had enough of the place they left Britain for in the first place.

My wife is a nurse.  So is her sister who is also Japanese and unmarried.

In the case of *one* family it doesn't sound so bad. But added up, I do question how 'open' the doors should be before we have to re-question and test someone's commitment to returning. 

In the case of the author of the article for instance - he was presumably happy to move to Australia and I don't begrudge him that choice - but he does sound highly entitled over his right to return and how the burden of his wife's career choice is somehow the problem of the British government / public, rather than *her* problem...

...and perhaps that's the main point here? That people are free to choose to leave the country if they find there's value in doing so - but it's their decision and their *problem* if returning and being supported as they do so isn't made as simple as getting on a plane.

You can count on one hand the number of players in the world that can do what he can, and none of them would join a club that isn't currently playing in the Champions League.

But put it this way.  Say you sell Suarez for £40m, Reina for £8m, Skrtel for £7m, and Coates for £3m.  Then, hypothetically of course, you go buy Benteke for £24m, Papadopoulos for £18m, Eriksen for £12m (I know, I know), Alderweireld for £6m, and a backup left back for £3-4m.  I don't think any of those prices are unreasonable for either party, the net spend there is only around £5m and the team becomes a hell of a lot deeper.  That hypothetical new team I laid out has a much better chance of qualifying for the top 4 rather than the Suarez/Reina/Skrtel/Coates bunch.  You nail down a CL spot, THEN start aiming for world class players.

I've already made the video. Millions have seen it. It provoked this Public consultation.

reasonable grounds = Reasonable cause = reasonable suspicion

Semantics it's all the same thing. 

Detention can only come from

1) for contempt of court
2) People suffering from mental disorders in a public place and in immediate need of care or control 
3) people who have absconded from detention 
4) for non-payment of a fine 	
5) to determine whether a football banning order should be made 

Everything else is an arrest. 

Stop and Search and detain are not the same thing. For stop and search you MUST have grounds. Grounds would need to lead to an arrest. If you don't get an arrest from a stop and search you did not have the correct grounds. 

If searched with out arrest they can sue the police for the search and assault. They would win. They would settle out of court.

Most people don't know their rights they just do as the police ask. In cities cops abuse stop and search and stop and request more because they don't get to use the transportation laws to get info like outside of the city.  

If I'm wrong this info is coming from the police rep who is consulting on this issue at the top levels of the government is wrong. Which would be pretty fucked up.

Seven years later they made a TV movie/backdoor pilot for a new series with a new (eighth) Doctor, but it was not well-received and nothing came of it.   Nine years after that they launched the new series that is still running, with yet another new Doctor - Christopher Eccleston, the ninth to bear the name.

&gt; I think your purposely trying to skew reality to bash UKIP.

If I could alter reality, UKIP would be on my list, sure, but not near the top of things to change.

&gt; BBC failed to investigate Savvile and the rest, even though their was many reports. They have a responsibility for internal investigations so does UKIP.

No, I think you'll find if you check that Savile was investigated several times. Both by the police and the BBC. However, I've no real interest in debating that right now, and suggest you start at his wikipedia page if you want to look into these. 

The main difference between that and this is that what the BBC had were mostly rumours, not direct allegations. But I'll say it again, any internal investigation that finds a direct allegation of a crime should report this to the police. If it wants to look at how to avoid things happening again, sure, that's relevant and useful too, but not in terms of how to discredit alleged victims.

&gt; Your understanding of internal bureaucracy in organisation is simply lacking. 

May I refer you to the upvotes the boilerplate statement I drafted above has received.

I do that sort of thing professionally, actually, including in the past for local government and large companies. I even once had the pleasure of Nigel Farage phoning me up to complain over a fairly petty point in something I'd written. He also demanded I write a feature on him, despite him not actually being relevant to what I was working on at the time. I didn't quite tell him to where to go there and then, but explained to him exactly why he was wrong and had the full backing of my manager when doing so, because I'd followed the guidelines of that organisation. Farage disagreed, but it was eff all to do with him anyway and he was told so and that no matter how outraged he was, he could ~~fuck off~~ go through the proper channels to lodge a complaint if he wanted, instead of harassing a member of staff directly, and no he wasn't going to get a puff-piece because despite being an MEP, he wasn't one for the area covered, or anything relevant to that level of government.

I know both how bureaucracy should work, and how it does work in practice. And, yeah, I've also dealt with reputation management issues when someone in a company has severely fucked up and had to be disciplined, whilst still maintaining the company's reputation. That wasn't a criminal issue though, but the right thing needed doing whilst both admitting fault and avoiding litigation or prejudicing any potential civil cases, which can be a very fine line to tread. So I've seen it from both sides.

&gt; If you report to the police their going to want to know what you have found, if its ""nothing"" then they get in the car and walk away. They want organisations to investigate and provide them information and leads.

Bullshit, and for very good reasons. They'll want to know what information there is, sure, but they certainly won't accept any conclusions made by said organisations. If they suspect that anything is being hidden from them, then if they're doing their jobs properly, will see that as a crime in itself.

I'm not that fond of bar stools unless it's a seat in a row of interesting or entertaining individuals, and I don't like benches which are too thin.

I really think that the placement of the furniture has a greater effect on overall comfort than the material does. A chair which partially blocks the main thoroughfare is a liability, as the person sitting in it will need to keep shuffling (or just leaning forwards as a token gesture while the gap remains unchanged).

Couches are something I haven't fully got to grips with. I think it must depend wholly on the setting, both within the pub and of the pub itself - a black leather sectional sofa is just not proper, while a Chesterfield is over-the-top in all but the most sprawling of country pubs.

Thinking about it, I agree with you about bar stools. They're uncomfortable, unstable and inconvenient. They also make chatting quite difficult as they demand you swivel to face one direction at a time.

Coutinho is basically our man for that role now and I'd hate to see him usurped at this point (I was ok with him moving to a wider position to make room for Micky because of the different dynamic) and we seem to want a more dominant/powerful presence out of our attacking midfielder if the pursuit of Micky is anything to go by.  The two of them can probably play together and it would be pretty nice to see the incredible passing coming from our attackers if they're in the same side.  Suarez better stay at that point as he'll be in football heaven with our ability to play him in and pick out his clever movement.  I'm definitely interested in seeing the direction we end up taking!

I was more comparing Micky's attacking play to a younger Gerrard.  I think Stevie was a far more versatile player in his prime, just that the attacking styles are similar.  Micky makes such powerful runs forward from deeper positions and can hit a shot, he's bagged plenty of nice goals from 20-25 yards out.  He seems to have that extra bit of awareness and positioning that Lampard has done so well too, being in the right place at the right time.

True, but the inaction that has lead to it isn't.

People don't want coal, its yuckie, they don't want nuclear because they are too thick to know the difference between fission and fusion doesn't mean they can't chant *no more Chernobyl* or something.

Meanwhile, we've got these Windfarms, which cost a fortune, generate sporadic supply (I find that webpage I posted strangely soothing, its like watching the world tick by) so we need more power storage.  As I've said before flooding most of wales for energy storage would be funny, but I don't think it's practical.  So how do we tackle our base load?

Well sadly, I think I know what the answer will be.  Semen's can pretty much rock up with a ready built gas type, and it turns out we're into fracking.  It's relatively clean, and not too disruptive.  However it's scaling costs are poor.

I was lucky enough to have a ride in a Tesla.... Well they have a few bugs to work out, but hell that is the future.  It's actually fun.  Really good fun to drive.  It's also super cheap compared to diesel.

Now I and everyone else who will be driving these in 15 years, will not mind slowly charging overnight on economy 7 or similar, but wind isn't going to help, neither is photovoltaic or most other kinds of solar.  (I read a paper once on a combined solar / geothermal storage thing, but doubt anyone can do it economically).  If we had a good nuclear setup, the costs decrease in-line with scaling up.  However gas just won't do that.  Gas has the advantage of fast spooling up and down, but if we have a more increased demand for overnight use, this won't help long term.

That is why I'm saddend by our plans, why I think the immediate reaction to go to gas will be very short term, and environmentally unfriendly long term.

&gt;removes the power from the hands of the few, people who have all the fuel, or people who have massive power plants who game the energy markets driving up prices

Have you compared our wholesale costs to that of the EU?  It's not bad, the problem is simply that costs have gone up.  I find it funny people blame privatisation for jumps in wholesale costs, that are often below the standard prices of Gas/Coal/Oil.  Meanwhile convientally ignoring the cost of the *green* subsidies.

A lot of students live in Marchmont which gives you a lot of space for a decent rent. Personally, I've liked living in the centre of Old Town around well known roads like Forrest Road and South Bridge. You're right in the  centre between uni and the nice bars and shops in New Town.

There's loads of cheap nights out that are always being advertised. My favourite bars are in New Town, specifically on the streets around George Street, however it can get a bit pricey (drinks are still cheaper than they would be in London, though) and the people can be a bit too much to take at times. A lot of students and young people like to hang out around the Cowgate and the Grassmarket. It'll usually be around £2-3 for a pint I believe.

Some of my favourite go to places for a cheap drink around uni are **Bar Kohl** (you get food for 50% off with a Snapfax card - they give them away in the street) and **Brass Monkey** which I love because it's cosy and cool. They've got really cheap drinks and they've also got little games like chess and stuff for you to be social.

But, I don't like 11.

11 for me is that child at school that tries so desperately to be different and 'random' that whenever you see him you pull out the ticklist of 'Random' things he's going to do today.

He also embodies the Americanized elements of the show more than any other character (and, no offense to American viewers, but I much preferred it when RTD was running just because he targeted us Brit's alone, now the show is trying to 'diversify' it's lost it's charm). 

Americanized elements you say. Whatever are they? Well the big one that is my biggest gripe is the continual catchphrase dropping and quirky gags.

But Nine and Ten also had catchphrases and quirky gags? Why aren't you mad at them?

Okay. Nine had 'Fantastic' and that one funny bit with the banana. 

Ten had 'Brilliant' (I suppose you could also argue Allons-y, but that's far more of a fan decided catchphrase as it was only said about 4 times over his run) and the 3D glasses, which were only used in one episode and never referred to again (Again, fan blowing out of proportion).

Eleven had: Geronimo which is dropped every other episode throughout his run. He also has the god damn stupid I wear &lt;X&gt; now, &lt;X&gt; is cool which never ever serves the plot. Yeah.

Although I don't blame Matt Smith for this the writing and characterization across his era on the show has been atrocious, the best example is Amy, between her arrival and departure she: Searched for a man for 12 years, found him, decided she didn't actually want him, went off with somebody else, watched that person get killed multiple times, had that person shoot her, married him, had a baby, lost the baby, discovered the baby after growing up went on to marry her childhood lover, discovered she was infertile, divorced the man and then remarried him.

We are TOLD all of this, yet in Eleventh Hour and Angels In Manhattan she is written exactly the same.

The same is true of 11, despite rebooting the universe twice and loosing people.etc .etc he's still the exact same character for the most part, certainly hasn't changed as much as 9 or 10 did over their eras.

RM isn't that great.  It's often cheaper to send things via courier, hell look at your utility bill and see if there is a TNT stamp on the back.

The 19 year old CL experienced striker playing for Ajax. He scored 10 goals and 5 assists in 20 appearances this year. Problem is he has 4 years left on his contract.

&gt;Osvaldo 

Roma striker, had a massive fight with the manager recently so will almost certainly want out. Do we want another striker with an attitude problem? I'm not so sure. Currently plays for Roma, netted 16 times with 2 assists in 29 matches and available for under £15m - he has been consistent goal scorer for years.

&gt;Wissam Ben Yedder

Young, cheap and got 15 goals / 5 assists in 34 matches for a poor Toulouse side. He wouldn't be good enough to lead the line yet, but great one off the bench with an eye to the future.

&gt;Ljajic

From Fiorentina and could be poached as they now have both Jovetic and Gomez. He is coming off a very strong season with 11 goals and 6 assists in 28 appearances. He can also play LW and is only 21. Drawback is that last season is the only good one he has had. Contract ends in 1 year tho.

&gt;Yilmaz

This time last year he was a Bony or a PAE, a risky venture as he had impressed in poor leagues. This year he netted 8 goals in 9 CL apps and 24 goals (+8 assists) in 30 Turkish league matches. Unfortunately I don't know how gettable he is, but certainly one to watch.


&gt;Juve

This whole squad, I saw someone mention this on another forum. They just brought Tevez + Llorrente and so the current striker force is probably up for sale. I have a feeling a Juve rejects could do the job here. 


Have to be careful shopping from both France and Netherlands as prolific scorers have come from there and flopped.

2. If you're sending people for a nice cushy course of therapy, you are incentivising crime. I have no doubt that people would deliberately commit and confess to violent crimes if they thought they were getting a 2-week holiday at the cost of the state.

OFCOM is not responsible for censorship in telecoms services, as I understand it. Not even Cleanfeed is a mandatory program to participate in.

They might be prudish when it comes to TV but the comment explicitly stated telecoms.

&gt; In my opinion, Ofcom has been extremely slow when it comes to pushing new technologies that would be of great benefit to everyone (businesses and individuals) - like broadband in rural areas, 4G, etc. Europe and North America are far ahead of us when it comes to such technologies.

That isn't OFCOM's fault (or at least not totally theirs). Years of bickering and legal threats between our lovely mobile network operators was what caused the delay. It was only when EE was about to launch their LTE service on existing spectrum that a deal was agreed and the auction was allowed to proceed (and then it did).

&gt; Also, the price of texting I think is a problem in every country. Sending 160 letters over a network should cost a fraction of a penny. 

Says who? I'm not sure there are that many paying 10p/message any more. All of the networks give you bucketloads of text messages just for topping up.

The cost to deliver the service (and it's not free like some people thingk doesn't have to have any bearing on what the company can sell it for.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"There's a wealth of literature on false confessions.  A psychologist called [Gísli Guðjónsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%ADsli_Gu%C3%B0j%C3%B3nsson) is one of the foremost experts on the topic.  He types at least three basic categories of false confession which arise in different scenarios and affect different personalities:

""  


1.  Voluntary false confessions occur without any obvious pressure from the police. They are internally generated. Often these people go to the police after a crime has been reported in the media and make a confession. This type of false confession arises from many different causes, the best known being a morbid desire for notoriety. The person is unable to distinguish fact from fantasy; they need to expiate guilt feelings through receiving punishment and a desire to protect somebody else from interrogation and prosecution.  



2.  Coerced-compliant false confessions are elicited in a situation where the person perceives that there is some immediate instrumental gain from confessing falsely. Examples include escaping from a highly stressful situation, such as from police interrogation or confinement. The person is fully aware of not having committed the crime of which he or she is accused. Typically this form of false confession is retracted once the immediate threat is over, but this is not always the case.  



3.  Coerced-internalized confessions: of the three types of false confession, coerced-internalized false confessions are psychologically the most sophisticated because they involve a change in the suspect's own belief system about what is supposed to have happened at the time of the alleged crime. Like the compliant type, these false confessions are typically elicited by persuasive questioning, but here the techniques used to elicit the false confession are usually more subtle and involve trust in the interrogator and the scenario suggested. Suspects are gradually persuaded that they have committed a crime of which they have no memory recollection, or suspects have become so confused that they no longer trust their own memory and unwittingly accept the false scenario. The techniques recommended in American interrogation manuals attempt to undermine suspects' confidence in their own recollections and alter their perceptions of the situation.

Base load for the foreseeable future will have to be tackled from large dispatch-able generators, such as nuclear or gas. Agreed. However if we increase the elasticity of loads to move when generation is available then we can manipulate the base load around available generation. 

&gt;Now I and everyone else who will be driving these in 15 years, will not mind slowly charging overnight on economy 7 or similar, but wind isn't going to help, neither is photovoltaic or most other kinds of solar.

Wind blows at night, charges up yours and everyone else's car, drive to work, sits in a car park all day, solar charges it up. So yes, it is categorically going to help.

&gt;Have you compared our wholesale costs to that of the EU?

Yes. Like any market reliant on supply and demand costs alter around this. If we continue to lean on big market players when the supply drops, which it will, or security of supply is under threat, which is will be. Up goes the costs. If we have a diversified distributed energy supply to fall back on then the problem is not so bad. 

These green subsidies are ensuring we begin this diversification. Progress in power electronics and distributed energy storage and the advanced control systems to manage all this IS catching up to remove the intermittent problems associated with present renewable energy sources.

Now yesterday it was pretty damn windy, or at least it felt that way cycling up round Allypally.  Yet even with the new London Array online, we got sod all from the wind.  Meanwhile it was really sunny.  I got a text from an old co-worker that it was so hot they had all gone down to the pub, the AC couldn't keep the temp down, and the servers had generated so much heat it was above H&amp;S limits.

Meanwhile, look at what the wind generators managed!  Almost but not quite 30% of its peak.  Hmm.

Look at what they managed today.

The thing with Germany is its bollocks, they are buying their energy from France, they do have a lot of micro generation, such as photovoltaic panels.

But those have to be heavily subsidised to make economic sense.  The £12k I spent on them will only be worthwhile because of the Feed In Tarrif which is immoral, as I'm profiting because I had £12k spare, from every energy user.  It's very *unprogressive* form of taxation.

It would be better value to build lots of nuclear!  This would give a much more stable power generation in terms of base load, and as everyone starts to get in to electric cars, it would make transport much cheaper.

It's the reactors that cost.  The spent fuel is so small in terms of space, we could easily just create a dump area that won't trouble us for thousands of years by which time it will be safe.

The cost of such solar power is more than Nuclear fission!

There's a good chance, that for that time, she had a job, and thus would have been paying taxes. Additionally, if they are going to be living in Britain, her training will be paid for, but then she will be working in Britain - isn't that kinda the point of these programs? To train people so they have people doing those jobs.

However, the main complaint, which you manage to completely look over - he is in Australia, and works as a freelancer, so he has no fixed income, thus they can't even apply for the visa. Having to come to Britain alone to find a job, which who knows how long could take - in the mean while having to pay living costs for living there, and additionally still paying for the rest of your family back home will make things more difficult. That bit, to me is completely retarded. Regardless of his personal situation, it is fucking stupid. 

Additionally, the minimum salary requirement seems to be a country wide one, you could live up north, not amazingly, but still easily comfortable enough that you would still have some disposable income after bills and food, for much less than that minimum. The article also stated that it was a requirement for the British national to meet that alone - so two people at anything under that wouldn't be acceptable, which again, is pretty fucking retarded.

The whole thing seems, not to make it hard for sham marriages to get into the UK, but just generally to fuck people over because it's funny to do that, there's no other reasonable explanation. If you want to stop sham marriages, then do something to stop that, all this does is bone many legitimate Brits. I mean, I don't know much about sham marriages, but surely they're getting paid a lot, for doing that, would it be so far out of believability that they might set up a fake company or whatever to be able to claim they are earning over the minimum, if they don't actually have a legitimate form of employment?

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"So Kevin MacDonald is the manager of Swindon, someone who was rumoured to be a target for Spurs youth manager when Liverpool poached ours. He opted to move to Swindon, but it shows that THFC clearly rate him as a developer of youth.

So, it seems that spurs would try very hard to loan to Swindon as they rate the manager. Also, to help the players fit in (and to simplify monitoring) it would also be nice to loan them as many players as possible. Of course, that is our perfect world, they probably won't want to develop all our youth players only to send them back, what is in it for them?

Well, WindyCOYS postulated this some time ago:

&gt;[Players] being tied down to a season-long loan means that he can’t be recalled and sent to a Championship club in January should he naturally progress, due to FA rules. This has lead to talk of a sneaky work-around. Could Spurs have actually sold the players – i.e. transferred their registration – with a buy-back clause of £1? I guess we will find out in [last] January.

So, rumour was that Spurs and Swindon set up an unofficial partnership. We loan them (and sell them with £1 buyback clauses) a large number of players - getting around the 4 player max rules. We are even nice enough to loan them players who could be playing at a much higher level to help them get promoted and in return they develop our youth. Essentially Swindon becomes ""Spurs B in the Championship"". They get promoted, we get developed youth.

Now, someone like Luongo or Pritchard could EASILY land a championship (or higher) loan, and now we see them off to Swindon. Sounds like we are scratching their back here. If they get promoted, could they return the favour?

In the last 6 months we have seen Parrett and Byrne join full time as well as Hall on loan. Now Pritchard/Luongo (well above 3rd div level) are on the way too and the original rumours say that Mason (who was loaned to Ligue 1 in France last season!) is on the way too, oh, and Swindon have officially targetted Ceballos.

By my count that is 5 players confirmed moved to Swindon, 2 of those could be punching far higher. Conspiracy predicts that in a shock move someone like Mason or Ceballos will also end up at Swindon, which will give them a serious side to go for a promotion tilt.

EDIT: 2.5 weeks later Mason joins.

Since there aren't currently very good ways to store energy from renewable sources when it is in abundance so that we can fall back on it when it is not, then removing too much capacity in terms of regular generation is foolish.

I'll elaborate about the storage problem; currently probably the best way is to pump water up a hill into a reservoir when there's lots of wind/solar energy being generated so it can used to generate hydroelectric when it's particularly cloudy, or a still day (or if demand spikes for some reason) but since that isn't possible (or even practical) everywhere, we need more ""traditional"" power plants. Ideally we invent a much more efficient battery for at least solar power, and best case, for wind turbines as well, because at present, storing solar power in a battery is pretty inefficient.

true,cakeshop,null,null,"&gt;It will be gas. You can sort of spin them up and down with small lag time. But if you've nuclear there is no point spinning it down. Because the fuel cost is so tiny. It's the reactors that cost.

Okay this is a misconception a turbine will 'spin' a rotor at synchronous speed which is 50Hz, so nothing spins up or down, all that is occurring is that more or less energy is needed to maintain this speed and that is determined by the load connected to it. A gas turbine can react faster to achieve this as you can burn more or less at a moments notice.

You don't do it with nuclear because the energy comes from a fission reaction which is far harder to control on a whim. Anyway.

&gt;Really?! 4kw panels. That is the most common people have in the UK on their roof. How much do those things weigh? A shitlot.

I will agree that is not a lot but when grouped with say a local area penetration of 1000 more homes that is a 4MW installation, which can provide significant amount of the energy being used in the area. Or at least balancing services to the Distribution Network Operator.


&gt;A Tesla S has a 60kwh battery. That means it would have to be sunny all day, at 100% efficiency for the panels (doesn't ever happen in Cornwall, best we've logged is about 70%) for 15 hours to charge it. That is before anything else will come along.

Another misconception. Are you going to use all the energy in the car up every time you use it? No, so really all you'll normally need is a top up. So your 15 hours plummets to something more reasonable like 2-3 (including cloud cover and other losses) hours for an average journey of 1 hour.

I totally agree with you on the fast breeders nuclear energy. Using a thorium generator seems way more sensible. However as I've stated previously it is difficult to control any fission reactors output due to that nature of how fission reactor work, you can't switch it off an on at a whim. So at best you could use a thorium reactor to provide most the base load but will still need fast acting dispatchable energy to balance the system around the load point in order to maintain the security and stability of the network.

Suarez has made him and he family an easy target for journalists, yes, but also random twats on the street or in the mall. They can never go visit other parts of England because the hostility would probably just be even greater. Its probably difficult for his family to ever really leave the house in fear that some random people will heckle them with no other motives but to make them feel bad ro embarassed. I know he's a celebrity and can only expect a little bit of privacy, but i doubt he has any in England anymore.

I think a move would be best for him and his family. The country he currently resides in is now hostile towards him, and has become unlivable. 

If the right offer comes in, we need to sell for Suarez's good if anyone on the board of directors actually cares about his wife or little girl.

We are all focused an concerned on how it will effect the club and if we'll get the right price, which makes sense considering we're football fans first and foremost, but is that really first a foremost? Or are we all human beings, firs and foremost, who should care about the well being of our beloved clubs valued players and his family? Imagine you just moved to a foreign country where your husbands job is the most cherished job in that country? And now, your husband shamed his name a bit, resulting in animosity and hostility form the people of that foreign country.

true,Apwnalypse,null,null,"My personal prediction is that house prices and rents will go on rising for decades at least, until there is a fundamental change in policy and attitude.

I think fundamentally we have to question some parts of our home owning culture. The idea that everyone should want to be on the house market is based on the assumption that the value of housing will generally rise faster than inflation / wages: otherwise investing money in housing is less profitable than putting that money in a bank account or shares.

But let's think about what that means: say property prices go up by 10% above inflation. If I own a £100,000 house, I make £10,000 and I pat myself on the back. But someone who owns a buy to let empire of £1m, makes £100,000 and the sheikh who own £10m of flats in london makes a million. The problem with building an economy around housing instead of jobs is that one person can only work one job, but can own lots of property. And in fact, if I don't own any property, rising property prices make me poorer because all that extra wealth drives up the cost of living.

And isn't it basically so undeniable as to be tautology, that when property prices rise faster than inflation or wages, the haves get richer in comparison to the have nots? Even those of us who own houses, need to stop seeing rising house prices as good news, because rising house prices are one of the biggest drivers of inequality.

The fact is that the market has failed. A properly functioning market increases supply to meet increasing demand, but the housing market does the opposite. Once again we are asking the state to pick up the pieces for the failure of the private sector, and going to the government and demanding they build more affordable housing. But how can we seriously expect the ruling class of this country (who own most of the land and property) to support a mass house building programme, when such a programme would cause the value of their assets to fall?

What is needed instead is to change the fundamental economic conditions governing land and property. Despite soaring rents and house prices, we all every day, walk past abandoned homes in great locations, abandoned petrol forecourts that never get developed, great brownfield sites that go underdeveloped because they are owned by supermarkets and landbanks who never develop them because they just want to stop a rival from making use of them, or because they would rather have a piece of land as asset making them money, than make a large payoff for developing it and selling it off.

All these things happen because fundamentally, land costs nothing to keep once you own it outright, and without ongoing costs, there is no opportunity cost to wasting land.

That's what needs to be changed: we need to shift the burden of taxation away from wages and onto property ownership. The mansion tax and 10p tax rate is a great start by milliband, but we need to do more. We should allow councils to charge higher rates of council tax to vacant properties and undeveloped land. Suddenly their owners will find themselves running at a loss and be forced to either make use of them or sell them on to those that will.

But we need to go further. We should extend these policies into a national Land Value Tax on all land and properties, and use the proceeds to fund cuts to VAT and more importantly, an end to all income taxation for those on the minimum wage. These policies will restore demand to the economy, build more houses, and lower rents in the long term. Not only do I believe that these measures will fix the British economy, I believe that there will be no long term recovery until they are implemented.

true,Gaitskells_Ghost,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"There's a bit of a myth about the efficiencies of the nationalised rail network to be honest. I'm going to paraphrase/steal this from a colleague, but this is pretty much as close as you'll get to an expert view within the sector - he basically argues that nationalisation would be an operational disaster, hugely expensive, and completely impractical to achieve, as well as possibly illegal under European law. 

The only way to achieve nationalisation in real terms to be the secession of franchise arrangements to the TOC. Now, legality aside for a moment, genuine is likely to take at least a decade. Some of the lines could be run as concession, (That's how London Overground currently is and how Scotrail is becoming) yet one still has private companies running the thing, and it's much more expensive for the taxpayer. 

As with many things in this sector, our main issue is the absolutely useless nature of the Department for Transport. Given the cock-up that was seen with the WCML procurement exercise - which, it should be noted, ended up costing the industry and the taxpayer several million quid - I fail to see how they could run every train line and all the rolling stock effectively. The crisis with the Intercity Express Programme is an obvious example, given that they insist on developing a train that no one wants to use when we could just buy direct from the manufacturer.

The other problem, and the main source of waste in the industry, is the one bit which is publically-owned; Network Rail. Ever wonder why the roofs of stations are often so disgusting, and the bits that are newly-painted stop at head height? It's because the operators aren't allowed to do any maintenance above that level. Basically - you could solve the issue by breaking up NR into regional franchises, or give the current rail franchise owners total responsibility from everything from the lines to the stations. 

Look, we have phenomenal rail network in this country. No one in the industry (or DafT for that matter) wants the old system. Indeed - customer satisfaction and service levels are stratospheric compared with the old BR. We suffer from an issue in the this country of being the first to do things. We have issues with infrastructure suffers because we were the first country to build railways, we currently suffer from being the first to privatise, and this means that other countries have been able to learn from some of the mistakes that were made.

So, for me at least, I think that the primary issue with DafT is that it is a monolithic department staffed by career civil servants when they really should be appointing more qualified economists and systems analysts. There is a lot to be said for establishing regional models as a possible substitute for nationalisation, although I do think that the Concession model - London Overground writ large - has a lot to be said for local routes, although less so for intercity ones.

true,snupher,eccleston,Eccleston,"&gt;since the Doctor doesn't live in any form of linear timeline, how does he measure his age?

A simple atomic clock/calendar could solve that easily. Also, being born to rule time, he may have an internal clock or calendar or combo that is just instinctual. 

I do think you are getting closer to the issue that has bothered me every time he mentions his age, and that is; by what measurement is he using as a year? Since we know that a year is defined by how long it takes a celestial being to travel in an ellipse around a star, any body could have different year cycles. Generally speaking, one could assume that since most stories directly involve 2 species (timelords and humans) their homeworlds would be the most obvious locations to gather the measurement used for a year.
Now, barring the implausible idea that Gallifrey and Earth are exactly identical in distance from their stars, on the same orbital pattern, and traveling at the same speed, we can guess that he is using one planet and not the other's year for his age.

1) If Gallifrey's year is longer than Earth's; we can assume that even though he is (in the last episode I saw that he gave his age) 908. This can lead to possible outcomes. Either 1A) he is judging off of Gallifrey's year and is older than we could blindly postulate, 1B) The 908 years is Earth based and he is, possibly, only 30 years old or some other smaller number. This could lead to a theory about how timelords live to some normal lifespan (say, 72 years) but seeing that Gallifrey has a longer year, it seems much longer.

2) If Earth's year is longer than Gallifrey; Either 2A) ""1B"" above would be reversed, or 2B) He is judging from Gallifrey years that are much shorter than Earth years. 
We see this already in our own solar system, the orbital year for Mercury is much shorter than Earth. 

3) I'm sure that there could be a ""universal timespan"" that could be the same across space, but the idea of how to judge it would probably require more thinking than I have done here.

This is due to a lack of maturity.

There is a logic to that but in a society that was intelligent and mature enough, everybody would be getting the holidays they need. Proper therapy would not be cushy, it would require growing up, taking responsibility for oneself and understanding that the role of decent human beings is to help each other instead of being vindictive cretins. 

&gt;In a case like this, the guy is a danger to those around him...

If the guy is caught and can't be persuaded to behave, there might be a need to remove him (I guess it's not obscene to assume it's a man???) from society.

I know. So?

Secondly, regardless of the fact that he has a different style then the aforementioned, you can really only play 2-3 of those players at the same time. There are 7 including Moses. 

Piazon most likely will be loaned next season, as I said, Moses right now is clearly better than him. The fact that he offers us something different means that while he's not better than de Bruyne,  he's arguably more useful.

&gt;Right now it's looking like it'd cost around 8, roughly. 

Are you an ITK? 

&gt;No reason for Moses to be at CFC, he deserves to be a regular starter and that isn't possible at Chelsea for him at the moment. 

Why? Why does he ""deserve"" to be a starter? I doubt he came here expecting to start and he hasn't said he's discontent at Chelsea,  furthermore he can play a huge role next season, as he did last season where he played more games than he had in any other season.

The accused, Nat Fraser, was originally convicted in 2003 with an original term of 25 years.

true,rp420,null,null,"Just finished uni in Canterbury but i'll share a little about a few.

The Cricketers:

Surprisingly appealing during the day, although have never seen it that busy.  Pretty nasty pub at night (especially at the weekends) but often let people in past 1am - so sometimes handy for when Westgate spoons closes.

The Old Buttermarket:

A favourite of mine.  Not exactly a student pub but very nice imports on tap. A favourite for me and the missus.  Ate there only once - very nice fillet steak.  Would recommend. I suspect they close relatively early (not being a student marketed pub). 

Casey's:

Again, never been during the day.  Often have lively live music which is refreshing.  Relatively cheap booze (probably just a little more expensive than spoons).  Met some friendly people there and the bar staff have always been pleasant enough.

Three Tuns:

Only discovered in my very last week of uni.  Got talking to some of the bar staff - they're apparently looking at marketing themselves to the next generation of students.  VERY cheap Tuesday deals (£1.75 for most drinks if i remember) but that has only just started from what I recall. 


Could probably write little bits about a few more but only just realised this wasn't a student guide so I doubt any of this information is useful for tourists or whatnot. 


Edit:


Club Chemistry:

Not a pub. Almost reasonably priced drinks on offer nights. Extortionate prices otherwise.  Often nutty locals on non-student nights too.   

Westgate Inn:

My regular until I left Canterbury.  Wide selection of the obvious drinks at a cheap price.  Curry night on Tuesdays, steak night on Thursdays and roasts on Sundays were always the cheapest option in town but not the most glorious food.  Bar staff all friendly although probably move on pretty quick (being students). ",0,1373397288,null,0,1373457406,0,caz4ug5,t3_1hxk6l,t1_caz4ug5,t3_1hxk6l,null,1430528544,2,false,canterbury,t5_2sbso,2

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Hmm, I see what you're saying about the vehicle metaphor, but I don't think it's correct. Over time the EU has become more powerful and it looks to be getting increasingly more powerful. But I think you're understating how much the UK government has changed over time. I mean, there was no devolution until about 20 years ago and now we're set on a course to have even more. In the future we'll probably have electoral reform, House of Lords reform, more positive human rights, progression of equality and these are just the ones I can say there certainly will be in the future. 

The only real difference with the EU's evolution and the UK's over the same time period is that the EU has a more obvious direction, simply because how the EU moves is very obvious (more member states, greater powers). The UK is definitely going places, it's just that it's a lot harder to see where it's going. If you look passed EU enlargement and collecting powers, there's very little you can say about the direction its going. And even then, we're talking about a time scale which is over half a century. 

Additionally, even if the UK is in park at the moment, there's no reason that it will always remain that way. The UK looked fairly stationary pre-1939 and then suddenly the welfare state was created. Or look at the start of Thatcher's period in office. There appeared to be fairly little direction and then suddenly economic neo-liberalism took hold and the UK had a very clear direction for the next ~20 years.

Bollocks. In England and Wales there is no such thing as a consensual search. Its either supported by legislation or it isn't.

Section 117 PACE allows the use of force for stop and search. There are other types of search with there own legislation surrounding them but section 1.

true,snupher,eccleston,Eccleston,"I would like to start out by saying that I have tried to watch the original series and found it dry and long winded (not that they were bad, just not something that could keep my attention). So, I do not consider myself a whovian. Also, I have only been watching the new series for 3 weeks and am 4 episodes from finishing season 6. After that, I will have to find some way to catch up on season 7 asap. Now, I said all of that to say this; I hope this doesn't seem naive, and if it does, please take it with a grain of salt.

To answer the question, I have grown to be okay with Matt Smith. I think Eccelston and Tenant did great jobs and have thoroughly enjoyed watching both of them carve out a character for themselves in a long line of fiction. Matt Smith was difficult to accept at first, but has since gained the swagger that was prominent in 9 and 10.

But why did I not like him at first? I think it is that the Doctor is defined by how he is introduced. 

9 - was introduced bringing Autons to justice, then tried to explain to Rose the wonders of the things he has/could/will see or experience. His run, seemed like it  was about trying to  show the wonders of time and space, but finding justice in the problems that brought him there. Almost like an introspective superhero.

10 - was introduced as someone who needed help but found enough strength to help others. As he went on through his run, this Doctor seemed to find that the power he had was hard to control, he needed someone or more than one person to bring him back to the humanity that he loved and admired so much. He was always searching for acceptance, for his past and with his friends.

11 - was introduced as someone who let a little girl down only to come back and feel defeated but bound by his duties. He spends his first series slouched over, and somewhat second guessing his actions. (10 did this a lot, but it seemed a bit more inquisitive than 11) This has let up and he has started to become more inquisitive, like in the ganger arc where he pretends to be the flesh while his doppleganger pretends to be him all to see if connections where based on familiarities or not. So far, it seems that 11 is repenting for something, whether it is leaving pond waiting or something bigger...

true,stumbling_coherently,1986,,"Ok Arguably Chelsea had a very lackluster Premier League performance, nothing outrageous outside of the first 4 months.  The champions league was dramatically far from the best and took many Europa League matches too close for comfort (not to disrespect any opposition side).  If you look at the players on the list:

Vidal and Pirlo had ridiculous seasons with Juve winning in Italy 

Iniesta and Messi took La Liga early on and never really let go and made good stride in the CL

Falcao, Bale, Ronaldo, RvP, and Cavani are obvious inclusions 

And Cardozo was one of the most critical players in a Benfica side who were 1 point off the portuguese Liga with only ONE LOSS all season, in as well in the finals of their domestic cup and Europa League not to mention he scored 17 goals from midfield.

Gotze, Lewy, and Gundogan were the best players for Dortmund who performed well in the CL and despite being were blown away by Bayern this Bundesliga season were still second 

Bayern very handedly won the Treble with only the CL appearing to be difficult so their stars are not surprisingly on there, (They lost only 1 game in the Bunesliga and tied 4 against nurnburg, gladbach and twice to Dortmund only losing to Leverkusen early in the season in October)

The only questionable inclusions for me are Xavi (great player but arguably had a so-so seaosn not worthy of note imo) Zlatan (though technically he still did win Ligue 1 with PSG) and Dzeko (theres no caveat he should not be on this list)

Though I agree Mata should be on included I dont have a problem with any Bayern player on there except maybe Ribery. Every player on the list had OUT-OF-THEIR minds seasons each with noticeably large contributions (most more than one) at crucial points of competitions. It is what it is.  I personally don't expect recognition for a sub par season and sub par performances in every competition (that includes the EL Final) Ivanovic went balls to the wall in every competition Im glad to see him there.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Very well, often regarded as the top in England/PL: (in no particular order)

Eric Steele

Gerry Peyton

Christophe Lollichon

John Achterberg

Louro (who's now working for us again as well so he counts as PL as of the new season, he's basically Mourinho's follower but he's worked with the worlds best keepers)

(Others in England:)
Stephen Pears? David Watson? Chris Woods? The other 4 (excluding lauro) are probably more talked about. Surprising that Man U are letting Steele leave, dunno who'll they'll be able to get.


In the rest of the world:

Joop Hiele (although I think he might have stopped coaching now)

Ochotorena (sp? the spanish GK coach/ old Liverpool coach when Reina was one of the best)

Vollborn (another German, they are good keepers historically, more or less responsible for Adler)

Pablo Vercelone

Alessandro Nista

There obviously are others, and a similar top 5 for each country but I don't know the strange clubs (not massively successful) that have particularly good goalkeeper development. Personally I'd only rate Vercelone, Ochotorena, Steele and Nista above Lollichon.

As far as Fulham go, Segers and Betinelli are good but not quite on the next level.

Obviously all of this is just my opinion.

It's the price you pay though, in my view, for a good democracy: people have different opinions, they discuss them openly, perhaps protest about them and it's not always gonna be pretty. But in that way you are much more likely to get change for the better, as people are interested and engaged and politicians are held accountable to the people continuously even outside of election time.

Our democracy looks nicer because there's less political violence and there is a broad consensus on many issues. But the apathy and misinformation (as seen by this research) that comes with this is probably much more damaging in the long run. It allows for media moguls, big businesses, and career politicians to steer our country to their own agenda which is not always congruent with the interests of broader society.

Obviously it's a difficult balance though, because you don't want such strongly bipolar opinions as to make the country ungovernable as a whole (what appears to be the case in Egypt at the moment, for instance) making civil conflict likely but enough to get people engaged in discussion (as your friends describe) and out on the streets when they deem it necessary.",0,1373402486,null,0,false,0,caz71u3,t3_1hxyyo,t1_caz71u3,t1_caz6g9x,null,1430527503,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In one respect this argues against the idea that Lollichon is a great/top 10 coach as he works well with Petr but there's little other evidence. For example, it could just be that he has an excellent relationship with Petr, although I would counter this with the idea that an excellent relationship is only one facet of a great coaches necessary arsenal.

Let's suppose somebody then came along and said ""hey, there are millions of possible coin toss sequences, you should keep tossing the coin until you hit 60 million, you've got no way of knowing whether this early run of roughly 50/50 heads and tails is a fluke or not"".  Would you take them seriously?  I wouldn't.  

Just as you don't need to toss a coin an infinite number of times to conclude that it's approximately fair, you don't need to interview a very big fraction of the UK's population before concluding that you know (approximately) how the whole population would respond to the question.  Although all this is dependent on your sample being an unbiased one of course: if you ask 1000 Sun readers things may not go well.

(I didn't mean that you should keep tossing the coin until you get exactly 50% heads and 50% tails, as it's actually unlikely that you will hit 50/50 precisely for any given large-ish number of throws with a fair coin.

I'll get this on film if possible. Of course, if I'm in a car, I'll show my license straight away as I know you've got the right to ask for that.

The reason for this is not to be difficult, but to make sure that if I'm at - hypothetically - a protest or filming fox-hunting or something like that, we'll both understand pretty quickly that each of us is going to have to act within the law, and just because the master of hounds owns half the village and is supposedly a pillar of the community, your colleagues are going to have to tell him that, no, we're not breaking any laws and they can't move us along or stop us filming, and if anyone going to be arrested, it'll probably be him, not us. 

I think that when interacting with the police the question 'Am I obliged to do this?' should always be asked and the response recorded, to every request in all cases. That's a bit different to 'faaack you, filth'  or 'I'm a trainee solicitor and know my rights' and can be done with civility on both sides.

If s/he knows about how the scarf was used to strangle the victim or, archetypically, ""where the bodies are buried"", s/he must've done it, right?  Wrong.  Certainly in cases where the police are already aware of information, it very easy for this to be transmitted to a suspect intentionally, or more likely unintentionally, to make a false confession even more compelling.

Secondly I'm not saying it's always or even often the police's fault (although, it seems to me it clearly is sometimes).

Probably doesn't have what I want on there, found this instead:

It is not fully understood how genetic changes cause Parkinson disease or influence the risk of developing the disorder. Many Parkinson disease symptoms occur when nerve cells (neurons) in the substantia nigra die or become impaired. Normally, these cells produce a chemical messenger called dopamine, which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements. When these dopamine-producing neurons are damaged or die, communication between the brain and muscles weakens. Eventually, the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement.

Makes perfect sense. 

I haven't read enough about neurons for the below to *completely* make sense to me though.

Some gene mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins in dopamine-producing neurons. As a result, undegraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of these cells. Other mutations may affect the function of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules called free radicals that can damage cells. Cells normally counteract the effects of free radicals before they cause damage, but mutations can disrupt this process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine-producing neurons.

The EU is becoming less and less significant relative to the rest of the world. The rest of the world is expanding at a far greater pace than the EU, and the EU cannot enlarge forever - Turkey is the limit, Russia will never join there's not much left.

The EU is becoming more powerful vs it's member states, and that's largely at the expense of democracy, and largely as a result of the financial crisis. Those aren't good reasons to support the EU in my opinion.

As far as EU power goes, I think it has too much power against the free market. African nations are kept in poverty due to trade barriers. We fund inefficient farming methods, the CFP is terrible etc.

So my view of the EU is that it's getting it's iron grip around the member nations and becoming more and more inward looking and protectionist.

The one area it does affect us is  buying a house. We are up against two salary families, pushing up property prices. Which is fair enough, it was our choice.

But ... as a taxpayer, I am subsidising their child care. That's right, I am paying to look after their kids, so they can out-compete me in the housing market. That is annoying.

I would prefer that to stop, but if they are offering tax breaks to stay at home mothers, that kind of evens things out a little.

Feck knows what 'undergraded' is

Uh. Well each cell contains proteins. So I'm guessing 'ungraded' is bad.

Each neuron is only meant to 'accept' it's own sort of transmitter, and dopamine is one of those iirc. If you have an usually high number of dopamine producing neurons, then there's an increased level of depression and suchlike.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;The EU is becoming more powerful vs it's member states, and that's largely at the expense of democracy, and largely as a result of the financial crisis. Those aren't good reasons to support the EU in my opinion.

I disagree there. The EU as it stands at the moment has a democratic deficit, but the EU has also become vastly more democratic as an organisation over time. It's created a fully elected body (the European Parliament), it's become much more transparent and it has a very new petitioning system. The EU itself is becoming much more democratic as time goes on, and if it continues that way it could well end up being more democratic than a lot of it's member states. For instance, the UK system very easily allows for minority government. Only one government since before World War Two has actually collected a majority of the votes and that one government is the 2010 *coalition* (keeping in mind, nobody votes for a coalition).

I agree that at the moment the EU has democratic problems, but I also think that it is democratising itself at a very fast pace, in line with the powers it is collecting. There's a reason that the EU was not democratic to start with. As time has gone on, the EU has started to make more and more of its decisions itself (rather than simply doing what national governments say) and thus, has become more democratic, but most of the decisions are still made by national governments and the EU's main job is still to simply facilitate that rather than be a decision making body itself. Do you think the civil service (which simply carries out the will of the government) should be voted in? So you can see why it wasn't democratic to start with and why now that's changing. 

&gt;As far as EU power goes, I think it has too much power against the free market. African nations are kept in poverty due to trade barriers. We fund inefficient farming methods, the CFP is terrible etc.

These are good points, but I'll remind you to compare it to other things. Yes, the EU has tariffs, but we would have more tariffs if we weren't in the EU. The whole world would be worse off if the Common Market wasn't there and if the Common Market wasn't protected from faulty products and certain practices by foreign companies (such as China and its subsidising of certain industries, which is why we can't have a free trade area with China). There are good reasons for having these tariffs in place. If we didn't have the EU, we would just have more tariffs anyway and then Eastern Europe and the former Fascist countries would probably be a lot more anti democratic, ect than they are now. 

Apart from the tariff point, I don't really get what you mean by "" think it has too much power against the free market.""

&gt;So my view of the EU is that it's getting it's iron grip around the member nations and becoming more and more inward looking and protectionist.

It's not so much that *it* has an iron grip around its member states, but that its member states have an iron grip around each other. Would you rather that we have an around grip around each other diplomatically and politically using the European Union, or would you rather that we be without the EU and run the risk of sorting out our problems militarily? That was the EU's original goal. To prevent war in Europe. 

&gt;The EU is becoming less and less significant relative to the rest of the world

I also have a slightly different emphasise here. *Europe* is becoming more and more marginal in world affairs. However, the European Union helps negate that slightly. Together, we form the largest economy on the planet (The GDP of the EU is larger than the GDP of the USA). We have a higher population than the USA. If the EU remains and becomes a real entity, it would allow is to remain one of the foremost world powers.

true,Variola13,,EtOH,"&gt;Feck knows what 'undergraded' is
Uh. Well each cell contains proteins. So I'm guessing 'ungraded' is bad.

Proteins, depending on their function are produced, carry out their function and are then degraded down back into their component parts and reused by the cell. This is to make sure that protein only does its function when it is supposed to, otherwise it could mooch about the cell and interfere with other cell functions. 

Cells have enzymes whose job is to degrade the unwanted/used proteins, if there is a mutation in the gene that codes for those enzymes, it might mean the cell produces faulty enzymes that don't do their job as efficiently, and so un-degraded proteins build up in the cell. They aggregate together and affect the working of the cell, and eventually kill it. So if that cell is one that produces dopamine, then it can cause the symptoms of Parkinson's.

I understand what you're saying about policing two sides of something and I've seen examples of both impartiality and its opposite. But some people do seem to think and act like they can ask police to move along or arrest people simply because they don't like what they're doing and I've seen mixed responses to this.

I've also seen an eviction where it was a good thing the police were there as the bailiffs were basically utter thugs who didn't have a clue about what they were and weren't allowed to do. That largely went to shit and no one got to go home early because although the police prevented the bailiffs from being as violent as they wanted to be, they also hadn't got the right paperwork on them and the police wouldn't stop them on those grounds either, which pissed me off.

But to come back to the first point, if a copper says to me 'I require you to do X and Y because of law Z in PACE or Section AB of the 1984 Whatever Act' then it's pretty much always going to be pointless arguing, and I'd prefer that than insincere pleasantries.

As far as emblems beside names go, I don't see that going to plan, nor do i see a lot of people wanting to describe themselves with an emblem. It works in GoT because it wants to be divided up into 'Families/Houses' and it is proud and honorable etc etc. My feeling is that of all the Countries in the World, the majority of Northern Ireland all want to be together under one wee white flag and live in peace and harmony like Hobbits in The Shire. I don't mean that we, the people, don't have our individual values, i just mean that we're fed up with the shite of being told we're divided, having two different histories and two different set of values and we want to maybe ignore it and pretend it doesn't happen.

Now, don't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from in suggesting town badges and not flags and it being proud of where you're from but herein lies my issue; Let's say i'm a cat person, i am from Lurgan, there are dogs on my town emblem, i don't want dogs beside my name because i don't identify with them.

Stop and search doesn't require that any Section 24 PACE (now SOCPA) element be active. At that point we wouldn't arrest for possession of the knife, we'd search for it. If its found then an offence is complete in terms of points and blades, also there is a potential affray or section 4 whether or not the person actually has the knife.

""But to come back to the first point, if a copper says to me 'I require you to do X and Y because of law Z in PACE or Section AB of the 1984 Whatever Act' then it's pretty much always going to be pointless arguing, and I'd prefer that than insincere pleasantries. ""

""also hadn't got the right paperwork on them and the police wouldn't stop them on those grounds either, which pissed me off.""

Police can't necessarily stop bailiffs. There may be no lawful grounds for doing so. If a warrant is in existence it doesn't necessarily have to be shown or at the scene, its existence is enough. This is the case with arrest warrants. As long as the warrant exists and the person is outstanding wanted they're arrestable. 

That may work for you but if I said that to the vast majority of people out there they'd look at me like I'd grown an extra head and swallowed a few law books that morning. ",0,1373408034,null,0,1373408353,0,caz99pj,t3_1hx5py,t1_caz99pj,t1_caz8qgd,null,1430526458,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

As you can expect, there are also not any Citi ATMS. However, I'm quite sure you can just write out cashiers cheques and transfer money that way or bring cash to convert or transfer money via western union (or if you're here for a while, open up a UK bank account and transfer it to that).

I hope that clears things up a bit - I know it's easy to get confused with the big banks internationally.

What people get wrong about democracy is that the opinion of the layman is valuable for its content. During the London Mayoral elections one of the points of contention was which candidates supported or opposed the opening of a third runway at Heathrow. **Asking the layman a question as specific as this is tantamount to taking a vote over what type of heart surgery would best fix a particular patient's ailment.** It's not merely that the layman is misinformed, but that the complexity of most political issues is such that they physically *cannot be informed* unless their job pertains to it. If you've a family and a 9-5 you don't really have much time for serious political discussion, and so most voting is based on gut instinct and personalities. 

Democracy is great because it guards the principles of consent, accountability, and power sharing. It means that if an administration is judged do be incompetent by the electorate (ie whatever strategies they advocate don't get results) they will be turfed out. Which is why it is important to have an electoral system that stops politicians from feeling too safe. There are downsides to this, but it is better than any of the alternatives considered yet. Which is, er, also something Churchill may have said.

Suarez is a goal-scoring striker with a creative attacking midfielder all in one person and there are less than 10 people in the world who can replace him, none of which are going to come to a 7th place club. We need him here to keep building. Have him give us one more season and then if we don't hit top 4 (or even if we do), I have no issues with him leaving. I'd be greatly disappointed if he left this summer but it's his decision to hand in a request or not and he has NEVER said anything bad about Liverpool so no harm no foul just yet, although the way he's been going on about telling people he doesn't want to leave is annoying.

He's definitely not going to an English side because the media would continue to crucify him regardless of where he goes in the country and FSG/LFC won't sell him to a rival unless they pay a pretty penny. Real interest has died down and really no other club that can afford him actually needs him, so I think he'll stay this summer.

Also the day before the determination is made involved parties are allowed to present evidence to the commission to state their case, pro or against, the commissioners cannot question the validity of the claims made so one may lie (as was the case in Armagh with a band parade on St. Patrick's day) and you will likely get away with it unless somebody shows up with evidence to the contrary, which rarely happens due to ignorance and obstanance. 

This particular case is odd, it is particularly stronger than last year, despite the attempts made in these past few days (which I would have thought would/should have been started a month ago), to ease the tension. Of course you have the violence that arises from this stretch every year despite determinations added to legacy of the fleg protests. However I can't help but feel the PC has lost sight of the bigger picture where the riots have arisen despite the determinations every year, (often involving people who arn't locals coming in specifically for it,) we have, to a certain extent, given in to the rioters.

-
&gt;Yes. Foreign aid is a small proportion of total spending, although eliminating it could halve council tax bills. I know what I would like to do.

-
&gt;I suppose you realise that immigrants are a greater proportion of children - which shows the drift of our demographics - so we WILL lose our country eventually - which is just how you, Chivers, like it. 

-
&gt;For example the politicial and media class covered up 1000s of children being raped, tortured and forced into child prostitution because it conflicted with political correctness.

-
&gt;Therefore, those who rightly point out that our Common Law system is incompatible with the ECHR and that we must therefore withdraw from the ECHR must also agree to a withdrawal from the EU.

-
&gt;You have aircraft carriers without any planes that can fly off them. Your government is about to impose controlled blackouts to prevent power outages brought about by its own policy to decommission workable energy plants and replace them with unworkable wind turbines - for no other reason than to ""set an example to the world."" Your health system routinely kills people. The airport into your capital is so congested and unworkable that businessmen do not want to fly into it.  And 80% of your laws come from a hostile foreign entity to which your government, without the consent of the electorate, simply handed over power. You have an immigration policy to let in millions of individuals from a hostile ideology, who hate you and your political and cultural values and who promptly receive welfare as they denounce you.

&gt;Unless we are talking about Zimbabwe or Haiti, it's hard to think of how more broken you could be.

An obvious problem is people use terminology differently, if we are comparing perceptions, this must be accounted for:
e.g. did they make clear to survey participants that by Muslim they mean only practicing Muslims, not someone from a Muslim background? (it appears their comparison is recent census data of self-declared practicing Muslims only), the official immigration rate given as comparison is for first generation immigrants, not including second or third generation, were survey participants made aware of this distinction?

true,bustanuttson,null,null,"        While maybe he has gotten more clinical since joining, albeit only slightly, the talent has ALWAYS been there. It wasn't until he played in one of the top leagues that it was going to be internationally recognized. He tore up this league from the minute he arrived. 

         That being said, you don't need your lone striker to score 30-40 goals a year. Just look at Bayern this year, they scored goals from everywhere on the pitch and Mandzukic was key to that, simply because he bought into their high pressing style of play and was willing to work for the team. Suarez, although clearly one of the best players in the world, often loses the ball taking a player on when there are other better options. This isn't the style Rodgers is trying to implement into the squad. We all know he prefers the slick, pass and move, possession based game where the ball is kept and opponents are chasing shadows. He would be brilliant in a team like Real Madrid who rely on individual skill and devastating counter attacks, Bayern too just because of his willingness to work for the team.

      So if we lose Suarez this is what should happen. We need a player capable of linking well, working hard for the team, and comfortable on the ball. If he happens to be a brilliant goal scorer than great, but if he's only a 14-20 goal scorer a year and the rest of the team chips in with the rest (Bayern reference again), then we are very capable of finishing in the top four. Benteke for me, would be a brilliant player for Liverpool and with the chance creation around him from Sturridge, Countinho, Gerrard and (hopefully) Aspas, I would be surprised if he didn't score 30 goals a year.

By absolute definition of physics, it must travel through all the dimensions that exist in real space-time, which means it travels through at least 26 dimensions.

The dimensions I am referring to are the dimensions that ""strings"" can vibrate in for each of the two fundamental particles.

As the Doctor would say, Fermions and Bosons are slightly off in how they are wibbly and wobbly, but they certainly don't just limit themselves to being ""timey-wimey"".


That being said, the multi-verse theory you seem to be thinking of could be comprised of an infinite sink full of soapy suds, with our universe being one of those tiny little soap bubbles.  We may have already detected evidence of several of these other ""bubbles"" actually touching our ""bubble"", which is essentially how the TARDIS works.  It's dimensionally transcendent.  The inside of the TARDIS exists far from the outside of the TARDIS but because of their shared vibration, they occupy the same structure, thus comprising the ""magic"" of the bigger-on-the-inside TARDIS.

true,troist,null,null,"I found the full list of misconceptions and sources for anyone who would prefer to follow up these statistics (I removed the sources in the quote, couldn't be bothered with all the reformatting, link to original article at the bottom):

&gt;1. **Teenage pregnancy**: on average, we think teenage pregnancy is 25 times higher than official estimates: we think that 15% of girls under 16 get pregnant each year, when official figures suggest it is around 0.6%. 

&gt;2. **Crime**: 58% do not believe that crime is falling, when the Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that incidents of crime were 19% lower in 2012 than in 2006/07 and 53% lower than in 1995. 51% think violent crime is rising, when it has fallen from almost 2.5 million incidents in 2006/07 to under 2 million in 2012.

&gt;3. **Job-seekers allowance**: 29% of people think we spend more on JSA than pensions, when in fact we spend 15 times more on pensions (£4.9bn vs £74.2bn).

&gt;4. **Benefit fraud**: people estimate that 34 times more benefit money is claimed fraudulently than official estimates: the public think that £24 out of every £100 spent on benefits is claimed fraudulently, compared with official estimates of £0.70 per £100.

&gt;5. **Foreign aid**: 26% of people think foreign aid is one of the top 2-3 items government spends most money on, when it actually made up 1.1% of expenditure (£7.9bn) in the 2011/12 financial year. More people select this as a top item of expenditure than pensions (which cost nearly ten times as much, £74bn) and education in the UK (£51.5bn).

&gt;6. **Religion**: we greatly overestimate the proportion of the population who are Muslims: on average we say 24%, compared with 5% in England and Wales. And we underestimate the proportion of Christians: we estimate 34% on average, compared with the actual proportion of 59% in England and Wales.

&gt;7. **Immigration and ethnicity**: the public think that 31% of the population are immigrants, when the official figures are 13%. Even estimates that attempt to account for illegal immigration suggest a figure closer to 15%. There are similar misperceptions on ethnicity: the average estimate is that Black and Asian people make up 30% of the population, when it is actually 11% (or 14% if we include mixed and other non-white ethnic groups).

&gt;8. **Age**: we think the population is much older than it actually is – the average estimate is that 36% of the population are 65+, when only 16% are.

&gt;9. **Benefit bill**: people are most likely to think that capping benefits at £26,000 per household will save most money from a list provided (33% pick this option), over twice the level that select raising the pension age to 66 for both men and women or stopping child benefit when someone in the household earns £50k+. In fact, capping household benefits is estimated to save £290m, compared with £5bn for raising the pension age and £1.7bn for stopping child benefit for wealthier households.

&gt;10. **Voting**: we underestimate the proportion of people who voted in the last general election – our average guess is 43%, when 65% actually did.
