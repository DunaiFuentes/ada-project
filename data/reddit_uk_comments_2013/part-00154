I'm trying to imagine the people *left* in Luton preferring a near dead ghost town with even poorer infrastructure due to low tax income as opposed to now.

Luton in the 50's had just over 100,000 people in it...around the same time Vauxhall employed upwards of 36,000 people. Over a quarter of the people relied on a single factory for their livelihood as well as all the businesses that relied on those people having a steady income, like local shops, restaurants and pubs. 

Fast forward to today and we have a much downsized factory that only employs just over 1,000 people. It's not like the Asians moved in and turfed white people out of their homes...they left of their own volition, most probably to find work elsewhere.

As for Huawei scrutiny, it's a bit late for that.

I force myself to be ignorant but we're nowhere near as good as the other top teams. We've got Coutinho, Suarez, Gerrad, Agger and now Mignolet, but apart from that I think we need to replace the other 6 in the starting 11 if we're gonna get anywhere near the level we were in 08/09.

We've fucked ourself with the stadium. We should have been building that right after our Champions League success. Higgs and Gillette really did a number on us. That should be the *priority* as far as I'm concerned. In might take a decade of treading water, but that's the situation we find ourselves in.

I think the owners have looked at Dortmund and thought ""We'll just do that."" Putting it into practice is impossibly difficult. When the rumours surfaced about the Saudi oil company wanting to buy the club by heart soared a little. The reality is that's the kind of money we need to in order to compete. Look at the top 4 teams. Chelsea and City are funded by billionaires, United is one of the richest clubs in the world, and now Arsenal are flush with cash. Money wins you titles. It's sad but true. If we don't make strides this year I think we'll start to see our best players itching to leave.

The only hope I have is that in two seasons, players like Ibe, Sterling, Suso, Wisdom, Kelly, Coutinho, Sturridge, all the young ones, form a great team. It's a big ask. 

I don't think we should judge until this transfer window is over. We were prepared to spend £20 million on Mkhitaryan so obviously we are willing to part with cash. I do think we have to sell to buy though, that's just how they run the club. We think we're preparing for when FFP comes into action, but clubs like City couldn't give a fuck and therefore the whole thing becomes redundant.

The reality is we need to lower our expectations. It's quite possible that we won't get back into to the Champions League for the foreseeable future. It's fucking heartbreaking and it makes me want to cry, but that's where the club is. City, Chelsea, United, with the money at their disposal will always be fighting for those top 3 spots. We like to think fourth place is between us, Spurs and Arsenal but really Arsenal have got that nailed down, even more so this season with the money they have to spend.

All this is the fucking horrible reality we're in now. I know one thing though. We could finish sixth for the next 50 years and I wouldn't support the club any less.

I am not saying that there is passport free entry or exit to EEA countries. I am saying no one is keeping an accurate record of who is moving to stay on a longer term basis, at least in this country. Spain's system might be something that would work here to ensure that people are who they say they are, but remember Spain also requires everyone to carry ID cards. That is something that Labour was going to implement, but there was a lot of backlash. Whether Spain is better at keeping track of who actually stays on as a resident, I can't say one way or another. The attitude towards ID and databases is a lot different there than here.

Edit: We'd not only have to keep databases on non-EEA immigrants, but on EEA, UKCs, and those having right of abode in order to get accurate net migration statistics. The statistics that the Home Office definitely has is the number of people applying for and receiving leave to enter and remain as non-EEA citizens. I think that a lot of people are walking away from this story with the idea that there is no accounting when it comes to visas issued. 

They also don't keep track of people who then go home while holding these leaves. However, if they try to enter after the leave is expired or if too much time has elapsed since you were a resident of the UK(for instance, more than two years if you have indefinite leave to remain), they won't let you back in without applying for fresh leave.

This was refreshingly honest to read. This is the only real objection - people don't want it, and don't think it is needed. That is all. Too much over-the-top rhetoric about censorship and free speech has been thrown around over the issue, none of which really applies. You don't need to be name-calling and blaming the supporters of being bad parents, or be making bold claims that the filters won't work, or any of that rubbish. Just put your cards on the table and say you don't want it. We're a democracy after all.

It's unpopular legislation, and the way you get the most support is just by being totally frank about the fact that you don't want it. Nobody wants to hear your essay on human rights.

Non-students are not always welcomed so it is best to drop them an e-mail asking about it and what days and times they run sessions. E-mail addresses can be found through the relevant student unions. Just turn up and someone will probably notice you are new, especially if it is something specialist like debating, and be happy to direct you to the right people aka a training officer, the secretary you contacted etc.

Most societies give you a few free sessions before they ask for a membership fee for the semester. The amount can vary depending on which society you want to join but generally isn't that much.

Pretty much, as long as they take non-students then you are just like any other member of the society to them and the best time to give them a go is in the first few weeks of a term when all of the first years are being inducted anyway.

The only way up is if we get large investors in. We will be stuck at the edge of the top 4 for a long time at this rate. Constantly selling our best players. Or at least holding them against their will.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;but the idea that drug addicts are making bad choices they shouldn't be allowed to make was a considerable part of your argument. 

I think we should do our best to deter them from making the wrong decisions. Current drug policy doesn't work perfectly, that much is obvious, but the police do confiscate drugs and addicts do seek treatment. No country that's comparably advanced to the UK has ever legalized everything as far as I know, so it's not our place to claim whether or not that would reduce the public cost or the addiction rates. I'd suspect that given the UK tends to bubble wrap its citizens (internet filter, no weapons, world famed health and safety regulation) people wouldn't accurately gauge how dangerous some substances are if we just legalized them and stuck a label on them. Something like Codeine has to be prescribed in ""real"" doses, so making morphine/heroin available without it wouldn't fit with the current safety standards, and making them prescription based would still leave a market for illegal dealers.

&gt;But they aren't safeguards at all. The type of person who is detered drugs law isn't really the type of person to is most vulnerable to becoming addicted anyway.

Again, we've never seen whether those people would start taking drugs or not so that's not really for anyone to say. I think a lot of people *are* put off by the stigma that the law helps.

&gt;That argument doesn't hold at all, cocaine can only be cultivated in a subtropical climate, even hydroponics are useless since it's impossible to yield the crop in the quantities needed for economical cocaine cultivation.

But legal pharmaceuticals can't be grown in a shitty field in central america and shipped in a container, they have to be carefully monitored every step of the way to make sure nothing gets added or taken, then packed in a sterile environment. You can't soak leaves in gasoline or battery acid, you have to use medically safe alternatives.

Also the whole back end of  production is highly illegal in the countries it happens in - GSK aren't exactly going to be able to approach the guy growing for a cartel in peru and win him over with a slightly higher rate.

&gt;The production methods require highly controlled chemicals, all this contributes to the sheer cost of the illegal industry needed to supply demand.

Theft is free, buying through the proper channels isn't. It's not really possible that producing the drugs legitimately would be cheaper than not doing as far as I can see.

The problem is what you're describing isn't really an 'investment' in the way that the hundreds of millions Shiekh Mansour has loaned City is not an investment as it's incredibly unlikely to ever generate a return.  It's really a gift.  

What you're looking for is someone like Mansour or Abramovich who are willing to essentially just spend lots and lots of money for the sake of the club and, in general, billionaires don't get that way by spending extravagant sums of money on their desires (Paul Allen and Larry Ellison aside) with no hope of return.  I suppose it's possible there is someone out there that would do so for LFC, but again, if there was and they were credible a phone call to JWH would get them the club.

I do believe FSG would sell the club in a heartbeat if someone came along and offered them say ~500M for it.  I suspect they expected that the club was much better off financially then it really was and, due to the nature of the deal and the speed at which it went through,  I don't think their due diligence was very good.

Wasn't allowed internet in my bedroom, had to pay 2/3rds of my wage as rent and restricted choices of food. Don't get me wrong - I had a good upbringing, well looked after and loving/caring family but certain aspects of life were curtailed/restricted due to a controlling stepdad. Couldn't be reasoned with, everything was/is his way. Everyday there were arguments, slammed doors, fallings out - all over trivial matters such as who ate the last biscuit or who didn't turn off the lights or who didn't wait on him whilst he watched sports. Meals were uncomfortable, made any excuse not to be there and basically destroyed all my social skills trying to cope. So approaching a subject like this would have certainly ended in a flat no. 


So yeh, parents can still control your life up until you move out with out any chance of a reasonable discussion or reasoning. Pathetic yes, but as I was constantly reminded - Its their house, their rules and now I can't get his stupid ranting voice out of my head every time I leave a light on, break a plate, blah blah.

If you are after Trout which most people are then there are options:

* [The Farmoor Reservoir](http://www.farmoor-reservoir.com/) is supposedly good and pretty cheap.
* [Blenheim Palace](http://www.blenheimpalace.com/theestate/trout-fishery.html) 
* I've heard there are places up north west ( closeish to The Trout inn ) but I'm not sure how or where and they aren't in the guide I link below.

The problem is how you fish as well to be honest. Most people around here angle and you could do spin fishing in most places. Personally I fly fish and it's pretty hard finding spots to do that.

Additionally, given your other thread it seems like you aren't from the UK then there are a couple of things needed to be said about licences: You need a rod license which you can get from the post office ( get the coarse fishing one, there are no migratory trout or salmon here ). Then you need to get a fishing permit. There are a number of options and generally the waters are divided up between various angling associations. In general, you need to pick water before you pick license but for the sake of argument NOAA is pretty good and so is Marston AC ( if I remember the name correctly ) as they give you access to the Cherwell and Port Meadow and so forth.

If you want to scout around for waters before answering the above questions then have a look at the [guide by the Environment Agency](http://a0768b4a8a31e106d8b0-50dc802554eb38a24458b98ff72d550b.r19.cf3.rackcdn.com/GEHO0309BRWL_E_E_04f51e.pdf). Typical fish in the canals seems to be Barbel, Chub, Dace, Roach and Perch. The guide also tells you who is the licensee of that water stretch so you can decide whom you want to get a license with.

Once you've decided then get your licences from Fat Phils down south in Abingdon - you need to get a bus from St. Aldates but it's the easiest unless you live up Marston way where there are options.",0,1375046702,null,0,false,0,cbc5uyr,t3_1j83x2,t1_cbc5uyr,t3_1j83x2,null,1430234120,4,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,4

Here's the problem. We fucked up with Dalglish. We spent over £100 million on mediocre players and have nothing to show for it. Spending the kind of money we did on Carroll, Downing, Henderson, Adam, will haunt us for years. FSG got stung. I don't care if the net spend wasn't large, it's still their money. We could have bought some serious talent with that money and we're playing catch up now. They're not going to be as forthcoming with the cash now.

The same comparison is often made about the Eurozone too, but I dont buy it personally.

true,Jenquers,null,null,"Great question. Long answer.

I'm actually part of a small contingent of fans that desperately wanted Higuain over Suarez, for reasons I've already posted in this thread a week or so back (check my history if you're interested). So much for that. I had my fingers crossed that Madrid would make an offer for Suarez, but recent news seems to indicate that Perez is setting his sights on Bale, and with the money that is being reported, I think even the painfully stubborn (bias) Daniel Levy will have to let him go. 

I still haven't answered your question though. Given all of this, do I think Arsenal will sign Suarez before the end of the window? Yes, I actually do, and here's why: I think Suarez went into this summer (given what he has been saying to the media) pretty intent on leaving Liverpool. Madrid was his preferred destination, but that no longer appears to be an option because of Bale. In fact, as far as we all know, no other clubs have made a bid for Suarez. I believe this has come as a pretty big shock to both Suarez and his agent. Was it his antics that scared off foreign teams? His suspension that concerned other outfits in the PL? I can't honestly say, but after the season that Suarez just had, purely stats wise, I believe he expected more interest from clubs, and rightfully so. Now he finds himself in a position where the only team earnestly bidding for him is Arsenal. They need a striker (Giroud is not first-option-striker-quality on a team trying to compete for silverware) so he is guaranteed playing time, and, most importantly, CL. His brand has taken a huge hit over the past year, and it will be difficult for him to recover that while staying with Liverpool. That might not sound right to a Liverpool fan, who would argue that his image would significantly worsen if he ditched a team that stuck by him through thick and thin, but the Suarez camp realizes that a fresh start in a new environment gives him the best chance to rehabilitate his image. And yes, even if he stays in England. Despite his gripe about the English press, we all know that Suarez is fully to blame for his PR issues and that the papers would treat his ill conceived remarks to a slightly hyperbolic Frenchman and his decision to dine on Ivanovic’s arm the same way no matter what country he was in.

I understand that it seems like it's entirely unfeasible for Liverpool to sell their star player to a team that most people in this sub believe can compete with Arsenal for the 4th spot. The reality is, you can’t.  Spurs and Arsenal and going to be duking it out again for that position regardless of where Suarez ends up. AFC has qualified for 16 consecutive CL's. 16. Even if we don’t make any significant addition (and we will, our Puma deal has essentially assured that) we would still be capable of qualifying. I am careful to use the word capable here, not guaranteed.  Spurs are either going to have Bale (along with a number of other promising signings...ugh that was painful to write) and be a stronger side than Liverpool, or sell Bale to Madrid for some absolutely exorbitant sum and reinvest towards more quality signings, making them just as incredible (if not better depending on if the figures are true, and if they are, wow. That's nearly a quarter of Tottenham's net worth http://www.forbes.com/teams/tottenham-hotspur/). 

Liverpool are heading in a great direction and with Rodgers at the helm, LFC’s days of non-Champions League play are numbered. But next season is not your time. Not yet. Giving the promising young talent you have though, when the squad does finally come into full form, they're going to be scary. Presently though, purely from a footballing, marketing and fiscal point of view, all signs point to Suarez moving on to Arsenal. Can things change given that it’s still early in the window? Sure. But IMHO, Luis Suarez will be sporting the Arsenal crest before the window closes.

TL:DR Suarez is probably going to Arsenal.

I'm not sure how the Hazard comparison is entirely relevant. Each individual develops at a different pace - it just so happens that Hazard has done so very quickly. 

An attacking midfield comprised of: 
Hazard - Oscar - Mata

would work well and conforms to the traditions which Mourinho has been using at his previous clubs with the right sided midfielder (typically left footed) cutting inside - see Duff, Robben, Pandev, Di Maria and Ozil for example. 

Mata is certainly suitable for this role and one of the few players in the squad for it. Hazard stays where he is and this allows for the continued development of Oscar centrally.

While it might still exist in some form or another, if addicts can reliably get sufficient quantity of medicial grade, controlled strength heroin for a reasonable price from the pharmacy the market for illegal heroin will be paltry in comparison to today.

True, and- if they could figure out a way to ensure doses stay safe and consistent- that wouldn't be such a bad idea, cost aside. If you're just giving addicts heroin with no rehab element then that's not really productive, you just shift the cost of their addiction from the public as individials  to the public through government

&gt;Obviously the inital costs for whoever hoped to open up the legal cocaine industry would be in the hundreds of millions at least, but once the machinery and organisation were in place a legal operation would eventually save far more money than you could by using the current illegal methods.

But if you're trying to undercut/compete with illegal dealers, then your profits are going to be pretty dismal and the ROI compared to, say, copying an esoteric drug coming out of patent, fudging some numbers to make your variation seem slightly better, then selling it wouldn't be great either. I just don't see how you could make money off of competing with people who don't have to follow safety regulations, pay taxes, or ensure they have an uncontaminated product, even if you can produce with less waste. I have no idea what the yield of cocaine on making it cheap actually is, but unless it was something like 10% then th

&gt;I think you underestimate the degree to which money talks, if you made cocaine sale and production legitmate you would be able to go through political channels. Once the politicians in South America realised they could legitimise the export I think you'd find many legal cocaine growing operations cropping up to meet demand. 

true, but even if you could convince them you'd just be throwing more money at competing with criminals. 

&gt;When I say the chemicals needed to make to make MDMA and LSD are controlled I mean that there are only a few corporations in the country with the correct licences to handle them. Stealing them would mean stealing from a major pharmaceutical or chemical company with full teams of security etc. 

But that's wrong, because LSD and MDMA *are* synthesized even though the chemicals involved are controlled. If it weren't possible to produce them then they just wouldn't exist.

IF we do get that kind of owners sure it'll attract talented players to come, but will they play for the club or for the money?

Will we even see youth players breaking in the first team squad with all players that come in every season? Look at chelsea and city, how much homegrown players do they have in their first team?

Very pacey, young Paraguayan who grew up playing in attack and was only recently converted to left-back by Jorge Jesus at Benfica.

Like Enrique, has the pace to recover when beaten and can fend for himself. 

Would provide real competition for Jose. He has European experience and has performed pretty well against the higher-end Portuguese outfits. I would be excited if he joined. More fit for the Liverpool first team than Robbo at the moment and should Enrique be injured, he could prove to be very capable coverage if not really push Enrique if he makes a few costly errors.

Only issue is his availability. He has a rather large buy-out clause in his contract with a more than a few years left on it. I think Benfica might be willing to loan him out but I'd be curious to see the future fee included to the deal. But I do think this would be a great loan signing and if he proves himself in the league, would really give us a great option at left back.

Good players want to play in clubs competing at the top. There is no real loyalty from modern footballers towards a team.

Gerrard and co are a dying breed. In fairness its a 2 way street. 

A club wants loyalty from its best players but if your not up to grade will happily ship you out!

Being a long time supporter of the club it is very difficult for myself and some others to take the lack of progress by the club regarding playing staff. 

We are a big club but that won't last forever unless we provide a playing squad capable of challenging at the top.

That's why we are losing our best striker this summer.

It is nice to think there is another way to the top but in the modern game,  unfortunately, money talks and bullshit walks. We are being left further behind. Some of us are getting desperate now.

Mig and Kolo have been very sharp in the pre-season matches and look like they've settled in already. Joe Allen looks like he found his form again and has been playing further up the pitch during these pre-season matches. Hendo's gotten better I think. He too, has been playing further up the pitch and his engine is causing defences problems. I think Alberto is going to struggle for a little while. I think the strength and pace of the prem will be too much for him for a few months. Lucas has been solid and Stevie is just amazing as usual. Agger has been a rock and Johnson and Enrique have too. Personally I've been really impressed with Ibe and Sterling. We already know Sterling has a bright future and Ibe is in the same boat. I really can't write how excited I am about these two and their future's here at the club. Courtino is a brilliant player(we all knew this)and has been excellent this tour.

&gt;Others said regional managers may reduce staff hours if targets are not met.

Store managers cutting hours happened more often than it didn't if we weren't on target for sales that week. But isn't that common in retail? It doesn't seem like a noteworthy thing.

All in all, Sports Direct is a pretty crap place to work part time. You have no guaranteed hours, the store is almost always understaffed, and by the time I left the company became so focused on pushing KPIs that selling them became more important than helping customers or being good at your job. I think the full time staff actually had it worse though, in spite of the excellent share scheme.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"* Mignolet: Top top keeper, i'm really glad we signed him. I think he has proven over the past couple years that he is one of the best keepers in the league. Had a few fantastic saves over the past couple games but other than that he was rarely troubled. That in itself is a good sign though. I can remember plenty of times where Reina has had nothing to do for a whole match then 1 shot random comes in and they score. He seemed to turn off when he had nothing to do.

* Toure: Has played extremely well. Barely troubled but has made a number of fantastic blocks. Both him and Agger seem to be on the same wavelength which is good to see.

* Aspas: Hard to say at this point but he looks like he could be a quality player. Just seems like a direct upgrade for Downing. 3 goals in 3 games, though not especially spectacular, he gets in good positions and scores goals (something Downing lacks). His passing hasnt been that amazing but he has still linked up quite well with Gerrard and Coutinho (as well as Sterling vs Indonesia).

* Alberto: Haven't really seen much of him. He seems very comfortable on the ball and definitely has an eye for a pass. He has been played much deeper than I expected, as I thought he would be played in that AM role. I really hope he is groomed for that AM role because we are seriously lacking in that position when we push Coutinho out to LW. He seems very talented though and his versatility is definitely another strength. It is good to have players like Aspas, Alberto, Suarez, and Coutinho who can move about and play a number of positions throughout a match effortlessly. 

Besides our new signings just a couple notes:

* I have mentioned this before but I really don't like the midfield 3 of Lucas, Gerrard, Allen. It just feels like it is missing that offensive pressure / threat. It would be perfect with the Gerrard of 08/09 but now it seems like Gerrard / Allen should be fighting for the same position in the CM role and not both playing it. 

* Borini has done absolutely nothing to prove he has a place in our side. When you have players like Coutinho and Aspas picking apart the side and Borini still ends up being invisible against a weak team it really does not look good. He doesn't seem to link up well with anyone and lacks the pace or skill to be a threat on his own. He's still young though so we have to give him a bit more time. He could end up being a new Kuyt like player.

* I really want to see a lineup of:

---------------------Mignolet--------------------

Johnson------Toure------Agger---------Enrique

-------------Lucas------------Gerrard----------------

--------------------Coutinho-------------------

-------Aspas------------------------Suarez----

Sounds good, if you can figure out how tolerant they are first. 

&gt;Sure they don't need to pay tax or follow regulation, but neither can they do business openly and on the level.

why do they need to if they can launder the money? If I understand right most of the money goes to cartels who aren't at all concerned with that kinda thing anyway, and dealers pocket the rest for themselves. They don't necessarily *want* a legitimate business, just a source of income. 

If the system did go into place they wouldn't be able to become legitimate because most dealers probably don't have the qualifications they need to work in a pharmacy, and good paying work isn't exactly throwing itself at people nowadays.

&gt;Drug lords can't buy the technology or industrial means of production that legal business have access to

But they don't need to- even if you're using a method with shitty efficiency you can compete with the higher costs the legitimate company would incur farming, shipping, and manufacturing. This is devolving into  ""I think, you think"" though so maybe we should leave it at this :D

&gt;I'm pretty sure some of those criminals would be jumping at the chance to legitimise their empires since many of them seem to be good friends with the politicians anyway. 

The cartel doesn't have the empire though, the people growing the leaves are doing it for subsistence and sell to the highest bidder. If you legalised coca you'd be doing the cartels a massive disfavor because if they don't have a monopoly, they can't control prices anymore.

&gt;But that means criminals stealing from other criminals, do you not see a problem with saying well criminals well always have the upper hand this market since they can steal from other criminals. 

The chemicals have to come from somewhere- either they can be synthesized without theft (in which case it doesn't matter that only a few companies have a supply) or they can't (and theft clearly happens already). If criminals decide to steal from each other there's no net effect, not sure why that's relevant though.

true,Gaz133,null,null,"I think you are right about Higuain but I think it's because he was actually a realistic target. There's just not many ways that Liverpool are going to sell their best player to Arsenal. If you come in and Godfather us then ok, but Arsenal are trying to play some game where they are trying to get a fair deal and you're just not getting a fair deal on this. I generally agree that this Liverpool squad is not as good as Arsenal or Tottenham but if we have Suarez I think there is a SHOT and I think the management knows this and knows that if we sell him to Arsenal we're punting the season. There are very few scenarios where they're going to come to this decision. 

My main point is that I think Arsenal painted themselves into a corner by not signing someone earlier and now of the elite strikers available they're down to Suarez and Rooney. Rooney is either going to Chelsea or nowhere and Liverpool don't want to sell Suarez so there's no reason for Liverpool to do anything but laugh at these offers right now. 

I don't think Luis Suarez will be in an Arsenal shirt on Aug 31. I think he's either going to Madrid or staying until at least January (when Arsenal can still buy him because he's not cup tied this year). I have found it interesting going between our two subs and seeing the reactions to this story. Pretty much every Arsenal fan thinks Arsenal are a huge step up for him and he's sure to force his way through and pretty much every Liverpool fan thinks it's a lateral move and there's no way he's going. Obviously I side more with the Liverpool fan but we'll see. If Arsenal sign Bernard and Suarez they may have a shot at a title and if Liverpool keep him they may have a shot at 4th so whatever way it goes will be huge.

I mean, if you insist on playing Schurrle-Hazard-Mata, then we have to ask what happens to de Bruyne, Moses and Oscar. So your suggestion doesn't really solve that problem. And to be honest, Schurrle will get a lot of playing time with our busy schedule, so don't worry about that.

I think putting Hazard in the centre is tricky since he'd be too close to potentially two CBs as well as a holding midfielder/anchorman if the other team chooses to play with one. Mata has already demonstrated that he knows how to create space for himself in that position. Having Hazard cut in from the left against what is presumably going to be a right-footed defender/wingback at the other teams defensive position is a nightmare to deal with. He'll have more opportunity to beat a man and it forces the defender to go narrow using his weaker side to defend, which then would force the other team to involve either the anchorman or the right CB. This opens up space for our striker(s), and also gives Mata just that extra space to operate with. I don't think Schurrle alone could afford the CAM that kind of opportunity, and as I already stated, I think Mata is better at picking out passes and spreading play than Hazard.

Hazard is a better dribbler, he's quicker and he can take on a defender much better than Mata.

&gt;Firstly I suggest you look up what an Internet troll is before you suggest that they're wanting to 'get back' at this woman. Trolls don't care about the issue, they just saw an easy target to annoy and went for her.
You cannot blame other people for fear of crime when the actual chances of getting raped are near to none. The number will always be too high when it's above 0, but stop playing the victim. It's the kind of behaviour that moved people to oppose feminism.

This thread is not about threats of violence against women. It's about people with no lives finding someone to troll that they know will definitely respond. That is the argument you are derailing. It's the same argument the press are derailing by claiming that this is an attack on women everywhere. It's not. This is not an issue about the subjugation of women.

I wouldn't say you're a jerk, I just get angry sometimes over this because IRL I can't bring myself to talk about it to anyone. It's sad really.

Their ""build with youth"" approach is obviously a long play, but it *needs* to be...long-term stability of a promising regime yields dynasties, not just one-off champions. To that end, I think BR is the best possible hire they could have made. He's young, passionate, brilliant, and is on the same page with the ownership. I haven't been this excited about our U23 roster maybe *ever*, which is obviously great for the future, but they've also managed to bring in extremely talented young players who look ready to tear up the league *right now*.

2. The government is blocking certain content, and not allowing access even if you ask.

If the answer is (1) I'd argue it's more of an inconvenience than actual censorship, because the information is freely available to you on demand.  If it's (2), this is an entirely different issue and not one that we have been told about, so therefore things are far more serious.

No, sorry, it isn't.

Being threatened with rape by internet trolls is something that is faced uniquely by women. 

This is a threat that uniquely affects women because they all know someone that has experienced it. 

Men might get death threats on the internet, but murder is considerably less common.

I don't know how to have a reasonable discussion this about with you - I'm sure that more women empathise with you than you understand. Based on your experience, surely you should be on the side of people saying ""it's not ok to threaten rape"" and you should be accepting that it's a legitimate and horrible fear, instead of dismissing it as an ""irrational … lurking on every corner"".

I did take a quick look at the group that's campaigned for this - [Lose the Lads' Mags](http://www.losetheladsmags.org.uk/) - and their arguments appear to be, for the most part, fairly well reasoned, providing references to a few reports by the American Psychological Association. 

Having said that, the groups arguments for shops refusing to stock the mags, as opposed to just having them being sold in bags, comes across as at best selfish, and at worst mildly hysterical. I'll quote their FAQ:

&gt; **Would moving the lads’ mags to the top shelf solve the problem?**

&gt; Employees are still required to handle them – by putting them on the shelf or when selling them to purchasing customers.

This would be a valid concern if you were being asked to handle Uranium-235, not a magazine you find distasteful. It's a fact of life that at times we have to interact with things we personally don't like. The correct course of action is to deal with it and move on, not try and surgically remove that thing from your life.

&gt; **“If you don’t like lads’ mags, don’t buy them!”**

&gt; That’s the whole point. Because high-street supermarkets and newsagents sell them, people who don’t want to see them, people who are just going about their work or doing their food shopping, are exposed to them. Lads’ mags have no place in high-street supermarkets or newsagents.

Let me get this straight. If I see something I don't like, I can demand that thing be removed from public areas? Do you realize how self-centered that is? You're demanding that everyone conforms to your sensibilities. Maybe I'm alone on this, but I see things I don't like every day, but I don't ask for them to be hidden from me. I can recognize others enjoy them, and that they aren't put there simply to annoy me, so I don't get annoyed.

In short, #10 is typically a creative, tricky player who links the midfield in attack. The association of #10 and this position comes from the fact that teams in the olden days usually numbered their players 1-11 by position. #1 was the keeper and #11 was the highest up attacking player. #10 usually fell in the center of the attacking third, whether it be as a Center Forward, a Second Striker, or an Attacking Mid.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"The Brazilian relation to the no.10 is that it is usually the most important player, and the one who is entrusted with creating and dictating play. Brazilian's especially value the significance of the number because it was famously worn by Pele. Ever since whoever has worn it for Brazil has been seen as the best and most influential player (Ronaldinho, Kaka, Rivaldo, Zico, even for the Confed cup the no.10 was given to Neymar despite him using 11 for the last few years). 

In the European club context, it is looked upon with similar significance. Think Del Piero, Zidane, Platini, Maradona. These players defined their own roles somewhat, but what is key is that the no.10 is the hub of the team. They are the one who is given total freedom to roam and do what they want because that is what is necessary to get the best out of their game.

For Liverpool and Coutinho, he has been a playmaking no.10 (an attacking midfielder) rather than a trequartista. He starts from a loose central position 5/10 yards off the striker, from where he can roam to recieve the ball in space, dictate possession or look to run into gaps and find the forwards with through balls. Coutinho fits this role naturally; he knows when to play simple passes, when to penetrate with rapid acceleration and of course his delicious through balls.

true,newpathstohelicon,,Orkney Dark Island,"At the start of this year I'd been seeing a girl for about 6 months. We'd worked together a few years ago, then met again at a sort of reunion night out and gone from there. She turned out to be the most insecure person I've ever come across in my life. I'd generally spend 3 or 4 nights a week at her flat, and she'd spend just about every weekend at mine, but she was constantly harassing me for not spending enough time with her.

This came to a head over new year. I was in France on a skiing holiday with quite a lot of my family - this trip had been organised and paid for before we started seeing each other. She'd been complaining about how I wasn't going to be with her in Glasgow for Hogmanay, and I'd apologised, but at the same time I wasn't about to waste ~£700 by cancelling. I'd even offered to pay half if she wanted to come with us, but she refused because ""I don't know most of the people who are going"".

Anyway, it's January 1st, just after the bells, so I phone her to wish her a happy new year. Her mother answered the phone (quite a few stories about her mother, actually. Incredibly overbearing woman) saying that my girlfriend didn't want to speak to me as I had ""left her alone over the holidays"". She then told me that they'd been discussing what sort of holiday I was going to take my girlfriend on the following month (for her 30th birthday) to ""make up for it"". I hung up on her, and enjoyed the rest of my holiday.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"I just wanted to let you know I didn't downvote your post because I disagreed, but simply because it didn't make much sense.

Your explanation is: ""Suarez is going to Arsenal because he wanted to move at the beginning of the summer and Arsenal are the only ones who want him.""  That is simply false.  Clearly you missed that before Suarez made any remarks about wanting to leave, Real mentioned through the media, more than once, their interest in acquiring him.  I don't think Suarez was set on leaving Liverpool, only on going to Madrid.  I think he then thought it best to blame the media to save face with LFC and their fans.  Once Real realized they couldn't tap him up and get him at a steal, they forgot about him.  I think that through the Real tapping up he became more and resigned to leaving and now that Arsenal are the only ones involved, he'd be willing to leave, since he was set on it with Real, and thus has brought out the tried-and-true CL excuse.  To put it bluntly in the words of an American, Arsenal became his safety school--his back up plan.

And surely you see that Suarez's image is done for, right?  Especially if he stays in England.  With Real's image rights deals they stand to recoup a huge amount of money of Bale's fee, but Suarez's image is worth so little given his troubles.  And regardless of who he plays for the English media won't give him a fresh start.  That's delusional.  Not for any conniving reasons, just because they'll definitely remember everything he did in England--they covered it for god's sake.

Then you say that Liverpool categorically have no chance at competing for top 4--despite a very debatable equivalent squad to Arsenal and Tottenham as well as the ability to consistently perform as evidenced by the entire second half of last season.  You insist that Arsenal and Tottenham have too much money and will reinforce the squad too well for Liverpool to compete, but somehow *only for next season?*  You say Liverpool's days of being without the CL are dwindling, but how could that be if Arsenal and Tottenham are sure to reload their squads with exciting young stars?  Could it be that you are as deluded to think that Arsenal is going to instantly, with Spurs, become a title contender and knock City/Chelsea/United out of the top 4?  That's nonsense.

And these ""footballing, marketing and fiscal"" reasons for Liverpool losing Suarez are what?  They sound like reasons for Suarez to want to leave, but I assure you his desires, when they conflict with the success of the club, are not important.

That's the same internal rage-fest the writers of that page are feeling when they write it except their rage-fest is aimed at men, and in this case Moffat.

The key is they need everyone's internet to go through 1 central body, then if you want to find out what someone is up to, you don't have to go through the laborious process of getting permission from their ISP you can just use the firewall provider, which you have some ongoing agreement with. This has lots of benefits for the government, from GCHQ to piracy to kiddie porn.

They'll probably get a watered down version of the porn filter through, maybe it'll be opt in, or you choose when you sign up or something, really they don't care. All that really matters is that you have a situation where the government has access the details of what everyone is doing on the internet without having to rely on ISPs.

n.b. this doesn't necessarily mean any surveillance would be warrantless, it would just be far easier to implement.

You, amongst some others here, are more of the calibre I would have expected.

This subbreddit I have found to be a difficult place unless you are willing stay with the herd and not question any thinking. It has to be more of the 'oh yeh, aren't we great' kinda stuff. 

That was the point of this thread. To find out how a debate like this would go. I didn't find it very satisfying to say the least.

Maybe my tone was poor?
 I tried to be even handed but found getting insulted and downvoted while being reasonable hard to take in some cases.

Maybe I should have ignored.

No, it isn't conjecture; while not all kids with terrible parents will turn out to be criminals, many who are mistreated will. We educate kids whether their parents like it or not for this reason amongst others; we can't rely on the parents to be able or willing to teach their kids everything they need to know.

I don't really see the benefit of a new environment to get his image reshaped. The problem, from his perspective at least is the media, and its not like they're not gonna see him in London. Heck he's already at a team where he's the center-piece, once he comes back he just needs to show any reduction his total infarctions over the season to end it with his image restored.

As for a transfer request, that still doesn't give him a pass to leave, it simply asserts his intention to leave and relinquishes him of any loyalty bonuses. The club still has a right to seek a fair value on him, they are not obligated to sell. (eg Rooney from two seasons ago) The only reason Van Persie left was because he was close to running down his contract. It was a case of 22m today or 0m in 6 months, if the reports regarding his contract were true. He is worth a lot more than 22m and if he had a few more years left United would have to pay out a lot more than that.

Just for referencing sake the last time Van Persie announced he re-signed with Arsenal was 2009, Suarez last signed a ""long-term contract"" in August last year, meaning he has in all likelihood got one more season at the very least after this one.

Largely, I think you are correct. I too have seen well reasoned commentary downvoted for little or no good reason. Although I suffer from selection bias in that it is often me it is happening too xD. But I have been pleasantly surprised on occasion, I must admit, although this is becoming rarer. I really become disillusioned whenever the top comment is a stupid 1 liner on a relatively important issue. I do love it however, when there are a couple of posters replying with walls of text to each other on an issue in an otherwise abandoned thread - that always gives me hope as well as being stimulating.

I do think we are some way from becoming a true echo chamber, like absolutely atrocious subs such as r/scotland. I find if your opinion goes against the current grain, provided you go the extra mile to be polite and state you have no malicious intent, people will (only then) treat your comment with the same respect. Of course, your comment will unlikely receive the same upvoting because people seem to still think that the voting system is there to measure personal agreement rather than post quality. It is worse, that in many major subs there are actual monied interests gaming the system for their own ends.

I swear the system of left vs right and more abstract concepts of 'socialism, liberalism, anarchism, communism' etc are systematic ways of control, which as religion was for us before we could read/write or share information. 

Weirdly, people choose to categorise themselves this way, and I guess that's from feeling you have to fit in so have to categorise yourself otherwise you're open to attack.. due to some primal mechanism in our brains.

Here it's 'liberal', or left wing politics people buy into. Sitting on some moral high-ground, thinking anybody who questions or thinks differently is an outright moron. Self described 'progressive' politics because that line of thinking is obviously the way we, as a society are progressing. 

Muslims are cool but christians are stupid, the NHS must remain the same with no restructuring at all, gay rights is always important, trident is bad, women should be promoted more because theres no 50/50split in upper management of companies, we should borrow more and let the next generation get fucked by inflation, drivers should take theory tests so they take care of cyclists, but cyclists shouldn't do any tests, etc. 

These things are all progressive. 

Something I've come to understand in my life and actually have had my eyes opened up to this more because of reddit, is that people really do act like fucking sheep. 

Go out and look at people on the streets in your city centre or something. A group of goths walk past with black clothes and boots. A group of students walk past with tight jeans and converse. A group of chavs walk past with 110's and 3stripes. 

Even in the work place you get the same groups of people with the same attitudes/personality characterises together. 

People sharing the same opinions (such as liberalism) drowning out everybody else on reddit is the same side to this coin. Although I'd be surprised if the guardian, or some kind of extension of it, or perhaps a different organisation isnt actively targeting reddit to reinforce this same political rhetoric for reasons I don't understand. 

All in all, it's like a girl telling me another girl is fake because she's jealous she has bigger tits. I really don't give a fuck about what she's telling me, it's boring as fuck and no I don't agree that she's a bitch. 

I stopped commenting here long ago for these reasons, only having a quick scan now an then. It's not worth the constant boring rhetoric rehashed over current issues.

true,bankomate,null,null,"It is a strange feeling for me to think that next season I will not be a Liverpool player. For the past eight years, that is all I have known. The club, the staff, the city, the people and the supporters have played a massive part in my life. Liverpool is special in a way that only those who are lucky enough to experience the club close up can understand. It has given me memories that will live with me forever and friendships that will last just as long.  

But more than anything else, it has given me an understanding of what it is like to play for the most wonderful English club. I may not have won as many trophies and medals as I would have liked since joining in 2005 but the experiences I have been a part of are as important as any silverware. I now understand how supporters can lift a team and inspire them to do special things. I appreciate that there is something unique about Anfield and the atmosphere it creates. I believe that anything is possible no matter what the situation is because at Liverpool there is no such thing as a lost cause. And I have been humbled by the fight for justice for the 96 which showed me that the Liverpool people will always fight for what they believe in.  

I know that I have been blessed to be part of a Club like that and I hope that in return I have always given my best and represented Liverpool in the right way. There have been good times and bad times but no matter what the situation has been I hope that my passion has been clear. I have been asked what my favourite Liverpool moment was and if I had to pick one it wouldn’t be a save or winning a trophy. It would be my celebration against Manchester United when David Ngog scored a late goal. That is probably the quickest I have ever run in my life! It shows what playing for Liverpool meant to me and also that there was nothing better than winning a big game at Anfield. I used to look at the Kop when we scored those kind of goals in big games and I would be jealous of the supporters going crazy. If the closest I will get to that is running the length of the pitch and jumping on my team mates backs then that will do for me.  

Obviously, I won’t be able to do that next season but I hope that the supporters and my team mates will be able to enjoy many more moments like that. They deserve the best of times and it would give me so much pleasure to see Liverpool back where they belong, challenging for trophies and getting back into the top four. That was where the club was when I first arrived and although I am leaving a different club, one with new owners, a new manager, new players and new challenges, I honestly believe that Liverpool can reach those levels again.  

I am disappointed that I will not be part of that and although it was not my decision to leave I will accept it just like I have always accepted any decision that Liverpool have taken for me. They signed me, picked me, gave me some of the best experiences of my life and looked after me. If they feel that the best thing for me and for them is for me to go on loan to Napoli for a season then so be it. Napoli is a new challenge for me and I know that the fans are just as passionate about their team as the Liverpool fans, so I am really looking forward to playing for them this season and I will give my all.  

But if I have one regret, it is the way that I am leaving. It is only natural that I would be disappointed that the Liverpool management agreed to loan me to Napoli without telling me first, I thought that I deserved better than that even though I understand that difficult decisions have to be taken in football. A lot has been made about me informing the club that if an offer came in from Barcelona that I would have liked them to consider it. But I had also spoken to the club about the possibility of extending my contract if the offer was not made. I told the manager that I wanted to play for Liverpool and that Barcelona would only become an option for me if the opportunity arrived, like the rumours said it would, as it would be a chance for me to go back home. When it didn’t come I was happy to fight for my place so I was surprised that Liverpool decided it was in the club´s interests to send me to Napoli instead.  

None of this will change my feelings for the club or the people in any way and now I have to look forward to a new challenge with Rafa Benitez, who I consider to be the best manager I have worked with, and I am fortunate to be going from one great club to another. Napoli remind me in many ways of the Liverpool I found in 2005, in all the affection they have shown me on my arrival, in having an ambitious project, even in coinciding and working with Benitez again…This memory which in part unites me with you, makes me happy and feel very motivated to begin this new project.  

This is my chance to say thank you to everyone for everything that you have given to me and to my family. My children consider Liverpool to be their home and hopefully their love for the city and also for the club will only grow while we are away. I would have liked to have been able to say goodbye in a different way but because of the way the move came about this was not possible.
Maybe in the near future I can do it properly so that I can show my appreciation to you but all I would ask now is that you keep on inspiring the manager and the players just like you always have done and help Liverpool to become the club that you deserve once again. I would like nothing better than to come back at the end of my year away and for Liverpool to be back where they belong.  

Thank you for everything. Good luck. I will see you soon.

2. Valdes says he will leave Barca this season. Barca are expected to buy Pepe this year.
3. LFC buy Mignolet to replace Pepe once he leaves.  
4. Valdes changes his mind, says he will stay one more year. Barca are expected to buy Pepe next year.
5. LFC are stuck with 2 keepers, they chose Mignolet, get rid of Pepe's wages.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"People on Reddit, everywhere on Reddit, always use the downvote button as a ""disapprove"" button, rather than a ""irrelevant"" button.

No matter how much people complain that it isn't the technically correct usage, when most users see the up and down arrows, that is kind of instinctively what you would expect.

If the website designers don't want people to down-vote posts they don't like, they shouldn't have put the option there. They should have maybe put an extra option under the posts for ""irrelevant"" similar to ""report"".

Secondly, it isn't reasonable to expect every person on the internet to be able to distinguish between a comment that is objectively irrelevant and one that seems irrelevant to you.

If someone posts some long comment with a viewpoint where, to me, his knowledge is insufficient and his logic is flawed. Then from my point of view, he's misleading others with useless, incorrect information and his comment is therefore irrelevant.

We've all had unpopular opinions that cost us in Karma. Sometimes a really good counter argument came up and you can actually say, ""Huh, I didn't know that, my view point is now changed"" and you accept it. Sometimes you don't think any of the counter arguments are any good, so you feel hard done by, ""why don't these people understand??"".

Either way, these are just useless internet points. If people disagree with you, and you think they are misguided for it, does it really matter? Bear in mind that if your comment gets pushed down the thread, it doesn't get deleted. If someone wants to reply with a big counter argument, they can still do that. However, this isn't a formal forum of debate, you can't expect every user to want to do that.

In any case, /r/unitedkingdom is easily one of the biggest subs (relevant to people living in the UK) with the greatest cross section of political viewpoints. I usually find people with unpopular, *but well explained*, opinions always get extensive counter arguments presented to them, before they get downvoted to the bottom of the thread. The ones that don't are the kind of trollish posts that don't merit any counter argument because they don't present any arguments to counter!

If you find that your posts are getting downvoted without explanation, have you ever wondered if maybe the reason you don't see any ""good"" counter arguments is just because you aren't presenting any arguments that people can actually counter? Whiny rants like ""Tories suck"", or ""It was Labour's fault"", how do you counter that? Maybe you have been getting decent counter arguments, but you're too arrogant to admit it? If you're that unhappy about the downvotes even with all the counter arguments put forward, ask yourself, are you really looking for debate or are you just looking for validation of your opinions with upvotes?

Here's the test for you. I've now presented a dissenting argument to this thread and the majority of people voting in this thread.

This is less about spying and more about censorship and control of information on the internet.  The government believe that they have the right to determine what information should and shouldn't be made available to us, the people.  Information is power and they think they should have control over it and thereby, an element of control over us.

They're using pornography and the ""think of the children"" angle to sell it, but the goal is to implement a broad filtering system that allows them to turn off individual web site or large swathes of the internet at will.  In the short term, they want to be able to block access to sites like Pirate Bay without having to bother with all that annoying legal stuff like getting judges involved to determine if the law really is being broken and the ban warranted.

In the longer term, the censorship net could be widened to include all sorts of ""illegal material"".  They'll present a perfectly ""rational"" argument that people who don't break the law have nothing to fear, and that only criminals would support free access to illegal material.  Then everything rests on the definition of ""illegal material"".  No-one would notice a few changes to the law to broaden the definition of ""illegal material"" to include subversive (i.e. anti-government) material, incitement to unlawful assembly (what we used to call the right to peaceful protest), and so on.

It's the thin edge of a very dangerous wedge.

Actually it is a very good reason in principle. You could set up your system so CS staff cannot see the full password and have to prompt the customer for certain digits (e.g. ""tell me the first and third digit of your password""). Which is not possible without the plaintext passwords.    

I agree with some of the Twitter comments who are whining that the CS staff can see the *full* password on their screens. That should never be needed, even for a reset.

Sure it is:

Let's say you log in to your virginmedia.com account to update your password, your new password is ""secretpass1234"". The system has a pre-set number of ""verification"" combinations, eg: ""First and third letter"", ""First and last letter"", ""second and fourth letter"". The system prepares these combinations and encrypts them along side your password. You phone virgin media and they say ""Can I have your second and fourth letter please"", you provide them, they enter them into the system, the system compares the hash of those 2 letters against the hash of the pre-set ""Second and fourth"" hash that was generated upon the password change... done.

No plain text password storing needed.

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; Which is not possible without the plaintext passwords.    
&gt;&gt; Sure it is, it only takes a modicum of software engineering competence to do it properly:    

If you make a solution which can identify every letter in a password such that it can prompt and confirm it with a CS agent, then that system can also be used to reverse the password to plaintext.    

So you can make the system as complex as you wish, but ultimately it is just window dressing around plaintext.    

&gt; Let's say you log in to your virginmedia.com account to update your password, your new password is ""secretpass1234"". The system has a pre-set number of ""verification"" combinations, eg: ""First and third letter"", ""First and last letter"", ""second and fourth letter"". The system prepares these combinations and encrypts them along side your password. You phone virgin media and they say ""Can I have your second and fourth letter please"", you provide them, they enter them into the system, the system compares the hash of those 2 letters against the hash of the pre-set ""Second and fourth"" hash that was generated upon the password change... bam, done.   

So I have the first, second, third, fourth, and last letter of someone's password. Let's say the minimum is six digits as is standard.     

So I am a bad guy, I have stolen someone's cryptographic hash. I want to figure out what their password is from that, I have five of their six characters in their password, it would take me, even using the slowest currently available cryptographic hashing algorithm under a minute to determine the 6th character of their password.    

So in effect your compex ""security"" scheme has cost the bad guys between 1 and 3 additional minutes per account.    

Your point about hashing two characters is just idiotic, I'm not even going to explain why, it should be obvious.    

&gt; No plain text password storing needed. This is literally software engineering 101, seriously, anyone with more than half an hour programming experience could build out a secure system for password verification over the phone.    

I agree, someone who has taken programming 101 and who has half an hour of programming experience would build a system like that. A needlessly complex system to obscure plaintext passwords, while offering no actual measurable security over their usage.    

That's why you don't recruit junior programmers to build large complex systems.

Yes. Spurs missed out by one point, I believe that Sandro (who many had pegged as our player of the season until injury) is worth more than 1 point over 6 months.

There's the password I use for anything tied to money. Then the password I use for anything tied to personal information. Neither of those are used on any websites likely to be hacked, they aren't stored in plaintext anywhere, and nobody apart from me knows them. If these websites were compromised, it'd be on the news. I'm already ahead of about 90% of the population in terms of security.

After that, there are one or two passwords I use for everything else, for things I'm not as bothered about. They're used for mandatory registration on things like a cinema booking, free well-known web services, video game accounts, ordering pizza. Whatever. I wouldn't care if I had to tell a friend one of them for whatever reason. Most of the sites they're used on would send an email out if they found out their database had been compromised (see: ubisoft).

And then there's a blatant burner password. For when I'm probably not going to trust this site with my information but feel like signing up anyway. Voucher websites, very small personal/business websites. Usually accompanied by an email address designed for spam, spam and nothing but spam.

Fact is, even if my ISP password sits in the middle section, I wouldn't like a complete stranger being able to access it. In all likelihood they wouldn't be able to do any damage with it, but I'm not sure because I use that password for a lot of services. Because I *use* a lot of services.

Now Barca decide they don't need him so we get stuck with two excellent keepers fighting over one spot. I initially expected a Lloris-Friedel dynamic here but that was something else altogether, I mean Lloris was unhappy and linked with an exit like one month in, and it cost Friedel his consecutive app record. Reina has a lot to offer and Mignolet obviously needed game time to become more adjusted to his Sweeper-keeper role.

Then Napoli expresses an interest and Liverpool don't need to think twice. It's a big club, it's a CL club, its offering him first team footy and it's got an attractive (for him) coaching combo.

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"&gt; You're not reading what I've said, your eagerness to wave your big smart comp sci dick around is being done at the expense of your ability to read and comprehend. You don't literally hash 2 characters together, you do it using some form of salt (account specific, based on the password) as you would when hashing anything.     

It doesn't matter. The salt is known. Calculating every two character combination for a given salt is cryptographically child's play. A modern i5 could generate those combinations for A-Za-z0-9 is less than ten seconds. Ridiculous.    

&gt; If you still can't understand I can put together an example for you and I'll give you £100 if you can steal my password (I'll even use my reddit password) from it.    

I'm not sure what it is you're trying to gain here. Ultimately you either have plaintext or you don't have plaintext. If you don't have plaintext you cannot individually verify each character in a password, because whatever verification mechanism you make can be used to figure out a large chunk of the password (and hashing strength is largely dependant on length, which you've given up).    

Doing strange ""I'm going to hash two characters together"" stuff is just a pointless paper exercise. Calculating a two character hash in any algorithm is too fast for it to be secure.

true,Lord_Yaxley,scot-scottishborders,Jings Crivvens Help Ma Boab,"Unfortunately you find yourself at the bottom of an economic cycle.  Jobs are hard to find and the economy is poor.  However you have several things on your side; youth, no commitments, drive and an economic cycle that (hopefully) is moving beyond the difficulties of the past five years.

I found myself in a similar position at your age; I sold everything I owned (which amounted to around £3000), then flew to Melbourne on a working holiday visa.  You can make enough money living over there through labouring jobs to survive (I used to set up marquees and manufacture chain link fencing, basically jobs that are shit enough for the locals not to want - and there is ALWAYS a need for fruit pickers).  A few of my buddies got work at the F1, so got us all in to that for free as well.

If you are living in a good hostel (I can recommend Lords Lodge, in Prahran, Melbourne) it's an amazing lifestyle.  Lots of people to get to know, everyone is friendly, lots of nice laydees to get to know, and life is restricted to eating, socialising and working during the day.  All in gorgeous weather in one of the best cities in the world.  If you work hard enough you can club together with any mates you make and buy a shit car, then drive around Aus.   I met some of my best friends in Australia backpacking, and, I met my wife - ten years later we're happily married with two little boys!

I'm not saying run away from your problems, but perhaps a year out is what you need.  I hire people at my company, and someone who has been travelling will always be favoured over an otherwise equal candidate.  A lot of people I met travelling had similar stories to yourself and had just realised they were banging their head on a brick wall.

Aside from flying south to escape the economic winter, have you considered setting up your own business?  There are lots of grants and loans available for new starts.

I'd always consider the military as a last resort IF your dream hasn't been to join it.  It's not a commitment to take on lightly.  I do have a couple of mates who are fast jets pilots for the RAF.

Anyway so here is some code I wrote, it's super basic but it demonstrates the premise: 

https://gist.github.com/citricsquid/0927f4c1f64f0d735a8b

Set $password to the password (for example secretpass1234) and then do 

    php pass.php 0.1 se 

to verify if the 2 characters provided are valid.

https://gist.github.com/citricsquid/d68008a743995075f472

To test it, the 4th character is F and the 8th is R, so you can do:

    php pass.php 3.7 FR

to get:

    The provided characters have been validated!

I'm genuinely interested in if this can be cracked and if so please someone explain / demonstrate how... you know what a phone operator would know (3.7 = FR) and you have a copy of what would be stored in the database.

edit: terms of £100: provide a copy of code used and password, so that it proves it was a programmatic solution and not just guessing the password.

edit: also to clarify, you have to make use of the pre-set characters to crack the password, if you're just attacking the full password hash then you're not making any use of the pre-set keys which doesn't prove having them makes the password inherently insecure",0,1375095040,null,0,1375096459,0,cbchz8x,t3_1j9mv2,t1_cbchz8x,t1_cbchrc1,null,1430225635,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Personally I think we need to rethink the entire reason for parking fines. At the moment they are punitive tax generating fines.

I got a parking fine outside of my house because my wheel was like 3 inches beyond the line. Not blocking or obstructing anyone nor causing any problem. Yet I get fined? Why? Because the rules say so. Sorry but that's not good enough. I shouldn't have to pay £70 because of 3 inches of line. The worst part of it, those 3 inches were because a neighbor has a driveway. He doesn't have a car and doesn't use the drive. He is happy for me to park there. He came running out to tell me and by the time I got there the dick head had already given me a ticket.

We need to go back to giving out parking fines for those that obstruct roads, pavements or park dangerously. Not just because you went outside a fucking line by a few inches.

Just a few figures I found.... Massive increases in parking fine revenue.

10 was historically the inside left position, which is not really so different from Coutinho's role now. 

As tactics changed, so did the numbers. In Europe, where 4-4-2 became orthodox, the two forwards were 9 and 10. 9 remained the centre-forward and 10 was the partner in the more skilful mobile role.

In Brazil they went with 4-2-4 then 4-3-3, leading to 10 being the left-sided attacking midfielder — the most advanced of the three. 

So that leaves some confusion. A classic #10 can be a forward who drops off and provides for his partner or an attacking midfielder, depending on who is talking. 

In either case the role is to link midfield and attack. 

It looks like Rodgers wants to use Coutinho as a #10 in the Brazilian tradition, and that seems to tie in with how he sees himself as a player and he certainly has all the right ability.

If Pepe was willing to agree contract extensions I presume the club would have wanted to move him to one of the performance related contracts and so would be pushing for lower pay. The club informing Pepe of the possibility of being loaned out if we brought in a replacement and him not leaving might have opened the door for Pepe to bring forward that contract negotiation and take a hit in his wage for a year or so.

I don't really hold this ""wages"" argument anyway. We've massively reduced the wage bill in the last couple of years. Suarez earns a lot, but *only after* hitting certain targets (he reached £100k a week only after scoring 20 goals).

In the fourth year you stop giving a shit and the bank makes a £50m loss. They let you go, but as per your contract you are still owed that £3m bonus.

Top bankers aren't hired for their skills per se, but their network. Many of these top bankers could, if needed, pick up the phone and speak to George Osborne (or a close aide). That is worth its weight in gold to the bank, being able to influence and talk to top policy makers and so on and so forth.

Because of that they're extremely valuable to all the banks, and in the case that the bank is taken over / goes down the pan, they want reassurances that they will get their £5m bonus compensation that the other banks are offering them.

I'd definitely like a creative winger, someone similar to Lallana to give us another option, maybe more of a provider though. 

Defensively I can't decide, because we've got another couple of young wing backs in, and if they can both perform ok then I'm happy for them to be cover, especially as theoretically we can have cork cover right back and clyne swap to left if really necessary, something that having Wanyama in has freed up.

So all that said, a striker and winger/attacking mid who can be part of a decent rotation, then perhaps another defender just to alleviate some of the pressure on the players who may have to play in multiple positions at any given time if other cover isn't available.

This is not about changing peoples behaviors, this is about making money. I don't expect to be able to park wherever I want at my convenience, I just expect to be treated fairly and not being basically taxed to boost the councils yearly budget.

I find I can very easily keep the local council from making money from my parking.  I simply park where there are no restrictions, and walk to my destination.  Usually that takes no longer than five minutes.

&gt; Oh please fuck off. That is an idiotic generalization. Please tell me how getting a parking ticket whilst parked outside of my house makes me lazy? Or is it the simple fact of owning a car that makes me lazy?

You parked over the line.  You were too lazy to look and think ""hmmm, I'm not allowed to park over that line, I think I'll park elsewhere"".

&gt; Why block simulated rape in which all parties consent to it and there are records to prove it? Simulated rape is not illegal


The worry is that it will lead to more acceptance of violence against women. By permitting 'max hardcore' and similar it gives the false impression women are just tools to be used. Simulated rape may very well be illegal soon, and I'm not sure I'd feel bad about that.


&gt; Which in the case of surveillance and interception is completely and totally valid and provable through the growth of surveillance-related legislation introduced since the first labour term in 1997 ranging from the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act through to the Police and Justice Act etc.


No, slippery slopes are always fallacies, especially if you're trying to support them by linking to a *totally different government*.


&gt; The above is just a small selection of links from the wikipedia article on CCTV. There's a lot more here - sorry if that seems flippant (it's not intended) but I get about 139,000,000 results on that search although YMMV.

I asked for citations about their privacy being invaded, not references to false studies about how many CCTV cameras there are. You cannot have your privacy invaded by being observed in public. Unless you are about to ban me from looking at you while in public.


&gt; For the last link note the following comment from ""A herts police spokesman"":

    “The constabulary intends to continue using ANPR cameras, which deliver very substantial policing benefits, but also to ensure that its particular deployment of such cameras is – and is seen to be – fully justified. We look forward to working with the Commissioner to achieve those objectives.”

&gt; Note the use of is - and is seen to be. The image of justification is at least, if not more important than the act of justified use.

Utter nonsense! You just decided to put that spin on things when it exists nowhere else. You're seeping bias into everything.

&gt; it has long been known amongst people dealing with low level network traffic that data from point a to point b in the uk sometimes leaves the uk on it's way.

'We're all looking forward to the season, hopefully we can improve on last season – I'm sure with a few more additions to the squad we'll be a lot better.' 'It's just a matter of going out there and proving everyone we can.'

I did Bronze because it was just a bit more and they have a slightly earlier on-sale date (and I figured, if I ever move to London permanently, it couldn't hurt to have been on the waiting list for silver/gold), and I was able to get tickets to pretty much every major match (NLD, United, Chelsea). Just make sure that if you're trying to get tickets, go on to the ticket website about a half hour before they go on-sale--there's a queue system that starts up around then, and if you try and get on the site right at the on-sale time (usually 930AM in the UK iirc) then you might get shut out.

I'm also not sure pairings would have developed in a formal sense by then. Personally I think it's wrong to apply modern concepts to pre-history, at least try to as much as possible, so to label it 'pornography' is somewhat daft. However, I do think the figurines had a sexual meaning and purpose. I also think they had a religious purpose too. It's a complete guess but my own view is that, 35,000 years ago, the link between sex and reproduction had only just been figured out, and that therefore sex had been placed in a 'divine' realm as a giver of life, whereas previously it had been a base realm of satisfying natural urges (not much different to eating and shitting... of which we had no idea of the connection between nor it's connection to life). 

In this sense, pornography and religion were very much one and the same thing - in that sex was both watched and worshiped as part of what we would later label as a religious ceremony celebrating its divine nature as providing life. Some of the early Gnostic faiths in Egypt are also believed to have worshiped sex, so it's not such a far-out concept as it may seem.

Step 1 was ""block known child porn websites""

Step 2 was ""block torrent sites (for encouraging copyright infringement)""

Step 3 is now ""block all porn by default, allow people to turn it off""

It wouldn't surprise me at all if further steps included:

- Don't allow people to turn off blocking of ""illegal porn""

- Block access to websites with content about illegal matters (drugs, etc)

- Block access to ""extremist"" websites (could range from ""terrorist training manuals"" to later ""material contrary to the national interest"", depending on what people will tolerate)


- Block access to sites publishing leaked documents (wikileaks, the snowden stuff)

- Block access to ""extreme"" political parties (BNP, etc), because they're preaching hatred.

I always say the question should never be about hypothetical scenarios where the North and South did split, because thats always going to give people the idea that its a real possibility, even though the whole question is an excercise in theoretical sucession.

I don't have any family from the North, and I've spent most of my life either in Sussex or London, so I don't exactly know what the complaints up North are, yet I can say it isn't all fountains of gold bullion and grapevine-dangling concubines for us in the South-East either. 

I suppose the flags wouldn't matter, seeing as it isn't likely to create a whole other nation unto itself, because if every part of the country that felt they could do it solo started drawing up their own borders, then not only would the country crumble apart like a sand castle, but each seperate region would be skint within the year.

No seperate county can currently keep in the black by itself, and even the whole of Scotland I remain sceptical of in the long run. They'll have a hard time convincing businesses to ditch London and bring the costs of commerce down, which will throttle them unless they learn the magic trick to complete self-sustainance. 

But if they do split, then I expect they'll go for a quad flag (I don't really know all the fancy French terms for vexilology) with an emblem of the four major counties.

&gt;Can you explain, from the depths of your obviously superior soft, easy, wishy washy arts degree, how that is limiting my opportunities?

You are clearly arguing from the point of view of the dominant paradigm. Please don't assume I am in any way someone who has participated in the education system beyond that which is mandated by law? Your study has no bearing on anything. If it's something you like, good for you. It doesn't seem to help with your comprehension of society.

&gt;Any rate, get the last word in if you must, but remember the adage about winning a fight online being the same as getting a meal in the ""special' olympics.

Nope, no idea what you're talking about but I think you're very insecure if you think there is a fight going on. 

&gt;Sorry if you're averse to working hard. Personally, I enjoy it. I like having money I have earned myself. I like having cash in my bank account.

I am not averse to working hard if that's what someone wants to do but it's not a virtue and has no use to anyone per se. So those blokes in that David Niven film about a bridge in Burma were not glad to be accumulating virtue by working hard. They wanted to destroy their oppressors. Accepting the logic of your oppressor is understandable but not admirable. 

I have some money in my account and don't really give a shit about it as long as I can eat and pay rent. I do stuff for money on my own terms but I'm lucky. I wouldn't expect anyone else to gladly tolerate a shitty job for any reason.

&gt;And i really like knowing that I am going to do a degree that will put me on a paid work placement year, and allow me the chance to get a good job.

Haha. You have no idea what the future will bring except £30,000 worth of debt. Although you are apparently an obnoxious ignoramus, I would rather pay towards your education so you didn't start your life as a wage slave with a debt hanging over your head. 

&gt;Sorry your parents fucked up so much with you.

I don't think a science degree is going to help you with your insecurities. I hope making insulting comments about people helps.

It's up to the players themselves to have the foresight to make sure that once they retire they have options, players like Glen Johnson, Juan Mata and I'm sure many others are taking degrees so that when they are finished with football they have something to fall back on.

First, she was not widely read.  She is widely read *now* but her work wasn't even published till after she died and even then, it was considered ""ok but not great"".  No one bothered with it for at least 100 years.  I think people read her work today and *assume* it is/was:  Widely read back in the day AND factually accurate.

Sadly it was neither.

And that sort of flattens the case for her making an impact doesn't it?

As for her books having ""demonstrated how society had rendered women so dependent on men"", they were fictions that pertained only loosely to the lives of the top 1% of society - or rather, how that 1% might like to think they lived according to a single spinster.  Sort of like using I.T. crowd as a source on the lives of modern women managers.

And your comment (please don't take this personally...) sort of demonstrates this as well:  You like not to Jane Austin but to Jane Austin in Popular Culture.  The article itself has a picture worth 1000 words:  Jane sitting by a pool on her mobile.  And this is the Jane most people know and love and feel is important:  Jane in 2013, Jane like how I could be, dramatic, heroic, powerful Jane.

That Jane never existed.

There are 1001 female heros.  If you don't like Jane Goodall or Dorothy Hodgkin find someone else.  Margret Hodge is doing amazing work.  Emmeline Pankhurst actually achieved real change for women.  Elizabteths the 1 and 2nd are likely our greatest monarchs.

What I object to most is how many great women are being over looked for this cardboard cutout of a person, neither great in her own right nor real in pop cultures portrayal!

I am glad I am not a great women (I am neither).  If I were and Jane Austin was being held up as a model for girls, I would be insulted!

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I think of it a bit like your average university debating society, or at least what I assume it is like based on my university. Both sides make their arguments and counter arguments. There is no ""judge"" who declares one side a winner or loser. However, at the end, the entire audience votes depending on which side they think made the better arguments. So by this method, someone ""wins"" but at the end of the day, the result doesn't matter. It was the actual debate that mattered. On Reddit, you and I are the debaters, and the voting users are the audience.

In most important arguments about politics or religion for example, people generally will already have made their minds up. These are the kinds of issues that normally end up looking one sided on /r/unitedkingdom just because of the demographics here. It is very, very difficult for people's opinion to change on such basic beliefs. So when you put forward an argument in a debate, or on Reddit, you shouldn't really expect to change many, if any minds at all. You may be voted up or down depending on what other people believe in, but that doesn't really say anything about the quality of your arguments, simply that they disagree with them.

If you are truly in it for the debate, and not the upvotes, then your net karma income from the exchange should not matter, because it has no bearing or relevance to the quality of the debate. Think of it as that meaningless vote at the end of a formal debate. All it does it tell you what the particular audience you are preaching to thinks. What *should* matter to you is engaging another debater in an interesting exchange. I happen to be pretty left-wing liberal, so fortunately for me, my views generally align with the audience here. But when I make a big post like this one, I just enjoy putting my two cents down in writing. After I hit submit, I don't really care if it gets upvoted or downvoted (well...I guess I care a *bit*), I probably won't ever come back to look at it. *Unless* I get a reply. *Then* it gets interesting. And that's what makes it all worthwhile.

My point, that I am struggling to make succinctly (which is why I have never been on a debate team), is that if you want to engage in meaningful debate, then your pay-off won't be in karma or votes or wide approval. Your pay-off will be entirely in the action of debating itself.

The problem is that whilst the wealthy still live further South, unless they're living off shares in stocks or just happen to be one of the select few who gets payed a small fortune to do jobs like run a hospital or army or something, then their businesses will be producing their goods out of the Midlands. 

The textiles mills are all but gone, the mines are shut, and the bulk of shipping now gets fed through felixstowe or Leith, so by cutting off from the rest of the country - because lets face it, it isn't just North v South as cutting off from London would mean placing constraints on all the other regions as well.

Maybe your basic needs are less than most people's?  I'm thinking about being able to enjoy an average existence, being able to meet all your usual expenses and socialise reasonably.  Nothing fancy, but not bare subsistence, to be a human being who can fully participate in their society - the kind of lifestyle the median person in the UK enjoys today say.  Now, in the world, that still means an incredibly privileged existence, but let's keep this simple.

&gt;No it's what ONE guy called Dan Pink tells us, who is an author, and last worked in 1997 as a speech writer. He now sells ""motivation aids"" from his website, like some new age guru telling us we don't NEED a lot of money, while charging $27 per book. Science, my ass ! 

Massive ad hominem.  In any event, the two seminal studies he quotes are both prototypical examples of very mainstream, much replicated science, widely referenced and published in high quality peer-reviewed journals.

&gt;A society where everything is 100% automated, and everyone is well fed, relaxed and contented, will self-implode in an orgy of overpopulation until all the earths natural resources are exhausted.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"You ranted against the categorisation of people's ideologies and yet you have managed to categorically dismiss all ""liberals"" by painting them all with a single brush.

People categorise themselves because people need order and patterns in their lives. We all recognise that there will probably never be two people who completely agree on everything. But we figure out the things most important to us and find people who feel the same way to interact with. It is primal, and also benefits us as a society, since we cannot fight a battle for every single thing we don't agree with.

I don't know where you got those terrible generalisations of ""progressive"" policies. I agree with some, but not all. They have nothing to do with each other. Is that how you think it works to be ""progressive""? Do I have to agree with all of them to agree with one of them? You're like a politician trying to make a reasonable proposal sound ridiculous by grouping it with a bunch of ridiculous proposals and presenting them like they must naturally go together.

If people look alike or dress alike, are they not allowed to then have differing beliefs or opinions? A goth likes wearing dark clothes and listening to certain music, so what? What does his dress sense have anything to do with his beliefs? Furthermore, there are only a finite number of clothing styles it is possible for a person to wear. Unless you make your own, uniquely styled clothes, you will always look like someone else out there. Perhaps you shouldn't be so quick to judge people based on their appearance.

In the workplace, people need to work, and that means getting along with each other. It is only natural that people over time temper their personality to adhere to workplace professionalism. If we allowed all of the spiky parts of our individual personalities to come out fully in work, we'd never get any work done.

Reddit has a democratic-like voting system. In democracy, the majority rules, the minority gets drowned out. In Reddit, all that means is that your post goes further down the list when ordered by top/best. It's not being censored or deleted. People can still read it and reply to it. The only downside is that you're not getting meaningless internet points. Frankly, if that's all you care about, then you're free to leave and find a better choir to preach to. /r/unitedkingdom doesn't need people saying, ""Tory sux"" but it also doesn't need people saying, ""liberals sux"" or ""progressives sux"" or ""you're all fucking liberals"". Neither side is adding anything to the discussion.

The story takes place in Nazi-Occupied France in the lead up to D-Day, where the emergence of new and terrifying weaponry among the German ranks has both the British forces and French civilians anxious and disturbed.  

Lost in war-torn Europe and deep behind enemy lines, John Smith must gain the trust of the Allied undercover troops and expose an alien conspiracy that threatens not only the outcome of the Second World War, but the survival of the entire human race.

true,00DEADBEEF,cnty-uk,The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"&gt; This idea seems flawed. Its only going to discourage low earners like those in retail and fast food simply because if your out of a job the cost of placing a claim is a massive chunk of what ever little money you will have gotten from your last pay.

Not just low-earners. I was a high earner and was about to make an ET  claim (but didn't because it was settled through Acas). A part of that claim would have been for unpaid wages. These wages would have more than covered the fees. So I can see a future when people owed money by their employers can't claim, simply because their employers owe them money. It's ridiculous.

So despite my higher income, I wouldn't have been able to afford to claim in the new system, because I never received my final pay.

&gt; I also didn't see anything about possibly claiming back the fee from the other party so for example if I was missing £200 from my pay check at my min wage job I'd actually be out of pocket should I try and claim it back.

My plan was if Acas conciliation failed to submit my claim before today, thus avoiding the fees, but Acas did advise me these fees would be recoverable from the Respondent after a successful claim.

And they add more and more all the time... and surprise surprise they are making more and more money. If following the rules was so easy they wouldn't be making so much money.

It's so easy to sit there and say it's the motorists fault and clearly lots of people believe this, and yes that might be the case in many cases but I'm afraid that is no excuse for how councils have been treating motorists. As cash cows.

Many councils are making millions and millions a year in parking files. And it's not that drivers are getting worse, it's that the rules and enforcement areas are getting tighter and tighter and subsequently so are the profits.

Example, Waltham Forest doubled it's revenue from 2011, to 2012. Up from 1.5m to 3m. I'm sorry but a 100% increase in revenue is not explained by your assertion that the trick is to follow the rules.

Her work was not meant to be a documentary, it was fiction set in her time.

I don't see how her no longer being alive negates the influence of her work. Culture builds on the culture that existed before it.

Again, her work was not written to be completely accurate, but women were not treated equally and in she wrote showing how the only means women had to improve their standard of living was to marry.

I linked to Jane Austen in popular culture because the point I'm making is that she has had a big influence, which you kind of just dismissed with ""she didn't get popular in her lifetime, so she can't have been influential""

I agree that there are plenty of influential women to choose from and there is no way to measure who is 'best', but Jane Austen is a fine choice. I can't fathom how you can claim she's not great in her own right given the popularity of her stories, loved by the world and academically acclaimed.

Birmingham: 1.074

Sheffield: 0.552

Bradford: 0.523

County Durham: 0.513

Manchester: 0.503

Liverpool: 0.466

**North total: 5.511**

**London: 8.308 (2012)**

**London wins by a lot!**

But of course it's not easy to say exactly what counts as ""in the city"". For example, Greater Manchester has a population of 2.685m even though Manchester has a population of only 0.503m. And ""Inner London"" has a population of only 3.232m.

What if we take top 5 Counties instead (which are each of vaguely similar size to Greater London)?

West Midlands: 2.740

Greater Manchester: 2.685

West Yorkshire: 2.227

Lancashire: 1.461

Merseyside: 1.381

**North total: 10.493**

**Greater London: 8.197 (2011)**

**North wins!**

Obviously, it all depends on your definition of the city limits and how many cities you include. But I guess we can all at least agree that London has a shit load of people.

EDIT: /u/OccasionalPopCulture used another wiki source based on ""urban built-up areas"". Since I'm avoiding work, let's compare London built-up area to the top 5 Northern built-up areas! *Note that these are ""built-up areas"", not entire counties, and may be bigger or smaller than the county proper.*

http://www.redandwhitekop.com/forum/index.php?topic=307486.msg11862014#msg11862014

&gt;In order for the loan deal to happen in the first place, a few events have to have occurred:
&gt;
&gt;1) Napoli had to instigate the offer. Which means Rafa had to instigate it. 
&gt;
&gt;2) If Rafa and Reina do, indeed, share the same agent, then there is no way that Reina didn't know about it.
&gt;
&gt;3) The clubs would have negotiated their sides at the board level. Very rarely are players a party to that.
&gt;
&gt;4) Once that side had been agreed, Rodgers/Ayre would have informed Reina that Napoli have been in for him for a loan deal, and that they think the terms are acceptable, and he's free to talk to them if he wishes.
&gt;
&gt;5) In order for Reina to move to Napoli, he had to have accepted the loan himself. He would have had to have the desire to accept personal terms from Napoli. He had the option to refuse personal terms, stay, and fight for his place.
&gt;
&gt;6) As soon as the club level negotiations were done, Reina's agent - not Reina himself - would have been notified. So none of this should really have been a surprise to him. I think he might have been surprised that Rodgers was willing to let him go, and maybe he feels a bit unwanted. But there was no way he got a call one morning to hear someone on the other end saying ""we've loaned you to Napoli - thanks and good luck"". It doesn't work that way. 
&gt;
&gt;7) I don't think that the ""Rafa is the best coach I've ever worked with"" part of his letter is a dig at Rodgers. In fact, I think it supports my contention that he felt unwanted by the club. By having his favourite coach come in for him, he doesn't feel as rejected (because by all accounts he's an emotional bloke), and he feels like he is ""wanted"" by Napoli - so of course he would be generous in his praise of his new (old) manager. 
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, it seems that some supporter's daggers for Rodgers and for the club are never sheathed completely. It's a shame, because Rodgers has continually displayed the pragmatism that was so demanded of him earlier on. Reina was a great servant to the club, and I certainly wish him all the luck in the world. But he's been in professional football long enough. This is the way of things. He wanted to go to Barca, so Rodgers got his replacement. His wages didn't fit a bench player, so he had to be moved on. That's the reality of the game, and always has been. It reminds me of a story Alan Ball used to tell about when he moved to Arsenal from Everton. He was called into Catterick's office, and Catterick said to him ""We've had an offer from Arsenal, and we're going to take it. It's good money for us, and you've given us 5 good years, but it's time for a change"".  Ball, if I recall correctly, was disappointed, but saw the sense in it. It wasn't the ending he would have liked, but it was the logical step for the club. That was in 1971. 32 years later, the same ruthless pragmatism still exists, at all levels of the game. It's great to be emotional about players and want fairytale endings for every player, but the cold hard reality is that players are chattel to the clubs; when it's time to move on, it's time to move on. Sentiment doesn't come into it. If the club aren't ruthless, they will fall further behind. 
&gt;
&gt;Best of luck to Pepe - and I hope he has many a clean sheet in Serie A and the Champions League.

true,dandolinho,lfcflame,,":) I am resigned to the idea of him going, but that's not the reason I'm ok with it. I'm as sure as you are that our season would ha e been as flat as fulhams without him there last season. For a large part we had just Luis on the books as a striker, without him, we would ha e been strikerless. Non the less, I stand by my reasoning that as a team, we won't fare as bad as the ney-sayers would have you believe. I appreciate his standing in global football, I appreciate at times he carried us last season, especially early on until coutinho and sturridge joined, but I genuinely think we will be just fine without him. Suarez is not a Rodgers player, his ball retention, granted at the expense of some sublime pieces of skill, leaves a lot to be desired. We may score a few less, but we won't be turned over quite as often, possession is key to Rodgers style.

That is not to say I'm right, or your wrong. It's a personal opinion on a style of play that I don't think he fits into. I'm not mad or deluded, I have a clear idea how I think the team will work and play, and I find suarez's inclusion detrimental to that flow on the whole. Sure there are matches he has made a difference, and I celebrated every goal, but equally I bemoaned his selfishness (and I say that while acknowledging strikers tend to be fairly greedy). Players in better positions, too eager to go to ground.

I'm not saying come the start of the season and he is still there that I will give up on football, that I won't watch us while he plays, no. But nor will I denounce anyone who thinks that we are fucked if he goes. Personally I hope your wrong and we do fine, because as you say, its almost certain he is on his way out, and with that in mind, its probably best to be a little more optimistic than pessimistic, could be worse :)",0,1375119069,null,0,false,0,cbcok41,t3_1ja4we,t1_cbcok41,t1_cbcnznj,null,1430123785,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

What I did, was study up on web development like the poster above suggested. I do some music stuff on the side, play bass, record myself occasionally.

But off the back of that you could pay if you then wanted to message people. I didn't ever do that but I had messages from quite a few fellas. 

- Many, many players

- Met a guy who used to DJ near my work and used to say hello to him when he was DJing in the bar nearby on Fridays; good sort, think he invited me to a few parties but I never made it; would happily meet him again, but only on a friends basis. Should drop him a text to see how he's doing actually. 

- Month long thing with a guy that fizzled out; I think we both realised we weren't really compatible and so just stopped contacting one another. Still in touch with him on Facebook and get invited to the odd party or gig now and then. Never unfriendly to him but haven't made it to any of them. His people aren't really my people. Far too scene for me.

- Six month relationship. Can't say a bad word about him, he's one of life's lovely people, just wasn't right for me. 

- Someone who made me laugh lots who was destined to become a lifelong friend. Spent a lot of time having fun with him, his friends, his ex girlfriend who then became his wife, and he was amazing. He died of a brain tumour a few years ago. I've never seen so many people at a funeral before, nor cried so hard. 31 years old is no age to die. 

- Some mad sort was so infuriated that I wouldn't meet him (he tried, oh my god he tried so hard and for so long) that on Valentine's day one year he created a false email account and emailed me a photograph of a hive of wasps in the shape of a heart. 

- Someone I liked a lot but who was in a complicated relationship split and still living with his ex gf. We had an *amazing* night out, I can't remember the last time my tummy hurt so much from laughing, and I nearly broke my leg on the date. He was nursing a lump the size of an orange with a bag of peas at 5am. Anyway, he was messed up, kind of had to leave him to it. 

- As above, but turned out to have a wife and three kids! 

Feedback from friends who do it these days is mixed. Male friend in his mid 20s with pretty low self esteem gets down because he only gets a reply from one in ten. Female friend in her early 40s is constantly out on dates with all sorts, many of whom seem completely unsuitable. 

Only piece of advice I can give is to chat to them for quite a while before you agree to meet. I probably drove them mad by doing so but I absolutely would not meet up without chatting for a month or so or until I felt completely comfortable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As explained before, if you get downvoted in a subreddit such as this one, your comments are timed at set intervals. There are two possible reasons for this;

1. This system may innocently be in place to account for unmoderation, so spammers/trolls cannot spam the whole website lowering the quality and content of the comment section in particular. 

2. As obvious as it is that 'reddiquette' is NOT adhered to because you constantly see differing opinions to that of the 'hivemind' downvoted, even in this sub.. It also effectively serves as a censoring tool. If you get 6comments as a reply to a downvoted comment (or opinion) and are forced to wait 10minutes inbetween comments, that's 1hr it'll take you to reply further simply justifying your opinion.

Because of the effective 'forced silencing' of people with differing viewpoints, it's not really a democratic website at all. It's like a police officer holding your mouth closed in the pub and partly why I just can't be arsed with writing serious comments here or reading it as often any more.

Fully addressing your comment would result in addressing the specifics of liberalism with you, which I don't want to do with you or anybody else in an effort to show who has the greater understanding of ideologies and thus, a more informed opinion. Or basically presenting a better argument, which is like the nerd version of lifting heavier weights than your mate in the gym. 

To me, ideologies, be them religious or political are things I simply do not care about, it isn't enjoyable to read about and debate, it's about as relevant to anything as the story line of corrie is. Ideologies are just tools that blind people so that the proper leaders in the world can get on with leading. 

I'm aware some people such as yourself will be offended and I don't mean to offend anybody but being quiet because you might offend somebody is cowardice. People live, fight and die for ideologies and to me it's all just pointless. 

Highlights the beauty of science and pure knowledge really, and how full of bollocks and verbal tap dancing politics is. 

It'll drive anybody insane if they think about it too much on an ideological level, you'll just fall deeper into the abyss of categorisation and abstract philosophies to define why you think what you think, when in reality they're as influenced by your environment and impulses as your political opinion would be without ideology.

But then you'll have to go back in a week because although they had it working in the hospital as soon as you went to sleep and woke up it wasn't working because the software in your hip isn't compatable and looses the settings when you reboot.

 But that's fine you can just upgrade to the latest HipOS 7 and your foot will work better than ever. For that though you'll need a new spine and a leg upgrade (and we might as well upgrade the other leg whilst we're at it otherwise it would just look silly) to 'harness the full potential' of the OS. Oh and not to mention new balance sensors and they'll throw in a free pair of shoelaces (£20 installation fee). And you're reluctant at first but the charismatic ~~salesdrone~~ 'experience technician' convinces you to have it all done, and whilst you're at it you sign up for thier master~~plan~~care package for all the benefits it brings and you can always cancel it within 14 days if you're not happy, and for that they'll give you some discounts on the other things. 

So you go away all smiles, but you're back in a few days because nothing is working and you're blacking out all the time and throwing up and just don't feel right so they have a look at you and although they've upgraded your system as far as they can the heart and lungs are just too oldschool to cope with all the upgrades, they'd have to strip out everything and put a whole new system, but you could keep the case. 

You ask for your old legs back... just chop off the toe and be done with it, but it's too late, they've thrown your old parts away, but you're broke and your whole body is worse now than when you first came in, you're screwed. Can I cancel the mastercare agreement at least, it's useless anyway? 'no' comes the sombre reply, because technically you only got certain discounts because you took the plan and if you cancel it you'd have to pay for them in full, so you'd end up paying more. You have nothing left, you break down screaming and crying on the sales floor, your legs fall off. Eventually the police come and drag you out of the store.

 We originally had an agreement with Schalke to purchase Holtby this summer because he had &lt;6 months left on his contract. For one reason or another, they decided to let us have him early (january) for a reasonable price, so we agreed and got him 6 months early for 2m. There's a lot of back story involving formations and AVB and backroom politics that i'll try not to bore you with, but all the signs point to AVB having a plan to switch to a 4-3-3 formation this summer (we actually already have, as of our first preseason games) from the 4-2-3-1 that we were using last season. It is my belief that Holtby was originally planned to be brought in this summer to be our starting CM in the 4-3-3 when we switched. Since he was brought in early last season, and we were still using a 4-2-3-1 which saw Bale in the middle, Holtby had no chance of getting game time simply because his intended position didn't even exist yet, and the position he could've played had Bale occupying it. The fact hes not raised a stink and there's been absolutely nothing in the press (that i've seen) about his potential transfer away makes me believe he has some assurances from AVB that he will be kept on and given some playing time, which gives credence to my theory that he was brought in for this summers formation change. He might not have gotten much playing time this past season but I think he's very much so in our teams plans, so i can't see him going.

So they have to pay you at least minimum wage.

If it's not in the contract as such, then you have them on breach of contract.  If it _is_, then that's still against the law.

Either way, they are in the wrong.

Actually getting restitution for that is, however, tricky.  You might have to burn bridges to do it, depending on how obnoxious they want to be.

The first step is to speak to them directly over this point (either breach of contract, or minimum wage law), and then if no joy, consider legal recourse.  I'm afraid I've no good advice beyond suggesting CAB, or small claims court, at that point.

I do note that the current minimum wage law requires it to be deliberate on the part of the employer, for it to be a criminal offence.  If it's written into the contract, then it is clearly intentional and deliberate - and I do note that the government is clearly wanting to show that they are tough on minimum wage rules; so if that is the case, consider talking to your MP (particularly if they are LibDem/Tory), as they might want to make hay on it.

**DOMESTIC:** Assuming we make it through the the group stage of the Europa League, I wouldn't expect us to hit the heights of last year domestically. While I think West Brom will be a weaker side this year, Southampton and Norwich look particularly stronger than last season, and I don't think any other teams who finished above us will fail to do so again (although with Everton, one can hope). I *do* think we've got our strongest ever squad right now, although unless we sign another striker (better than Moore and Lita at least), what with Europe and all I wouldn't expect any great cup runs due to that single position. Bony and Michu won't be able to play in them all, after all.

In short, I think I'd be happy with a finish 13th or higher in the league, and while I would like us to win another cup, I don't expect us to get very far in them this year.

**EUROPE:** I'm almost scared to make predictions here, as I don't want to tempt fate with our Swedish opposition who are nobody's mugs. I think we're good enough to get to the group stage, but we'll need to play well these next two weeks and hope for a kind draw to make sure. I think if we get to the group stage, we will be on the fringe of getting through to the knockout rounds, but I wouldn't expect it to be close to easy.

**PLAYERS:** As touched upon earlier, I think we need another striker, and I expect we'll get one, possibly on loan. While many people are  excited about the singing on Bony (which was undeniably much needed), personally, I'm most excited about Shelvey. The lad has looked unreal in preseason, and even though his last season with Liverpool wasn't brilliant, I'm hoping that he gels better with our style and players, and I *think* he could well be our player of the season.

I expect this to be Britton's last big season, so I'm hoping for a few stormers from him before we have to come to terms with him either moving on or becoming a backup player as Ki and Shelvey take over. For now though, I think he's more than capable of having a great season.

In terms of a starting XI, I have no concerns with any position on the pitch. Get another striker in (and a centreback if Williams leaves), and we're absolutely golden, in my opinion.",0,1375125273,null,0,false,0,cbcr2z7,t3_1jalyo,t1_cbcr2z7,t3_1jalyo,null,1430122471,6,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,6

**1)**  The first is to learn basic typography and design skills, then put that to use by building static html/css sites. From there you look for junior front end jobs and work up. You'll likely have an opportunity to cross over into some back end dev work from there.

**2)** As likely_controversial another route into a back end dev job is to start at first line support. For this route you'll likely want to follow a programming course of some sort.

For both options, **your employment will be made on the strength of your portfolio**.

* For option 1 that will be a small portfolio site with a few examples of other sites you've built. These don't need to be full on contracted site builds. ""I like this band, so I remade their site for fun"" is fine. 

* For option 2 it will likely be a github profile, with examples of a few little programs you've coded.

Option 1 worked for me. Initially I planned to become a full time designer, but I was dishearteningly mediocre at it.

In my opinion, option 2 is more difficult. There is a steeper learning curve into the techy side of things and it's a little harder to blag that stuff in an interview ;)

**Now, where should you go to learn this stuff?** /r/webdev /r/learnprogramming /r/web_design all have their moments.

I'm a massive fan of [nettuts @ tutplus.com](http://net.tutsplus.com/). Their premium courses are great, well worth the cost of a monthly membership. You can download all the vids from the site during your first month, cancel your membership, and watch them at your leisure.

This is me 17 years ago at Alder Hey. Owen is only 18 here, and despite what everyone thinks of him now, I'll always love the guy. A paediatric cancer ward is literally like death, all the kids looked fucked up, but he didn't flinch or act weird at all. I got a hug and he sat down and chatted for about 10 minutes. An absolute hero. He was the first one in and the last to leave. For an 18 year old to behave in such a manner really is so commendable.

As you can see, I am fucking speechless. He walked into my room unannounced, as I had no idea that the team were coming. I swear I thought I was dreaming. I managed to get a few words out but in my head all that was going through was ""IT'S FUCKING MICHAEL OWEN AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!""

I hate the conservatives just like everyone else, but I really hope this subreddit doesn't descend into a facebook-esque captioned photo type political commentary.

People are raising hell over the current load of cuts.  It would be an all out revolution if  institutions like the NHS or JSA were to be actually culled like the poster purports. 

Don't forget, the conservative core voters aren't just millionaires who are self-sufficient and don't want to pay taxes. It is also the broadly middle-aged-middle-class who have been paying into the system their entire life. Some of them may believe that it needs cutting, but they aren't going to completely abandon something they've been giving half their paycheck to for decades.

Programming isn't simple to pick up. Python is an excellent language to start with, but acquiring enough skills to pay the bills is a long process. You said you have a music-related degree. My first thought is: look for producing sound effects and music for games and film shorts. Release some of your work on soundcloud. The most important is not to be inactive.

Find a temporary job; one that won't take up all your time. That last part is important: taking a job that just exhausts you out would just delay the moment you run out of money and not leave you free to look for other options.

Moving around europe is something I've done a lot and while it's an interesting experience, it's not something you should try without having a cash reserve AND a backup plan (parent's home, for example).

Save money. Big rules: Don't smoke or drink. Cook your own food rather than eat out. Buy in bulk, asda is good. For moving around, biking &gt; public transports &gt; driving (forget the driver's license until you have a lot more money, honestly).
Even if you feel you have enough money, saving up is always a good idea. And never, ever get a loan if you can avoid it (no credit cards!).

Your depression needs to be taken care of. If you find a few things to do (not just a job routine), it will already improve a lot. Try to get a social life — in your situation, I would say picking up a sport (or a cheap gym) would be an excellent start.

**You need to go for smaller companies**. They get nowhere near the same amount of applications as big/famous corporations so they're much less likely to start their recruitment process by cutting off people below a 2:1.

Computing jobs in smaller companies are also massively beneficial to your ability to get hands-on. There is much less red-tape in comparison to corporations and as you'll make up a large percentage of a network/IT team, you're more likely to be tasked with wider ranging tasks that will help you learn and develop skills you may not know you even enjoyed/were good at. Plus it'll make you more employable when you say you covered loads of different things rather than joining a corporation where you're much more likely to get pigeon holed into a super specific role.

I'd say that going for graduate schemes is a dead end with a 2:2 unless you find the rare one that does accept them.

While you may lose some parts of your game as you get older, such as speed, stamina, and strength, his vision and technique are attributes that could continue his career for another 5 or 6 years easily. I think the days of lung-bursting runs from deep midfield to get on the end of a cross or through ball may be almost over (albeit not quite yet, see preseason goal from Allen's pass) but his ability to hit a 60-70 yard ball on a dime to a teammates foot won't diminish for a long time. Paul Scholes could still be playing at the top level in that deep-lying distributor role if he had the motivation to continue his career, even if it wouldn't be every game. 

Gerrard for me will play into his late thirties, his ability to unlock a defense with a beautiful ball from his own half is practically unparalleled in the premier league and I don't see him losing that for awhile. 

I feel like I'll get downvoted into oblivion and I'm not saying this because Gerrard was the sole reason I became a Liverpool fan in the first place, but because his professionalism, quality, and vision in that combination are key to playing deep into your thirties.

I'm originally from New Jersey, so the spray tanned comment really hits home.

I looked up all the pubs you guys recommended so far...they look great.  We're all into craft beer.  I'm very into Scotch, which I now know to just call whiskey.  I'd love some good Whiskey pubs to take my buddies to in order to expose them to the stuff a bit more.

On that note, would it be at all worthwhile to drive out to/ferry over to the Islay distilleries (Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Ardbeg, Bunnahabhain)?  I wish I had more time to get up to Talisker and see more of the country.  What are some that maybe we American's aren't accustomed to and should try?  I generally like all types of whiskey.

If you have the whole password, you can compare the hashes - but not if you have part of the password. In fact you'd need to store a hash of every possible combination of characters - which could be a lot.

It certainly shouldn't be displayed to the agent, but the best implementation to me seems to be storing the password with a reversible encryption, with the key stored in-memory and comparing 3 random characters with the password. This slightly increases risk at the company's end (an engineer might be able to be decrypt passwords at will, agents might be able to copy the key but would still have to access the database), but there's good security at the customer's end (can't overhear the full password).

Alternatively requesting the full password and performing a case-insensitive hash check would tighten security at the provider, but you get a higher risk of someone hearing the password at the customer's end.

true,Return_of_the_Native,wiltshire,Wiltshire &amp; Cambridge,"/r/unitedkingdom is, generally speaking, a left leaning liberal minded subreddit and with a considerable interest in politics. Look back through the sub to catch up with current info (most of it will be from the Guardian I imagine). 

Keep an eye on the papers. The Guardian and Independent might match up best with your ideas, but that's all the more reason to have a look at papers like the Times and the Telegraph too. Make sure you're sitting down comfortably before opening the Sun or the Mail or the Mirror. Preferably on a toilet because then at least you'll be able to find a use for them. Satirical outlets like the Private Eye are fantastic at keeping their finger on the pulse and providing a no-nonsense view of the situation. I'd highly recommend a subscription.

Bear in mind (I have no idea how long you've lived in the US) that 'left leaning liberal minded' means a very different thing here than it does in the US. 

[This will acquaint you with the last general election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010) - and if you're not familiar with the [structure of the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom), have a look.

Roam around find out what you're particularly interested in. Big issues here over the last few years have been (this is by no means a complete list):

 * The economy/recession. Huge public distrust/anger at bankers for perceived reckless greed, apparent lack of government response to this. Extensive and (in places) brutal spending cuts to public services. General economic hardship, lack of jobs, redundancies which don't seem to have had much positive impact. There's been a [small - 0.6% - resurgence in the GDP](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23446056) but it's not a huge change and ordinary folk won't feel it.

 * The coalition and its struggle between the rightish-wing conservatives (Tories) and the liberalish Lib Dems. And (subjective opinion alert) the resultant Lib Dem surrender of key policies and integrity. And any chance of a decent election result for years to come.

 * The increase in student loans

 * Increasing privatisation

 * [the expenses scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal)

 * Foreign policy (particularly in relation to the Arab spring, Libya and now Syria). Also in relation to America.

 * Gay rights. Gay marriage was recently legalised in the UK.

 * Further-right parties like UKIP and the BNP (as well as linked groups like the EDL) continue to have minor support but little to no real power. They don't hold any MP seats.

Others may disagree but the general public opinion is of widespread (but quiet grumbling) discontent and apathy - lack of faith in the government but lack of faith in any alternatives. All the parties look fairly similar and are fronted by uninspiring, slimy or spineless leaders (guess who's who).

Is it worthwhile going up north? Yes.

So Talisker comes from Skye, which is a beautiful place, so you should try that out. Now, going to Scotland for whiskies is like going to a film festival for movies (I worked at the Edin Film Fest, so I like that analogy): The trick is not to drink the ones you can buy in the US, the trick is to fine the ones you won't find again.

Don't get me wrong. The heavily marketed and sold brands, like Lagavulin, Talisker, Laphroaig and so on are perfectly fine. In fact, I have a bottle of latter next to me. But the really cool thing is that there are so many oddities to discover. 

And this is not some snobbery that allows you to tell your grandchildren: ""You know, this one time I was in Scotland...""

Go to the Scottish Malt Whisky Experience thingy next to the castle. Make sure to get your basics right. It takes you literally an hour to get the basics about whisky right, in case you still drink it with ice.

And then there are two things you can do in Edinburgh:
– If this is your one time in Scotland, and you've got money to blow, become a member of the Scottish Malt Whisky society. They have Whisky bars (members only) with single cask Whiskys – http://www.smws.co.uk/. Here's the thing: The big brands (did you know that most of them are owned by Diageo?), even with their single malts, make small changes to guarantee consistency among batches (like colorants). The SMWS does not care. They fill 600 bottles (1 cask) of each batch, and that's it. They will never come back. And because they are so unique, they do not even put the name of the distillery on there.

- If you're spending all your money on golf clubs, and don't want to go large, go to a Whisky bar (http://www.edinburghwhiskyblog.com/whisky-bars/, http://www.yelp.co.uk/search?find_desc=whisky+bar&amp;find_loc=Edinburgh&amp;ns=1&amp;ls=5472261eec4fad8d), sit on the counter and listen to the guy/gal at the bar. Don't be demanding, but be interested instead. Ask them what they like, and if they have something you would not find elsewhere. Don't do it if they are too busy.

TL;DR: If you can, you have to go to the Islands. If you want to taste whisky, be daring, ask the bar keeper. In a good pub, they'll know.",0,1375133208,null,0,false,0,cbcucnr,t3_1ja21u,t1_cbcucnr,t1_cbctk76,null,1430120946,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

true,JoeTerp,null,null,"I'm not sure what the club can do.  If Skrtel cannot turn his form around to the level of 2 years ago, then the most obvious position is a CB to compliment Agger. We would want a top, top player who is aggressive, very good in the air, and pretty useful with the ball at their feet (but don't need to be quite as good as Agger).  Then its about finding this person in real life.  Rule out the CL clubs of England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France.  Where are these players? Kyriakos Papadopoulos was strongly linked, but the asking price seems very high especially considering the injury history.  Is Toby Alderweireld of the required quality?  I'm not so sure (maybe he is, but it doesn't seem obvious).

The next most obvious position of improvement depends on the Suarez situation.  If he stays, I think the next most obvious need is to bring in a top, top quality LB and have Enrique as backup, as well as an option to play further forward.  Again, there does not seem to be any available players to us at that level of quality.

Then there is the 2nd choice to Mkhitaryan.  I think that if Suarez stayed the ideal would be to play Coutinho and Suarez wide with Mkhitaryan behind Sturridge.  Plenty of fight, plently of skill, plenty of creativity, plenty of goals.  Who is available that can provide all the tools that Mkhitaryan has, notably the high motor to go along with the goals.  Well we could always move Coutinho central, and then buy someone to play out wide, but they would need to be someone who can score a lot of goals from out there, since Coutinho is mostly a set up man, who sometimes chips in.  I guess the plan for now might be Aspas, but I think someone with more quality is desired.

I think the biggest signing the club can make is holding on to Suarez at all costs.  Even though I don't love his game because of how crazy he can play at times, there is just no way we can get a player as good as him, no matter how much money we have.",0,1375133320,null,0,false,0,cbcuea3,t3_1jat15,t1_cbcuea3,t3_1jat15,null,1430120925,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You could try reading the judgment... but neither. He was jailed for disobeying an order from the judge; the judge's first instructions were:

&gt; “One, you do not discuss this case outside your number. That is a major responsibility and one which is easy for me to say but harder to put into effect. But it means that if your partner, your work colleague asks you tonight, at perhaps your Christmas party, “What is it all about at Wood Green Crown Court?” you politely, and firmly, say, “The first thing the Judge said to us was that we mustn’t discuss this at all until it is all over.” I am not going to repeat that. It is obvious. It is a particular responsibility of being a juror. 

The idea behind this is that the only things a juror should base their decision on is what happens in the court room. They are strictly forbidden from discussing it with outside people, because the court cannot control those outside people and the information they receive.

[The HMRC have guidance on writing tax software](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/softwaredevelopers/). If you want it to be exact you need to read it as there are some funky corner cases you need to know about. One thing I noticed immediately is that your tax calcs are slightly wrong because pennies shouldn't be taxed. NI has some funky rounding rules too. It's only pennies, but you might as well be right.

If you want to add more features I'd go for pension contributions, NI codes (just A and D would cover most people, the rest are pretty rare) and an option to enter your tax code.

It's about control; part of the principle of getting a fair trial is getting the right to defend yourself. The defendant is supposed to be able to challenge anything that is put before the jury. If a juror goes off and does their own research, the defendant cannot know what extra information the jury is basing their decision on, and so cannot challenge it; they might come across evidence that it inadmissible, they might find definitions of legal terms that they don't correctly interpret or that are wrong (from a different jurisdiction, perhaps).

* Northerners in **England** don't often identify very much with southerners. Accent, class divide and culture all play big part in this.
* Northerners in **Wales** often feel more ""Welsh"" than the southerners in Wales. This is a lot to do with the fact that South Wales has become a lot more Anglicised and the Welsh language is less prevalent.
* **Ireland** is an extreme example, but I don't think I need to say much here as everyone knows about this
* **Scotland** is a similar idea to Wales. The Northern reaches are less Anglicised so they are almost like foreigners to someone from Edinburgh for example.

You could go much deeper with all of this though. I would guess that there are dozens of strong sub national identities in England alone, each with their own ethnic history from when the British Isles were being buttraped left right and centre by every single country in Europe. Also the huge variation in accent and even football teams solidifies this.

true,PirateMud,eng-Bedfordshire,Bedfordshire,"Post-typing this seems to have been a bit of a vent for me, but a few paragraphs of depressed sounding shit into it I basically suggest signing up with some job agencies. It's not always gonna be good work, but it can help you get by...

Hey man, I know vaguely what you're going through. Some days I don't see the point in waking up until 12 or 1pm. I lie to my Dad on the phone when he calls at about 9 to see if I'm awake and out of bed. It's pretty fucking grim really, because I feel like shit if I actually wake up and I feel like shit if I don't.

Some days I get woken up by a phone call from someone who isn't my Dad. Sometimes these are phone calls from job interviews I've had to tell me that I've not got the job. Fucking great. It's 11am and it kicks me into a place where I can't even bear to do anything productive at all - I'll probably play GTA in 2 hour bursts for the entirety of the day. I can achieve things there.

Sometimes though the phone calls are from the local agencies. I'm signed up with them mainly to do stuff with an engineering labour type thing, because frankly I want to get in on some manufacturing based job - ideally, I'd be a draftsman, like my brother. But I'll basically say yes to anything. Pot wash at a local college canteen? Sure. Warehouse op? Sure. Putting frusli bars into boxes - that one's actually ok, pay is better than minimum wage and you can sometimes set the radio to a station that isn't Heart...

But seriously, I don't want to push pallet trucks around for the rest of my life. I don't want to scrub pots. Hell ideally I'd know what I'm doing next week *every* week. But it keeps my car in petrol and insurance/tax, it lets me pay my Dad a bit every month for being a resource hog, it lets me tell the jobcentre cunts to fuck off and stop being useless wastes of space, and it gets me down the pub every weekend and I can afford to get properly fucked up on some occasions if I so desire.

A friend of mine got a full time job through working for an agency. He did a job well for a few months via  the agency. Someone left the company he was working for, he was virtually headhunted for it. Ok, he makes ""only"" 15-20k per year, but he works 3 nights a week (36 hours, paid for 40, so the company can have him in for 16 or 17 extra nights per year before it turns into overtime) so he basically has a 4 day/night weekend. It's a pretty lame job, physically exhausting in some cases, and as I said he's working nights, somehow he's still full of energy though. Maybe in a few years he might end up in some kind of supervisory role rather than being the guy doing the heavy lifting, if he doesn't get a different job in the meantime.

Seriously dude, look at signing up to some job agencies. If nothing else you can expect a pleasant phone call that results in money every week or so, as opposed to the less pleasant ones where they kick you a bit while you're already feeling shite.",0,1375135924,null,0,false,0,cbcvf6v,t3_1j9o6z,t1_cbcvf6v,t3_1j9o6z,null,1430120447,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,WillSpur,flair2,,"The thing is they are very different. Lennon is your typical winger. Fast, agile, great skill and is murder for full backs to deal with. But he often lacks end product in his crosses and shots.

Chadli, who may not be as fast (although by no means slow), provides (from what we have seen and heard at least) a more potent attacking force. Skillful, good on the ball and has a good talent for scoring on his stronger foot. i.e. what is looking to be the way AVB likes his team and 433; inverted wingers cutting inside on their stronger foot, and contributing to the attack.

Bale played on the right a lot last season, and as a result saw his goal tally rocket. Cutting onto his stronger left foot absolute murdered teams. Chadli will have been brought into to do similar damage on the left, cutting onto his right.

As much as I love Lennon, he isn't exactly what we or AVB rather are looking for at the moment. You can say he will hang on to his role, but his role is as a classic pacey winger on the right...where Bale will be playing. He has been played on the left but didn't pose much of a goal scoring threat.

Let's be honest, can we really imagine Lennon commanding the left side of the pitch and banging in multiple goals on his right foot? He'll be a GREAT player to throw on off the bench to keep the pace and terrorise tiring defences but...I'm afraid, its looking likely his style of play wont be suited to formation/tactics Andre is looking likely to implement. Lennon scored 4 assisted 8 this season, Chadli scored 18 and assisted 1 in 26 appearances for Twente.

I'm confident next seasons play will be a lot more attacking, but the front 3, particularly the wingers, wont be about beating your man and sticking a cross in. It will be more of them as a whole providing an attacking threat themselves and contributing their own goal tally.

Just want to throw in as well, I do rate Lennon. He terrorises defences with his speed but more so his DEFENSIVE work rate is unreal. His contribution is undoubtedly huge, I just think Nadli is something different and more in the direction we are heading towards.",0,1375136134,null,0,1375136709,0,cbcvhzp,t3_1j9ef9,t1_cbcvhzp,t1_cbct9pa,null,1430120411,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,agoMiST,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"As a resident of Blackpool I will admit the place is, generally, a shit hole.
Employment prospects for a vast swathe of the town exist for only 7-8 months of a year; the council is more intent on spending money on shiny sculptures and shitty 'fountains' to entertain tourists than actually improving the town's infrastructure and improving things for those that live here. As a resort town we have a massive transitory population which has grossly changed from the families having a seaside getaway of 20 years ago to huge packs of wild and uninhibited, binge drinking, young (and not so young) people...
If you get up early on a Saturday or Sunday morning the streets of the town centre are strewn with pizza boxes, half eaten kebabs, plenty of vomit and broken glass.

The article, however, strikes me as highly myopic and feels like it's pushing an agenda...

Currently the council are trying to push through the EMRO (Early Morning Restriction Order) which would prohibit the sale of alcohol between the hours of 3am and 6am. This, they say, is to prevent crime (assaults, vandalism etc) and to stop excessive drinking...

The problem with this is multi-faceted:

Currently not everywhere in the centre of town closes at the same time, this leads to a comfortable staggered egress of punters. Some will move on to another club others will head home; the important point is that it keeps the streets relatively dead throughout the whole night and whilst they're not there to police the streets, having establishments open with door staff until 7am in the morning provides a better level of security and safety than having the whole town centre a ghost town for 4 hours with everyone that had gone out for the night loosed onto the streets at the same time. For some reason the council doesn't see that as a recipe for chaos and more violence.

The town is already dying; pubs, clubs, shops, B&amp;Bs close down on a near weekly basis. Given we're a town that relies heavily on tourist trade and one of the few elements that still brings people into the town on a regular basis (i.e. not seasonal) is the night life, such as it is, why would you cripple it. It may not seem like much but by preventing the sale of alcohol for just 3 hours you're going to deter people from coming here when they could go elsewhere without such restrictions. Not only would the economy be negatively impacted by the reduction in visitors you'll compound the problem as people begin to lose jobs due to lack of viable hours...

The crime argument is absolute horseshit. A lot of violence and vandalism happens when clubs kick out, how does moving that time slot up by a few hours reduce crime... If the argument is, ""well, less time to drink"" then I pity you, the people most likely to commit these crimes because of alcohol will do one of two things: start drinking earlier in the day or drink faster to make the most of the reduced amount of time.

Onto something different now: Cutting housing benefit...

FUCK YOU!!!!!

They've already cut back on housing benefit and council tax benefit over the last 3 years and I know more people it has harmed than has helped, myself included.
In fact by cutting housing benefit you're playing into the hands of these landlords even more.

The problem is the council mismanaging its budget for short term gains rather than long term improvements.

If you can, try making new contacts - would it be possible to join a club or something near you? Something like a sports team would be good. The more people you know, the more chance you have of hearing about jobs, and then you'll have a bit of a foot in the door. Plus having some company might help you in feeling a little more positive about things. 

Keep looking for volunteer work too - have you checked do-it.org.uk? 

Definitely try for some of the more 'unpleasant' seeming jobs, like say support/care work and cleaning. They have less competition and definitely cleaning doesn't require experience. 

Also, if you can type fairly fast, try looking into an at home typist job. Avoid any that ask you to pay money up front because they are just scams. But some of the others are legit(ish...) You'd have to register as self-employed (which comes with some issues that you'd need to consider before taking on, such as if you're fired for any reason you will be ineligible to claim JSA afterwards) and you aren't guaranteed a lot of work (or even minimum wage unfortunately), but they do seem to hire pretty much anyone who applies.

When it gets proper wintery then add a wooly hat and gloves and scarf. as /u/JeffMartinsMandolin said you need to get decent shoes for the winter so your feet don't freeze. If you are a lady I'd recommend getting some nice boots you can wear wooly sock in under tights with a skirt. This will help with not getting wet as well (I always find a skirt and boots is quicker to dry out than trousers and boots or shoes).

If you're a bloke then you can get away with some good waterproof trainers or (if you're feeling adventurous) then walking boots. I was wearing walking boots this winter because they were the best thing to walk through snow in apart from wellies and I didn't want to be wearing wellies all the time.

If you're in alright halls you shouldn't need an electric blanket since most are alright in terms of heating, a student rented house might be a different kettle of fish. You're better off investing in a good jumper you can wear around the house and you like. For when it gets really cold IKEA do these amazing, what I call, duvet boots around winter time which are shoes made of duvet. They are the comfiest and warmest things and are much better than slippers.

This winter when it got really cold I was normally in a tshirt and jumper (or just a long sleeved jumper thing), a hoodie and then a coat. Plus hat, scarf and gloves, I do get very cold easily though. Was also wearing trousers or a skirt fyi.

I've never needed an electric blanket. A hot water bottle has suited me if it's been really cold. Mainly used it for aches and pains though. An extra blanket to go over your duvet is a worthwhile investment if you have a cold house. 

If you find that you are getting cold getting out of bed in the morning then a good tip is keeping your slippers (or awesome duvet boots) and dressing gown close by the bed so you can put them on quickly as you're getting out of bed. 

If you are finding the lack of light is making you feel a bit depressed in winter then invest in a sunlight lamp and use it to get you up in the morning. They are on the expensive side at around £60ish but worth it if you need that extra bit of sunlight because you're not used to the dark winters.

I would recommend getting a good umbrella as well or a good waterproof jacket because the UK is quite wet. I'm a Mancunian where it rains a lot but it's still worth it in other places in the UK. Being cold is one thing but being cold and wet is quite another.   ",0,1375137418,null,0,false,0,cbcvz5a,t3_1j9qv6,t1_cbcvz5a,t3_1j9qv6,null,1430120189,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There is high turnover in First Line (and depending on the company, 2nd Line too) which means it is usually easy to find jobs, and you really just need people skills in 1st Line and an eye for detail, as you are the first point of contact for the users. You can progress easily through the levels, if you start now you can be at 3rd level support by the time you are 30. Where I work the rates are usually about 15k for 1st level, 18-20k for 2nd level and 26k for 3rd level Desktop Support.

It's all about getting your foot in the door. I did some work experience at a place with 3rd level Desktop, ended up joining their team on a temp contract to help them rollout some new laptops, got a contract renewal, and then applied for an internal trainee database administrator role. All of that happened without me even really wanting to get into IT...

Some general advice. Be prepared, it shows you care, have foresight and are intelligent. That means write cover letters for every job you apply for, detailing why you are applying, why you want to work there, what you can bring to the role and what the role can offer you in terms of career development. Personalize your CV for every job you apply for, make your skills stand out for the role, I did X which made me better at y, where y will be a skill listed in the job description.

Prepare for interviews. Ask yourself common questions everyday. What was something you handled poorly? How would you handle a team member who wasnt pulling their weight? What do you do if you don't understand something? etc.etc. and prepare questions to ask them too.

I highly recommend applying for 1st line support. Go on jobserve.co.uk as they should have some jobs on there, don't be worried about any skills they ask for, they wont expect much at 1st Line. You can teach yourself SQL easily with the sqlzoo.net tutorial and it shows a potential employer you are interested in IT.

If you do decide to apply for an IT role I will happily look at your CV or cover letter, as I have a moderate amount of experience in applying for these sorts of roles, and any extra opinion helps!

Valdes is the one who has caused the problems here, and I think Liverpool have been pretty cool in helping to find Reina a one-year solution to keep him playing at the top level until he moves to Barca.

&gt;Liverpool agree single-season loan deal for Paraguayan left back Lorenzo Melgarejo. #LFC #SLB #PAR
Liverpool and Benfica have agreed the transfer of Paraguayan left back Lorenzo Melgarejo subject to a work permit. Melgarejo will move to Anfield on an initial single-season loan with Liverpool holding an option to make the transfer permanent for a fee of less than €10million next summer. 

&gt; A converted winger, Benfica extended Melgarejo's contract until 2018 in September following his promotion to a starting berth. The 22-year-old made his first appearance for the Paraguay national team two months later. Known for his skill on the ball, the 1m71 Melgarejo is not a particularly combative defender. He is, however, a low-cost option for Liverpool, being paid around €500,000 a year at present.

He is a striker.  That sets him apart from basically every other player in our squad.  It isn't fair to expect Suarez-esque dribbling or Coutinho-esque passing from him.

In his preseason appearances, Borini has run tirelessly to create space for other attacking players and has made himself available for many key passes that simply were not delivered.  This isn't to say other players were wrong for choosing other passes, as our system calls for a lot of discipline and low-risk passing.  However, I think Borini has performed at a higher standard than our scorelines indicate and certainly better than our sub has widely recognized.
