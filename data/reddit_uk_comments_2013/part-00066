It's not controlling immigration that's racist. However, there's a sort of racist, xenophobic undertone to much of the talk about it.

&gt;Can't talk about leaving EU, that's crazy

Well, it is. You're massively reducing the incentives for businesses to deal with the UK, since we'd be out of the common market and putting up lots of barriers to trade with Europe as a consequence.

&gt;Can't talk about the nanny state, that's overreacting.

As opposed to a state that leaves people to die on the streets?

&gt; Politicians would rather meet with lobbyists than constituents, the EU demands budget increases while destroying other countries economies,

I can agree with you there.

&gt;immigration into this country (whether its good or bad) is unchecked from eastern Europe

Is it ""unchecked""? We know plenty about how much immigration there is. Yes, we can't stop it without leaving the EU, but it's worth considering two things:

1. EU migration is a two-way street. A lot of Brits like being able to retire in Spain or Portugal.

2. EU migrants to the UK are net contributors of tax, and have lower benefit claims rates than the general population.

&gt;the taxes on everyone are too high and government spending is even higher.

Yep.

&gt;These are the issues most people care about, and maybe UKIP doesn't have all the answers but at least they're talking about the problems.

That's not really an argument to vote for them, though.

Bale plays a more attacking wing position in a staggered front 3, with Bale and Lennon providing pace abuse.

You're sort of right. The Doctor Dances, The Snowmen, and The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe were Moffat-written episodes that had feeling-based resolutions. Like you said though, he's the showrunner and he should be keeping it in check. 

Closing Time had the dumbest, sappiest resolution that the show has ever had. You can resist a cyber conversion just by loving your child enough?

&gt;This popped up: a more resonable solution is a KDB loan + 20m for Schurrle http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2013/4/5/4187066/chelsea-fc-bayer-leverkusen-kevin-de-bruyne-andre-schurrle-loan-swap-transfer-rumor#comments
This move makes sense, actually, if Mou, or anybody else that plays a 4-3-3, returns. Schurrle would offer us forward wing options because we'll have 2 winger spots with Hazard, Moses, Piazon if he returns, arguably Mata (though I personally would play him in the top of an inverted triangle duo alongside Rami because Mata's been so good as a true #10 this year), and Schurrle vying for those winger spots. And Schurrle can track back well too. And then in the engine-box of the midfield we'd have options galore: Essien, Mikel, Romeu, Rami, Oscar (who would probably drop deeper in this scenario), Chalobah, Ake perhaps, Luiz maybe, and McEachran would all fit well into varying options of a midfield three.
What KDB gives us in this scenario that Schurrle doesn't is varying depth - he's very capable of going out wide and playing winger but also playing the Lampard role in a midfield 3. So it really depends on what manager comes in and what formation they'd play, but TBH this move looks like a cater-to-a-potential-Mourinho-formation buy.",0,1365223066,null,0,false,0,c99iygg,t3_1brol5,t1_c99iygg,t3_1brol5,null,1431655731,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Like the great Moffat episodes have always been ones that were very smart and well told: Empty Child and Blink come to mind. Whereas the great Davies episodes like Midnight focus greatly on the emotional aspects. Of course, there are the exceptions like Girl in the Fireplace, which is awesome as an emotional episode. I feel like a lot of that emotional depth has been slipping away. In fact, the first half of Season 7 has felt to me like throwing away the Ponds rather than sending them off. In fact, the Ponds weren't entirely necessary in any of the episodes save for Angels (Which destroyed the Weeping angels for me) and Power of Three (Which really should have been a 2 parter rather than a Deus Ex Machina).

I think I would have preferred sending off the Ponds by removing Angels and having Power of Three come to some emotional climax and finishing the storyline of the Girl who Waited and the Last Centurion as they come to terms with not waiting anymore. Even the outright sacrifice and death of the Ponds would have sat better with me.

Anyway up he trundles to the housing office with me in tow to provide some moral support. They basically told him that he was going to have to get used to being homeless, and to get himself to this homeless shelter where he could see a doctor. 

Why would he want to see a doctor? Because, they said, if he wasn't already he was definitely going to become depressed and he should get medicated but, and I couldn't make this up if I tried, she told him that 'being depressed won't count as being vulnerable because depression is 'just part of modern life' and he's just going to have to 'get used to it'.

This coming from a council worker, mind you, not a doctor, so bear that in mind. 

Then she said he could potentially get £77 for a room somewhere if he could find one, handed him a list of private hostels who might offer a bed for a few nights at that price and wished him good luck telling him to return with their paperwork if he was able to find a place, otherwise here's the number for the team when it snows outside. 

So yeah - he's hostel surfing when he can get a room now, completely off the job market despite having a degree, and I can't help much more because I'm back home now many many miles away from where he has to live (family connections in the area are the only thing keeping him eating some days, and yes, if they had any space he'd be living with them but life isn't always that simple).

East Germany were barred by Protocol III of the Treaty of Brussels, 1954 from posessing or developing a nuclear weapons programme. In theory they could now develop one as a sucessor state but don't need to as they have 60 x B61 nuclear bombs loaned them from the US under NATO command. Those devices have a variable yield up to 340Kt, more than three times larger than ours... so as much as Germany like to play the pious bystander they are as much a nuclear state as the UK or France.

When the first firearms were developed people considered them *morally bankrupt* to. The notion that a simple peasent soldier could kill an aristocrat with the pull of a trigger was horrifying.

I'm pretty sure it's done on purpose.

I first saw Event Horizon when I was pretty young, and it was one of the scariest films I'd seen, having grown up watching Horror movies as my favourite genre. But I think it also has to do with state of mind, because watching a movie when you're home alone, 12 years old, tired, and on a night when it's stormy vs when others are at home, and it's a nice sunny day - it affects you, which is why, shamefully to say, when I first watched the first Final Destination, I had, not really nightmares, but unpleasant dreams for a few weeks after. 

But anyway when talking about Event Horizon, I was more talking about the imagery - the story isn't anything all that special, but the imagery is still weird and quite scary, and that has aged well, in my opinion. The few bits of floating objects with poor CGI let it down, but aside from that, it could easily have been made this year.

South Korea, the 15th biggest economy in the world, has it's capital city Seoul, home to 10 million people, just 25 miles south of one of the most beligerant, aggressive nuclear powers on the planet that has just threatened to destroy them in a storm of fire. A south korean analyst on the news yesterday was talking about official estimates of 75% losses to infrastructure and human life in Seoul in the event of a conflict. 

If they shelled Seoul the west would have a real problem on its hands... Option A is to attack an indoctrinated nuclear power who's leadership is most likely to use their nuclear devices in a final act of suicide. Option B is to do nothing and watch NK inflict massive material and human damage on SK. Option C is to play it down and hope for the best, which is unsuprisingly what the west is doing as its the best option.

Despite our military strength, the western position on NK is actually deceptively weak. We are between a rock and a hard place. Can't really fight NK unless we commit to totally invade, disarm and destroy their ruling regieme only to implant a puppet government, amongst a people who literally belive Kim Jong Un is a sort of living deity. It could end up being a new Iraq/Vietnam. Add into that mix the issue of the Chinese (who like having a pseudo-vasal state between the wealthy capitalist SK and their own impoverished North-west region). Bear in mind, the reason there is a 'north' korea and a 'south' korea is because the Chinese threatened to enter into the Korean war on behalf of the north.

&gt;North Korea does now have missile technology that is able to reach, as they put it, the whole of the United States and if they are able to reach the whole of the United States they can reach Europe too. They can reach us too, so that is a real concern.

It is a lie, North Korea do not have missiles capable of reaching the US or the UK or Europe, and David Cameron must have known this because he's the prime minister and needs to have some sense of the actual threat faced to the country.

&gt;The point Cameron was making was the threat they pose is a general one towards the stability of the region and to world peace on the whole, and the presence of a strong western nuclear deterrent is postively sensible right now. They have a pretty strong bargaining position as it is with 2-3 devices and no missile delivery system... imagine how strong their bargaining position would be if the west had no deterrant!

At the moment he's having enormous 'fun' trying to find someone to let him a room as a guy in his early thirties newly single, newly unemployed and newly homeless (and yes, one thing led to another there within the space of 6 months). Try to remember that the LHA reduction has also kicked in so the pool of available rooms is now smaller than ever before. The situation right now for those on the bottom rung has not only never seemed bleaker, but it also is bleaker. One of the first things to go in most areas has been support for those at the very bottom, presumably because with no address they have no voice to argue. 

For reference - the situation can vary slightly from area to area, but apply some logical thought here: it's going to be a race to the bottom because the moment desperate people hear their suffering might be slightly less in another area, they're going to flock there necessitating the area in question to reduce it's services or be swamped. It can't work any other way, and that's what certain papers, pundits and politicians really hope no one pieces together until they can make the homeless a 'problem to be dealt with' and score some cheap political points from it further down the road.

Warnock leaving the club has really revitalised my enthusiasm, actually.

Byram---Peltier---Pearce---Warnock

Green---Norris---Tonge---Varney

(Although I would point out that Moffat's new-found production values or not, the BBC doesn't really keep to the same ideals that Hollywood does. Thankfully.)

But please take a moment to think. Not only is criticizing a cosplayer for their body rude -- and it is, regardless of whether it's you telling this total stranger that her breasts are too small (who *cares* what size they are?), or if it's the knobs up-thread making fun of a woman's teeth -- but it doesn't make any sense.

true,DaLateDentArthurDent,rory,Rory,"I had an idea for an episode as well, basically it's my excuse to have an episode set in the estates again, like where Rose lived.

I loved those episodes and think it's one thing that we haven't seen much of since Moffat took over.

The idea is basically that The Doctor takes Clara back home and inadvertently gets invited to dinner at Clara's dads house. When they arrive Clara is shocked to find her dad has a new girlfriend.

Basically around the estate unusual phenomena has been happening, street lights turn green and by the time they turn orange again someone has gone missing, just vanished. The Doctor has to maintain his secret identity whilst also finding out what's going on.

In the end it would turn out that Mr. Oswald's girlfriend is the one causing it, the lights turning green is actually the opening of an alternate reality, the whole estate is being transported there and when they go back, one less person is returned, The Doctor manages to stop the process, return everyone and make it so that she doesn't have these functions anymore. 

It needs a bit of work but I think it's pretty decent, a good old fashioned bottle episode.

Another idea I had was a whole series story arc, The Doctor meets one of his old companions, someone who helped in one episode (Elton Pope, maybe Adam from series 1) but never travelled with him and he gives them a chance to come see the universe (this would be after Clara has left and after the 50th, The Doctor will be in a mood where he wants to reconnect with people he left behind).

During the series, the TARDIS would seem to be growing weaker and weaker, not going to the right places and randomly shutting down and The Doctor can't figure out why, until the last episode (a good old fashioned two/three parter). Also his old friends seem to be disappearing from the records and only he can remember them, The Doctor realizes after taking his companion back to their own time that the world is the same as it was, but no one can remember who he is, when people try to recall him they can't place the name or face. The Doctor goes back into the TARDIS where it is now reaching it's death, and announce that he's figured it out, the companion he is currently with is actually a body decoy, the memories, attitude and body of an old friend, someone he'd trust enough to let into the TARDIS and he been designed to sap the TARDIS's time energy whenever it makes a journey, but really that person was actually killed and erased from time.

The Doctor exits the TARDIS angry and bitter, he opens the door to see all of his companions, all of them in a trance as they have been made into body decoys as well and in the centre of them all is The Valeyard, relishing in his victory he the companions restrain The Doctor and has Captain Jack shoot him in the chest. He then tells The Doctor that now he will regenerate into him and that this is the final step to allow the Time Lords to retake the universe.

The Doctor, dying, is carried into the TARDIS by his old friends and they all stand around as watch as he starts to regenerate (with a blue energy and not the usual orange, the TARDIS comes to life briefly, and absorbs the regenerative energy, it uses this energy to show the companions the records from when they were with The Doctor, bringing them all back into existence with all memories intact, they all then stand in shock as they realize that The Doctor is regenerating. 

Outside The Valeyard is beamed up into a Dalek battleship, he tells them to watch, positive that The Doctor's regeneration will destroy Earth. Unbeknownst to him though the TARDIS, in one final act to save The Doctor, cleans up his regeneration, preventing him from becoming the Valeyard, and travels out into space, The Doctor regenerates in 12/13 (becoming ginger in the process), Earth explodes and The Valeyard moves on to Gallifrey. 

After that we move onto part 2 where The Doctor, by regenerating normally has created a paradox, as The Valeyard should no longer exist, he decides that they need to create an even bigger paradox with which they can take out The Valeyard. or something like that

London is for geographical and financial reasons and intrinsically excellent target for anyone, NK or otherwise, who wants to inflict maximum damage on the west. In many ways, more so than any US city (except perhaps Manhatten island) as the US is more distributed, sparsely populated, and could handle the loss of a single large city.

As I've said, Cameron was wrong to use the NK situation as a specific example, but he was making the point that we live in a rapidly changing world where for a number of reasons we are a prime target - and the fact rogue states are using nuclear weapons as a bargaining tool only serves to reinforce the importance of our indepedent nuclear deterrent. Unfortunately he can't come out and say that becasue it isn't sound-bitey enough to be newsworthy.

When they closed in 2011 a lot of ex-employees set up their own independent studios. West Pier is one of them;  also see:  Roundcube Entertainment, ShortRound Games, Boss Alien , etc.

There are a lot of articles on [Games Industry International](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/) if you search for 'Black Rock', which will give you an idea of just what happened and how many have sprung up.  At last count I reckon there's eleven or twelve ex-BR studios in the Brighton/Hove area.

No there isn't, it's people like you who manufacture that fallacy. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is a small contingent of racists and xenophobes among the huge and growing movement who want immigration reform, but that doesn't make the message any less legitimate given that the vast majority are perfectly normal, perfectly openminded people with real concerns.

There are some insane-o ultra-left ultra-liberal people on the other side too, who believe that because we had an Empire we should sell all of our worldly goods and give the money to gypsies; or that being a rich country makes us responsible for the world's poor. Does that delegitimise the whole of that side of the message as well?

&gt;Well, it is. You're massively reducing the incentives for businesses to deal with the UK, since we'd be out of the common market and putting up lots of barriers to trade with Europe as a consequence.

This is the dumbest thing I keep hearing repeat itself, the idea that if we left the EU that every other EU country would stop trading with us is just so far out of this world wrong that I don't even know where to start. 

92% of our trade contracts would persist through a UK exit, for every job that relies on the EU there is another in the EU that relies on the UK - not only is our relationship symbiotic but we actually have the edge because we're a net exporter to the EU, are you actually suggesting that they're going to stop buying those goods and services, fire all those employees and close their markets in some sort of childish trantrum? Get real, money trumps ideology, the EU would be all over a trade treaty with us if separation became a reality.

&gt;I can agree with you there.

If you agree with it then stop dismissing it; UKIP connecting with the voters whilst the big three get further and further out of touch is not an accident.

&gt;Is it ""unchecked""? We know plenty about how much immigration there is. Yes, we can't stop it without leaving the EU, but it's worth considering two things:
&gt;
&gt;1. EU migration is a two-way street. A lot of Brits like being able to &gt;retire in Spain or Portugal.
&gt;2. EU migrants to the UK are net contributors of tax, and have lower &gt;benefit claims rates than the general population.

It's absolutely unchecked, I don't know on what basis you argue otherwise? It's completely out of our control.

1. I wish people would stop saying this. How can you **possibly** compare affluent retirees that buy property, products and services into their new country, who bring all of their money with them - with the masses of unskilled, transient labour we import who send their money out of the country? Also, in what world do you think that the UK leaving the EU would have them close their borders to us? We would still be able to visit, live and work in those countries, anyone who says otherwise is lying.

2. Except we don't count outside of those parameters, meaning we don't track their money leaving the country, we don't track the impact on services and this also completely ignores illegal immigration.

&gt;Yep.

Agree then dismiss, great, I wonder why UKIP is garnering so much support!

&gt;That's not really an argument to vote for them, though.

Of course it is, not to put them into power, but to challenge the current power to change. Spoiling your ballet or voting for the MRLP will change nothing - scaring the big three into doing something by having UKIP drain votes from them is powerful.

&gt; We are in control of it, just not within the EU.

Oh well that's okay then. /s

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;No there isn't, it's people like you who manufacture that fallacy. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is a small contingent of racists and xenophobes among the huge and growing movement who want immigration reform, but that doesn't make the message any less legitimate given that the vast majority are perfectly normal, perfectly openminded people with real concerns.

&gt;There are some insane-o ultra-left ultra-liberal people on the other side too, who believe that because we had an Empire we should sell all of our worldly goods and give the money to gypsies; or that being a rich country makes us responsible for the world's poor. Does that delegitimise that side of the message too?

I don't really believe you here. Some people seem to be anti-immigration simply because they don't like foreigners. Of course, this is not everyone, but there are a lot of people like that. I don't know what you're on about with these ""ultra-liberal"" folks, though. I've never heard anything like that.

&gt;This is the dumbest thing I keep hearing repeat itself, the idea that if we left the EU that every other EU country would stop trading with us is just so far out of this world wrong that I don't even know where to start.

That's not what I said. What I said is that outside of the EU it would be more difficult for EU businesses to trade with us, and that may mean less business. 

&gt;92% of our trade contracts would persist through a UK exit, for every job that relies on the EU there is another in the EU that relies on the UK - not only is our relationship symbiotic but we actually have the edge because we're a net exporter to the EU, are you actually suggesting that they're going to stop buying those goods and services, fire all those employees and close their markets in some sort of childish trantrum? Get real, money trumps ideology, the EU would be all over a trade treaty with us if separation became a reality.

Again, that's not what I said. I'm saying that leaving the common market makes trade harder, which means we will not see quite as much as otherwise.

&gt;It's absolutely unchecked, I don't know on what basis you argue otherwise? It's completely out of our control.

""Out of control""? 

&gt;1. I wish people would stop saying this. How can you **possibly** compare affluent retirees that buy property, products and services into their new country, who bring all of their money with them - with the masses of unskilled, transient labour we import who send their money out of the country? Also, in what world do you think that the UK leaving the EU would have them close their borders to us? We would still be able to visit, live and work in those countries, anyone who says otherwise is lying.

I don't see what the problem with sending their money out of the country is. They still spend an awful lot of it while they're here, they pay a lot of taxes.

But obviously, we would no longer have the magical privileges of being able to just go to Spain and live there. We would have to get visas. There would be a lot more red tape.

&gt;Except we don't count outside of those parameters, meaning we don't track their money leaving the country, we don't track the impact on services and this also completely ignores illegal immigration.

Again, what is wrong with people sending their money out of the country?

Leaving the EU would not affect illegal immigration. So long as we have the channel tunnel and ferries, there will be plenty of it.

&gt;I'm genuinely curious about something though; I asked this in another thread but didn't get an answer from your side; Can you explain to me the argument against a required skills-list? As in, a list where we invite those we desperately need in with open arms but keep those out who we don't need? I really want to know.

I'm not arguing against it. I believe that's the approach we take with non-EU immigration. However, within the EU we don't do this, because in the EU there is this nice concept of ""freedom of movement"", where you don't have to get a visa, you can simply go and work there. I like this concept, possibly because I stand to benefit from it, my friends have benefited from it, and because there's a chance I wouldn't be here today without it.

true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"Totally agree with the loan part. I think the clubs were a bit too easy to let players to go to smaller clubs. That being said, Crewe, Bournmouth, Wolves, Bolton, etc. are good places to go with a higher standard and the environment to toughen up. Also, maybe truthfully we didn't really have the type of talent that warranted loans to those types of clubs and you know that fucking list is pretty long the last few decades!

As for the first team opportunities, I think that you have to be ready for your chances. Yeah, the transfer fuckups at the beginning of the season and injuries put the club behind the preverbal 8-ball, but you have to be ready for your chances since they'll pop up at any moment. Unsworth does Robbie's knee and Welsh Midget gets the call and the rest was history. Was a little upset that Adam Morgan didn't take his chances early this season, but he's still very, very young. Plus I think we've given the younger players the right amount of matches for the season for their development. 10-20 matches is about right for them in terms of exposure. We don't want to burn them out or put too much pressure on them. Psychologically you don't want to damage them as well. I really did not like how some of our home support were getting on the backs of Robinson, Wisdom, and even Sterling this season. Yes, some of the performances weren't great, but its an education and hard slag an U20 player like that even with the ""well if they're in the first-team then..."" mentality. Sterling looked like he started to 2nd guess a lot of things as soon as he got that contract and I think the opposition were mixing it up a lot of their defensive schemes to confuse him.

It's become a game of wills between the new premier Kim Jong Un, keen to prove his mettle internally, and the US/Korea keen to use Kim Jong Un's inexperience to paint him as a weak leader internally - with the hope that will sound the begining of the end for the NK government.

As soon as sufficiently widespread political infighting occurs within NK, I expect the West and/or China will be able to drive a wedge in deeper by providing support to whoever the least objectionable party is... rather like the Arab Spring.

The only danger is Kim could really call our bluff. If they did do something like shelling Seoul, I'm not sure the west would necessarily respond the way people expect. As now Kim has the threat of using a nuclear weapon, even on their own soil, as the defiant last stand of a cornered regieme. That means the west would need to be extremely confident they could defeat and supress the vast NK military aparatus without allowing massive collateral casualties to occur in SK... even with our current technology that would be very hard.

I actually have a theory they may try something like capturing those islands near the northern limit line in a show of force. If they did that it wouldn't necessarily warrant an immiediate military response from the west... but it would force the west to acknowledge them as a viable threat. Other alternatives would be sinking shipping in that area (like they did to the Cheonan a few years back). Basically any morally ambigious show of force.

David Cameron has been using the situation in North Korea to back up the idea of renewal, saying,
&gt;Britain still needs the ultimate weapon of defence. North Korea recently conducted it's third nuclear test and could already have enough fissile material to produce more than a dozen nuclear weapons.
&gt;
&gt;Last year North Korea unveiled a long-range ballistic missile which it claims can reach the whole of the United States. If this became a reality it would also affect the whole of Europe, including the UK.

So I'd actually say the deterrant is more important than the economy - which ultimately is a short-medium term issue, wheras safety is a long term one.

I would also reject wholesale the financial argument, as ultimately this cash will be spent internally for the most part actually boosting the economy. Infact, this is exactly one of those major infrastructure projects to help the economy that liberals keep banging on about.

It takes a chunk off you insurance too. (I'm not sure if you need a certain amount of time before you can do it.) It basically involves 8 2hr Sunday morning drives with an instructor.

Pass plus is a joke but if you don't do it then make absolutely sure the first time you join a motorway you have someone experienced with you. Also pick a junction you know and where the slip lane ends it turns into hard shoulder and not barrier so you have a run off.

true,ha5hmil,null,null,"EDIT - Yes, Season 1 episode 1 - Rose, that would be the best place to start. (which was how i got into it myself just less than 6 months ago) Having said that, try the following: (tried and tested with several of my friends who i have converted to be Whovians.)
-----

I would suggest to start from Season 5 episode one: Eleventh Hour. Just the first episode. This is Matt Smith's (11th Doctor) first episode - and compared to earlier seasons has a great production value (not saying the others are rubbish, but DW started REALLY stepping up after this). This episode also does a great deal to introduce you to the Who world. 

Once you have done with just the one Matt Smith episode go back to Christopher Eccelston (9th Doctor) which is Season 1. The episode 1 is titled ""Rose"". This was in 2009 and the production aspect of it wouldn't be that great compared to the latest episodes. So you will have to bear with some of the cheesy effects and plots etc. Going back and starting from 2005 lets you really understand and know the doctor, his companions, the TARDIS (the blue police box), the villains and all that stuff. And essentially fall in love with the doctor and the characters. And be prepared to have your heart broken over and over. You do really fall in love with the characters. 

I started straight from Season One - Rose. Beforehand i used to hate Doctor Who. And Season One wasn't doing any help - i used to watch and say ""oh how shit is that CGI, this doesn't make any sense"" and so on. But i stuck into it, and a few episodes in i was HOOKED. I ended up watching 6 seasons within the space of 2 weeks. Immediately afterwards suffered from Doctor Who withdrawals wanting more episodes. and oh boy now it's in Season 7 - and it's back on the telly and can't tell you how excited i am for tonights episode!! (and the upcoming 50th anniversary special too)

Oh and the classic doctor who (pre-2005) - leave that for later. There some really good stuff there too, but there are so many of them which you can get into later after watching the reboot episodes from 2005 onwards.

TL:DR: - start from Season 5, Episode 1 - The Eleventh Hour. Just the one episode. Then go back to Season 1, Episode 1 - Rose. Classics - leave for later.",0,1365263218,null,0,1365267279,0,c99pfe5,t3_1bsqz2,t1_c99pfe5,t3_1bsqz2,null,1431652609,-5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-5

Look at the age of the universe.  Billions of years, plus all that bit before life happened and time didn't really mean anything.  But life happened, and it's billions of years before that even starts turning into anything like creatures.

And humans only came on the scene, what, 200,000 years ago?  And it was only around 50,000 years ago that we started to civilize.

And now?  In the eyeblink of universal time, we're contemplating the mysteries of the building blocks of the world, and launching ourselves into space.  Because everywhere we look, we go, ""Hey neat!"" and have to go check it out.

The drive of humanity to build and invent and see new stuff is just astounding.  And, so far as we know so far, unprecedented in the universe.  Maybe there are other civs out there, but right now, humans are the highest form of life we know.   

And we're really doing an OK job at it, if you consider that 2,000 years ago tossing sacrifices into pits to be mauled by animals was the height of pop entertainment.   Now we just mock people's shitty singing on TV.

I'm pretty sure she still only has one heart and doesn't have all the Time Lord characteristics.

As far as the Doctor continuing, a popular theory or proposition to getting around the 12 regenerations rule (which means that we actually have 2 more Doctors after Matt Smith, 12 regenerations, 13 Doctors) is that it's not a biological limit, it's a legal limit imposed by Rassilon and the Time Lord government to prevent any one person from gaining too much power or using their nigh-immortality to be reckless. With no Time Lord society to enforce the limit, the Doctor could theoretically go regenerate forever. (This is in part based on the fact that, like someone else mentioned, the Time Lords gave the Master more regenerations. If you take this to be that they allowed him to regenerate more instead of giving them to him physically, this theory becomes pretty solid.)",0,1365269454,null,0,false,0,c99r7pr,t3_1bssk6,t1_c99r7pr,t3_1bssk6,null,1431651767,30,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,30

You do need to understand the kind if risk you're willing to undertake. You can get a govvie fund if you're really risk averse (but low rate of return), or an emerging economies one if you're very progressively inclined (potential high return, high risk). I put my cash into a sort of 'fund of funds' to spread my risk a bit, leaning toward a fairly risky profile. 

With stocks and shares ISAs there are fees, both deposit and maintenance so you have to view them as a medium term investment; 3-5 years. If you might need the cash in 6 months to a year, it's not for you.

City is facing Utd. tomorrow and they will more than likely lose which would put us within 4 points of them, again. 

They have Wigan between Utd. and Spurs but if they even drop a point against them thing will be looking REALLY good for us. They probably won't drop points though.

With Bale back to Spurs against City, they may actually lose against Spurs as well while we're playing Fulham that week. If we win that we'r within a point of City. 

After Spurs they've got all weak teams left, a couple of them fighting for relegation, so hopefully they fuck up and drop points which would give us a chance to get second. 

But after Fulham we have Liverpool, Utd. and Swansea which we may possibly drop points against. If we win against Villa and Everton, our last 2 games of the season, we should be able to secure a CL spot and hopefully get Mou back.

true,kishen_r,silence,Silence,"Not one of my favourite episodes. So many things that didn't seem quite ""right"".

Here's a collection of thoughts on today's episode. Maybe I'll edit it in future to make them a bit coherant, but we'll see:

- The TARDIS translation matrix didn't kick in. No reason was given.
- Where did the Doctor disappear to just before Clara met Mary? I would have expected some big reveal towards the end about how the Doctor had been planning it all along.
- We were forced to watch them singing a song - this would have been fine if it had sounded distinctly alien. Instead, they went with a human sounding song, which meant that I spent ages trying to figure out if they were singing in English. I gave up, only to find that the man's song was English after all.
- Mary was running away from her fellow monks, and they seemed quite unfriendly people. But then they seemed perfectly friendly when Mary walked back to them.
- The alien ""minders"" (forgotten what they were called) could have played a bigger part. They could have been chasing Mary at the beginning, and were much scarier.
- Clara's history was pretty useless. It basically just showed the Doctor stalking two people, and acting like a bit of a creep. 
- The leaf should have been introduced gradually over a couple of episodes, before being given such a pivotal role in ""saving the day"".
- Instead, it seemed that the 5 minute intro to Clara's history was only included to bring in the leaf reference. Made the whole story a bit too ""easy"" to piece together.
- Gradually learning about Clara's history and birth would have been far more interesting, rather than being given a crash course in 5 minutes.
- Why are we seeing so much of the ""101 places to go and see"" book? It's clearly an important artifact - we get it. Overkill.
- A much more interesting end to the story might have been to see the doctor sacrifice Clara, in the knowledge that he could find another ""version"" of her. Much darker ending, but far more in keeping with the ""scary"" nature of Doctor 

Edit, to add more points:

- The Doctor's speech was awesome and brought back a lot of memories and continuity points. But coming after a very dull and muted run-up to the battle, it lacked the impact that it deserved.
- The vampire thing was a bit useless - it writhed around in a glass box for a bit, then broke the window and died straight after. They could have had a Doctor vs Vampire fight, with Clara/Mary then finding a solution to killing the monster.
- Unclear what, if any, memories the doctor lost. Seems like it was contrived for a specific reason, which we'll see in future weeks. But again, they could have done a much more visual thing (flashbacks/stills?), rather than wavy lines of yellow light, which seem to be the series' go-to visual effect these days.
- He mentioned one memory that would kill off a parasitic god, but clearly that didn't have any effect.",0,1365273454,null,0,1365274003,0,c99sfoj,t3_1bt1fd,t1_c99sfoj,t3_1bt1fd,null,1431651191,172,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,172

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"1. 10th Doctor, Blink. Sometime before Matt Smith and after David Tennant, so early 2010 probably.

2. Seventh.

3. Not really because there are hundreds and I would then have to drag the audios and books into this. But least favorite? The Space Pirates is probably one of them.

4. Favorites...Evelyn Smythe, Sarah-Jane Smith, Ace McShane, Hex (Thomas Hector Schofield), Susan Foreman, Donna Noble, Romana II (but as President).

5. Davros, hands down. No contest.

6. Yes, 9 and 6 mostly. Generally all classic Doctors are underappreciated except 4.

7. I don't think it should've but I'm glad it did. Or else everything wouldn't be like it is today.

8. I hated it at first. But the more I watch it the more I love it. It's just really 90s is all. And it didn't get a lot of things wrong. But of what it did get wrong, they got realllyyyy wrong.

9. Wasn't a fan then.

10. I think the new ones are very different from the old ones but they both maintain the spirit of the show. But that's only my interpretation of what Doctor Who should be like. They both fulfill this role imo. Continuity-wise, you don't even need to compare both versions to find tons of contradictions so don't even bother with that.

11. I met Sylvester McCoy, the seventh Doctor. He was a funny, sharp and witty guy and extremely down to Earth. Great guy.

12. I've no idea but I'd like it to run forever please.

13. Moffat and RTD eras...different things. I think RTD focused more on character development and people. I think Moffat focuses on mysterious arcs that often involve complex time travel. Moffat is always trying to make sure the show doesn't get boring or stale and does a good job of it. RTD likes to explore companions' growth from when they first meet the Doctor to the end. His companions started off as normal people who, through their time with the Doctor, grow up and save the earth in their finales. In Moffat Who the companions are often the center of a space-time mystery themselves which the Doctor figures out.

14. I think it's yet another addition and confirmation of Doctor Who's cultural importance. And I'm sure non-Who fans in Britain are sick of hearing about it lol

15. I'm excited about it. I've been following all the spoilers and announcements. I don't hope for much because I don't want to disappoint myself. I just want it to be a good story. Though, having Doctors from pre-2005 would make it feel less like an ""8th Anniversary"" if you know what I mean.

true,YOU_STEP_ON_LEGO,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I'll answer your questions but I don't know how useful my answers will be because i'm not great at going into detail.

**Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?**


I started watching Doctor Who in 2005 when the series was rebooted, and the Doctor at that time was Christopher Eccleston.  

**Do you have a favourite Doctor?**

Matt Smith has done a brilliant job of playing as the Doctor so far, but my favourite Doctor has to be David Tennant who did an excellent job of portraying the Doctor. 

**Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?**

The Sound of Drums. 

**Favourite companion?**

Jenna-Louise Coleman (Clara Oswin) for her looks. Best companion has to go to Billie Piper (Rose) as her storyline was awesome. 

**Favourite enemy?**

The Silence.

**Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?**

I don't know how others feel but Christopher Eccleston was way under-appreciated in my opinion and it seems that everyone has pretty much forgot about him. 

**Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?**

I don't really have an opinion on this.

**What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?**

I didn't watch it.

**How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?**

I wasn't a fan then so it was my friend that introduced me to the series but he was ecstatic that it was returning! 

**Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?**


**Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?**

Nope, but i'd love to meet Jenna Coleman! (Clara).
 
**How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?**

I'd like it to run forever! I have heard that it'll be finishing up soon though.

Sorry i'll have to get back to you for the last few questions. ",0,1365275639,null,0,false,0,c99t3vk,t3_1bt2br,t1_c99t3vk,t3_1bt2br,null,1431650875,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

7. Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s? When I look at the classic episodes they're good but nothing in comparison to what they are today. But I think this is because a lot more effort was put in. So yes, I'm glad it was cancelled then brought back.

8. Never seen it. But I will now!

9. How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005? I was very excited, I didn't exactly what it was at first being fairly young but when I watched a few classic episodes online it got me more excited.

10. The new version does have the same type of excitement as I am sure was with the original audience. But both have lots of contradictions however I never usually notice.

11. I've met Elisabeth Sladen in 2006.

12. How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for? I think that there should be another 2 or 3 new Doctors before they re cancel the series for another comeback in 30 years. It feels like tradition now :P But if I had my way it would never end.

13. I personally prefer Russell T Davies's series because I feel that they have more depth. But both have their good qualities.

14. I think it will bring more people together because of the wide audience it reaches, the BBC will probably push this as much as they can as they know this. The British have a huge thing for anniversaries so this will come out and bring out a lot of fake Whovians in people.

15. I am very very very excited. I am hoping for the reunion so much and I have a bet going for what enemy will be the focus of the episode.

2. Yes, 4th and 10th. I simply cannot pick which one I like more.

3. Journey's End and Vincent and the Doctor are my favorites, and I can't think of an episode that I don't like now. I remember I hated David Tennats leaving but I got over that pretty quick.

4. Rose Tyler and Donna Noble

5. The Silence and the Sontarians

6. No I don't think so. I think everyone learns to love the Doctor, doesn't matter which one but he always grows on you. 

7. Yes, I think maybe otherwise the series wouldn't be as popular today.

10. Uhm I haven't seen all the old ones, so many are lost and some are in so bad quality that I simply couln't make my self watch, But from what I've seen, yes. They follow the old rules most of the time and are bringing back old enemies and old friends and I really like that.

12. I would like it to run forever! But like everything it has to end someday and I think it's gonna happend sooner than many people would like.

14. I really didn't see the change of course like many Whovians. I love them both!

16. Yeah! I think every Whovian is excited! I really try to avoid spoilers but I think that as it draws closer and people start notice them shooting the episode it gets harder to avoid these things! but right now I don't know anything.

The biggest one is that supporter groups are supposed to represent the best interests of the club.  Supporter groups are there to represent the best interests of the supporters.  The quaint notion that the two are the same went out of the window about 20 years ago, and was further reinforced when Chelsea tried to use underhanded tricks to get the CPO to relinquish the freehold of the pitch back to the club.  The idea that we're supposed to follow the company line like good little soldiers is so naive, it can only come from someone who has never actually dealt with Chelsea bureaucracy before.  

No, what we ACTUALLY try to do is to enable the supporters to support their club despite Chelsea making it really hard to do so. Whether navigating the ticket fiasco that Chelsea presented us with last summer (Which TheIndieArmy is right, was a complete clusterfuck. Where he is wrong, however, is in suggesting that any of it was our fault), or for the STL game when Chelsea gave us a very limited amount of time to sell our allotment of tickets and forced us to advertise their availability publicly, causing many CIA members who signed up and requested tickets from us in advance, to not get them.

Now, in spite of the fact that I personally have 0 problems butting heads with the club when it comes to doing right by the supporters, that's not actually happening here.  We're not doing anything that Chelsea told us not to do.  Your whole post is a massive overreaction to what is an inconsequential event. Yes, people have been asked not to publicize this because we actually want people to be able to get their tickets this time around, and because it's (clearly) not amazing publicity for this to get out.  But you're acting like you've caught us planting dynamite under Stamford Bridge, when in fact, this sort of thing happens all the time.

Edit: Oh, and as a personal, and mostly irrelevant aside, I continue to be disappointed in this community. 3 days ago, I came on this subreddit, and tried to help people here get tickets to STL.  Why did I need to do this?  Because Chelsea once again showed that they don't give 2 shits about getting tickets to the people who are actual passionate fans.

It cannot, particularly to the period where Amy and Rory are, and it was previously believed that it couldn't go to the date in ""Utopia,"" although an almost impossible being forced it to in an attempt to shake it off, which brings us back full circle to Jack.

* Instant noodles - ~13p a packet, pretty delicious if you crack an egg, have some frozen veg in there too, great for a lunch on the go

* Instant pancake mix - 8p a packet, add water and an egg, you can have a decent breakfast and be lazy at the same time.

* Most of the frozen section except the meat. Chips, veg, all sorts of potato bits and bobs - cheap and great for filling out a meal. The meat? Tends to be horrible concoction of fat and flavourings that might as well have been scraped from an uncleaned grill. Bleugh.

Recommend if you're struggling

* Value beans + a bit of butter (added into the sauce while heating, make it taste a bit better) + value bread: Decent amount of beans on toast for approximately 33p, a meal that I hear you can live off entirely for extended periods of time. The bread's variable in taste depending on luck, but it's all the same as toast. The butter's added in because the sauce is a bit meh, makes it easier.

Avoid:

* Microwave/instant meals and ready-to-cook pizzas: The portion sizes of value instant meals are always a little small for me, and they're not the kind of thing I'd want to eat more than one of in a day. The pizzas are far too expensive for what they are, and you can get some frozen, brand-name pizzas for a lot cheaper

* Anything tinned with pasta and sauce - Ravioli, Mac and Cheese - all pretty revolting.

true,paulutk,1953,null,"&gt;First off, some of you may not think this is a big deal, but as a lover of the blues, whenever someone does something like this I take it to heart.
&gt;It's come to my attention that the supporter group Chelsea in America (the group) is selling tickets to the unannounced NY match in May behind Chelsea's (the club) back.

Nope, not behind the club's back.  The club doesn't sell the tickets.  We aren't selling their tickets.  We are buying tickets and selling them to our members.

&gt; They have gone so far as instructed their members not to disclose this information in fear it will jeopardize their chances for future match tickets, and get their tickets for NY revoke.

Not the reason we are asking members not disclose.  There are a limited number of tickets and we want CIA members to get access to them first before we open it up to the general Chelsea fans who aren't paid supporters of CIA.

&gt;My question is, why are they doing this if they know the club won't like it? You are a supporter group for the club. You are suppose to love everything Chelsea and want what is best for them first and foremost, even above yourself. Why would you go out of your way to do something you fear they won't like?
&gt;Furthermore, why would you drag all of your members into this as well? It is not fair that your members may suffer the consequences of poor choices made by group administration. Here is a novel idea, why don't you just wait until public tickets go on sale to sell yours? What is the point of selling them a few days early if the club doesn't want you to? or, if you want to sell them early, why not ask the club to do so first?

The point is to so that we can gauge what are demand is for the ticket allotment to see if we can request more.  We sold out of our allotment in St. Louis in less than 24 hours.  We don't want that to happen again if we can avoid it.  We only had 7 weeks to get this together and organized and we are all just volunteers.

&gt;For those wondering, the comments (some now deleted) in this thread[1] are what initially brought this to light.
&gt;Also, I've managed to get a copy of the entire email from a group member for you to see exactly what they are sending their members and how they are instructing them not to make this information public in fear it will reach the club. It might be hard to read on a mobile. http://i.imgur.com/fvXQluU.png [2]

No, not the club, we don't want it to get to non CIA members.

&gt;Lastly, I want to point out a forum post[3] over at CIA's website discussing this. They have started a manhunt to find out who is leaking information, going so far as saying they are the ones that will possibly ruin it for everyone else. NO, CIA! Your administrators who made the choice to sell tickets early behind Chelsea's back will be the only ones responsible for the actions they chose. No one else. How dare you insist that you'll make one of your members feel guilty for putting their passion for the club over your group.

Again, you miss the point entirely...

&gt;Maybe I'm taking this too far, but again, I'm passionate for my club and when something like this happens it hits a bit of a nerve. They say that keeping secrets can be a form of lying and I certain don't appreciate it when someone keeps secrets and lies to my club.
&gt;This isn't right and Chelsea in America should be ashamed of themselves.
&gt;Please upvote for visibility as I receive no karma for this self post. Undoubtedly CIA will try to downvote this to further hide their secrets. Let's not let them do that.

true,everworld2662,null,null,"Guess who this is. Go on. Guess.

**Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?**
Eccleston/Nine. As for when, I'm pretty sure it was when Tennant started, so I guess 2005!

**Do you have a favourite Doctor?**
5 for Classic, 11 for New, although if Moffat continues writing the way he is I may have to revise that opinion.

**Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?**
Favourites: *Girl in the Fireplace*, *Silence in the Library* &amp; *Forest of the Dead*
Least-favourites: JFC where do I even begin with this. Actually wait no probably *The Doctor's Daughter*. NO, wait, *The End of Time*. Definitely *The End of Time*.

**Favourite companion?**
Tricky! Old: Tegan. TEGAN TEGAN TEGAN. New: ...*tricky*. I kind of love all of them (-Clara because Moffat.)

**Favourite enemy?**
TBH none of them have been very compelling/interesting/developed? I guess the Master gets point for being the most 3D one I can't think of off the top of my head.

**Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?**
5! But then I am biased~

**Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?**
I don't feel I can weigh in on this one given when I started watching!

**What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?**
Haven't seen it! /shame

**How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?**
Well...excited to try this new thing? XD

**Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?**
Not particularly tbh. Tonally they're *so incredibly different*. And watching them...they feel like two different shows. 

**Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?**
Nein.

**How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?**
How long I think it will run: I think it might be dying again actually? That said these things die hard, so shall we say...5 more years, at least? &amp; even if it dies I don't think it will *die*; I imagine it'll get rebooted/continue in movie form/continue as comics/whatever. It's never going to die.
How long I would like it to run for: forever really. Even if it's crap I don't have to watch it, and that's better than not having the option at all. They just need to change showrunner like every 2 years. That'd improve things.

**What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies?**
You really don't want to hear this rant. I hated RTD in his last season, loved Moff in his first, now hate him much, much more than I ever hated RTD. The man has an ego larger than the galaxy and it shows in his repulsively lazy, disrespectful writing in recent seasons. ...um, anyway, more broadly I would say (&amp; have seen lots of people say) that Moffat's era is focussed on plot &amp; themes, while RTD's was about characters &amp; emotions. RTD at his bad points was horribly sentimentalist and nonsensical; at his good points, genuinely moving/character-driven. Moff's good points where thematic consistency, beautiful imagery, cinematography (!), metaphor. Bad points were ~~everything after his first season~~ overly ""zany"" plots, total lack of character development/dimensionality, and ignoring emotional consequences for characters (here Amy, have a baby!).  

**What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?**
It's exciting! But I'm not sure I'm the best one to comment on British culture &amp; television? From an outsider's perspective all I can think of is ""Moff don't fucking screw this up"" -- so not helpful.

**Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?**
Honestly I'm not, and I don't? My expectation is really that it's going to be a ""pandering"" episode, like all the Christmas ones, so I don't expect it to have any story substance/be very well written. Rather I expect it'll try to pack in everything it thinks fans want a the expense of coherence or substance. But I am pessimistic.

Technically I think my first Doctor was the Fifth - my friend showed me a clip before Nine's series started. But in reality I first started watching with the Ninth Doctor, *Rose*, as did most of the new audience in Britain, I feel!

**Do you have a favourite Doctor?**

Yes. The Eleventh Doctor is the one that I feel most strongly about. I can enjoy, love and appreciate all the other Doctors, but I feel so incredibly attached to Eleven. His mannerisms, childlike wonder, old age and his staggering ability to do speeches make me certain he is my Doctor.

**Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?**

This is tough, I don't really think in terms of least favourite, because I have genuinely enjoyed every episode of Doctor Who I have seen so far. Even if people assume it's rubbish, I can see the good in them all.

But favourite? It depends what mood I'm in, and is it the episode I think most encapsulates Doctor Who? Or just one that I enjoy the most? Here's a few and my reasons:

Midnight - frighteningly good, it shows the Doctor as vulnerable and for once he is not instantly trusted by those who are around him. Instead, his mysterious nature is a negative against him. Brilliant acting. Atmospheric. Mysterious. I like the fact that we never see the Midnight Entity or even know what it wanted. There's something far more sinister in that unknown.

The Eleventh Hour - fan-bloody-tastic. An excellent episode that explains what Doctor Who is all about, introduces a great new Doctor and characters, but all the while maintaining an entertaining story with some brilliant wit and humour.

**Favourite companion?**

Ian Chesterton, Barbara Wright, Sarah Jane Smith, Donna Noble, Rory Williams. Can't choose between them, I'm afraid. I love them all for various reasons and the roles they played.

**Favourite enemy?**

Bit of a repeat here, but probably the Midnight Entity. Like I said above, there's something so utterly cold and sinister about it.

**Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?**

I'll let you know when I've watched them all. :)

**Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?**

I haven't actually seen those episodes, so I can't make a judgement call on the quality of that and whether cancelling was reasonable and rational or unreasonable and irrational.

However, with the benefit of hindsight, Doctor Who is about change. Maybe it had stagnated, and maybe cancelling for a few years gave it a chance to catch its breath and get back on its feet.

**What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?**

I really should get around to watching that...

**How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?**

Elated and excited. This was the show that my parents and older siblings enjoyed when they were young. I made LEGO Daleks before I'd even watched an episode. And quite frankly, back in 2005, I was just pleased to have more sci-fi back on the TV. Farscape's cancellation was still raw with me, and Doctor Who jumped in to fill that gap in my heart.

**Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?**

Yes. I think RTD, Moffat and the various other writers have balanced it perfectly. They do enough references and history to ensure that it is one big series, without it becoming utterly fan service-y and alienating new viewers. I'm sure the 50th anniversary will be one big fan service, but I think the fans and writers deserve that one indulgence.

**Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?**

Yes. I met Tracie Simpson at the London Film and Comic Con (8). She was a lovely woman, and when I went up, the guy before me in the queue had whined at her for 5 minutes about what he didn't like about the new Doctor Who. She was amazingly diplomatic and honestly a lovely, delightful person. The highlight of my visit.

**How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?**

Oh gosh, without being completely indulgent, I hope it runs forever. Not continuously, though. As I said before, Doctor Who is about change, and it may be that one day it will need to take another breather, to allow the next generation of writers/producers/directors to step up to the plate and give it a new direction, and new feel.

**What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?**

They are different. I don't prefer one to the other. They have their own strengths, their own weaknesses and to compare is utterly silly. Moffat and RTD are big boys, their creative vision can stand on its own feet and prove itself without being compared to the other sibling.

**What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?**

It's odd, I want it to mean *a lot*, but I'm also aware that while Doctor Who may have fairly large audience shares, it is not always the most popular show for normal people. Especially as those who watched it before, don't watch modern Who. But then, you don't need that to mean anything. I think the 50th anniversary will remind people of how far television has come.

I'm hoping the 50th anniversary will add more to British culture, as Doctor Who is such a... staple. A constant. I hope that more will be added to the classics of Daleks and Cybermen and police boxes.

**Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?**

I avoid spoilers. And I am ridiculously, utterly wetting myself for the episode.

9th doctor, about 2-3 years ago in 7th grade
Do you have a favourite Doctor?
Yes, 10th Doctor David Tennant
Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?
Favorite- probly Amy's choice or Asylum of the Daleks
Least- The power of three
Favourite companion?
The Ponds
Favourite enemy?
Daleks
Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?
9th, he was a great doctor. We just didn't get to see alot of him
Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?
Not at all
What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?
I think it's awful, the show has been on fir 50 years, there's no way it will live up to the show
How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?
I never watched the classics 
Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?
Very well
Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?
Nope, but I hope that I will someday :)
How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?
Not sure, I'd say forever, but if it gets bad they should and people don't like it anymore they should conclude it
What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?
Moffat can be a great writer, but I always liked Russell's scripts
What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?
It marks the date on a TV show that has been with British culture for many years

Does the Doc still have the memories and sorrows he was describing to the 'Old God'? - it was implying that the beast was absorbing them, but not confirmed.

I thought the acting and the ideas were good, especially towards the end, and though the song motif is a really novel idea, in execution it was a little painful to listen to.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"Couple of thoughts about this episode:

- I liked the singing bits. Yes, they were cheesy, but they were pleasing to my ears.

- During the 'you came into existence from the elements that came from an exploding star' talk, I was on the edge of my seat because if he'd ended that speech with 'and so you see, you are stardust', I would've probably started throwing things. 

- The episode had an interesting concept, but somehow felt weak. The conversation between Clara and the Doctor could've been better, more enthusiastic, more interesting, more substantial, more...existing. Clara from this episode was a very watered-down Clara from the previous one and I hope this doesn't continue in the future.

- The sonic screwdriver thing has got to stop. Seriously, I know it's supposed to be a useful little device, but it's not a laser forcefield anti-psychic blast countering, freakishly heavy weight-lifting wonder-wand +12. It has single-handedly solved one too many plots. 

- Clara is adorable. 

- I love the Doctor's new outfit. 

- Seemed like lots of emphasis was put on mentioning grandaughters and grandfathers? Susan? Maybe? I'm kind of dreading it might turn out Clara is Susan because a) the reason will have to be 'timey-wimey technobabble' b) it would make all the flirting from the previous episode so weird, I mean seriously, people. Still, that would be worst-case scenario - if it does turn out to be significant, it'll probably be something they're setting up for the big 5-0. 

- TARDIS ""not liking"" Clara WILL be some form of plot-point.

So we have a second arc this season. Clara brings him back to the TARDIS and he's all beat up. The Doctor doesn't recognize the TARDIS or the box and doesn't know how to use it. But for the remaining episodes the TARDIS just takes them where they need to be (just like the first doctor). It's harder for him to save people and things without his memory or knowledge of technology....maybe he isn't able to save the day a few times. But his cleverness prevails.

His lesbian friends would bump into him and Clara. They would be shocked to see Clara again because they only recognize the Victorian Clara. But they would be more shocked to see a Doctor unfamiliar with himself and themselves. I'm sure the Doctor would be untrustworthy of anyone calling themselves ""friend"". Maybe he gets duped at some point by an old enemy.

Then Trenzalor. Great battle ensues. The Doctor's memory is returned (or partially). Clara's arc is resolved. And maybe we don't even need to say his real name.

However, I don't think it's about why the culture is like that and more to do with what the culture is. I don't think any one in Afghan is to blame for the culture that's been forced upon them. They didn't choose it, they had no other choice but to adopt this culture of unpleasantness. 

What matters is that this culture is unpleasant. That the culture there does support and prop up horrible things. People there are indoctrinated into these ways.

true,chadwini,null,null,"I'd be delighted with mid table and a cup run next season. A combination of second season syndrome and at some point MoPo's system being found out (clubs haven't had that much time to work out how to play it yet) make me not ask for any higher. 

I think we might be in the market for a wide player. Punch did really well first half of the season but, not for the first time, as soon as he signed that contract his performances dropped and he hasn't been playing that much. Not sure MoPo rates him. Also seeing how good Rodriguez has been up front, think we need more cover our wide anyway.

We've been lucky with injuries this season (Lallana aside) so could do with a bit of depth in some areas. I don't trust Danny Fox even as our reserve left back and would like to get rid of Hooiveld. Bringing in one more quality CB would give us 4 (not including Hooiveld). That would give us a good bit of cover (Maya covering full backs).

So if he found the tumblers, that would have made the key changing pointless, as otherwise the sonic would only have lifted the door for about 1/10 squillionth of a second before the key changed. So the sonic unlocked it, and then pushed it open. I don't understand it at all, and I don't think the writer did either.

What I would really appreciate is an episode dedicated to the sonic screwdriver; really delve deep into its workings and how the doctor can manipulate everything with it (except wood).

Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?
Eccleston, first new episode. My parents made me watch it and I was excited, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. Then the theme tune started and I knew I was going to be a lifelong fan immediately. It's just so damn catchy. 

Do you have a favourite Doctor?
Tennant. Eccleston was good but too dark, Smith is good but too light, Tennant dominated light, dark and everything in between. I wish I could appreciate the old doctors more but I haven't started watching the old episodes yet. 

Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?
Blink. That was the first episode where I really thought about the effect the Doctor has on people's lives, and it was beautifully terrifying. Least favourite is tough to say as there's been a few iffy ones, but I love them all in their own way. 

Favourite companion?
Martha, then Amy. Probably because I'm in love with them both. 

Favourite enemy?
I want to say the weeping angels, but they're more of a concept than a character, so it's got to be The Master. I find that the best enemies in everything are the ones that are merely reflections of the main heroes. 

Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?
Smith. A lot of people like him, but a lot of people think he's a bit too flamboyant and childish, especially towards the beginning of his run. I think he brought something to the role that was very much needed. 

Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?
I can't really say as I haven't watched the old series, but I suppose I'm glad that it was able to come back fresh, with new ideas. 

What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?
Still haven't seen it, shamefully.

How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?
Like I said above, I didn't know what the fuss was about until I started watching.

Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?
Definitely. It's a wonderful bonding moment when my parents have to explain the old references to me, though I always end up explaining the new episodes to them. 

Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?
Nope.

How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?
Last night's episode, with the speech about how life is created from stars and not gods, made me realise how important this show is. An entire generation of young whovians will now know that, and hopefully some of those will be inspired to explore science and the stars because of it. I hope this show will continue to inspire and drive progress long after I stop watching, which means long after I'm dead. 

What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?
They're each different, neither is better. Moffat's writing does make me smile a bit more though. 

What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?
It would mean more if it was never cancelled, but it's still a big milestone. Let's put it this way, if I had to choose between the Queen and Doctor Who, I'd be sent to jail for treason. 

Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?
I'm excited to see what Moffat really has up his sleeve. ",0,1365293470,null,0,false,0,c99ya27,t3_1bt2br,t1_c99ya27,t3_1bt2br,null,1431648366,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

With secured lending the loan agreement grants the lender powers to repossess and sell your home without a court order if you are behind on payments.  Although lenders do not have to go to court they always do in practice.  (Not going to court looks bad, risks Article 8 HRA challenges, etc.).

With unsecured lending the lender has no automatic right to repossess and sell your home.  If they want to force you to sell your home they must always get a court order to do so.  Courts are unlikely to force the sale of your home if the debts are small.  

Despite the scaremongering tone of this article I doubt much has changed on this.  The new legislation just makes it easier for lenders to get a charge on the property, not easier to force a sale.

And, frankly, the entire situation seems a little bizarre. I find it very difficult to imagine that a home owner would be entirely unable to scrape together £1,000 in assets. And if they can't, and own their own house, it's probably quite prudent to downsize a little rather than continuing to default on that payment. The fact that of 81,000 charging orders in 2011, only 400 sales were forced suggests that this is really quite an effective way of making people realise that maybe they can actually afford to pay back that debt.

That said, I think it's a pretty bad move because lenders - especially credit card/pay-day - are doing quite aright as is, and I'm extremely doubtful we'll see the reduced risk passed onto consumers with lower rates.

true,Cold_Kneeling,null,null,"Firstly I'll apologise because I am perfectly aware of my affliction of non-conciseness, but here we go anyway.

1. I'm only 19 but the first Doctor I ever saw was William Hartnell - my dad started bringing the DVDs home a couple of years before the series returned in 2005, so my first episode was The Dalek Invasion of Earth. Nevertheless when asked who my doctor is I tend to say Christopher Eccleston  or David Tennant, because the 2005 season was the first one I watched faithfully and as it first aired.

2. I tend to panic when people ask me who my favourite doctor is, so I've given this one a lot of thought so as to prepare me for those moments. I think my favourite doctors are joint - David Tennant and Patrick Troughton, but most of them are pretty close behind. I don't think you can have a best doctor though, because all of the doctors *were* the Doctor. It's not like James Bond where you have to have the personality the same, however much I dislike Colin Baker's version (for example), that was undeniably who the Doctor was at that point in his history. He was as much the Doctor as any of the others, and therefore his doctor was as good a doctor as any of the others.

3. My favourite companions are joint too - Jamie McCrimmon and Donna Noble, and for similar reasons. They both take on a special, 'best-friend' relationship with the Doctor rather than a romantic one like Rose or a basic doctor-companion one. I like watching that play out, and because I get far too involved in the emotions of the show (which is of course the only real way to watch the show :P) I like the characters that understand and reach out to the Doctor the most; the ones that make him happiest and most secure. In my eyes that's Donna and Jamie.

4. *spoilers for the 50th in this one, just to warn the casual reader* My favourite enemy is the zygons. There's no real deep reason why - I think it was just that they were linked to Nessie and I've always had a bit of a fascination with Loch Ness. You should have seen me when I saw the announcement about the 50th, I almost exploded with excitement. I also love the idea behind the Vashta Nerada - I think that was really innovative, making the scary thing about the dark the dark itself. Also cured me of my nictophobia, I realised that if the Vashta Nerada were what I should be scared of, the I had nothing to fear - if they were here, I'd be dead already, so I must be safe. Ta da. :P

5. I think the eighth Doctor gets a lot of bad press because of his short reign, so to speak, and lots of things about the film that I'll get to in a minute. He actually does a fantastic job at capturing the energy, the tenderness and the wild, madcap exuberance of the Doctor (I think) in a less-than-inspiring film. The eighth Doctor is essentially the sole reason I watch the movie. He's one of my favourite Doctors despite my dislike of his co-stars and the film's plotline.

6. You know of my appreciation bordering on fangirl-y love of Paul McGann's Doctor, so I'll leave that aside. Grace rates as one of my most annoying companions of all time, though she has her moments of (no pun intended) grace. I thought the Doctor's regeneration was a bit over-dramatised and I felt like there were religious undertones to it that didn't need to be there; having said that I did like *why* he regenerated. I thought the fact that he died from human surgeons trying to help him was a clever way to do it, and highlighted the dangers of the Doctor wandering around 20th/21st Century Earth. I decidedly did not like the Master in the film. He was like a bad parody of Dracula and the Terminator's lovechild. The Master in most of his guises is my absolute favourite character of Doctor Who and I praise him from Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley (my personal favourite) to John Simm and Derek Jacobi's ever-so-important job of bringing him back to life after the Time War, but Eric Roberts did not do it for me. he needed to be more nonchalant, more sarky and charismatic. He did charisma in an oily dracula way - trying to show that characters in the film took him to be charismatic but without bothering to charm the audience in the way that John Simm and Anthony Ainley could do so well. I'll stop now before I give you an entire essay on the subject, but you get the idea. As I said before though, the film was saved by Paul McGann's portrayal of the Doctor.

7. Gonna pretty much pass this one as I was pretty young. I'm surprised that I can't remember, because I know I was pretty invested in it from watching the classic series with my family when I heard the news, and I know I was already enough of a fan to fight tooth and claw (also no pun intended) with my parents to let me watch The Unquiet Dead (third episode in) when they thought it was too scary but... I can't remember any sense of surprise or jubilation at the news. Maybe I was just so young I didn't realise how unusual it was for shows to restart.",0,1365296956,null,0,1365297337,0,c99z9tl,t3_1bt2br,t1_c99z9tl,t3_1bt2br,null,1431647897,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I definitely jump up in happiness at the references in the new series along with the best of them, and me and my brother do a genuine screaming dance of enthusiasm round the living room when anyone as big as Davros or the Master reappears. But I have to say it doesn't feel smooth. It feels slightly awkward, like the writers are desperate to show that the two link up, rather than are concentrating on only mentioning things when it makes sense to the Doctor for them to be mentioned. I suspect many would disagree with me but that's how it seems to me. I think RTD was better at inserting references smoothly and subtly, but Steven Moffat is more eager/willing to actually put the references in. There are some things about 'new who' that I know go directly against the old ideas of the show - like the no kissing rule or similar the fact that the Doctor was originally envisioned as an asexual character (as in no romantic stuff, not genderless), but I started my Whovian journey with Rose on board, so I can't find it in my soul to condemn that.

9. I met Colin Baker at a little Doctor Who exhibition in Cambridge about a year ago? Two years ago? I have to admit that despite my immense Doctor Who fan-ness he didn't make much of an impression on me. He seemed a nice chap, had a pretty long conversation with my grandad and they seemed to get along, but as I have mentioned he's not exactly my favourite Doctor and any excitement I felt at seeing him was essentially because of his association to the show rather than his involvement in it. Nevertheless it was a little surreal to know that a guy who had been the Doctor was a few feet away sharing jokes with my grandparents.

10. FOR EVER -*crazy eyes*-

But honestly, I hope it's around for a good long time yet. I'd love to be sitting down with my children, twenty years from now on another saturday evening preparing for the sound of TARDIS engines. I think it has a better chance than most shows - for one thing, now RTD has done such a wonderful job of bringing it back from the dead, no other cancellation of it will ever be seen as total annihilation. Fans will always (I hope) be at least slightly waiting for another RTD to take up the reins. Similarly since it worked so well and brought in so much money in 2005 I expect an attempt to revive it if it ever crashes again will be fairly easily accepted by whatever broadcasting company the idea is put to. Another reason I think it's got a chance I like to call my 'James Bond Theory', because both franchise have hit on a very good survival technique - that the show can continue in the same strength even if all the main actors leave. I think that will carry Doctor Who (and James Bond) a good long way into the future: in theory it gives both the option of being infinite, as long as there are sapient beings to play the roles.

11. [&lt;-- I can't get this to say 11 for some reason :3] I'm not going to lie, I'm a Russel T. Davis girl through and through. There's a certain 2D, childish quality to Steven Moffat's seasons that just doesn't click with me in the same way as RTD's style. I also feel like seasons 1-4 (and the specials) just had a more... polished quality to them than 5-8. I think a big reason for this is just that RTD was such a perfectionist, which is a trait about him and his writing that appeals to me. It's just back then... I don't know, the CGI was as good as they could get it, the support actors were brilliantly skilled despite their small roles and the sets were dressed to perfection. Nothing was basic when making it more complicated could make it more realistic. Just compare the CGI of London in the blitz from Rose's barrage balloon affair in *The Empty Child* to when the Daleks turn on London's lights in *Victory of the Daleks* for example. Also I am in love with authors and screenwriters who can hide long-term plot points in amongst the backdrop of others stories. Something as subtle as JK Rowling putting Slytherin's locket in the cabinet that Harry is cleaning in Grimmauld place almost half a book before you need to know about it. RTD was a master at that. I didn't catch Bad Wolf at all until the Doctor pointed it out, I only slightly twigged that 'Mr. Saxon' must be important because he was ordering the attack on the Racnoss ship and doing a statement for the news when Martha's hospital vanished, but Steven Moffat... you can tell he's trying, with the crack in the wall and the 'silence will fall' but he just doesn't have the knack of getting things hidden and subtle. Also Moffat seems to think Doctor Who is about making it other things - 'the scariest possible' and 'a real blockbuster episode' spring to mind, whereas RTD and Terrance Dicks and all the greats of Doctor Who writing have always made it their mission to make the show as 'Doctor Who' as it can be, and I think that's what's made it such an icon. It shouldn't *be* a hollywood-style, all-guns-blazing, this-will-be-my-most-terrifying-ever, blockbuster feature-length special. It should be Doctor Who.

Having said that I think you'd be hard pressed to find a man with an imagination to equal Moffat's in the English-speaking world, and he has written my favourite Doctor Who eps of all time (the Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead duo). When he's concentrating, he can do beautiful works of art in storytelling - as subtle and touching and hard-hitting and dramatic and as anything as he wants them. I think most of what I get annoyed at him for is because the poor man is trying to put together entire serieses for two different award-winning shows (DW and Sherlock) and just doesn't have time to do everything up to his highest standard.

I went through a secondary school where everybody knew of Doctor Who and most people watched it - back then I would have said it was momentous, a celebration of the success of something quintessentially British and one of the most popular and iconic shows around, a really proud moment for British culture and television where we could show our baby to the rest of the world and go 'Marvel at it's awesomeness! Harry Potter and now 50 years of Doctor Who? Aren't we just a little bit epic?'. Then I was thrown into a sixth form where suddenly I was having to explain to people what 'regeneration' meant, where my new friends drew TARDISes without the right number of panels and didn't even include the sign at the top. It was a strange world that humbled me into believing that I was actually part of a niche, nerdy world, and that most the population even in Britain didn't care about the Time Lord and the show's messages that were of huge significance to me. Then I would have said 'It's momentous for whovians across the world, and it feels good to know it started here and that my small by enthusiastic and friendly community is taking at least a peek at British culture to see where it all came from right now'. Having seen the start of the celebrations... I'm not sure. The BBC is commissioning docudramas, 50th anniversary spoilers are front page news, the British Film Institute has huge Doctor Who posters up (so I'm told) and if that wasn't enough, real Daleks are invading the bridges of London right out of my first episode. So now I'm confused - I'm wary about my first response, and I think my second was overcorrected. I think that the British film and television industry will see this as momentous, especially following Harry Potter and James Bond's recent 50th. I think it's something that we in the fandoms and those in the industry will celebrate and be proud of together, but I can't tell how far it will inspire people outside Britain to take a look at our culture. I certainly don't think it will prompt us to change anything - without wishing to come across as too much of a patriot (believe me any patriotism does simply spring from Doctor Who and Harry Potter), we seem to be on to a good thing in our television. I think more than anything the 5oth will serve to remind us of that. Like I said, a celebration, not a call to change.

13. *spoilers for the 50th in this paragraph too* Are you mad? Of course I'm excited! There's my favourite Doctor and my favourite monsters and it's an enormous celebration for one of the most important stories to me in the world (a phrase that links up nicely with tonight's episode - a lot of the 'atoms' of my soul are TARDIS blue). I don't have a policy with spoilers - for David Tennant's finale I kept religiously away from any news unless it was reported by the BBC and I therefore deemed it a 'legal' spoiler, but right now I'm spiritedly attempting to keep abreast of every rumour, interview allusion and press release that pops out of the shroud of anniversary secrecy. I'm not going to attempt to describe what I know because I haven't mastered the spoiler-hiding thingymabob on reddit yet and I don't want to ruin anything for people trying to avoid news, but I'm reasonably certain that I know all the official pieces of news about the 50th and a fair few of the hints floating around from pictures of filming and the like. Yes I am excited, I'm going to bake dalek cakes for the occasion. I might even break from vegetarianism to indulge in some fish fingers and custard for the 23rd November.

I get what you mean about dirty playing (although my television was freaking out so I missed some of Holt's time in and didn't see him doing much), and I was really struck by how rude the Norwich players were to the ref after fouls were called. Snodgrass really went off after he clearly had a dirty tackle and there were a few other instances when the Norwich players seemed way more angry than warranted given that the reffing seemed pretty objective to me. 

I was disappointed that Michu didn't convert one of his numerous opportunities, and De Guzman seemed ready to hit it in a few times, but I think overall it was our defending that was shakier than our offense.

The episode had a very Classic Who feel to it. You're put into the middle of some alien world with it's own culture, politics and conflicts then you just have to figure things out from there. Not being entirely sure what's going on all the time I think helps put into the shoes of the companion better, as everything feels more alien and you can relate to their confusion to everything that's happening.

2) Donna: She had the universe revolve around her at the end of her 13 episodes because she became half doctor, hence the whole ""doctor Donna"" that was all over time and space. Same paradox, if he hadn't of taken her she would not of been special.
3) Amy: Same paradox again, the doctor became interested with her because of the crack in the wall, which was made by the pandorica exploding, which would not of happened if he had not of taken her.

You should have an existing A category provisional entitlement, it'll be listed on your paper counterpart with any other provisional entitlements. You just need the CBT to validate that entitlement.

Once you pass the module two test, you should get the same choice you'd have had after passing your car test: either surrender your licence then and there and receive an updated licence within a couple weeks, or send off for it yourself. I'd recommend the former as you get to keep the pass certificates.

And yes, it is possible to do an intensive course - contact your local motorcycle training schools for more info on their programs. You'll need to pass the theory test beforehand, but that's the only real restriction. The test centres do not rent bikes, motorcycle training schools do that. However, bear in mind that if you fail the module 1 test (for whatever reason), you will probably forfeit the module 2 test fee if done as an intensive course. This is because you won't have time to retake the module one before your mod2 test date - AFAIK there is a minimum 3 day period between taking module one and module two.

Public sector jobs *already* have a reputation for being cushy with great benefits, pension, holidays, and all that- yet we often see them going on strike against mild cuts to those benefits. This obviously rankles the workers who have to accept necessary cuts without such recourse. 

Union membership peaked at 80% at the start of Margaret Thatcher's tenure. There's a lot of debate over this period, ranging from the idea that she single-handedly saved the UK to the idea we should burn her at the stake as an obvious representative of some nether-daemon. What there isn't debate over is the excessive power unions had at the time. As an anecdotal example, my friend worked catering on the railways at the time and saw people work during the winter, declare themselves sick, and take a summer job bar tending in Spain whilst taking to pay-cheques. Any attempt to crackdown on that would be met with action from the Union and its legal team, disrupting services nationwide. The efficiency of industry was a joke when compared to other nations.

**Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?**  Eccleston (9) was my first.  I started watching last fall, beginning with the 2005 reboot.  

**Do you have a favourite Doctor?**  Eccleston.  Rumor has it you always love your first doctor the most, so maybe that's true for me.  I just feel like he was perfect in the role, and I wish he had been the Doctor for longer.

**Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?**  I'm not sure I can pick just one favorite, but I suppose I would say ""The Big Bang"" (Amy and Rory's wedding).  I just love that her memory brings the Doctor back.  No least favorite.

**Favourite companion?**  Rose, but Amy is a close 2nd.

**Favourite enemy?**  The Daleks.

**Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?**  Eccleston.  I hardly find anyone who really loves him.

**How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?**  I'm a fan, of course I want it to go on forever!

true,kabushman,null,null,"**Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?**
Technically, I saw an episode of Matt Smith's, and then decided to go back and start with Eccleston. So, I started watching my younger sister's (it pains me to say she found this masterpiece three years before me) new series DVDs August of 2012.

**Do you have a favourite Doctor?**
Tennant is by far my favorite. Granted, I haven't watched much of Classic Who. But, still.

**Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?**
This is hard. My favorite is probably ""Midnight"" just because it shows how powerful the human race is, which is something that the Doctor has always claimed. Except we actually REALLY see it happen against the one alien that protects them. Though the ""Silence in the Library""/""Forest of the Dead"" set is a close second.
My least favorite episode might be ""The Unicorn and the Wasp."" It was fun and cute, but just weird and out of place.

**Favourite companion?**
You would think Donna based on my favorite episodes, but actually Rose. But Donna is *really* close.

**Favourite enemy?**
I think the Daleks have an interesting aspect to them. I claim that yes, while they are obviously evil, they are also misunderstood. It is not inherently *their* fault for not having any other emotion than hate. But that's the psychology student in me. Other than them, the weeping angels because their way of killing someone is just terrifying. Also, the fact that they were completely new in the restart of the series but have already become a staple villain.

**Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?**
From the only one's I have seen, I'd have to say Eccleston's. I think he gets beat up on and forgotten at times, but I really liked him. I mean, he was incarnation that came immediately after the Time War, which makes it just amazing how he kept travelling, knowing he was the only one of his kind to be able to do so anymore.

**Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?**
I think it helped the series. If it had continued, I don't think it would have lasted this long. Yes, there were diehards then, but would they have continued watching it through all these years to get it to the point where it is today? Probably not.

**What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?**
I have not seen it, but I want to just so I can get the before and after picture of the Doctor.

**Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?**
From what I have read from various sources, it seems like the new series is pulling enough from the old one to keep the old series fans satisfied. As for 7b, Moffat is pulling a lot from 2nd Doctor, which seems to be pretty on the mark from what I've seen and read.

**How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?**
I think we've got a least three or four more seasons of it...though I would like it to last much longer than that.

**What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?**
I think Russel T. Davies' got the series to where it needed to be, which was an incredible task. But Steven Moffat is just taking it to another level. While Davies' definitely did this, Moffat has a knack for incorporating long, *long* story lines, which I absolutely love. That being said, I think Davies' will be the one who restarted what was already loved. Moffat is going to be the one who is always associated with the new series of *Doctor Who* just from the villains he has introduced, the multifaceted protagonists and the great plot lines. 

**What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?**
The 50th anniversary shows the perseverance of British television. If you have something great, it's going to be great years and years later (fifty to be exact). And I love the history of the show. It's fascinating, especially compared to the majority of garble coming out of American television.
 
**Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?**
I am excited about it, but still have some questions. I know about the confirmed actors (or so they say), though I'm not sure how it's going to work out. Also, I've heard it's supposed to be 3D, so I don't get how that's going to work on cable television, but I'll go with it for now. Besides that, I think it'll be a fantastic homage to the series as a whole and a must-see (clearly).

David tennent my boy

Something that we have seen in the NextGen Doctor Who is that he is always in his TARDIS when he regenerates, so these energies may be tied to his TARDIS and may be able to be recreated when the TARDIS is refueled.

The Master also received an extra set of regenerations for his services in the Time War, and while it is not mentioned, The Doctor may also have received an extra set of regenerations.

I've been to Oban, Skye, and Aberdeen in addition to Edinburgh. 

If you like nature and countryside, you will love Skye. Everyone who goes there ends up in Portree and/or Kyleakin so they're a little touristy but still very pretty island villages. Outside of the villages there are rolling hills, cliffs, coastlines, ""fairy"" pools, stone formations, and castles. Plus Talisker distillery. Try to climb the Quiraing - they filmed part of Highlander there and the view from the top is breathtaking. 

Oban was ok. I didn't find it as interesting as other places, but it's quite pretty around the bay. I think of it more as a resting place for people exploring the surrounding area. I might go to Mull instead. 

Personally, I like Aberdeen, but not a lot of people do. It's more of an industrial type of city than a cultural one like Edinburgh. It's right on the coast so you can walk down to the North Sea and walk along the beach and I think the University of Aberdeen campus is pretty. But if your city friends like a really bustling, cosmopolitan vibe, Aberdeen doesn't have that. 

Glasgow has really blossomed in the last decade or so. Do as much there as you can. I haven't been able to visit there yet, so I'm quite jealous. I've been hearing a lot of good things about the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. See something related to Charles Rennie Mackintosh - Glasgow School of Art, The Willow Tea Rooms, or House for an Art Lover. I've always wanted to see the Glasgow Necropolis, maybe a little morbid. Unless you're used to it, you may find the Glaswegian accent difficult. It tends to be very thick and fast with their own colloquialisms. Other places are much easier to follow but each area has its own slight twist.

true,Hesprit,pertwee,Pertwee,"**Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?** The end of the Patrick Troughtan era, 1973?  I was 6 or 7.

**Do you have a favourite Doctor?** Your first Doctor is always your favourite.  So Patrick is my favourite.  But I appreciate the strengths of all the Doctors, even going back to William Hartnell.  I think in many ways, Tom Baker was the strongest and is perhaps my favourite that I can give a fully thought out reason for.  He had the most time to grow into the roll, and was able to portray beautifully with inappropriate glee, with joyous anger and controlled abandon.  I think Matt Smith is doing some fine moments making me believe that such an old person is living in that young body.

**Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?**  Impossible to say.  The episode that has kept in my mind for years is Earthshock, when Adric dies.  It was such a shocking and sad moment.  On the other hand, Blink is an episode that we keep coming back to in discussions here, and is I think scarier than anything in classic Who.  Then again, the end of the Hand of Fear where we say farewell to Sarah Jane (we thought forever, but really only had to wait 25 years) was also tough on me and memorable (who chose that outfit?!) as Sarah Jane was around when I started realizing the difference guys and girls...although it was the introduction to Leela in the Face of Evil who truly carbonated my hormones.

**Favourite companion?**  Sarah Jane Smith, best female companion.  Jamie McCrimmon, best male companion.

**Favourite enemy?**  The Master.  Everything the Doctor is, the Master is as well, but polar twisted.  It has made for some fascinating stories, both classic and new Who.

**Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?** Paul McGann.  What a difficult position to be in.  One movie is all that most know him in, a movie that was americanizing the franchise for the money.  But he played the part with conviction.  I got the feeling that he truly respected the franchise and the character.  And the voice work he's done since is quite wonderful I think.

**Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?**  Oh God yes.  The stories were becoming a mess, and the continuity was becoming a burden rather than an enrichment.  And although it may get me crucified here, I'm hoping it doesn't drag for ten years of mostly mediocre stories before they pull it again.  

**What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?** I think it was a terrible idea beautifully executed.  Trying to get an American Network to buy the show and run it was ill conceived.  They could have done some horrible damage (doctor as part human...that's been ignored)...but luckily the ratings didn't pan out.  I think the main plot was okay and the sets inside the Tardis were beautiful.

**How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?**  I don't know if I can convey this.  It was a kick, nostalgia implies that you know how it turns out, this was nostalgia without knowing the ending, new nostalgia.  How cool is that?  It was exciting and, well, wonderful.

**Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?**  They did a great thing by killing off a lot of the burden of the continuity by having the unseen Last Great Time War.  It allowed them to start fresh and continue on with respect to the old who but keeping everything fresh and new.  It has been awesome.  Matt Smith with William Hartnell's library card was cool too.

**Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?** Not since an early 80's Doctor Who convention.  They all seemed tired and winced when I firmly shook their hands.

**How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?**  We are in year seven of a 12 year run I figure.  And I'm hoping they can keep the quality up for that long.  I'd love to see the BBC do some long term planning and saying that every ten years they are going to run the Doctor for a decade.  Ten years on, ten years off.  It would give them time to recreate the series again and again and again.

**What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?**  I think people who argue who is better are silly. Their Christmas Specials tend to define the differences: Davies tended towards huge stories with the entire world needing to be saved, then the entire universe, then the entire multiverse..um, where do we go from there?  What's bigger than that?  Moffat saves one old man and gives him a joyful last day with the woman he loves.  He saves a family, a flight crew and a forest.  He can't save an old man who grew up under the bad influence of evil snowflakes, but he does have the doctor save himself from maudlin introspection.

**What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?**  Can't answer this, Canajan eh?

**Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?**  No one knows about the episode except what theyve released.  I am excited.  I hope that it's worthy of the 50 years.  I suppose 11 doctors in one episode is too much to hope for...but wouldn't it have been cool?",0,1365307055,null,0,false,0,c9a1xk1,t3_1bt2br,t1_c9a1xk1,t3_1bt2br,null,1431646573,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

2.  It's hard to pick a favorite Doctor, they have all been so amazing and each has added their own unique addition to the development of the character.
3.  My favorite episode would have to be ""Vincent and the Doctor"", it always makes me feel happy and gives me a lot to think about.
4.  Favorite companion would have to be Wilf.  Good old Wilf.
5.  Favorite enemy would have to be the Dream Lord, because he is a personification of the part of the Doctor that he hates about himself, and in a way the audience is forced to hate the Doctor too.
6.  Definitely the Ninth Doctor, Eccleston did a fantastic job portraying a damaged Doctor and not enough people seem to give him a fair chance.
7.  The show was going in a direction that the fans weren't ready for, I can't say I agree or disagree with the decision but I can see why it wasn't as popular in the '80s.
8.  I would enjoy the movie more if they took things that happened and referenced them later in the show to confirm them (ie. the Doctor being half human).
9.  I hadn't heard of the show at that point.
10.  Yes, I have always liked the continuity between the Old and New Who.
11.  Sadly, no.
12.  I would like for the show to run for at least 10 more years as there is so much that the show could cover before it ends, but that depends on how invested the writers are in the show as time goes on.
13.  I liked Davies' style better, I liked the season long arcs and having old characters come back.
14.  It's a huge deal, 50 years is a long time for there to be such a devoted fanbase and the show has had such a huge affect on British culture.

true,Asatora,null,null,"What if... Clara is a manifestation BY the TARDIS to help him overcome the guilt he has for the loss of his companions (the Ponds being the breaking point)? Hear me out. The TARDIS understands that the Doctor needs a companion and it knows he is guilt ridden and can't 'regenerate' out of it. To deal with the guilt, it creates Clara. Her 'memories' are that of Roses (who becomes part of the TARDIS to save him) and hence the time overlap and that of other companions. Every time 'Clara' dies, the TARDIS learns how to make her exponentially better.  
First episode with her: she helps him escape the Daleks, what else in the world could reprogram them but the TARDIS? (computer skills learned from third episode)
Second episode: Clara learns 'nanny' skills (used in third episode) and her psychic connection to the family mourning her death creates salt water rain. (saving the Doctor again)
Third episode: She is of great interest to the intelligence and they want to trap her (could you imagine what could be accomplished if they trapped the TARDIS?) but she needs to learn computer skills, so the TARDIS enters the internet and absorbs that knowledge.
Fourth Episode: the ring was the memory of her mother, he said it that all the people (seven planets, not him) wanted her to have it back. It took the emotion of seven plants worth of people to buy back the ring (the ring is her mom, her mom is the TARDIS), no wonder the leaf worked when his memory didn't. If the planet absorbed the TARDIS knowledge, it would definitely be full.

There's no end to the small details I could write but those are the rough ideas. The point of the TARDIS doing this is for him to grow, to learn to accept help and to learn how to love himself. Why wouldn't the TARDIS create a companion he doesn't have to worry about dying?

Alan Hansen pretty much summed it up in his biography, 'A Matter of Opinion': 

* *""Every player concentrated on giving the sort of passes that a team-mate wanted to receive, rather than the ones he wanted to play; and every player repeatedly made good runs off the ball to give the man in possession plenty of options.""*


Rodgers employs possession based football as his underlying philosophy. The idea is to control possession until a good opening is present. This might involve many short passes: Barcelona's employs shorts passes at lot, thus Tiki-Taka. Patience is a key here.

       Officially, my first doctor was Nine. Iwatched Ten off and on, but I didn't start watching religiously until the Eleventh Doctor came into play.
2. Do you have a favourite Doctor?
        I'm torn between the Tenth and Eleventh. If I were forced to pick one, it would probably be the Eleventh.
3. Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?
        Blink. The fact that DW can just ride paradoxes and create such an amazing episode without even featuring any of the main characters is just brilliant.
4. Favourite companion?
        Rory, in the later episodes. Amy turned into kind of a needy b***h at that point and he really got some room to shine.
5. Favourite enemy?
        I liked the 2010 Christmas Special, A Christmas Carol, where there was no clear enemy except time itself, forcing the separation of Kazran and Abigail.
6. Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?
        I've never seen any Classic Who. Therefore, I cannot comment on this.
7. What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?
        Never seen it.
8. How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?
        I had never heard of it back then, but it sounded pretty frickin' cool.
9. Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?
       No, but one of my goals for the next couple of years is to get myself to Comic Con and meet some of these people that I idolize.
10. How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?
       As long as the writers keep coming up with good ideas and I don't die from suspense a la Moffat, I would love for it to air indefinitely.
11. What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?
       I think Moffat deals with darker issues and more arching storylines, as opposed to Davies' one lighthearted story a week (not to say that they didn't mix at all), but I have no real preference between the two. 
12. Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?
       I am pretty excited about it (definitely not as much as others, see r/doctorwho), but excited nonetheless. I don't know much, just that David Tennant, Billie Piper, and some classic villain I've never heard of will be in it. (Tennant and Smith in the same episode? W00t!)

Before I do this, obviously these are my opinions.  Mostly, this is here to point out that the two parters are a mixed bag, as well.

 * The first two parter of the revived Who was freaking terrible (Farting Aliens of London).    
 * The 2nd two parter with 9 was really good (""are you my mommy?"").    
 * The 9th Doctor send-off was good-but-not-great.  Jack was the stand-out star of it, IMO.    
 * The Rose/10 two parter (cybermen, alternate reality, Mickey is an underground hero) is ... ok.    
 * The Satan Pit one is... I mean, I don't remember it being bad, and it was epic in scope, but it honestly was slightly forgettable.    
 * Army of Ghosts/ Doomsday - good.  Bye bye to Rose, and that was done well.    
 * Daleks in Manhattan / Evolution of the Daleks (the Martha/10 two parter) is atrociously terribad. 
 * Family of Blood was pretty good.  Liked it.
 * Utopia / Sound of the Drums / Last of the Timelords was a masterpiece (pun intended).
 * Sontaran / Poison Sky was ok at best.    
 * The Stolen Earth / Journey's End was also great.  Poor Donna.
 * Time of the Angels / Flesh and Stone ruined the weeping angles.  Once you see them move, it's ... not scary anymore.  Less is more, people.
 * The Pandorica - it was good, the acting was great, the idea was good, but - I'm still upset that it seems like Moffat has trouble wrapping up an epic story arc.  Why did the universe explode?  Crack in the wall?  What actually happened?  What?  Who?  Explain, please.
 * The Rebel Flesh / The Almost People - Again, good, but not great.  Kind of gimmicky.  ""Let's have two Matt Smiths!"".  Not bad, but not great.

So, anyway, it's a mixed bag.  Largely representative of post-revival Who, if you ask me.  Most are OK, some are absolute crap (but fewer than the good ones), and every once in a while, one is amazing.

It was also theorized that the doctor was another time lord that new susan threw himself into the loom* came out of the loom and some how they emotionally new each other even though the Doctor had no memories so they started traveling together.

*It was possible that the doctor was the unspoken of third timelord that gave them their timetravel abilities along with rassilon and omega. The last season before it was canceled was leading up to that idea with ace asking if the doctor was one of the three and him not answering. It is also possible that as time goes on he remembers more and more of what happened before he reloomed himself even though he shouldn't have any memories (he being more powerful some how kept them). The reason he ran from Gallifrey at the young age of ~200 when he remembered who he was and why he reloomed himself. It is also a lot of the reason he was so upset about what happened to Gallifrey since he wasn't just responsible for their destruction he also gave them the powers they were abusing for all sorts of stuff. While they were still alive he didn't like them more because his children were screwing up instead of just people being stupid.    
This was almost all done before the cancellation of doctor who so we have no idea if the ideas would have been used or became cannon. Alot of them are large ideas for a tv show aimed at kids. But i am willing to bet some one like moffat has read the books and the unfinished scrips and idea books left when the show was cancled and might come back to one of these ideas.

I honestly hated most of the first half of Season 7 because, aside from Asylum of the Daleks, they were very throwaway episodes and didn't use Amy and Rory in a proper way. Don't get me started on Angels in Manhatten because the way Amy and Rory were sent off is just bullshit.

More than that, if we look at the first half of the season we have: Dinosaurs on Spaceships which basically just plays with big ticket hype magnet tropes. A Town Called Mercy, which is the same except with Cowboys and Aliens. The Power of Three had so much potential, but it was shafted with a giant Deus Ex Machina and really should have been a dramatic 2 parter. 

That said, it's not more American, rather, it's more Hollywood.

The Snowmen was fun I thought, and was a hell of a lot more like the Christmas Specials I loved than The Doctor, THe Widow and the Wardrobe (which was horribly boring)

The Bells of St.John I loved because it felt important and less Deus-Ex-Machina-y. But the recent episode is basically Hollywood's emotional porn channel all over again.

Artisan Roast (on Broughton Street and in Bruntsfield) and Brewlab (Near Chambers Street in Old Town) - These are coffee bars run by hipsters who take their coffee very seriously and it is delicious

Patisserie Madeline - In Stockbridge - has delightful desserts

Sprio - St Stephen Street - An authentic italian cafe. I recommend the paninis

Lovecrumbs - On Bread Street - Also run by hipsters who take their cake very seriously (also has excellent tea)

Peters Yard (in the Quartermile and in Stockbridge) - Excellent Scandinavian cafe

* Salt, pepper, vinegar, ketchup etc.,
* All fruit, vegetables, nuts etc.  You should generally buy them loose but often the value bags are actually cheaper,

* Tinned fish, these are normally exactly the same as the brand labelled ones.  Tuna is expensive, has a high mercury content and isn't particularly tasty.  Frugal people prefer sardines, pilchards and mackerel which you can get in sauces for easy preparation.

Avoid:

* ""bread"".  Treat yourself to a nice roll or something once a week instead of buying this awful foam stuff.  Or look into making your own bread which can be better than even the fresh stuff from a supermarket,
* Processed meat products. High rusk/fat content in these. If you can't afford good stuff then avoid. Vegetables are cheaper than meat,
* Jars of sauce etc. Frugal people make their own sauces,
* Bog roll.  This just doesn't work out much cheaper.  The Tesco ones at least actually do have bigger tubes and the paper is far less wide causing you to use more squares.  Just get the ""normal"" supermarket own brand stuff and use less of it,
* Kitchen paper.  The value ones are almost completely useless so you might as well avoid buying it completely.

And even then, it has to be shown that interference with that would be disproportionate to the 'legitimate aim of maintaining immigration control'. 

So for example, you're an Afghan, and you're initially granted limited leave to remain for five years on the basis of a real risk of harm at the hands of the Taliban. In that period in the UK you make no substantial friendships, no community ties (like to churches, social clubs, etc), aren't involved in education, are unemployed for all that time, have no long-term partner, no children etc. Then your five years are up, during which time circumstances in Afghanistan have changed such that it can be shown you would be safe to return. In these circumstances you would have an *exceptionally* difficult time arguing Article 8. If you have serious medical problems you believe would be untreatable in Afghanistan, you could also appeal under Article 2 right to life. But otherwise, if the position in your country is safe for you to return, removals directions will be made against you and your appeals will in all likelihood be dismissed.

In contrast, the Bolivian man with the cat showed that he had a lasting relationship with his partner that it would have been disproportionate to have interfered with by returning him and splitting them apart. The cat was just the icing.

People wail about people getting 'free money', but this is where we could invest in getting people back to work, and paying back into the system.  

I go to a local 'job club', and too often, people are having to reject jobs because they're too far away, and they can't afford to get there for a month.

Also, in this time of huge unemployment, why am I expected to look for work within 90 minutes travel? Surely there's going to be hundreds of people far nearer, and again, I flatly can't afford to get there.

Perhaps even just a loan like student loans, where you repay it at a fair rate, once you've been employed for six months, and you're earning over a certain amount.

However, with the trend towards part time work and minimum wage work, they might never repay it.

Nonsense.

Yes, it is good that UK firms are able to compete on an equal footing with US firms when bidding for contracts in the USA - and the other way around.

Right now there are US laws that either outright ban UK firms from bidding for US contracts or restrict the percentage of a contract they are allowed to deliver from UK based factories/etc.

A foreign company needs special permission to invest in a telephone network, cannot own a majority of a TV channel etc. A US firm investing overseas will pay double-taxation in the invested country and the USA.

...so the principle of equal and fair competition is a damn good one.

However, the scaremongering bullshit that this gives companies super-powers to overturn a sovereign government is laughable.

The UK/USA/whoever is always sovereign. It alone passes laws to permit equality of trade, and it alone can also rescind those laws.

If the UK wants to be protectionist, it can be. Just as the USA can be. Most economists and historians will tell you that is a bad idea - but it is impossible for a government of today to in any way cede power to another body in a manner that would bind any future government from simply reversing the change.

Not that extreme.

If the temperatures rise to the 4-6% some are projecting, the die off will be all the more severe, and if we continue to prevaricate or do like the Americans and Chinese are and put our collective heads in the sand, the feedback effects may kick in and the rise may become irreversible, in decades rather than centuries, on any timescale or to any degree which can save us.

 A planet-alien that eats memories is not too terrible. The part that annoyed me was that it somehow got overfed by a leaf which represents memories that didn't exist is what annoyed me. I mean, really, what the fuck? I could pick up a pen and say this represented all the times my fairy-god-parent hasn't existed and would that kill it? 

AND THEN there is that the Doctor could perform some sort of magic with his sonic screwdriver, which involved serious physical workout. I can accept it being a unlockdoor-hackanything-interactwithcomputer stick, but when it interacts with thing like this I just can't enjoy it.

true,cleanyoungbob,null,null,"&gt; Realistically, anyone can start attending church, volunteering at the local dog's home and establish a regular once-a-week drinking buddy (or membership of the knitting or reading circle).

If you can't speak English, how are you supposed to attend a reading circle? Or get a volunteer job? And regardless, none of those things of themselves will allow you to stay - you could doggedly attend church for five years, but if in that time you haven't developed any durable relationships that couldn't be replicated in your country of origin it will be considered of very limited weight in the Article 8 balancing exercise. 

The point is about *proportionality* - you can easily show you have a private life, but what you have to show is that it would be *disproportionate to interfere with it*. Having a friend you see once a week establishes some sort of private life, but a decision maker will just say ""You can easily re-establish yourself in Afghanistan and find new friends there. It would therefore not be disproportionate to remove you"". And without more that would be a legally sound decision.

And as for 'have a kid', even that is not enough of itself, and plenty of people still fail in their Article 8 claims when they have children.  Unless you can show that you have a relationship that is of particular value to the child, that the rights of the child themselves would be violated by your removal, and that the child couldn't accompany you back to Afghanistan (for example, if the mother is a British citizen, which would be very unlikely if you were the above non-English speaking Afghan refugee), then simply having a child won't do you any good at all.

Abstract
We study the impact of a minimum wage in a segmented labor market in which workers are at different stages of their careers. At the end of a learning-by-doing period, workers paid the minimum wage quit “bad jobs” for better-paying “good jobs”, following an on-the-job search process with endogenous search intensity. A rise in the minimum wage reduces “bad jobs” creation and prompts workers to keep their “bad jobs” by reducing on-the-job search intensity. The ambiguous impact on unqualified employment replicates and explains the findings of several empirical studies. However, a minimum wage rise reduces overall employment and output.

Abstract
This paper provides a theoretical analysis of optimal minimum wage policy in a perfectly competitive labor market and obtains two key results. First, we show that a binding minimum wage – while leading to unemployment – is nevertheless desirable if the government values redistribution toward low wage workers and if unemployment induced by the minimum wage hits the lowest surplus workers first. Importantly, this result remains true in the presence of optimal nonlinear taxes and transfers. In that context, a binding minimum wage enhances the effectiveness of transfers to low-skilled workers as it prevents low-skilled wages from falling through incidence effects. Second, when labor supply responses are along the extensive margin only, which is the empirically relevant case, the co-existence of a minimum wage with a positive tax rate on low-skilled work is always (second-best) Pareto inefficient. A Pareto improving policy consists of reducing the pre-tax minimum wage while keeping constant the post-tax minimum wage by increasing transfers to low-skilled workers, and financing this reform by increasing taxes on higher paid workers. Those results imply that the minimum wage and subsidies for low-skilled workers are complementary policies.

But personally I think a player's wage should ideally reflect their value/ability/place in the hierarchy at that club. That's why whenever they've tried to correlate spending with league position, the amount spend in transfers doesn't correlate, but the wage bill tends to be a better indicator of league finish.

A major issue we have in society now is families having multiple children without the means to support them.  This is a cultural shift from 50 years ago where families knew that if they had children they would have to fully support them themselves - which means less money per person in the family. 

Now families know that for every child they will receive benefit from the government.  Low income families have vast numbers of children all requiring benefit, often very unfortunately in deprived areas where the cycle will perpetuate itself.

It is a problem that can't really be fixed, the government (any party) _has_ to provide benefits to these families out of human need.

Anyway, I do not have a problem with people working to support themselves if they are able to do so. What I do have a problem with is paying job seekers £50/£70 for a full weeks work, especially if we're subsidising private industry at the expense of paid employment. 

&gt;In an ideal world yes. Unfortunately the UK has a benefits system and its distorted the job market in the first place. The ideal way of dealing with this is workfare and the government has three choices; provide labour in competition to private enterprise, provide labour in areas where there is no private industry or provide labour for private industry.

literature. Moreover, their analysis covers a longer time interval and 
deploys time-varying policy and institutional regressors. They report 
average effects consistent with minimum wages causing material employment losses among the target group and, less conclusively, elevated joblessness as well. Their cross-country findings agree with 
Neumark and Wascher on the role of some individual labor market 
institutions and policies, but the authors do not observe the same 
patterns in the institutional data: specifically, prime-age females do 
not exhibit stronger employment losses in countries with the least 
regulated markets.

THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SECURITi^ TAXES
AND MINIMUM WAGES ON EMPLOYMENT:
EVIDENCE FROM TURKEY
KERRY L. PAPPS*
Using worker-level panel data for the period from 2002 to 2005, the
author analyzes the separate employment effects of increases in the
social security taxes paid by employers and increases in the minimum wage in Turkey. Variation over time among low-wage workers
in the ratio of total labor costs to the gross wage gives rise to a natural experiment. The author's regression estimates indicate that a
given increase in social security taxes has a larger negative effect on
the probability of a worker remaining employed in the next quarter
than an equal size increase in the minimum wage. This result is incompatible with the textbook model of labor supply and demand,
and it suggests that workers may increase effort in response to an
increase in wages. The author's comparison of the employment responses of workers in different demographic groups provides some
indirect evidence that the central finding is consistent with this
explanation.

I also said that I wouldn't pay over the top wages, I think there should be a 140 K wage cap, but top players will demand a lot of money.

However, the security and peace of mind that comes with being in a union with legal representation an indemnity insurance is absolutely vital. Any health care worker these days is extremely vulnerable to accusations of abuse, (and rightly so, abuse disclosures should *always* be taken seriously) and having someone to back you and advise you in the event of a false allegation is incredibly important.

Also having a professional service to contact and to whistleblow through is vital (particularly in the light of several major scandals that have hit the media in recent years, all of which had people desperately trying to whistleblow, and not being listened to.) So having an independent professional body that you can contact and have a conversation about something that is concerning you at work, and whether it is something that you need to report or to take to the police and so forth is important to protect not just yourself from being caught up in some terrible situation not of your making, but also to protect *everyone*, patients families and staff. It also saves the taxpayer money in the long run as it prevents costly investigation and compensation and all that jazz by preventing the situation arising in the first place, or by nipping it in the bud, so even the bean counters are happy!

I personally feel that HCA's, auxiliaries, support workers and other non-nursing healthcare staff are far more vulnerable than a nurse, and my absolute advice to anyone in a healthcare role is to union up.

Not all care companies are loving and caring, and some will not hesitate to deposit you in the shit from a great height if it saves them from some kind of scandal. In my experience just telling people you are in a union can stop unwarranted disciplinary procedures from even starting, or can make sure that if you do end up with some kind of accusation or complaint made about you that at the very least all proper procedures to protect both you and the person who has put in the complaint will be followed.

Another important thing is that most unions will offer counselling or other emotional support alongside legal and professional advice. This can be invaluable to someone who is feeling burnt out, is struggling, or is undergoing an investigation. Having access to someone to support you means you can support your patients better, which is after all the most important thing. 

So to sum up, get in a union. It's not dear, and it protects you, it protects your patients and it provides a framework in which positive changes can be made and, negative issues can be identified and hopefully sorted out. It means that your employer has to follow the rules, and provides you with the support that you need to do the same, and to provide better care for your patients without burning out or sacrificing your all to the job. 

**TL:DR:**  Get your healthcaring arse in a union, right now. It's not just about striking, it's about protecting yourself, protecting your patients and making sure that you can be the best nurse you can be, safely and supported. You can't do it alone.

Tuition fees are what, 9k a year now. So on a 4 year degree, people are gonna come out with 36k in debt, at ~ 7% - so yearly interest of roughly 2.5k. 


Lets assume a graduate gets a 30k job - and they have to repay 9% of everything over 21k earned - thats £810 a year. Now the interest rate scales so lets assume its actually ~ 5% for this loan.  That gives interest of £1800 a year vs payments of 810. so their loan **grows** by £1k a year. They'll never pay it off. 


on a 41k job (the max interest rate) - you'd still only pay off £1800 a year vs £2500 in interest.


Loans are still cancelled after 30 years - but it means you've got 30 years of having that money taken out of your wages

People are fallible, and make mistakes. The point of a union is to support each other and to try to ensure that if mistakes are made then they can be fixed and addressed.

This is good news for the lenders though, for several other reasons.  It gives the lender priority over other unsecured debts, and any subsequent mortgages you take out (see mejogid's comment).  It gives the lender better security and may allow them to treat the debt differently in their accounts.  Finally, and very importantly, it allows the lender to send scary letters that say ""you may lose your home"" in block capitals.

Its the threat of repossession that is useful to lenders, even if repossession is unlikely to happen in practice.  As the reaction on this thread shows, people take these kinds of legal threat seriously and will probably make greater efforts to repay the debt as a result.

true,fragglet,null,null,"The majority of people in the UK are not part of a union, especially people in the middle class. In the '80s there was a ""battle"" fought between the trade unions and the conservative government, which the government is widely acknowledged to have ""won"". The trade unions in the '80s often had communist political associations, and there's still that lingering association, so it's easy for people to brand them as ""extremists"" in some way or other. The narrative (and I'm not saying it's the truth) is something like: the unions held the country hostage, but Thatcher ""broke"" them and fixed the economy.

Because most people are not members of unions today, most people only experience them second-hand, when they're on the receiving end of strike action. Big examples are strikes by train staff, teachers and airplane flight attendants (BA). Often these are targeted by unions to cause most disruption (like BA staff striking at Christmas) which probably doesn't do them a lot of favours with the public. Often the people going on strike are perceived as greedy for doing so.

If this society really was full of benefit scroungers I'm pretty sure you'd see dozens of these families outside the scope of the media. But do you?

It's basically an unsavoury set of welfare reforms that are being forced through under the guise of fixing a problem that is claimed to be widespread, but isn't.

I don't have any statistics but I have experienced the situation both first and second hand. I am a product of a welfare state supported childhood and the taxes I pay as an adult are contributing back to the system, and I hope they will continue to do so throughout the rest of my working life.

The problem is that the welfare bill cannot be paid through HMRC's tax income because the economic downturn has meant that there is less money moving; this is being passed off as ""out of control"" by the government. I don't agree that the welfare system should be gutted to try and find savings, because by cutting it you're making it harder to survive and find a job by reducing the amount of money a person can claim.

A travelcard for suburban London costs at least £30 a week alone, on top of rent that can cost upwards of £150 a week even in shared accommodation. People need to buy formal interview clothes and keep them clean, they need to eat so they have enough energy to keep searching for jobs.

Because it's so hard to find a job it's likely they'll keep looking for a few months, with absolutely sod all money left over to go and actually live, instead of exist.

Why should people who genuinely want to get out there suffer:
(a) because of a very small minority who abuse the system that's reported on by the media?
(b) because of a financial and economic problem they didn't cause?

I don't know why, but if a politician writes a pitchfork-grabbing article about these people with the intentions of evoking jealousy and hatred you can bet that the electorate will be too darn angry to fight it.",0,1365340290,null,0,false,0,c9a7d7q,t3_1budlg,t1_c9a7d7q,t1_c9a64ga,null,1431644012,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I sought to prove of disprove nothing. Please look into the burden of proof.

""(a) because of a very small minority who abuse the system that's reported on by the media? ""

You need to provide statistical evidence supporting this assertion. You can honestly make qualitative statements all day long, as I could, but unless you're actually going to bring out some real numbers you can effectively be ignored. 

""because of a financial and economic problem they didn't cause?""

I don't understand this point. Of course I understand the words you use and the sentence structure etc. But it just doesn't make sense. If there is money in the pot to help people then by all means help people. If there is no money in the pot then stop helping people. Why are people entitled to state funds regardless of if there are funds? Who caused what is meaningless. But then again saying they didn't cause the downturn is suggesting that someone else did cause the downturn... which is interesting.

Now as to your other point;

""find savings, because by cutting it you're making it harder to survive and find a job by reducing the amount of money a person can claim.""

According to your world view. According to other peoples world view a massive welfare state makes it harder to find a job in the first place.

""A travelcard for suburban London costs at least £30 a week alone, on top of rent that can cost upwards of £150 a week even in shared accommodation. People need to buy formal interview clothes and keep them clean, they need to eat so they have enough energy to keep searching for jobs.""

And most people do this without relying on the state to support them. It seems like you live in this magical land where no one can survive unless the state helps them. In fact I would say you live in an ideological world that the welfare state has created. You seem to think state support is there to help people do everything rather than as a last resort to help the destitute.",0,1365340757,null,0,1365341299,0,c9a7fwj,t3_1budlg,t1_c9a7fwj,t1_c9a7d7q,null,1431643976,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

When Clara came back with the child in the Akhaten episode, the TARDIS didn't open up, though they clearly left the door open, and she commented that she didn't think the TARDIS liked her - telling and foreshadowing I think. Though it was also telling that he didn't giver Clara a key - think about that and all the other companions.

Also, when he rode the motocycle out during the spoonheads, I was like 'um, won't people just wander into the box to at least see how he did that trick - which was out of character for the Doctor in my thoughts, using the TARDIS to gain money of all things. Odd

Anyway, after watching both season episodes back to back yesterday, I was getting angry at how often the door was left flapping open, but every time it was closed again when they got back to it.

  Girls started knitting Tom Baker scarves in my middle school.
  You have to remember, at that time, there were twelve channels if you had cable, and I was lucky.  CNN, some other TBS channels, and all of them ran re-runs of old shows like Gunsmoke, and Hawaii Five-O, and the like.   
  If you watch an episode of 'Family Guy' you'll see all the references to all the shows that were old and syndicated that I saw too.
  
  Anyway, the Doctor was so different from the basic fare on American cable, it hit a lot of us between the eyes.  We'd see it's on with a Saturday Pledge Drive, and pop in the EP VHS casette on the VCR and roll.

This isn't about protecting jobs, this is about supporting Bob Crow's agenda.

Likewise at the other end of the scale, the unions have far too much influence over the Labour party. This intertwining of the two has led to deep politicisation of both some unions and the party itself, and damages it's ability to present a coherent but practical opposition to the Tories.

Humans are resourceful. We all know it's possible to survive on next-to-nothing. But what people miss, _especially_ the students who lived off shit noodles whilst they were studying, is the abject misery of that experience being the whole of one's life. The further you are from the experience of being poor the less likely you are to understand it. It's not as simple as just managing a budget and expectations. Wearing a pair of shoes until they fall apart, not being able to put the heating on, running out of electricity on your key meter because you wanted enough water to have a shower, and being constantly bombarded with images of consumer goods you will _never be able to afford_ every time you go to the shops or switch on the telly, having to put up with living in a shit area with no jobs on a crappy estate filled with criminals because that's the only place the council had room to put you. The experience of being poor is a daily grind that's soul-destroying. 

I've been there, done all that. I was lucky enough to get out of it. Not everyone is so lucky. Many of the people on this site are ignorant of the reality of that existence and so we get those little shopping price lists and bickering about flatscreens in every thread. But then others are downright callous about it.

true,willmorgan,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; I sought to prove of disprove nothing. Please look into the burden of proof.

Correct. You obviously sought to make a smarmy comment on the internet.

&gt; You need to provide statistical evidence supporting this assertion. You can honestly make qualitative statements all day long, as I could, but unless you're actually going to bring out some real numbers you can effectively be ignored.

Where does one start his search? It's a very subjective label to coin on somebody, a ""scrounger"". Perhaps you could help me define it so I can go and search a report or two?

&gt; If there is money in the pot to help people then by all means help people. If there is no money in the pot then stop helping people.

It seems that money takes precedence over ethics and kindness for you. Not so much for me, or many other people who are down-voting you. It also seems quite short sighted.. you say ""help"", but what is the aim of welfare? I would say the aim of welfare is to lend a hand to a person in need, so they can help themselves or their children emerge out of need and back in to being an independent person.

&gt; saying they didn't cause the downturn is suggesting that someone else did cause the downturn... which is interesting.

The global financial system isn't a natural phenomenon, it's man made. Of course at some point somebody caused it, I believe these lot are in part responsible through making some stupid decisions: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22056275

&gt; According to your world view. According to other peoples world view a massive welfare state makes it harder to find a job in the first place.

Without a welfare system, what to you propose the people who have literally nobody else to lend a helping hand would do?

&gt; And most people do this without relying on the state to support them. It seems like you live in this magical land where no one can survive unless the state helps them. In fact I would say you live in an ideological world that the welfare state has created. You seem to think state support is there to help people do everything rather than as a last resort to help the destitute.

Uh, no. For one I don't receive any benefits, secondly while my girlfriend was unemployed for over 6 months, we still didn't receive any benefits (whilst on a reasonably low salary with the high costs associated with London). But luckily the sector in which I work doesn't have an unemployment problem and I had savings that I could burn through while she found another job. Without those savings however, those 6 months could have ended in a different way altogether.

In a way I do live in a magical land. I live in a country where the living standard is generally very good and where if you lose your job, you've got an allowance to help fund your next job search. Certainly, after paying all my taxes over the last few years that's the least I could expect back. What's more, if I have a health problem, every other taxpayer in the country chips in with me to treat my condition.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am afraid that we won't be able to qualify for the Champions League this time around, but that's okay. At the start of the season, I was very content with us finishing just outside the CHL spots.

We need to reflect properly upon our squad and manager. For much of the team, it's still their first season at Spurs.
Lloris, Vertonghen, Dembele, Sigurdsson, Dempsey were all brougth in in the summer, Holtby even later. The manager is new and it's Caulkers first full season with the squad. 

We've lost huge profiles from last season due to transfers, and long time injuries have hit BAE, Parker, Sandro, Kaboul. The timing of Sandros and Parkers injuries luckily fell so that we had one of them fit at any given time, but Kaboul isn't back yet. BAE hasn't found form after coming back. 

Defoe and Ade have alternated between being injured and out of form. We had a brief spell were Defoe scored enough goals to justify his lack of participation, but other than that, we've had to rely on our midfielders to create scoring chances and to finish them. 

I think the two biggest mistakes AVB has made this season was 

1. Loaning out Rose, which I can justify by saying it was quite hard to predict our LB worries
2. Loaning out Townsend, after it was hopelessly clear that we would need him quite a lot during the end of the season.

I'm hoping that this game is a indication that Ade is picking up some form, and if we close out the season well, we can be very proud of our season.

If we can get results against Chelsea and City, we could probably even get in the CHL anyways. 

I'm cautiously optimistic about the end of the season, though I try to keep realistic. But the true promise of this team lies with how we'll be able to perform over the next few seasons. We've got so much talent in the squad, we just need to add the last bit of sharpness in attack and we'll be a great team.

Because there are an infinite number of memories that could have potentially been had Clara's mother not passed away at an early age, it made it much more powerful than the memories provided by the Doctor.

As far as the songs go, the age of the singer didn't matter.  The only reason they had a child singing was because the last singer had passed away; Mary would have continued singing into her old age as well.  They purpose of the songs was to relay the history of their culture, not the history of the individual person.  That's why Mary had to know everything that had ever happened with her people.  The songs were simply a method of delivering all those years of memories to the parasite.

There are some interesting edge cases that might fall ill of the term ""scrounger"", like:

1. A well-off family that claimed child tax credit even though they didn't really need it.

2. A chronically depressed person claiming incapacity benefit because they don't have the mental resilience to work.

3. A family with both parents working who do unskilled work while juggling with parenting their child/ren because they can't afford childcare costs, and their benefits exceed their income.

Where do you really draw the line? Even so, benefit fraud accounted for £900 million in 2008/09 but spending on welfare as a whole (social protection) was £190 billion in 2009/10. These were both consecutive years in which Labour was in power, so I think it's fairly safe to assume there wasn't much of a change. As a proportion of total expenditure that's minuscule. Of course we should always strive for 0 fraud, but that pretty much proves the original statement from /u/Gosuben anyway:

&gt; Which is why I'm glad that there aren't enough of them for me to even give a shit. In virtually no way do they do any significant damage to my pocket. Collectively, all the scroungers in the UK probably cost me less money per year than I cost myself by losing a pound coin or two down the back of my car seat (the maths and stats agree with me here!)

We are sitting in /r/doctorwho where The Doctor is a point of fascination: a character encompassing the human spirit of adventure, travel, spontaneity, abandonment, curiosity, and much more.  The show, in part, is a celebration of this drive.   We celebrate these ideals and applaud the show's ability to capture those native traits we all share [to some degree].

This is a bit long-winded but I cannot help but point out the irony.  We celebrate a Doctor who always questions the status quo yet down-vote a simple question.   This is just funny almost but there is likely a simple explanation as to why you are shot down:

* Lack of effort before your question (Google it first, a simple search of *PSA stands for* would have quickly answered your question.

* Your spelling which suggests immaturity which many Redditors instinctively try to escape.  (This may not be accurate but perception is reality.)

What is ironic is that you are down-voted to the degree you are, a single down-vote would obviously have sufficed.

---  

All of what I have said leads to an unfortunate realization the Internet has come to today: **information noise**.  The whole point of Reddit or any feed-oriented site is to provide a filter and a manner in which to drown out the unimportant or poor quality content.  Objective journalism seeks to conquer this in publication; however, here on a place like Reddit, the users are the editors.

""The Internet"", or ""world wide web"" if we were in the 90's, is a funny thing.  Humanity is facing an upset, a sudden change.  A century ago, I may be having a conversation (such as this) at a tavern I rode to on a horse.  Instead I type this from a cellphone (with a physical keyboard).  You aren't supposed to be amazed by my saying this an I am reiterating what we both know well beyond the scope of this comment.  However my point is the Internet's submitted to consumed ratio is radically new.  Traditional cable television networks struggle with this today, that fabled upload speed is costly on existing infrastructure.  A newspaper on a stand does not have a comment section but rather a few editorials.

Just like this comment, the Internet is full of noise.  Reddit is a remarkable natural reaction to a side-effect.  A simple vote among the masses serves as an aggregate to form that ""ideal editor"".  When someone sees your comment, they may instinctively down-vote it not because it is really terrible in itself, but because it is something that adds noise: an easily searched idea.

---

The Doctor is that perfect escape and experience, part of why I believe we like him.  To be able to relive moments (rewind time), his ability to notice just the right details, and to understand the scope of it all ... well it leaves us in awe.  In Episode 2 of Season 1 *The End of the World*, The Doctor remarks on how insignificant a single person's actions are towards the inevitable course [of the sun and time].  But at the same time, this does not make any single person less important.  

The Doctor is nothing without his companions and what makes him remarkable is compassion for the individual, understanding of the big picture, and the intolerance of bad behavior.  But what is The Doctor to many [in the show]?  Just enough.  For example, he does not provide a scientific background to the operation of a sonic screwdriver but at one point simply states it performs his thoughts.  Does he warn people the TARDIS is bigger on the inside?  No, that is something that is easily realized.  Numerous examples seem to all point to the same idea of The Doctor being that perfect informational filter / editor.

--- 

I am almost done here at the toilet so my comment must conclude (~10 minutes!).  My point is your comment is great because your curious but noise, a waste.  Imagine having a TARDIS and a month.  Where would you go?  Your comment would be like traveling forward a week.

*Since this comment is really fucking long, I must say my intention is not to be an asshole and much of this should be considered an ""introspective narration"".  You know your comment was mundane and that only took a sentence or two to explain from me or anyone.  I do not pretend to have a ""realization of the big picture"" or some ""profound wisdom"" different from you, but rather saw this comment as a reflection of both why Reddit exists and the qualities of Doctor Who we adore (while taking a shit).  Hope the rest of your weekend is excellent and just remember to Google it next time...* `:)`

I'm registered disabled with a form of muscular dystrophy and worked up until 3 and a half years ago until I became unable to.  Sometimes I think the difficulty and pain that I would endure through working would be less hassle in the long run than having to live with social stigmata and justify my right to benefits to Atos and the like.

Most of my ""luxury"" items were bought when I sold my house when I moved north.  Most of my kids clothes are either tesco or Primark. Most of my clothes are either years old or have been given to me second hand from my cousin.  The same with my Mrs, we always go without in favour of the kids. Thankfully we don't drink at all or go out for meals etc and are more than happy at home with the kids.

People who say that when you are on benefits that you have loads of money truly have no fucking idea. There is not a week that goes by when I don't struggle or stress about money, or if I can make the difference on my rent.  And the hoops I have to ""jump"" through for Employment and Support allowance are unreal despite the fact I receive disabilty living allowance.

Let me also state that just because I am ESA at the moment does not mean I have accepted my lot in life. I am 90/360 points required for my degree at the open university and hopefully when I get this I can start working from home or something.

I wouldn't call the first gulf war ""nothing"".


The reason Saddam was on our hit list more than Kim Jong Il is because we had already intervened in Iraq (the first gulf war). We decided to give him another chance. We said ""destroy your WMDs and we'll let you keep your presidency"" in the hope that he would take a hint and chill out with the murdering and invading (by doing this the west also avoided having to spend money on a full scale invasion). But as time went on it was obvious that he was still a liability and we should have finished what we started.

Kim Jong Il on the other hand.... not our problem. We have little history with North Korea, so we lack the same kind of responsibility we did with Iraq. If anything were to be done it would mean fucking with China, and if there's one thing we do not want to do it's fuck with China. On top of the DPRK does a fine job of keeping its 'problem' relatively contained.

I agree it is very easy to list off all the problems about NI, we are not without our fair share. 

But I am not going to pretend to be an expert in economics or diplomacy or anything else. I tend to not like the fact that politicians like to hide behind hot-aired political rhetoric, often meaningless rhetoric. It is so easy to cite philosophers or historians or writers, harder to talk in actuality about solutions. 

I tend to like simple ideas, easy polices. To me the biggest issue that faces teenagers is severe unemployment and mental health issues. Job creation is a hard one to solve, I think we need more employability education in schools, coupled possibly with incentives for employers to consider young people. Apprenticeships and alternate routes to employment than just Uni need to be encouraged, as a one-size fits all approach does not work for everyone. 

I'd love to see organisations like Generation Innovation and the Northern Ireland Science Park be given more attention and support. We should be discouraging the 'brain-drain' of entrepreneurial talent that could be creating the next generation of SME's. 

In terms of Mental Health support, we need more public awareness that is IS a serious issue. We need to target support at males, especially under 25's and tackle the social stigma we have in this country about talking about our problems and emotions.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"For me, I felt the Huddlestone substitution was a great call. When the opposition is bunkering down, a Pirlo-esque player such as THudd is great for breaking down an organized defense. He completed passes that today that were absolutely sublime. Whether it was switching play 70 yards away or just recycling the ball, Huddlestone was great. When he came on, we looked far more dangerous and the Everton defense was a little more stretched. 

Credit has to go to Everton for how well organized they were at the back today, but one word came to mind in regards to our efforts to try and break them down: **STAGNATION**.  We looked stagnant. How many slow lazily lofted and unimaginative balls were played into the box just for shits and giggles today? Too many. There were many times when I'd have a look and see Holtby and Dempsey stacked on top of Ade in the box. It was pretty pathetic. Spurs players stood around as if expecting someone else to make an incisive or dangerous run, rather than make it themselves. One of the few players to semi-consistently make those runs today? Scott Parker.  Why is a box-to-box defensive minded midfielder attempting to make more runs into dangerous areas than the likes of Dempsey, Gylfi and Holtby? I get that it's asking for an expenditure of energy and you're not going to receive the ball every single time, but you're creating havoc and creating space. To boot, the ball movement was slow. I don't know if the ball movement was slow because of a lack of runs, or if there was a lack of runs because of the slow ball movement; it's a real which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg situation. When someone is attempting to bunker down with a lead, communication at the back is absolutely key. When you're constantly making runs and recycling runs, the communication becomes frantic and eventually someone will make a mistake.

 I also did not feel as if Spurs played very aggressive to try and make Everton uncomfortable in their defensive end. I'm sorry, but when Everton, a team strapped for pace, are bunkered down and their only outlet is Victor Fucking Anichebe, you don't have to fear the counter-attack as much as you normally would. You can afford to take a few more risks as a player of Anichebe's quality should be easily dealt with by Dawson and Caulker all day long.

Council tax has nearly trebled (comparing the average band D property)

Student grants paying to educate students still existed. In 1989 grants were turned into loans, in 1997, students were charged £1000 per year. Only a few grants remain. Today this is capped at (but largely used) £9000... not strictly a tax of course but still impacting on many.

There was also 0 rate vat on domestic gas and electricity. This was jumped to 8% in 1994 by Tories intending to raise it to 17.5% in line with vat, but the decision was unpopular and reduced to 5% in 1997 By Labour which has remained to date. But this is still 5% compared to the 80s 0%.

All types of insurance in the 80's came with interest where necessary, but no tax was added. In 94, 2.5% was then charged on top, today there are two rates, 6% for most applications and 20% for some others. Meanwhile as essential insurances like car insurance have gone up, so has the tax on that insurance.

What people are missing is that this is not about the figures. This is a poisonous brand of politics designed specifically to turn working people against those who do not or cannot work. 

Some people through no fault of their own cannot find work. Some regions do not have enough jobs per people. Some people have disabilities that make working impossible. That is what this simplistic proposition ignores. You cannot possibly judge whether £53 a week is liveable unless you consider each individual case. 

Asking people to make this judgement is irresponsible of the government. It is not the average person's place to decide how much is acceptable for the most vulnerable and needy to live on. That is why we usually have professionals who consider these cases regularly deciding what is the right amount. These professionals, meanwhile, are being made redundant because apparently councils are overstaffed and everyone knows the poor have far too much help already. 

TL; DR: The £53 a week debate is not about whether or not it is possible to live on that amount (it isn't). The real point is that by making that statement, the government are asking the average person to make a judgement they should never make: whether the poorest deserve what they get or not. 

The answer a lot of people will inevitably come out with is that they don't deserve £53 a week. And when the poorest and most vulnerable have their benefits slashed or removed outright, the government can justify it by saying that the average person has no problem with it.

Your post was reactionary and appears shows a complete disregard for putting two and two together.

To summarize your post:

* Suarez will leave because we don't have Europe. You completely ignore the fact that Suarez has stated multiple times that he is happy at Liverpool. The general consensus is that he will be here at least another season.

* *If* Suarez were to leave this summer, then your valuation of 25-30m for Suarez is criminally low. Thank god you're not running the club.

* ""Just recall Andy"" left me absolutely gobsmacked. Do you not read anything about the club? While I do not doubt Andy's talent, it is has been made clear by Rodgers and the club since the summer that Andy does *not* fit into our plans here at Liverpool. Watch Andy, watch the way we play in general, do you think Andy could really work? Maybe he could, but he can't be a development project at his age/wages.

* And we're certainly not 'set' on strikers with Carroll, Sturridge (still relatively unproven), and Borini (coming off a major injury and definitely unproven).

* And go to Ince? His dad claimed he's at 25m pounds. Shall we go for Ince then as our Suarez replacement?

* 'since i only watch the prem and dont see any of the good ones leaving to liverpool tbf' - This pretty much sums up the extent of your knowledge (or lack of).

My problem with what you've said is that citing just 5 articles does not examine the complete literature. You need a literature review and/or interviews with notable economists to get ant idea of a consensus. A biased sample of 5 articles is not representative. I can provide you with four pages of peer-reviewed journal articles from the back of the CEPR document - many of which are from some of the most highly regarded publications. But I don't really see the point in copy and pasting the tens of article names when I have already made the list available. Read the sources if you would like. If the CEPR is very biased it will become apparent very quickly.  Again, if you haven't had a look yet, the CEPR document doesn't contain new research, it simply summarises the key papers.

Now the CEPR exists to inform the public/politicians about developments in economics that are grounded in empirical observations. The CEPR is very intellectually honest. I hope, but severly doubt, that my word as an economist would be enough to validate that! The CEPR funds tonnes of research in the best universities in the world. The list of economists is current and (again you'll have to trust me) full of big names. Academics aren't always listened to by policymakers - the CEPR exists to address that.

People are either happy with the money they get for nothing, or are willing to ""stoop"" to get a job they can live off. Welfare puts people that don't deserve it in a position where they can see job openings and just think ""nah i'm not going to apply for that.""


I understand there are people that genuinely need it, but there are far too many people abusing it out of laziness.

And as for the basis of quitting, the JSA people really do not care in the slightest. Saying that, i've known parents to lose jobs and be denied JSA because their SO is on ""enough money"". 

Also, catering agencies have such a high turnover of staff they they take people without experience all the time. Unless of course they're places that cater to venues with a ridiculously high standard.

true,sizlo,null,null,"I lived in Wright Robinson in City Campus last year, 10-15 minute walk to main campus and right next to Piccadily station. Really good for nights out because I could always walk home. There would be the occasional parties but most people who lived there would go out instead. I think the other in City Campus there were about the same in that aspect. 

The rooms in wright rob were a decent size, single bed, alright sized wardrobe, massive desk (great if you have an elaborate desktop setup like me). I don't know about the rooms in other university owned halls in North campus (Fairfield and Lambert) but Weston Hall (owned by opal) had pretty tiny rooms but they had an ensuite. In wright rob it was 15 people to 4 toilets and 4 showers, I never had a problem with them all being in use when I needed them. There was one kitchen for all 15 people as well.

From what I heard from friends who lived in the Victoria Park halls is that they are more mellow. Parties were a lot rarer if you want to avoid them. As for rooms and kitchen stuff it varies a lot with those halls. Some are catered, some have en suites, others don't. The bedrooms in Canterbury Court were similar to mine but with an en suite. Hulme Hall had rooms a bit smaller than mine and the desks were tiny.

Fallowfield has a reputation of being party central, especially Owens Park. I've only been in any accommodation there once and the rooms were similar to mine in wright rob. Other than that there's not a lot I can say about Fallowfield halls, I'm sure other people can tell you a lot more.

This info is more or less pieced together from what my friends have said about living in certain halls and what I've seen. If you want any more info just ask.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;would be great if he took a wage cut and just lived on performance bonuses for a while, i think thats fair becuase i think he WILL perform if he's given a shot.

But that just doesn't make sense. I'm not entirely sure what sort of fantasy world you live in.

1. Rodgers doesn't want him.

2. Why would Big Andy take a pay cut when he could easily be paid his full wages elsewhere **and** start every weekend? Surely Big Andy (he's 24 years old and approaching the prime years of his career) has England ambitions and wants to return to his goal-scoring ways, that simply won't happen at Liverpool.

He will perform and he will be given a shot, just not a Liverpool.

true,socratees,null,null,"It is likely because people of pension age are very likely to vote, much more so than young people. Besides the majority of the welfare bill is not spent on penions, only 47% is. People often bring up rich pensioners but it is a red herring, is cutting their bus passes going to get rid of our debt? No.

The Tories are not trying to build a profile of what the average person on welfare is, they are simply trying to reduce the amount spent. It is not a class war at all. Have you even listened to what Osbourne said, he said that it is possible that the Philpot case is an example of wider  misuse of the system when prompted. The idea that the Tories are creating an 'us and them' is laughable and frankly makes me question 'Salvaxe's intelligence. Labour support exactly the same policy, moderate deficit reduction reduction that would have seen very similar cuts had they been in power. The idea that it is a bunch of posh boys attacking the poor and protecting their mates in the city is pathetic.
