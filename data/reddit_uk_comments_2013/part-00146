true,Killblue,tennant,Tennant,"I don't get hopeful about the backstory stuff. This is a fifty year-old show that has had dozens and dozens of show runners. Trying to create some theory that satisfies a lot of the canon may be a difficult task. I also don't want a theory that blatantly disregards aspects of *Who* canon. I don't know of a way to satisfy both of these requirements, so I'm happy with his past being his past.

I would kill for a good season. For my money, the only through-and-through great season of the new series is the fourth. Every other season struggles in one way or another, and, while having brilliant moments, they all wind up being just okay when you consider the sum of their parts. 

RTD's problem seemed to be foresight. He greenlit a lot of really terrible episodes. Some of them were probably pitched well (perhaps Daleks Take Manhattan or The Doctor's Daughter) and the problem lies in the script, whereas other episodes just have terrible premises (Fear Her, The Idiot's Lantern) and everything just goes downhill from there. He also relied a bit heavily on Daleks, if you ask me. I understand wanting to make sure they receive their due diligence, but it was excessive. Perhaps more prudent stewardship of the show could have led to the Dalek's appearance at the end of season four to be more astonishing. Those episodes are great, but there's a bit of a ""Oh, these guys again"" vibe about the Daleks at that point. RTD also loses points for completely botching a majority of Tenant's last story. That arc didn't need The Master AND the Time Lords. The end result was very confusing and anti-climatic. Still, David Tennant and Christopher Eccleston were always great no matter the quality of the episodes.

Moffat's main issue is perhaps inconsistency. Just look at how different each season is. Five is the most like the RTD stuff, but so many of the episodes just end up feeling like filler. The ""crack in the universe"" plot line was a bit obtrusive. Season six suffers from all the two-parters and the giant split between 6A and 6B. The show never gets to build momentum because the two seasons are so incredibly short. Seven is the worst of them. I don't care for the ""blockbuster"" approach to the season. I also do not understand the logic behind the Pond's departure and how the whole season was structured accordingly: ""Uh, three episodes blatantly screaming their departure, then they leave, then we take a few months off, do a Christmas special to introduce the mystery of the new girl, and then we take another few months off, and then we come back and wrap up her story in seven episodes."" 

I'm willing to give Moffat one last season to do something great, but after this, if he isn't replaced, I think I'm throwing in the towel as long as he stays in power.",0,1374164651,null,0,false,0,cb5aq5x,t3_1ijkjb,t1_cb5aq5x,t1_cb53g2o,null,1430422271,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Interestingly, 'buddy' evolved from the term 'butty' (to mean workmate, not sandwich) which was imported from Britain in the 19th century to the US by immigrant coal miners, but later fell out of common use here. So the word has a shared lineage with Britain that is not widely known.

The move to HD had previously been resisted for two major reasons: when the show was revived in 2005, high-definition television had not been adopted by an adequate portion of the audience to be financially viable; and special effects were considerably more expensive to create in high-definition than in standard-definition. ""Planet of the Dead"" was used as a switch to HD because of the show's reduced schedule in 2009 and because the filming crew had become experienced with the equipment while they were filming Torchwood.

Sorry.  I love Tennant, he is a great actor. But his last episode was horribly written from start to end. And the 15 minute farewell tour was ridiculously overdone. It was like they were trying to force the emotion. 

I don't mind the Doctor visiting a past companion to say goodbye, but not like they did it. Horrible. It was like a bad soap opera. 

I'm just thankful they didn't use the take of ""I don't want to go"" with him crying. That would have been worse.

The heat exchanger is gas powered but I'm not entirely sure how it works but we get billed monthly. Each flat has its own meter and heat exchanger which draws heat from the communal boiler and then its worked out by the management company and we get billed accordingly but its not expensive because the building is pretty warm. Same with water it comes from a single communal source rather than each flat having its own bristol water supply and that bill arrives quarterly.

&gt; If there is no pavement, keep to the right-hand side of the road so that you can see oncoming traffic. You should take extra care and

&gt; - be prepared to walk in single file, especially on narrow roads or in poor light

&gt; - keep close to the side of the road.

&gt; It may be safer to cross the road well before a sharp right-hand bend so that oncoming traffic has a better chance of seeing you. Cross back after the bend.


Less important on a road with pavements, however:

&gt; Where possible, avoid being next to the kerb with your back to the traffic.

i.e on the right-hand side of the road, and stay away from the edge of the kerb.

Groups are slightly different because you will occupy the road space, hence:

&gt; **Organised walks.** Large groups of people walking together should use a pavement if available; if one is not, they should keep to the left.  Look-outs should be positioned at the front and back of the group, and they should wear fluorescent clothes in daylight and reflective clothes in the dark.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;There are a series of words which, to me, seem like worthless social anthropology wank. 'Solidarity' is one of them.

I'm sorry if the word 'Solidarity' was too high brow for you

&gt;The US consulted lawyers, military chiefs, politicians and the international community before deciding upon their current course of action.

Talking of worthless wank words, please define the phrase ""international community"" and explain how they agreed to people being detained in Guantanamo Bay. Also ""lawyers"" as a group are far from unanimous is saying Guantanamo Bay is legal.

&gt;It has cost them a lot of time effort and money.

Oh really?! Well I guess we can't complain then. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars in general cost a lot of money, so we can't complain about them either. And any human rights abuses the US government commits in the future, any other of our citizens they decide to detain, I'll make sure not to complain if a lot of time, effort and money has gone into it.

&gt;Plus, the president won an election on the mandate of closing it then got re-elected when he said he couldn't do it even though he wanted to.

So if a politician wins an elections, this means anything they do is therefore right and above criticism? Another flawed argument.

&gt;Irrelevant and unbeneficial Protest is achieving absolutely nothing. 

As I said, if you are a Guantanamo Bay detainee, a hunger strike is about the only protest you can make. What have you got to lose, and what other option do you have other than accepting you indefinite detention.

As for Frankie Boyle, he's trying to raise awareness here so that our government does something, applies some pressure, to get  Shaker Aamer released or given a trial or even given better conditions.

Because the fucking president of the United States was elected on a platform of closing it. He had long term political and economic reasons for shutting the entire damn thing down. He didn't.

That is why I mentioned the president. Because he likes winning elections. And he had a fuck load more reasons to shut the thing down.

The problem with the death penalty is that mistakes happen and innocent people are executed. Now these guys are almost certainly going to be found guilty, but they are at the extreme end of the scale of evidence. People saw them do it, they admitted it in recordings. Almost bag to rights.

However, how far down the scale of evidence do you go before doubt starts to appear about how bang to rights other criminals are ? Innocent people have been executed in the past. Imagine being innocent of a crime and being put to death by the state.

If there's *any* chance of innocent people being executed then how can we, as a society, allow execution - even of people in broad daylight being filmed on phones ?

That doesn't do anything to back up the assertion, all it proves is that Muslims are on a whole either more inept at being criminals or they need better lawyers! :-p

You'll dismiss this as leftie crap, but it's well proven that for most countries the criminal jail population directly matches the proportions of their poor of the nation. In the USA that's black people while here in Scotland it's Catholics (16% of population, ~25% of prisoners).

I have seen quite a few comments across the subreddit and on /r/soccer where it seems like there's quite a bit of wishful thinking on our parts. Not to be a wet blanket, but we are kinda at a stage where our choices are a little limited. 

The knee thing with Papa is a double-edged sword. It kinda makes him more accessible for us, but could be a long term injury. That's a risk we have to take, so to speak. I think Suarez is the perfect example of a double-edged sword. He came to Liverpool with a very poor reputation, and while he has certainly repaid the club with his sterling performances, he has also reinforced that reputation with two embarassing scandals that have resulted in lengthy suspensions. 

Coutinho is another player who came with plenty of doubts, but ended up doing very well. It was, however, quite a bit of risk, only offset by how low his price was. 

While Muriel will cost 20m now, he is sure to cost closer to 30m in a year's time. Once again, bigger clubs might be holding off on players like him in case they are a one-season wonder, but this makes it prime time to swoop in for him now. 

I think if we wait for Suarez to leave, it will be too late. Other clubs know of Liverpool's predicament, and they will be sure to raise their prices. Although Suarez could possibly stay for another season, I sincerely doubt he is going to stay for longer, especially if we don't make Top 4 next season. Buying a replacement now gives us options. It prevents us from another deadline day debacle like what happened with Torres and helps keep our buying price low. I'm sure everyone here loves Suarez, but if he turns in a transfer request one week from September and skips training (like what he did at Groningen and like what Mascherano did), we would be royally fucked. 

Although we aren't in Europe this year, having a stronger squad can also help us get more matches in the League Cup and FA Cup, which in turns gives us more matches to spread around a bigger and better squad, keeping everyone happy. 

For us to really hit Top 4, we must really stop with the old mentality of having top players in each position for the first team, but totally nothing to back it up. Almost every single club in the Top 4 either has 2 very good players for each position, or are trying very hard to achieve that. (see Arsenal and their quest for a striker, even though they have Giroud, Podolski and Walcott, who scored 36 goals between them)

Some people think that you must reach Top 4 before you behave like a Top 4 club. I think that you must have a Top 4 squad before you can reach the Top 4. ",0,1374186446,null,0,false,0,cb5jrrw,t3_1il682,t1_cb5jrrw,t1_cb5j2pg,null,1430417954,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

The element of rape inheres in the violation of the victim’s will: ‘It’s not going to be the way you want it, but the way I want it; lie down and submit.’ They pry open the mouth with a flat disc, then broaden the crack between the jaws and insert a tube: ‘Swallow it.’ And if you don’t swallow it, they shove it farther down anyway and then pour liquefied food right down the esophagus. And then they massage the stomach to prevent the prisoner from resorting to vomiting. The sensation is one of being morally defiled, of sweetness in the mouth, and a jubilant stomach gratified to the point of delight.""

true,bookchaser,tardis,TARDIS,"Netflix is missing two episodes:

1. *Planet of the Dead* -- It's David Tennant, a few episodes before *The End of Time*. It's the origin of the he-will-knock-four-times theme. 

2. *A Christmas Carol* -- IMHO, the best episode since the reboot, with Matt Smith. You've seen Scrooge retold a million times on American TV. This episode underscores the difference quality writing (etc.) makes. It's highly inventive. It takes place at the end of Series 5, after *The Big Bang*.

Both episodes can be rent-streamed from Amazon without Prime.

If you have Prime, and have a Roku box, you can watch Series 7 part 1 for free. If accessed through Amazon's website, it's a rental. I don't know why. Lucky mistake?

Netflix has only through Series 6. 

We just finished Series 7, part 2. We're now awaiting the November 50th anniversary special, and the normally timed Christmas Day special. Sometime between now and then there will also be a historical drama about the origin of the show set in 1963 called *A Journey Through Space and Time*.

Having read the article and the relevant parts of the report it is reacting to, there are a couple of things that stand out. Primarily, that there is no mention of anything even approaching 'Sharia law' in either. The closest instance is the confrontation over the cooking of bacon, which just doesn't come close.

Then, what the article fails to really elaborate on, is the culture of fear that the report states muslims experienced after 9/11 and 7/7. This promoted the idea of sticking together, forming gangs, in order to combat the aggression that they faced.

The report even admits that it is based entirely on observed instances, not any recorded data. Thus, the evidence is circumstantial, and what findings are in the report are nothing like conclusive enough to apply to the wider prison population. It's not really conclusive enough to apply to Whitemoor.

He was apathetic and a disappointment for the majority of the season. An all too common pattern with his previous clubs.
I just don't get all these people that say ""He'll bounce back next year"" and ""he's the type of striker we need"" when this same pattern was evident at Arsenal, and Man City. You could even argue that both teams offering him CL football should have been even more incentive for him to perform, and yet both clubs were happy to see him go.
He continues to be inconsistent and disappear during games, after putting in a good season previously.

Yes he has the ability, but he has proven throughout his career that he lacks either the work ethic, or the desire to consistently put that ability to use.

The saying goes *Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.*
We're now the third team he's ""fooled"" and it's time we cut our losses and got that massive wage off our books so we can use that to bring in someone who's going to put in the effort day in and day out.

Sure you can offer up a number of excuses, injury, limited playing time, the ACON etc. But surely his history of ""not giving 100%"" and ""only playing for a contract"" should be a huge warning bell to anyone who thinks we should keep him.

That 100k/week would be much better invested in someone who we can trust to show up and score goals.

The bedroom tax is a new thing that was designed to solve the problem of people taking up a larger residence than they needed, it means that if you are deemed to have more bedrooms than you need, your housing benefit will be reduced, and therefore will not cover all of your rent. As social housing is in short supply, it's mostly only occupied by people with a specific priority need, and they are only receiving housing benefit because they aren't  / can't work or can't earn enough to pay the rent themselves, so they're stuck really.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"[93% of new housing benefit claims between Jan 2010 and Dec 2011 were made by people in work](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/majority-of-new-housing-benefit-claimants-in-work/6521183.article) - if you can't afford reasonable housing, maybe you should claim.

People out of work don't just get handed houses with spare bedrooms. Generally, we're talking about people who've been in the same home for many years - even decades. People whos children have moved out in particular.

One problem with the bedroom tax is that there simply aren't enough studios and one bedroom flats available, at least not without ""no DSS"" conditions attached. Just as the Tories claim that a few available jobs will magically become millions if you give the jobseekers the right motivation, they claim that a few available single bedroom flats will magically become millions if you give homeseekers the right motivation.

I say ""claim"" because it's clear that they're really not that stupid. The point is to make disabled people and other unemployed people into scapegoats for the economic problems caused by politicians and bankers.

The dole dosser culture is a fantasy you've been sold by newspapers and politicians. A few of those people exist, but it's nowhere near the scale the papers claim.

The claimant count ([number of people receiving Jobseekers Allowance](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/labour-market/people-not-in-work/claimant-count)) is highest in the North-East (7.2%) and lowest in the South-East (2.7%) - [source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-labour/regional-labour-market-statistics/june-2013/index.html). The regional variation is obviously due to availability of jobs in different areas.

The numbers of [long-term unemployed have varied dramatically over time](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/United-Kingdom/indicator-SL.UEM.LTRM.ZS/), clearly reflecting changes in the economy and government policy, *not* huge shifts in the peoples personalities. After Camerons election, the long-term unemployment rate jumped from 24.4% to 32.6% in a year.

From [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending), we can put the cost of benefits in context...

    Pensions ...................... 74.22 bn
    Housing benefit ............... 16.94 bn
    Disability Living Allowance ... 12.57 bn
    Jobseekers Allowance ..........  4.91 bn

And don't forget, the housing benefit problem was mostly caused by the Tory sell-off of council houses starting back in the 80s (though Labour chose not to stop it when they had the chance, of course) and by the banking crisis.

Here's how long you wait for Council/housing association housing in Medway, Kent, if you're band D (no special priority)...

                                        Shortest    Longest     Average
    D   Sheltered accomm.        21    5 weeks     5 years    17 months
    D   1-bed general needs       8    6 months   11 years    27 months
    D   2-bed flat or maisonette  7    4 months    3 years    13 months
    D   3-bed flat or maisonette  2   11 months   25 months   18 months

[Source](http://www.cblettings.org/ReportsKent/template/ReportWaitingTimeForLastYear.xml?MemberPartnerID=14) - I'd give a better link but you'd need my password to access it.

Yes, you'll be searching 27 months *on average* for a 1-bed general needs flat. That first number is the number of homes let in the last year - 8 properties in a year in an area with a population of about 250,000 people. Other categories still aren't good, but at least they're not that bad. Those are *all* band D lettings in the last year - not exactly handing them out willy-nilly, are they?

Of course families with children aren't in band D unless they're already in adequate housing, but that doesn't mean Daddies a dole dosser either. People who were in work have lost their jobs. That's how unemployment increases, and it could happen to you too.

Some people were even made unemployed because they were replaced by free labour done by the unemployed - great scheme, eh, putting people out of work and making people work for free in the name of fighting unemployment.

This case however is different to both the Norwegian one and the Bulger one for the reason is was thought out, the consequences were clearly understood by the attacker etc. It's less likely that he feels guilt for his actions.

Lee Rigby was targeted because he believed that Rigby, as part of the armed forces, was an individual helping to bring immense suffering to the Muslim world, creating widows, orphans, and leaving families ruined.

In his eyes, this was a tit-for-tat revenge killing. He killed him in revenge for the death of people in the middle east. Regardless of how valid you believe the role our army have in the region, and regardless of how much they try to avoid innocent loss of life, it is an indisputable **fact** that innocent civilians have died. I am not making an argument for **or** against British activity in the middle east, but simply pointing out certain facts.

Do you see how broken this makes your reasoning? They killed because of death happening in the middle east, and you want to continue that violence? You want to keep the cycle going? Not only do you want to further the violence, but you also want to escalate it from murder to torture and deliberate maiming?

In his eyes, he killed Lee Rigby because Lee Rigby was a murderer. In his eyes, Lee Rigby left children without parents.

BTW, pretty sure the EDL do go on about muslim gangs in prisons converting people.

true,Gustyarse,null,null,"I'd like to disagree - I've seen the joke and I did not think it was racist.  Basically, imo, humour is most frequently the juxtaposition of the expected and the unexpected.  Comedians upset the social mores of the day by producing the unexpected.  I am very strongly of the opinion that people should understand that in producing that juxtaposition, comedians are making shit up.  It's not real.  It's just a way of creating that connection that doesn't normally exist.  It's how humour works.

I'm not saying that people can't be offended by jokes; sometimes, a joke will hit on something that a person has experienced or for whatever reason, brings back bad memories or reminds them of something awful.  I've experienced that, and it's not very pleasant.

In spite of this, I don't think that we should censor humour.  We should just make sure that you know what sort of material someone does.  If it's not your thing, don't watch it.

It's a bit like gay sex.  It's not really my thing, so I don't watch it, and I don't perform it.  But I have no issue with consenting adults doing it in private.

&gt;I don't think we need to make a marque signing to push forward. we don't need an erikson or a david villa or anything. we have a top four squad. 

I'm not so sure. I would like to believe this, but the xi you posted is virtually the same as the one that got us 7th this past year. Even if you just look at the second half of the season (when we had studge and coutinho), we still weren't in the top 4. I think this squad *could* place in the top 4 with the right bounces over the course of a season. But a real top 4 squad wouldn't need the lucky bounces. 

I agree we are now deeper than we were, but I don't think any of the guys we've added so far are going to make a big enough impact to really change our ranking. 

That said, I don't think we need a ""marquee"" signing necessarily; we could also just have a couple of under-the-radar impact signings like coutinho

true,shelteredsun,null,null,"Symbols can indeed change meaning over time, after all they only have the meaning that people invest in them, so it's a worthy question to consider.

In this particular situation the way I look at it is, if you were aware of the distinction between the two, would you still use the Caduceus?

The Rod of Asclepius definitely means doctor, it is clear and unambiguous and has meant that for nearly 3000 years. The Caduceus means commerce and trickery and has meant that for 3000 years, but *also* in the last 100 years it has (primarily in America) been used sometimes to mean 'doctor' because of confusion between the two symbols.

So you could say it's colloquial in the sense that many people would know what was meant by the Caduceus in this context, however you could argue that it's just due to the similarity between them. People know that the doctor's symbol involves snakes and a staff in some way but they're probably pretty fuzzy on the details. A similar example would be people colloquially understanding any swastika to mean 'Nazis' without knowing the differences between the Hindu swastika and the Nazi swastika. In both of these situations knowledge of the dominant historical meaning would typically change the 'colloquial' use, suggesting that the alternate meaning comes from ignorance and confusion rather than a true meaning shift.

And that's probably more than you wanted to read, but I did think about that before I posted originally and thought it was an interesting topic!",0,1374210239,null,0,false,0,cb5rpzp,t3_1ijf93,t1_cb5rpzp,t1_cb58mpc,null,1430414117,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"&gt; Germans are generally pretty nice to talk with too.

After my stay with some German friends (well my mum's German friend and her family), speaking to her new partner, from an older generation and so doesn't speak English, although it was a challenge talking to him it was great fun - it also improved my German! 

It was great talking to him, and he would help me with what objects were called. Towards the end, as I was the only one really trying (my mum was just throwing the few words she knew at and not being as curious as I was, trying to further sentence structure and actually doing them) I greatly improved by the time we left and although my speaking was very basic, it was great being able to finally communicate with him much more effectively. 

Plus, getting rather close to my mum's friend's daughter, she was teaching me some German (it's been years since I've touched it and although I did reasonably well at school, I've essentially forgotten everything), so that really helped and aside from that specifically, it's all made me want to learn the language again. I would definitely be going back to stay with them in the future, so becoming more knowledgeable about the language and hopefully fluent is a must for me!

Seeing them all speak English (aside from the 71 year old man) better than my German, and the daughters (15+18) being younger than me (19), it has really made me want to be able to talk with them in their first language as they did for us.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;It is the comparison that has always irritated one of English football's great superpowers. For 20 years, Manchester United were judged by the standards Liverpool set; invariably, they came up short. For the past two decades, after a swift, stark role reversal, the Merseysiders have been damned by appraisals against the Mancunians.

&gt;But football is comparative; otherwise, the league table would have little relevance. And a look of the two clubs' record in the transfer market over the Premier League era indicates why United's superiority is now entrenched.

This may not be a popular column in this subreddit but I think Richard Jolly of ESPNFC.com has done a good job breaking down how Manchester United has succeeded in the transfer market while Liverpool's transfer dealings have had mixed results (for a variety of understandable reasons, of course).

One criticism of Jolly's piece is that while he clearly enumerates the faults and the challenges Liverpool have faced over the years, his conclusion to his column doesn't really acknowledge that we are on the right track, that we're on a steady forward progression and that is something that should be exciting for Liverpool supporters as well as the entire Premier League and Europe. A strong and successful Liverpool team is good for football on so many levels. And we are tantalizing close to returning to where we need to be.

For the parts that hold the 2 tubes I painted 4 of these black http://media5.rsdelivers.cataloguesolutions.com/LargeProductImages/C176078-63.jpg

I nailed them onto the belt with a stretchy piece of fabric inbetween so it would be able to hold things in-between the 3 hole brackets. 

For the 2 box shaped things I used aluminium tins, I sprayed them both silver and for the first one I just got a bunch of washers, nuts and bolts and attached them to the box using glue. For the second one I found an old microchip and nailed it onto the box. I used more nuts and bolts for the top of it. Painted over both of these with brown and black/grey acrylic paint with a bit of gold for some weathering. 

For the other holders I used these http://www.plumbase.com/s_product_images/L99953_1_P006874_RM326G.jpg
and attached them to the belt, the ones I have are quite flexible so it's easy to fit stuff in there.

You can put in a request for their service record and pay a small fee (they actually have to go digging through old paper archives and files to find this stuff), but there’s no guarantee they’ll locate anything. It’s also much, much harder for them if you’ve just got a name to go on, not a unit or division or any other form of ID.

Have you no boxes of old stuff from the period that might contain old records? I only know my Grandfathers unit because they gave him an engraved silver cigarette box on his engagement with their names attached.

Also, I think they only accept requests from immediate family, so it would have to be put in under your mother’s name. Have a read of [this stuff]( https://www.gov.uk/requests-for-personal-data-and-service-records).

After the Third Reich collapsed, food and other items were very hard to get. The looting by the Soviets - who were also tired, hungry and homesick after months of fighting - made the situation even worse. When the British forces arrived, distribution of food and clothing was given the top priority. They picked a local castle as their HQ instead of the Soviets which used the former Nazi HQ which helped to show their style and distance to the former rulers.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"Quite simply this.

If someone rents from a private landlord and is on a low income/benefits they are entitled to aid from the state to pay the rent. Originally it was called Housing Benefit and was calculated on the rent you paid which lead to outragous anomolies such as a single person living in a 3 bedroom house in an expensive area getting virtually all their rent paid. 5 years ago this was changed and is called Local Housing Allowance. The LHA unlike Housing Benefit before it is a fixed amount paid on the number of bedrooms needed depending on your household circumstances and is calculated based on local average rents. So if you need 2 bedrooms and rent a 2 bedroom property in an average rental, you'll pay nothing. If you rent in a cheaper than average you may end up with some money in your pocket and if you rent in an expensive area you have a shortfall you have to make up. Sounds fairer and ends the farcical situation of unemployed people being able to rent a mansion in Kensington.

However when the LHA was introduced, this limit did not apply to those renting social housing (council houses) provided by the State and their proxies, housing associations but this has recently been addressed, hence the cries of ""unfair"" even though those shouting were actually the ones getting an unfair advantage for the last half decade.

The ""bedroom tax"" isn't actually a tax at all but is nothing more than bringing those renting social housing into line with those renting from private landlords - the aid the state pays will now be set based on the housing requirements of the tenant, not how much rent they pay. It is balancing a half decade old unfair advantage that has existed to those who rent social housing.

Is that a 4-2-2-2? Not sure if the manager/team has ever played it before. So changing to that will essentially rule out any shot at a title run. 

As far as going for the CL title is concerned, the teams that win that - Barca, Bayern etc. They have squads PACKED with players of Bale's quality. Hell, up until January I rated Ribery higher than Bale, and he is just another face on the Bayern squad.

The following players would need to be relegated to the bench and new faces brought in to challenge for CL. Walker, Kaboul, BAE (probably not good enough for CL bench), Lennon and Benteke. 

Even then, with the squad you named, where does the creativity come from. Who is the Modric, the Siggy or the Holtby?

EDIT: My squad for a league run, champions league isn't possible in forseeable future.

The team plays a highline 4-3-3 with AVB but can switch to a defensive 4-3-3 or a counter attacking 4-2-3-1.

Players in would be Baines for £13m, Modric back for £35m, Kiessling for £10m and Jovetic £22m (I know he is now gone). But that is going to cost like £55m.

Local authorities made 2,605 requests, ""less than 10 per year per authority"". 93% of these were for subscriber information only.

2,379 were made by other authorities, 55% by the Financial Services Authority.

Generally, discipline was considered of utmost importance in the British occupying forces (not to say that some soldiers didn't get up to anything, but not only was it unsanctioned, perpetrators were punished). It always had been because this would allow the army to maintain order by example, to react well to any situation and autonomously where necessary (i.e., without the need for continuous direct supervision). An army with loose discipline is really a liability as they will do their own thing and not be able to maintain order.

&gt;When the British forces arrived, distribution of food and clothing was given the top priority.

Without the cooperation of the populace, the occupation would have been difficult. After destroying the infrastructure the British had to prioritise remedial work to prevent deaths from cold and starvation.

&gt;It also helped that many British soldiers knew German.

Thanks for the confirmation. I had wondered a little about ordinary soldiers speaking German from the original article.

He says we new to buy better than our rivals/competition and right now challenging for 4th place with us are Arsenal and Spurs, they're our rivals and we've had a more productive summer.

If Bale and Suarez stay it's great for both clubs, considering Arsenal don't have anyone in that calibre I think that's a thing that sets them back. But of course they do have the CL and apparently a £70m budget to entice a superstar to join. But you can be linked with the best players in the world over and over again but if you don't make a move by September 2nd then you've missed out and your squad hasn't improved.

Liverpool signed 4 with 2 outgoings so far. Net spend around £3m
Tottenham signed 1 with no outgoings. Net spend around £17m
Arsenal signed 0* with 2 outgoing. Net spend £0m

Each club has more money to spend and probably will use it but everything can still change with the possibility of big players leaving.

I think so far that we've built a squad that will finish ahead of Arsenal but behind Tottenham. It will be very close, so close of fact that even a 2-3 week injury at the wrong time could end someone's hope of champions league. 4th place awaits.

*Arsenal have signed Yaya Sanogo but I don't believe he'll big make enough appearances/a big enough impact to have an effect on Arsenal or the table. That's why he went unmentioned in the signings.

Van Manh!

Actually I'm not really, fractured my radial head the other day, so typing is hard.  But beginner Vietnamese doesn't cover that!

&gt; In the sense that the poor now are proportionately poorer than the poor then in relation to their wealthy, then yes, it is, that's exactly what it's saying and it's undoubtedly correct.  We've had a situation worse than the teens/20s jazz-age for a considerable time, so that takes us well beyond the austerity of the 2nd world war years.

But where is the data for that?  It's not in that ONS data set.

In fact our idea of poor is really something to be proud of, immensely so.  Poor have all the food they need, accommodation, smartphones etc, unless they have very poor money management or need any mental/addiction help.  Then we treat them like shit.  But this isn't new.

&gt;We can look at waste, but the biggest problem is we've almost entirely ceased trying to tax wealth and instead decided to tax working people. We no longer tax wealth nor corporations, but instead working incomes and individuals

Well that is a good thing, taxing corporations is *non-progressive*.  Ultimately I believe rich people only should pay tax with poorer people being largely exempt, we need to get rid of NI from poorer people too.  But corporation tax has an effect similar to VAT, but it is also on essentials.  There has never been a 'managed' economy which has provided bread as cheaply or consistently as private enterprise.  Why tax the entity, tax only those who profit from it.  Abolish CGT and just have universal income tax (do away with NI).  Why does someone with a trust fund pay less on the same received monies than someone who has a full time job!

Taxing wealth is an odd one, because we sort-of do.  Spend anything odds are VAT kicks in.  Sell anything CGT (should be income imsho).  Taxing people on paper wealth is hard, I'm starting a new company now, my share could be seen as £250k based on idealistic thinking or -£15k (ie debt) based on reality.  Only with a financial services industry (MTM) can that worth be actualised, and then only at my / business partners discression.  So taxing it until it is, is impractical.

Then you come to another issue.  If one person has £100k of assets, another £10M is he really 100 times richer?  Being philosophical I would suggest no, assets tend not to have a linear relationship and are rarely transitive as the 'set' of things you can buy is irreflexive.  This property only shows itself in larger monetary sets.

An example would be houses in a street, there are 100, and our two people live there, obviously if one unit was £100k, the £10M wouldn't be enough come the end of the street, even if the sale was brokered with options.  The 'gap' has to be relative to something, cars are a great example, what is the difference in lifestyle between a £6k car and a £120k aston martin?  Twenty times wealth difference, not much in life.

The next stage would be to do something to actually increase the housing available, but that requirement would be reduced by getting people in places of the right size to start with. 

The lack of housing is the primary problem. It should have been tackled first. Any improved efficiency in distribution will be absolutely minimal until there are more houses. It's repairing the suspension before making sure the car has 4 wheels.

Agencies also hardly ever ask why you've been out of work for so long, they'll assume it's just because you couldn't find anything good and are now so desperate you'll give warehousing a chance! Previous physical work is of course a good thing to have too, mention that in the cover letter as well.

If you want it soon try looking in the window of local agencies, they often have vacancies there that they have not yet bothered to advertise online. And if the first job is awful (Caterpillar Logistics comes to mind, now Neovia, as well as Argos and any supermarket) don't be afraid to quit without notice and move to a different job with a different agency - the only joy of being a temp! Eventually you'll hopefully find a decent place to work (Unipart springs to mind..).

Perhaps a silly question but is there no more scaffolding work?

Private enterprise, of course, is primarily motivated by profit whilst, in theory, government services are primarily motivated by social and economic welfare. 

Obviously, you can pick holes in the theory of welfare and government services as they are not currently living up to their responsibilities and the social contract, but the fact is that we could elect a government / local government that does perform the expected duties of a government.

We wrapped up the Empire with military theory, the European balance of power and Revolutions and finally the lead up to the first and second world wars. The rest was mostly different interpretations  of history and the politics of the Cold War focusing on East Germany as a test case. There was a certain deal of post-colonial guilt, but it was very much about understanding it objectively rather than ""it was bad."" We got a lot of mileage from it, but it was more a back drop rather than ""here's the empire."" 

I must agree with other posters about the US though, they were more of a footnote, and demonstrated how Britain prefer cost effective economic imperialism rather than anything important. I must also note that I did it rather recently and things have certainly changed educationally the last decade, what with us learning modules and coursework rather than just tests, so I think you get more of an overview nowadays of the Empire if the teachers chooses so.

Not 50 years ago (49 to be exact), he would have been hanged. And good fucking riddance to bad rubbish.

See the thing is, the argument against the death penalty has always been ""what if we hang the wrong man ?"". Our justice system is based upon ""guilty beyond all reasonable doubt"", and as we've seen countless times, maybe due to our police working to targets and ratios rather than their original designation of ""peacekeepers"", the wrong men have been incarcerated.

But I would like to see a more rigorous sentence possible to be handed down, namely ""guilty beyond ALL doubt"" - as you get in cases with multiple witnesses, video testimony, and the fact the police didn't have time to corrupt or beat a false confession to meet a damn quota. This guy took a life. In cold blood (the coldest). In front of multiple eye witnesses.

There is no doubt he is guilty (even without a trial), there is no doubt he is unrepentant, and there is no doubt that he is a danger to society and needs to be given a life sentence. But what of justice to the victim ? An eye for an eye merely leaves the world with one eye and a sense of right and wrong - something we seem to have forgotten in our eagerness to protect the ""rights of the accused"", while ignoring the rights of people not to be fucking beheaded in the high street.

There are many reasons why Negredo can score just as many for us as he did for Seville. I'm hoping for more.

Both of the aforementioned Spaniards don't command regular first team places for Spain, the world champions.

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"This strike is shaping up to be bigger than the 2002 strike, and this one is for different reasons. 2002 was about firefighters going to the government and saying ""we deserve more money."" That was very arguable. I was not a firefighter at the time, but am thankful that my £13 per hour is on them and the action they took. The public did actually benefit a lot from it too, as a result, the role of a firefighter changed. The fire service became the fire &amp; rescue service. They received mandates to attend more incident types as part of the negotiations, more training, and increased responsibilities. The Fire Service Act 2004 reflected this.

This strike, should it happen is not about us saying ""we want more"". This is about the government saying ""We taking x away from you."" x in this case being a good pension, our jobs if we hit 55 and age becomes an issue, and therefore pensions are lost. There's also a whole host of budget cuts arriving. Stations will close. Response times will increase. That is terrible for the public and terrible for firefighters.

I don't want to strike, but given that the government are not negotiating, I feel there is no other option.

There were 2 options for firefighters here. Accept the governments proposals, receive a worse pension, accept conditions that are less safe for us and the public. Or ballot for a strike.


The hope is that the ballot will force the government to negotiate, rather than leave the public protected by desk jockeys given helmets for a day and the few non union members there are.",0,1374238649,null,0,1374239666,0,cb5x1vy,t3_1imi96,t1_cb5x1vy,t1_cb5weeg,null,1430411534,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

I received the mark only last week and I have 28 days to appeal if I wish. 

I plan on going through the assessment regulations for my University over the weekend and seeing if any of they have fallen short on any of them. In my view I think that the tutor in question took a dislike to me because I really didn't rate this module as I think it was biased towards some people rather than others. 

The other issue is that I was one of the few that kept emailing asking for my feedback as I was conscious of the appeal date and therefore I am only aware of two others that have actually got feedback for this individual module rather than the overall grade. 

The two people in charge have now gone on holiday so there is little chance of getting other people's marks back before September which by then it will be too late!

true,chub79,eu,Brittany,"&gt; Private enterprise, of course, is primarily motivated by profit whilst, in theory, government services are primarily motivated by social and economic welfare.

Whilst I think a public service shouldn't be motivated by profit, it would do everyone some good if it was responsibly used and implemented though. I dislike the idea of core services such as education, social care, healthcare to be privatised. Yet, I don't mind that we consider making them more efficient while providing an equally good service.

Maybe, my point may be misunderstood so I'll take an example. In France, we have local councils providing help to disable people. But the system has a hole, people benefiting it are hardly checked or monitored. In other words, if I go to my local GP and he signs the appropriate papers stating I'm depressed, I can apply for benefits. Plenty of people are abusing it. Not only does it cost money but it also slows down the process for those in real needs.

This example demonstrates two things in my mind:

* If people resort to those sort of schemes, the feeling they have within our society isn't good. Why is that? What are they feeling left out?
* Why the hell don't the local council or government spend more money in ensuring the system is not abused like that?

You won't be jailed if you can prove you are the victim of rape. The problem with the recent case with the Norwegian woman is that there was no evidence she was raped so she could not secure a conviction. 

Personally I believe her but if you want someone to be convicted of rape (which is treated very seriously in UAE - they still have the death sentence for rape in extreme cases), you have to be able to prove it in court.

However both her and the accused did admit to having sex so they got prosecuted separately for sex outside marriage. Still fucked up, admittedly, but not quite the same.

There have been multiple convictions for rape in Dubai so it is not like rapists get away with it. Here are some examples:

As I explained in a separate post, 2002 was about firefighters saying ""we want more!"" this time it is about the government saying ""you deserve less!"".

Wages were increased. Wages before 2002 were £21k. They asked for £30k, the agreement came to £28k. That is wholetime firefighters. 60% of the country is defended by part-time firefighters (known as retained or on-call firefighters) who do the same job, but only work when called upon, rather than staying on station. The on-calls (which I am) were paid on a totally different and less scale. This was leveled out, so now all firefighters get £13 per hour. This is fair.

The Fire Service became The Fire &amp; Rescue Service. This is really important. Before, the fire service has a responsibility to attend fire incidents. The rescue was added and increased that responsibility to take control of water rescue, traffic collisions, terrorist (CCBRN) attacks and other incident types. The Fire service Act of 2004 reflects the increased responsibilities of firefighters in that time.

As I say, I was not in during 2002 and am not familiar with all the arguments them. I was but a mere child.

My Wife pulled up next to a bunch of picketing firemen during the last strike in her uniform and asked 'how would you like it if I decided you didn't need treatment for burns when you were brought in because I wanted a better-paid job?'

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"The bedroom tax thing is just a sticking plaster on the housing problem, not a solution. If the government invested in council properties, didn't allow people to buy them, and charged rent based on what the occupants can afford rather than market prices, then we'd soon see housing problems sorted out. Here's how I envision it:

1. Single parent loses job, moves into council house. With income of Jobseeker's Allowanc and Child benefit, they can't afford to pay rent, so rent is £0.

2. This person then finds part time work, 16 hours a week at minimum wage; their job income is about £100 a week. They still get child benefit, they lose jobseeker's. The jobseekers allowance amount (about £73) is left as what the parents needs to survive; one third of the rest - about £9 a week in total - is paid for rent.

3. This person later gets full time work at slightly above minimum wage, supervising a small team of part time workers. Their income is now £300 a week plus child benefits. The jobseekers level is still protected, and one third of the rest after tax is paid for rent - about £65 a week.

4. This person is promoted or gets a pay rise; they now earn £500 a week from their job. After a certain threshold, they don't get the jobseeker's allowance level protected any more (probably best staggered here) so now, after tax, they're paying about £130 a week in rent for a two bedroom flat. Lets say that the local market rate/ private rent for a similar property in a similar area is £110. They now have a choice: stay in the council flat paying £20 a week over the odds, because it's familiar and all their friends are nearby and so on, or move into a private let around the corner and save £20 a week. If they stay, they're helping to subsidise the council flat system now by paying over the odds, reducing the government's outgoings. If they move, they pay £20 a week less.

The difference between what now happens and this solution is that private landlords don't get govenment money. If you can afford to live in private housing, you do, if you can't, you go into a council property. Thus if private landlords charge too much, they lose renters rather than getting housing benefit from the government via their tenants. Those who need help get it, but have to be open about their finances.

The problem is that this requires a lot of investment, some serious management, and a change in how things work. Landlords will oppose it because it will result in lower rents, and the Tories won't like it because it involves a lot of government or local council involvement. In terms of how much it costs, that could fluctuate; there must be sufficient council properties that anyone who needs one can get one, which means a lot of money will need to be invested up-front. And it means that the amount of money it costs will be higher during troubled times and lower in boom times. So it does have its disadvantages.

The biggest problem I see, though, is those who aren't interested in working and are happy to live in a council flat without having a job. This is where a different step in things comes in.

I know Workfare is hugely unpopular, and rightly so. But how about this as an alternative: anyone who has been on JSA for more than 6 months is expected to work for a non-profit organisation such as Oxfam, a local community beautification scheme and so on for 8 hours a week, either as one 8-hour day or two 4-hour days. Anyone on JSA over 1 year has to do 16 hours and over 2 years has to do 24 hours a week. This will always be with a non-profit group, in a role which could not be paid. Any adult living in a council flat, not claiming JSA or ESA and not disabled, and working fewer than 24 hours a week will be expected to work 4 hours a week (over 8 hours paid work a week) or 8 hours a week (under 8 hours paid work), in similar circumstances.

What this does is it means that those who don't want to work still do something, it keeps those who are geniunely trying to find work in a routine and used to working, even if not as much as a full time job, and it means that organisations that need help get it, and there are people working in local communities to keep their area looking nice, which helps everyone.

This whole systems means that:

1. Landlords aren't able to charge whatever they like knowing that if their tenant can't pay, the government will. Private rents are controlled as supply deminishes if rates go too high.

2. Everyone who needs housing can get it.

3. Those inclined to abuse the system have to contribute to society and work some time each week to continue getting support.

4. Those unable to work don't have to.

5. Council housing is stable - the properties can't be sold, and once someone is enough money that they can move into private lets, they either move, releasing their former property for someone else, or pay above the odds, helping fund new building of council properties.

It's not perfect and requires work, but as a framework I think it has the potential to solve some of the problems facing the welfare system.

Code | Description
:--|:--
Green — Summer preparedness and long-term planning | This is the minimum state of vigilance during the summer. During this time social and healthcare services will ensure that all awareness and background preparedness work is ongoing.
Yellow — Alert and readiness | Triggered as soon as the risk is 60% or above for threshold temperatures being reached in one or more regions on at least two consecutive days and the intervening night. This is an important stage for social and healthcare services who will be working to ensure readiness and swift action to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.
Amber — Heatwave action | Triggered when the Met Office confirms threshold temperatures for one or more regions have been reached for one day and the following night, and the forecast for the next day is greater than 90% confidence that the day threshold will be met. This stage requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups.
Red — Emergency | Reached when a heatwave is so severe and/or prolonged that its effects extend outside the health and social care system. At this level, illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, and not just in high-risk groups.

Because he already is. I am not sure how much of Higuain you have seen over the years but 190 games for 107 goals and 45 assists is beyond amazing stats. Did I mention he can pass/dribble/hold up, the definition of the perfect striker. He has done it for years as well and is only 25!

Even this one (yes one!) golden season from Benteke was worse than a quiet one from Higuain. I know one played for Villa and the other Madrid. But Villa had a team built around Benteke, Higuain was 4th or 5th fiddle.

To further my point that Higuain &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Benteke. Higuain's season at the same age (22) was FAR better than the one Benteke just had, less games played for 27 goals and 7 assists. Almost twice as prolific.

&gt;Benteke has gotten better and better as he ages and thus could become better than Higuain.

Very much doubt. Benteke has only had one good season and even then it was worse than Higuains at the same age. He could become better, but so could Coulibaly, or Ben Yedder, or Bony etc.

The difference between a stocks-and-shares ISA and a normal investment account is tax. Normally you would have to pay tax on the income and profits you make on your investments. You don’t have to if you keep your investments inside an ISA.

There is one limitation that comes with this tax benefit: you can only invest a certain amount of money in any tax year (currently £11,520). If you’ve invested the maximum amount and then you withdraw some money, you can’t put it back in again until the next tax year.

You can either choose the investments to keep in you ISA yourself, using a *self-select* stocks-and-shares ISA, or you can go for a ready-made packaged product.

How you invest will very much depend upon a range of factors. Most important of which are time scale and your attitude to risk. If you can provide a bit more information on those, then I will try to offer some more advice.

I kind of wish we would make some good under the radar signings like Micky's old team always seem to do. There was a post from Walsh on ESPNFC that made it on here yesterday pretty much echoing that. While a marquee signing would be fantastic, making some shrewd signings would be ideal. That seems to be the new model anyway. The buy low, and sell high if we eventually have to sell. 

I know people are split on if we are trying to run a similar model in a sense as say BVB, Ajax, Shakhtar, etc. I would say in terms of the concept of having quality players worth more than what you paid is the idea FSG seem to be going for and so far.

I do hope obviously that we can make good on BR's statement that he wants a couple of signings that improve the starting 11.

Again sure, other pensions have been attacked, but we are in the position to be able to fight it. The idea of this ballot is not to strike, but to force a negotiation, which has not been forthcoming yet.

&gt;For example, in some countries (Germany, IIR), when the bus drivers go on strike, they don't stop work - they just stop taking money from the public. Now that can't obviously be directly applied to the fire services, but the principle is sound

I agree that is a good idea, and totally possible for bus drivers. If you have an idea that can be done by the fire service I would love to hear it and I'm sure the FBU would too.

As for your wife. It's a shame she decided to go for a 'gotcha' question, rather than delving into the deeper issues. It's also a shame that the firefighter she spoke to was a bit of a mong.

Personally, if your wife pulls up to me in September, or whenever these strikes happen, whenever they may be, and asks me that same question I would reply with

""I would not like it at all ma'am. But you do an important and respected job, that is essential to this country, and you deserve excellent pay and working conditions, so you can do your best work for those in need. I would respect and understand your decision and fully appreciate that it will be for the greater good for you, your family, your customers and your country.""

It's worth saying that the country and people thereof during 2002 (and subsequent smaller local brigade strikes) was never 'not protected'. Although the quality of that protection was not what it is used to.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"This transfer window is insane.  Clubs like Monaco spending retarded amounts of money on players like Hulk (I mean come on, he's not a 52mil player by any stretch) and offering crazy wages is going to impact the market.  Clubs are going to think they can demand more than their players are probably worth  so there's going to be a lot of inflated prices, crazy wage negotiations, and general money drama.  Hopefully we will avoid as much of this as possible and not fall into the trap of grossly overpaying for players again.  I think we'll be ok, the new owners and transfer committee seem to really have their shit together and they've done great business so far in the past 2 transfer windows.

BR said recently he's looking at a couple of players to directly improve the first team.  I doubt that a condition for these transfers will be Suarez leaving, although if he leaves I think we'll see different players targeted as it alters our immediate needs substantially.  I'm also sure that we're ready in the event an offer that we deem to be good enough comes in and we'll be able to move pretty quickly to pick up a replacement + a few other improvements.  We learned a hard lesson when Torres caught us with our pants down and i'd be surprised if we let it happen again.

I'm becoming more and more convinced that Suarez isn't leaving this summer.  I have serious doubts that we'd be willing to let him go to another EPL club unless the fee was astronomical (of which only City or Chelsea could afford but it's clear Chelsea is after Rooney and City just scooped up Negredo and Jovetic.. Arsenal won't pony up the cash to meet our valuation of him and we're clearly not going to accept less than that so far) and interest from Real has cooled right off in recent weeks (oh, and also because Zlatan).

I think LFC likes to do it's business quietly and we're doing a really good job of that so far aside from the Micky thing.  The Mkhitaryan craziness was really something else and I can't help but feel like the club want to avoid that kind of media fiasco when approaching clubs to buy players.

We've done an outstanding job of finding good young talent with lots of potential and we seem to have a great structure in place to nurture that talent.  Our long term plan is developing nicely and that's really exciting.  But I think the owners, management, players, and fans all want a little bit of immediate success too.  There's some obvious pressure to achieve that and missing out on the Champion's League for another 2-3 years isn't really going to do.  Could we accept that if we *have* to?  Sure, but we definitely all want much more than that.  

I think we're going to make some moves to really give us a great chance of getting there.  Keeping Suarez this season in addition to bringing 1-2 more top quality players to improve the first team (IMO a defender and an attacker are the biggest priorities assuming Suarez is still wearing red) will give us a really strong chance at breaking into the top 4 this season. We're probably a little bit behind Spurs and Arsenal as it stands now, but we're able to make that ground up with some astute signings and mount a serious assault on 4th place.  Obviously the sooner we get the rest of our targets in, the better, but we won't mind having to wait a little bit to get the right deals for the right players in place.

Love the monevator site in general. The broker section is also worth studying when you do decide what you want to do. Passive investing is a safe way to build a diverse cheap portfolio that won't require much work to set up or maintain. Its a great way to invest for a year or two to get a core portfolio and learn about some other trading methods that might interest you

Otherwise most people start with an asset allocation. how much do you have, how much do you earn, do you think you like risk, how would you handle a 25% drop in the value of your portfolio, how would you handle a 25% drop in the value of your portfolio and age tend to factor in.

Cash is basically the safest asset class. It will only decline with inflation.

Bonds come in a variety of packages, with varieties of risk. A uk goverment bond is much safer than a corporate bond as the uk is less likely to default on its debt than say argos

Shares can be the most risky but can be very rewarding

For beginners I definitely recommend against buying individual instruments. You need a good diverse core portfolio so you don't want to start buy buying a handful of different bonds and stocks. You want funds, ETFs or index trackers. Funds are more likely to be actively managed (by a fund manager), this will cost in yearly charges. ETFs and indexes trackers take an index (collection of companies/instruments, like the ftse 100) and match it, either synthetically by paying whatever the index would or actually buy buying the constituents of the index to very match the indexes performance. The latter (physically replicated ETF) is preferred

You are unlikely to get a great return without risk but that does not mean that more risk means better returns

So a simple old school ""bulletproof"" portfolio might go something like this.

25% uk equity

25% uk bonds

25% gold

25% cash

Here is my own portfolio model. Its an ETF portfolio that I re-balance and sway when I fell like. I work for a financial organisation and I cant trade stocks without reporting to big brother so if I want to well gamble (that's what you do when you buy and sell shares [but less so when diversified!]) I play with my asset allocation.

The time scale for saving in a stocks and shares ISA is long-term i.e. 15-20 years. I'm planning on starting out small (50 a month to begin with), eventually investing the maximum allowed per year (career-development permitting).

This is my first time investing anything, and index-funds seems fairly low-risk (if the folks at r/financialindependence and r/personalfinance are to be believed). Although I know that any investment is a gamble at the end of the day.

My attitude to risk is that I don't fully understand the term. I understand that the investment can go up or down, and I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with is my hard-earned cash being lost completely. Maybe based on that someone could tell me whether that's high, medium or low?

I shall have a read at your link, thanks for that.

The retirement age used to be 55. They have since increased it against medical advice to 60. There used to be protection agreements by way of if you achieve 30 years service you can retire early. That is no longer an option, although there are 'protection' arrangements for those that have done X amount of years, who can leave when they hit 30 years.

The government is imposing fitness tests on firefighters, which is fair enough (from my perspective). Firefighters need to have a level of fitness to do the job. I need to know that my number 2 when fighting a compartment fire, or dragging a heavy set individual is not going to keel over when he's supposed to be covering my arse. I do not know if you are familiar with VO2 Max, but if you are, the decision is that a minimum of 42 is required on that scale to do the hardest job, which is apparently wear breathing apparatus and fight a compartment fire.

Now, that is not really a problem if you happen to be 20-30. Hell if you are 30-50 you should be able to achieve it with regular training, which is part of the job. Then it starts getting iffy though. With age, fitness declines. You fail the test, you get sacked. You lose your job and have no pension to fall back on until you hit state pension age. No job, no pension. But that's okay, because they are throwing jobs around these days for 50 and 60 something people. Right?

This needless to say has even harsher results of firefighters who happen to be female. They have the same retirement age and are expected to meet the same fitness requirements, and without trying to sound sexist, men and women usually have different fitness levels.

FOI and DP Acts are the legal basis for obtaining the information but its not unreasonable to expect that the information be given to you by such as student services within 24 hours given you are considering making an appeal. Would not necessarily be any documentation on this.

Some universities only give 14 days for an appeal. This is one of the difficulties in making an appeal. There may well be irregularities but one can't make an appeal on the basis of them without first obtaining the information to know of them. Is that a catch 22 situation?

I think you'll have to enquire at student services.

You say that you only received the mark last week. I take it you received the feedback at the same time? It would perhaps be odd if not.

Why are you only getting marks so close to the assessment board? Marks are supposed to go through an internal moderation process. Do you know of any students who haven't received feedback?

From all that you say you may well have good reason to be annoyed but whether that can be translated into anything useful is a different matter.

How does the grade marking work? If an A represents 70+ then a D puts your module mark in the 40-49 band?

As a potential first class graduate you must have some insight into whether or not a D is fair for what you handed in? What was your previously lowest mark?

I've read all the replies here and they all come down to the same thing (which is what I think too) - you need to somehow prove there was misconduct or irresponsibility somehow.

If I read correctly, your marks got assessed by a board (which I at York would have called the Board of Studies). They are an edge case committee which takes decisions on the final grade. For obvious reasons, people whose marks get put before that committee are often not allowed to appeal because of the very nature of edge cases - there's a potential to go either way and everyone would appeal.

The way it worked at my university was that you could appeal almost anything, but you'd never get your own results changed. The only possible outcome (unless there was gross negligence or evidence of corruption) was that they'd ensure that the same doesn't happen to other people next year.

That said, the fact that George Osbourne is pumping £130 billion into the sub-prime mortgage market suggests that property prices will indeed rise over the next few years.  However, as anyone with half a brain who can remember back 5 years will know that this is an absolutely disastrous strategy in the long run.  It absolutely beggars belief that he's deliberately doing the very thing that brought the world economy to its knees and triggered the recession that we're currently in.  

This futile attempt to keep the housing bubble inflated is only going to make the crash harder when it finally comes.  But he doesn't seem to care, presumably because he knows he'll be out of office by then.  I'm sure that £130 billion of tax payer's money that he's handing over to the banks will buy him positions on the board (or lucrative ""consultancy roles"") at numerous major financial institutions.

There's the real rub - if you're going to threaten something, you have to be prepared to back it up. Allowing people to potentially burn in order to protect your pension is not, IMHO, what most would consider an option/ position in the first place.

&gt;I would love to hear it and I'm sure the FBU would too.

Running out of options doesn't automatically put previously-considered-as-immoral options on the table instead, then *or* now. 
But off the top of my head - why not leave the hoses running 'by accident'? Who, after all, picks up the water bill? It's not as if they can then dock your wages for it. :-)

&gt;It's a shame she decided to go for a 'gotcha' question, rather than delving into the deeper issues

The issue she (and I, to be honest) can't get past is the blatant moral gymnastics going on, not how badly you've been treated as an employee. In short, she won't strike regardless of what the Gov. does to her job because she doesn't believe in taking it out on her patients who have nothing to do with the situation when their health is at stake. Is the Government aware of this? Sure, if anything they rely on it. Does that mean it's acceptable for any of the three essential services to take action against the public when there's a spat with the Government? I'd suggest not. Nobody is going to be interested in the 'deeper issues' if a child dies because someone decided to stop acknowledging what a government job means.

&gt;I would not like it at all ma'am.

This reminds me of the Prime Minister series in the 70's where the union guy says to the PM something like ""right, from now on there will be no blood or organ deliveries, no meals on wheels and no fuel deliveries for the elderly until you learn some compassion!"". Do you really, seriously think that if someone burns to death because you don't like your pension that the public on your side will still be there? You don't seem to realise the damage the *last* strike did, better resulting services or no.

&gt;Although the quality of that protection was not what it is used to.

Pretty much the pattern historically. Water seems OK, energy is more expensive and unpopular but the actual evidence is mixed (it was always going to increase in price with falling North Sea yields, and actually fell in the immediate post-privitisation period) and the railways was done badly.

We haven't done our tapping up business in the press, so we shouldn't have antagonised Lerner. 

Benteke has hit the ground running the last two seasons, scoring 19 in 37 in his first season at Genk. He then obviously adapted quickly to England, a promising sign that he is tactically astute enough to flourish quickly in new environments.

People looking to trade upwards is now an unavoidable part of the game. He is looking to play at a high level before a world cup year. If he impresses again, it is more than likely going to be tied to Spurs being in a better place where we are now. If he demands a transfer we will be looking at a big windfall plus the ability to be attractive to other quality players. Saying that though, Spurs are pretty close to the summit in the natural order of things, and we have proven we can resist the call of the big boys to an extent.

I think Benteke would be a great signing for us, and having him as the  leading attacker brings strength, pace, guile and goals. There was a statistic posted here the other day where Benteke's aerial duels won per game is like 7.9 while the next closest in the list was under 2.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I am going to start by saying I am not in on the Benteke hype wagon at all. 

&gt;Do you think he's worth the reported 25m+ that Villa are demanding?
What price do you think is fair?

No way. A fair price for him is probably around £20m, that isn't due to ability at all, but rather because he has ages left on his contract which give Villa a heap of bargaining room. Based on ability alone I would put him at £17m. A year ago this guy was worth £7m, there is no way that he has added £18m of value in one season alone. That puts him into the price range of Higuain, Jovetic, Soldado, Dzeko etc. Those are guys who have done what Benteke has for multiple seasons in a row and have proven they are more than a flash in the pan. With only one good season (in a decent league) under his belt it is an insult to those other players to suggest Benteke is as valuable.

&gt;Do you think he can provide the 20 or so goals we need from our number 1 striker?

No. Many strikers have had one good season and then failed to back it up. Cisse and Carroll come to mind in recent years. Is anyone really expecting Michu to rack up the goal tally he did last season? In fact, he is a perfect comparison point. Michu scored one less goal than Benteke last season but since the media aren't on his dick spurs fans couldn't give a shit about him.

That came across as offensive, but it's tough to reword. Michu and Benteke did very similar things last season, hell, Michu led Swansea to silverware. I don't see what separates Benteke from Michu and I doubt many of you would argue Michu is about to knock in 20+ goals.

Benteke had a golden season, with a team built around him. He hasn't shown consistency (across seasons), nor that he can play second fiddle (which he would have to with Bale in the side) which to me implies that he would struggle to hit last seasons heights (let alone better them).

At the £25m price tag, you could buy 2 or 3 Kiesslings, who has 20+ in the Bundesliga year after year. Or Soldado, who has done similar in Spain. I know the obvious argument is that Benteke is young so has more room to grow. But what are we hoping he grows into, Kiessling or Soldado? Why not save ourselves the time (and some money) and buy the end product. 

Of course, there is value to be recouped with Benteke. You could sell him down the line for a profit. Well, not if rumours are to be believed. &lt; £20m down payment and then a 25% sell on fee will cripple any profits you want to make on the player. Not to mention he has handed in two transfer requests in two years, not sure what the definition of a merc is but that has to come close. 

&gt;What do you think the strengths/weaknesses of his game are, and how do you think they would effect his ability to settle into the squad?

He is a physical beast which allows him to impose himself in the air and on the ball. On top of that he has relatively good decision making skills, he picks the perfect times to shoot as reflected by his conversion %. I would say he is poor at holding up the ball, you could hit the ball forward to someone like Adebayor and know that he will hold it up well and get involved in the general build up of play. Benteke doesn't offer that, which to me is concerning because with Bale on the field you want to be able to involve him as much as possible. Jovetic, Kiessling and Soldado are all great at doing that, Benteke not so much.

&gt;Finally, does his apparent willingness to request a transfer to a better club worry you?

Yes it does. Suarez forced his way out of Ajax to get to Liverpool (and was serving a suspension for biting). He has a break out season at Liverpool and look what is happening now. I don't think Benteke grew up loving spurs, if he signs next year and knocks in 20+ goals like everyone hopes I would say there is quite a chance that he tries jump ship (especially if CL football isn't acquired).

Bert Trautmann broke his neck in a challenge with peter murphy during the FA cup final, not only did he stand up without on his own, but he finished the game, not only did he finish the game, but he went on to make multiple critical saves in order to give the blues an FA Title. It is no secret, that the beautiful game has been plagued with divers and actors. the one element of football that kept me away from supporting it for so many years, is that the players would often act as if they were injured in order to get the other players carded for any tackles. I hate to call a specific name, but I have particularly realized Sergio Busquets to be a serious actor. It upsets me every time I see him go to ground and scream like a child who fell off his bike. I think he could learn something from Bert Trautmann, he played with a potentially fatal injury, and showed a form of true grit that the world had never seen before. To players like Busquets, stop ruining the beautiful game and play with the soul like some of the historical footballers.
your service for the blues will never be forgotten Trautmann, now this legend is under god’s wing and can enjoy paradise for eternity

And as for consistency, I don't think you can entirely disregard his great year with Genk, considering he essentially replicated it in the PL.

Your point of being the focus of the team is a good one of course, but considering he and Bale would really be the primary goal scorers, I don't think it'd be much of an issue.  It's not like hes being asked to do nothing but feed other players.  Also, Bale and Benteke are different types of goal scorers.  I don't know how much Bale's scoring exploits would take away from Benteke.  How many of Bale's goals were scored on counters, or were closing minutes shots from outside the box?

You should definitely definitely look into regular investments. That will keep your costs right down. Here is the spiel from III's [portfolio builder \(regular investment\)](http://www.iii.co.uk/shares/portfolio-builder) to tell you more about it.  The regular investing column [here](http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/). Shows which brokers do it.
FYI I really like Iweb as a discount broker. £5 a trade and £2 regular investing. TD Direct is fairly highly regarded now but has been crap in the past. I use III and HL but want to go with IWeb soon

Costs and charges can be a whole nother thing that can save a % or 3 a year (which is significant when it comes to a portfolio performance).

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; 1) There is a massive housing shortage in the UK. 

The UK doesn't have a housing shortage. The UK has an *affordable* and accessible housing shortage. According to [this report](http://www.emptyhomes.com/statistics-2/empty-homes-statistice-201112/) (possibly biased) something like 3% of houses in England are empty, and a third of those for more than 6 months. For various reasons the people who need houses aren't able to use these ones (and this doesn't include the tens of thousands of uninhabitable houses - which could be used if there was sufficient investment, or the hundreds of thousands of empty flats noted in that report).

Obviously there are many factors which cause this; wealth inequality may be a big one (leading to people with multiple houses, new luxury houses being built instead of cheaper ones, no money in solving this problem etc.). Another problem seems to be Governments (local and national) looking for short-term and/or privatised solutions, rather than long-term ones (for example, [spending £2bn a year](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/05/19/uk-housing-crisis-costing-taxpayer-2bn/) housing people in short-term, emergency accommodation (B&amp;Bs etc.) rather than investing in getting them long-term real housing).

Taking away more money from those without much is unlikely to help with any of this, but that's conservative policies for you.

------------------

*Edit* - Belated further thought:

If a bedroom tax is a sensible thing to impose in the circumstances (to try to tackle empty bedrooms), surely the solution would be to *actually introduce a bedroom tax* (or equivalent measure).

The current policy isn't a bedroom tax; it is a (fairly arbitrary) benefit cut. An actual tax on empty or under-occupied homes might help the situation, raise some revenue (rather than cutting expenditure), encourage people with second or third homes to sell space off etc..

But, of course, the people most hit by that would be those with large, multi-bedroom homes that aren't being used, or multiple houses; the upper-class/super-rich, MPs (with their second homes), and richer pensioners (who tend to have under-occupied homes) - three groups the Government is never going to annoy.",0,1374249919,null,0,1374257179,0,cb60my2,t3_1imcq1,t1_cb60my2,t1_cb5vwxf,null,1430409844,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Cisse had only half a season that he lit the PL on fire (while Newcastle were actually doing well) and then a full disappointing season (while Newcastle were shit and he was apparently played out of position).  I don't think a successful half season justifies too much hype, and I don't think it is his fault his second season wasn't as good.

Benteke went to Villa on deadline day, so no preseason (everyone in this sub is obsessed with how important a full preseason is, but he didn't need one) and a few games missed.  He scored 19 goals in 34 appearances with a shitty team.  He deserves the hype a little more than your examples.

You can't have *two* number-one priorities.

Patients always come first. So no matter what happens, she won't strike.

As a fireman you would probably say that your number one priority should be helping people who call the fire brigade. By striking, and therefore rendering yourself unable to help these people, you are bumping this priority down to at least the number two spot.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt; I think this article is a bit silly because I hate to say it, Man Utd aren't out rivals.

Well, I think that was the whole point of the column. It's about how Liverpool set the bar so high on success and how - in a disappointing reversal of roles - Manchester United is now the bar. We may not be direct rivals in the short-term, but we certainly are in the long run.

Furthermore, the column is also suggesting that comparison between Manchester United and Liverpool is still relevant:

&gt;And a look of the two clubs' record in the transfer market over the Premier League era indicates why United's superiority is now entrenched.

&gt;As neither has really received a huge artificial injection of money, which has transformed first Chelsea and then Manchester City, or gone into financial meltdown, like Leeds - even if Liverpool might have done had Tom Hicks and George Gillett stayed in charge - they remain the most relevant reference points for each other. Arsenal may be the closest comparison, but they pursued a particular business model under the economist Arsene Wenger. So, once again, it is United against Liverpool and while the Old Trafford faithful enjoy the scoreline Giggs 13 Gerrard 0 - the number of league titles the respective icons have won - the dealings provide some indication why.

And the column wasn't necessarily speaking about this particular window. It was more of an overview, a big picture view of these two clubs.

As for this window/season? I totally agree with you. I think we've made some smart moves in spite of the challenges that we face in this window (i.e. lack of Champions League, etc.). And I think we still have a few more moves to go to improve this squad and we'll see where the dust settles.

Additionally though I would question if there's any real benefit in moving someone from a 2bed to a 1bed flat. There has to be a point at which the move is deemed as not economically sensible, especially given the impact.

For example if you had an elderly couple in a 2 bed flat and one passed away, then it makes no sense to move the other to a 1 bed flat. The cost of doing so would be high, there's a high propensity for the other person to start to need more care, and may need sheltered housing or a care home, and ultimately the saving must be far outweighed by the cost of doing so. My understanding is elderly people aren't covered by the bedroom 'tax' anyway, but the point is sound.

Sure assign someone a 1 bed flat if that's what they need, but be rational about downsizing them afterwards and by all means only when a properly suitable property comes.

What I would say to temper that slightly is that social housing is not there to be the equal of the private sector. It isn't there to provide people a beautiful flat in a desirable part of town right where they grew up. But it is there to give someone a decent, clean property in a good state of repair that allows them to have a decent quality of life.

I understand that the housing bill can and should come down - but the response to Labour's years of shoving money at the poor to be quiet isn't to crank things entirely back to the right point immediately. Labour's lack of action means it should be a slow, measured process which eventually results in a stable status quo which is fair, and sustainable.",0,1374252206,null,0,false,0,cb61iyl,t3_1imcq1,t1_cb61iyl,t1_cb5xh0m,null,1430409426,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

As far as the RM reject thing goes, I think it's more nuanced than that. At RM, the primary goal threat was Ronaldo. This was obvious and international. As a result, they wanted a striker who could offer a lot besides goalscoring, one who would help Ronaldo score as often as he scored himself. That striker is Benzema. 

We aren't like that though. Our midfielders can all knock in a few, but really we have a wealth of creators. What we need up front is a clinical finisher who will bury the chances that are inevitably created for him. That's Higuain. Even as a second choice he has been able to keep his goal production high, higher than Benzema's in fact.

The lack of that killer finishing is what makes Torres practically useless to us. Many have (correctly) observed that other aspects of his game have improved now that his finishing has deserted us, and these days he's a decent player. However, he isn't the ruthless goal getter that we need. I would argue that Higuain is.

&gt;Hi! I'm from the American South, and I hear you lot are having a miserably hot time of it. I'm sure you've been inundated with various ways to keep cool, but just in case you've missed them, or haven't heard of a few, I figured it might be helpful to post some of the ways we keep cool when it's miserable out. Sorry if some of them are blindingly obvious.
&gt;
&gt;First! Keep your windows closed during the day, and open at night. I'm assuming that a fair number of you live in ~~castles~~ sturdy old buildings with a lot of mass, and if you can cool the place off at night, it'll hold in that chill for most of the day. Once the chill has totally worn off, consider opening windows to create a cross-breeze in the areas between them. You won't necessarily be *comfortable*, but you're less likely to sweat to death. Do you have a basement? Stay there. Hot air rises, so abandon what I think you call the first floor and everywhere above, to the sunwolves.
&gt;
&gt;Turn off any unnecessary electronics. They generate a lot of heat, and every little bit helps.
&gt;
&gt;Get heavy curtains and try to block off windows, especially ones that get direct sunlight on them. Also block off rooms you don't use much- leave them to be scorched to death like something out of that movie *Sunshine*. You should be focusing on keeping a few rooms habitable, not your whole place (I say this with American-sized houses in mind, but I think I read that people elsewhere live in much smaller places, so, adapt to your needs).
&gt;
&gt;For goodness sake don't use the oven or stove unless you just *cannot live* without a cup of tea. Eat cool things- fruit, gazpacho, iced tea (there's a reason it's big in the south here), etc. Also eat spicy things- the sweat will help you keep cool. Drink water all day long- you're sweating a fair amount, and you want to keep hydrated (if you're drinking massive quantities of water, mix a little bit of salt and a little bit of sugar into the water, to keep your electrolytes up).
&gt;
&gt;Don't do stuff in the heat of the day- usually in midafternoon. Seriously, just don't. It's too hot for that. Keep yourself cool by wrapping cool, damp cloths around your head and neck.
&gt;
&gt;If it's just too hot, try going places that are either huge and made of stone, like cathedrals or something, or more likely to be climate controlled, like libraries. Expect crowding in those places.
&gt;
&gt;Do you have ceiling fans in your home? Most of them here have a switch on the side that will change the direction of the fan's spinning. You want the fan spinning in such a way that it's forcing air down (it's usually counterclockwise here, but I don't know if that's a manufacturing standard there, so experiment).
&gt;
&gt;If you've got a window AC unit, or anything like that, you're in business- keep the room that the unit is in cool, and the rest of the house can go to hell. If you don't have one, the next paragraph is awesome.
&gt;
&gt;Remember how I said you want to just focus on keeping a few rooms habitable? Here's the trick on how to do it. First, get all the containers you can possibly find, fill them up with water, and stick them in your freezer. Yes, all of them. Trust me. Put some salt in the water if you want to, so it'll freeze colder. While those are freezing, gather up all the fans you can scrounge- box fans are best, but they're probably in short supply over there by now, so do your best. Also, get a drink cooler type of deal.
&gt;
&gt;Once you have a freezer full of ice, fans, and a cooler, you are ready to construct a swamp cooler. It probably won't work as well as it would if you were in Arizona or something, because it is best when humidity is low, and a friend in NI says it is humid as all get out. Regardless, it will still work adequately. Your swamp cooler, at its simplest, is constructed by setting up a fan so that it is blowing across a cooler full of ice. Thanks to the magic of heat transfer and evaporation, you will get a lovely cool breeze. You can go super fancy if you want, and [build one like this](http://www.fiscalgeek.com/2009/07/homemade-air-conditione/), or you can stick with just the simpler version. If you can't get ice, even just a wet t-shirt draped over a box fan will cool things off somewhat, so do what you can.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I hope that helps a little, maybe. If you have other tricks, please share them!

Edit: I have a spare box fan that I haven't used since 2010. If someone wants to pay for shipping (from Florida to the UK o.O ) they are welcome to the fan for free. Message me if you want it. First come, first serve, get your own transformer because we run on 120V here.

Second edit, and this is unbelievably, life-and-death important. For real. **DO NOT LEAVE CHILDREN OR PETS IN TURNED OFF CARS.** They will die. I'm not even joking. I know you guys don't depend on cars as much as we do here so this may not apply to you, but still, the temperature inside a car sitting in the sun can [get really hot](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/hot-cars-perilous-for-children/32249).
&gt;The study found that even at 9 a.m. with an outside temperature of 28 degrees, the closed automobile registered 43 degrees inside. When the outside temperature rose to 44 degrees at 1:30 p.m., the closed vehicle reached 51 degrees. [I thoughtfully converted from Fahrenheit to Celcius for you there]

I am sure that answers his question satisfactorily. 

I think his point was that his Nurse wife would never strike, because she has different priorities than you. But there we are.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/9943167/Budget-2013-Millions-get-help-to-buy-new-homes-says-George-Osborne.html

http://www.mortgageintroducer.com/mortgages/245980/5/Industry_in_depth/Budget_2013:_Osborne_unveils_Help_to_Buy_initiative.htm

The problem as I see it is that the housing ladder is getting stretched.  At the top of the ladder there's a lot of foreign investment, particularly in London, that's driving up prices at the top end of the market.  That in turn is pulling up prices of cheaper properties in London and surrounding areas.  But there comes at point towards the bottom of the housing market where the cheapest properties are now too expensive for first time buyers.  Even at the historically low interest rates, average people can't afford mortgages to buy such properties.  And without new ~~suckers~~ people joining the bottom of the property ladder, there's no chance for other people to climb up it.  So Osbourne is guaranteeing their loans so that these people who *shouldn't* be eligible for mortgages can now get them.

In simple terms, he's funding sub-prime mortgages with public money.

As soon as the interest rate rises, many people will find they can no longer pay their mortgage.  Houses will be repossessed, prices will drop sharply and another generation will find themselves caught in the negative equity trap.  In fact this is already happening, but Osbourne has persuaded the banks to switch people to interest only mortgages instead of foreclosing on them.  

The spectator has a good commentary on the situation at http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8915781/osbornes-bubble/ 

&gt; James Ferguson of MacroStrategy Partners calculates that in the first part of the crisis alone some 700,000 people were moved from repayment mortgages to interest-only mortgages. This is strange, given that interest-only mortgages were being pulled from the wider market. The Financial Services Authority also estimates that around 8 per cent of households were some kind of forbearance. In a normal world all these people would have been defaulters.

That 700,000 represents around 3% of households (and that's in the first part of the crisis alone) and it's approximately equal to the number of houses on the market at the moment (source: http://www.home.co.uk/company/stats.htm).  So it's possible that if Osbourne hadn't interfered then there could have been twice as many houses on the market which would have driven prices down significantly.

But of course, that's the last thing he wants to do.   

Now we'll just have to wait out a few years and watch the bubble burst.  I just hope it doesn't take the whole country's economy with it.",0,1374255270,null,0,false,0,cb62rrl,t3_1impz4,t1_cb62rrl,t1_cb61xj4,null,1430408838,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Have a read [here](http://www.fbu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/9560-Pensions-LEAFLET-A5-X-4pp-NEW-27_6_13-LOW-RES.pdf) to see if military pension cuts are comparible to the Fireservice Pension Scheme changes.

&gt;We do not accept a normal pension age (NPA) of 60 for
firefighters. We have fought a principled, evidence-based campaign against its introduction. However, the Public Service Pensions Act is now in place. That does not mean that we will drop our opposition to the Act or accept that it is appropriate or safe to require our members to work to age 60. We will continue to campaign for the repeal of the Act as we are entitled to do and we will continue to make the case for a lower NPA as in the existing Firefighters Pension Schemes.

&gt;We all know that firefighting is a physically demanding occupation and that for large numbers of firefighters maintaining occupationalfitness to the new NPA of 60 is an unrealistic expectation. Everybody knows that fitness declines with age. Their own review shows that at least 66% of current firefighters will not be able to maintain their fitness until age 60. It outlines two options for these firefighters:

&gt;• Leave the service without a pension

&gt;• Capability dismissal from the service – without a pension.

&gt;In other words many of us will face the sack – for the crime of getting older. Members who have paid into a pension scheme for many years will face the prospect of no job and no pension.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt;  I was mind blown how much cheaper paying a mortgage is than renting.

But not when the interest rate is 14%

I'm in my mid-40s and got my first mortgage in the late 80s.  I can remember it going up from around 8% to 14% over the course of a few months.  However, back then a typical variable rate mortgage was base rate + 1% (our current variable rate ""tracker"" mortgage is base rate + 0.7%).  

Now that the base rate is so low, banks are offering mortgages that are base rate + 4% or more ([examples](http://www.mortgagerates.org.uk/mortgages/variable-rate.html)).  So when the base rate rises to 10% (more than likely over the course of a 30 year mortgage), you may actually be paying 14% or 15%.  If the base rate gets to 14% again then you could be paying closer to 20%.

My advice would be to pay off as much of your mortgage as you can while the interest rates are low.  If you think your mortgage is currently cheap compared to what you were paying in rent then you might want to think about artificially raising your mortgage payments to what you were paying in rent.  e.g. if you were paying £1500 in rent and now pay £1000 in mortgage, then assume your mortgage is actually £1500 and budget for that every month.  If you can pay off additional money on your mortgage without penalty then do that (ours allows us to pay off up to 10% of the outstanding value in any year).  

TL;DR: mortgages are dirt cheap right now, but that's the exception, not the rule. ",0,1374257495,null,0,false,0,cb63npz,t3_1impz4,t1_cb63npz,t1_cb60pet,null,1430408420,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Those two facts remain true from that article, as do a lot of the other numbers, and those were the most important ones.

Revenue as a whole is a very different story, so I see what you're getting at that tying us into pre-CL commercial deals could hurt us if we get back in the CL and thus could get better deals, but that whole issue is moot regarding the shirt deal, as it is already fantastic and much better than Liverpool deserves based on on-pitch performances.

true,westyfield,eng-wessex,Bath/Southampton,"For best results you should use a tea pot with loose-leaf tea. Assam or Ceylon are my personal recommendations but you might find it easier to get English Breakfast Tea (a blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenya).

**Instructions for making tea with a teapot (the proper way):**

* Boil water. I gather kettles aren't common in America so you may have to use a saucepan on the hob.
* Rinse out teapot with hot water. This will help your tea stay hot longer, and gives a better brew.
* Add tea leaves to empty (but warm) pot. One teaspoon of tea per cup, plus one 'for the pot'.
* Pour boiling water onto leaves. If you do have a kettle you'll have to boil some fresh water - it is essential that the water be boiling *when* it hits the leaves. This is why using a coffee machine to brew tea is wrong.
* Leave to brew for 3-5 minutes.
* Add milk to cup (if desired). You may have to experiment a bit in order to discover how much milk you like, but a milk-to-tea ratio around 1:6 is a good starting point. Much has been said of whether the milk should be added to the tea or the tea should be added to the milk, but anyone who argues the former is silly. *Edit: To clarify, milk should be in the cup before you pour the tea in. It's harder to judge the milkiness this way, but avoids the danger of scalding the milk.*
* Pour tea from pot through tea strainer [(a little sieve that catches the leaves so you don't drink them)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_strainer) into your cup. If you wish to add sugar - which you shouldn't - do so here.

Alternatively, you can use teabags. These are quicker, but they taste worse and are not really on.

**Instructions for making tea with teabags (don't do this):**

* Put teabag in mug.
* Boil water.
* Pour boiling water over teabag.
* Leave to brew for 3-5 minutes.
* Remove teabag.
* Add milk (and, heaven forbid, sugar).

Now then, you'll probably have noticed that I was fairly strict on certain matters (the order of milk addition; and the grievous sin of adding sugar, for example). That is common to all British discourse on tea-making. Everyone has their personal recommendations for how to make the best tea, and there are many minor alterations that can be made to the process. I am right though, and anyone who disagrees with me is wrong and possibly foreign.

If you have any questions or want brand recommendations, feel free to ask.  
I hope this helps, and enjoy your tea!

Fair enough, until the revolution comes, I don't think the poor should all be living in Kensington mansions. It's not necessary. I think the problem is when people even have adequate dwellings but they have to live with the perpetual uncertainty of whether or not they can afford it and whether they can be settled. 

Quibbling over the number of rooms as they're doing now, is just shitty. The government is just being shitty for shitty's sake. 

Labour's money shoving is something we both dislike for different reasons, I would guess. For me, they strengthened the grip of the capitalists and stifled protest and dissent by keeping the poor quiet.
