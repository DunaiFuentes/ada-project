true,c0ldworld,null,null,"Hello everyone, born in Canterbury, raised in Chartham, moved to Canterbury for a while , currently living nr. Dover. Dad used to live in Maidstone for a while so I saw a lot of that place too. People talking about the North Kent/South Kent divide and the comments regarding West Kent and Thanet are pretty much spot on. As for the rest I have never heard so much guff in my entire life especially coming from people who only came here for university. 

Let me point out I'm not particularly offended just worried because you clearly don't know what your talking about Rassimoflom

Let's address some individual points first :

There are loads of restaurants in Canterbury, in fact the majority of restaurants are not chains, there are a tonne of chinese , indian and thai places, mexican restaurants , lebanese and Moroccan cuisine. Trad british places ( Deeson's...wow) and plenty of ""fusion"" cuisine to boot. We also are home to more pubs per capita than anywhere else in the U.K so there are plenty of pleasant pub lunches to be had. Coffee is supplied by probably the best coffee place south of London Brown's Coffee house. The guys there have just featured in a trade magazine and do amazing taster sessions etc. Really know their stuff. The nightlife can be rather slow mid week but it sounds like your not particularly concerned by that.



As for problems with heroin, i presume RassimoFlom must have not visited Canterbury for about 10-15 years? I grew up here and while it's not exactly hard to find drugs  ( consider the 4 universities and Canterbury college for a moment.) It's hardly like people are strung out in parks, there are quite a lot of homeless people but this is largely because a lot of the charities around east kent are based in the City, this combined with the large amounts of tourists is an obvious draw. Just walk past them, they are not really an issue and the streets are safe at night. Both my parents have been head teachers in South East kent and the behaviour question completely depends on what school you end up in, it is by no means a universal fact of Secondary education. Whitstable feeds into Canterbury schools  usually and broadstairs into Danecourt so those are things to consider.  The city is well served by supermarkets for any price range and taste so ignore the pricey farmers market. 


Dover is home to 2 very good schools and while the town is somewhat dull there has been a lot of redevelopment recently, large amounts of what was previously abandoned light manufacturing  has been converted and in general the town is much more pleasant. I used to come here to visit a girlfriend about 5 years ago, and the difference now is staggering. Probably one of the best pub/bars in Kent is here nestled in the old wharves. 

If you have any questions you actually want answered by someone who lives here and can help you especially re:education questions please fire away.

McManaman would be a younger option than Downing and wouldn't have to play right away. I think he could be molded into the system well. Might not be a long term solution since Sterling and Ibe are likely more talented and also both right footed wingers.
At 22, he could bridge that gap between Downing, who is on too high of wages, and Sterling, who is still a bit raw.

Let's look at the terms of your deal, the £250,000 you were paid upfront was an advance to cover costs during production and as with most record deals you're required to cover x units or you have to repay a percentage of the money. You accept that maybe if the music is bad and the album doesn't get good reviews and people don't like it that you'll not get the sales you need and you'll need to repay the advance but you're confident that this won't happen because you know deep down you're an incredible musician.

The day of the release comes, the reviews start to come out and your Twitter feed blows up! People love the album! You phone your manager to see how things are going, ""bad news I'm afraid, people love it but they're not buying it :( You've got 200,000 people downloading via thepiratebay but only 5000 have purchased it, it looks like you're not going to meet the targets to keep your advance"".

You think, ""well I guess as long as people like my music it's okay because sure I'll go broke and lose everything after this but at least it's not because someone else is profiting from my music"" so you phone your friend Barry, he is really upset for your predicament 'cause he's a good friend (and loves your music) but he has some unfortunate news, ""you know your album is big on *those pirate sites*"", ""yeah?"" you say, ""well those websites are for-profit enterprises, they run advertisements against the pages that show the download options and some of them make millions of dollars per year!"", ""so they're making money from my music and I don't see a penny of it?"", ""yep!"", "":("", ""BUT AT LEAST THEY LIKE YOUR MUSIC LOL"". Barry would get a punch in the damn face.

That's the sort of bullshit I don't like and I am fucking glad my tax money is going towards dealing with bullshit like that. ""Media fat cats""? Please, the people involved in the media industry are just like everyone else. Do you think that the janitor at EMI is making 8 figures, the PAs, the album art designers, the cooks? Yes, some people are making big money because they're at the top but by purposefully fucking them you're fucking everyone else involved.

If I ever release an album or a movie or something that people consume like those I want to know for damn sure that the government has laws in place to protect my personal investment in my media. 

I want a government that helps **everyone** regardless of their wealth or situation, everyone should be treated well.

PS: ""Outdated business models"" is such a fucking stupid buzz phrase, an outdated business model causes a business to die *because their product isn't meeting market demands*, if Rihanna wasn't meeting market demand she wouldn't have sold 100,000,000 copies of her music and she wouldn't have billions of people consuming her content, but because you don't want to pay for something suddenly she's not keeping up with the magical business model that she needs to use to keep you happy. What is that by the way, give her music away for free and live on benefits?

If bread is too expensive either you buy it elsewhere or you don't get bread at all. If the bread manufacturers want your business back they'll lower their prices (if possible) or die. If you just take that bread anyway regardless of the cost you get arrested for stealing. If music is too expensive either you buy it or you just steal it and call yourself a hero for sticking it to the big guys. If you want the media industry to change stop stealing their damn content. Music too expensive? Don't listen. 

pps: I downvoted you.

ppps: this bullshit of people saying independent artists hate the big labels and choose to have their music pirated is bullshit, there are quite a few independent artists and independent label owners that think piracy is fucking lame and should be stopped if possible (which it isn't but that isn't the point).

Le sigh.

The police can ask the networks to identify anyone using the phone in that specific location at that specific time. At best a handful of people would appear in the list. With beamforming on the cell site, the accuracy of isolating users within a block of a few tens of square metres is quite easy.

As to why they would do it - bloody obvious innit. She's a witness to a road accident. At the very least they will want to get a statement as to what happened.

Whether they decide to do anything else, no idea, that's up to the police/cps.

Goes on all the time. Every mobile network has a dedicated desk set up to handle police requests for location based data. It really is fairly routine and has been for some years.

Most companies would be around the 4% mark for their margins. I know that's what Walmart aims for. Walmart has more stores and employees though so I imagine Amazon probably manages more than 4%.. Then again they undercut everyone so maybe not. 

Anyway, if that's the case then that'd be about $260m of profits. If taxed at the 24% corporation tax that would mean $62.4m of tax income should be expected.

But you can't waste your final year at uni resenting it, because that's not going to help you. Like it or not you have to play the hand you've been dealt and the grown up thing to do is try your very hardest to get the best mark you can and research all your options from there. You've still got to finish your degree yet. Uni doesn't just give you an education. You'll have an alumni, you'll have a careers advisory service, your uni should give you support with job direction. Remember that despite what you may feel now, you have no idea how your life would have worked out if you hadn't gone to uni. A 2:2 isn't awful, it's just a bit meh - people with degrees still earn vastly more than their non educated counterparts by the time they get to their 30s and 40s. 

That being said, I've not heard of anyone getting into the creative industries because of their degree. It's kind of a no brainer. If you want to be creative then you just do it, uni is not a direct way into it. Uni is academic, pure and simple, and that's really all anyone should expect. I think a lot of people assume that having a degree in a relevant field to a career they want means it's straight progression into that career, and that's simply not how it is. There's no magic process to it, it all comes from within. 

I would advise you to focus on your degree for the academic merit, and for the industry experience, maybe start pimping yourself out for free at a media company.

true,thecritic06,,G and Tea,"A flash edugame about Shakespeare on the BBC website in about 2006. Set on a remote desolate Scottish island, the player character is a theatre critic invited to the unfinished, gothic horror private theatre built by the writer of a play called Seven Noble Kinsmen. The critic slated the play, which was an arrogant cannibalisation of Shakespeare's work, destroying the careers of every actor involved and causing it to close within a week. At the start of the game, the writer has invited all those actors, and the critic, to see the fruits of a decade-long rewrite. But one by one, the actors are murdered. Trapped on the island with the killer, you have to work out who they are solving the Shakespeare -based riddles and puzzles they leave to taunt you. Unfortunately you can't make accounts any more so it's unplayable.

We're all citizens of this country, we all need a roof over our heads. Yet the state allows those who are rich to monopolise the land, and deprive the poor of this essential. That's essentially what ""property"" is.

That would be fine, if wealth was distributed fairly or in reward for work  or enterprise. If you work hard or have a genius business idea, then you deserve nice things. 

But if wealth isn't just about that - over the last 2 or 3 decades we have rising wealth inequality and falling social mobility. That seems like a de facto aristocracy, as far as I can see.

Mine is not as bad as my brothers, but its bad enough.  Its not just limited to forming words and sentences, I actually don't have a huge problem with that, at least verbally.  I have trouble reading unfamiliar words and spelling unfamiliar words, I forget how to spell short words, I had serious issues as a kid reading rows and would mostly try to read at an angle otherwise I'd start skip down lines midway through at sentence.  When reading I will insert words that are not there and i've been known to change entire sentences around without realising - that goes double when doing speeches.  I have to proof read things at least 3 times to ensure I haven't put in the wrong words because its hard for me to spot mistakes. 

So yes I did accidentally use the American word because I have to stick everything through a spell check to make sure I haven't missed out words and my words are not mangled.  unfortunately my spell check was using American English.

a major point is that work with little assigned value is the only work that will ever conceivably become orphaned. the same way in which your father may pass on property with value to you when he passes away is what a prudent father would do with the copyright to work of significant or even insignificant value. in the case of business closure then while that business is being liquidated the copyrights that it owns will be valued and traded in a manner that suits.

copyright remains the same, the orphan bill will either strengthen the copyright holders position or make a reasonable defence out of the use of orphan work without permission because the copyright holder is unreachable; if that was the case then the law will surely make way for adequate reparation if the copyright holder does come forth because that is what is just and that is the intention behind laws.

Interesting idea about people investing in what you add to the group and how they protect it by giving resistance bringing up things like alcoholism as this does happen. I find it hard to believe that someone is constantly assessing who and what's going on while having an agenda for a long term plan. Such scheming would take so much effort to pull off unnoticed I would actually be impressed to find out I have been manipulated into being part of a strategy just a pawn on a chessboard.

It's up to the band to use that to finance recording and promoting their album, making a video, and hitting the road on tour - obviously the specifics vary but that's the gist. Bands make a tiny percentage of the cash from recordings, so it's quite possible to have a million dollar deal, sell two million albums, and still be in debt to your label. Most touring bands make cash from merchandising, because you might make six cents on a CD sale, but you can make twelve dollars on a Tshirt sold at a gig. 

As I say, this isn't a set formula, but it's mainly the record company that makes the cash. This is why manufactured pop bands work - you create them, but a million in paid media space, make ten million and give the band a small percentage. If it doesn't work, write them off against tax, and they can always make some cash doing shitty reality shows if needed.",0,1368645602,null,0,1368696589,0,c9zelmb,t3_1ednh9,t1_c9zelmb,t1_c9zd654,null,1431147157,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,PeterSutcliffe,,Pint of Vodka pls,"&gt;Most of all though, I think that the dogged insistence on using this word as a pejorative belies a chronic lack of literacy.

I'm fairly literate, more so than average and always have been. I was reading Dan Brown, Terry Pratchett, Stephen King and a few other ""adult authors"" when I was 10 years old. I've never had a problem with reading as long as it interests me.

&gt;Like, can't you think of any better way to criticise things you dislike?

Sure, tons of words. I don't use 'gay' in that sense of the word as much as I've grown up, but when I was younger we did a lot. 

What, do you expect 13 year olds to walk around talking like Stephen Fry? ""I say my boy, this arts class that we are railroaded into by the board of education really does not pique my interests, I do rather believe that this class is what Dante had in mind when he was writing his the novel of his namesake 'Dantes inferno'!""

&gt;Any way which doesn't make gay people around you feel like shit?

Already mentioned, the gay people I know are fine with it. Also funnily enough as a straight guy I'm not surrounded by gay men, weird that.

&gt;Is using 'gay' as 'bad' really worth all the issues it causes?

What issues? I've upset someone on the internet? Take a number and join the queue. If you don't like what you see, you can always press that little X in the top right.

I think I have some slightly unique opinions on companions:

One of my favorite companions is Zoe Heriot, who travelled with the second Doctor. She's both fun and serious, she's absolutely brilliant (often smarter than the Doctor), and she's an amazing combination of cute and sexy. Her (and Jamie's) eventual separation from the Doctor made me cry. (Even though it's from 1969, no spoilers) ;)

I also really like Ace, and her time with the seventh Doctor. I find her to be such a wonderfully complex character. She is so teachable and childlike and yet independent and bossy. Plus, she ran head-first at a group of Daleks wielding nothing but a baseball bat like a BOSS. I also just finished reading a Doctor Who novel with her in it, ""All-Consuming Fire"". :)

Lastly, I adore the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan. She plays the role of a ""slightly normal slightly alien school girl"" perfectly.

In the end the Doctor tricks Davros into blowing up Skaro's sun destroying the planet. This creates some problems since previous Doctor's had already visited Skaro at later points in it's timeline. In fact the 1st Doctor's first encounter with the Daleks is stated to have taken place towards the end of the Daleks' timeline (this is mentioned in the second Dalek story which takes place in 2164 on Earth in which Skaro is said to still be around). Also in the Doctor Who movie the 7th Doctor picks up the masters remains from Skaro.

This leads in to two theories I've heard
 
1) The Dalek's have time-travel technology, they simply either change time so Skaro wasn't destroyed or rebuilt it, this can also apply to the Time War assuming Skaro was destroyed (which I'm not sure is ever specifically said...just that ""every Dalek"" was wiped out...and we know THAT didn't happen.)

2) The Dalek's actually have had several homeworlds throughout their history which they conquered and re-named Skaro. The original Skaro was destroyed in Remembrance and the Dalek's found a new one, or the one that was destroyed was a new Skaro (which is more likely if you take the Thals, who were also residents of the original Skaro into account)",0,1368646113,null,0,false,0,c9zest3,t3_1edgyz,t1_c9zest3,t3_1edgyz,null,1431147063,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If a friend is being stingy, I don't tell them to 'stop being a jew'. I don't tell rape jokes because I don't know whether the people around me have suffered the experience of being raped. These choices spring from having basic empathy. To me, it isn't worth risking ruining someone's day to be able to use defamatory language. I know, too, that if I do upset someone, they might not always have the courage to confront me about it, and if I use certain words or expressions that people might not feel comfortable talking to me about related issues because they think I am a bigot.

""In 2010 Norway contributed € 230 million to the EU programme budget"" ([source](http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/UD/Vedlegg/eu/norge_og_eu_2011.pdf)).

UK contribution in 2010 appears to have been forecast at €7.2bn ([source](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8418275.stm)).

So with around 12 times Norway's population, we pay about 31 times what they pay in.

How UK ghost companies made Britain the capital of global corporate crime

A Special Report by RICHARD BROOKS and ANDREW BOUSFIELD 

SETTING OUT PLANS for the UK's presi-dency of the G8 at Davos in January, David Cameron presented ""a vision of proper com-panies, proper taxes, proper rules"". A light would be shone on corruption around the world with ""more transparency on how gov-ernments and, yes, companies operate"". Days later he was in Tripoli, lecturing Libyans on the need to ""uphold the law and fight corrup-tion"". But as a Private Eye investigation reveals, the world's most corrupt, least trans-parent companies are not located in fragile states or faraway tax havens. They are to be found here, in offices across the UK from Clapham to Cardiff, facilitating the most seri-ous international crimes while the government ignores one of Britain's few growth industries: corporate corruption services...

It doesn't take long on Europe's fastest motor-ways to get from the Munich offices of EADS, the European defence company, to the Austrian defence ministry in Vienna. But when in 2004 EADS employed a renowned Italian fraudster to facilitate side deals on the Austrian air force's €1.5bn purchase of a fleet of Eurofighter jets, the fixer set up in neither of these conveni-ent locations, nor at his longstanding base in Rome. Instead, he set up shop at 31 Dover Street in Mayfair.

From here and his Grosvenor Square apart-ment, Gianfranco Lande would manage an outfit that remained unknown until, four years later, suspicious Austrian MPs started to ask questions. By then Vector Aerospace Limited Liability Partnership, as the Mayfair firm was known, had paid out more than €80m to com-panies controlled offshore by Lande, his Maltese bagman David Marinelli, and other unknown parties. Much of the money was paid through RBS Bank in the Isle of Man; but where it ended up is still not clear. Among the outcomes believed to be linked to the scandal was the melting away of domestic opposition to the fighter contract in Austria: in 2004 the country had no discernible need for €1.5bn worth of fighter jets.

It wasn't just Vector's dubious payments that were impossible to trace: so too was the firm's ownership. Records pieced together by the Eye show two British companies, Hopewell Investments Ltd and Provan Trading Ltd, as ""members"", ie owners, of the ""limited liability partnership"". The control of these could be tracked back only as far as a chain of Belgian, British Virgin Islands and Maltese companies, behind which sat a mysterious Isle of Man trust. So even after Vector Aerospace LLP received an €18m pay-off when the whole set-up was dis-mantled following awkward questions in the Viennese parliament, where the cash went remained a mystery that is still furrowing the brows of Munich police officers who raided EADS-Deutschland over the matter last year.

The same could be said for the puzzling question of why a spider's web of companies channeling dubious payments on business entirely unrelated to the UK, for beneficiaries who had nothing to do with Britain, was spun from Mayfair. The answer lies in the historic relaxation of British company law, and almost non-existent regulation and financial policing, that has turned Britain into a capital of interna-tional organised crime.

""Limited liability partnerships"", of which Vector Aerospace LLP was one, joined the lexi-con of British corporate law only in 2000 as a result of heavy lobbying from Britain's big accountancy partnerships, which wanted to limit their liability for carrying out dodgy audits without becoming limited companies and so incurring extra taxes. The new corpo-rate vehicle allowed them to have it both ways by stipulating that an LLP would have limited liability but would not be a taxable entity itself (see Partnerships in crime).

The new hybrid had great appeal: not just to respectable accountants, but also to those who were up to no good. For if an LLP's mem-bers can also claim that they are not taxable in the UK, there is nothing to trouble the taxman and no inconvenient questions will be asked by the authorities about what the LLP is up to.

In Vector Aerospace LLP's case, while the firm turned over millions and made handsome profits, its members, Hopewell Investments and Provan Trading, showed no sign of this activity or any resulting tax bill. They too had evidently stayed off the taxman's radar and gave little away to prying eyes because, as UK-incorpo-rated companies, they were allowed to file ""abbreviated"" accounts giving next to no finan-cial information. What figures they did produce, signed by offshore directors at various times in Belgium and the Isle of Man, bore no relation to those included in Vector's accounts (multi-mil-lion pound balances between the two, for example, evaporated) and appeared to be no more than works of fiction. As with other cases the Eye has examined, there was no sign of intervention by the UK authorities.

The reason Lande had chosen London for this web was now clear. British companies and other legal structures provided all the obfusca-tion a man running such an operation could want. At the same time, an address in Dover Street, Mayfair, and the imprimatur of a thor-oughly respectable legal and fiscal jurisdiction like the United Kingdom, gave assurances that would satisfy the bankers who would be called on to move the funds without asking too many questions.

As one senior money-laundering compli-ance officer told the Eye: The UK has the appearance of credibility. If you send your money through UK companies in and out of London, you have clean money."" In reality the money was anything but clean; but no one was going to ask any questions. 

WEAPONS SHELLS

Britain's ill-founded reputation for corporate respectability went a long way to cop aining what MPs from a Westminster parliamentary committee on arms export control discovered when they visited Kiev in 2009 to hear about the UK's role or selling weapons from Ukraine, the old Soviet arms manufacturing heartland. They were given a list of British shell compa-nies supplying countries, including Sri Lanka, Syria, Libya and Rwanda, in breach of interna-tional sanctions.

The companies went under such unlikely names as Espace Soft Trading Ltd, which the Eye has established is directed - at least nomi-nally - from Cyprus and owned by dormant companies themselves held by Bahamas com-panies operating out of one of the world's thousands of tax haven company service addresses - just the set-up, obviously, to ship arms from Ukraine to Rwanda and Uganda.

Last year the company, located on Tooley Street around the corner from London Bridge, was reported by Business Neu, Europe's reporter Graham Stack, to be providing military aviation technology to the Eritrean regime, a supporter of murderous Islamist groups in neighbouring Somalia and firm/y under UN sanctions.

Another company, Hazel UK Ltd, manages to trade arms from eastern Europe to the Sri Lankan and Syrian regimes while registered at an address in Tiverton, Devon, under the sole directorship of a man giving a Seychelles address and listing his occupation on company filings as ""caterer"". The company, meanwhile, is said robe owned by an Isle of Man company which, filings there show, was struck off more than four years ago.

Neither Hazel nor Espace is required to publish full or audited accounts declaring their ultimate ownership, putting them well under the official radar. One senior official at HM Revenue 8, Customs, the body that is rneant to police arms exports, told a recent BBC File on 4 programme on the arms trade, ""The fact that it is clandestine and involves a series of perhaps shell companies and shadowy individuals ,d1 make this a very difficult area to investigate."" What he didn't admit was that in this game, the shell companies are very much Made in Britain. 

DEATH AND TAXES

However dubious their trade, these companies were, nominally at least, shifting real goods. But unaccounta-ble British limited liability companies have many other uses. When Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky perished M a Moscow DEAD PECKS prison in 2009 after reporting a tax Sergei Magn fraud apparently carried out by fir. revealed senior Moscow officials using his London-based client Hermitage Capital, inves-tigators from the Baltic and Russian-based Organised Crime and Corruption Reportin Project (OCCRP) sought to follow the money The financial route out of eastern Europe, the found, was through an office in Birmingham home to Nomirex Trading Ltd, a compan incorporated in 2006 and wholly owned b Voilent Trade Ltd, a company registered in Me Russian crime world's favourite outpost of Limassol, Cyprus, and itself owned by a cow pony in Belize.

In fact Birmingham's Nomirex, directed at first by a couple of British shell companies an then by a 48-year-old yoga instructor with 5 current or past UK company directorships t her name, appeared to be the conduit fo money laundering on a far larger scale than jos the alleged tax fraud.

It had been in business since 2006,a couple of years before the fraud on the Russian tax payer, and bank records obtained by th OCCRP showed that in total the company ha paid and received $365m, largel on hundreds of invoices fo ""equipment"" of various sorts, bu also on luxury items such as prop erty in Dubai and at least on upmarket car from a US Mercedes Benz dealership. It sprayed moor to front companies around the world, including Chinese opera tions and other UK companies registered in Greenwich, south east London. Despite its frenetic financial activity, however Nomirex's accounts filed at Com-panies House, abbreviated and unaudited, showed that through out this period of several years i was ""dormant"" and had a steady ",0,1368648780,null,0,1368649012,0,c9zfut3,t3_1eek63,t1_c9zfut3,t3_1eek63,null,1431146566,4,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,4

Essentially due to having a 10/11 month advantage in brain and physical development.

Essentially, in sports, the theory goes, at a very young age, the extra growth allows those older in the year to be stronger and faster, which is mistaken for better skill. As such they go through their career in the top teams getting more and better training so it becomes self fulfilling.

Perhaps all the gay people you know are fine with the word 'gay' being used to mean 'bad' (though I can't fathom how any one brain can contain that level of cognitive dissonance personally). But other people *are* affected, profoundly, by the language they encounter, including people who are discovering themselves and where they stand in society. Your admission that you wouldn't have used that word had you known that I am gay speaks volumes about the choices involved in the language we use. It's not 'censoring oneself' to use the appropriate language for a situation, and the 'free speech' argument really doesn't fly because everyone including me 'censors' themselves a few dozen times a day in conversation by choosing what words we use. I just ask you to please consider the ramifications of verbally drawing comparisons between a person's sexuality, already a controversial topic in society where people are being driven to suicide by bullying and which lies at the very core of a person's being, with things that are generically bad. I would make this exact same argument to any gay person who thinks that using the word as a term of abuse is acceptable, much as I'd argue with any woman who thinks it's a valid viewpoint to suggest that all women ought to be housewives.

A relative of [this fella](http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4152181.htm) currently costs me £3.50 per 12 hours of use on the 750w switch, dial turned to less than half the heat available. Blasting the room with full heat in the hope that it'll retain it doesn't work, it just goes straight out through the exposed (flat) roof and/or badly insulated walls. My neighbour has the same model, uses it on full blast and was paying £10 a day in electric in March. 

My electricity bill was £120 in March this year, the same in January last year, during which I worked a five day week the entire period. 

I'm sick of it. It costs more than my Council Tax and/or any other bill. Extra info: the flat gets virtually no natural daylight so even in summer I have to have some heat on, summer bills are £55-70 a month.

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"there are  a few points here, the first is that if i was wealthy and my kid broke a computer, i'd be more likely to be able and expected to pay for it.

the second is that disruptive kids come from very poor homes more often than in more involved homes, and more involved parents are less likely to be poor.

also [crime rates are higher in poorer areas](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116360/hosb1210-chap7.pdf), i'm not going to come up for possible reasons for this, because there are probably many.

in china getting a basic education is vital for your prosperity, and is a hard earned achievement, doing well in school in a poor country likely means you can find opportunities denied to most others. whereas pretty much everyone has to go through it in this country, and plenty of people drop out of school and do pretty well for themselves.",0,1368652980,null,0,false,0,c9zhjbh,t3_1edfhr,t1_c9zhjbh,t1_c9zggnt,null,1431145774,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,cacafogo,num5,,"These requests seem to keep popping up every couple weeks.  It is somewhat hypocritical of me to say this, and I think I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but I implore everyone to stop requesting that we don't talk about certain things related to our team.  I've seen people ask that we stop talking about Dempsey, stop talking about transfer rumors, stop talking about how other teams results will affect our position, and now also that we not talk about Bale.  You certainly have the least hostile sounding one, so props for that.

However, like the others I've seen it is an impractical and truthfully unfair request to make.  This is a discussion board for Tottenham Hotspur, and a pretty good one.  People are pretty level headed and the discussions tend to be great.  For many of us, there is no where else like this place.  I can't talk to most of my friends about Spurs because they don't even follow this sport.  I can't go to the nearest pub to catch a game and talk to people there because those places don't exist in my area.  I'm sure there are many people here in similar circumstances.  Let me reiterate because it is really important to understand:  there is no other place like this for many Spurs supporters to talk about Spurs.

Now that we understand that, its time to understand three key principles of reddit.  First, no one is forcing you to go into any particular thread.  If you hate seeing a ton of speculation on Bale, don't go into the threads like ""Who would you buy if we had to sell Bale?""  Sure, the front page might get loaded with similar links, but that leads to the second key principle:  reddit has a downvote feature.  Popular topics that people want to see and discuss get upvoted.  If people don't want to see it, they can downvote it; your opinion is not worth more than mine, so if something is getting lots of upvotes then what right do you have to protest (not attacking you in particular OP, just in general)?  Finally, anyone can submit content.  If someone is tired of seeing the same old discussions, nothing is stopping them from starting something new except themselves.  Change will never happen by asking people to stop posting about a particular topic, it will happen if people submit new, quality content.  If people like that, they'll submit more and so on.

I was going to say something about the topic of Bale in particular, but this is already really long and I don't have much more time.  I'll just say people are bound to talk about the fate of our best and most valuable player, and lots of people enjoy stuff like that.  Please don't tell them not to enjoy that simply because you don't.",0,1368652999,null,0,false,0,c9zhjkv,t3_1eejpb,t1_c9zhjkv,t3_1eejpb,null,1431145771,24,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,24

It doesn't matter who is at fault in a car vs motorcycle collision when you're on a motorcycle you will come off worse. Right and wrong is nice and all but the laws of physics are a cruel mistress. Yes the government could seek to build awareness with car drivers more. They really could. But given the reasons that people look at but do not see motorcycles, I have my doubts that it would have much affect. It is wrong when people pull out on bikes but Like it or not we must make sure we take charge of our own safety. I know we all like to ride fast, brake late, turn in hard, get rid of those chicken strips and so on but the public road is not a race track. If the public road were a race track it would be closed down! Race tracks don't have random diesel spills, pot holes, idiot car drivers, bidirectional traffic, blind junctions, random horse shit, etc etc. Riding too fast, too hot on the road is a daredevil's game. It really is a question of how much of a risk am I willing to take? On the track its about skill. Its a lot more fun. Want to ride fast, track, on the road drive to arrive alive.

Don't be fooled by that $3.7m. They could have easily have made it $0. The only reason they didn't was to somewhat reduce outrage if it was pointed out. 

Only small/medium companies pay corporation tax at anywhere near the stated amount. It's completely regressive and punishes small home grown businesses. 

It will be gone eventually. We might as well rip the plaster off quick and get it done with. 

Also, I think you have it the wrong way around. The large mega corps currently work on much smaller margins than 7.5%. Walmart makes 3.3% profit on their turnover, for example. They couldn't absorb 7.5% increases using their savings from not having to pay corporation tax **because they already don't pay corporation tax**.. 

Small companies would be saving 23% (on profits) and absorbing 7.5% (On totals). It would probably even its self out most of the time.

true,thashicray,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"I worked in a pub in London last summer, in the south west and after I'd finish I'd have to get on a bus to the north east where I was staying and I usually clocked off at around 5am. And it seemed it was more because the clientele lacked this 'local' quality that I hated most of them.

The pub had a relatively nice, Victorian interior with a few trinkets and such to attract a trendier crowd. These people who one would label as trendy or those with money who spent frivolous amounts Friday and Saturday in absolute decadence were in some cases some of the worst people I had ever met. 

I had grown up just north of London with some of the cheeky chappies and the neanderthals but you get used to the badgery and rarely would you get into a punch up. I avoided such things after my mate was put into a neck brace by a few guys because his hair was a bit too long, I'm going off topic... The point was that these people coming into the pub where I started working were rarely regulars but were always considered so because of the amount of money they spent, I was pretty fresh faced as I had just arrived in London and was not expecting to be treated like a complete inconvenience by these people. Seeing grown men throw hissy fits because there are no limes and threatening to sue the place, watching said men ply young girls with alcohol to get their end away and despite my personal philosophy being to bring those who looked wasted water their friends knee jerk reaction was to try it on with me because ""you can't kick us out"". I could carry on, it seemed to me like the kind of people who walk into a public toilet and think ""fuck it i'll wreck the place because I won't have to clean it and I probably won't be back."" 

I loved the bar, the regulars were very few but were nice nonetheless but it seemed to be the fact that because the pubs aim was not to attract locals that it seemed somewhat commonplace for people to arrive, get pissed and disregard anything which would happen in the wake of their drunken behavior. During these quiet afternoons where you could talk with the locals and meet the odd straggler were the times I really enjoyed, as well as the wonderful worldly staff and I think in fairness if the pub was like that 24/7 then it would have gone out of business long ago.

I've rambled on a bit but I suppose I wholeheartedly agree with you in the sense that I believe substance comes from the element of community you have in these places. Like I said I never had the best experiences in my locals but I have memories of people from various walks of life engaging in random conversations and although some may have been complete plebs others could be lovely chaps and you feel like you've gained something by meeting them.",0,1368655183,null,0,false,0,c9zid7r,t3_1edc51,t1_c9zid7r,t3_1edc51,null,1431145383,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you can't find it, I strongly recommend you either ring your bank and get them to provide it to you.

To my defence, I did live there after I left university and my friends on the whole were not students. Many close friends of mine are still there. Depending on how old you are I might even know you.

There are loads of restaurants it's true. Most of them I found pretty mediocre. But I am a food snob and I am sure the situation has changed. The farmers market is expensive but quality. 

The nightlife when I was there was dire.  The Marlowe occasionally had some good stuff (the one from Max and Paddy who wasn't Peter Kay, Stewart Lee fans).

There are indeed loads of pubs. Some excellent ones. 

I remember the streets at closing time being quite dodgy. From my friends, I hear this has not changed. There was some type of violence towards my peer group every weekend.

I'm not sure amazons operation is so intrinsic to the UK that we would stand to lose by their departure. I suspect the only loser would be them.

The UK is a huge market... and access to that market is an asset that we as a nation 'own'. If companies don't want to play by our rules, we have every right to restrict access to our markets. Amazon are able to circumvent this due to the extraordinarily complex laws that exist both in the UK, the EU and other European nations. So on paper the are a legal operation - but the extent to which they have organised their buisness to avoid paying taxes is at best hugely immoral. Amazon are a particularly exploitative company in this regard since their buisness model relies so heavily on tax funded infrastructure like the motorways. They are happy to use the things that tax money pays for, but are reticent to contribute to their maintainance or construction.

I'm not even kind of familiar with how things like that work but one assumes (I know, I know!) that even with a meter thingy the power still has to come from someone who charges an amount for the privilege. Perhaps chatting with your managing person (reading this in an isolated thread so can't refer to your comment where you mention the correct name for it) and enquiring about the tariff? It's not majorly important but I don't like working with a few real figures and then a hypothetical one. As I say it's not very important though. :)

A 2Kw electric heater at full-whack run for 8 hours a day at 10p per Kilowatt hour would cost you 4,480p a month. I'm sure that price is wildly overblown but I wanted to keep the numbers simple.

Most heaters work with convection, I'd avoid the fan-type heaters which blow air in a specific direction as that's just a further drain of energy which gives very little reward. With regards to blest placement of the heater you have it should be pretty close to wherever you spend most of your time, f it's on the other side of the room then you'll get, in order:

1: Fuck all

2: A bit less fuck all, but the other side of the room will be pleasant

3: A draft, as the warm air reaches you and forces the cold air down

4: Some several hours later; you may get a bit warmer. 

All of this is assuming a perfectly insulated space, which you've said you don't have, so only step 1 should apply.

true,ManElegant,null,null,"Regarding his dud's in the transfer market. First I guess we should mention Sahin. 

I think we all agree that he looked an excellent signing. The same reason why I think he struggled was similar to why Allen did. Lucas. 

Once he got injured the whole plan went out the window and caused several reshuffles that put people out of their comfort zone. I think the impact of loosing Lucas so early on was key to a few others players performances.

Out of that came the emergence of Henderson and the inclusion of Suso earlier than we would have expected. So while we could have expected more from top players such as Sahin and Allen (who started off very well) it had a silver lining for us.

Assaidi I feel has been a bit hard done by as when he did get a rare opportunity he, in my opinion showed he was worthy of a bit more time on the pitch further down the road. But, he didn't play him and played Sterling instead. I think we can all agree he has been a bright light we needed from our academy coupled with Wisdom and Suso has been a huge positive. 

Sturridge and Coutinho's impact has been fantastic, however I want to see how they fare next season. I'm always wary of players bought in January who start off brightly but fade once the season starts.

Injuries to Reina, Borini, Lucas, Allen, Kelly and Several Suarez suspenions coupled with the Andy Carroll farce meant Rodgers had to be reactive instead of proactive.

&gt;
&gt;Adel Taarabt sier han ikke lengre trives i QPR, og har ikke noe ønske om følge med klubben ned i championship.
&gt;
&gt;Det sier marokkaneren til qpr.no i kveld.
&gt;
&gt;QPR Scandinavia var til stede under klubbens årlige sponsorarrangement på Loftus Road tirsdag kveld, og fikk flere intervjuer med spillerne. Den mest åpenhjertige var Adel Taarabt.

&gt; QPRs supportere har vært fantastiske, men jeg føler jeg har gitt det jeg kan gi for klubben. Jeg har to sesonger bak meg i Premier League, og på grunn av nedrykket føler jeg det er på tide å gå videre.

&gt;Adel Taarabt kom til QPR fra Tottenham, og var hovedårsaken til opprykket til Premier League i 2011. 19 scoringer og et betydelig antall målgivende pasninger ble i meste laget for motstanderne på nivå 2 i England.

&gt;I Premier League har det imidlertid gått tregt, både i form av manglende scoringer og tidvist svakt spill. Taarabt mener manglende kvalitet på banen har sammenheng med trivsel.
&gt;
&gt;Taarabt sier rett ut at han ikke har det så godt i QPR.
&gt;
&gt;Det har kommet nye folk, og jeg trives egentlig ikke så godt her lengre. Man skal jo være lykkelig, ikke sant, sier Taarabt.
&gt;
&gt;Hva mener du?
&gt;
&gt;Vel, jeg er ung og ønsker å spille kamper. De siste ukene har jeg ikke spilt så mye. Og skal man spille bra fotball, må man også være lykkelig som person, er svaret.
&gt;
&gt;Familiegrunner
&gt;Ifølge Taarabt er det så langt ingen klubber som har meldt sin interesse, men:
&gt;
&gt;Jeg vil i utgangspunktet spille i Premier League. Samtidig vil jeg være i en klubb der jeg er nærmere familien min i Frankrike. Vi må vente og se hva som skjer, avslutter midtbanespilleren.
&gt;
&gt;qpr.no kommer med flere intervjuer fra sponsorarrangementet denne og neste uke. Bl.a. Chris Samba (som supporterklubben har sponset), Shaun Derry, Esteban Granero, Jamie Mackie og klubbdirektør Philip Beard.


Impromptu translation:

    Wants away from QPR
    
    Adel Taarabt says he no longer feels right in QPR, and has no desire to follow the club down into the Championship.
    
    So said the Moroccan to qpr.no this evening.
    
    ""QPR's supporters have been fantastic, but I feel I have given what I can give for the club. I have two seasons behind me in the Premier League, and because of the relegation, I feel it's time to move on.""
    
    Adel Taarabt came to QPR from Tottenham, and was the main factor behind the promotion to the Premier League in 2011. 19 goals and a considerable amount of assists was too much for the opponents at the second level of English football.
    
    In the Premier League, however, things have been tougher, both in the form of reduced goalscoring and weak play. Taarabt opines that the lacking quality on the pitch has something to do with how he feels at the club.
    
    ""New people have arrived, and I don't really feel like I fit in here anymore. You're supposed to be happy, after all, aren't you?"", says Taarabt.
    
    ""What do you mean?""
    
    ""Well, I'm young and I want to  play games. The last weeks I haven't played that much. And if you want to play good football, you have to be happy as a person"", is the answer.
    
    Family reasons
    
    According to Taarabt there are so far no clubs that have noted their interest, but: 
    
    ""I want, in the first place, to play in the Premier League. At the same time I want to be in a club where I am closer to my family in France. We must wait and see what happens"", the midfielder concludes.

I have read about the lengths they go to until it has curled my toes. It's unhealthily obsessive. I've also seen a little bit of this with my own sister and nephews in the UK. It can wreck the childhoods of kids/teens who are forced into a hobby/obsession/potential multi-million dollar career as a top baseball/whatever player that they wouldn't necessarily want in the first place if they hadn't been put under such huge pressure by their parents, they were quite happy dossing around on their bikes, climbing trees with their mates and reading Harry Potter. 

So, your 2000's &gt; our 1960s-80s, if you would care to compare the two continents and decades. But, to summarise, there's something intrinsically ingrained into sport (and I don't know what as I'm not a sports psychologist) that just makes people go a bit batshit in the head. Or, in the case of the parents, maybe a combination of that and the bloody-minded will that, even if they failed or lead a relatively mediocre life, their offspring WILL succeed, damn it. I'm sure it's all an evolution thing. Success from competition = more breeding = survival of the bloodline.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Alphaiv just pointed something out that made me realise I've kind of been missing your point. 

&gt;Well because the point is that they avoid taxes before they make any profit. The UK branch overpays for stock purchased from their Luxembourg branch and then sells the stock in the UK for about the same as they purchased it for. So the UK branch never makes any profit (or barely any), its all made by their Luxembourg branch who sell the stock to the UK branch at an inflated price.

I was thinking you meant they were making the sales, getting the profits and sending them offshore later. I see your point now, it would be basically impossible to stop. 

If that's all true however it's a bit of a bullshit claim for companies to say 'Well it's the law. We're technically not doing anything illegal, it's just clever accounting' as if that makes it morally fine in this context. It would be fine if it was all a product of a lazy government but if the main reason is it's just really hard to do then that argument does not change whether it's wrong...y'know, morally in a kind of spirit of the law kind of way.

It's actually fairly standard in other parts of the world.  Many places even have a non-negotiable death sentence.

Stuart Hazell only got 38 years because the judge couldn't be 100% sure the murder was sexually motivated - if he had, it would have been a whole life tariff.

Judging from what I've seen in the April Jones trial, I think Mark Bridger will end up caged forever.

true,ArgyleEd,null,null,"Again it's pretty varied and as a fan of a smaller club I don't see the worst of it. Almost every match I've been to has had a light police presence, I've got off the train, wandered along to a pub and then to the match without any hassle from police or fans. Away fan coaches are slightly different, they are often escorted by police for the last mile or so, it is also against the law to possess alcohol on a football fan coach at any point in the trip so coaches are often searched (I hardly ever use the coaches so this is mostly based on what I've heard from other people) Having a police escort to/from the station has happened to me but not in the lower leagues, in bigger games it's also common for the police to make the away fans stay in the ground for some time after the final whistle so that the home fans can disperse.

Some pubs decide for themselves to be specifically for home fans, in some cases at bigger matches I believe the police do specify which fans are allowed to go where. I do check ahead of travelling what pubs are in the area, partly to see if they have any problem with away fans but mostly just to find good ones, there's rarely any issue with where to drink in the lower leagues

The highest level of police involvement in what away fans can do is in what are called bubble matches. These are games where the police believe there is a high risk of trouble, usually in games between big rivals with a history of aggression. In these games you don't buy a ticket for the match, you buy a voucher. You then have to get on an official coach from the home ground of your club to a service station near the destination ground at which point the only available away tickets for the match will be given out for the vouchers. This allows the police to totally control the away fans from beginning to end of their journey.

Personally I feel proud, to live in one of the greatest countries on Earth. No country has made more of an impact/influence on humanity.
We have great people, and the country itself is incredible.

We are in the perfect spot, it's not too hot, not too cold, doesn't rain too much or too little. We don't have to worry about Earthquakes, or tornadoes/cyclones, no tsunamis or tidal waves, very few hurricanes, no volcanoes. We have no dangerous wildlife, we are even one of the safest countries on Earth, I can go for a walk and have no fear of being shot or stabbed.
I don't get burnt, won't die of dehydration, I won't freeze to death, be mauled by bears or bitten by spiders. We don't even have the risk of hitting large animals while driving.

Our architecture is stunning, some of the villages in wales are amazing, my own town is built in a Tudor style. Castles!

Yet while having all this we can still go mountain climbing, cave diving, skiing, sailing. We have marshes, mountains, fields and if you like the sort of thing some of the best surfing in the world.

Some police forces are better or worse than others, I know South Yorkshire Police have a bit of a reputation for being over the top, they once stopped a coach of our fans from getting to a match at Doncaster Rovers (not a club we have any rivalry with) and then escorted them out of the county because they ""had intelligence"" that they were potential trouble makers, no one knows why, there have been similar incidents with other fans. 

I honestly think a lot of police measures aren't needed any more and often are quite an inconvenience but it's difficult to know what the right balance is, football fans quite rightly complain about being treated like criminals without actually having done anything but if something big ever kicked off at a match which was seen to be under policed that would create a scandal.

I support Plymouth, we had a few games with big clubs when we spent some years in the Championship a few years back but now we've dropped down to League Two the policing is much less obvious and intrusive except for matches between us and Exeter where it is fairly serious although it us unfortunately with good reason, both clubs have a nasty element to their followings that only ever turns out for games against each other, I've never personally had any issues but there have been a few incidents of trouble between our clubs.",0,1368660830,null,0,1368661343,0,c9zkbi7,t3_1eeli8,t1_c9zkbi7,t1_c9zjvya,null,1431144463,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,Webbie27,null,null,"Bradley Stoke is fairly close to Aztec West, very nice area to live in and lots of facilities locally to that area. As I said it's *fairly close* and depending on what area you find to live in, it can range from a 10-30 minute walk, even quicker if you decide to ride a bike.

The Bradley Stoke area itself has a very *clean* feel from other parts of Bristol as a lot of it is fairly recently built. In the local vicinity there is indeed a Tesco's as well as a group of other stores and establishments such as Estate Agents, Fast Food, Pound store etc. Very varied. Not only that there's a gym there too. If that's not enough *literally* across the road is a Leisure center including a gym, swimming pool and the local library. Also if you do end up staying here for a while, long term and settle down etc, there's a high school near the leisure center area. Around this area of Bradley Stoke there's a varied amount of Houses ranging from small, huge and flats. I'd say it's your best bet if you can afford it.

Closer to the Aztec West side of Bradley Stoke, you have an Aldi super market, a few takeaways including a Dominoes and Pizza Hut. There's also a pub near those too and across the street I believe is the clinic. It's all very localized and makes living a breeze. 

On the other side of Aztec West is Patchway (Live there myself) It's much more spacious when it comes to shops and such, but I believe the housing is cheaper as they're older. There's not immediate supermarket, closest one would be Asda/Morrisons in Cribbs Causeway which depending on where you live ranges from a 5-40 minute walk. It's got *a lot* there. This includes a mall, B&amp;Q, cinema, other entertainment venues, restaurants and such like that.

It's a very varied area based on which side of Aztec West you live on. Living in Patchway my whole life I know where to get to all the shops or to Cribbs, Bradley Stoke on all that. But if you want a more convenient method of living as well as fairly local to your placement Bradley Stoke is by far your best bet. You could easily live and work for quite a few months without actually requiring a car.

Oh and although I wouldn't fully recommend this, I may as well tell you seeing as you may find it beneficial, there are two hotels in the Aztec West area, the Aztec West Hotel &amp; Spa, and the Hilton, they're fairly pricey but if you really wanted a good idea of the area that is always an option, as I said, I wouldn't recommend it, but yes, it is indeed an option present for you.

I bought my last 3 white goods at John Lewis rather than whereever. That's because John Lewis pays fair tax and supports its staff with profit sharing, and its white goods price is pretty much the same as anywhere else.

Although she does say that suspects (usually) have the right to anonymity at arrest, if you read the letter, the main point she is making is that suspects should not have the right to anonymity at charge.

From the first paragraph:

&gt;In particular I am concerned that the refusal of some police forces to name suspects who have been charged undermines transparency in the criminal justice system and risks the possibility that witnesses and other victims might not come forward.

She then later goes on to say:

true,Darknezz,tennant,Tennant,"This is actually quite brilliant, I think. Answering a ""why"" means they never have to name the Doctor, whether the audience hears the naming or not, and the question, ""Why is he called 'The Doctor'?"" has been asked plenty of times before, without ever really giving us an answer. Why should he be called the Doctor?

We've seen the Doctor's darkness. We've seen him use his unmatched intelligence to create unending, borderline horrific torture (*The Family of Blood*), we know that he was capable of dooming his own species (for the good of the rest of creation, yes, but that's still a tough call to make), and we know that he's capable of just about anything he sets himself to.

What if he's called the Doctor because he had to remind himself to be a force for good? What if, before he ran away, he saw what the Time Lords were to become in the Time Wars, and knew that he could become as corrupt as them? What if, then, he hid from himself (with something like the Chameleon Arch), erasing his reasons for doing what he did, and leaving behind his new moniker as the only thing he had to go by? What if he's called ""the Doctor,"" because he knew what he was capable of, and knew that he had to try to live up to a better ideal?

It would actually be a really interesting mystery for the Doctor to have to solve his own origin as ""the Doctor,"" lest the Great Intelligence erase him and his companions. It would parallel what Davros had tried to do at the end of S4, when he tried to show the Doctor what he truly was. It could be a really interesting way to flesh out the Doctor's pre-show history, and to get another look at Time Lord culture.

This is likely not the case. The way the show's been written this season, and from the trailers for this episode, it's pretty clear that the mystery is, indeed, ""who"" and not ""why."" Hell, the title of the episode is explicit in making that point.

But RTD's endings were frequently plagued with unsatisfying *deus ex machina* that undermined the awesome promise of his premises. (For example, a full-fledged war between Daleks and Cybermen sounds pretty awesome. Less awesome when you compact it into 5 minutes of screen time and then solve the problem by pulling a big lever that's been sonicked with technobabble.)

Looking at Moffat's finales, ""The Wedding of River Song"" is simply awful in almost every possible way (even if we discount the fact that it's inexplicably retread of the series 5 finale).

So I'm going to go with ""The Big Bang"": It's studded with cleverness. It's a perfect conclusion that capitalizes on an entire season of build-up. And the emotional beats are just perfect. The culmination in Amy's ""... something blue"" just brings a silly grin to my face every single time. It's so clever and so justified and so emotionally satisfying.

In Journey to the Center of the TARDIS, we not only see the Doctor teaching Clara how to fly the TARDIS, but (and this is what caught my attention) while she is wandering through the TARDIS getting to know her better she comes across a book.  She flips a page and says, ""ahh so that's who.""  Which I believe is obviously answering her initial question to the Doctor, ""Doctor Who?""
Which would mean Clara knows the Doctor's name.  Or, maybe just who he is, and this was a red herring of sorts.  
But Clara clearly jumps around in space and time, and there is a whole lot about both Clara and River we don't know about yet.  I would not be at all surprised if the two tied into eachother and that's why the Doctor doesnt seem to feel any sort of remorse or guilt in flirting with Clara knowing he's married to River.  Also, why River has not showed up once with Clara around (if it's her she couldn't be in the same place at the same time as her.)

Edit:  I would love to hear anyone's thoughts on my theory.  Do you guys think I should open a self post for bigger discussion or is it a bunk theory?  I really don't know it all just came to me while catching up tonight.

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"Rochester is a lovely, quaint and very old English town with a lovely, quaint history. The high street is pretty, old English architecture and old-fashioned, quaint and traditional paving slabs on the streets (which, to a certain extent, you could use as a measure to value the historical value and therefore care of a town's history/and therefore care of it via means such as council funding – if the residents don’t give a shit and if it’s not of historical interest then it just gets filled with concrete).*

It has a really small castle but it still has a castle (these are not common in our towns, for your info), and it's forever linked with excellent British literature through Charles Dickens. However, there's no getting away from the fact that a) very little goes on there and b) it is sandwiched between Strood and Chatham, which are two of the worst three areas I came across during my five years of living in the Medway towns. Additionally c) the high street is parallel to the route between Strood and Rochester, albeit set back a few dozen feet. They’ve obviously been built up around it, to the town’s dismay. 

Rochester has the river Medway running through it (adjacent to Strood, which I have heard called ‘the sweaty armpit of Kent’), but they are at least separated by a river and a bridge. 

Rochester is going to be much less affordable but equally ten times more desirable as a location to live in than Strood or Chatham (its neighbours). That said, I’m not entirely familiar with the back streets of Rochester and, as with almost EVERYwhere in our country, you can have a town with a shit street and then you walk for five minutes and find your ideal, blissful suburb (which will cost you more). My father knows Rochester well, I can and will ask if you want me to. 

There are various means to look up stats on things like crime, schooling and house price rises and/or falls that we can help you with if you tell us your potential postcode. 

I see your edit about mixed views, here’s my response: Medway – as I said, very mixed. Would really help to know what your budget is. Canterbury: beautiful, a bit like Rochester as I described above, but WAY pricier (it has far more history); it’s also a student City (it’s no longer a town if I recall correctly) and as such it gets a bit yobby/loudmouthed on weekend nights, and you might only want to take your family (assuming you have young kids) out to dinner when you know you can avoid drunken, lary students (however, please note, Canterbury students are mild in comparison to many parts in the UK). Maidstone: I’m sure I’ve been there, but I can’t remember it, and I don’t know why. It doesn’t have a good rep. 

*I have not been to Rochester for 15+ years. You need to visit or find someone who's been there more recently to fact check that it hasn't turned into a dive.

I don't know enough about taxes to figure out my weekly take-home pay, but a brief look at some rental websites suggests I should be spending £100-200 a week on rent for a two-bedroom place. This, BTW, isn't my budget, just what I currently expect to pay. If I'm way off, please let me know.

I'm interested in these means to look up stats on schooling, crime, and changes in house prices. Again, I won't know my postcode until I'm offered a job, but do you know where I could find this information for myself?

As soon as that money sits still in one place, problems start to arise - it means fewer people are being employed, people start to save in case they also lose their jobs, and the lack of spending then causes more people to lose their jobs. It's a vicious circle.

That's why economics is not a zero-sum game - if you can find a way to make money flow through the system better, you will get more and more people economically active and a virtuous cycle of improvement is formed. More people can find jobs; they are more likely to spend; their spending employs more people.

Small businesses, like the restaurants and shops in the video, are probably particularly good because they do not tend to make huge profits - money which would probably then sit around doing very little.

As a result, it is a good thing if people come to this country and set up successful small businesses. If those businesses didn't exist, the slack would not necessarily be picked up by another business. In fact it would have the opposite effect - the people not employed by the non-existent business would not be able to spend much money supporting other businesses.

Personally, I think that 'type' of accommodation is more important if you're thinking about college 'personality' or whatever, as there's not much difference. If you go for en suite (not to generalize too much here... **i.e. take this with a pinch of salt**) but there's a good chance you'll end up with the more 'studious-types'. That said.. it really won't matter *that* much and if you're willing to put yourself out there and make friends it can be nice to have a 'safe haven' from all the fun and craziness that is first year.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I posted this in response to a reply someone made to this comment, and I feel like it pretty accurately sums up my feelings about the situation we are finding ourselves in.

Pellegrini's a great alternative to Mancini. He's not an upgrade. I'm excited to see what will happen next year, and short term I think Pellegrini has the ability to improve the squad even more than Mancini would have (and he would have), due to his expertise in Europe. While the potential also exists for us to undo all of our progress over the last few years, the more I learn about Pellegrini, the less likely I think that is. He seems to be very flexible, and willing to adapt to the style of play that best suits the squad he has, which is great because the last thing we need is another 2-3 year transition period before we can compete for anything. So short term, I think he''ll be great.

But like devineman, I question his ability to establish a long term dynasty of the sort Mancini was in the process of establishing. We were the amiable bad boys of English football, the guys that you didn't want to like, but really wanted to like you. We had the best squad, that eveyone accused of being mercenaries, and hated us for buying them. Our manager was a fashionable jerk, and we were consistently getting better results than the established clubs. We were the baddie that the plucky underdog would beat in the final in the movies (and evidently the FA cup), and afterwards would give them the thumbs up and make them feel good about themselves, because at the end of the day, we were tough, and maybe a bit conflicted internally, but not mean. Now, who knows what we'll be. I'm sure you've all seen the Grantland article posted earlier about the image Mancini was cultivating, and it's role in getting him fired—which devineman ironically took issue with—but where I disagree with the article, and where I assume devineman would disagree as well, is that that was an image that didn't suit us.

City are a Manchester club. The club, like the city it calls home, has had a rough, but storied history, of being awesome despite everything. First it was urban poverty durring the Industrial revolution, then the Germans (Uwe's grandad was a dick), then deindustrialization and more poverty, then Thatcher and more poverty, but some great music, then the IRA and more music. The club has boom-and-bust cycles just like the City. We could have traded off that tough but deep attitude. Pellegrini, while an excellent manager, doesn't fit that image, in fact, he might as well be you're grandad.

true,AnythingButNormal,rose,Rose,"This is actually a very difficult question, because it does depend on your criteria. I just wandered through the list, and found myself ruling out some episodes that I really liked because they had some intrinsic flaw to them. 

""Vincent and the Doctor"" is outstanding - except for the alien monster. That was pretty poorly done, and detracts from what would otherwise be a near pitch-perfect episode. Vincent's interaction with the museum curator is just a lovely touch, as is the dedication on *Sunflowers*.

""A Good Man Goes To War"" has all the hallmarks of what should have been a utterly ass-kicking ep, but was so rushed that it felt wasted. At least a two-episode arc for this one, and it could have been truly glorious.

I'm going to have to go with ""Father's Day"" as my favorite (if you'll excuse the American spelling), with ""Rose"" a close second. 

""Rose"" is so full of potential energy, like a coiled spring, ready to leap out onto the world, yelling ""Here I am, just like old times, only *better*!"" but suffers from a some very cheesy effects and the saddling of us with Mickey for the foreseeable future. The immediate connection that Rose and the Doctor make is very intense, and the way that she flowers in his presence is really indicative of the way that the Doctor always brings out, if not the best, then the potential in his companions.

""Father's Day"" doesn't, to my mind, miss a beat, and touches on the kind of story that only a time traveler can tell, even if it is the cliched ""what if I change my own past"" story. The tenderness of the interactions between Rose and her father are heartbreaking, and I tear up a bit just recalling the raw emotion that Billie puts into her performance in the scene where he comes to realize who she is, and touches her face - something she has always craved, and now, guiltily, indulges in.

Its rare to see equally incredible pace and acceleration, because pace relies more on stride length (long legs and height), as opposed to acceleration, which favors fast turnover (short players). Torres seems to beat this problem by immediately getting into his maximum stride from a standstill (watch his runs in the video), as opposed to most tall people who take shorter steps to get to full stride. This is a lot harder, and takes much more quad/hamstring strength and balance.

It's also the first definition in the OED. This is not hard; it's utterly basic economics, and frankly your inability to grasp it reflects how completely baseless your entire argument is.""

How old are you?

""You keep saying that. Responsibility is not a beneficial or virtuous thing to have if it doesn't have a specific reason.""

What? What kind of fucked up irresponsible world do you live in? Are you not allowed to do anything on your own unless you have a specific reason to do it? Jesus buddy, sounds like you live in some sort of orwellian dictatorship.

""Why? The only person that benefits from poor information is the person selling overpriced petrol. The consumer pays more, and his competition are unfairly robbed of a sale that an informed consumer would give to them. Finally, while you're educating yourself please work on your grammar.""

Again. You can apply this logic to EVERY market price. And please, define 'overpriced' can you? No you can't :) I asked you this previously but you've skirted the question. Its just a pathetic political point scorer that's been used since ancient times. You have absolutely no idea what a fair price is and you have absolutely no idea what overpricing means.

Paying money for things does not make people happier. So why isn't everything free? That's what you seem to want isn't it?

""Yes, the same logic could be applied to other things but it already is, and I gave you two examples of that.""

I can think of no law that forces to provide the market price of their competitors. Its also impossible for consumers to know those other types of information or prohibitively expensive. It is absolutely not expensive for consumers to gather price information from different source which is the reason why it is not regulated and companies are not forced to provide it. Thus your examples are meaningless in this discussion.

The only circumstance where consumers are forced to pay the price given by a single company is in a monopoly. And if a petrol station was a monopoly it would be absurd to ask it to provide the prices of its competitors.

Anyway, all the funding that pirate sites receive is entirely available to an official seller too.  They could bung exactly the same set of adverts on a page.

As for donations: if the artists weren't so tied up with the record companies, they could receive donations directly from their fans.  Kind of like kickstarter, I would imagine.  ""Want a new album?  We need $X before we can go into the studio""

The point is: the costs that a pirate site incurs are not per-item of media, especially since the media _isn't_ downloaded from the pirate site.

that's not true. this is not a case of a single asian person raping a single white person. This was an organised gang of asian men raping young white girls. It was not a one off. It was systematic, a business, and went on for years. 

And then duplicate it in 3 other towns. exact same thing. 

&gt; When a white British persons rapes another white British person, it's just a problem, obviously.

well if it was organised white gangs raping young asian girls, I think people would say there was a cultural or racial problem there. It would probably be classified as a racist crime in some way. 

&gt; I don't think this has anything to do with culture. It's to do with these guys being sick bastards and a series of massive failures on part of the police and social services.

It is all of those things, not either/or. 4 different groups doing exactly the same thing, all asian men targeting only white girls. clearly that has a cultural element. never an asian woman targeted. how do you explain that, if not by appealing to culture or race?

I'd agree, they seem far more willing to work in gangs to do this. But, as the police have pointed out, if you look at the sex offenders list, the majority are white. But that doesn't make a good story. Also I'd point out that just because the girls were white, does not mean they were targeting them. It seems far more likely they were just targeting any vulnerable girls they could find. If there any more information on the other cases, I've not read enough to assume that in all cases all victims were white.

&gt;well if it was organised white gangs raping young asian girls, I think people would say there was a cultural or racial problem there. It would probably be classified as a racist crime in some way.

As above, it seems they just work alone raping people instead.

&gt;It is all of those things, not either/or. 4 different groups doing exactly the same thing, all asian men targeting only white girls. clearly that has a cultural element. never an asian woman targeted. how do you explain that, if not by appealing to culture or race?

&gt;As someone said on the radio yesterday, it's cultural in the same way that middle-aged white men going on sex holidays to Thailand is. 

Don't have enough information on all four gangs to say that every woman was white, as I wrote above.

As for the Thailand thing, I wouldn't say that was cultural. That's just an easy way to go and have sex.

A statistically significant amount. There's millions of Muslims in the country, so it seems odd to pin four examples on all of them.

&gt; If the roles were reversed, I'm pretty sure we'd be hearing about the trend of white supremacist rape gangs sweeping the country.

That doesn't seem very likely. When the story broke in Rochdale there was media coverage about Asian men, but the one in Derby, where most of the perpetrators were white, didn't garner as much media coverage.

&gt; well depends how you define hordes. how many is a horde?

This too needs to be statistically significant. There's something like 2.5m Muslims, so we'd need to see thousands of rape gangs for it to actually matter.

&gt; of course it is the men who are responsible. the question the article is asking is why they are all from identical backgrounds, and all targeted just white women.
It obviously has something to do with their community/background/culture, in the same way that the systematic abuse of children by catholic priests has something to do with the culture and background of celibacy and secrecy.

My theory about this is that when you spend all day every day getting called upon by various security services telling you how bad things *could* get and how everyone would blame *you* if they happen, it's a natural reaction - self-defence in effect - to start adopting a security-over-liberty posture.

I disagree. With the Philpott scandal, we get a lot of articles asking ""did our culture cause this?"". With suicide rates going up, people ask ""did our culture cause this?"".

As you get in contact with letting agents, tell them what you're looking for so that they can tell you about anywhere you might have missed. If you want to be more-thorough, [start contacting Oxford letting agents](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=letting+agents+oxford). You might get a better deal if you can find a private letting (not through an agent): try [the lists on dailyinfo.co.uk](http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/homes-to-let) (an excellent Oxford-based website) if you're interested in that.

Council Tax is charged 10 months of the year (no Council Tax in February or March), and is based upon the perceived value of the house in which you're living. All houses are [categorised into a ""band""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_tax#Current_bands): A through H, and the council charges based on these bands. Within Oxford, you'll pay between £107 (band A) and £327 (band H) per month (again, only 10 months of the year) [[source](http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decCB/How_much_will_you_pay_occw.htm)]. Outside Oxford itself, it can vary - where I live right now, in Kennington - just outside the ring road in the Vale of White Horse - Council Tax ranges from £100 (band A) to £300 (band H).

You'll also have to pay water and sewerage rates (you won't get a choice in your water company; it'll probably be [Thames Water](http://www.thameswater.co.uk/)), and energy (electricity and gas) - ask your landlord about whether you're allowed to change the energy supplier, because most folks can get a better deal by switching: when the time comes, [MoneySavingExpert has some great tips](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/you-switch-gas-electricity) on picking the best-value energy providers based on your usage: in fact, that website is great in general for planning your finances and getting the best deal.

Depending on where you're coming from, you might find that UK rental tradition is a little more-restrictive than what you're used to. In much of continental Europe, for example, tenants on long leases tend to get a lot of freedom to redecorate, and enjoy a lot of protection over how much notice has to be given to ask them to move out. In the UK, some such freedoms and protections exist, but they're not as strong as e.g. Germany or Sweden.

If you are coming from outside the UK, also be aware that Britain operates a TV licensing scheme: if you plan to watch ""live"" television (whether broadcast, cable, or online), you need to [buy a TV license](https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay/index.aspx) (currently £145.50 per year). If you don't, you don't have to pay (but you'll need to tell the TV licensing organisation that, or they'll assume that you're simply neglecting to buy one).

I hope that gives you some starting points. Here's a reminder of the websites you really ought to visit:

* [RightMove.co.uk](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent.html) - find property to rent

There have also been white people going around raping people. But again, their race is never mentioned as a factor.

&gt;right...I still don't get your point. Is someone saying that non-asians who rape people are alright? that they should be allowed to rape? that they don't exist? 

No, I'm saying that although the majority of people who rape others are white in this country, there does not seem to be the same inspection of our culture going on as it does with these cases.

&gt;I disagree. With the Philpott scandal, we get a lot of articles asking ""did our culture cause this?"". With suicide rates going up, people ask ""did our culture cause this?"". Journalists will always look for answers as to why things happened, and you can't write off culture as though it doesn't exist. 

The Philpott thing was a horrible cheap shot at benefits, and it was nothing to do with culture regardless. For suicide rates, I've not seen much written.

&gt;they were all white, check the records. 

You don't seem to know how burden of proof works. You made the claim, you back it up.

For what it's worth, in the Derby case at least, the judge said race was 'coincidental.'

well I don't see anything wrong with her statements. she's not pinning it on muslims; she's asking about the causes. It's strange that people can't distinguish between the two. 

It's like saying the culture of the catholic church and of it's priests didn't contribute toward the abuse scandal. 

&gt; Not that much, but it needs to be enough to be relevant in the overall picture. Even 1% should be worrying, and that would be about 250,000 people.

I think the fact it happened with one single gang is worrying. that we have 3 more is even more worrying. but I'm still not sure what you're saying; we should worry about it because it's only 4 gangs so far? 

&gt; This one.

""there was no link between the men."" 

This story obviously got coverage, and rightly so. But it was hardly comparable to the systematic and organised group in Oxford, plus the 3 others, who knew each other and worked together to sell teenagers to others. 

And for the record, every crime is worth looking at for contributing factors. 'what made these white men target young white girls?' is a valid question. 

&gt; In a way where their culture/background/whatever would be relevant enough to discuss. 

how do you determine whether it is relevant? who decides? 

&gt; Thus far we've seen anecdotes that don't tell us anything.

we've seen 4 convicted gangs of asian men targeting white women. they are not anecdotes. 

&gt; The abuse does, yes, but something like race doesn't.

no one is saying the colour of their skin made them do this. they are asking what role their culture and religion played in causing them to commit these crimes, or think that this was ok. 

&gt; The argument is that there is zero evidence to indicate that their race is leading to this being a systematic problem.

again, no one is proposing race caused this.

in organised gangs, selling a particular other race to white men? If yes, then race would be mentioned as a factor. 

&gt;  I'm saying that although the majority of people who rape others are white in this country, there does not seem to be the same inspection of our culture going on as it does with these cases.

because rape as a single offence is different from an organised gang grooming, raping, abusing and selling a particular race for profit. 

&gt; The Philpott thing was a horrible cheap shot at benefits, and it was nothing to do with culture regardless. For suicide rates, I've not seen much written.

what you have or haven't seen does mean it doesn't exist. And whether you think Philpott articles were a cheap shot doesn't help your case that people didn't question whether culture was the cause.

right, which is not a statement that the victims were not all white.

Race... or culture? 

I remember reading about a custom in China whereby if someone is injured in a street accident *the public will not make any attempt to help the person because they may be held personally liable for the well-being of that person from there onwards*. 

That resulted in several example videos hitting the web of someone who had been hit by a vehicle lying in the road - injured - with huge numbers of people walking straight past them. 

The point being that that simply wouldn't happen elsewhere in the world. Is it not reasonable then to report ""hundreds of Asian people walked past the wounded man as he lay in the road?"".

Meanwhile on Reddit there's a report about an Australian woman who was jailed in a Muslim country after SHE was raped by her colleagues. 

The uncomfortable truth for the PC crowd is that the people they're trying to defend from racism *aren't always good people*. I agree entirely with not encouraging racism for the sake of racism - but don't be blinded from the hard evidence either.

It's strange that people can't distinguish between the two. It's like saying the culture of the catholic church and of it's priests didn't contribute toward the abuse scandal.

No, she's pinning it on the boogeyman of multiculturalism. That isn't a cause.

&gt; I think the fact it happened with one single gang is worrying. that we have 3 more is even more worrying. but I'm still not sure what you're saying; we should worry about it because it's only 4 gangs so far?

I'm saying that something like race isn't a factor because we found four cases with similar characteristics; and yes, the fact that any crime happens at all is an issue, but that's another conversation entirely.

&gt; ""there was no link between the men.""

&gt; This story obviously got coverage, and rightly so. But it was hardly comparable to the systematic and organised group in Oxford, plus the 3 others, who knew each other and worked together to sell teenagers to others.

&gt; And for the record, every crime is worth looking at for contributing factors. 'what made these white men target young white girls?' is a valid question.

But that's the thing, the investigation wasn't ""why were these *white* men doing this?"", because it was rightly judged that race didn't player a factor. The same should happen here.

&gt; how do you determine whether it is relevant? who decides?

Research would usually be a good starting point. If something is happening systematically then the likes of culture are relevant. However, a handful of cases don't provide us with that.

&gt; we've seen 4 convicted gangs of asian men targeting white women. they are not anecdotes.

Actually, that's exactly what it is.

&gt; no one is saying the colour of their skin made them do this. they are asking what role their culture and religion played in causing them to commit these crimes, or think that this was ok.

..which is irrelevant given that, again, a few cases tell us very little.

&gt; again, no one is proposing race caused this.

Not overtly, no, but the article hints at it and the content strongly implies it.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; No, she's pinning it on the boogeyman of multiculturalism. That isn't a cause.

define multiculturalism. she is quite right that this case represents a clash of cultures. 

&gt; I'm saying that something like race isn't a factor because we found four cases with similar characteristics

even if we had one single case, it doesn't make sense to say that race isn't a factor. how do you know? are you willing to engage and find out, or are you too afraid to speak about it at all? 

as you know, I'm not saying race is a factor, but culture and religion. But you can't just say ""it's not a cause because I said so and we only have 4 cases"". If it is a cause, it is a cause, and we should try to find out.

&gt; But that's the thing, the investigation wasn't ""why were these white men doing this?"", because it was rightly judged that race didn't player a factor. 

are you talking about the criminal investigation? obviously that doesn't ask that. But once they have been convicted, people will ask all kinds of questions. If there seems to be a cultural element or pattern (if for example all the white men were catholic priests) - do you think it would have been worth asking the question? 

&gt; Research would usually be a good starting point. If something is happening systematically then the likes of culture are relevant. However, a handful of cases don't provide us with that.

again, culture can be relevant without a landslide of data. Culture/race is relevant in an anti-semitic attack, you don't need to see a pattern. asking the question is not wrong. 

&gt; Actually, that's exactly what it is.

convictions, not tall tales. 

&gt; ..which is irrelevant given that, again, a few cases tell us very little.

which you cannot demonstrate. If it is irrelevant, show the evidence. Address the issue. 

&gt; Not overtly, no, but the article hints at it and the content strongly implies it.

in your head, maybe. perhaps you're looking for it. 

&gt; But not the main factor. There is far too much focus on this in general, rather than the men themselves.

no one says it has to be the main factor to be a factor.

true,Bilgistic,eng-GreaterLondon,Civilisation,"&gt; define multiculturalism. she is quite right that this case represents a clash of cultures.

No, the point is that culture has little to do with it. Do we berate all men because of the disparity between male sex abusers and female ones?

&gt; even if we had one single case, it doesn't make sense to say that race isn't a factor. how do you know? are you willing to engage and find out, or are you too afraid to speak about it at all? as you know, I'm not saying race is a factor, but culture and religion. But you can't just say ""it's not a cause because I said so and we only have 4 cases"". If it is a cause, it is a cause, and we should try to find out.

Don't assume that I want us to ignore everything. What I'm saying is that it's wrong to assume that race or culture automatically played a part.

&gt; are you talking about the criminal investigation? obviously that doesn't ask that. But once they have been convicted, people will ask all kinds of questions. If there seems to be a cultural element or pattern (if for example all the white men were catholic priests) - do you think it would have been worth asking the question?

Yes, but only because the Catholic Church has had a history of systematically hiding or down playing horrible things like child abuse, so people would question this. However, they should not assume that this was *because* they were priests.

&gt; again, culture can be relevant without a landslide of data. Culture/race is relevant in an anti-semitic attack, you don't need to see a pattern. asking the question is not wrong.

Only because that anti-semetic attack has presumably been proven as such; where's the proof that culture is a systematic cause here?

&gt; convictions, not tall tales.

Didn't say they were. What I did say was that four cases aren't enough to assume things.

&gt; which you cannot demonstrate. If it is irrelevant, show the evidence. Address the issue.

You're asking me to prove a negative, which is impossible. Since you're the one making the assertion about culture playing a part systematically, the burden of proof falls on you.

&gt; in your head, maybe. perhaps you're looking for it.

Because the title specifying Asian men is obviously in my head. Wow..

&gt; no one says it has to be the main factor to be a factor.

No, but that's how its being treated.

&gt; Is culture relevant when we discuss issues like forced marriage?

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; No, the point is that culture has little to do with it. 

you have failed to demonstrate this. 

&gt; Do we berate all men because of the disparity between male sex abusers and female ones?

we can legitimately ask why this is, without being sexist. though this has nothing to do with culture. 

&gt; Don't assume that I want us to ignore everything. What I'm saying is that it's wrong to assume that race or culture automatically played a part.

No one is assuming anything that doesn't immediately raise the question, simply as a consequence of the criminals and victims. 

&gt; Yes, but only because the Catholic Church has had a history of systematically hiding or down playing horrible things like child abuse,

ding ding, we have a winner. Please look into Islam, and the way women are treated in muslim countries, including Pakistan.

&gt; However, they should not assume that this was because they were priests.

maybe they should not, but some people would, and you could hardly blame them.  

&gt; Only because that anti-semetic attack has presumably been proven as such; where's the proof that culture is a systematic cause here?

it is the same proof present when a group of exclusively white males attacks a group of exclusively black males. 

&gt; Didn't say they were. What I did say was that four cases aren't enough to assume things.

no one is assuming anything. asking a question is not assuming? 

&gt; You're asking me to prove a negative, which is impossible.

it's not. ""there are no people in my garden"" is provable. 

&gt; the burden of proof falls on you.

make a claim, back it up. If you say culture didn't play a part, that is a claim.

I have never understood the epithet 'chav' to mean Chelsea fan. It's just lazy. Basically the equivalent of saying ""roland? haha that sounds like retard! Roland the retard! hahaha!!!"" it's puerile, playground stuff. grow up. 

now, let me quickly explain how your argument collapses on itself. 

1) Chelsea fans are called plastic for being glory hunters, which is a fair assessment of a lot of Chelsea fans. At least 1/2 of members of this sub are American

2) rafa benitez comes along, a manager of a rival club, who called Chelsea fans plastic and insulted us when he managed liverpool. 

3) Chelsea fans respond negatively, as is fair enough--it would be like Mourinho going to Barca or Moyes going to Everton

4) Chelsea fans are derided for not 'getting behind their manager' 

5) When Benitez starts to win (a few) matches, Chelsea fans reluctantly support him (although I think it's entirely possible to respect the manager and still not like the man)

6) most Chelsea fans completely forget our past with Rafa and decide that he's classy/a great guy/etc. They have literally proven to everyone that they are glory hunters. Rafa's 'success' brought about a complete 180 in their attitudes towards Rafa. That is the most plastic thing imaginable. 

7) the rest of us that realize that a few matches won and doing what was expected of him--the bare minimum, really (remember that Rafa could have won 5 trophies)--is not sufficient to change our attitude towards him. He is our manager, nothing else, I'm glad to see him go. 

8) so the fan is left in a dilemma, either a) 'get behind' Rafa and be the definition of a plastic, shit fan with no memory of the past or b) accept that Rafa has done well enough here but without loving him unconditionally and be derided as a bitter fan 

It's a lose-lose situation. No matter what, the community of fans (especially those liverpool cunts) will find a reason to hate Chelsea fans. We cannot win. Hence the bitterness.

The British passport is also useful in many other international destinations and will probably remain so even if we leave, the EU but its usefulness will be reduced.

The Argentinian police receive orders to round up Britons and put them in internment camps, and the British Embassy is closed down and the Ambassador and diplomatic staff arrested. (This is all background, humour me.)

As a British holidaymaker and EU citizen in Argentina, you can go to, say, to the Dutch embassy and say '*Help! I'm a EU citizen, get me out of here!*' - and they'll help you. Since joining the EU, suddenly there are hundreds and hundreds of places across hundreds of countries that treat you as one of their own, and render assistance if you need; for you are not just a British citizen, you're a European citizen, and you'll be accorded protection by our stately neighbours and allies.

TETZEL: 

Are you wondering who I am, or what I am? Is there anyone here among you, any small child, any cripple, or any sick idiot who hasn't heard of me, and doesn't know why I am here? No? Well, speak up then if there is? What, no one? Do you all know me then? Do you all know who I am? If it's true, it's very good, and just as it should be. Just as it should be, and no more than that! However, however just in case just in case, mind, there is one blind, maimed midget among you today who can't hear, I will open his ears and wash them out with sacred soap for him! And, as for the rest of you. I know I can rely on you all to listen patiently while I instruct him. Is that right? Can I go on? I'm asking you, is that right, can I go on? I say ""can I go on""? 

*(Pause)* 

Thank you. And what is there to tell this blind, maimed midget who's down there somewhere among you? No, don't look round for him, you'll only scare him and then he'll lose his one great chance, and it's not likely to come again, or if it does come, maybe it'll be too late. Well, what's the good news on this bright day? What's the in formation you want? It's this! Who is this friar with his red cross? Who sent him, and what's he here for? Don't try to work it out for yourself because I'm going to tell you now, this very minute. I am John Tetzel, Dominican, inquisitor, sub-commissioner to the Archbishop of Mainz, and what I bring you is indulgences. Indulgences made possible by the red blood of Jesus Christ, and the red cross you see standing up here behind me is the standard of those who carry them. Look at it! Go on, look at it! What else do you see hanging from the red cross? Well, what do they look like? Why, it's the arms of his holiness, because why? Because it's him who sent me here. Yes, my friend, the Pope himself has sent me with indulgences for you! Fine, you say, but what are indulgences? And what are they to me? What are indulgences? They're only the most precious and noble of Gods gifts to men, that's all they are! Before God, I tell you I wouldn't swap my privilege at this moment with that of St. Peter in Heaven because I've already saved more souls with my indulgences than he could ever have done with all his sermons. You think that's bragging, do you? Well, listen a little more carefully, my friend, because this concerns youl Just look at it this way. For every mortal sin you commit, the Church says that after confession and contrition, you've got to do penance either in this life or in purgatory for seven years. Seven years! Right? Are you with me? Good. Now then, how many mortal sins are committed by you by you in a single day? Just think for one moment: in one single day of your life. Do you know the answer? Oh, not so much as one a day. Very well then, how many in a month? How many in six months? How many in a year? And how many in a whole lifetime? Yes, you needn't shuffle your feet it doesn't bear thinking about, does it? You couldn't even add up all those years without a merchant's clerk to do it for you! Try and add up all the years of torment piling up! What about it? And isn't there anything you can do about this terrible situation you're in? Do you really want to know? Yes! There is something, and that some thing I have here with me now up here, letters, letters of indulgence. Hold up the letters so that everyone can see them. Is there anyone so small he can't see? Look at them, all properly sealed, an indulgence in every envelope, and one of them can be yours today, now, before it's too late! Come on, come up as close as you like, you won't squash me so easily. Take a good look. There isn't any one sin so big that one of these letters can't remit it. I challenge any one here, any member of this audience, to present me with a sin, anything, any kind of a sin, I don't care what it is, that I can't settle for him with one of these precious little envelopes. Why, if any one had ever offered violence to the blessed Virgin Mazy, Mother of God, if he'd only pay up as long as he paid up all he could he'd find himself forgiven. You think I'm exaggerating? You do, do you? Well, I'm authorized to go even further than that. Not only am I empowered to give you these letters of pardon for the sins you've already committed, I can give you pardon for those sins -you haven't even committed (pause . . . then slowly) but, which, however you intend to commit! But, you ask and it's a fair question but, you ask, why is our Holy Lord prepared to distribute such a rich grace to me? The answer, my friends, is all too simple. It's so that we can restore the ruined church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Rome! So that it won't have its equal any where in the world. This great church contains the bodies not only of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, but of a hundred thousand martyrs and no less than forty-six popes! To say nothing of the relics like St Veronica's handkerchief, the burning bush of Moses and the very rope with which Judas Iscariot hanged himself! But, alas, this fine old building is threatened with destruction, and all these things with it, if a sufficient restoration fund isn't raised, and raised soon. *(With passionate irony)* . . . Will anyone dare to say that the cause is not a good one? *(Pause.)* . . . Very well, and won't you, for as little as one quarter of a florin, my friend, buy yourself one of these letters, so that in the hour of death, the gate through which sinners enter the world of torment shall be closed against you, and the gate leading to the joy of paradise be flung open for you? And, remember this, these letters aren't just for the living but for the dead too. There can't be one amongst you who hasn't at least one dear one who has departed and to who knows what? Why, these letters are for them too. It isn't even necessary to repent. So don't hold back, come forward, think of your dear ones, think of yourselves! For twelve groats, or whatever it is we think you can afford, you can rescue your father from agony and yourself from certain disaster. And if you only have the coat on your back to call your own, then strip it off, strip it off now so that you too can obtain grace. For remember: As soon as your money rattles in the box and the cash bell rings, the soul flies out of purgatory and sings! So, come on then. Get your money out! What is it then, have your wits flown away with your faith? Listen then, soon, I shall take down the cross, shut the gates of heaven, and put out the brightness of this sun of grace that shines on you here today. 

*(He flings a large coin into the open strong box, where it rattles furiously.)*

The Lord our God reigns no longer. He has resigned all power to the Pope. In the name of the Father, and of the 
Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. 

*(The sound of coins clattering like rain into a great coffer as the light fades.)*

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Right, but the problem with that entire line of reasoning is that you relegate tax to an optional and almost charitable discretionary contribution. It becomes a PR exercise of how many sales they risk to lose vs how much tax they should pay (which they can fix to any number they want, really). This is not how tax is supposed to work, and it's also very arbitrary in penalising consumer facing companies with viable alternatives - Starbucks get hit but Google haven't even issued a meaningful press release.

I agree with all this, but with multinationals, national governments are relatively impotent.  Corporation tax _is_ effectively optional, and social pressure backed with social economic decision-making/boycott/embargo is the only chance anyone has of enforcing it.  There could arguably be a governmental response, but it would require sufficient political will, and either a willingness to take on the corporate world head on and refuse them access to markets if they didn't play ball (which might also make consumers angry unless it was clear to them why parasitical companies were unwelcome and they agreed), or to take a sufficiently international approach and tax corporate wealth rather than profits divvied up by proportion of business across the region, again backed with the potential penalty of denial of access to markets for the whole region.",0,1368704245,null,0,false,0,c9zup3c,t3_1edvrz,t1_c9zup3c,t1_c9zullb,null,1431139362,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The point is that there is no way to measure a lack of a human.

&gt; we do. 

Nonsense. When Saville's story came about no one focused on the fact that he was a man, because that would be prejudiced. Same applies here.

&gt; and of course it doesn't, nor does being a muslim mean you'll abuse someone automatically. that doesn't mean religion didn't contribute.

Where's the evidence that shows how sexual abuse cases were perpetrated by Muslim men with their religion as justification?

&gt; I didn't say it was all the same. You could start with Pakistan, or the Quran. How does Pakistan rank on womens rights? Or don't you want to bother looking?

By acknowledging the differences you're contradicting your own point. Call me crazy, but perhaps ""they"" are not two dimensional caricatures.

&gt; sure, EDL are not racist either, and the catholic abuse scandal had nothing to do with catholicism or the culture of the church.

Except we have documented evidence for that, but not for what you claim.

&gt; What a god-awful mess this country has got itself into over multiculturalism, and once again our fear of racism will lead to the betrayal of hundreds of young girls 

&gt; Leaders of the Pakistani Muslim community – essentially a Victorian society that has landed like Doctor Who’s Tardis on a liberal, permissive planet it despises –

&gt; The fact that the judge accepted Rashid’s defence shows what a god-awful mess this country has got itself into over multiculturalism.

You did;

&gt; It obviously has something to do with their community/background/culture, in the same way that the systematic abuse of children by catholic priests has something to do with the culture and background of celibacy and secrecy. 

And..

&gt; as you know, I'm not saying race is a factor, but culture and religion. But you can't just say ""it's not a cause because I said so and we only have 4 cases"". If it is a cause, it is a cause, and we should try to find out.

Asking the question is fine, but assuming that culture automatically played a part is not.

[Written question to the Commission from Morten Løkkegaard \(ALDE\)](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WQ&amp;reference=E-2012-011510&amp;language=EN):
&gt; In his Blenheim Palace speech on the UK and Europe of 21 September 2012, Mr Radek Sikorski, Foreign Minister of Poland, stated that ‘at the moment, Norway’s net contribution to the EU budget is actually higher, per capita, than Britain’s’. The same statement by the minister is quoted in *The Economist*.

&gt; Exactly the same argument has been presented by a Danish EU expert, but this claim was disputed shortly afterwards by the Danish public service radio station, Danmarks Radio (DR).

&gt; — Will the Commission please clarify whether it is true that the UK pays more per capita to the EU than Norway?

&gt; — In addition, the Commission is asked to provide precise figures for the following:

&gt; 1. 	Norway’s gross contribution to the EU;

&gt; 2. 	the UK’s gross contribution to the EU;

&gt; 3. 	Norway’s total net contribution to the EU and its net contribution per capita;

&gt; 4. 	the UK’s total net contribution to the EU and its net contribution per capita.

This got a response:

[Answer given by Mr Lewandowski on behalf of the Commission](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2012-011510&amp;language=EN)

&gt; The Commission does not publish any contributions per capita either for Member States or for EFTA countries. The contributions by the Member States to the EU budget are published every year in the financial report. The latest version of the financial report can be found under the following link:

&gt; http://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/2011/fin_report/fin_report_11_en.pdf

&gt; and detailed data per Member State for the period 2000-2011 at:

&gt; http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm

&gt; The available information on the United Kingdom's and Norway's total contributions to the EU budget is presented in the annex.

&gt; However, comparing contributions to and the receipts from the EU budget of the United Kingdom (or any other Member States) with Norway seems hardly relevant. Norway only contributes to a few specific programmes in which it participates. Consequently, its direct contribution to the EU budget is on a completely different scale compared to the United Kingdom's contribution.

While there is of course no direct answer given there, ""on a completely different scale"" does not sound like ""more"" to me...",0,1368705007,null,0,false,0,c9zutc2,t3_1ebfsr,t1_c9zutc2,t1_c9zr5nv,null,1431139306,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

From there head to the river through the lanes and go along the river (west) to the tate modern. Spend a lot of time there (its free).

Cross the fancy footbridge to St Pauls. If its the weekend, the City (the  financial district) is fairly quiet but I kind of like wandering round at the weekend as theres all sorts of things to stumble over. It all gets a bit 28 days later quiet some times.

For a night out, I've quite enjoyed soho or shoreditch

Sunday morning - when  i lived in Herts, we used to get up daft early and head in to Soho to Bar Italia for wake up juice. Its only closed 5am to 7am and the coffee is awesome. it hasnt changed much since 1949 its tiny and pretty cool

From there, wander to Covent Garden - and just wander about, you'll be entertained. 

My best tip is to do stuff early as possible if you can. Sometimes you can feel like youre waking up with the city and its yours. Its not really ever quiet, but it gets stupid busy every day and avoiding the worst of the crowds pays dividends.

I can't believe I'm having this conversation. are you telling me there is no way to prove that there are no people in my garden? how's this for a number; 0. 

&gt; Nonsense. When Saville's story came about no one focused on the fact that he was a man, because that would be prejudiced. Same applies here.

wtf. everyone knows he was a man, what's the point in mentioning it? the stories focused on the culture at the time and all the contributing factors. Just as we are doing here. 

&gt; Where's the evidence that shows how sexual abuse cases were perpetrated by Muslim men with their religion as justification?

you really need to adjust your subtlety meter. The question is not whether they consciously used religion as their motivation, but whether their religion played a part in framing and allowing them to commit their crimes. 

anyway, I guess you didn't read the article;

"" Adil Rashid, who had “raped” an underage girl, was spared a prison term after the judge heard that the naïve 18-year-old attended an Islamic faith school where he was taught that women are worthless. Rashid told psychologists he had no idea that having sex with a willing 13-year-old was against the law; besides, **his education had taught him to believe that “women are no more worthy than a lollipop that has been dropped on the ground”**.

&gt; By acknowledging the differences you're contradicting your own point. Call me crazy, but perhaps ""they"" are not two dimensional caricatures.

no one is proposing they are, so you are committing a strawman fallacy. 

&gt; Except we have documented evidence for that, but not for what you claim.

""his education had taught him to believe that “women are no more worthy than a lollipop that has been dropped on the ground”. - [source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10060570/Oxford-grooming-gang-We-will-regret-ignoring-Asian-thugs-who-target-white-girls.html). 

what documented evidence do you have that catholicism contributed to the abuse? 

&gt; What a god-awful mess this country has got itself into over multiculturalism

this is not a criticism of multiculturalism, it's a criticism of our countries dealing with it. 

&gt; Leaders of the Pakistani Muslim community – essentially a Victorian society that has landed like Doctor Who’s Tardis on a liberal, permissive planet it despises –

this is not a comment about multiculturalism.

&gt; The fact that the judge accepted Rashid’s defence shows what a god-awful mess this country has got itself into over multiculturalism.

likewise. 

&gt; You did;

ok I did, and I stand by it. culture played a part; otherwise we would have seen them targeting asian women.

Because men are significantly more likely to sexually assault someone than a woman, but him being a man wasn't brought up because it would make it an assumption that he did what he did due to being a man, which isn't true, as far as we know.

&gt; you really need to adjust your subtlety meter. The question is not whether they consciously used religion as their motivation, but whether their religion played a part in framing and allowing them to commit their crimes.

Yes. Where is the evidence that this is happening systematically?

&gt; "" Adil Rashid, who had “raped” an underage girl, was spared a prison term after the judge heard that the naïve 18-year-old attended an Islamic faith school where he was taught that women are worthless. Rashid told psychologists he had no idea that having sex with a willing 13-year-old was against the law; besides, his education had taught him to believe that “women are no more worthy than a lollipop that has been dropped on the ground”.

I did read the article, and no, this anecdote doesn't really prove anything.

&gt; no one is proposing they are, so you are committing a strawman fallacy.

How? You claimed that women being oppressed in Muslim countries contributed to this. When I mentioned that treatment varies, you conceded the point. You keep on going back on forth on what you're saying.


 
&gt; what documented evidence do you have that catholicism contributed to the abuse?

I was referencing the catholic church suppressing this information being leaked, and this went all the way up to the pope. That is certainly systematic and worthy of a review.

Ashford International to London Zones 1-6 is £5,404.00 ""normally"" or £6,360.00 on HS1, that’s a 17.7% increase, not 50%. 

Birmingham New Street to London Zones 1-6 is £9,980 on virgin at the moment. 117.7% of that is £11,746.46, which we can assume might be the HS2 cost.

Average house price in Birmingham is £158,743.
Average house price in Greater London is £445,651.

Making some very rough assumptions about mortgages (60% LTV, 4% APR, 15 years remaining) that makes the monthly repayments £704.52 and £1,977.86  respectively. That’s a difference of £1,273.34 a month, or £15,280.08 per annum. Which is enough to cover the cost of the season ticket. Even, if we assume that birmingham house prices rise, say, 20% on the back of the new connection it would be enough.

So it’s not unreasonable to say that the added cost of the season ticket for many people is outweighed by the cheaper cost of housing.

I have never said these issues are two dimensional; you are promoting a strawman. these are complex issues, but that does not remove the fact that women's rights in Islamic nations are far below western culture.

so the culture of catholicism had nothing to do with the actual abuse, correct?

&gt;The Department for Transport says phase one will cut London to Birmingham travel to 49 minutes, from the current one hour and 24 minutes.

35 Minutes is usually touted as an insubstantial time benefit. Still this is cutting more than a third of the journey time -- I would take that. Still the main benefit here is for the longer journeys that will utilise this line in stage 2 (if it ever gets built).

&gt;The HS2 phase two would virtually halve journey times between Birmingham and Manchester - to 41 minutes

This now becomes a sensible commute (time wise) to the benefit of both cities.

&gt; Between London and Manchester from two hours and eight minutes to one hour and eight minutes.

Again this would potentially be a daily commute (time wise) mainly benefiting the northern city.

&gt;Speeds of up to 250mph on HS2 would reduce a Birmingham to Leeds journey from two hours to 57 minutes.

Again this becomes viable as a common daily commute.

What isn't covered here is:

 * The Leeds -&gt; Sheffield route. The journey is around 30 miles but takes over an hour at the moment. On this line it 'should' be below half an hour, but I can't locate the details.

You cannot get so closely tied as a nation with something like the EU and expect leaving to have no ramifications. Most of the ""let's leave the EU!"" brigade assume that the only difference will be that we can close our borders to immigrants from Eastern Europe.

Well, that's true, but there is no way we'll be able to negotiate free trade treaties - or for that matter free movement of people between selected countries - that are anything like as good as what we've got right now. We don't have a lot of industry left, which means two things:

 - What little we do have needs protecting for our export sales. Exiting from agreements that allow free trade flies in the face of that. Manufacturing that depends on a lot of expensive plant and machinery or knowledge won't move overnight, but where you've got manufacturers who are headquartered outside the UK - well, maybe they won't invest so much into their UK factories when it costs more to export. It won't be immediate, but 10, 20 years down the line when the rest of Europe has had the benefit of investment that the UK hasn't - those factories are not going to look terribly efficient.
 - Imports have the same problem. Many products are manufactured with components from all over Europe; if there's tariffs appearing on some of those components, things become more expensive.

But the ramifications go deeper than this. Our ""special relationship"" with the US - well, a large chunk of that is because we're an EU member and we speak more-or-less the same language.

If we're not an EU member, suddenly that relationship is going to become a lot less special. Less special relationship and more friends with benefits - the US gets to screw us whenever they like.

I haven't even considered the impact on London. 

The way I see it, the government pays a huge amount for us to be in the EU and the country as a whole gets the benefits.

do you know what a human is? usually they are easy to spot. 

&gt;  The issue is that you can't measure what isn't there, so arguing that ""there are no humans in my garden"" is provable is simply not true, because you cannot measure absence.

You don't need to measure what isn't there, all you need is a definition and your 5 senses. sorry this is so complicated for you. 

&gt; Why cultural? The stats show that men are more likely to rape and so on, by quite a large margin, in fact. Following your logic we would need to assess whether him being a man contributed to this.

cultural because there was a very loose approach to sex and inappropriate touching in the 60s culture. Following that logic, we would look at the culture, not the gender.  

&gt; Great, we're back to the anecdotes. No, I need actual evidence. Four instances with zero controls for the data tell us fuck all.

the anecdotes of criminal convictions, sure. the words of the criminals, and of leaders in the community. ""la la la, I can't hear you!""

you're right, head in sand is a much more intelligent approach.

That isn't scientific. Your senses aren't a method and provide no evidence for a measurement for a lack of a human. How hard is this to understand?

&gt; cultural because there was a very loose approach to sex and inappropriate touching in the 60s culture. Following that logic, we would look at the culture, not the gender. 

You're not understanding my point. By your logic, a culture is apparently causing people to create sex abuse gangs. Statistically, men are more likely to rape than women; so your own logic would dictate that something should be done about men in general.

&gt; the anecdotes of criminal convictions, sure. the words of the criminals, and of leaders in the community. ""la la la, I can't hear you!""

nothing about it was automatic. 

&gt; Yep, because there are no measures in place to make this representative of the population at large. These crimes are grotesque, but not representative of the country.

no one is saying they are.

empirical judgements are around the corner.

factors, not automatically to blame. keep up.

so the answer to ""the culture of catholicism had nothing to do with the actual abuse, correct?"" would be yes. seriously, do you disagree?

I think for you to get a proper feel of what English tea is like, you need to get your hands on some of the real deal, in the form of tea bags of common brands such as Tetley, Yorkshire Tea, or PG Tips.

In my experience, tea anywhere outside of the British Isles has been piss weak. Even the breakfast tea's you get in hotels is pretty dire, and I find I have to leave the bag in the cup for eternity to get a decent cup out of it.

As for chocolate, yes I agree that the American incarnation of it is no where near as nice as ours. It's probably a taste thing, but I think it's down to the volume of fats and milk that is in ours (being higher). I would also doubt that the Cadbury's stuff you get is the same as ours as it would not sell much if it was as it would be so much different, but that's purely a guess on my part.

true,Bilgistic,eng-GreaterLondon,Civilisation,"&gt; could you answer with a yes/no please. are you telling me it's impossible to prove that there are no humans in my garden?

It's a little more complicated then that. You *can't* prove a lack of humans because there's no such thing as measuring a lack of a human.

Similarly, if someone is asserting that culture is the cause, then they need to prove it, and not demand that it be disproved.

Does that make any sense?

&gt; nothing about it was automatic.

So people just happened to automatically start discussing culture and religion as soon as it hit the papers?

&gt; no one is saying they are.

Er, what? *You* did;

&gt; the rape and abuse of hundreds of girls by muslim men tells us nothing about the situation at large. got it.


&gt; empirical judgements are around the corner.

I need research, not case rulings.

&gt; factors, not automatically to blame. keep up.

Which were only considered because they were Muslims. Keep up.

&gt; so the answer to ""the culture of catholicism had nothing to do with the actual abuse, correct?"" would be yes. seriously, do you disagree?

Yes. Being Catholic didn't automatically make them do those deeds.

&gt; You're the only one doing this, and attempting to show others are doing it.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"This. It just seems to me that it is a conflict of interest for an economic think tank to say that early retirement is good in any way. The abstract/summary highlights a trend that retirement age is reducing, whilst life expectancy and 'health life expectancy' have been increasing. It seems like the author has gone out of his way to disprove this trend. He somehow came to the opposite of the obvious conclusion.

He highlights that people are living longer and healthier lives and then goes on to claim that it has not been reflected in peoples' working lives (Because of his economic agenda, he wants to highlight as much as possible that people should be working longer). He never truly addresses the correlation between earlier retirement and longer, healthier lives, because citing studies that reinforce this would hurt his argument. 

He simply states that 'a plethora of studies,which display conflicting results, cannot seperate causality from correlation' (Followed by a list of papers which support the correlation, without giving them a second look or mention later in his paper). But his entire paper is based on the correlation of health compared with length time in retirement. His paper is heavily based on a paper that specifically looks at health compared to time in retirement (Found here: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2153191). This paper, in it's abstract, describes that ""While the short-term health impact of retirement in Europe remains uncertain, the medium- to long-term effects appear to be negative and economically large. "", so how he can use these results to justify increasing the retirement age when it very clearly states that short term impacts are uncertain? 'Uncertain' is not enough to undermine strong contradictory correlation, i'm sorry.

The long term impacts are driven by the fact that age effects people's health. The results he is using to justify his viewpoint assume a lot in regards to age and health, more specifically they claim to control for the age variable, but clearly they haven't controlled the variable enough. They need to do a similar comparison, but for people who stay in work long past the retirement age. You can't simply associate the deteriating health with retirement past age 65, if you don't have an equivalent sample of people who worked long past aged 65 to compare them with. In order to eliminate the age variable, they need to do an identical investigation for people in work long-term after the age of 65, because at the moment it seems like the reduced health from long term retirement can still be attributed to increase in age, not increased time in retirement.

In his Conclusions and policy implications, he again highlights that there has been a decline in labour participation amongst older people, despite the fact that life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased. He then goes on to highlight research that contradicts this correlation, whilst dismissing any research that supports it as either biased, or that it simply hasn't separated correlation from causation. This is a direct quote from his conclusion:

&gt;Research on whether retirement is bad for health has produced mixed results. However, this research may very well be biased because of its methods. Untangling cause and effect in the relationship between retirement and health is very difficult. This is especially true of earlier multi-country research. Of course, some studies have found negative effects of retirement on health. Indeed, this is the case of the most recent study using English data, which better deals with concerns raised in this paper than previous British research.

This research is a load of shit. He only praises research that supports his argument, and dismisses everything else without critically evaluating it. Think tanks are supposed to be impartial. This is not. The purpose of this research was to justify increasing the retirement age, and debunk claims that it could affect health. It succeeded on the former, but not the latter, though he does a good job of covering that part up.",0,1368713168,null,0,1368713664,0,c9zwmst,t3_1eg0ts,t1_c9zwmst,t1_c9zuyad,null,1431138450,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Isle of Wight is a bit more involved but manageable - train from Bournemouth station to Brockenhurst, then an hourly shuttle train from Brockenhurst to Lymington Pier, then WightLink ferry to Yarmouth.

Brits do not understand iced tea. But then, if you'd grown up drinking hot tea with milk in it, the thought of it iced does seem pretty weird.

You rarely find iced tea in a bottle here - I can remember seeing the Lipton stuff in the cooler at a Nero cafe, but that's it. You NEVER find 'normal' tea in a bottle or in any ordinary convenience form. The trolleys on trains have special hot water tanks so people can brew their own tea when they buy it. Also, the coffee here is rarely drip coffee as you know it. It is perfectly normal to drink only instant coffee. But our instant coffee is (or can be) extremely nice and there are many, many kinds you can buy. Some of them are incredibly posh and taste like Starbucks (in my heretical opinion.).

Tea doesn't come in bottles in the UK.  We buy teabags and make it ourselves.  We also drink usually it with milk in, not black.  Tetley British Blend, while not actually the same as the Tetley tea we have in the UK, is perfectly acceptable as an everyday tea.  Put the teabag in the cup, pour freshly boiled water over it, let it sit for a minute, stir, remove the teabag, and add milk to taste.

When my (American) boyfriend comes to visit me, he also comments on how little salt there is on our crisps (or chips, if you must).

""Pie"" in this country refers to a meat and possibly veg pie as default; we would specify apple pie, fruit pie, etc if it was a sweet pie.

KFC, while it has the same branding as in the US, is not really the same over here at all.

All the workings of a nation state.

However, there is an alternative view which is the UKIP position that we're not so similar and thus making laws together is impractical and practically impossible. And they do have some support for their argument because you can look at the wide variety of languages spoken throughout the EU and all the different political attitudes and you can find that they do vary considerably. A politician who gets elected in Italy or Greece would never stand a chance in Sweden or Germany, and visa versa. 

However, there is a counter argument to that too which is that we've already been making law together for 60 odd years and apart from the current Eurozone/sovereign debt crisis it's gone pretty smoothly (I'll remind people that no nation is immune to crisis.) I would also point to our shared attitudes to things like foreign policy which tend to favour economic coercion (like sanctions) or in the case of actual military conflict (which should be avoided at all costs) it should be conducted from the air and with little or no European troops on the ground. We also tend to adopt similar attitudes to freedom of speech, freedom of the individual, human rights, standards of life, standards of produce, the environment, education. 

The thing is, you can't decisively prove one way or the other. You can get evidence for your side of the argument, but it will always be anecdotal and never comprehensive. That's where the beauty of the UKIP argument on sovereinty is. ie, we should determine our own affairs because we're different from those other European countries and thereby can't share a country with *them* so to let them have parts of our sovereignty is foolish.

The idea that we've had no say in the EU is utterly ridiculous our elected representatives both at home and in the EU parliament have had a say and what they've largely said is ""yes this is good"" because that has been the political conscious at home driven by who *we* choose to elect us. The inaction to stop the changes is and always has been a consent to those changes, if you've only just woken up to what we've happily been agreeing to then I'd almost say it's childish of you to suddenly demand that you get to make up for not paying attention by being asked what you want.

Now I'm not questioning the idea that we need a public debate on our future in the EU, I have issues with some of the less democratic aspects and I'm sick of the only answer to that being ""leave"" instead of ""make it more democratic"". I'm in the long term in favour of a federal EU super state and I strongly believe that is what is best for the country.

Sadly however that's *not* the debate we are getting. Cameron wants to offer us no real choice. If he gets his way we either get his conservative, less federal version of the EU or we leave. If he doesn't get his way I've got no doubt his party, if not him directly, will use that to attack the EU as a whole and undermine any chance at a grown up debate about leaving. 

The right wing tories are capitalising on UKIP not to ""give the public a choice"" but to undermine the public's choice in our own permanently officials who have largely and consistently came to a overall pro EU conscious because the public is largely, and totally fairly, not as informed as those officials and that can be manipulated. You only have to look at the god awful mess that was the AV referendum to see what spin and party political interest can do to the public discourse in regards to a referendum.

So yes, I agree, that in the long term we as a nation need to decide what we want from the EU and that should be a much more complex and open question than ""in/out"" which is a stupid idea that makes a good sound bite. We should be able to set the long term goals and bounds we are happy with in the EU and that should include an honest and open debate about embracing and encouraging federalisation.

Which is another way of saying a referendum is not necessarily the best way of doing it and even that maybe the best way of doing may very well be the way we've been doing it all along, as part of choice in who we vote for to represent us and why. People who are anti EU tend to ignore this because it lets them pretend ""we never agreed to this"" when we largely and clearly *have* so far.       

Which is not to say I'm opposed to a referendum but I'm just utterly sick of this idea that it's the *only* way and somehow a response to this totally imaginary idea that the public has been powerless in all this.

It honestly feels like a lot of people are looking to excuse their own sloth and/or ignorance in this regard.

true,hotcod,null,null,"It's important to me we stay in the EU because I currently *want* a federal style EU superstate down the road. Which is not something that seemingly being even considered in public discourse at the moment. I feel people just find the idea somewhat unthinkable currently, which I understand, in the UK it's a incredibly radical idea but it's going to be *the* big defining point of EU politics in the next 50/100 years and I feel leaving will mean never being able to have the honest debate it needs and having no voice in something that is going to so fundamentally shape our neighbors.

I feel the EU needs to be more democratic than it currently is for any of that to work and I think pushing for that is the first step on the road to opening up people to the idea of federalism. Sadly ""it's not democratic"" only ever seems to be an excuse to leave rather than push for democratic reform. 

I also feel that anti EU people are kinda just waking up to the fact that the political, and as such the public consensus, has been largely EU. That people *have* had a say and that say has been *yes, fine* to the expansion in the EU. The 'rise' of UKIP shows that this system is working *as intended* and that if people want to change our place in the EU they should really first do so by voting for elected officials who will be able to change the informed political consensus on the EU that currently exist.

""but give the people a choice"" is almost a childish response in that regard. The people have had a voice, it's just not been yours thus far. This whole thing is largely the result of politicking by half of one party, a example of party politics leading the public debate rather than the other way around. Not that I'm opposed to having the debate I just don't think we've seem anywhere near enough political change reflecting any change *in* that debate to even start thinking about a referendum.

In short, I'll ask this one question;

**If the Liberal Democrats had formed a government with Labour do you think we'd have seen anywhere near this kind of debate?**

true,TheAmazingJoLuCo,null,null,"The training was learning a pitch, tagging along with more experienced sellers and then learning to keep up a routine by yourself. In my company, there was 4 levels with requirements. First level was cold caller, the basics of the job. 

Then there was Account Manager, where you start interviewing people for your team and tutor them the things you know. It's entirely up to you how you keep track of them but I basically had a book filled with all the people that left and all the people that stayed and what levels they were at etc. The requirements were gaining an 2 applications a day for a week, then you get promoted. 

Then there was assistant manager, where you learn how to run the company whilst everyone's out. I'm not sure what you did but I assume it's handling interviewee's, arranging them and taking over if the current manager is absent. The requirements were that you have 4 Account Managers on your team and that you earn £1200 a week from yourself and your team combined. 

Then there's Manager. Your current manager pays for a new place for you to set up your business whilst you take 5 of your best crew with you and you carry on from there. Requirements is simply having one of your crew reach assistant manager.

I was earning £600 a week commission average but I can't say I was happy. The hours are long, you only get sunday off, you have to work your butt off until you get to Manager where, if you chose to, you could sit on your arse all day and you'd get about £400 just from your starting team. It's a big morale game so it's encouraged to go out with your team, the sellers, and show them how the pro' does it. 

If you could change from introvert to Extrovert, I would have stayed and reaped the rewards but I'm not. It can be tough for people but if you stick it out, the money is there if you're committed to the idea of making serious money further down the line.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Are any of our youth ready to challenge for a top 4 side though?

No they would not be good enough for top 4, but they are good enough to play 3rd fiddle in a side aiming for top 4, which is what we need. The third striker shouldn't have to be 'top 4 quality' and for spurs it just isn't feasible to have three strikers of that calibre (you would need CL + strong league football to satisfy them. Only City/Chelsea/Utd are capable of that in England).

You would play striker 1+2 in the league and 2+3 in cup competitions. When fatigue becomes an issue the manager can chop and change depending on opposition to rest 1 and 2.

So for example, you could play Adebayor up top in the league on Saturday with Bony coming on in the 70th. And then on Thursday start Bony in the EL with Kane coming on in the 80th. Keeps all of the strikers fresh, gives the youth a look in and chance to prove themselves and both strikers are getting plenty of game time in a good competition.

&gt;And what would be your choices if we have CL? 

If we land CL football then we will want to replace our primary striker (shuffling Ade to 2nd) such that we are looking at New guy &gt; Ade &gt; Defoe/Youth. Granted Ade is currently our best striker we would be looking for someone that is better than him and affordable (already narrows the search). Players that have already been there should be first on the list, followed by players who bang them in regularly in their respective leagues. Dzeko, Higuain, Michu (arguable, but he has performed in Spain and now England), Stefan Kießling (never wants to leave his club) and El Shaarawy (loves his club) all come to mind as established players who could be gotten for ~£20m+.

I think we would have a pretty low chance of landing any of them unfortunately So using the CL as bait to snap up some brilliant prospects like Benteke and Eriksen would be in my plans.",0,1368715754,null,0,false,0,c9zxem4,t3_1edldv,t1_c9zxem4,t1_c9zwrje,null,1431138085,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Annual season ticket from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to London zones 1-6: £4,460, which is £7,286.40 per year cheaper than the assumed HS2 from Brum cost above. So net benefit of Aylesbury Vale over brum is £1870 per year.

But, that very much depends on you choosing Aylesbury Vale. If you choose somewhere like Hertfordshire (50 mins into Liverpool street from Hertford, Average house price £322,233, season ticket to London Zone 1-6 £3600), then the net benefit goes to brum by £560 a year.

We could do this exercise for different places until the cows come home. To properly analyse things we'd have to make a range of different assumptions and still only end up with a long list of hypotheticals.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"There are three very good reasons for announcing the name of someone who's been charged. 

1. Habeas Corpus - the alternative to naming people detained is NOT naming them, which allows for secret detention and people disappearing; being deported without due process etc. 

2. It encourages other victims to come forward, there is a huge problem with people not coming forward because of fear of not being believed. Many victims come forward only when another has made a formal accusation. 

3. It allows people who know of evidence for the accused's innocence to come forward. 

Justice must be done publically and must be seen to be done. That's a really important part of our democracy, I despair that people would do away with principles of English Law that go back to Magna Carta so flippantly.  

I think the onus should be on the media reporting and having the media make it clear that a charge or an arrest is NOT a conviction.  I don't think anonymity for charged people is a good idea, it would be an obstacle to open justice.  I can't support anything which would undermine habeas corpus.

&gt;It has come to my attention recently that British people find American chocolate to be tripe. I've heard it described as vomit

Exactly the same statement could be said by swapping 'British' for 'European' (as in the continent) and 'American' for 'British'. 

In fact, though I'm not 100% sure on the details, I believe there was a very long standing dispute between Britain and certain continental countries where they sought to have British (milk) chocolate labelled as 'chocolate substitute' or 'Vegalate' under EU law due to its vegetable oil content. This goes backs to the late 70s and was resolved in the early noughties, I think, when the EU said that British chocolate *could* be called chocolate.

As the relative scale of things goes, the order would be *Continental -&gt; British -&gt; American* in increasing order of shittiness and decreasing order of actual Cocoa use.

I find it hard to believe that someone is constantly assessing who and what's going on while having an agenda for a long term plan.

When bonobos have make up sex they don't know that they are having make up sex. When hotcod says people are sometimes more invested in what someone brings to a group rather than in that someone for their own sake he is not necessarily suggesting that they are aware of what  motivates them to act in a way that preserves the group. So there are no schemes, no conscious strategies; just behaviour. When a small male chimp grooms other male or female chimps he doesn't explicitly know that he does it to remain in good standing within the group, and for the most part nor do people know why they do the things that they do.

With Ecclestone it takes about 6 episodes until he clicks, for the first half it's mainly about introducing the audience to the idea of Doctor Who and time and space travel. Episode 6, Dalek, introduces The Doctors greatest enemy back into the show (Daleks are now a bit of a laughing stock, but that episode made me scared of them). It's also the episode where Christopher gets really into the role.

With Tennant, his first episode didn't have much of him except for the last ten minutes where he just instantly clicks into place as The Doctor. Tenants first series does have one of the worst episodes of the show ever made though, Fear Her, which was literally written at the last minute because of budget problems with the episode originally planned to be in its place. The rest of his series though is fantastic, including the series 3 episode Blink which was thought by many to be the best episode of New Who ever written (Written by the great Steven Moffat no less).

Then you get Matt Smith, when he came on the showrunner, Russell T Davies had left, and Steven Moffat had taken his place, the shows budget got better, it was made in HD, good CGI and absolutely stellar acting. Even if an episode with Smith isn't that good you'll enjoy it simply because he offer the best portrayal of The Doctor I have ever experienced, especially in the newest episode Nightmare In Silver, where he plays two versions of The Doctor. Like Tennant, Smith really came into the role in his first episode, Eleventh Hour, which ended with me completely forgetting how great David was.

With Bale moving full-time into a more central position, and with Gylfi and Clint never really playing in their preferred #10 spot, we need a bonafide winger on the side, if not to start, then as insurance for Lennon's hamstrings.

Townsend is that man. He'll be on the squad and in the team sheet all year next season.

One caveat: Would LOVE to see AVB make a run at Callum McManaman now that Wigan are going down. He's mighty impressive.

* Jonjo needs first team starts to shed that pressure.
* But he can't get first team starts because he crumbles under the pressure when given the opportunity.
* But he needs first team starts to release that pressure.

It certainly is interesting how players like Coutinho can seemingly waltz into the team shine while players like Jonjo - with seemingly all the talent in the world - struggle with the first team. I feel as if that's really the next huge jump that young players have to make: their mental toughness, confidence.

Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure where Jonjo will find the time to get consistent starts with the first team. In the midfield... will he start over Lucas? Henderson? Gerrard? Joe Allen? Countinho? Will he be deployed more forward over Suarez? Sturridge? Borini? Can he start over Downing or Sterling in the wide role? What happens if Rodgers/FSG bring in an attacking midfielder?

At this point, I wonder if Jonjo should be loaned out to a Premier League club this upcoming season to get those first team starts, get that confidence, and perhaps be an incredible force by the time we add the Champions League to our campaign in 2014/15.",0,1368718958,null,0,false,0,c9zyh7k,t3_1egbr2,t1_c9zyh7k,t1_c9zxlss,null,1431137580,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

You also get far more complex situations, sometimes a manufacturer on a high margin item will effectively loan stock to a reseller, to get that new business started.  Effectively if they make no profit, then the manufacturer charges next to nothing, however if they do make profit, the manufacturer charges more.  That on the outside could look like a complex system setup to make sure the retail end never turns a profit, but it is in fact a common way of starting businesses and growing sales.

Day, night, wet, dry, I knew it perfectly. Every single bump in the road. The schedules of the dog walkers and kids walking home from school. I had seen it all. Or so I thought.

This night. The night that shall haunt my dreams was different. The majority of the run went without a hitch, until the final dirt track leading to the rear of the station. My town is a valley, beautifully cut into the landscape by a river. From this track I can look to my left as I run peering over a low drystone wall to see the whole town. I look to see any signs of smoke, or fire, or other sirens, the telltale signs of why I am making my daily pilgrimage. As a looked over the picturesque town something unexpected happened. 

There was a screech of demonic evil. Direct from the bowells of Hell. My chest was hit with a thud, and a clawing. I fell to the ground, my skull barely missing the wall to my side. Another screech, as my vision cleared I saw it, scuttling away, back to its satanic lair,  its evil mission complete, delaying an emergency service response. The fucking badger.

Most European grids run at 230V and 50Hz and US grids run at 115V and 60Hz. The frequency is irrelevant here (it would be more important if you'd run an electric engine) but the voltage is indeed one thing you'd have to pay attention to if you want to heat something.

What's heating the metal is the power (P) which is given in Watt (W). You can calculate the power with voltage(U) times amperage (I). So 

P = U*I

House power grids are secured with 16A (A = ampere = the unit of I) so the maximum you can achieve is

115V*16A = 1840W.

In Europe, it's 230V*16A = 3680W

So a lot more.

Attention! The units might be called differently in your country. EE is not something that is as international as CS so that's what the units are called in Germany.

**Lloris

Walker - Vertonghen - Mertesaker - Gibbs 

Sandro - Dembele - Wilshere

Bale - Walcott - Cazorla**


Now, Wilshere is a god, he's so damn good, and his influence cannot be underestimated, so he takes the midfield spot for me.

Wingers, I went for Cazorla, only because he's played there oftentimes this season, and is better, objectively, than the much loved Azza Lezza. 


I suppose Bale and Walcott are very much interchangeable depending on preference for that Striker position, however I've placed Bale on the wing because I feel like he'd be more effective with more possession, no offence to Walcott of course!

Similarly, Walcott has the pace and (more-so recently, sadly), the composure to play up top, and has proved himself this season. Bale on the wing will have ample opportunity for long shots.

I'm not too interested in squads, as of now. I feel like we may have more cover, but our cover is of lesser quality than Arsenals. Pundits all have differing opinions, but I feel like our injuries, and the losses of Luka and Rafa last summer are AMPLE enough reason to say that we're doing well, especially considering the points tally up top, usually 70 is well enough for Champions League, but it's been a tight season.

My understanding is that the problem with vaccination is that it isn't 100% effective, and this is coupled with incomplete diagnostics (we can't distinguish a vaccinated cow from an infected one).

&gt;Bovine tuberculosis is a serious problem for UK farmers, deserving the highest standard of evidence-based management. The government's TB-control policy for England includes licensing farmers to cull badgers. As scientists with expertise in managing wildlife and wildlife diseases, we believe the complexities of TB transmission mean that licensed culling risks increasing cattle TB rather than reducing it.
&gt;
&gt;Even if such increases do not materialise, the government predicts only limited benefits, insufficient to offset the costs for either farmers or taxpayers. Unfortunately, the imminent pilot culls are too small and too short term to measure the impacts of licensed culling on cattle TB before a wider roll-out of the approach. The necessarily stringent licensing conditions mean that many TB-affected areas of England will remain ineligible for such culling. We are concerned that badger culling risks becoming a costly distraction from nationwide TB control.
&gt;
&gt;We recognise the importance of eradicating bovine TB and agree that this will require tackling the disease in badgers. Unfortunately, culling badgers as planned is very unlikely to contribute to TB eradication. We therefore urge the government to reconsider its strategy.

""The scientific case is as clear as it can be: this cull is not the answer to TB in cattle. The government is cherry-picking bits of data to support its case.""
&gt;
&gt;Another signatory, Lord Robert May, a former government chief scientist and president of the Royal Society, said: ""It is very clear to me that the government's policy does not make sense."" He added: ""I have no sympathy with the decision. They are transmuting evidence-based policy into policy-based evidence.""

* FACE - Saturdays 
* 02.31 - typically the FACE afterparty but often its own event these days it seems
* Seedy Sonics - what was a student led, kind of student rave night that's blown up in the last year, often around once a month, really popular big nights
* Shadow City - smaller nights, often one or two big name headliners + support, still often sold out (I had to bribe my way in at the weekend, was worth it)
* Break-Thru - D&amp;B nights, pretty regular, very good.

Those are the main ones I can remember for Rainbow, they're house-based at the very least, a deep house fan wouldn't struggle. The Rainbow is more like a complex rather than one club, it has a load of different sizes spaces that are open according to the night. There's other cool one-off stuff that happens there like Reggae City this weekend (was sick last year) so yeah Rainbow is sick.

Lab11 is a really nice club, have only actually been once for a D&amp;B night. Really nice space, just doesn't have the most big nights going there at the moment it seems, especially as there's basically always something at Rainbow on a Friday or Saturday.

The Hare &amp; Hounds (Kings Heath) and The Bull's Head (Moseley) both do nights as well, obviously they're pubs with rooms above so nights aren't as regular or huge but I've had great nights there with house line-ups.

I'm probably forgetting some enormous thing but its been a long day. In as far as comparison to London, its alright. London is so unique I find its hard to compare but there's almost always a good night every weekend here and a trip down to the capital is &lt;£20 return on Chiltern Rail.

Just seen that electro scene bit, not really sure. I know that most of the big names in jackin house are all Birmingham based and some are residents at Rainbow (Tom Shorterz helps head up 02.31 I believe, Lorenzo and Hannah Wants are fairly local) if you're into that sort of thing.

Anyway hope that helps give you an idea of the scene! Here's a couple of links to cool stuff that I'm going to in the near future to give you an idea:

Trade with europe would not cease, and it is our continued membership of an anti-London EU that is a threat to our services.

But this is beside the point, for the only question that actually matters is:

Will it be possible for britain to remain a sovereign nation when economic independence is undermined by caucused QMV decisions foisted upon us via the managed consensus of the ECB/EBU?

To quote Gladstone: “The finance of the country is intimately associated with the liberties of the country. It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired … It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison …That power can never be wrenched out of your hands… That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse – the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure – your main guarantee for purity – the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.”

Regarding caucused voting via the EBU:

“De jure incentives to take common position: This incentive is reinforced by the way the Commission’s ECB/EBA Regulations are currently drafted. For example:

• The ECB Regulation envisions the ECB acting as a coordinator of eurozone national supervisors, with the view for them to take a common position. The ECB has already dropped hints that it intends to actively discourage dissenting opinions amongst eurozone national supervisors.

• Through a eurozone caucus, some member states will indirectly boost their influence as their voting weight amongst eurozone countries is proportionally much greater than in the EU-27 (EU-28 with Croatia). This is particularly true of the larger eurozone member states.

• The safeguards proposed by the European Commission (see Section 5 below) leave the eurozone with the upper hand. Given that the 17 eurozone countries already constitute a simple majority, these countries would only need to seek the support of three ‘outs’ – whereas non-euro countries would need at least four countries.

De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.

Taken together, the EBA structure will therefore significantly shift the balance of power in favour of the eurozone, at the expense of the UK and other ‘outs’.”

We do not have an answer to that question yet, but unless Cameron plays a blinding hand the answer is; most likely not!

A nation is either:

    a broadly sovereign state within the EU (As Britain might hope to be by retaining sovereign powers-of-the purse in a post-convergence EU)

    a functioning part of a larger sovereign entity as the euro-core will become (As members of the post-convergence eurozone will become)

The only other alternative is being a dependent adjunct to a larger sovereign entity. A Sanjak, in short, much as Greece was and is again today.

Becoming an EU Sanjak is neither liberal nor democratic, so propose me a solution because otherwise we will be leaving…………

If the girl tries to break away, a gang member might threaten to behead her or firebomb her home.

true,IlliniQuant,null,null,"Whoa, let's pump the brakes here a little.  I'm not particularly angry at Rafa or the board for appointing him anymore, since he's leaving soon, but I think people here are severely overrating his accomplishments.  He basically has accomplished the absolute minimum that should be expected from a Chelsea manager, plus an unexpected bonus in winning the Europa League.  These things need to be put in perspective.

On Europa League: While it's quite nice and unexpected to finish the year with silverware, let's not forgot that the road to winning it was easier than what one has to usually overcome to win the Capital One Cup. To win it, we had to beat teams from the 17th, 18th, 8th, 13th and 5th rated leagues in Europe by UEFA Coefficient.  By comparison, for a team to win the Capital One Cup, they usually have to beat at least 1 PL team (ranked second by UEFA Coefficient), and a couple of Championship teams (unranked by UEFA, but is generally seen as hanging out near the bottom of top-10 league in Europe).  I mean, fair play, winning any Cup is an accomplishment, but lets be very clear, EVERY team we beat along the way we should be expecting to beat handily.

On Top 4 Finish: I simply don't understand since when that is considered a notable accomplishment at Chelsea, rather than a given.  Carlo Ancelotti was fired for finishing second. We only finished once outside of the top 4 in the last 10 years, during last year's weird weird campaign.

On Fernando Torres' form under Rafa:  Yes, he does look livelier under Rafa.  However let's not forget that his form in the EPL remains dreadful. He has scored 3 league goals under Rafa - 2 against Sunderland and 1 against Aston Villa, two bottom of the table teams.  The rest came against minnows in various cups. Rafa did not turn Torres into a dangerous or even a good striker - just not a completely useless one. If anything, Torres' league form was better under DiMatteo, where he scored more goals in less games.

On David Luiz as a DM: Many people disagree with me but taking David Luiz and moving him to DM is taking a fantastic defender and turning him into an average midfielder.  Yes, he passes and shoots well (though inconsistently), but those are things he can do just as well while playing defense. OTOH, his positioning in midfield is pretty bad.  He gets completely overrun by competent midfielders (as happened against Tottenham and Benfica).  This is a bit important because positioning is the most important skill for a player in that position to have.  In defense (where he drastically reduced his mistakes this year and elevated his game to world class), positioning is a lot less important as you have to be a lot less aware of what's going on 360 degrees around you - you can just focus on what's in front of you.  I really hope that the next manager will move David back to defense, where he is our best player, and will just buy a good midfielder.

On whether DiMatteo would have done worse: This seems to be the prevalent line of thought around here, and I see no support for it.  By my napkin math, DiMatteo got us 24 points from 12 games, which is a higher points per game amount than Rafa's 48 from 25.  I'm too lazy to calculate this right now, but my gut feeling is that Robbie also has a better record than Rafa when looking just at common opponents.

On Rafa's tactical/managerial acumen:  Yossi Benayoun begs to differ.

Then there's the dire performance in CWC and COC and what it seems to me is that the extend of Rafa's accomplishments could be summed up with the words ""well, it could have been worse"".  It certainly could have been, but it would have taken one of the most inept managerial performances in CFC's recent history for that to happen.

So really, my feeling as I'm getting ready to say goodbye to Rafa is a reluctant ""good job, you didn't totally screw it up"".

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Then it draws into question why they would commission somebody who's professional opinion, driven by his own research on the subject, is that of earlier retirement negatively affects health. 

If that's what happened. It could be that they commissioned a generic leading researcher, who happened to believe this based on their own research. We I've been engaged by third parties, to be brutal they have had next to no interest in my previous research, they only go on my ability and reputation. 

&gt; The media will say it came from an impartial, independant *[sic.]* think tank 

I know nothing of the think tank, and am not prepared to proffer an opinion of their impartiality. If they do have an agenda, it should be very clear from their past publications.

&gt; Despite their status as independant from any political party, one should not underestimate the impact these reports can have on government policy.

At least this does have some academic underpinning. It's not like they are just quoting figures from UKTV Gold or the Sea Cadets. 

&gt; therefore the conclusion must be the only conclusion 

Well, that depends on the quality of the research. If it's high quality, I don't see why one would provide that much attention to other, inferior analyses just because they exist. To take an extreme example, there are some people who don't believe in anthropomorphic global warming, but I'm not sure quoting Delingpole would really add much to a scientific report.The fact that they have even acknowledged their existence in the report to me demonstrates a degree of intellectual honesty. 

&gt; The purpose of the report is very clear, to support the increase in the retirement age. That is not what research is about...

That's the conclusion of the research, and the point of research is ultimately to provide impact and affect public policy. The academic is only doing what he is meant to.

The worst of these was probably Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks and even that I found rather entertaining.

But really... The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang... The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon... Bad Wolf/The Parting of Ways... Army of Ghosts/Doomsday... and those where a stand-alone episode leads directly to the next story that is a multi-parter like Utopia -&gt; The Sound of Drums/The Last of the Time Lords...

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I'm not sure i would rank Chelsea as ""far"" better either.

Striker - Torres/Ba - Torrese notched 20 goals this season and Ba has been effective but neither are really an Elite striker at the moment. Ade/JD and Giroud/Podolski are comparable. Maybe give the edge to Chelsea but not by much. 

Midfield -Mata/Hazard/Oscar - fair enough they have been fantastic.  Fat Frank has played well all season in the twilight of his career, and give Rafa credit that Luiz has looked much better as a holding mid than a central defender.  But Mikel, Ramires and the rest haven't been anything special.  I would match Bale, Dembele, Sandro and Lennon and be more than happy, throw in Holtby, Gylfi, Dempsey, Parker and Thudd and i actually think from a holistic view Spurs are dead even with their midfield.  Carzola, a healthy Wilshire, Walcott, Arteta and Ramsey are right there as well.  I guess you could give the nod to Chelsea but it wouldn't be by much.

Defense- Cole (i fucking hate the twat) is better than either Spurs or Arsenal can put against. Ivanovic has been fantastic. Cahill has his ups and downs and Azpulaq has been better now that he is settling. With the exception of Verts i would say they have edge on Spurs. same goes for Arsenal minus Kols.  I would give the edge to Chelsea and it would be a bit more than the others.

Goalie - Cech...well, he is still pretty fucking impressive.  I would take Hugo but i would almost put it as a push with Spurs and Chelsea.  Arsenal behind both.

So at the moment i think we are all pretty close, wondering what happens when the James Bond Villan brings in Mou...does he crack open the piggy bank and completely stock up the team again. Because CL or not for both Arsenal and Spurs i don't see either team splashing Chelsea types of cash in the summer.

&gt; said he's the best English midfielder in the game right now and he's certainly top 4 quality

Not English, he's Scottish, but plays for Ireland. Also I don't get the hype around him. He's a good  young player, but I don't see how he would be an improvement over what we already have. We need another DM, not another box to box CM.

&gt;  potential cheap **upgrade** on Downing imo

Gonna have to disagree with you there as well. He's talented but far too inconsistent and wouldn't be an improvement over Downing IMO. For christ sakes, he just scored his 1st PL goal less than a month ago. You would think some LFC fans would learn what happens when you buy a young player, who has good run of form for a couple months, after the Henderson and Carroll situations.

I would rather have Ince over McManaman, but they both still need another season to prove their consistency IMO. I would much rather buy someone with more experience. We don't need any more young, promising players that might come good in 2 or 3 years.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/playlist/

Basically the lists decide how often something is played, with a ratio of 3:2:1. A B list song is played about 1/2 as often as an A list and a C list is played about 1/2 as often as a B list. There are also the other categories ""big things"" are songs that DJs play in every show (so basically get the same treatment as the A list) and the introducing songs are played ~2ce per day. The INMWT stuff gets put in when someone has time to fill.

Right now the selection in the A list is actually not **too** bad. The B list is pretty terrible music, and the C list is full of music that either shouldn't be on Radio 1 because it's good, or shouldn't be on radio 1 because it's so bad.

This week they had 8 new songs (click the new tab). 

The problem with Radio 1 is this playlist though. It's decided by ~20 ""experts"" ranging from Radio 1 presenters, to producers, to bloggers, to Music ANR people. It's a self-contained circle that only lets in music that they already think is good. It's amazing the people they let in there though - obviously out of touch with their target audience (since most people, even the ones who listen to it) can't stand Radio 1

On top of that they have some of the biggest names in music working at the station and their opinion is apparently ignored. All the DJs think that Zane Lowe is a music God, so the majority of non-pop music comes from his music taste, even though he's pretty open about the fact that he doesn't play music that he doesn't personally like. He's got decent taste in music and is passionate about it, but he's also just a man with an opinion.  Annie Mac is a huge powerhouse in the EDM world, and is mainly ignored by the other presenters, as is Pete Tong, Benga and Skream...

All the best shows are presented by people waaay in their 30s or even 40s, and R1 is stuck in this ""**CANT HAVE OLD PEOPLE ON RADIO 1!**"". Here's a hint, they're in music at that age because they know what they're talking about damnit. 

The other problem with R1 is that most of the daytime presenters just aren't entertaining, but think they are.",0,1368732203,null,0,false,0,ca03e02,t3_1efxal,t1_ca03e02,t1_ca01ja9,null,1431135195,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

Chocolate in the USA, regardless of manufacturer, tastes like cheap own-brand supermarket chocolate int he UK. Or ""cooking"" chocolate. It's not very sweet and has a funky aftertaste.

As for bottled tea... In the US, tea is primarily cold, thats why it being bottled is a thing. We don't typically drink tea cold in the UK. We do have iced tea bottled, but it's not a big thing. I fucking LOVE ""sweet tea"" in the USA... For my fellow Brits, in the southern US, they drink a lot of iced tea with a tonne of sugar in it. It's not the same as bottled iced tea you might know from home - give it a try. It's typically brewed fresh at every restaurant and will vary. They have special machines like coffee machines just for making sweet tea.

With UK tea, you always make it fresh, with a teabag and wait for the kettle to boil... (they boil faster if you leave the room, dont you know). Most people have it with milk and sometimes sugar. Most American's do not own a kettle... Oh, and most American's also do not own a grill (that's a toaster oven to you yanks). Almost everyone in the UK has one, we use it to cook bacon (bacons different in the UK... by different I mean better. American bacon is known as ""streaky bacon"" in the UK). and cheese on toast. Cheese on toast is a big fucking deal in the UK. Most American's have a coffee maker and instant coffee is preeeetty alien out there and looked down upon, but in the UK it's more common than real coffee in the home. Also, cucumbers in the US... You guys literally have a species called ""English Cucumber"" and it's the only thing that you call ""English"" that actually is what we use. That other gross larger American species with the prickles and big pips can go away.

In the UK, we call cookies ""biscuites."" Biscuites are often dipped in milky tea. We reserve the term ""cookies"" to mean biscuites with chocolate chips or soft biscuites. For example, we have a brand called Maryland Cookies, similar to chips ahoy, but they are a type of biscuit. Our biscuites are all infinitely better than anything in the US and I have NEVER met an American who does not agree. If you're an American reading this, you need to find imported McVities Chocolate Digestives (I've seen them in some supermarkets out there, in the imported sections), make yourself a hot tea with milk, and dunk. Life will never be the same again.

American food is, mostly, infinitely better than British food... But you fall SOOO short with sweet snacks, like candy, chocolate and cookies. Some of my favourite American foods that are hard to find in the UK or are simply not good enough are; red velvet cake, pulled pork, boneless wings, beer cheese dip, ranch, mountain dew, butterfingers, coconut cream pie, chex mix, dill pickle lays. Sure there's tonnes more. :)

These rights are all underpinned by the ECHR. And while every single person's rights are not under constant attack, it's important to have something to safeguard people's rights from the Government.

Without something entrenched like the ECHR, our rights would be subject to the complete whim of Parliament. That's what the term 'Parliamentary Sovereignty' means. And maybe it's just me, but I tend to like my fundamental rights to life, free speech and religion.

Now if we were to have a massive overhaul of our legal system to put in place something like a binding constitution or bill of rights, then that'd be fine. But we haven't. And given the party name, I can't see the conservatives being the ones to bind future Parliaments' hands.

Sorry British is what I meant to say. I actually think he's incredibly under hyped, he's that good. As much as Hendo has come on this year he's got more potential, for me, than him. He can play DM, he's certainly not a box-to-box midfielder so I'm not sure how much of him you could have watched. He'd play the 'new' Gerrard role in the new system, a good replacement for the future imo.

I said *potential* upgrade for a reason. He's got bags of potential to be a great winger and might be worth a gamble if he's going cheap. There's a reason the other top clubs are looking at him. Sure we need to learn from past mistakes but comparing this to Carroll is just lunacy. I'm not saying we shell out 35 million for him! Hendo is looking more and more like a good but overpriced purchase so I don't get the relevance there. **IF** he's going for a reasonable price, I personally think he's shown enough this season to get himself in the conversation. If we follow your philosophy of waiting until their fully proven we miss out because someone else has already snapped them up. He's an 'at the right price' kind of player for me, as is Ince.

I've actually watched him and Wigan quite a bit this season and I've never been really impressed with him. Like I said, he's a good player, but I don't think he's an improvement over what we have. Also I meant a true DM, for cover for Lucas. Between him and McCarthur, McCarthy is the more attacking of the 2 sitting mids, so he wouldn't cover that need for me. We already have Allen, Henderson, and potentially Shelvey who can play Gerrard's role and IMO McCarthy shouldn't take priority over our other needs this summer.

Price wasn't really what I was comparing, moreso the hype surrounding a young playing coming a good run of form and the amount of time it takes for them to gain consistency in their game.

 If he's bought for depth I wouldn't be too upset, but I thought you he meant he could potentially be our starting LW next season. If Downing is sold, which is looking somewhat likely, then I'd like for us to add another experienced player instead of McManaman.

I'd take McManaman, but as a luxury signing; he's the opposite of Downing. Stu is rarely spectacular, but (for most of his career, anyway) is reliable, works hard and you know what you're getting.

But that doesn't mean I can't objectively say that their tax operation (together with a number of other multinations) isn't exploitative. It isn't illegal either... but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing everything we can with other nations to bring them into line.

If you follow the news, that is in effect what the government are trying to do.

This is to me the crux of the issue... a stranger from space looking at Amazon EU SARL and Amazon UK on paper would see the UK operation as a small barely profitable goods re-seller with a minimal UK presence... of course in reality it turns out they're the largest web retailer in the UK with a vast UK operation.
