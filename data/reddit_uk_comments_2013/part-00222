Granted this is part of the (famous) [Sydney Fish Market](http://www.weekendnotes.com/im/002/06/sfmliveseafood21.JPG) but the supermarkets are fairly competitive in terms of range and price anyway, most shopping centres will have a ""mini"" fish market like this in them.

Maybe it's the fact that the English (sorry, I don't know the Scotts or Welsh that well), don't much go for ""icky"" bits like bones or heads. I see loads of smoked fish and kippers, but not much else.

One thing I do love about the fish here is the cheap Atlantic salmon. My kids can't get enough of it.

I loved HE at school, mostly because I was already cooking for my family by the time I did it, so it was easy for me. I wonder if it would be frowned upon doing deep fried classes in a Scottish HE class? You know, perpetuating the deep-fried Scottish food stereotypes?

true,notbeforelong,null,null,"This is one of the things I miss about the old city. Derbies were the highlights of any season, made sweeter if we won. That's why Hughes (If I remember correctly) was lauded for winning both derbies in the season a few years back. 

That being said, you brought up a good point about how we should have a more forward-thinking mentality and that our rivals should now be those placed around us. I also feel that united will always be our rivals. Its the same as how united have Liverpool and us as their rivals. Both our clubs are situated in the same city and we will always be rivals just because of the fans. MAYBE not title rivals, but still proximity rivals (if there is such a term). Plus we're only 8 games in and the season is a long one. We might even meet them in the champions league final!

The rivalry with united is the same as the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, Spurs and Arsenal, and eventually, the New York Red Bulls and NYFC. This rivalry has been around since both clubs were formed. At certain points in history, we were the shitty ones and they were good. Other times, we were the good ones and they were crap. Just because united are shit(ier) than us now doesn't mean our players do not care about their results.

 Many live next to each other and most are friends. One thing both sides share is the determination to be better than their neighbour. That's why players playing in Manchester derbies always give it that extra push. Its for the bragging rights towards each other, but more importantly, for the fans. Even though I do not live in Manchester, I'm sure if united finished below us, no matter the position, our fans would be able to hold their head high wherever they go in the city. Our fans would still be happy even though we might not have won the league. 

What we have now is a club at the edge of greatness. We should never take this for granted or get arrogant. Onee of the things I hate about united supporters is that they are arrogant and they took Ferguson's reign for granted. Now that he's gone and united are in a transition phase, many of them are lost. Many united supporters in their twenties and thirties do not know what its like to be shit. Many united supporters around the world would stop supporting united because they stopped winning. I don't want that to happen with this club. Supporting city has taught me something, always stay humble, and anything can happen. Plus I learned to see the silver lining in every cloud. 

I just hope none of us forgets where we came from. None of us forgets how its like to be shit. 

Sorry for the rant but your post provoked my inner passion. I'm not saying that your view is wrong, I'm saying that even though we should consider teams around us in the league as our rivals, we shouldn't forget that united are our rivals too and their results do motivate the players. Plus united just won the previous season and our players may be still riled up by that.

I was in an emotionally abusive marriage and so i feel as if i have some experience in this sort of thing, and in my opinion. report her and do it now !

i understand that you may feel as if this is not the right thing to do and i can tell you this is absolutely not the case. You may or may not know but she is still exerting control over you, still threatening you and will continue to do so unless you act. I guarantee you this will not stop after the divorce.

Lets imagine for one second that she does go public with her claims of sexual assault ? your file will be dragged through the gutter press and you will be tried by media.

this may well be a pattern of behavior for her she will do this again to someone else.

finally get it all written down and documented, pics and everything, go get your free 30 mins with a lawyer or citizens advice then take it to the police.

That was the point he was covering in the article.  We have not recovered.  But we have started to head in that direction.  Why did un-employment surge?  In the private sector it was as business declined, in the public sector it was as government reduced spending? (however the government didn't reduce spending inline with the reduction in tax receipts, hence the comment about austerity.).

The article mentions the housing market is stable for more people than it was during the crunch.  That is both a good thing and a bad thing, people who own a home are less likely to be stressed about loosing it, may well feel like spending more money.  At the same time it is symptomatic of a lower quality of life for many.

&gt; We're a glorified tax haven, with the London property market as the deposit account of choice for foreign tax evaders.

Which means stamp duty, council tax and unless they are qualified under a remittance basis, capital gains tax too.  There are far more attractive places for buying property with less tax implications.  I would question the effect this has on the national economy as anything more than negligible.

&gt;This isn't a recovery: it's a corpse twitching due to the febrile activity of the maggots dining on it.

Colourful metaphors aside, the point of the article is, that this recovery no one really has any credibility to say what has helped solve it or not.  Traditional Keynesians haven't had much investment spending, those who argue for austerity haven't seen it.

Edit: If wages keep up with CPI then the current average wage of £26k will increase to just over £58k, personally I don't see this happening.

To be comparable wages will have to go up by CPI to 2023 to get our starting year wage.

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"This is not a very well written article. 

There is no proposal to ban the transfer of personal data to 'US corporations'. This is a proposal to tighten the [already stringent rules](http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/principle_8) on transferring personal data from within the EU to the US. This does not affect US companies which are also based in Europe, like Amazon or Microsoft.

This is a proposal to require US-based companies offering data services in the EU to seek prior approval. This is not very different to the current situation. Almost all US-based companies offering data services in the EU are members of [Safe Harbour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles).  This is an EU approved scheme that allows the transfer of personal data to US recipients on the same basis as a transfer within the EU. In this sense, they have already sought approval and operate to EU data protection standards.

It's also worth noting that this is extremely unlikely to be the final version of the law. There have been huge numbers of drafts, consultations and negotiations. There's very little prospect of this being decided soon, or the final version bearing much resemblance to the current version. 

Also, it's a real stretch to describe this as a reaction to Snowden. As his revelations continue, it's increasingly obvious that US (and UK) intelligence agencies have no problem accessing data outwith their own borders. These proposals would also not restrict the transfer of data to the UK, where it could easily be accessed by GCHQ and then passed on.

 He always works his ass off, but in the ""Big"" games i would prefer that we have someone who can bring more to the game defensively and in attack.  Like i said, Siggy is more of a specialist, and there is definitely a use for him in the lineup but when i look at us matching up against the teams in the ""big"" games unless we have Rose back all of them will be able to isolate and neutralize Siggy's impact.  Even with Rose there will be teams that can isolate and neutralize Siggy because he isn't as versatile as some of the other players and his game is more reliant on the performance of his teammates.  If you have a team that can quiet Eriksen/Holtby in the middle or Rose on the left then Siggy's effectiveness drops quite a bit as he isn't likely to create a situation for his own shot or create a pass for a teammate against a quality defender(s).

So my personal thought it that internet access is definitely a *civil right*. By itself, access to the internet is an enhancement to life, instead of something that is definitively needed to live a fulfilling one, by classifying it as a *human right*, you then open all kinds of doors regarding criminal access, coded messages, etc.

We don't *need* internet access to live our lives, but they are enriched to varying degrees by having it, in the same way that my life is enriched by having access to a library, or a car.

I think the issue is that even if you separate deposit banks from investment ones, that one large investment bank going titsup is too much for confidence in the markets to handle.

Regulations have been introduced, firms went nuts a while back for implementing proper CVA however those models still lack the concept of implied correlation, mostly because no one can figure it out.  (If you could there are many products you could trade, such as outperformance options, and make a fortune).

What it comes down to is people start to be cautious, then they stop investing, which makes other people act more cautious and so on.  It is very difficult to solve that problem, because most solutions require liquidity of funding, which is not possible when that situation is happening.

It is also the way the public behave, people were quite happy gorging themselves on consumer credit, spending money they didn't have.  Then they get worried, stop spending which in turn hurts sales.... etc.  The trick is to not get yourself into that situation in the first place.

Sadly, the lessons of that appear to not have been learnt, we are doing a very similar strategy (all be it under different circumstances) to the original Greenspan puts, which was in no small part responsible for those people seeking to put money in places that could offer a return.

In the UK, my personal fear is that the housing bubble is in fact sustainable.  The problem is people don't look at the effect that has on the younger generation.  They are effectively being handed a multiwhammy of debt.  Debt for school, debt for parents/older peoples pensions, all those public sector people on immense pensions, PFI schemes so we can have our new school/hospital/PowerPlant today.  That is before we see certain inelastic commodities rise in price due to the global population increasing whilst many become removed from poverty.  My parents never had to outbid a Vietnamese farmer for some petrol.

This is going to create a generation of people who will end up with a much lower quality of life.  But sadly, many people are inherently selfish, and don't wish to take any pain today when it can be paid off (with interest) tomorrow.

Sadly, I think governments of all parties have a vested interest in making it sound as if it was entirely a banking problem.  They don't want to loose the effect of cheap consumer credit on the economy, they definitely don't want to loose the ability to fund a brand new Nuclear Power Plant by such off-balance-sheet means.",0,1382443287,null,0,false,0,ccx14jt,t3_1oyqf6,t1_ccx14jt,t1_ccx0vba,null,1429028579,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

i'm not in a position to provide legal, dependable advice, but this is what i would do:

1. call the police. not 999, use the non-emergency number (which i don't know from memory!) and explain the situation. i would expect them to be interested in this, especially as you are able to identify the person who committed the crime.

2. call THREE and explain the situation in full, including the fact that it is now a police matter.  They should also have a team that deals with this sort of situation. They may be suspicious because you previously paid off some bills, but the point is you were/are relatively young and naive and paid the demands before because you were scared.  You also need to explain to them that as this is not your debt you will not be making any further payments, so they need to start chasing the right person, and more importantly stop him racking up any more costs in your name. 

Good luck with this, and please don't let this get to you too much.  it is a shitty situation and it will be challenging to sort it out, but you aren't the first person this has happened to, and won't be the last. others have got through it and so will you.",0,1382444464,null,0,false,0,ccx1ccv,t3_1oyrrb,t1_ccx1ccv,t3_1oyrrb,null,1429028478,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

As it is they move in, cause problems for residents which means they get moved on and feel marginalised and rejected and are so perhaps less likely to respect the next group of residents they set up by.

Your best bet it to join an official supporters group in Australia.  Then, register for a True Blue membership for 2014 (you'll only be able to do it after the end of this season). You must register before July 31st,  2014 to get the early bonus loyalty points. THAT LAST POINT IS VERY IMPORTANT - YOU'LL NEED THESE POINTS. Then, follow your supporters group procedure for getting tickets. 

Something to keep in mind is that the schedule for next season won't come out until June 2014. Also keep in mind there's an international break in August - you'll need to plan around that.

true,guernican,null,null,"I'm surprised that the charity stuff is offensive. FYI there are over 300k charities in the UK alone, and they're all fighting for the same money. I tend to think that expensive television advertising is a strange thing for charities to do, but for some - the really big ones are the cancer charities, MacMillan and CRUK - it makes financial sense. For older people - and, statistically, they're the largest contributors to charities - I suppose it's possible for them to be exploited, but I'd guess unscrupulous sales techniques like cold-calling would be more exploitative. And if charities are caught using those sorts of techniques, the negative publicity would be huge.  

The stuff for online gambling: well, that's a question of legislation. Our government seems to be happy for it to be there. Gambling is (generally) illegal in the US, for example, but here we have a long history of it. Personally, I've never understood the appeal of that sort of gambling and I tend to have minimal sympathy for people who become addicted. If nothing else, it proves you should have paid attention when you were studying mathematics. 

Easy loans, selling gold and so on... I'd recommend you look into the debates about this that are happening in government. The MP Stella Creasey, in particular, has been campaigning against them. They're a sign of the times, and sadly some people do use them to subsist on, but obviously there aren't many right-thinking people that approve of them. 

But I think the primary issue with advertising is one that you don't really touch on... above and beyond what happens on television, the general ubiquity of commercial communications is an insidious thing. As the father of a young daughter, I naturally have concerns about how women are represented in advertising (for example). We see hundreds of messages a day, and - whether you believe it or not - there's a cumulative effect in having a message persistently echoed and redelivered in your brain. It's nothing so vulgar as ""Go and buy this!"" resulting in you walking numbly into Dixons... it's much more what we call ""time spent with brand"", where you are gradually brought round to a way of thinking about a brand by the tone and message of its communications. Think about how Google, or Apple, or Nike present themselves. These impressions colour your perception of a company and influence, however subtly, how you feel about them and whether you're amenable to owning them. 

When I go to, say, a dinner party and I'm asked what I do, I do occasionally get the impression that people think that advertising agencies are these frighteningly cunning organisations with subtle mental manipulators pressing buttons in our cortexes. The truth is nothing like as sophisticated, but no less worrying if you're a conscious animal. It's about repetition, and massaging of reputation and personality, to make you feel positive about a certain company. We can't change your mind - if you don't like Mercedes, you just don't - but we can reinforce prejudices or pander to possibilities.

true,Fairwolf,null,null,"Scottish born, and lived in Scotland all my life. I support it; I'm convinced by the arguments and I think they make sense. Westminster doesn't represent our interests, I hold that as a basic fact. England seems to have absolutely no interest in reforming it, I consider federalism to be an impossibility; it simply won't happen. I've done my research, I've read the figures; as far as I'm concerned, barring exceptional circumstances, Scotland going independent would be massively beneficial; both in terms of politics and economics. 

I have to say though; I'd raise an eyebrow at those treating ""No"" as the ""Safe choice"". People talk about the fact we're devolved protecting us from the worst of the cuts down south, but really, I consider that an incredibly naive view. 

Just to give one particularly bad scenario: The Barnett formula, which gives the Scottish Government it's budget, is based on Westminster public spending as well as a myriad of other factors. If Westminster were to completely privatise the NHS and sell it off, then the Barnett formula budget the Scottish Government gets would be cut proportionally to the loss of the NHS in England, which means that the Scottish Government would be left in the position where they would no longer be able to afford to keep the NHS running properly, which means that the Scottish Government will either be forced to make enormous cuts in other areas, or be forced to privatise parts of the Scottish NHS, due to changes made in England. An unlikely scenario, but not an impossible one, and one that could potentially happen in England, what with the ways things are going down there. 

Honestly, to the people saying they'd like to ""Hear the facts and the debates"" before making their decision, I have one piece of advice for you. Start looking for them yourself. I'm dubious you're going to get them from mainstream media or the various parties. Also, despite the reputation of /r/Scotland, I wouldn't dismiss it entirely; it is -heavily- pro-Independence for the most part, but the people there have been paying attention to the debate for years, and have gathered up a plethora of sources and statistics that they will quite happily link for you if you ask for them.

Is there a liquid market for 10 year electricity futures?  But also which price are they comparing it too?  The price for a Wind Generator?  A CCG?  Coal?  Nuclear that has already had all the investment funded?

If they were going for a funding based on power generation, a fixed price, inflation adjusted would be the only practical way.  Otherwise there is a floating risk for the companies involved with potentially billions of pounds at stake.

The downside to funding electricity infrastructure projects via a guaranteed price is that it puts the funding onto people who use energy, rather than those who have the most money (like Income Taxation).  People who have more money to invest in home modernisation, will be least effected.  I've spent hundreds of pounds with LED lighting in my flat.  I can light my entire flat for less than the price of two old incandescent bulbs.  Not to mention these bulbs will last decades before wearing out.  As such my energy usage will be lower than someone who has less disposable money.

Only if she wants a reference, but by the sounds of it, she wouldn't get a decent reference anyway. Technically it might be possible for a company to claim against you for breaking contract but given it's a small business this is not likely to happen. You have to be a very important employee with significant investment by the employer for it to be worth claiming anything from you. And she can always turn around and claim constructive dismissal. So this would most likely not be an avenue for them given the history of abuse.

Has she tried speaking with them and explaining she doesn't like the abuse? I personally would have a meeting and explain the way I felt, if they are not willing to change then I would quit.

If this was a larger company, I would pursue constructive dismissal. My father had a similar situation, he was sidelined and eventually forced out.... as it got too much he resigned, just walked out.

&gt;Either you reinstate the death penalty (which is prone to the government making mistakes and killing innocent people), or you lock people away forever and never let them out, or you accept that sometimes people are going to complete their sentences and go on to commit further crimes.

I'm sorry, but you lock up those people you think are a danger to society. If that means never letting them out, so be it. I cannot see that the risk is worth it.

&gt;We try to minimise the risk of criminal misconduct, but it's simply not possible to eradicate it. 

And locking dangerous people up is one of the best ways of minimising criminal misconduct. Again, are you saying that, because we can't eradicate murders, we should just let people out?

&gt;The state is not to blame when someone commits a crime - only they are.

The state has failed the victim when a known murderer is allowed out.

&gt;I think that consideration of the social contract is necessary, too - if society is to expect civilised behaviour from citizens, it is also beholden upon society to teach civilised behaviour. 

Releasing murderers onto the streets is not civilised behaviour.",0,1382454085,null,0,false,0,ccx427l,t3_1oxyk1,t1_ccx427l,t1_ccx3iwd,null,1429027138,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is a logical fallacy. Just because we can't keep everyone safe all of the time doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

&gt;But whole life imprisonment is unethical and, obviously, contravenes the human rights agreements we are signatory to.

The leaf isn't distinct in that, though. That's my whole point and why it bothered me to begin with. There are a million things that could've prevented Clara's parents from meeting. There are a million factors leading up to her parents meeting and conceiving Clara, the leaf is only one of them.

Why were her parents there in that place? Something led them to be in that place before the leaf could even bring them together. Maybe one of them had a dog that they needed to walk, and that's why they were outside that day. Ok, so the dog is just as important as the leaf. What about the other person? Maybe someone told them they needed to get in shape, and so they decided to get some exercise. Ok now that other person is just as important as the leaf. Why did they both pick that park to go to? Maybe one of them had good memories of a picnic in that park. Ok, now that picnic is just as important as the leaf.

See where I'm going with that? If you take away Clara's intervention in steering the leaf from her own personal future, which is what I'm proposing makes the leaf special, then it's just like any one of the other myriad factors for her parents meeting.

In your previous comment you asked why ""the feminists haven't moved to ban"" such stereotypes.

MW is misleading because it only shows the potential peak, not what is actually generated which is why Watt/hours is a better measure. There is 3800MW of wind generating capacity installed in Scotland but that is its peak and it isn't reaching that or anything near and even then, that is only 4.5 times that of Hinkley B. If it were able to maintain that capacity then the renewable electricity generated would be in Terrawatt Hours, not Gigawatt Hours.

&gt; last year Scotland’s renewable electricity industry generated 14,825 gigawatt hours

The total of ALL renewables in Scotland, which includes wind, generated 14.825GWh which less than one quarter of one percent of the 6.1TWh total output of Hinkley B Reactor.

The wheelchair doesn't fold up and I assume that most users aren't able to walk/move about without it so as the able-bodied person who can find suitable space elsewhere I'd feel pretty shitty staying put.

My friend had a C-section and recovered at home, by the time she was able to go out (using a buggy) she was also able to handle the pram, including folding it up. If she hadn't been, she probably would have used her mouth words to ask for help. I do suspect there was a lack of goodwill (the article says she was worried about waking her child) and there was, of course, more to the incident - if you google it you come across some more information that doesn't make the wheelchair user appear like a chancer or whiner - it's about a change of policy since this has happened to him a couple of times.

Worldwide. And the last one in Fukushima took an earthquake and tsunami to cause it. Stanford University Professor Mark Jacobson who is seriously anti-nuclear PREDICTS only 120 deaths as a result of it.

The previous most serious one was Chernobyl in 1986, a quarter of a century earlier which resulted in 43 deaths mostly in the emergency workers attending immediately after the accident.

When was the last one in the UK that resulted in loss of life?

[Meanwhile in the UK](http://www.caithnesswindfarms.co.uk/accidents.pdf) Renewables UK in 2011 reported there had been 1500 wind turbine related accidents and worldwide there have been 144 fatalities to 30/9/2013, the worst one being in Brazil last year when a turbine fell onto a bus killing 17 people.

- 1 medium onion, sliced into half-circles
- Small splash soy sauce
- Stock cube (chicken/veg)
- solid sprinkle of chinese 5 spice
- Optionally - diced pork/chicken or any other meat really.
- Toasted sesame oil
- Thin noodles (can basically use any noodles)
- Optionallay - egg or two

Method:

- Boil water
- Add stock cube, 5 spice, onion (and meat if using it)
- Bring back to the boil, leave until the meat is looking done or if you're not using meat, for about 4 minutes.
- Add noodles, wait until noodles cooked
- If using egg, crack an egg into the edge of the pan and leave for another few minutes. Don't stir - you are poaching the egg, it should remain in 1 lump.
- Pour into bowl, drizzle toasted sesame oil, splash of soy sauce.

Great thing about this is that it is really tasty and really forgiving. If you forget any of the ingredients other than water/noodles, you're still gonna have a good meal and you can add loads of different things to literally spice things up.

As for a fresh noodle based meal...

* 1/4 tin of Chaokoh Coconut Milk (it really is the only one worth buying)
* Teaspoon Mae Ploy curry paste (red or green - i think the only difference is the colour)
* 1/2 cup frozen sweetcorn
* couple of asparagus spears cut into 1/2"" bits
* finely chopped spring onion
* handful of fresh rice noodles
* choice of (pre cooked) meat in small bite sized pieces (prawns/left over chicken etc)

1. Put the coconut milk in a saucepan and heat gently
2. Add the curry paste and mix well
3. Add sweetcorn and asparagus and simmer for a few minutes (this is why you want Chaokoh coconut milk - most others break down when you heat them)
4. Add meat (you're just reheating it)
5. Heat noodles for a couple of minutes
6. Add spring onion

The cheapest fuel that we use to make electricity (fossil fuels) are being extracted at a ridiculously fast rate because of the massively high global demand for energy, and as wells runs out we need to extract it from more expensive sources and use more expensive techniques, like fracking and tar sands. So we aren't going to run out yet as such but it's just a fact that we're going to spend more energy extracting the fossil fuels we need, making it more expensive.

Nuclear has very high up front costs and isn't big enough globally because so many countries are too dumb to bother using them, and some of the ones that do are on fucking tectonic faultlines (well done Japan!) so that isn't going to put a huge dent in energy prices either. Obviously we would be wise to make more energy with nuclear to be more self sufficient and save a small amount of money but it isn't going to effect the global price of electricity.

So, think of all the stuff that goes on in London, and all the websites and blogs that exist solely to document that (timeout, [hundreds of blogs](http://londonbloggers.iamcal.com/weblogs/) etc.), if something new or interesting opens people blog about it and other people go to check it out. Well London is obviously a big city, so there are lots of people into this kind of thing so lots of momentum to get new ideas started, but the next biggest Birmingham would be 15th in the US, and Manchester would be 24th. Now those cities also have blogs and websites about them (manchester in particular) but for those 3 cities in the UK there are already 24 similarly sized cities in the US. Also Americans do more online stuff thats just a fact.

All of those people and all of that stuff they're blogging about means that when someone has a good idea of finds something they like the potential audience is huge. I've lived in a variety of places in North America and in every one there was a huge blogging community who all tried out the things other people had done and its this kind of growth that leads to things like food trucks.

Someone needs to tell Ramires he shouldn't be going for two yellow cards every game though.

According to the most reliable sources, e.g. Amnesty International, the UN, the Red Cross etc. the Syrian regime is by far the biggest culprit when it comes to committing atrocities in this conflict like massacres, torture, rape and the overwhelming evidence shows the regime was responsible for use of chemical weapons. They've also used collective punishment against civilian areas which oppose the regime and responded to peaceful demonstrations with repeated violence which was the reason this entire conflict came about.

When protests began in Tunisia, the dictator Ben Ali stepped down, fled to Saudi Arabia and a relatively peaceful transition to democracy took place. Assad responded with extreme violence, use of chemical weapons and if we allow him to remain in power it shows dictators that when mass demonstrations begin against them they should use as much violence as possible to stay in power.",0,1382478740,null,0,false,0,ccxeg1o,t3_1p02kc,t1_ccxeg1o,t1_ccxcqz3,null,1429022221,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

People had been donating objects of personal importance to that parasite god for over a million years. They went out of their way to point this out in the episode, about how the personal value of an object determines its true worth in their society. Undoubtedly many of those objects donated long before Clara arrived are responsible for people being born or being killed, just like Clara's leaf. I'd wager objects were donated that led to not just one birth or death, but many.

I support negotiations with the regime but if Assad feels he is winning the war on the ground he won't be willing to step down, this is only likely if he feels outright defeat is inevitable. Currently it looks like a stalemate which isn't good for anyone except the regime, it means continuous bloodshed and the regime doesn't fall. 

The best option is to support the rebel forces to ensure a strong negotiating position and then a settlement involving a transition to democracy excluding the Ba'athists. You're right about the SNC being unable to govern all of Syria, but they would only be in charge of the transition. The rest can be done bottom up, i.e. through local elections and many rebel-held regions already have their own local governments formed already. All that would need to be done is a federal body created where all of these local representatives can meet to form a unity government. This would include Kurds, Islamists and those allied to the SNC.

I'm over 6 foot, generally a bit beardy and somewhat swarthy looking. Consequently there's nothing in particular people can pick on that would be a property of an 'undodgy' person, if you get me. I can't think of a privileged group - save the 'born wealthy and influential' one' - that I don't belong to. That said, I've had a few comments from people but they were specifically personal and quite a few years ago.

I can only sympathise with the shit you get and assume it's because people think you're an easy target. I have to wonder what goes through the minds of people like that: firstly why the fuck do they assume that you would give a shit about what some random twat thinks, secondly why the hell do they think they have a 'right' to voice their opinion/view to you? That's the main one - what do they think they'll achieve? Obviously it can get to you, I understand, but the mindset I don't get at all: ""Yeah, I'm going to comment on a trivial aspect of this person's physical appearance and try to make them feel shit. They *need* to know.'

Generally I can only assume that it's someone (consciously or otherwise) reacting defensively to something they don't like about themselves, or something that someone has said, and looking to lash out to make themselves feel better.

My advice... Well, I don't know. Perhaps whatever makes you feel better, but maybe a truly cutting put down would be a good course of action. I don't know what that might be though - ignoring it won't solve it, but it won't give the fuckwit any (more) satisfaction.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"&gt; Only acceptable to you... any settlement without the Ba'athists would be unacceptable to a sizable portion of the Syrian population. Whatever the crimes of the regime, they are the preferred party of at least a third of Syrians.

Preferred party out of what choices? The reason we don't know who is preferred and who isn't is because in Syria, when someone states an opinion about who they want governing them they/their family/friends/local area get tortured/raped/killed. If a pro-Ba'athist party wants to set up in Syria after the current regime is removed and they want to fairly compete in elections then that's fine. Even if it was the case that 33% of people ""liked"" the regime, the fact it murders the other 67% who don't is unacceptable. 

&gt;And forming a federal government is unlikely, the Alawites, Christians, Druze and Kurds are more likely to break away than submit to a democracy which would inevitably involve strong Islamist elements. And any attempt at breaking up the country would just plunge it back into civil war as all sides try to claim the major cities.

I don't buy into the argument that minorities would attempt to use violence and secede instead of take part in a federal government. It's not in minority groups' interest to resort to violent means as they'd be severely disadvantaged in the case of a civil war and risk being wiped out. Taking part in a federal government where they'd be proportionately represented is far more preferable. Also a constitution would protect minority rights. Kurds may seek autonomy/devolution but they've so far said they aren't seeking independence.

It's a myth that Syrians are divided along sectarian lines, the regime played up the sectarian angle to ensure it lasted as long as possible as it gave itself some legitimacy but in reality Syrians generally get along well along different ethnic/religious lines.

&gt;As far as I can see, it's talk to Assad and negotiate or it's war. You might not like it, but that's the reality.

It's already war. Assad has finite resources and his currency reserves have now depleted and the ongoing conflict means the regime's expenses are far higher than their revenues. Add to that the fact 80% of the Syrian army are conscripts and Hezbollah and Iran can't bulk up the numbers enough I don't see the regime doing anything but losing territory over the long term. The rate of jihadis pouring into Syria has only been increasing (there were very few when the conflict began) and the pockets of their Gulf backers are very deep - whether public or private. I don't want to see a situation where it's foreign jihadists gaining too much influence in negotiations (if they are willing to negotiate) and it only causes further problems down the line. By firmly backing the SNC and rebels who are opposed to Al Qaeda we can at least create a decent foundation for negotiations to begin.",0,1382485939,null,0,false,0,ccxhb9p,t3_1p02kc,t1_ccxhb9p,t1_ccxgf5u,null,1429020884,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For those wondering, we over at the [Fresh Meat Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FreshMeatTV) are expecting the new Series of the show to premiere the first week of November, this year (in two weeks' time)!

I go into detail in the [post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FreshMeatTV/comments/1oiuaj/fairly_confirmed_series_3_returns_tuesday/).

~~TL:DR - Several of the actors and other sources have claimed the first week / early November as the premiere, with only Charlotte Ritchie (Oregon) claiming Tuesday, November 5th specifically on her Twitter.~~

**Edit with important update: It has been announced that Series 3 will premiere Monday, November 4th at 10pm on Channel 4, and will also air a week early on 4oD on Monday, October 28th at 10pm.**

We also have to consider their strength in transfers come January, if any of you aren't aware of sports over here in the states, the Major League Baseball World Series is about to go underway. The two teams at bat against each other are the St. Louis Cardinals vs. the Boston Red Sox, the latter of which are owned by the same guy who owns Liverpool, John Henry.

I'm not saying he's going to go all out in January but should Boston win this month he definitely will be seeing some more income go his way and that could seriously bolster Liverpool come winter.

That means he's really competing with the next row of forward players- where we are overloaded already. 

He acquitted himself very well on the left wing when he was called upon, and I hope he gets a start in the Europa on Thursday. And the league cup against Hull, if he's not gone on loan by then. 

But I agree with AVB- I was excited for his loan to Norwich, and then unfortunately he barely played. Although that was down to a nasty injury as well.

true,Dr-RaoulDuke,null,null,"My sister has been living in London for the past 3 years or so.  Last year, my wife and I had our honeymoon in the UK.  I made sure to plan it around a West Ham home game.  Got to watch a match at Upton Park against Arsenal.  I knew it would be a tough match and wasn't expecting to come away with a win but was just happy to be there!  Anyway, my sister happens to live in East London, just a few stations down at Bromley-by-Bow, so we planned the day out accordingly.  We would grab a few beers at Tesco's then hop on the tube and go down the 3 stations to Upton Park.  We'd head to one of the local pubs, preferably the Bolyn, have a few more beers then head over to the Bobby Moore Stand.  Well, turns out that the particular tube line was under repair that Saturday, and we  had to take a bus to Strattford Mall, then hop on the tube there.  By the time we got to Strattford the tube was packed.  Myself, the wife, my sister and her BF managed to squeeze in somehow.  To be honest, I didn't even care how packed the tube was and by the time it got going everyone had started chanting and singing.  Plus it gave us some time to drink our beers.  Anyway, we get to Upton Park and the atmosphere on Green Street is electric.  The first pub we came upon was the Queens and you could barely even get in, so we decided to just finish the beers that we had bought at Tesco's right outside, which proved to be a bad move as we were made to toss them out by the cops.  My sis's BF and I tried to grab a quick pint at the pub but it would have taken us ages, so we decided to go in early.  Again, you couldn't ask for a better atmosphere and about 10 to 15 mins into the first half, Diame scores a beauty!  Took it down the left side, cut into the box with a sweet dribble, then put the ball away into the far left corner!  The place went nuts!  Unfortunately, Arsenal went on to score 3 unanswered and won the game, but the scoreline did not really reflect the game as it was really a close one.  Anyway, one of the best sporting nights of my life!  ",0,1382502411,null,0,false,0,ccxnjj6,t3_1o8lrk,t1_ccxnjj6,t3_1o8lrk,null,1429017907,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1

There is no 'best' series or Doctor, that's just personal preferences that people share. Watch the entire New series, starting with 'Rose', episode 1 of Series 1 (the Classic show is referred to by 'Seasons', not 'Series'). Be prepared for a few lame episodes while the show finds its feet again and know that it *is* a campy show. Don't go in expecting blood and violence and sex - it's a family show. It acts like it. But that doesn't mean it's not deep and meaningful!
