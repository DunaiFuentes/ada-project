This allows you to study at least one of the classical languages from scratch during your degree, whilst still studying the wide array of literature, ancient history and philosophy that forms the curriculum for the Classics I course. The main difference is that you'll be expected to cover less material in the original language.

As you can see from the website -http://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/classics-ii.html - formal qualifications in Latin or Greek are absolutely not a necessity for this course. Studying French won't do you any harm, as - if you do well at it - it demonstrates some linguistic aptitude. 

If you aren't already, try and read a variety of classical texts in translation, ideally from both Greek and Latin authors, so you can decide which language you'd prefer to learn. This will also serve you well in demonstrating your enthusiasm for the subject in your personal statement etc.

I'm afraid that I'm a UK student, so have no notion of the mechanics of the admissions process for a North American student - as /u/illu45 suggested, contact the admissions office - but a lack of formal teaching in the classics absolutely need not prevent you from applying.

Boris is in the enviable position of being a Tory that people across the political spectrum actually like. He uses this bumbling-oaf persona to win over people, and make it seem like he is a nice guy. As a last through of the dice, when realising Theresa isn't Thatcher 2.0, or that Adam Afriyie sounds a bit too foreign for a Tory MP (I seriously think he'll be in contension for leadership soon), Boris could get the leadership because he is seen to have an affinity with the people, and may be able to win an election.

However, if he did take a step into mainstream politics, I imagine the opposition spin doctors would have a field day with him. He has a fair few personal life controversies, such as an affair, possible nepotism and corruption, and probably plenty of other things they could dredge up from his past if he took such an important position. His off-beat and non-politically correct comments would no longer be laughed off, or forgotten about soon after, and everything he says would be carefully listened to until he made a faux pas, from which the media and opposition would rip him a new one. He would also have to present Tory policies, instead of doing cushy things like Boris bikes in London, and after hearing him announce Poor Tax or another Conservative idea, the none traditionally Conservative voting public would have the veil pulled away from their eyes.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"Let me explain why it's not a double standard, even though it might seem to be.

There are some things that you can judge a player on that can depend on the quality of the opposition and some things that are independent of the quality of the opposition. Shooting is one. It's no easier to hit the ball into the top corner from the edge of the box when your playing a good team or a bad team. The goal is the same size, the distances are the same and the ball is the same. You might find it harder to get into that position but once your there it's the same. Other things are highly dependent of the opposition. Weaker teams would probably be slower or lose concentration more. 

Lamela played well against Sherrif. His ball control was good, his passing was good and his finishing was good. In these cases it wasn't because Sherrif were poor. 

Contrast that with Defoe. He might score against teams in the Europa League but he also misses a fair amount. He's offside a lot which probably has nothing to do with the opposition but it should be easier to stay onside with a so-called weaker team

* Foundation/Primer/BB Cream
* Bronzer and highlighter for contouring
* colour-correcting concealer
* Blush
* Nude/translucent setting/mattifying powder
* Eye Primer
* Brow Powder and setting wax/gel
* Most likely several shades of eyeshadow blended together.  darker ones will go on the lid and in the crease, lighter ones will be used to highlight under the brow bone/in the inner corner of the eye
* eyeliner - i can't be sure but I would guess she is using a dark brown liner on the upper and lower lashline and a white or taupe highlighting liner on the waterline

* lipliner

&gt; This is the worst Chelsea squad we are all going to see for quite some time

Come on, it's better than last season's squad, and the Champions League one. We finished 6th and 3rd with them, I'd wager we will finish above that this season. 

&gt; we've done far more with far less in recent history.

We won the Champions League with basically this squad - Drogba, who wasn't even very influential in the League that season anyway, so I wouldn't say we had 'far less'.

The only relevant comparisons IMO are the seasons we won the league 05,06,10. We are a long way from Jose's first teams, but then again so are most teams of the Premier League era. We aren't as solid defensively as we were in 2010, and we aren't scoring for fun like we did then as well.

Overall I agree, there is nothing to panic about, I don't see anyone running off with the title this year (I was worried about City but they can't seem to do anything away from home). So we can afford not to be as good as the standard we have set in recent years to win the league because no one else is that great either.

The only real question is: Is this a team that needs to be nurtured and developed? Or one that needs to be altered before it can be a force like Jose's first team. I would lean towards the latter. The squad doesn't have the amazing balance of 2004-2006, or even 2010. We still look short in the deeper midfield positions, and lack an amazing striker.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The first question is how he gets to Westminster. He has stated his intent to remain as Mayor for his whole term and not to get a second job, meaning that he won't get there until 2016, a year after the election. In the event that Cameron has not won, a new leader should already be in place by then and in a direct run-off, Boris would have a lot of difficulty.

If he chooses to stand in 2015 then there will be quite a bit of backlash and infighting, and if they lose he might be blamed for disrupting the leadership. This would only hurt him in the short and long term.

Consequently, his chances of being PM and leader before 2020 are very slim. He could become leader in 2015, but have quite a fractured party who have grounds to be disloyal (as their leader was), or he could be party leader in 2016 and potential PM in 2020 which is quite a way off.

We remember the ones that make it, there were hundreds of 'next prime ministers' throughout Thatchers reign and it ended up going to Major, a dull and uninspiring yet establishment choice. In 2015/6, that is probably going to May, Gove or Osbourne depending on what happens in the meantime.

As to how he would be as Prime Minister, he would probably be fine. He is intelligent, good at interacting with the public, and is a lot better at the populist stuff than Cameron and Miliband are. He is a character, which people like, and he can articulate things which people care about in a more human way than most politicians. He also owns his priviledge very effectively.

There is fertile socially conservative ground in the country which he can appeal to. In addition, British politics tends to focus around the person who can articulate Thatcherism and its benefits for the people most effectively.

He could be a good party leader and a good prime minister for the Conservatives.

Granted, this subreddit, the Guardian and the Labour Party would hate him, but they hate all conservatives other than those saying left wing stuff while claiming to be a tory.

Is he a perfect candidate? Hell no. Is he better than the majority of candidates on both front benches? Yes. Is he better than Gove, Osbourne, May, Cooper and Miliband?

In the same way that Labour likes a politician that the city hates, the Tories like an education secretary that teaching unions hate. He does a much better job at appealing to the people that he is trying to appeal to than people who dislike him and his policies recognise.

In this, he is similar to Osbourne. They are both exceptionally smart people who are very good at understanding political theory and constructing strategy. Their weakness for 2015 is that their current record can count against them quite significantly, consequently Osbourne will need to have achieved a decent amount of growth which can restore his battered reputation while Gove needs a number of Free Schools to have been set up and to do exceptionally well.

May on the other hand is boring, dull but not obviously incompetant. Extraditing Captain Hook has helped her with the Grassroots, but she is much maligned for the 'Nasty Party' comments she made a while ago.

The interview is **key**, so they want to see you in the flesh, but I know that they do conduct Skype interviews for international students. I don't think it'll hurt your chances at all to be honest, as long as do well.

If you've not done any Classical languages before, you'll be applying for the IIA/IIB course, which I have a couple of friends doing, and they really enjoy. It's a course aimed at people who haven't done anything before, so don't worry about that, but do make sure you've shown you have an interest in your subject; it's all very well saying it, but unless you can prove it they can't be sure you're telling the truth. Try and find a summer school/job that's related to Classics, and read some translations of the big authors - Catullus, Cicero, Homer, and Virgil - just make sure you've demonstrated a love of Classics. Doing French is a plus too - it shows you like language, and if you're good at it it's a good sign. It's also fairly similar to Latin in terms of vocab, which makes life easier if you do IIA

Although he doesn't quite have the amazing long range technique that Gerrard has, but who does.



I think with Henderson we are seeing a player really flourish this season and the competition in the squad is only helping push him on as a player and right now i think it would be rather unfair to leave him out, he works hard and closes down well, has an eye for a pass and can actually make the pass as well all of that mixed in with James Milner like versatility and you can see why it is no surprise that he has made over a 100 appearances in such a short period of time for us.

However, as the Taliban now, this is a different issue. The US (and some other states) have maintained that the law of war operates against terrorist groups and capture members can be held for the duration of the conflict as combatants. So they would say, yes, Geneva applies.

There are plenty of people who under-occupy a house but get full benefit, they simply found accommodation that's well priced. Meanwhile on the social housing side it is IMPOSSIBLE to do that now, because there's always a deduction.

The huge issue with the bedroom tax is people in social housing simply have never expected to have to move from their home.

*In 1996, the BBC applied for a trademark to use the blue police box design in merchandising associated with Doctor Who. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim, maintaining that they owned the rights to the police box image. In 2002 the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC, arguing out that there was no evidence that the Metropolitan Police—or any other police force—had ever registered the image as a trademark. In addition, the BBC had been selling merchandise based on the image for over three decades without complaint by the police.*

The author points out that we have created more ""Big Chances""--22--than anyone else in the Premier League.

We generate Shots inside the Box on Target at a perfectly respectable rate; our problem is a dismal 15% conversion rate on those shots. The League average is about 35%, and had we merely converted at the average rate we'd have several more goals and likely several more points in the table. 

The GOOD NEWS is that, through his pretty robust analysis of the last three years of play, he finds that the conversion rate on SiBoT over the first 11 games has NO PREDICTIVE VALUE for the rest of the season. In other words, we can expect to revert to the league average over time, i.e., our scoring will improve because our luck will get better. Also, he points out that AVB has no history of teams converting at unusually low rates, so there's no reason to suspect that we won't see improvement in this area. Hell, the team with the worst conversion rate through 11 games at any point in the past three years was Wigan a couple years back, when they were at 8%. Even they ended up around 32% by the end of the season.

Our underlying numbers are really strong, even if we're not getting the results we want. That's frustrating and encouraging at the same time. I'm not trying to be all sunshine and daisies here, because the team certainly has issues to address; it seems logical to think that teams  improve their SiBoT conversion rate because they adjust and improve their approach. But, I think overall we have a lot of cause to be optimistic, especially considering our place on the table given our incredibly bad (unlucky) conversion rate.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"This has not been a ""roller coaster season"", Chelsea is just under preforming. They have been eking out points. Norwich, scored at the 85th minute, Cardiff, much closer than the score line suggest, City, late goal by Torres, lost to Newcastle, and an undeserved point vs WBA.

This season has been a struggle so far. There has only been one comfortable win, and that was the very first game against Hull. Anyone who watches the games can see that there is something missing. Most of the goals have been scored on fluke goals or counter-attacks. They need to be able to score when they have the possession. This has not been happening.  

For a roller coaster team, all you have to do is look at City. In one match, they look like world beaters, the next match, they lose to the worst team in the league.

For starters, it would show that they're already pretty on the ropes if they're going with someone like Boris who, after all, is more popular as an entertainer than he is as a politician per se, it'd show they really are running out of more serious options. What's more, he would be a very high-risk candidate. If he succeeds on the back of the current persona he has now, that would only hold out for a short period of time; Boris would inevitably need to start acting more Prime Ministerial as time goes on, and he'd lose the one thing that makes him popular to people in the first place.

Can he do it? My gut says 'not now' - the Tory party is already in quite a state, having failed to win an election they really had no excuse not to win, given how unpopular New Labour were, particularly Gordon Brown. They're more likely to go with someone who would be seen as a safe pair of hands on the economic front, and currently Boris isn't known as a wonk. I know he's more intelligent than he's often given credit for, but he's popular amongst the public for things which have virtually nothing to do with politics at all, certainly nothing to do with policy. I would hazard if you asked most people who are fans what policies of his they are most supportive of, you'd get a blank look.

This doesn't mean he couldn't undergo a rebranding, but he'd need to start doing it now, and in some ways it looks like he already is. But really, he's so far had an exceptionally easy ride from the press, who usually treat him as an entertainer first and a politician second. If he starts positioning himself as someone eager for power and a more serious contender, he'll face a media onslaught (which is sort of beginning to happen already) and much more negative publicity than he's used to, and could risk damaging the one thing that's made him popular through rebranding and adopting a more serious persona. One thing that I've noticed is that Boris is pretty poor at answering even easy 'tough' questions, and he seems quite thin-skinned. When he's asked things like 'do you want to be PM?' he often bumbles and gives a vague answer. Politics 101 would likely teach the correct answer is 'I'm not interested in that right now, I'm interested in working for my constituents'. Stuff he really should have memorised answers to about his slightly dodgy dealings he just doesn't seem to have thought through. So I'm skeptical of his ability to contend for the top slot - the Tories sort of put up with him for the moment because he's one of the few among them popular with the public, but if he started going for their cabinet posts and Premierships, it might be another matter entirely.",0,1384197728,null,0,false,0,cdbxb7i,t3_1qdiwb,t1_cdbxb7i,t3_1qdiwb,null,1428701717,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That he's McGann's character DURING the Time War! That's why Smith see's him in his Timestream. He is a real version, but he's the version that Eccleston was trying to forget.
Lets not ignore that Hurt looks like Eccleston, the hair and the clothes. So I think we are looking at 8.5 or older 8. The man who killed his own species. The Oncoming Storm.

If McGann can be in the series as an aging timelord which later becomes Hurt during the TimeWar, then it be perfect! Because Tennant and Smith will help to destroy him, forcing the regeneration into Eccleston. Which would tie up ALL OF THE PLOT HOLES remaining.

Health will play a role, no doubt, as will the growing familiarity of players with one another (Soldado and Eriksen, for example) and with the league (Lamela). I think we've already seen an emphasis on a wider attack in the past few games, though it hasn't borne fruit yet.

true,DiscoPopShop,null,null,"I ask this because I am a Milan fan, and I do follow Serie A.

First of all, Milan's financial situation is vastly better than you make it out to be. Our funding from Berlusconi was cut after the 11/12 season and so sales had to be made (notably Ibra and Thiago Silva who brought in a LOT of money and saved us a small fortune in wages) along with a lot of other high wage players leaving the club. As we stand now, we're virtually breaking even without the help of Berlu and so we aren't in any dire situation. Not making the CL could hurt our future spending but wouldn't affect us selling our players.

Second, he hasn't been used as a #10. Second striker, yes, but he's said himself he is looking forward to adapting and to be honest when he was banging them in during the first half of last season he played as a left winger coming inside into scoring positions. Very similar place and role as he will do under the new system. We're also back to experimenting with a 4-3-3 with Kaka on the left wing, so El Shaarawy would probably take that place and Kaka move infield should we keep this formation.

Lastly, I don't quite think you understand the nature of El Shaarawy's connection to the club. He is a Milanista through and through. He breathes the club. He let the club decide his new contract because he trusted their evaluation, when a huge bid came in from City this summer (talking 30million+ easily, and rumoured to be matched by other clubs) Galliani called a meeting with him and his agent to notify him of the bid. He instantly said he didn't want to leave and that was that. Not to mention the fragile relationship between the fans and the management already. Were they to sell El Shaarawy I don't think they could escape Milano alive.

Bottom line, Milan wouldn't sell, El Shaarawy wouldn't go.

By the way, each TARDIS spawned is individual. This means in order to put a TARDIS in a TARDIS, you can't just spawn another TARDIS. Because if you exit the TARDIS which is in your TARDIS, your TARDIS will be invisible.

To materialize your TARDIS into it's own interior, use the Sonic Screwdriver to link the TARDIS (Hold Alt + L/R Mouse) Then in your TARDIS, press R on the floor of it. Careful, while the TARDIS is materializing it will have no collision with it's own interior. You have to catch it with your physgun, then wait until it's fully materialized. Then throw your TARDIS somewhere inside it's own interior and the TARDIS exterior will shake causing the TARDIS's interior to shake and because the TARDIS is in it's own interior the shaking of the interior causes the TARDIS exterior to shake. It's an infinite loop!

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; in political terms, Ireland was not ruled as one kingdom before the arrival of the Normans; however the people did see themselves as one people, and the people had one language (Old Gaelic), lived under one political system (local kingdoms and an over-arching, 'by merit' elective Highkingship) and had one law system (Brehon laws) The division which today we recognise as Irish and Briton was referred to as ""Gael"" and ""Gall"" - common or foreign. That we didn't have an overarching government - most of the time - is irrelevant; England itself had only recently combined to one Kingdom when it came and got involved in Ireland.

My knowledge of this particular period is not fantastic, but I think to characterise the Irish as ""one people"" is probably a bit generous. As far as I can recollect throughout Europe local ties at this point were far more important than national ones (and indeed most nationalist theories trace its real routes to 18th century), and I know enough about the highkingship to realise that it was not capable of uniting Ireland against a foreign aggressor. 

&gt; Regardless of the legal standpoint, Irish people view the differences between Britain and Ireland as very much cultural differences. We have come together - as most anglophone countries have in this age of globalisation - but (and I'm sure you don't mean it) it is a bit offensive to just dismiss us as being the same as you; a bit like telling a Pole he is German or Russian because those countries controlled their lands. Your comparison to Asian-British is telling; they are Asian-British because they've grown up in Britain. Perhaps you're basing it on Britain's sizeable Irish-immigrant-ancestry population?

My point about Britishness is I think the meaning is pretty vague at this point, having enough multicultural overtones to be pretty watered down as a cultural descriptor. 

Perhaps this speaks to my own languid sense of nationality, but if someone said ""Oh, the English are pretty much like the Irish,"" I wouldn't view it as untrue, let alone an insult. Same goes for comparisons to any of the Anglosphere, and for that matter much of Western Europe. I realise much heritage is specific to each country, but so much is shared (partly because of American dominance of the media) that it has eroded a lot of difference between western countries. 

&gt; There is no shared citizenship or recognition of the commonwealth in Ireland. Britain's concessions to this are as a matter for its own benefit or that of its own citizens, as many ""British"" are Irish emigrants, and the problem of Northern Ireland and its confused nationality issues requires Britain to ensure the inclusion of everyone that is British. Ireland extends the same benefits but only to anyone born on the island of Ireland.

I'd heard otherwise, but if you are sure I'll have to yield to you. 

&gt; Again, I don't think this is worth the offence.

true,Dariune,null,null,"It's a tricky one and it depends hugely on what type of person you are and what your interests are. 

You will obviously talk easier and more passionately about things you have a genuine interest in and so any clubs or group activities you do should be ones have an interest. 

Having said that ... competetive sports are a good one. Teams in sport give a feeling of comaraderie and therefore an easy opening to talk to other people in the same team as you. 

If sports arent your thing have a look to see if there are any dancing/martial arts clubs around you. They are a great place to meet people because in both you are often paired off with people. 

If you prefer the less physical there should be a book or chess club you could get involved in. Perhaps not as good for meeting people but certainly several steps up from being on your own. 

Frisbee is a good one. If during the summer you go to a park with a frisbe and throw it around, chances are people may well want to join you. 

So the long and short of it is, join a club or do an interactive hobby where you can meet people. 

However, all of this is redundant if you foget the one golden rules to making friends. Say yes! For a short while just say yes. It doesn't matter what to. If you are invited to something say yes. If it isn't your thing, be honest. State that you wouldn't normally be up for it but you fancy the company or words to that effect. 

But whatever it is. Say yes! 

Now I know you said you aren't into getting drunk but are you opposed to going to pubs? 

If not then after meeting people and having spoken to them a few times, invite them out for a quiet drink. If not that then wait for a good movie to come out and say you REALLY want to see it and are they interested in checking it out. 

If that doesn't appeal either say you want to check out/ have a favourite resteaurant and invite a few people for a meal. 

Make it a shared experience where everyone can get involved and feel as if their company is desired and they will generally leave feeling good about the experience and want to do it again. 

Through that you can then develop bonds etc etc. 

Hope thats okay.

On a side note:

Basically, she sealed her own fate with that move. Think it through - had she not done that, she would have regenerated in the Library, but had she regenerated, Tennant's 10th Doctor would have known that she was also ""Timey-wimey"", and that could possibly have ended up with River/Melody not even being born in 10's ""future"".

River using up all her regens results in eliminating the possibility of what could have been a very messy paradox.

The saddest part about all that is the Doctor knew [remembered] what would happen in the Library to River if she did this, which is why he insisted that she shouldn't - had he been in any condition to think things through at the time, he would have said nothing because he would have realized that if she listened to him and didn't save him, the ""River Paradox"" might have resulted from it.

Some of them are believable but some of them seem to be missing other information, even with the sources.  

&gt; You have a job interview which overruns so you arrive at your job centre appointment 9 minutes late. You get sanctioned for a month.  

When you read the source, the man in question did not inform the Job Centre that he had an interview, nor did he tell them he might be late. The interview overran and he was late. You still should tell the JobCentre and prepare that interviews can run late. It's not hard. You phone them prior the interview and say ""I might be late today because of an interview. Just in case it overruns.""  
 

&gt; You’ve been unemployed for seven months and are forced onto a workfare scheme in a shop miles away, but can’t afford to travel. You offer to work in a nearer branch but are refused and get sanctioned for not attending your placement.  

I'm pretty sure travel is reimbursed?    

&gt; You miss your job centre appointment as it clashes with your work programme interview. You get sanctioned.  

Again, even the source is missing context. Did this person tell them in advance that s/he had an interview and give prior warning?  

&gt;  You volunteer in a youth club. The job centre thinks this is ‘paid work’ so you are sanctioned.  

It's not as simple as that. When you volunteer off your own back, you *must* tell the JobCentre, it doesn't matter if it's unpaid. They need to know so they can update your record and they need to check with the Youth Centre themselves to confirm you are volunteering. This is made very clear (was to me anyway). 

&gt; You lost your job and are now on contributions-based jobseeker’s allowance (paid on the basis of your earlier National insurance contributions). You get your job centre appointment day wrong and turn up on a Thursday instead of a Tuesday. You are sanctioned for four weeks.  

Well, obviously.   

Last but not least, a lot of these sanctions say 3 months or 13 weeks.  You only get sanctioned for that long if you have have been sanctioned previously and are a ""repeat offender"". The only time your first sanction is more than 4 weeks is when it's categorised under ""High Level"" which is the worst kind.  

I'm currently signing-on (have been since before summer) and had an interview today. I know the JobCentre can be useless, stupid and completely wrong, but this blog, even with sources, really isn't providing all the information. I mean, a single Tweet on Twitter as source? Come on.  

I might get ripped into for this because, well, who doesn't like bashing the JobCentre? And I here I am seemingly sticking-up for them. (Also, this sub is known for not liking opposing views...) But I feel the need to point such things out. I know you can be sanctioned for stupid things such as this:  

&gt; You don’t apply for an IT job as it requires skills you don’t have. You get sanctioned.  

THAT'S believable, but some of these examples in the blog...I'd take them with a pinch of salt.

Agreed mistakes/controversial decisions haven't been fully taken out, and reviews can actually cause problems. Can understand why you don't like the argument, Its oft repeated and not entirely convincing to some. Was hardly a detailed response, if I were to expand is also argue it'd undermine the ref and why should players listen/obey him, and why would refs want to do it if most decisions were referred to video? That arguably can also have an aspect of egotistical behaviour to it. If I was a ref I certainly would take offence to someone telling me basically I can't do my job. Why would I do it in that case? It does indeed work in rugby, but in rugby the players almost always respect the referees decision, don't back chat and tell him to fuck off. When the ref says enough, they listen. That doesn't currently happen in football and further video technology would only make this worse in my opinion.

Also would say it's not possible to make this viable at most levels. Obviously not grass roots, but even league one/two won't be able to get this sorted. Considering so many people harp on about parity, this would be anything but, and would create a further divide between the top levels and the lower professional leagues.

I'd like technology to be used more to deal with retrospective action. It's silly, but I like the human error in football games. Realise this is slightly contradictory to what was said above.

**Reasons for Sky**

* Sky Sports are the best at sports (particularly Premier Matches). It costs an extra £22 on top of the standard Sky Entertainment package. You can also get HD &amp; 3D. HD is actually quite good for football matches, I find.

*Edit: Even if you buy Sky Sports as an add-on to Virgin/BT, you still only get Sky Sports 1 and 2. Not 3 &amp; 4 or News &amp; F1. Also, only in Standard Def.*

* If you really like films/movies, then their channels show stuff a good year or so before Netflix or anyone get them. They stick them on their On Demand (SkyGo and on the SkyBox) service too which is pretty comprehensive.

* If you have Sky TV, then you can get internet at a very cheap rate. A decent (but not fiberoptic) connection is often as much as £10 extra a month.


**Reasons against Sky**

* If you're just watching the odd bit of TV, then Freeview is pretty good. 
* Some Freeview/FreeSat boxes also give you the ability to record, pause and do all the Sky+ stuff.
* If you're on BT Broadband, you can get BT Vision (which is a pretty good equivalent) for a pretty cheap price. That includes HD channels and a snazzy box. The same goes for Virgin &amp; their TiVO thingy.
* **You know someone with Sky Go**. If you do, then you can get the Sports (SS1-SS4, SSN, SS F1), entertainment (MTV, Discovery, Nat Geo etc), Movies AND all the On Demand stuff. Not in HD, mind.

Personally, I have:

* BT's Fastest Broadband Package 
* BT Vision ""Essential Extra"" (including BT Sports for free) through a Sky Box that isn't a Sky Box but works the same.
* An Xbox 360 With Sky Go for when I want to watch the football/movies.

I found that it helped a great deal to stay in touch with my friends via googlechat/MSN/Facebook/Whatsapp etc. Even just chatting about your day/job/shit you saw on Reddit. Joining a gym can help, especially if you get chatting to the staff or regulars there, and it has the added benefits of improving your health and making you look better. If you're going to be home alone, try putting the TV or radio on just to provide some background noise. Finally, you could get a cat or something?

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;If we were a country going places I would expect local libraries to be expanding with all this quality material available for pennies.

It's not that simple though, is it. Before going digital I was a regular peruser of secondhand bookstores and charity shops. It's true that, hidden among the tat, you can find some interesting finds - As a Sci-Fi fan I couldn't quite believe my luck upon finding first editions of every Philip. K. Dick book. But that was a most definite exception to the rule.

Let's assume a library pays .30 for a KG of books. Actually, let's assume the spend £4.50 buying 15KG worth. That 15KG then has to be sent to a central sorting location, where it has to be assessed. Charity stock isn't collectors grade - they'd have to ensure that it's at absolute minimum, better than the stock they sell to the public when clearing out existing stock.

That costs money. Which most libraries don't have. They'd have to sacrifice the time for librarians - or more likely ""volunteers"" [be they actual volunteers, or work placement / workfare staff], to sort through the content, in order to find appropriate materials.

Then it has to be catalogued. Again, time constraints.

Then finally, they have to physically find the shelf space for it. Most libraries are losing not only funding, but also shelving space, as they transition the services they offer to an ever digital populace - witness how many study booths have been ripped out, to make place for a coffee shop, more computers, or christ forbid - a ""Chill out lounge"".

There's a reason why a [surprisingly significant] number of libraries don't accept donations in the form of physical stock - i.e. a deceased relatives collection, books sourced from the discarded volumes even charity shops can't shift, are unlikely to be finding their ways to the shelves, any time soon.",0,1384208903,null,0,false,0,cdc2eie,t3_1qenqk,t1_cdc2eie,t3_1qenqk,null,1428699269,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

She is Home Secretary, which is one of the worst jobs you could possibly have in politics. She is responsible for every crime, every immigration target, she has to cut the amount that the police get paid, she has to spend years negotiating with the European Courts and she has to please everyone. She has to keep the Liberal Democrats happy, she has to keep the right wing eurosceptics happy, she has to atone for calling the conservatives nasty.

When she gives the backbenchers some nice, juicy, entirely made up red meat it is to applease them on things which are irrelevent and don't matter so that she can be a technocratic moderate on the stuff which really, really does matter.

She has to pretend to be anti-immigration while ensuring that we get as much labour in as possible to help the economy as much as possible. She has to appear strong on crime while cutting police numbers and focusing on rehabilitation. She has to crack down on drugs while basically enacting a decriminalisation of marajuana and a massive increase in the number of drug rehabilitation clinics.

She is doing a magnificient job of keeping all of those different groups from tearing her apart. She appears competant to almost everyone that matters.

The people she seems like a complete moron to are the people who actually understand european law, but there are exceptionally few of them and they are a statistical irrelevance.

Not since James Callahan has a Home Secretary become Prime Minister. The fact people are even thinking of her is a massive achievement given the role she is playing.

Manchester City and Manchester United are perfect examples, as they've both (arguably) been playing a 4-4-2 this season.

City have Aguero, who is capable of playing on the wing (for Argentina), behind a striker, or up front by himself. When he's played, Jovetic has played a similar role. United have Rooney, who drops deep into midfield and links play, can play on the wing if needed, and in fact can even play as a central midfielder. Welbeck, while not as talented, can also play out wide or behind a striker.

We don't have that type of player. Soldado and Defoe are both primarily goal-scorers in the box, not capable of playing a wide role or a deeper role. They're so similar that starting the two of them together would probably result in them getting in each other's way rather than linking up particularly well.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"What the hell are you talking about? His Generals did not all think he was a joke. Figures such as Alanbrooke challenged his judgement on many matters, such as his desire to retake Singapore via an amphibious taskforce. Ismay too, the chief military advisor to the government throughout the war and later first Sec.General of NATO, had his ups and downs with Churchill, as did Montgomery. However they all respected his judgement, and he deliberately surrounded himself with figures that he could trust to tell him that he was wrong. Not all liked him, nor admired him- nobody in such a position has ever enjoyed universal admiration amongst his generals, not even Napoleon. However it is telling that the most important military leaders of the war, such as Montgomery and Eisenhower, admired him, Eisenhower even claiming that Churchill ""came nearest to fulfilling the requirements of greatness in any individual that I have met in my lifetime"". Now I'd venture Ike Eisenhower, with Montgomery co-architect of D-Day and the Western European theatre, probably knew a bit more on the subject than either of us.

Was he popular in 1939? No, he had had a shakey record in government, making few friends in his earlier political career by switching parties to the Liberals, and made many mistakes. Of course he wasn't Prime Minister either, so I don't quite get what your point is there. He became Prime Minister in the May 1940 cabinet war crisis, using his gift for rhetoric to sway the outer cabinet from Halifax's position of begging Hitler and Mussolini for peace on fascist terms. By May 1940 we were losing the war hand over fist and looked out of it, with the government facing a vote of no confidence. Due to support from Attlee and Greenwood, leading Labour party figures, Churchill was made PM by Chamberlain's recommendation to George VI on May 10. Incidentally on this day Germany had launched blitzkrieg on Holland, Belgium and France, and the British Expeditionary Force was on the run, and a dozen days later had been driven off the continent. Churchill resisted Halifax's trying to bring political pressure to bear on him to discuss terms with Hitler, and in this two week period ensured through sheer force of character and sound rhetoric that the UK kept fighting. Without Churchill it is almost certain that during the May 1940 crisis we would have thrown in the towel, but instead the cabinet was reformulated, re-energised, and the entire war stratagem was reconfigured. Not only that but many historians of the period such as Roy Jenkins also firmly noted the radical shift in public opinion on the trajectory and object of the war, initiated by the reconfiguration of the government and Churchill's public certainty of British intransigence (even if he privately questioned whether Britain could win). So even factoring out his leadership, his incredible ability to marshall American sympathy toward a foreign cause, his clout with other figures such as Stalin, and his ability to put the right people (including personal enemies) in the right position, we can already just from a two week period see why Charles Krauthammer described him as the 20th century's 'indispensable man'. If in 1940 Germany had had a free hand in Europe, and the option of a single-front war with the USSR without UK/US convoys to arm the Soviet Union whilst it moved its productive capacity behind the Urals, and no means for America to engage in Europe and North Africa, then where would the world be now?

I could point to 1000 other examples from the war as to why Churchill was not only important but indispensable to the war effort, but this response is already growing far too long already. It was important however to demonstrate that your emphatic claim that his contribution was minimal, when it was indispensable, was puerile, ignorant and false. Also at no stage did I say that the allied victory was purely down to Churchill, and you *know* that I didn't. It was down to the valiant effort of millions of people from many countries, and no short amount of luck. However he was an essential figure in winning the war, a point of view so firmly established by historical, military and political analysts as to be as near to immutable as a social science topic can be. Without winning that war none of the good that followed could have happened, he is 'worshipped' because of that fact.

Was he a good peace time leader? Pretty well no, but that in no way diminishes his greatness- after all I'd rather he got WW2 right than anything else. The point you make about the BBC is nonsense- he had a personal feud with Lord Reith, and the two hated each other bitterly. He was arrogant, and felt he deserved more time on BBC radio- I bet he's the only politician that ever complained about that, right? What a tyrant. Or perhaps you are referring to his opening up television to ITV? In which case, I fail to understand your issue there. I assume too that you are referring to the closure of the Daily Worker, and the advent of the Ministry for Information. These weren't personal crusades by Churchill, but the necessary actions of a government engaging in the only total war we as a country have ever known. However by winning the conflict he ensured freedom of speech, assembly and association across Europe. 

And yes, he was a fervent Imperialist. Yes his ideas about race seem to jar to a modern ear- how could a man speak to the US congress about the evil of Nazi 'Dark Ages racial persecution' yet believe in Empire so fervently, and feel such anger to Indian independence? Because he was raised a half English aristocrat in the 19th century. Yes we know better now, to regard his conversation with his Boer prison guard, recorded in *london to ladysmith*, as deeply patronising and prejudiced towards black people- but nobody in this subreddit would have felt anything less repugnant if they were from that time. Indeed, his views were seen as dangerously liberal for his generation:

&gt; ""Is it right,"" the guard asked Churchill, ""that a dirty Kaffir [native] should walk on the pavement [sidewalk] without a pass? That's what they do in your British Colonies. Brother! Equal! Ugh! Free! Not a bit. We know how to treat Kaffirs....They were put here by the God Almighty to work for us. We'll stand no damned nonsense from them. We'll keep them in their proper places.""
&gt; 
&gt; After recording his guard's opinions Churchill states his own: ""What is the true and original root of Dutch aversion to British rule? It is the abiding fear and hatred of the movement that seeks to place the native on a level with the white man. British government is associated in the Boer farmer's mind with violent social revolution...the Kaffir is to be declared the brother of the European, to be constituted his legal equal, to be armed with political rights...nor is a tigress robbed of her cubs more furious than is the Boer at this prospect."" After the statements of his captor, Churchill concludes, ""[he and I had] no more agreement...Probing at random I had touched a very sensitive nerve.""
&gt; 

So yes, in many ways to us he was incredibly illiberal and contradictory- he felt that the British Empire was the means by which liberal values and liberty were spread, rather than an obstacle, as we now know it to be, and a tool for 'elevating' other races to legal equality with 'the white man'. But the world we know was *built* upon the one he secured. The values he spoke about and helped secure in the war, and codified in international treaty and law post 1945 ,informed and helped shape those we have now- we wouldn't even be having this argument if he hadn't lived.

So that is why he's admired, despite HUGE imperfections, HUGE character weaknesses- and I have a problem with people such as yourself, who will adapt hearsay or google the odd tidbit, without actually knowing what you are talking about, in order to then disdain those who do admire him. He did a damn sight more for the human race than you and I will ever, ever do.

The irony.

&gt; you have turned a genuine conversation into a bitter argument

Part of why I'm finding you so funny is because you're taking this so seriously, and I just don't give a shit. Lighten up!

&gt; I bet you didn't even watch that match. And if you did, you haven't re-watched it again. Stop lying

I just cannot - I love this entire angle. I actually had to stop at this point to laugh out loud. Brilliant.

Also I have confirmed I have not since re-watched the match in its entirety (why on earth would I want to watch United win the European Cup?) - though I have since re-watched the penalty shootout in an attempt to corroborate your claims. They were not corroborated. 

Tip: being a football fan is not about how often you re-watch matches. That is not the essence of it at all. I'm making a serious point here because I think you need to be told, as this appears to be the impression you are under.

&gt; I have recorded that match and i still have it with me

Highlight of the comment - how do you have it with you? Do you literally have it on a memory stick or something, that you carry on a chain around your neck? Or were you being figurative? Is it etched into your heart? 

&gt; Making a mockery out of the whole conversation

Yes, yes I am. Specifically, I am mocking *you*. You should try it some time, everyone loves a bit of self-deprecation. 

&gt; It is really hard to deal with pretentious people like you

It takes some practice, but you'll get there.

&gt; Stop talking about you being drunk. I don't give a fuck

Why do you keep talking about me being drunk? I mentioned it in passing (whilst drunk, I should add) in order to take the piss out of you, and you keep banging on about it. It's really not a big deal, adults do drink from time to time. Move on!

&gt; what has Sala got to do with this conversation?

Because we were discussing the devastating effect JT's tears had on the team's morale, and I was just singling Kalou out for especial praise, as he was able to overcome the sight of his traumatised captain. 

Also, I am still curious about why you have failed to provide any evidence to facilitate this discussion? I have given you several opportunities to do so, and yet you keep declining. We cannot continue a serious discussion until you do so.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Given that I've got to be up in seven hours, I'll be brief - more in-depth response to follow, if required.

&gt;But think of the amount of volunteers around the country who'd be happy to check, catalogue and even digitise such books. All they need is libraries to keep the bleeding lights on.

Source? I highly doubt there's a plethora of people out there - be they appropriately skilled [I'll come to that in a moment] or not, who're prepared to volunteer. This army of volunteers notion is one of the central conceits of the PMs ""Big Society"" - a plan so inept and full of BS, it makes Iain Duncan Smith look competent by comparison.

But let's go off on a limb and assume that there *are* enough people wishing to volunteer their time and energy, to digitalise a series of books that have been discarded, and deemed surplus to requirements, not only by the people who donated them to charity shops, but also the patrons of said shops, and indeed, the staff.

[It's worth perhaps pointing out here that Google - an organisation with more resources and finances than some EU countries, are already attempting to do this - digitising books. They're not exactly proceeding at a record pace.]

How would it be done? And who'd pay for the cost. You need appropriate scanning equipment - a bog standard scanner isn't going to be upto scratch, as anyone familiar with professional book scanning hardware can attest. Then you need OCR software.

Which isn't perfect. You'd need someone to proof read the output. Which necessitates yet more resources being used - namely, the time it takes for someone to read the output.

So at this point, let's examine the resources / steps taken.

* Physically drive to a charity shop, pick up 15KG of discarded books.
* Take them to a central location [I'll address this more in reply to your second paragraph], where they're assessed for suitability for digitalisation.
* Scan the books using equipment that decidedly *isn't* off the shelf.
* Check the output.

There are additional steps, however they're perhaps best addressed in response to your second paragraph:

&gt;All donated books would stay local. No need for major sorting operations. After digitisation, rare books could be auctioned on ebay or whatever.

That would introduce a huge additional cost. Centralised processing exists for a reason, namely to reduce cost, and wastage.

In order for it to be even remotely feasible, they'd be sent to a central processing ""hub"" - in much the same way as every authority has ""main"" or ""Central"" libraries, and a collection of local branch libraries, the same would happen here - they'd be sent to a location for processing. Perhaps the same ""Main"" libraries, or at recycling facilities.

Think about it. If Dudley, Netherton, Stourbridge, and Brierly Hill libraries - three libraries within ten miles of each other, all pick up the same book from different shops, how much of a waste of resources would it be for all four libraries to attempt to digitalise it?

It'd make more sense - barely more sense, as the entire idea you're espousing is a non-starter - for it to be centralised.

There's another reason it'd need to be centralised - legality. Odds are if a book donated to a charity shop has fallen out of copyright, a digitalised copy will already exist, via Project Gutenberg.

If it doesn't? How does a librarian  - or whoever is in charge of overseeing the digitalisation process, know they actually have the legal footing to scan it? Just today the copyright laws on music were extended by twenty years -&gt; http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/5778104/uk-extends-recording-copyright-term-from-50-to-70-years-adds-artist

Hopefully by this point you're beginning to appreciate the significant amount of resources required - time, money, etc. etc. in order to even begin to make this a feasible idea.

&gt;As for declining library membership, there have never been so many people with nothing/little to do Mon-Fri. All that's needed is promotion and new ideas.

I never said libraries were experiencing declining membership levels. Certainly there are some reports that they are. But there are even more that say visitor numbers are booming. I'd argue in favour of the latter, particularly with reforms to the welfare system. Speaking of which....

&gt;...there have never been so many people with nothing/little to do Mon-Fri.

But *make anything*? Why not simply use them to create new Time Lords? Can it create souls? Why not go to that room any time he needs to defeat an enemy? I need a giant laser gun to destroy the Dalek Senate. Let me just pop down to the giant omnipotent replicator.

One thing is very important to note - the stuff on which Theresa May makes shit up do not qualify for 'things which are irrelevent [sic] and don't matter' - the Human Rights Act, Britain's membership of the European Court of Human Rights and human rights law in general are areas of massive importance. Theresa May, more than any other Home Secretary before, is actively trying to dismantle the Human Rights Act and is doing so by lying to the public in the process.

&gt;She has to pretend to be anti-immigration while ensuring that we get as much labour in as possible to help the economy as much as possible.

How do you know she's only pretending? It seems to me like you're projecting your own political views onto Theresa May - if she says she's hardline on immigration, take her at her word. Anyway, who cares if she's pro-immigration in private and actually feels gosh darn awful about the anti-immigration policies she enacts? If she does it, then I don't care if she sighs and furrows her brow behind closed doors - she still did it.

&gt;The people she seems like a complete moron to are the people who actually understand european law, but there are exceptionally few of them and they are a statistical irrelevance.

By this argument no technical, expert opinion is relevant whatsoever. Of course, the opinions of experts are going to be a statistical minority, but that's not the point. I'm not a technocrat that thinks only lawyers should be Home Secretary, but the point is that people who actually understand the subjects she's talking about know that she straight up lies about things on which there is no factual dispute to be had (again: see catgate). There are other Tory politicians who don't resort to these sorts of tactics, Theresa May has made a deliberate choice to sit on the right wing of the Tory party on this issue, and she should be called out for it.

&gt;Not since James Callahan has a Home Secretary become Prime Minister. The fact people are even thinking of her is a massive achievement given the role she is playing.

Honestly, the only person who should really find this relevant is Theresa May herself and her friends and family. As a voter and a taxpayer I don't give two shits how ambitious and crafty she is as a political game player, I'm just interested in what her policies are and her affect on the country as a whole.",0,1384217886,null,0,false,0,cdc62o5,t3_1qdiwb,t1_cdc62o5,t1_cdc3gwr,null,1428697556,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Terrorism is everything.

Nowadays you don't have to commit any crime to be penalised for it. You just have to be considered a bit unsavoury.

&gt;[Lists being made of people who attend protests](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/11/domestic-extremist-police-databases)

And if you go to protests or rallies or get stop-and-searched once, the police consider you a bit unsavoury and add you to their database as a domestic extremist.

&gt;[preemptive arrests before thatcher funeral](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cops-plan-dawn-raids-ahead-1832813)

And if you might disrupt a flag-waving event you'll be raided and detained for the duration.

Arrest or punishment without a crime having been committed is now an established trend in UK law. This is just another expansion of it.

People might be 'afraid of irritating teens', but criminalising 'being annoying' is.. well kinda worse. And people's fear of crime is massively overinflated compared to *actual* crime rates.

Finally;

&gt;we all know these laws are targeted at groups of feral chav scum

Right. But this law doesn't apply to just them, does it. And if you're reporting them for hanging out and (in your opinion) looking menacing, they can report you for walking past them glaring angrily.

&gt;No police will waste their time listening to the complaints of the scum

Using their handy MAGICAL PEOPLE JUDGEOMETERS the police will filter out complaints from 'scum' to be ignored. Not you, though. You're superior. When the police use the JUDGEOMETER on you, it will merely dispense tea and biscuits.

You sound like you've had trouble with annoying chavs. That's understandably annoying. I don't think it justifies laws that allow people to be arrested without actually doing anything. There are already laws in place to deal with people being a nuisance - laws that require the accused to at least have *done something wrong* before they can be arrested.

It isn't the fact that we lose or draw a game we should win. It's the fact that we do it by playing so damn horribly. WBA outplayed us so hard. They fought hard and we didn't. The past few games have shown a recurring problem that we have yet to see rectified (starting lampard), among other problems that have come and gone. Personally I don't question us winning the season after games like WBA and newcastle, but I do question how much of a struggle it will be. If we can't be consistent then the risk of losing first place or even the top 4 spots is much much higher. And by consistent I don't mean in winning, I mean in the level of our play. If we had played well against WBA less people would be complaining, and the criticism would be much more constructive. But we made horrible mistakes, lost almost every header, and (like the newcastle game) didn't really give effort until we were down 1-0. These problems are real.

Sure Suarez scores headers but minus the absurd 18 yarder against WBA, most are flicks off deep crosses or great positioning leaving him an easy headed finish. He is not one to out-jump a CB, but his positioning and awareness allow him to score headed goals.

I think you could say Sturridge's weakness is his aerial game, he's not a great header of the ball and his goal against Sunderland (I think, maybe CP?) was actually his arm. Even his goal against Man U was right place right time, it didn't come from attacking (or Skrteling, as I like to call it) a corner. 

That all being said the point I'm making is that Henderson doesn't need to be a great crosser of the ball for him to be a massive influence for us. One, I don't think he's a wide player and even though he didn't cut inside frequently, ultimately his best position will be through the middle. However, because he's linked so well with Glen, I could see him playing there frequently for us. Second, our game does not rely on scoring goals from balls into the box from wide positions.

The practice of paying royalties to TV writers for the use of their creations in future productions is certainly newer than that (and possibly unique to the WGA).

A good example of this practice is the character of Doyle on *Angel*. It was originally intended that Angel's demon sidekick would be a character named Whistler, first introduced in an episode of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.

When changing gear, you can 'blip' the throttle, basically matching the engine speed with the speed of the rear wheel so the gear slots in nicely. It takes some practice but is relatively easy once you get used to it.

Videos like this can show it:

Bump starting...

The way I've done it is to get off the bike, and put it in 2nd gear. Then hold the clutch in and run with the bike. Jump on the bike whilst it is moving and then let the clutch out. The engine will start.

It is easier down a hill because you can jump on as it rolls.

I'm not saying Austin is bad, just that every time Johnson comes on the pitch, he has an effect on the game.  Getting in behind defenders, making chances, getting off shots.  Just look at this, http://youtu.be/d27qzTYUUvw?t=1m26s.  We need this guy healthy.

Onuoha too, class defender.  Really missed his impact over the past few weeks.  Glad he's back, should really lift us up.  Big, strong defender, exactly what we need.

Matty Phillips, another player who I think has the potential to really make a difference in the squad.  Had a huge impact two games back, creating chances, cutting in, fantastic.

I think that Diakite should be given a chance, Mali international - could really spark his career up again.  Hopefully with all these injuries he could get a chance.  Get back in with the first team, give us another option at midfielder.

Tom Carroll too, need him back.  Nothing better than the creativity and passion of a midfielder just starting down his professional path.

Worst injury we have is probably Hoilett and Faurlin.  Both huge players, more so Faurlin than Hoilett in my opinion.  Hoilett is a good lad, lacks a finishing touch is all.  I'm a Canadian though, so I love him anyway.  Frustrating to watch sometimes, hehe.  Faurlin though, his absence will be sorely missed.

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; My knowledge of this particular period is not fantastic, but I think to characterise the Irish as ""one people"" is probably a bit generous. As far as I can recollect throughout Europe local ties at this point were far more important than national ones (and indeed most nationalist theories trace its real routes to 18th century

My definition of 'one people' (before as you said the advent of nationalism) involves: shared economy, shared language, shared culture, shared religion, shared laws, shared political system (the system, while not applying singular power all over the Gaelic lands, was at least the same over all of the Gaelic lands; a larger scale version would be seen in the Holy Roman Empire where the German Emperor gained power from *loyalty* rather than any 'national' right), shared ethnicity, and shared culture and mythology. All of this applies to the pre-Norman Gaels. In fact, it seems to applies much moreso than any modern concept of ""British"" - Anglo-Saxon-Dano-Norman-Picto-Gael-Briton(-Desi?-Carib?).

&gt; I know enough about the highkingship to realise that it was not capable of uniting Ireland against a foreign aggressor.

That was essential what it was *for*. While it was hardly ever pressed into use when it was largely held by the Ua Neill (in what would become Northern Ireland; the reason for the special planting of Northern Ireland is that this was the seat of strongest Irish power), it was taken by Brian Boru of Munster who used it to fight the Battle of Clontarf, crushing a rebellion that would have resulted in Vikings from Dublin and Orkney having claims of highkingship. The issue that led to the first successful invasion was that one side of one of these civil wars, upon realising he was to lose everything, called in the Normans, pledging loyalty to them instead. It's key to note that this was given the blessing of the only ever English pope, who granted Henry II the right to Invasion of ""the barbarous nation of Ireland"" - recognition of such from an enemy should mean something. 

Even if this were not the case, the successful invasions of Britain in 43AD (Roman), the 400s (Anglo-Saxon), the 500s (Dal Riada) 865 (Danelaw), 1066 (Norman) and 1688 (Orange) hardly indicate that the Britons were not a single people.

&gt; I'd heard otherwise, but if you are sure I'll have to yield to you.

I am absolutely sure. A British citizen is neither (excepting other normal circumstances) entitled to Irish citizenship nor can vote. He's evidently welcome to play for our soccer team if he's got a ""green granny"" though! [Andy Townsend was the first Englishman to dye leading Ireland](http://www.footballtop.com/sites/default/files/styles/player_full/public/photos/players/kernozenko_content_2.jpg?itok=6afPI2__).

&gt; Can we compromise at ""the British and Irish Isles""?

true,Fireburner_,lfc99,,"&gt; Steven Gerrard pauses as he considers the question. The subject of caps has come up and he is contemplating his position in England’s all-time list.

&gt;Sandwiched between Bobby Moore and Sir Bobby Charlton on 107 appearances, and within touching distance of David Beckham and Peter Shilton, Gerrard has an opportunity to become the most capped player in England’s history.

&gt;To do that, though, would mean prolonging his international career, which started 13 years ago against Ukraine. Yet only last week Brendan Rodgers intimated that Gerrard’s involvement with England will end at the close of next summer’s World Cup finals in Brazil.

&gt; So what does his future hold?  Gerrard has a dream about England but it has little to do with personal gain. All decisions about retirement will remain on hold as he sets about trying to realise the vision that has been in his mind since he charged the length of Wembley to secure the trip to Brazil.

&gt;‘107 caps isn’t bad for someone who isn’t “a top, top player”, is it?’ he says with a telling smile. ‘I never expected to get that amount of caps. When I made my debut, I set myself the personal target of trying to get 50 caps and score 10 goals if I could. So to have 107 is something I am really proud of, particularly being among those names. 

&gt;‘I’m not looking at Shilton or Beckham. Passing Bobby Moore would be the next one. To go past him, after everything he did, would be unbelievable. But the dream would be to come away from a  tournament and everyone back home is proud of the team.

&gt;‘To be clapped home would be amazing. But it will only happen if we go past the quarter-final. It is not about me passing Bobby Moore, Peter Shilton or David Beckham. To think about that would be very self-centred. I am not that type of person. 

&gt;‘For me the ambition is this: can I help get the team past a quarter-final? I haven’t really thought about what I will do after the World Cup. It is all about going to enjoy this World Cup. What an experience it will be in Brazil. I am absolutely delighted to help the team get there, it was a great achievement. But now the attention has to switch to: what can we do there?’

&gt;We meet on a quiet Monday morning at Liverpool’s Melwood training retreat. It is in moments like these you see why the claim Sir Alex Ferguson made in his autobiography - that he was one of the few who thought ‘Gerrard was not a top, top player’ - is so perplexing

&gt;Gerrard has no wish to become embroiled in a war of words, nor does he want to dwell on the subject. There is little doubt, however, the phrase has left him puzzled, not least because Ferguson made a strong attempt to sign him in the summer of 2004.

&gt;‘Listen, he’s entitled to his  opinion,’ says Gerrard. ‘I’m a fan of his; he is one of the best managers in the world. I won’t lose any sleep over it. Throughout my career I have had praise from all types of people - including him - and I am not vain enough to take it all. I have had some unbelievable praise from him and he tried to buy me, certainly on one occasion. Maybe even two.

&gt;‘For me, the most important thing is what Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson are thinking. I think they are really pleased with me and that is all I will worry about.’

&gt;Rodgers has given his squad the day off yet Gerrard has still chosen to report for work. He is the only one to have done so. A session in the swimming pool, followed by another in the gym helps ensure he can recover quickly from the rigours of the Premier League.

&gt;He turns 34 next May but, some stiffness in his hip apart, Gerrard’s physical condition has arguably never been better, while off the field being the father of three young girls provides the perfect antidote to the pressures of captaining club and country.

&gt;‘I’m managing myself very well on and off the pitch,’ says Gerrard. ‘I have got a fantastic medical team around me. I’ve always said if I can get my body right and be healthy, I can cope with Liverpool and England, no problem. 

&gt;‘With experience of football and life, you learn to handle things. You know you can cope with the defeats and the bad performances. 

&gt;‘When I go home, I can totally switch off if I want. When I go through the door, I have to switch into Mickey Mouse world for the youngest (Lourdes), or dancing for the other two (Lilly-Ella and Lexie).

&gt;When I leave the car park at Melwood, I try and become a completely different person. I try to get away from it. You have got to. Otherwise you end up like Jamie Carragher - obsessed!’

&gt;The retirement of his great friend has taken some getting used to but there is no sense he feels on his own. If anything, he is still the man who pulls everything together. 

&gt;Providing ammunition for Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge keeps a zest to his game and his importance to this current Liverpool side was underlined by the ovation he received after conjuring three assists in the 4-0 battering of Fulham.

&gt;‘It’s a dream, an absolute dream,’ is the explanation of finding harmony with Liverpool’s front pair. ‘I have always played with one top forward through my career here. Now there are two main men and it is great. I will be honest and say that at the start, I wasn’t sure whether it would work. But it has clicked without much work in training. I’m excited as I think it can get better.

&gt;‘Daniel has grown as a player. He has been great for Liverpool but Liverpool have been great for him. If he keeps listening to the right people, he can improve.’ 

&gt;Should Sturridge need an example of the rewards that hard work reaps, he should look at his captain. Never mind the 107 caps, the 10 major honours, the 643 Liverpool appearances. The next test is all that matters to Gerrard and Brazil 2014 will offer the biggest challenge of all.

&gt;‘I think there is a lot more realism now,’ says Gerrard. ‘Nobody is blowing us up to be something we are not. That has helped the team. 

&gt;‘The expectations aren’t crazy, it is realistic. We are not one of the favourites but if we go there and it clicks, who knows?’",0,1384227260,null,0,false,0,cdca0xj,t3_1qfhvy,t1_cdca0xj,t3_1qfhvy,null,1428695641,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18

Paulinho and Dembele on the pitch at the same time makes no sense and essentially gives the opposition one less threat to worry about as Paulinho and Dembele both struggle to transition from defense to offense rapidly.  For me, our best 11 right now are:

Lloris, Walker, Kaboul, Chirches, Verts (Rose if he ever gets healthy - move Verts to center), Sandro, Paulinho, Eriksen, Lamela, Townsend, and Soldado.

You should make VLC your default video player for everything. It's fantastic. Leaps and bounds better than Windows Media player (or what ever macs have).

Now, download AceStream from-

http://www.acestream.org/

Make sure you uncheck the toolbars on installation, they can be a bitch.

Next, make sure you get a pretty blank screen. It should look like a default VLC player with no video.

After that, I personally use [WizWig.tv](http://www.wiziwig.tv/competition.php?discipline=football&amp;part=sports). When you find the game you want to watch, click on it.

Now, in the middle you should see something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/9dgylOx.png). You can click on ""all software"" and then sort by Acestream. You'll need to click where it says URL and copy it.

Now go back into AceStream. Go top left, and go to media. You should see something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/tWdPGir.png). Go to ""AceStream Content ID"".  Simply paste the URL where you are prompted. It'll take a bit to get started, but should be good sailing from there.

Pros: Gorgeous, intimate and safe campus next to a gorgeous, intimate and safe city. Student's Union was fairly priced for food and drink when I was there (massive Full English for only 4 quid!). 70:30 girl to guy ratio when I was there (and mostly attractive drama students.)

Cons: Absolutely appalling administration (colloquially known as being ""Bath Spa'd"") coupled with the reputation of being a mediocre liberal arts university means that if your course isn't a PGCE or taught at Sion Hill, you're completely wasting your time. Sadly this attitude filters down to the student body after the first month and they become very lackadaisical and disengaged so conversation isn't particularly stimulating but hey ho, I'm a snob on such matters. Bath is also pretty expensive to live in.

I should visit more places in the UK but I feel confident in declaring Bath is the best city in the UK. Arty, affluent, beautiful, lots going on (or near to other places with lots going on), it feels like a place you can completely unwind in and despite my earlier negative statement about the high cost of living, it's doable to work a minimum wage job and live in Bath (you just need an enormous slice of fortune when looking for leases).

My cousin went to school in similar circumstances. The school he went to was in Leicester in the mid 80's, and he was one of only two white kids in his year.

He got bullied quite badly (he also wore very thick glasses, which didn't help matters), but was never pressured to change religion I don't think.


It was mostly a Hindu/Sikh school at the time. There were over 4x less Muslims in the UK at the time so this may be different today. So yeah, I wouldn't have thought that it's a Muslim vs non-Muslim thing. More like kids being kids and picking on those that are different.


Back then, schools really didn't do *anything* to try and tackle bullying (over race or any other reason). I hate to say it, but I believe he ended up just getting really good at fighting.

On the bright side. Somehow he didn't end up growing up to be a massive racist ...unlike a lot of people from my school (which was predominantly white).

Hopefully things have moved on since he went to school, and schools &amp; teachers are better equipped to handle bullying nowadays.

true,BangsNaughtyBits,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"   Frankly, the Doctor never had a clean regeneration after the first regeneration until the Fifth Doctor regenerated into the Sixth.

   The Time Lords forced the Second Doctor's regeneration.

   The Third Doctor's regeneration was triggered by an outside entity and not self initiated.  Whether that was because he was incapable of regeneration himself at that point or if it was an explicate push to get it rolling more quickly/smoothly is a somewhat open question

   The Fourth Doctor didn't cleanly regenerate, either.  He sort of merged with a sentient being. ""*The moment has been prepared for.*"" He merged with a pseudo Doctor or a sentient manifestation of the regeneration energy or so I had believed.

   Then there is the Tenth's aborted regeneration and the Eleventh's donor regeneration from River.

   Frankly, the Time Lords really need to invest in improved hospice care.  Their standard of care is all over the place.

Pros: 

- London (fantastic city)
- excellent reputation. If you have the desire to break into consulting or banking you are well placed
- fantastic elective options. Some really interesting modules to chose from
- you'll make a fantastic network
- teachers really know their stuff (expanded in the cons section)
- it is very academically driven. You won't get an easy ride, but you'll learn a lot


Cons:

- London is expensive
- an incredibly high number of international students. Not a bad thing in itself per se, but it is noticeable.
- the teachers are excellent at their field, and most of them have real world experience, however some seem a lot more focussed on their research than teaching
- there is a certain ""sink or swim"" mentality if you aren't proactive, you won't get the help.

We could both see that breastfeeding was not working out, yet my wife would not give in as though somehow it made her feel inferior as a woman. I said to her my thoughts and I will never forget the look of relief in her eyes. We went to bottle feeding, and whilst expensive it worked out fine.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"It doesn't work for Liverpool. They were found out hard by Arsenal and lost just as much for tactical reasons as for footballing reasons, BR had to revert the 3 at the back early in the match. Against smaller teams, Liverpool were just outscoring opponents because they had Sturridge - Suarez up front, we have no player of Suarez calibre so can't rely on banging in 2-3 goals a game. I would say it fails for Liverpool because they don't have true wing backs nor a great DM pairing to shield the three. 

The formation has worked for Barcelona at times because they have so much more quality than many of their opponents. You need a Busquets or Shweinsteiger (world class DM) to truly shield the 3. In fact, I think Bayern could probably pull it off, but they are already successful as is. 

3-5-2 suits Juve because of the players they had (again, notice it working with the team in the league that has the best players), they were very heavy in midfield (much like us) and also had a striker issue (much like us). It made sense to go top heavy to make the most of their powerful midfield. Spurs strongest asset right now is a near impenetrable defence, it doesn't make sense to sacrifice that. I know many other Serie A teams have adopted the 3-5-2 now, but I don't think they have been doing it for long enough (Juve are a year ahead) to draw conclusions yet, they also have had at least one x-fer window to bring in players that fit that system.

I would also note a fundamental flaw for the 3-5-2 when against the very popular 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 seen in the EPL. If the team using one of the these strategies can commit the 3-5-2 wingbacks (say have Lennon and Townsend attacking wide) then you force the 3-5-2 to be more of a 5-3-2, which lacks the ability to push forward as you now have 5 attackers against 7 or so defenders. This was well illustrated in the recent Madrid vs Juve game. In the first half Madrid tried to slog through the middle and got burned by superior numbers (Pirlo/Pogba mainly), in the second half Ancelotti made Madrid use Bale and Ronaldo in wide areas leading to two very quick goals. 

To entertain the notion of a 3-5-2 you would need:

                        Lloris

             Kaboul - Chiriches - Vertonghen

      Walker   -       Capoue          -       Rose

           Paulinho       -          Eriksen
                    
                   Lamela

                            Soldado


That is what I see as spurs best attempt at 3-5-2. We don't have the wingbacks (Lennon can't defend well enough, Siggurdson not fast enough, perhaps Chadli) to pull it off. ",0,1384248795,null,0,false,0,cdcfzt7,t3_1qd246,t1_cdcfzt7,t1_cdce30a,null,1428692784,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,JRugman,null,null,"Oh come on. There's some huge holes in the proposal that the official brochure unsurprisingly completely glosses over.

1. Does the £47 billion cost and 7 year construction period include the delivery and operation of all the high speed rail lines and central London terminals that are neccessary to keep the airport running? (answer - no)

2. The developers propose that the £45 billion value of the old Heathrow airport site be 'partially captured', but don't suggest how this would be done.

3. Similarly with the creation of a new London Borough - unless anyone's forgotten, Heathrow is already located in the borough of Hillingdon, which would presumably be against the loss of any of its territory.

4. What kind of time frame is suggested for the redevelopment of the old Heathrow airport site, which is meant to provide housing for 300,000 people and 200,000 jobs? Consider that the airport currently provides 136,600 direct and indirect jobs in London, which would all be either lost or relocated at great expense. Consider also that previous estimates of the development potential of the Heathrow site have been much lower (80,000 homes / 43,500 jobs according to TfL).

5. Do they seriously expect 80 million passengers per year and a hundred thousand or so workers to all travel to the airport by rail? That would mean building a rail line with a capacity more than double the busiest line that currently operates - double decker high speed trains running every 5-10 mins. You're also talking about feeding almost all these passengers straight into Kings Cross or Crossrail, which will struggle to cope with the extra traffic. 

6. According to the National Air Traffic Services, an estuary airport would result in more planes flying at a lower altitude over central London, since they'd be heading east on take-off and would need to avoid the airspace of other London airports. It would also mean landing approaches being pushed eastwards into Dutch and Belgian airspace, who would probably want to reserve it for their own airports. Even if they were open to the idea, diverting the main flightpaths serving northwest europe would result in an increase in fuel use and emissions by airlines using them.

7. If the main goal is to reduce noise suffered by residents under the Heathrow flight path, then for £50 billion you could buy out and rehouse everyone inside the 57dB noise contour, unifying Windsor Great Park, Hounslow Heath, Osterley Park, Kew Gardens, Gunnersbury Park, Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common … if not further into London … as a nature reserve.

The main question that needs to be resolved is whether London even needs a hub airport. Other airports in europe are geographically better placed to receive air traffic from growing BRICS economies, so if you're talking about competition with europe then we're always going to lose out. We've benefitted from the access to US markets, for which London is much better placed than any other major EU city (Eire excepted).

The main beneficiaries of an expanded hub airport serving London would be the owners of the airport (which may, like Heathrow, be as much a foreign-owned mechanism for tax avoidance as it is a place for people to fly to other countries) and the major airlines serving long-haul routes. The problem with trying to capture a share of a global market is that the companies involved are likely to be based outside the UK, so the economic benefit to the UK may end up being marginal.

How much faith do we have in the projections of massively increasing demand for air travel over the next 50-100 years? Given the constraints on fuel and space that may be faced, is it not better to add capacity incrementally (which is a clear possibility at Gatwick and Stansted), and focus our national infrastructure planning on projects that actually serve the people of the UK?",0,1384251057,null,0,false,0,cdcgb4q,t3_1qe77v,t1_cdcgb4q,t1_cdbzv67,null,1428692638,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Frap_Gadz,eng-eastsusex,We Wunt Be Druv,"It really annoys me when the media confuse ""breastfeeding"" with ""feeding with breast milk"" in these headlines/stories.

My understanding is that the general consensus among the published scientific literature is that breast milk is better than artificially produced milk. My understanding is that these studies don't usually differentiate between the delivery method.

More to the point I think a move like this one would be discriminatory, there are women who can't (for whatever medical or personal reasons) produce milk and therefore are excluded from feeding with breast milk by necessity rather than choice. Clearly a move like this would discriminate unfairly against those women.

I think that the UK medical profession needs to re-evaluate their message about ""breast is best"" to remove the confusion that seems to permeate their ranks (from my personal experience) about the difference between breast milk vs formula and the bottle vs breast debate, as they're completely different. Moreover they need to understand that, while they may be under pressure to increase the number of women feeding their babies using breast milk, they must remain sensitive to the specifics of the individual cases and not place undue pressure or stress on those who don't have a choice.

Regardless of all this, and whether scientific evidence suggests that breast milk is best, we can't loose sight of the fact that this is a choice (if they have the option) the parents have to make.

No, I haven't said that piracy is theft. I think it's the incorrect term in both instances.

&gt;if a member of a public that would have only pirated your work doesn't listen to your music at all?

What does that have to do with anything at all?

&gt;After all they are still choosing not to pay for your music, taking money away from you that they might have paid if something was different, and the only impact the lack of piracy has had on you is simply that one less person has heard it.

Under what circumstances are people downloading very specific music in order to not listen to it? 

&gt;For example what if this person can only buy one album a month and they decide they would prefer to buy some one else's album instead of yours? Are you being stolen from? After all they might have chosen to buy your album if that other album hadn't existed!

And for good reason.  If you tell them you might be late they'll want to know why, if you tell them you have a job interview they'll want to know where and demand contact details.  Then they phone the place to confirm.  They make it exceptionally clear that they are the JCP, the person being interviewed is on JSA, roughly how long you've been on JSA and that you are, quite obviously, currently unemployed. 

Sounds fair enough doesn't it?  They need to make sure you're being honest.  But then you have to add-in the possibility that someone within the hiring chain at that place has the ""fuck the scroungers"" attitude, it is and always has been quite a common attitude after all.

&gt; Your gran dies during the night. The next morning your partner calls the job centre and asks if you can come in the following day instead. The centre agrees, and you sign in the next day. Then you get a letter stating that you failed to sign in and would be sanctioned if you don’t reply within seven days. You reply, explaining the situation. The job centre gives you a six-week sanction for not replying.

Sounds like a failing with the JC not updating their records. Every time I called I would ask for the persons name, write down what was discussed, then at the end of the call ask them to make a note on my account to state what we'd discussed. 

&gt; You get a job interview. It’s at the same time as your job centre appointment, so you reschedule the job centre. You attend your rearranged appointment and then get a letter saying your benefits will be stopped because going to a job interview isn’t a good enough reason to miss an appointment.

I think what actually happened here was the applicant provided no evidence of attending an interview. Normally the evidence is sent off to a person who will decide if it is proof enough of your interview, if not, sanctions. 

&gt; You’ve signed in on time, been to interviews and applied for work. Your job centre advisor suggests you make a two-line change to your CV, which you do, but fail to give the updated CV to the job centre (you weren’t told you had to). You are sanctioned for four weeks.

This is newish rule &amp; should have been explained better by the JC. It is suggested that any time you attend you take your latest cv with you, which would have solved this problem. 

&gt; You work for 20 years and then miss a job centre appointment because you haven’t had the process clearly explained. You are sanctioned for 3 weeks.

I do believe this is a failing on both the JC for not checking if the applicant had understood fully, but also the applicant for not reading fully the information given to them by the JC. 


&gt; You get a job that starts in two weeks time. You don’t look for work while you are waiting for the job to start. You’re sanctioned.

You are still in receipt of benefit, so your original agreement is still in place. 

&gt; You are forced to retire due to a heart condition, and you claim Employment and Support Allowance. During your assessment you have a heart attack. You are sanctioned for not completing your assessment.

There is a time period in which things must be completed. I'm sure this falls under extenuating circumstances &amp; if explained, with supporting evidence it would have been corrected. 

&gt; It’s Christmas Day and you don’t fill in your job search evidence form to show that you’ve looked for all the new jobs that are advertised on Christmas Day. You are sanctioned. Merry Christmas. 

You agreed to search for X jobs per week, regardless of the date, religious festivals etc. You failed to adhere to the agreement. 



&gt; You are given a training appointment that clashes with your job centre appointment. The job centre is unwilling to rearrange its appointment and tells you to get a letter from the training organisation. The training organisation says it doesn’t provide letters.

An email stating when the training was would have sufficed as proof of attendance. 

&gt; You apply for three jobs one week and three jobs the following Sunday and Monday. Because the job centre week starts on a Tuesday it treats this as applying for six jobs in one week and none the following week. You are sanctioned for 13 weeks for failing to apply for three jobs each week. 

Everything has to be done by the letter in the JC, so the contract you sign &amp; agree to states you will look for X jobs a week, then you must do that. If you break the contract you've agreed to then you get sanctioned. 

&gt; You miss your job centre appointment due to the funeral of a close family relative. You are sanctioned.

This person either did not inform the JC of the funeral, or had other sanctions for similar offences. 


&gt; You’ve been unemployed for seven months and are forced onto a workfare scheme in a shop miles away, but can’t afford to travel. You offer to work in a nearer branch but are refused and get sanctioned for not attending your placement.

This person agreed to do something (attend a work place training) then stopped doing it, which is breaking the agreed to contract. Thus the sanction. 

&gt; You have a job interview which overruns so you arrive at your job centre appointment 9 minutes late. You get sanctioned for a month.

I'm going to call BS on this one. You can be still seen if you're 10 minutes late at my local JC. If you're any later, they will try &amp; book you another appointment later that day if an advisor is free. 

&gt; You can’t afford to travel to look for work so you get sanctioned.

The job centre reimburses all travel for interviews as long as you provide proof. 

&gt; Your job centre advisor suggests a job. When you go online to apply it says the job has “expired” so you don’t apply. You are sanctioned for 13 weeks.

There is an option at the bottom of each job to state why you didn't reply. Checking ""position is no longer available or relevant to me"" would have solved this. 


&gt; You miss your job centre appointment as it clashes with your work programme interview. You get sanctioned.

The job centre wasn't notified.

Trying to get into conversations is, in my book, a *good* thing and asking a question is far more likely to generate new things to think about than a sterile entry on a website somewhere.

Also, about google: the top results that I get are not necessarily the top results that you get as Google modifies the results based on where you are and what you have searched for in the past.  When I google ""moment of silence"" my top results are:

* Wikipedia entry on moments of silence
* A governor calling for a national moment of silence for Veterans' Day
* A story about every airport security checkpoint in the country shutting down for a moment of silence for the TSA officer who was killed a few days ago
* An article headlined ""Jets observe moment of silence at morning practice"" that I assumed was about the New York Jets but is actually about some Canadian team.

What is it about American anglophiles that you dislike?  The learning curve that they have?  I'm not sure that I'd call myself an anglophile - there are certainly things from over there that I love (Now Show, News Quiz, British humor, the police force that doesn't do forcible anal probing without even a valid warrant because they claim you clenched your buttocks and triggered a false alert from the drug sniffing dog) but there are certainly things that I absolutely hate as well.

The dislike of the government is almost universal and not really worth discussion beyond forging a common bond - ""you hate your government?  I hate my government too!  Cheers!""

So now, you can charge extra for 2nd class because it's expensive so no one wants to buy it, but it's empty! So it's now valuable! You end up with 60% of people in 3rd class, 40% in 2nd class. So on average the customer experience has gotten worse due to overcrowding and you're charging 40% of people more than before. 

But here's where it gets clever- 3rd class is so packed that the majority of customers have an experience of a horribly crowded train- so you go to the government and say ""We need a 20% rise in price, because the rise in demand means we need to build more infrastructure and buy new trains"".

true,keraneuology,null,null,"&gt; If I walked up to an American on 11th September and asked what was such a big deal about that day then I doubt they'd react well and would be incredibly offended that I didn’t know about their important day.

Actually, not at all: the number of people who were offended that you didn't know about it is probably very, very slim and those types are just disagreeable.  I know a lot of people who are actually offended themselves that 9/11 is such a huge deal - especially people who had family members die on that day in something completely unrelated.  As you get further to the right you run into the people who view 9/11 as the day the government went full psycho.  As you get further to the left you find people who point to 9/11 as proof that the United States sucks and is its own fault that the buildings were attacked.  But I can't think of anybody who would be offended if you asked.

&gt; So it is offensive that you (and I say “you” as in lots of people who do this) can’t be bothered to look something up – especially something that is clearly important/emotive for a lot of people.

The problem with google is that things that are contextual aren't easy to find.  Add to that the personalization - my tops results probably aren't your top results - and coming up with a verified culture-specific result is difficult.  When I google ""moment of silence"" (which was all I had to go on in that post) I get:

* Wikipedia entry in general
* A governor wanting to establish a national moment of silence to Veterans' Day
* Every airport security checkpoint in the country shutting down for a moment of silence over that TSA guy who was killed
* An article about the Jets having a moment of silence during their morning practice - which was about some Canadian team and not the New York Jets
* Another moment of silence for the TSA guy
* A moment of silence organization to honor Steve Jobs

Then three more hits about the moment of silence for the TSA guy.

So without my knowing which dots to connect my google search isn't going to help me much.  (By the way, I just did a search for ""moment of silence uk"" and the most prominent hit was something from the Daily Mail: ""'Shame on them': Viewers' outrage as Today show fails to show 9/11 moment of silence... and airs Kris Jenner talking about her breast implants instead"")

But google's failing aside, the entire point is that I wanted to engage in communication with another person, not a sterile website (even if I could find the right one).  The whole point is that I want to interact with *people* who are different than I am because they have their own takes and perspectives that haven't been parsed through an editor before being approved for submission on a website.

&gt; Also if you do lurk on britishproblems then I’m surprised you’ve missed all the 11/11, Poppies and Remembrance Day posts.

I don't really lurk, just skim (but after this I took it off of my subscription list) - I saw the posts about poppies but didn't think anything about it because to me a poppy is just a flower - but ""moment of silence"" is something that we have in common but not nearly on your scale.

&gt; but then you might have been one of many American’s making blasé comments

If I was then I apologize for this was certainly not my angle - clearly my intentions were misinterpreted.  I'll chalk it up to cultural disconnect and leave it at that.",0,1384258371,null,0,false,0,cdchc50,t3_1qejtp,t1_cdchc50,t1_cdch203,null,1428692158,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The problem here is inadequate education. Most people think it's weird to see a baby sucking on a tit. The majority of people I have talked to who don't bf are young and think it is wrong or have been told by their parents that it is weird. These are also the people who never went to an ante-natal class or any groups and weaned at the wrong time because jars of food say from 4 months (even though WHO guidelines state it is best to wait until 6 months), and fed their kids crap. Sweeping generalisation I know, but it's true. 

Also midwives and health visitors need to not be so fucking condescending when it comes to personal choice. I got shouted at at a weighing clinic because my baby had moved from the 75th centile up to just below the 91st as I mentioned I had started feeding my boy finger foods at 5 months.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;No, I haven't said that piracy is theft. I think it's the incorrect term in both instances.

I had to say I read your post wrong, my reply was about laying the ground work for why piracy isn't theft so I can properly explain why these retroactive copyright extensions are. I'll try and straighten that out as we go.  

&gt;What does that have to do with anything at all?

If a person pirates a work or not, it's irrelevant to the person who's work it is unless it's a lost sale. All that happens is that one less person listens to your work. Which brings us to...

&gt;Under what circumstances are people downloading very specific music in order to not listen to it?

I'm not sure I was that unclear here but never the less... In a world in which piracy does not exist the only difference that may make to some one who's work is being pirated is that less people access it. That's it. It's perfectly possible for the existence of piracy or not to have no impact on a content creator. Unlikely sure but possible. I'm sure you can agree that this is different to us losing access to another 20 years of public domain works. 

&gt;Again, I haven't said that piracy is theft. However, what in gods name are you on about? What has a competitive marketplace got to do with piracy or copyright?

Again we are still on illustrations of the problems of relating piracy to theft. Calling piracy theft requires that you presume that a potential sale that isn't made is taking money out of your pocket. In a completive marketplace that happens all the time. In terms of the work going in to the public domain we *have* lost that work from the public domain because of this change. Which brings us to this

&gt;Correct.

So you agree that can't account for piracy but would you say we can't account for the work that is now not going to be part of the public domain? It is after all something that was *provably* going to be happen to a know set of works which now no longer is. It's not a potential loss, it's an actual one.

&gt;Which I haven't.

Which I've admitted.

&gt;Yeah, I guess if you're making 2 million sales you probably don't give a shit about the piracy. If you're an independent record label trying to sell 200 in your spare time then it matters a bit more.

Doesn't change the facts which you just admitted are correct. Appealing to emotions about small independent label has nothing to do with that. Any loss to piracy unaccountable regardless of who or what you are.

So in short you agree piracy is an unquantifiable loss that can't be accounted for and as such isn't theft. What exactly about the quantifiable loss of works that *would unquestionably* have entered the public domain under the terms of the laws under which they where created makes them no longer entering the domain under those terms not equatable to theft? 

The *right* to copy a work can be stolen because it can be given and taken away from a person or people. In this case it is being stolen from us and it's being done through retroactive law making.

Edit:Nm they do report images. 

&gt;IWF's core function is to provide an internet Hotline for the public to report their accidental exposure to criminal online content within our remit and as the national 'notice and takedown' body for that content so  it is quickly removed from circulation. We consider removal at source to be the most effective way of combating child sexual abuse images online and other criminal content within our remit which has been almost eradicated from UK networks.

&gt;We also work internationally to remove child sexual abuse images from the internet by passing details of every identified non-UK website to our partner Hotline in that country so they can investigate it within their own legislation and in cooperation with their national law enforcement agencies.

&gt;Whilst steps to have that content removed are in progress, the UK internet industry has voluntarily agreed to block access to them using a list provided by the IWF. We consider blocking to be a short-term disruption tactic which can help protect internet users from stumbling across these images, whilst processes to have them removed are instigated.

&gt;IWF's core function is to provide an internet Hotline for the public to report their accidental exposure to criminal online content within our remit and as the national 'notice and takedown' body for that content so  it is quickly removed from circulation. We consider removal at source to be the most effective way of combating child sexual abuse images online and other criminal content within our remit which has been almost eradicated from UK networks.

&gt;We also work internationally to remove child sexual abuse images from the internet by passing details of every identified non-UK website to our partner Hotline in that country so they can investigate it within their own legislation and in cooperation with their national law enforcement agencies.

&gt;Whilst steps to have that content removed are in progress, the UK internet industry has voluntarily agreed to block access to them using a list provided by the IWF. We consider blocking to be a short-term disruption tactic which can help protect internet users from stumbling across these images, whilst processes to have them removed are instigated.

I believe they generally do block domains as opposed to content, and do so in a way that isn't particularly effective and, in principle, allows you to obtain a list of the sites that are blocked.  The IWF apparently refused to block a test site so that researchers could test the system without breaking the law, but you can generally get around these kinds of blocks quite easily (using a proxy based in another country or whatever), and presumably the images they want to block are usually shared by some other, less public, means than posting them on a website, so the whole system isn't necessarily all that worthwhile.

&gt; Plus as the IWF say they don't block whole domains typically, they block specific illegal content. 

As I understand it, the blocks are actually put in place by the ISPs on the IWF's request.  They might request that a specific image be blocked, but in practice it is far easier to block the domains on which the image is found than to filter out the specific image.

&gt; The IWF should operate a site themselves that lets you check the REAL list to see if something is listed.

true,hotcod,null,null,"Britain has one of the worlds worst rates of breastfeeding in the world and your chances of being breastfeed can go from 4 in 5 to 1 in 5 based purely on socio-economic status or so radio 4 was telling me this morning. This is an attempt to adjust that.

Is breastfeeding right for every one? No, I've just become an uncle and due to a combination of factors including a very difficult pregnancy my brothers wife has had to stop breast feeding. In fact my brother had to seriously put his foot down and insist that was what was going to happen because she wanted to be able to feed her baby her self regardless of how unhealthy it was turning out to be for her. 

There's unquestionably a lot of pressure on women to breastfeed but there seems to be many women who breastfeeding could be right for who aren't. Regardless of just how profound the effects are it's something we should be able to support. While I agree there needs to be a better balance this is really not aimed at women who are going to be upset if they can't breastfeed it's aimed at women who otherwise wouldn't be even if they can.

Right way to do it? I'm unsure and I agree this shouldn't be about dropping yet more pressure on women who want too... there's a lot of problems in that regard currently... but it's largely all a product of the fact that far fewer women breastfeed than really should be. Women who want to but can't seem to get the sharp end of a stick designed around women could but won't.

So the question is how do we deal with that? And the truth is I don't have a clue. It's very hard to create large social change with out making the people who have a valid reason to go against the grain feeling pressured. All I can say is that while I can understand why it might be imposable not to take personally it's not really about the people like you. From your other posts I've got no doubt that some staff and services need to be better trained to realise when breast feeding isn't the best course but that's a whole other matter.",0,1384261172,null,0,1384269278,0,cdchtz3,t3_1qfzyo,t1_cdchtz3,t1_cdcftyt,null,1428691927,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Your pension fund value is really not good, unless you're in your very early 20s and even then it's barely ""okay"". £200 per month on a £40,000 salary is way too low, if you want to enter retirement with anything reasonable your pension needs to have contributions of **at least** 20% of your pre-tax salary (so in your case £8,000 -- but it can be be made up of salary sacrifice, employer contributions, tax relief). The lack of employer contributions is really really not good, why does your employer not provide anything? I would expect an employer paying out £40k salaries would at least have a basic pension set up for employees. 

Unfortunately living in London is going to be your biggest problem, the cost of property in London is obscene and at the moment you really cannot afford to skip out on funding your pension... but also renting in London long term just puts you further and further behind. There's a lot of problems with your situation and I don't really feel comfortable trying to give advice because there's too much that could go wrong, however if I was in your situation I would be cutting every single non essential expense in my life to focus on saving for a deposit and I'd be looking at new employment, in your situation having an employer that doesn't contribute a penny to your pension is really not good.

true,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,"I'll post the comment I posted previously when this was last discussed:

There seems to be quite a lot of confusion about what the IWF do and what is causing this issue. Just to add a tiny bit of additional information about what is actually happening here:

The IWF hold a list of URLs which should be blocked, and on that list will be a number of specific URLs on the imgur domain which need to be blocked, most likely because they are hosting images which are illegal (child pornography). It is important to realise that it is only these specific images and not the entire imgur domain which is on the list.

So the ISPs have a number of ways to deal with this, an example of one of which is for them to respond to DNS requests with the IP address of their own filtering proxy servers. When this happens, you then access the entire imgur domain via their proxy, allowing them to identify which URLs are being accessed and filter content which is on the IWF block-list list on-the-fly.

So when an entire domain such as imgur becomes unavailable, what is actually happening is that there is an issue with the ISP and their proxy servers (or something to do with any one of the methods they may have for implementing the IWF block-list) meaning that they can't forward on requests to the actual imgur servers and therefore can't serve any (blocked or unblocked) material.

The IWF simply compiles a list of URLs which contain child pornography (the merits of this are a separate argument to be had, but personally I support what they're doing) and the specific issue affecting access to imgur here really is down to the ISPs blocking implementation.",0,1384264480,null,0,false,0,cdcik6g,t3_1qg3yi,t1_cdcik6g,t3_1qg3yi,null,1428691587,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Busby got his solely on the European Cup. A trophy Stein had already won and one that Paisley would win 3 times(also becoming the first Brit to retain it, a feat that Clough matched the next 2 seasons). 

Jimmy Hill should have gotten one. Army corporal after his national service which I might be wrong but started before the end of WWII. Then a very good playing career for Fulham during which he became chairman of the PFA and abolished the maximum wage for footballers, then coach, manager, director, and chairman of Coventry. Left that to become head of sport at LWT and introduced the world to panel punditry for football shows. Chairman of Fulham in the late 80's and stopped them from going bust. Was the main reason we have 3 points for a win. He also a spectator at a Liverpool Arsenal game at Highbury in the early 70's and after an injury to the linesman, ended up running the line so the game could continue.

So if a knighthood is given out this year I think that there are far more deserving people than Beckham.

Lets fast forward ten or so years. Great, you've just got your first house. Now it all needs are some carpets, wallpaper, maybe a new kitchen. But wait, remember you put off that pension ten years ago! We need to make that up. So having just bought your house now you need to deduct £350+ month (or more) from your income to get your pension up to the same level, when it would only have been £150 a month ten years ago. That's on top of your mortgage payments which will keep going up (interest rates are estimated to start rising from 2017 onwards), energy bills (currently in their 23rd year of rising by 15% per year!), and anything else that you've got to spend on for your house.



I cant see most people doing that. What i can see them doing is forgetting, suddenly realising in their 40's when they havent paid in for 20 years and then finding out the amount they need for a decent pension is now 30-40% of their income (remember we've got 20 years of no interest to make up for, plus the recommended half-your-age-as-a-percent contribution), which they cant afford to do.



Instead, by making your pension something that is a regular outgoing and is budgeted for in your finances, it doesnt get forgotten about, you end up with a decent pension pot. Yeah you might get a house a few years later for it, but in the long run, you'll be better off.",0,1384265398,null,0,false,0,cdcisfo,t3_1qd74q,t1_cdcisfo,t1_cdbyssx,null,1428691480,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

Basically the 3.9% rise is a threat to the government by EDF to get them to remove the green levy. They have said that if the government doesn't remove the green levy they'll have to have another increase in line with the other companies.

&gt; However, EDF warned that if the government failed to reduce green levies, the firm might have to put up its prices further.

My own personal take on this is they'll use this to get a ton of people to switch and then a month later go ""the government didn't reducy the levy so we're going to have to increase the price"".

They're all bastards, the lot of them. Even those who claim they're not such as Ovo who say they don't put up prices unless the wholesale increases, whacked up prices this year and then had their CEO say to a parliamentary committee wholesale prices haven't risen for the last few years.

No. This is the exact opposite (etc.) - I'm surprised if, as the person making that comment, you lived (or worked) in central London in the 70's-90's. If you'd been in the position of potentially being blown up over a period of time every day you went to work, are you really, seriously suggesting that people wouldn't have wanted cameras as a deterrent? Cameras have brought multiple benefits, not just as anti-terror devices. 'Plenty still goes on' is not the same as 'crime overall has gone down'.

Before cameras, women (and people generally) had a much riskier prospect walking down a high street alone late at night, using the tube, etc. - and they're generally at much less risk now using public transport or spaces than they were (An American Werewolf in London played on this wonderfully with the tube sequence, which shows you how old that movie is). People were far more casual with theft/ violence/ speeding etc. when, as long as no police were around, it was open season. Some still are (and always will be), but not to the extent they were ten, or twenty years ago - but that hasn't been achieved through harsher sentencing or more coppers on the beat. 'Plenty still goes on' is the sort of summary you get from from people that pretend that speed cameras haven't affected speeding because of the number of prosecutions (conveniently ignoring that the total number of drivers has gone up, making the number of prosecutions a smaller percentage).

However the above is a completely different situation to the one where GCHQ have the option of scanning emails - itself only 'shocking' to anyone that's never considered it - it's not as if they never opened anyone's letters before the internet. NT4 had a well-known back-door in it for the NSA, and that was in 1996....every journalist, blogger and citizen who actually cares about this sort of thing would have known about it already - you really need to look up what a police state actually is (and how it works) before you do your best to describe the UK as one, because 'crushing grip on the psyche of a nation' is just laughable. You're coming across as taking new initiatives and complaining that if they're not perfect from the outset, you don't want to play/ end of the world/ etc. while looking back at the past with rose-tinted specs under the apparent assumption that doing so means today is 'a fight for our humanity'. You could start with acknowledging that 'taking the other route' actually meant 'interfering with other countries in order to maintain cheap oil with any regional/ global stability gained as a fortunate by-product', which is why we *can't* go back to the way things were, because they actually weren't very nice.

Please give some more background on how you know all this before speaking on everyone's behalf on how they felt about being under threat of attack in London for decades -  ('We would have been utterly horrified' - sorry, not true to the point of comedy). 'Playing on the fears of immigrants? Sure, everyone thinks like the BNP, it's nothing to do with concerns about unchecked immigration over the past ten years and can *only* be connected to the war on terror (ask an Irishman what it was like living in London during the 70's - 90's, if you think this is all post-9/11 nastiness). And 'the IRA never bothered anyone'? *Really*? Statements like this really are laughably student-level, and you might be surprised to learn that GHCQ were perfectly capable of monitoring your communications and movements way before the internet (and that yes, most people were aware of the possibility, apparently before you were); nothing's changed, both then and now; they have the *option* of looking at your email, but 99.9% of the time, they won't care. Just like before the internet, in fact.

TLDR; There have already been far too many ignorant people on the likes of reddit recently that paint a utopia of what everything was like pre-9/11 so that they can rail against the way things are today; try making statements that demonstrate you're not one of them, because the above statements are (to paraphrase your abuse of those who don't agree with you) too stupid, lazy or intent on pushing your own agenda than dealing with the reality.",0,1384265890,null,0,1384346011,0,cdcix3a,t3_1q9my3,t1_cdcix3a,t1_cdavtdd,null,1428691421,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is my problem with Holtby, like Welbeck the fact that he is fit and 'a work horse' is the first thing that comes up whenever people are tying to compliment him. 

My issue with Holtby especially is that he runs around like a headless chicken on crack, presses on his own and rarely benefits the team because he fails to work as a cohesive unit. It seems a lot of the time that he is running for the sake of running and looking busy, because he doesn't have the footballing IQ to just roam into the right place.

I think Richard Keyes was the one who said that the most important statistic in football is one that is not measured- standing still. The best players don't look like they are working hard, because their hard work is going on in their brains, and they know when to just hold a position and trust the rest of the lads to deliver the ball- and if you look at the real top, top players in the league this is the case.

true,keraneuology,null,null,"Keeping in mind that I fully acknowledge that I have an incredibly defect in understanding and base my impressions only on things that I pick up here and there - and is fully subject to change as I come to understand things differently:

1. The monarchy/royalty in general.  The concept that some people are better than others (or perhaps not ""better"" but more deserving of respect and honor or such) just because of the accident of their birth is odious.  I understand that the Queen is more of a figurehead with quite limited powers these days - I hear many people call the royalty more of a tourist attraction than anything else (though I don't know if you would consider that to be insulting or not) but the concept that a specific person is born to be king/queen and never have to really work for it (or anything else) is quite distasteful.

To me (and probably many others) when we think of England we think ""queen"".  We are vaguely aware that the Prime Minister is really pulling a lot of the strings but ""queen/king"" is the first thing that comes to mind and as a nation with a proud history of having the right to not vote in elections that select our leaders (sadly, not a joke) that concept is just not very comfortable.

2. I am all for tolerance, but not when the tolerance comes at the expense of others.  In my perception it is far too easy for somebody to claim that they don't like something and somebody else has to change the way they do things.  Over the years I've come across stories along the lines of 'Muslim family moves in, doesn't like a particular billboard and the local government rushes to make sure it is banned'.  To be sure, this kind of thing is slowly creeping into the US way of doing things but there is quite a bit of resistance to it and it is slow, while my perception is that the UK government can't implement this concept fast enough.

3. The government seems to be more interested in catering to the very wealthy - all governments do this, but it seems to me that they rush into it faster.  The downtown congestion tax (or whatever they call it) that makes it un-affordable for many to drive downtown for example.  New York City is working on this idea but there is much resistance and the government at least pretends to be more accountable to the citizens over here.  In the US the government caters to the rich and famous but at least pretends to be impartial while my perception is that over there the rich/royal are explicitly designated to be untouchable and that their whims are openly favored.  The House of Lords ties into this as well - again, there is a close parallel in the US but at least every has the illusion of being able to aspire to the Senate regardless of their circumstance.

4. The government over there appears to me to be more restrictive and people are less likely to speak their mind on unpopular things.  Part of this may be cultural - nobody likes to shoot off their mouths and express their opinions than Americans - but from snippets that I pick up here and there I get the inkling that people are more likely to be prosecuted/punished if they say the wrong thing.  Yes, I know that people are free to say what they want over there but your country would never be able to have Art Bell, Al Sharpton and Rush Limbaugh have competing radio shows simultaneously - and even though there is much to chuckle at from the three I still relish in the fact that everybody can be as loony as they want to be.",0,1384267477,null,0,false,0,cdcjdwh,t3_1qejtp,t1_cdcjdwh,t1_cdciwkm,null,1428691202,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Ultimately (if you're lucky) it's a choice, although one you make for your child. It's the same as our knowledge about all the other things that we know harm us or those who we care for (unhealthy food for example, how many people feed their children incredibly unhealthy food with impunity), yet we choose to do them anyway.

I'm trying to point out three things:

*  That feeding breast milk does not necessarily mean ""breastfed"" in the way that the media and some medical professionals intend it. Yes milk can be delivered directly from the human breast to the baby, but it can also be delivered via a pump and bottles (there are even benefits to this method!). As far as I'm aware there, isn't much evidence to show that this is any difference between this and ""breastfeeding"" in terms of health and nutrition. 

* Some women unfortunately don't get the choice to feed their babies their breast milk. Those women should not be made to feel bad or be put under pressure or stress because of something they have no control over.

* That ultimately it is a choice, one that a parent or parents should be free to make for themselves and their child, without fear of being systematically discriminated against by medical professionals or the government (and somewhat by the media).",0,1384268826,null,0,false,0,cdcjtc4,t3_1qfzyo,t1_cdcjtc4,t1_cdchut1,null,1428691002,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Particular currents, eddies, and swirls can form in one place as the result of very particular circumstances. Large rocks formed a specific path. The riverbed had a particular depth and/or shape. The water was flowing at a particular speed. Innumerable variables contribute to that particular flow.

But ask an expert ""why"" and they'll likely say the rocks caused it - partly because they tend to think of the river itself and the surface of the riverbed as natural, immutable things, and rocks jutting up out of the river as interfering variables, and partly because the rocks had the greatest contributing influence.

You could replicate that rock arrangement precisely at some other point in the stream, but not get the same effect. That doesn't mean ""the rocks didn't cause it."" It means ""the rocks alone didn't cause it.""

Saving Pete Tyler wouldn't merely have removed Rose's motivation to go there and try to save him: By that point in their adventures, they had already seen Bad Wolf a few times. If Pete had lived, Rose very likely wouldn't have been living and working where she did. She very well might not have met the Doctor, and wouldn't have even come along for the ride - but Rose *was* the Bad Wolf. They didn't realize it at the time, but Rose's future had already zig-zagged across their path multiple times.

So there was more going on than just the normal ""if I do A then I wouldn't have done B, which is what enabled/motivated me to do A"" scenario. This was further evidenced by the broken nature of time itself: The phones going wonky, the TARDIS interior vanishing, the car crash looping, etc. These signs informed the Doctor that they had been in a kind of perfect storm setup, but the thing that finally tipped them off the cliff was Rose saving Pete. The Doctor didn't know all the other contributing factors, but he did know that the signs indicated a larger threat - one which could summon reapers.

Tell them that if they won't do this that you'll consider their contact to be harassment and take advice about what action you should take to remedy the situation. (By the way, putting it this way is fairly safe but will send the right message anyway)

If they think they've got a genuine grievance against you then they'll have to put up some information and go through with it. If not, this should shut them up. If they *still* go through with it, then they court will hopefully take a dim view, especially if they don't turn up to present evidence.

It discusses Doctor Who fandom, San Diego Comicon, and mentions a few well-known spoilers from the 50th anniversary [co-stars](#s ""David Tennant, Billie Piper, and John Hurt will play a 'dark' Doctor"" ) and the Holiday Special [new actor](#s ""Peter Capaldi will be the 12th Doctor"" ).

If you are a fan of Jenna, there's a lot there about her career, but little of it has to do with the character of Clara you see on screen. It's just behind the scenes information about Jenna.

*edit*: few Who spoilers, but if you watch the soap opera *Emmerdale* there are a *lot* of spoilers about Jenna's character Jasmine on that show.",0,1384273846,null,0,1384275889,0,cdcln0k,t3_1qcf3u,t1_cdcln0k,t1_cdbog5e,null,1428690151,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
